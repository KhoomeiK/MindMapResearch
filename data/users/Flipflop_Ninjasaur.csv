HadToHurt,ffdtxvy,t1_ffcqnaf,1579828846.0,It happened to me before and all I had to do was push it back out. There was a very visible bulge in my groin area where it went.
gatekeeping,ffd7dcq,t1_ffd3f59,1579814852.0,Well I'm subbed now.
gatekeeping,ffcqseg,t1_ffchy14,1579805310.0,Circle jerk subs are my jam. The only one I haven't been able to find is one about all the reddit 'pet experts.'
ShouldIbuythisgame,ffc89h7,t3_enem7q,1579793809.0,I'll vote for anyone who vows to annihilate any post asking about Witcher 3.
ShouldIbuythisgame,ffc86sk,t3_esuimz,1579793759.0,"I was pretty disappointed with FFXV. If you're into open-world games, you may enjoy it. But if you're looking for a traditional JRPG / Final Fantasy experience, you'll probably be pretty disappointed as well. The combat can be kind of fun once you get used to it but the story is really lackluster and disjointed."
AskReddit,ffc7p5g,t3_esr647,1579793447.0,3D Art. It's hard not to start hating it when you've been doing it for a living for like 10 years.
ShouldIbuythisgame,ffc7fz0,t3_espvhh,1579793283.0,"Shoot, I just bought Hades yesterday... Hopefully I haven't played 2 hours of it yet."
gaming,ffa8p9f,t1_ffa4xas,1579730056.0,1 and 2 were amazing. 3 was disappointing for me at least.
aww,ffa87id,t3_eser7p,1579729781.0,"One cat, come to see the veterinarian for love deficiency. Prescription: 100 CC's of pets, STAT."
funny,ffa7zlc,t1_ff9se8z,1579729658.0,"Eh, it's really not that bad usually. But the bad rap is totally deserved just because of how shitty they treat their employees."
boardgames,ff7a967,t1_feq73es,1579644455.0,"We picked up the base game and an expansion and we loved it.

I played Yzma and got my ass handed to me but I *loved* how it felt like I was actually playing Yzma from the movie. Tons of power, dealing with trying to get my morally challenged henchman to do what I want, and being ABSOLUTELY FRUSTRATED TRYING TO FIND THIS FUCKING LLAMA. 

Loool. Really fun time though, thanks again for the suggestion."
aww,ff6y05b,t3_erwcpn,1579637211.0,He's so ready to fight you over this water if you came any closer.
ffxiv,ff6jtq3,t1_ff6ew02,1579628728.0,Same... I can't imagine running a dungeon without helping out with DPS. I'd just be standing there for no reason most of the time.
Damnthatsinteresting,fesyyl5,t1_fer9rcj,1579370311.0,It annoys me that the people and the tree are pretty much 100% silhouette in the daytime without the sun directly behind them.
patientgamers,fepmtpx,t1_feo9qcx,1579324701.0,"If you like the L4D2 formula and don't mind epic store, try out WWZ! It's super fun."
patientgamers,fepmn0o,t3_eq6bqu,1579324548.0,"Little Nightmares. It's not really super 'unknown,' I just doubt people have played it. But it's one of my favorite games for sure."
ageofsigmar,fepksqy,t3_eq913c,1579323100.0,"Oh shutup, you painted them very well and you know it lol."
boardgames,fep1q8f,t1_feni9yu,1579310182.0,Now there's an A+ idea if I've ever seen one.
boardgames,fep1gcf,t1_feoxqvt,1579310007.0,"Oh, neat. So it's a game where you should pick a character or two and really get to know them instead of playing a whole bunch?"
darkestdungeon,fenrska,t1_fenlnxh,1579289833.0,That was some good soup we had the other week...
boardgames,fenirs4,t3_epzbvk,1579285583.0,Is this a good game for 2 players? Been looking at picking it up for some time but don't want another game on my shelf that turns out to be crappy for us.
WritingPrompts,fenaiow,t1_felxviv,1579280518.0,"I get the initial idea, sure. ""They'll pick all the losers and outcasts and nice people and all the corrupt people will be stuck on Earth."" But it totally wouldn't work that way. These aliens are dumbasses for choosing this method and they're going to get the criminals and the terminally ill."
AskReddit,felktyb,t3_epq4h9,1579224582.0,Cherries. I'm allergic to them. That's it.
Gamingcirclejerk,fekhqlg,t1_fej6hda,1579200290.0,"I actually saw this review on steam and had a good laugh over it. It's for a VR strip-club game called ""VR Paradise"" if I'm recalling correctly."
rickandmorty,feicycb,t1_fehlrot,1579135598.0,"I haven't pointlessly hated anything as much as I fucking hate this ""nobody"" meme in years."
Grimdank,fegu2ct,t1_fegmfek,1579102542.0,"Blackstone is more of a board game. Kill Team is more similar to 40k but instead of entire units, you have a team of individual models who each have their own rules. Oversimplified but I hope it gets the point across."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fefcq5u,t1_fef136j,1579053480.0,Thanks for the elaboration! Sounds like something I may enjoy next time it's on sale.
ShouldIbuythisgame,feescd3,t1_fccy819,1579040168.0,You haven't really said anything good about Code Vein. Just curious if you would expand: Why would you still recommend playing it?
funny,feede1o,t3_eomeuu,1579031445.0,So unnerving how it's a metal pole but it still has a perfectly realistic human foot on the end.
boardgames,feb1um3,t3_eo7xz7,1578954640.0,"As someone whos favorite game is Cosmic Encounter but doesn't have anyone other than my SO to play it with:

YESS YESS YEEEESSSSSS."
aww,fe3k339,t1_fe3hccl,1578849988.0,It's harder to grow carrots than just dropping a bunch of them on the ground.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdlwuih,t1_fdls6u7,1578534412.0,Same with a lot of Reddit comments really.
magicTCG,fdlhe6z,t1_fdktrdp,1578524065.0,Yyyyup... I've been trying to make a non GW deck because my main deck is Selvala but they all tend to lack the punch green brings. The best I've managed is 5-color with few green cards.
AskReddit,fdit6tt,t3_elgpmo,1578450489.0,"Mandatory? No. I don't believe in forcing people to do anything they don't want to. 

Would it be nice to have it covered by insurance just the same as physical health or just be available to everyone regardless of finances? Hell yeah. Of course it would. Who's going to say they wouldn't want that?"
AskReddit,fdic3jx,t3_eled64,1578439556.0,"Pet ""circle-jerkers.""

AKA people who see gifs or videos of animals posted on reddit and use all their ANIMAL EXPERTISE to diagnose something wrong with the animal or tell you how exactly you're abusing it or not raising it properly, all from the less than one minute video. And then it gets upvoted straight through the roof and everyone else bandwagons on.

If anyone has a circle-jerk subreddit like r/gamingcirclejerk or r/moviescirclejerk where they make fun of these people, please let me know."
ffxiv,fdhj4lk,t1_fdhbg7s,1578423739.0,The red panda will also sit on your shoulder.
patientgamers,fdh8o3r,t1_fdgwjry,1578417784.0,"Agree completely with your bicycle metaphor. I played about 100 hours before I beat the game, but once I got to that point I can pretty much beat Dragun in any run where RNG doesn't completely screw me. It's a game you gotta stick with and enjoy the journey. Still one of my favorite games to this day."
aww,fde6ls0,t1_fddlwk9,1578332315.0,"In general, you shouldn't listen to anyone on reddit about pet crap. They're usually over-generalized assumptions. There's only so much you can tell from a 10 second gif or video on reddit: none of those things being the experience the owner actually has with their animals and those animal's individual personalities and behaviors."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fde1alm,t1_fddkmw0,1578328925.0,"You can rebind the controls. I had to do the same.

With that said, I liked the DMC remake more than DMC5. Unpopular opinion for sure, but it goes on sale often enough to make it worth a shot."
ageofsigmar,fddx4kg,t1_fddedjw,1578326118.0,Skaven hates everybody. Skaven even hates Skaven.
worldwarzthegame,fdct18r,t3_ekhee2,1578283496.0,"> I especially see this on chapter 1 of New York.

Probably because that's the first level the game ""tells"" you to play and it's a bunch of new people."
gwent,fd07syz,t1_fcxz8xj,1578114915.0,"Hearthstone has similar consistency issues and its ""mainstream."""
AskReddit,fcylpug,t1_fcyl4aw,1578082330.0,"Yeah, I thought about that too but the story was believable. Eventually, I just ended up cutting them both out of my life so it all worked out in the end I guess lol."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fcxvqqf,t3_ejfgse,1578071229.0,"Blasphemous on steam. Haven't played it too much but so far it's pretty fun.

World War Z on epic store. Very fun game with friends. Very good deal for only like $5."
AskReddit,fcxmosg,t3_ejdlbw,1578066613.0,"An old co-worker, ex-teacher. I kind of looked up to her and thought she was really cool, very talented, very down to earth, etc.

Then another coworker told me that she called me ""a little bitch"" at a team lunch and I swear, she could jump off a cliff now and I wouldn't give a shit."

WinStupidPrizes,fcvd4x1,t3_ej00k0,1577999603.0,"I did this same exact thing to a kid a few years younger than me who threw a basketball at the back of my brother's head for absolutely no reason while he was sitting down next to the basketball court.

I knew it was justified in some sort of way but it still makes me feel shitty."
magicTCG,fcul32q,t1_fcuh8ms,1577983380.0,"Honest answer, as a Warmachine player: Even though I vastly prefer Warmachine, I still play Age of Sigmar more just because the playerbase is *so much larger.* It's super hard to find someone to play Warmachine/Hordes in my area but you can't throw a stone without hitting someone who plays Warhammer."
magicTCG,fcugkli,t1_fcudu84,1577980449.0,"Yep, Warmachine doesn't really have tanks."

horror,fctbqhf,t3_eikedf,1577938325.0,I can't help but watch almost every horror movie as a spin-off of it ever since I saw Cabin in the Woods and fell madly in love with it.
MaliciousCompliance,fcoxn8y,t1_fco1bdv,1577844409.0,"Ugh, screw the night shift. Worked 9-6 and my life basically became work-sleep-work repeat."
AskReddit,fcmh24b,t3_ehtq3g,1577774980.0,"Tarot and oracle decks. I think it's an amazing way for artists to showcase their art and I love the symbolism in the cards. In a pinch, actually using them is a fantastic way to ""meditate"" on issues and help yourself think objectively."
DunderMifflin,fcm8tb7,t1_fclzw4b,1577767314.0,Is it worse than the dumpster fire of The Dark Tower?

horrorlit,fcaqn73,t3_egvxn7,1577574663.0,"Published in 2007 but I'm just reading it now. I think The Haunted Forest Tour would make a great ""Cabin in the Woods""-esque creature film."
boardgames,fc0tioo,t1_fc081v9,1577299290.0,"Wingspan as well from my girlfriend. Very awesome game so far. 

Picked up A Fake Artist Goes To New York for myself. Haven't played it yet but I've heard good things."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fbzdh7d,t3_ef8o1c,1577243065.0,"Agreed. I should really just unsub because it's the same shit all the time. All the posts asking about unusual games just get ignored or downvoted to hell.

If you want to see this sub improve, the community itself needs to improve. Make a new year's resolution here: DOWNVOTE posts asking about games you see posted a lot (Witcher, etc) and upvote posts asking about non-popular games."
