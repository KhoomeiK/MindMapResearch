I even searched the house. It's a big house and the door was often left unlocked, who knows right?"
AskReddit,feuivsw,t3_eqies2,1579386912.0,"I've posted this before.

I was living for three summers in a big old house that served as the Rectory (Church house) for a church where I was working. The Minister was in-and-out all summer, and I was also there to housesit while he was on vacation.

At the time I was really into sleep tracking apps, and particularly sleep-noise-recording apps to see if I could hear myself talking in my sleep.

I ran it almost every night and never heard a single interesting thing. I barely snore, so I would hear the odd siren outside, the bed creaking as I rolled over, breathing, a fart, etc.

One morning when I was alone in the house (Minister on vacation)  and I opened the app to playback noises from the night before - all the usual stuff until the second to last recording.

The recording was from around 3:30/4 in the morning. You can clearly hear me breathing and that I am not rolling around or moving much. If I had rolled or gotten up the app would have recorded it as it was an old and creaky bed.

Suddenly, as you hear me breathing, there comes the noise of three very distinct and unmistakable raps of knuckles on wood, followed by a two second pause, and the snapping of fingers.

**tap...tap...tap......snap**

It was super unnerving especially because there was no evidence that it was me doing it.

It bothered me enough that I set the phone back down on the night stand and tried to recreate the noise from anywhere that I could reach while laying on the bed - the frame, the bedside table, the nearby bookcase, but I could never get it exactly or figure out what wood was being tapped on. Whatever the case, the noise was distant enough that it could not have come from anywhere that I could have reached while lying in the bed.

I have never been prone to sleep walking, talking, or even getting up in the night to go to the bathroom, so I am quite certain it wasn't me.

This is something that has stuck with me and for which I have no answer."

I guess all I would add about myself, expanding on what you say about the Lemon Street Market, is that I try not take photographs of things with which I do not have a connection.

While my hope is that I produce an aesthetically pleasing photograph for people to look at, my greater and more important hope is that the photograph can evoke some feeling in the person, that it can help them to connect even in some small way with how *I* connect to the subject. 

Maybe it's connecting to how I felt looking at this subject, maybe it's a subject I know very well and have some personal connection to and want to share that, maybe it's the connecting people with how it felt to be standing there taking the photo - this is all the storytelling aspect of stills photography that moves me to shoot. Capturing something nice looking for the sake of itself isn't my bag, and consequently neither is wedding photography or paid portrait work.

I've always tried my best to get the best and most accurate photo out of the camera as I can, one which doesn't require loads of work in post, and even then (having done a lot of darkroom stuff) I only do what might be reasonably done in a darkroom.

Where once digital photographers and videographers likely would have been coming into the public sphere or even the hobby with some experience, now anyone with a $400 camera can produce nice *looking* photos and videos, and sees others doing the same which inevitably leads us to think that our content is as good and worthy of being shared around.

Anglicanism,fe53shc,t3_entrer,1578865424.0,"I'll jump in and make a lot of generalizations.

Anglicanism in North America, at least, has long been associated in one way or another with the elite. 

In Canada, given our connection to the Crown, Anglicanism *was* a religion associated with the upper crust and really had a place of prominence in public life while not being a state religion in quite the way it is in the UK. It was the denomination of the Ottawa and Toronto elite and powerful, of politicians, judges, lawyers, etc.

In the States and especially along the Eastern Seaboard the Episcopal church was likewise associated with power and money. It would, of course, been the predominant church of the wealthy and powerful in the thirteen colonies prior to the rebellion of/around 1776 and so those families who were not loyalists and remained in the States following independence stayed with their wealth and sent their progeny to Yale, Dartmouth, Harvard, and so on. The remnant of all of this is still visible today in many Episcopal parish finance reports, methinks.

This is to say that Anglicanism in both Canada and the US had an air of being fairly dry, made up largely of well-educated, upper middle class+, wealthier families who would be more likely to wear things like tweed jackets and moleskin pants - things that the working classes were not wearing.

Through all of this, I think, that stereotype of tweed/blazers/gin/sherry was born and persists, though is being broken down by the church expanding outside of those WASPy strongholds and welcoming people who don't wear Brooks Brothers, Polo, or know how what a sherry glass looks like."

No, but in truth (and I know this from when I bought my 40D way back), as a beginner your photos would not be immediately better just by virtue of having a more expensive camera. It's easy to think that way, but you would be just as green with an A7 as you would with this.

After a few years of getting to know my 40D I could get some really fantastic images, but I remember thinking in the beginning - ""is this it?!"" and being disappointed with my shots.

Use this as an opportunity to learn how to take great photos, learn the strengths and limitations of your camera and adjust accordingly, and don't feel bad about the purchase. Not only is it a very fine camera, it's a very fine beginner camera and if you put the time into learning it and the craft, it will offer you a great deal in return and prep you for an upgrade."

The lake has a few cabins on it and they all know each other and own the land around the lake. Short of a portage in the only way to get to a place to launch a boat is by a road with a gate across it.

The guy who made the gate (one of the cabin owners) made it in such a way that every key holder has their own padlock on the gate which unlocks the gate. 

So my friend drives up to this gate with 8 padlocks all in a row, steps out, unlocks his (one) padlock and opens the gate.

Maybe this is super simple to achieve mechanically, but it blew my mind when I saw it. Super cool."

I am a photographer, not a videographer, but I plunked my m50 onto the tripod today to record a video. Admittedly the light was *not* ideal for video and if I were to do this in a more professional way I would use lighting, but I noticed that with the ISO set 1600 the video was *grotesquely* noisy in a way that my photos are not at 1600.

I am just wondering with a camera like this if video makes noise more noticeable?"
Anglicanism,fdxt09y,t3_enbr57,1578772581.0,"That's a pretty tough question to answer for how broad it is, though it's not a bad question.

I have had a lot of interaction with various Orthodox communities over the years and certainly feel more a kinship and sympathy with them theologically, liturgically, and ecclesially, than I do with Rome despite being a former Roman Catholic.

However one thing that I can't quite get over and that would be a major impediment to my conversion is how ethnic the various Orthodox churches are, by which I mean how large of a role being Russian, or being Greek, or being Arabic plays in them and how - at least for a lot of my friends who have converted - it seems like one must take on that ethnic component in some way whether or not you are Russian/Greek/Arabic. And if it's not taking on some of that identity you are at least surrounded by it. I know non-mid-east folks who've attended local Antiochian churches and found it very hard because they are part of a very small minority of *non*-mid-east people attending; ditto for Russian churches.

None of this, of course, means you cannot convert and be happy, but it has always seemed to me that for people not of the culture of the given church it can be an impediment to becoming part of the fabric of a parish. I think this is also something is probably going to fade in the coming decades as more and more converts/non-immigrant folks find faith in the Orthodox Church, but for the moment it's something both my Wife (who attended a Russian church for a while) and I have noticed."

Recently getting back into photography more seriously after a few years hiatus and buying a new camera. I've been putting my stuff up on Instagram lately and while I've been finding some cool people and cool stuff I've noticed some new trend that I am not quite into, but can't quite classify.

It's this trend of taking super edited, ultra-moody pictures with peoples' backs toward the camera.

My whole bloody feed and my explore is chocked full of these cool-temped landscapes with lots of fade and colour adjustment...and someone standing there with their back to the camera.

The thing that bothers me is that so many of the photos are actually great landscape photos. They are of some beautiful location, they are obviously carefully composed and shot, but then ruined (IMO) because *every single one of them* has this person with their back to the camera placed in the most interesting, eye-catching, line-leading part of the composition ruining what could have been an A+ landscape shot.

I suspect that this is simply the *soup de jour* of IG because all of these shots have an obscene number of likes and people seem to like them, but it's certainly not something I ever noticed happening before IG.

Does this 'style' have a name, why is it so popular, and where did it come from?"

nottheonion,fdngygl,t1_fdmy1jp,1578585583.0,"Not being an apologist for it - and speaking about the Catholic and *not* Mormon church, which I know nothing about - priests in the Catholic Church do not offer absolution for sins without clear indications of repentance.

In the Catholic world it isn't a free ticket to be a dick or to continue harming people. 

If someone confessed to such things in a Catholic confessional a priest cannot offer any kind of spiritual absolution to someone unless they demonstrated that they were both sorry for what they did and willing to amend their lives (the purpose of absolution/reconciliation) - which would chiefly be shown through turning oneself in for the crimes.

Now this is likely all foolishness to the unreligious who don't care about or believe in spiritual confession/absolution, but chances are if someone with a guilt-ridden conscience is finding themselves in a confessional booth with a priest they *do* believe in it and care about it.

Murderers and child molesters don't confess their crimes to priests for fun. And so withholding absolution is used to bring the person to turn themselves in.

As others have said the laws surrounding the seal of the confessional and privacy protections are all complicated and vary from place to place."

I pay more at the outset and then literally use it every day for 10 years with little to no worry (outside of some unforeseen defect). In all my years of PC computing *no* computer has offered me this and none have even come close to the ten year mark.

In my mind it is absolutely worth the cost at the outset. My only beef/fear with new generations of Mac laptops is the non-upgradability. Being able to chuck more ram and an SSD into my 2012 is what has made it a perfectly acceptable daily driver - I am not sure that the current ones will be as capable in the same way in ten+ years."
