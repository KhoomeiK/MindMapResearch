politics,fefypb8,t1_fefuyb1,1579069735.0,"I appreciate that we're on the same boat just different ends. Politicians will look dramatically different in 4 years as the last of the millennials will be in there late 20's and the oldest of the Gen Z'ers will be in their early to mid 20's and the baby boomers becoming an increasingly dwindling group. The idea of enacted lasting change is nice but just another tagline to help swing voters, that like other taglines will fade.

What we need is a teacher. We need someone with the ability to unite the people under a common goal, something that Amys record doesn't prove. A democratic society is strongest when it can find a common ground and build on that commonality and from here we can elect those to enact laying change. 

I would like a smart, charasmatic, and committed president that will guide the people and help rebuild our relationships with our allies and hopefully build new ones, and frankly there is only one guy running  who looks to have those characteristics."

What the American people want is someone who isn't a politician to fix the things that hurting the middle and lower class american, thats what got Trump elected in the first place. We need someone who understands these problems and the brains and common sense to fix them. Then and only then might the American people want to give career politicians a second chance."

Some may say even closer than those who actually know how to handle these catastrophic series of events and possibly save the millions of lives by not starting another war that will last for another two decades....
