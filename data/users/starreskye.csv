AskReddit,fek34al,t3_epfjje,1579191596.0,"Went to open a glass storm door at my friends house; it was locked. (Normally we’d just push it open but the lock had gotten bumped down somehow) 

My hand went right through the glass part of the door. Yikes. But that wasn’t even the most painful part. The part that really hurt was my friends mom putting pressure on my wrist on the way to the hospital."

jewelry,feg01mg,t3_eoxflp,1579071212.0,"I don’t know about the higher, but I have a 10k white gold band and it’s never given me any issues. No irritation or anything. Still pretty white , no yellowing and is pretty heavy and sturdy feeling. It’s about 21 years old as it was my dads but he couldn’t wear it anymore. My moms engagement ring is also 10k white gold and it looks really good and she wears it pretty much constantly. 

Best of luck on your search!"

AskReddit,fecq30m,t1_fec5c88,1578980518.0,Honestly yes. Was the first anime that I really watched and I kinda love it. Afterwards I just couldn’t understand why no one else seemed to like it as much as me. (Then again I was like 14 ) but know I see all the reasons but un-ironically ? I’ll still watch it if I’m taking a sick day and just wanna watch anime
