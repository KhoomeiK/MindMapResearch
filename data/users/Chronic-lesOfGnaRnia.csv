I've heard of people putting their children in the tub, putting pillows on them, and laying next to it. The pillows probably won't do shit but if something decently small falls, it'll at least SOMEWHAT protect them from sharp edges. But if a tornado is hitting your house, what else are you going to do? That's the only box that has any rigidity to protect you. So SOMETHING. 

If you're LUCKY, you'll be somewhere that has a walk-in cooler. My friend was at a gas station in Parkersburg when the F5 hit in '08 and they all hid in the walk-in cooler. He said the sound and pressure change was insane but when it finally passed, they pushed the door open and they were outside. The building was basically gone. 

Long story short, you do anything to protect yourself from a wind demon. Anything. And I guarantee if you look outside and see one on a b-line to your house, you won't hide in a closet or just stand there.

No. This is not safer AT ALL. The only explanation I can come up with is that the tornado sirens didn't go off. Because, you can hear those fuckers ANYWHERE. And when they go off, you're supposed to take shelter. If you have a downstairs, go there. If you don't, you're supposed to lay down in a bathtub. The tub will protect you from a falling banister, hopefully. And cross winds. That's another reason why this was retarded. The wind doesn't kill you. It's the shit IN the wind that will kill you. There are countless pictures of a piece of straw having been thrown through a tree due to the high winds. Now imagine your fleshy body and maybe it's a fence post. So getting in your car is full blown stupid if you know a tornado is on the ground. 

And if it's an F5 and you're in a single floor house, your best defense is a prayer, lucky rabbits foot, four leaf clover, etc. You saw how quickly this tornado blew through. Now imagine if that fucker was 300+mph winds and a mile wide in all directions. Best of luck.
