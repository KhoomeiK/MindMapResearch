The issue is that if the dog is found not to be a service dog (not task trained, or the handler is not disabled, for example) at the time the handler claimed it was the handler can be fined, required to preform public service, and in some states I think jailed.

Of course, there are many other people who believe places of public accommodation shouldn't have to, for example, be wheelchair compliment or safe for the blind to navigate independently, such as with a cane. 

But both these opinions or ""complaints"" are morally wrong. Humans take care of each other. Humans have always taken care of each other, like many many pack animals before us.

It's twin size and 18 pounds.

It can go through large washers on a cold and gentle cycle. I keep it in a duvea cover though to keep dog hair off it and minimize the need to clean it.

The blanket is made to fit the bed EXACTLY and have nothing hanging off which could pull the blanket to the floor. Because of this the duvae cover can be a bit of a pain. There's a lot of empty space inside.

My SAD light is actually ""alarm clock light"" that starts out deep dark orange and becomes a bright bright white over the course of an hour to help wake up naturally.

In case you'll benefit from the reminder *If you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all.*"
dogswithjobs,fdbxbi9,t1_fdbq157,1578263398.0,"How does a flat collar or a head halter or a chess harness or any number of other training tools work without causing pain?

Truthfully, you can yank a lot harder on a prong collar than you can on a flat collar because it does distribute the weight. So in a sense you can be a lot more intense and cruel before seriously injuring a dog. But just because that's possible, and it's possible to stab a dog with a prong collar, doesn't mean the tool is cruel.

You can break a dog's neck with a gentle leader, and, I suspect, if used incorrectly, say, on a very small dog on a 25 foot flexi lead, a dog could break its own neck.

It, and all those other tools, provide pressure and probably some amount of discomfort to encourage the dog to move in a particular way, but it's up to the handler to communicate with the dog about what the sensation means. (Have you never seen someone yank on a dog with a flat collar until it sounds like it's choking?) What I mean to say is, a prong collar is not inherently more painful than another tool.

Like I've said elsewhere, my dog would have choked herself out and possibly done serious injury to her wind pipe if I insisted on training lose leash walking with a flat collar. She hates the gentle leader as well and would have scratched her face until she bled, and, I suspect, has damaged her eyelid, from the very short time I tried to help her adjust to it before giving up.

If I generalized my experience to all dogs then I would have to claim that both flat collars and gentle leaders are cruel tools.

""popping"" a prong collar like ""popping"" a flat collar can just be a method to get a dog's attention in a case where the ""watch me"" command won't work. You never want to give a dog a command you are not confident they will follow.

For example, if I want my dog to ignore a cat or another dog, I might pop her prong collar and then say ""leave it"" when I see the moment her attention has been broken.

Thanks for being open to listening and I hope this helped."
dogswithjobs,fdb65xm,t1_fdb3v5z,1578254258.0,"Wow you don't even know what a prong collar is. Incredible. Incredible.

That's like saying you think you shouldn't muzzle a dog when it's wearing a gentle leader.

Since you lack basic information about prong collars - the prongs don't stab. They distribute the weight of a pull on the collar more evenly across the neck. When I first was teaching my dog to walk with a loose leash a prong collar was mandatory because I worried she would collapse her airway or choke herself out as she pulled (even as I stood still!). On a flat collar, when a dog pulls, all that weight is focused on a small point on the dog's windpipe.

And if you're going to routinely be using a ""pop"" leash correction you don't want a flat collar or a head halter because that's dangerous.

Now you know!

Obviously a mass market training tool isn't designed for stabbing! But go head and show your entire ass I guess."

Just because the dog  doesn't repeatedly let go and re bite doesn't somehow make this single bite okay or less bad.

In fact, I think you'll find sources that show trained IPO dogs bite harder and do more damage than untrained dogs.

So yeah, if the court finds anything wrong with this situation, like maybe the cops not actually telling him to surrender because there isn't any sound on the clip, the city will be paying for those medical costs.

I've been in therapy since I was five, with one short, disastrous 2 year break. I've had to therapist shop. I'm on medication. I've done work books. I didn't realize how many things are part of my treatment plan even before I introduced a dog into my life.

* Aroma therapy (which after some sleep hygiene habit building was able to completely replace my need for a benzo)
* Meditation practice (which took a long time to perfect)
* Yoga and physical therapy (as it turns out not being in pain helps with all of my symptoms, mental health related and otherwise)
* Gratitude journaling
* SADD lighting
* A routine, although I struggle with it
* A weighted blanket
* Various work books, book books, and other resources explaining mental health and tools to combat different symptoms
* And, of course, talk therapy and medication

It took time for it to become clear to me that an SD was never my first step. It felt like it, because it's what I turned to the moment I realize I could not live as an independent adult. But I've tried so many other things. It's not my fault that my treatment plan wasn't enough to grant me success when I went off to college.

I know, of course, this is not what you're talking about. Funnily enough, it was seeing the posts you're talking about and defending ESAs as part of a treatment plan (mine, although she is a retired owner trained service dog as well, provides cuddles, warmth, breath, a heart beat, love.

It makes me so sad to see, teenagers especially, who do not have supportive family and do not have access to the health care they need, think that this is something they can just... do. It's not easy. Like you said, it's not the first step.
