AskReddit,fefu8r1,t1_fe966uy,1579065371.0,"Lots of great advice here. Things kind of are tougher for young people in certain environments, like I live in the rust belt and there are people working entry level in fast food in Cali that make as much or more than I do here! It is said we have a great economy, low unemployment, but many of those are gig/contracting jobs so its def an employers market.

I def didnt see it coming though, like I wish I was able to do software development or something in a growing field, but my work experience is mainly in IT infrastructure, deployments, etc and I dont have any financial support so I have to keep on working to put food on the table. As far as quitting that is tough as well, as I think it best to try to at least get unemployment benefits since it takes weeks/months sometime to get a new job. Most jobs here pay min wage to the high teens if you are lucky per hour so most of us dont have a nest egg and have to continue working. The place I am at now is not that bad, but yeah if Im not growing then I do need to find something else, but not going to just quit because I do need something still coming in every month. 

Sometime I look abroad, like ASia, but its not going great there either. Would be nice to just get out of the country a bit, breathe a bit easier, but have to go where the money and better wages are. Anyway I'll have to just keep on applying and hopefully find places that see potential in people and try to build them up/grow, thats how things get better in the world!"
AskReddit,fe6ge8w,t1_fe65olk,1578890100.0,"Yeah I know but America is still a country somewhat based on appearance and attractiveness. If I work with computers and then have a whole calendar year where I am working non computer jobs/not working, it just doesnt look good, so thats why I put I worked at that seasonal short term computer job, but thinking on it more I might remove it, esp if the corporations ghosts people they might badmouth them as well, and then I'll just have to hopefully tell a tale that they would understand.

It's such a shame these days because many of these companies dont care about people, like the one I was at probably worth like billions of dollars and then they would just hire/fire people like if it was a burger flipping job, while most people on main street, they are looking to pay their bills, continuity of work and attractiveness in the market. What is 15$ an hr to a billion dollar corporation, it just seems petty? Sometimes I wish was European or somewhere else, where its okay if you take a vaca, siesta or whatever. But here many of the guys I've worked with, we work every weekday except major holidays, and some do that as well. Where people are afraid to take a break/vacation is kind of messed up imo"
AskReddit,fe639ss,t1_fe62h7h,1578880806.0,"Perhaps I should, but I thought that future employers calling past employers are not allowed to say more than the dates worked (this is in Ohio). The company kind of ghosted me so I am not even sure what the real problem was or what they would say about me. The trouble these days is getting good legit jobs/interviews so the danger is with gaps they might not even call you in. But yeah I'll figure it out as my contract now is ending soon as well."
AskReddit,fe630f3,t1_fe62hqi,1578880639.0,"No unf I used credit cards and live at home, and they had an extensive process to get in (tests, checks, paperwork). A lot of low level IT contracting jobs are like that, so you kind of have to save money while you can. A few of the guys had driving job side hustles but my van is like 30 years old. Anyway even though I am trying to develop an IT career, I might just do some non contracting jobs and study in my free time, a lot of these types of jobs are more trouble then they are worth so much so its hard to study or move up in."
AskReddit,fe62ke7,t1_fe5zgxl,1578880360.0,"Yeah I've mostly worked as an IT contractor last couple years. The job was to help with the holiday season rush, and I was very out of the loop what was going on, but perhaps the volume of work dipped. One girl did high volume and then they said she ghosted them. Two others left. And then on my off day a week before christmas the recruiter told me I was done there (with a vague explanation), even though I had like 3 weeks left to go on my contract (to about new years to finish off the holiday season). So I guess they ghosted me, and then I had to wait 3 weeks for the recruiter to go onsite and get my stuff. This was a large corporation, but I hadnt been treated like that since like high school!

I pretty much included it because that year was very spotty for me work wise doing mostly gig/non-IT work and had a botched surgery that caused an infection so I couldnt work for a few months. Anyway I am working now, but this contract will end soon as well. Unf much of my resume are jobs less than a year because of it.

Reason I work so many hours is because we're responsible for like 10K machines and when they cut ppl due to infighting and whatnot they never replaced them, so lots of unpaid OT. It's as we call it, the ""Amazon model"" where you do whatever work they tell you to do, or they'll find someone else in an employers market. As contractors we make prob less than 30k a year no benefits or anything (closer to 20K after taxes), but they do reimburse for parking!

I know that starting a family in Korea would be very tough because the Korea educational system is harsh enough and it may be difficult since the child will probably look different.

Lobbyists and big interest groups run the country, and healthcare is no different, they are the reasons all the insurance/high copays/ paperwork is a clusterf*. We just dont know how to change it or if our votes even count."

StackAdvice,fcrn0fx,t1_fcrczej,1577903942.0,"I am in IT too and its tough, because need to deal with high volume, always be on the ball so I sometimes take adhd meds. Problem is it can def lead to a bit of speediness and then later in the day depression. IT too now wants great customer service, so I was thinking of taking ssri too but everyone Ive tried caused some sort of issue, like one was good but a nonstop pulsating back of the head. Im glad you found one that worked for you, was it one of the newer ones? Perhaps also try alpha brain or onnit products"

teachinginkorea,fco2xq2,t1_fccaetu,1577823073.0,"Eh it cant be that bad these days. I live in the rust belt now, ppl are politically divided, you have to watch your speech everywhere you go (PC), culture wars going on. Then dont forget there are more guns than ppl here. I almost got car jacked at Rallys near the community college, then my car was ransacked while I was working 3rd shift downtown metro hospital so I can pay off cc minimums, when pulled over by the police, it can sometime be like flight of the valkyries (hands up dont shoot)! Havent been back to Korea in years but sounds like bliss compared to here."
teachinginkorea,fco12gs,t1_fcbg1wg,1577822171.0,"I agree, its what you make of it. Having to work not just on teaching but at maintaining good relations with coteachers. Also having hobbies outside of the classroom. Like just drinking/partying, etc can also exacerbate any MI, but take it from someone here in the states working 50-60 hrs a week but still barely treading water... Korea will give you time to do what you want to do which Id trade for a few bucks less an hr any day"
teachinginkorea,fco0ass,t1_fcbs4yi,1577821775.0,"Depends on where home is though. Here in the states all prices going up, no rent control (so much goes to that), wages have went up a bit, but the main problem with the economic number.... most added jobs are gigs/pt/contracting... aka they can overwork/underpay you. 50k might be decent like in a poor rust belt city, but in the better/bigger cities, etc that will be barely breaking even or be poverty like in the premier cities."
teachinginkorea,fcnysqh,t1_fc709jw,1577821049.0,"Im sorry that has happened. Honestly last time I taught was over 5 years ago and back then I really enjoyed my time in Korea and met many interesting, well educated people. EPIK was helpful, the schools had lots of events, and had a good time teaching in 3 different provinces.

So I am guessing things have changed on a whole? Perhaps its just bad luck of the draw? Usually EPIK would have westerner leaders so they were helpful when I was in a pinch so hopefully they are still there for their teachers. 

I ended up leaving because of family reasons but now that is sorted I was looking into possibly coming back but we'll see. I do remember some of the anxiety was also of my own doing at that time as Kland is a drinking culture, so I know I would need to curtail that. Also Seoul has some pdocs who can help if in need of some assistance."
teachinginkorea,fcnxso9,t1_fc78qcx,1577820530.0,"Lol I know working with coteachers is kind of an art. You have to try to accomodate them as much as possible because after all they do a lot for NETs and sometimes are even paid less. But some places in America, Im talking about in big cities Baltimore, Cleveland, Chicago or small towns, well one can just look at a daily US newspaper and sees whats going on!"

As far as your credentials, I'd say you are over qualified in a good way. If paperwork/interview is good then I think you wouldn't have a problem being placed as long as there are spots still open."
teachinginkorea,fcnvghm,t1_fciz72d,1577819229.0,"Agreed no need to use profanity here where people are trying to help each other. I think Korea will do well to experience people from all walks of life. After all there are over a billion muslims in the world, so it'll help broaden horizons."

teachinginkorea,fc68ge8,t1_fc2rgat,1577474680.0,"I know what you mean man, here in America lots of jobs they understaff and overwork you. Some days I work 10-12 hrs but only paid for 8 and then I have a 2 hr round trip drive home. How do you work part time over there though, I thought all schools you have to be there at least 40 hours, and when not teaching still have to seat warm?"
teachinginkorea,fc673vr,t1_fc2ah8a,1577473785.0,"Thats a very good and encouraging response, esp because everyone situation is different and depends on the type of person and the school environment they get assigned.

teachinginkorea,fc66s3f,t1_fc0ozvx,1577473567.0,"A lot of Korea is focused more about the appearance of things. So as long as you and the paperwork all look good, I wouldnt worry about it. Less is more, and if you focus on doing a good job and fitting in, then it shouldnt be a problem."
