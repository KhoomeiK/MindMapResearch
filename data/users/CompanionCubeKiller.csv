dating_advice,fgpm401,t3_ezks7i,1581007558.0,"Yep. 31F and never been in a relationship. I don't develop feelings very often, and when I do, they hit me hard. And they're always for people that I'm already friends with and know fairly well. Unfortunately, they only ever want friendship from me. So I listen to them talk about their relationships, give advice when requested (because I somehow give excellent relationship advice, despite having never been in a relationship), and accept the fact that this is how it's always going to be for me. It's ok though. I have my own house, I have a pretty good job, and I have plenty of friends and a great family."
