You're still doing it.

Either they ""absolutely do not block viruses"" **OR** ""they assist in preventing the spreading of viruses.""

You can't claim both, because they're direct contradictions. 

There's not any contextual issues or word usage that makes these things not contradictions. You're just being a troll. (I hope. It's actually legitimately sad if you genuinely believe you're right)"
