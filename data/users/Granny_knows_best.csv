It was not one thing, it was everything.  Even as an adult and talking to a psychiatrist, I was not able to simplify what was wrong.     Now, 13 years later ( I developed SPD from a brain injury) I can pinpoint the cause and voice my displeasure in a way that those around me understand.

&#x200B;

  So maybe not ask what is wrong, but maybe help him remove himself from the problem.  Like if you are in a loud space, find a quiet corner.   Dont ask questions that he cant answer, maybe offer suggestions.  Let him talk, be patients and dont expect  the answer right way, let him voice himself, trial and error. Meaning, dont try to fix him, allow him to learn on his own the best way for him to help himself cope.  Takes patience, your frustrations will hinder his learning, step back and allow him to learn."
