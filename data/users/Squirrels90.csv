Parenting,ff377ez,t3_erehhx,1579535329.0,"I think you handled it perfectly, to be honest. The key might be to work on yourself to make this less stressful on you. 

You got the result you wanted and she learned her lesson for today. The frustrating part is that they learn the life lesson through many, many repetitions like today. I have a four year old too, it’s so challenging but I think you’re doing great!"
rarepuppers,ff36r48,t3_erekg5,1579535020.0,He looks so smug!
Awwducational,feli53y,t1_fef79dn,1579222732.0,"I have a calico girl and she is MOODY. I don’t know if it’s because she’s female or because that’s just her personality but she’ll cuddle one day and completely ignore us the next. 

She’s amazing with my kids though and so very patient. And she’s absolutely gorgeous."

cats,fdwraut,t1_fdswjss,1578761571.0,Can cats switch dominance roles? Because the girl cat is really the one in charge but he likes his food.
cats,fdsufro,t1_fdsu6lg,1578708082.0,"He isn’t protective at all, just rushes over to the girl and nudges her out of the way and she’s both baffled  and doesn’t care about her food much so she lets him.

Although I guess I should ask what does protective look like in cats? Both my dogs guard and it’s growling, hunching over the bowl, etc. Aggressive behavior if they think someone is taking their food."
cats,fdsu9pq,t1_fdsobe3,1578708022.0,"Yep, fully vetted and dewormed. I wonder if there’s a more filling food he may enjoy that isn’t higher calorie. Any ideas?"
cats,fdidh3u,t3_eljkqj,1578440417.0,"When he bites, turn away and refuse to play. Wait a few minutes and resume paying attention to him. Rinse and repeat a million times. 

It’ll show him that he needs to be more gentle."
toptalent,fda73ec,t3_ekf2sc,1578242506.0,"Is this the couple from America’s Got Talent? If so, the guy is also almost blind and works with his wife based on touch and choreography."
crochet,fd6ghnp,t3_ek67tv,1578190639.0,Maybe one of those plasticy loofahs?
cats,fd6ddt5,t1_fd5o5q0,1578189256.0,"Pick a date and just don’t let him out again. He’ll adjust. 

Think of it this way, he’s gaining safety, warmth, endless meals, lifelong happiness in exchange for not roaming the streets anymore."

Cleveland,fcv7e71,t1_fcv51pm,1577996185.0,Might find them on GrubHub or UberEats though!
cats,fcv1ji9,t1_fcukacr,1577992724.0,"Also neuter him if he isn’t already. If that’s your first order of business, he’ll be good."
cats,fcv1h7a,t1_fcukacr,1577992688.0,"I think given that he’s had so much time to acclimate to you and he knows you so well, he’ll adjust to the indoors just fine. That’s the only element that isn’t familiar already. 

If he starts marking, try those pheromone sprays. That will draw him to pee in only enticing and appropriate spots. Plenty of things to claw, yummy food all the time, and warmth 24/7 will acclimate him just fine. 

Tossing a wild outdoor cat Indoors doesn’t work well. Bringing in a cat that’s already adopted you seems like it should be smooth sailing."
cats,fcujedb,t3_ej081f,1577982350.0,"You’re like 98% of the way there with introducing them. Just bring him in and don’t let him out. Given all you’ve said, it sounds like he knows he’s yours already."
Parenting,fcjzr0o,t3_ehlu38,1577711951.0,"A breast pump if you intend to breastfeed and pump, but insurance should cover that (it you’re in the US). 

Nursing bras, also if going through bf route. 

A variety of bottles if you’re bottle feeding because sometimes kids just hate the kind of bottle you pick out. We went through 4 brands with my younger kid. 

Medelas are narrow, Avent are wide, TommyTippee look and feel like a boob, and there are a million other brands."
Parenting,fcjzmq0,t3_ehlu38,1577711820.0,"I’d recommend a decent crib and mattress, a nice stroller, a highly ranked car seat (not necessarily the most expensive), possibly a nice baby carrier if you’re into that (ex. Lillebaby, Kinderpack, Tula), a cool playmat for tummy time is nice but not essential, a playpen for when you need to set babe down in the living room. 

My absolutely favorite thing was a little vibrating reclined seat thing. I was able to take showers whenever I wanted provided the babies were fed and changed because I’d set them right in the bathroom with me and sing to them if there was fussing.  Seriously the best thing ever when you’re exhausted and going crazy...steaming hot shower. 

Some new clothes so you enjoy the shopping but also hand me downs if you can get them. Kids grow so fast and ruin everything anyway. Wait until they stop growing every hour to buy super cute stuff. 

Toys aren’t needed for the first few months but you may find your house covered in plastic junk anyway."
TooAfraidToAsk,fca0oa6,t3_eguhe4,1577561067.0,Moe’s is awful. Their food is stale and inedible. Chipotle is fresher and the chicken is delicious.
crochet,fc5gwz1,t3_egbqvu,1577457270.0,How about a removable full thumb? Do the whole thing but leave it unattached on the inner (palm) side so you can slip it out to text.
cats,fc4as68,t1_fc47kcu,1577411301.0,"I got cats to enjoy cats. Cats have claws, that’s how nature intended it."
cats,fc3not1,t1_fc3e95c,1577394077.0,"Agreed. We like our cats to be able to protect themselves. We have two large dogs and sometimes a punch to the snout is warranted. Plus with little kids, I’m always afraid one of the cats will bolt outside. 

Claws are essential."
cats,fc2tv20,t1_fc2th5r,1577373885.0,But I have heard the caps are great for cats who don’t get the message.
cats,fc2tu3r,t1_fc2th5r,1577373864.0,"We don’t have anything on them at all. Just ample toys for them to mess with and they don’t touch our furniture. Our girl started going after a chair that had a textured back and I redirected her. Every time she approached, I told her to leave it and put her in a different part of the room. 

Declawing is amputating their toe to the first knuckle. Many rescues will now ask you to sign paperwork saying you won’t declaw."
cats,fc2t9fi,t3_efwheu,1577373390.0,"They’re pretty self sufficient but here’s a list of good things to prepare:

- Multiple food dishes so you always have a clean one. Shallow ones are best to avoid whisker fatigue
- Cat tree for climbing and scratching
- Scratching post (our cats love to scratch but don’t touch our furniture at all because we have the posts for them to destroy)
- The cardboard scratchers (super cheap on Chewy.com) also for destruction and clawing but they feel different than the scratching post
- Random loose toys (also Chewy.com)
- Microchip appointment 
- A few litter boxes 

At first, only buy small bags of litter until you figure out which ones you like. We started with a giant bag of a popular brand and ended up hating the smell. The cats don’t really have a preference."
