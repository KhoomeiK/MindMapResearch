Well I happen to be 69. Computers were around in the 1980s, but they were quite expensive.  

I was an adult in the 80s and was employed full time and had 2 children. Computers were becoming very popular, but there was little in the way of games, and there were few ""services"" and almost nothing in the way of an ""internet"". There wasn't much an average person could use it for in practical terms. It was an exciting technology though and one could do things that seemed astounding at the time. (I remember the first time I saw a *huge* ""typewriter where the words you typed were displayed on a tiny screen and I was *amazed*.)

So getting a machine that would be basically a toy was a luxury when you have bills and not a lot of time to learn how to interface with the machine. Computers were not very user friendly. I remember the first time I used a mouse (after 1990) and how initially, it was hard to coordinate; it went all over the place and it too a minute to settle in!
The graphics were very primitive.

At my job, (in the 80s) computers were starting to show up, but they were used only with a specific program for financials. The appointment desk also used computers but with just one program. (Neither my spouse nor I used a computer at our jobs.)

I didn't know anyone who worked with computers as we know them today.  I wanted one, but there was really no need to learn how to work with them. No need to learn the concepts, the jargon, or the basics because there wasn't much I could have done with that knowledge.  Hard to picture now, but computers just weren't part of most adults lives.

My spouse now has been working with computers since the beginning (and even taught programming). He was very much the exception. He used early computers in the military, and they were laughably primitive even though they were cutting edge at the time. Most people had lived most of their lives without ever needing or using a computer. By the time they became more useful, user friendly and affordable, there was a steep learning curve and none of it was intuitive. Learning ""computer"" was like learning a new language and you know how hard that is when you're older.

When one eats a higher protein/fat meal, blood sugar rises moderately and then returns to normal. I'm not the kind of person who subscribes to strict diets.

There have been times and places when and where ""fat"" was attractive and a sign of both health and prosperity. After all, most diseases had no cures and having backup energy for your body was a big plus. 

Some people find fat attractive, good for them. Most people prefer a more normal weight, *not skinny*, just normal. Humans simply were not designed to have extra hundred(s) pounds to carry around. It stresses the body.

And lately, certain women who are around 50 years old have been getting a lot of attention, but the focus of their attractiveness tends to be their *bodies*, which are unusually fit for their age.

The Windsors make England more interesting and other countries (and US states) pay good money to promote their countries as interesting places to visit. The Royal Family is reliable PR.

Public relations specialists establish and maintain relationships with an organization's target audience, the media, relevant trade media, and other opinion leaders. Common responsibilities include designing communications campaigns, writing news releases and other content for news, working with the press, arranging interviews for company spokespeople, writing speeches for company leaders, acting as an organisation's spokesperson, preparing clients for press conferences, media interviews and speeches, writing website and social media content, managing company reputation (crisis management), managing internal communications, and marketing activities like brand awareness and event management[6] Success in the field of public relations requires a deep understanding of the interests and concerns of each of the company's many stakeholders. The public relations professional must know how to effectively address those concerns using the most powerful tool of the public relations trade, which is publicity.

Lol. Nevermind that a lot of very prominent royals (not all by any means) have been pretty rascally in the extreme.

Queen Elizabeth, her parents and grandparents have been pretty dutiful, overall. Phillip was good looking and aristocratic but his family was pretty broke. Phillip however served with distinction in the Mediterranean and Pacific Fleets during WW2. 

He and Elizabeth are related on both sides and had known each other for years (since she was about 8). Elizabeth became infatuated with him when she met him again at age 13 and they started a correspondence.

When she was 20 Phillip asked her father for her hand in marriage and he consented provided the wait till she was 21.

The Queen's sister was a total diva who didn't have a happy life. Various other siblings in the family had ""colorful"" lifestyles but little attention was paid to them.

Her father's brother (Edward the 8th) was the one who abdicated to marry the American divorcee after he was crowned King. He was a ""lightweight"", and a partier and a Nazi sympathizer and nobody liked his wife.

So he stepped down and Elizabeth's father (who was extremely shy and stuttered) became King. But he stepped up and became popular with the people, especially after WW2 during which the family became very involved in the war effort and refused to evacuate from London to the safety of the countryside.
