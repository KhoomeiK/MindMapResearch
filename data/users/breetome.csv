DOG,ffab5e6,t1_ffa6rm3,1579731454.0,"That's horrible!  It's just lazy not to train your dog.  I have a show dog that loves showing.  She gets so excited she literally vibrates.  I have to walk her around the show grounds half a dozen times to get her to mellow out.  It just sometimes takes time to let a dog settle.  I hate people that use things like this for normal behavior.  It's a dog, they get excited!"
dogs,ffa5yld,t1_ffa4r0n,1579728535.0,Not so much a brace but a harness that has a handle on top.  Check out the options at tripawds.com you may really need this as your dog ages.
DOG,ff9nvy6,t1_ff8ak44,1579716922.0,"I agree, have had to use one during field training.  It’s a tool not a way of life.  But should not be used by people to avoid basic training."
EntitledPeople,ff9nf4b,t1_ff8ikmi,1579716647.0,"No, that’s an outrageous price for any purebred dog.  Average is around $1,600.  Unless both parents have won at Westminster multiple times."
dogs,ff9n5nk,t3_es7tft,1579716489.0,"Have you tried a crate cover?  Close the door when feeding in the crate.  Keep her in there for a 15 minutes after eating.  Do not let her out if she whines.  Use high value treats getting her into crate.  Slowly increase the time she is in continue to feed treats through the wire.  If she is good open door and praise with a treat.  She’s still such a baby, these things take time."
dogs,ff9mmjl,t1_ff7m3tg,1579716175.0,"Your dog is gorgeous.  Looks like his weight is good, but hard to say under that amazing fur coat.  If you can take some weight off that can help.  Also I would fit him with a handle harness to help.  I second the Adequan injections.  They can really make a difference. I hope you have success treating him.  Lovely beastie."
aww,ff9lrpc,t3_esedjn,1579715669.0,Gorgeous Springer pup!
dogs,ff9kxlf,t1_ff7ycdg,1579715178.0,Have you tried breed specific rescues?  Also many breed clubs have rescue groups.  Also by contacting them you may run into a reputable breeder with puppies.  There’s nothing wrong with getting a well bred purebred dog or puppy.
dogs,ff9keo1,t1_ff97mc2,1579714869.0,Yes I always clean ears after every bath.  A great practice to get into.
dogs,ff9k8ax,t1_ff8w6jb,1579714764.0,"Yes use a dremel.  Faster and you can get a nice rounded nail.  I use the cordless, it’s much quieter.  Practice makes perfect with your pup. Lots of treats.  I teach my puppies by turning it on and just leave it running close by.  Then slowly touch them so they feel the vibrations.  Get them used to handling their paws.  A quick little touch on the nail, treats and gooooooood puppy!  When they are very young it’s ok to use the clippers just to take a sharp tip off.  Their nails are softer.  But teach them to accept the dremel on their nails.  Congratulations on your new puppy."
childfree,ff7hz7z,t1_ff7f3iu,1579649987.0,"Had the same happen to me!  I was 55 at the time, tubes tied, finishing off menopause, what more proof do you need?  I actually laughed in the nurses face.  Told her if I was pregnant I'd eat the x-ray machine....piece by piece.  Told me it was SOP, told her that I didn't care, no cup, no pee.  Move along."
AmItheAsshole,ff77x5w,t3_erygqf,1579642875.0,"YTA. And a miserable excuse for a father.  Oh boo hoo baby boy got 2 whole afternoons of detention, OMG he's gonna need therapy after that traumatic experience!!

 Your son is a total dirtbag but watch me buy his way out of this.  You should be ashamed of yourself and your son.  Now we know why your son is such a piece of shit, he learned it at your knee.  You're both pathetic.

I feel sorry for the poor girl who your son outed and your wife.  She has to live with the two of you assholes."
AmItheAsshole,ff776q9,t3_eryhti,1579642470.0,"YTA. Just because you ""pay"" for her schooling doesn't mean you are entitled to all the details of her personal life.  You're entitled to know that she is getting good grades, hasn't dropped out etc.  Her personal life is just that .....personal.  

She was right not to say anything considering the fact that here you are on Reddit whining to us about her not telling you she's seeing someone.  Don't you have your own life? Butt out mom."
AmItheAsshole,ff72pal,t3_erxd7g,1579639926.0,"NTA.  I called 911 last year for the same reason.  I was immediately asked what car make, color, license plate, my location etc.  ""An officer is currently being dispatched to your location"".  ""Can you maintain a safe distance and continue to keep them in your line of sight?"" ""Please stay on the phone with me and continue to provide directions so I can send them to the officer"".

That's how it's done.  Watched them get pulled over.  I pulled over behind the officer and told him I was the person who called.  He gave me his card thanked me and sent me on my merry way.  I do however live in the California wine country and summer weekends are a bunch of drunk idiot tourists driving through town."
dogs,ff679ft,t1_ff63tlu,1579620807.0,"Me too, I’m bringing in a 18 month old bitch into my house in 2 weeks.  My older bitch can be a bit standoffish.  I’m hoping for the best.  My big stud has always put himself in between the girls whenever things would get a bit tense.  He’s our peacekeeper.  Keeping my fingers crossed for a smooth introduction etc.  

In the past I’ve only had one bitch fight, my fault entirely.  I forgot to pick up a bone before opening crates.  It was over in seconds luckily.  Once again my boy jumped into the middle of the fray.  He’s an absolute treasure."

dogs,ff4m3zu,t3_erkq7n,1579566928.0,"Labs are wonderful all around dogs, no difference in colors.  Just don't go for the fad of a silver lab, they aren't bred responsibly.  Please find a reputable breeder and get yourself a wonderful puppy.  A lab and a farm just kind of go hand in hand.  Excellent choice!"
NatureIsFuckingLit,ff4gk19,t1_ff4c8d7,1579563085.0,"yup you're correct, no such thing as a white panther"
dogs,ff3cfz2,t1_ff31ft4,1579538396.0,"Thanks I have a dear friend who breeds flatties.  I should have been clearer, yes they are much narrower than goldens.  The golden that just won breed and group at the National dog show is a really big boy.  I prefer the bigger goldens.  I don’t really like seeing them getting smaller.  I’ve seen some spaniel size goldens at shows recently, didn’t float my boat so to speak."
dogs,ff3bxj7,t1_ff39v02,1579538137.0,Canine companions has been crossing labs and goldens for years now.  Apparently they are the perfect cross for service dogs.  People around here sit on waiting lists forever to pick up the dogs that don’t make it all the way.  I have a friend who is a puppy raiser for them and another who breeds litters for them.  They are amazing smart sweet dogs.  That’s probably why this vet is breeding this cross.
dogs,ff2z4d8,t1_ff2y0hh,1579529222.0,Are you sure it’s not a flat coat retriever?  They are black and look like a small golden.
dogs,fezwafs,t1_fezf82z,1579462486.0,Clean is overrated lol!
Equestrian,fezw00m,t1_feze5ei,1579462380.0,Yes part of advancing is riding more difficult horses.  But difficult and dangerous are two very different things.  Any horse that rears is dangerous period.  I would ask your trainer to hop on and show you how to deal with this issue.  I’d be interested to see if this horse pulls the same crap with them.
dogs,fezdyiu,t1_fezaxhe,1579456361.0,This!  I hate not having a dog in my house.  It’s just a thing with some of us.  I love having dogs.  I’ve even borrowed a dog from my breeder until she had a puppy for me.  Life is boring without a furry terrorist in the house.
Equestrian,fezdedi,t1_fezc0gw,1579456189.0,Lol! Mine used to come out of the wash rack go into his stall......pee.....then roll in it.  Big freaking idiot.  Back to the wash rack......just kill me.
Equestrian,fezd6g5,t3_eqzepy,1579456108.0,Pretty mare!
Equestrian,fezd070,t1_fezaf4p,1579456048.0,"That’s insane dangerous.  I would never get on a horse known for bucking, rearing etc.  your trainers are out of their minds.  I would find a new trainer with proper school horses.  Any trainer who puts you on a horse like that is just looking for a big fat lawsuit.  What happens when that mare rears and goes over on you?  Could be killed or end up in a wheelchair for life.  Move to a new stable yesterday!!  Please OP refuse to ride that mare please!! Or we’re going to be seeing you over in legal advice soon.  If you don’t end up with a traumatic brain injury."
dogs,fezbduo,t1_fez7jy4,1579455661.0,"Probably, it grinds my gears when I see stuff like that.  I’m sure the OP will give this boy a wonderful new home."
dogs,fez36tj,t1_feyz1hc,1579453465.0,"The breeder is an idiot for using a dog that young as a breeding stud...and now it’s retiring?!  But you’re right about the name change, no big deal."
dogs,ferwp2o,t1_fergte0,1579359088.0,"I’m a huge fan of the sporting group breeds.  Setters, pointers, retrievers.  They are smart, loving but enjoy sofa time once they mature.  Love the outdoors and all have built in 4 wheel drive.  Make excellent companion dogs.  Lots of different options, long hair, short hair and a variety of sizes to choose from.  

If you’re in the US check out infodog.com for upcoming shows in your area.  Go look over the different breeds and ask questions.  Hopefully you find your new best friend!"
DOG,ferr9vi,t3_eqbnda,1579357441.0,Incoming!!!
NatureIsFuckingLit,fermc4d,t1_fep40n8,1579355721.0,True but he has the muscle due to conditioning.  He would blow out a multitude of ligaments if he wasn’t.  Love your analogy!  He da man!
NatureIsFuckingLit,feoxjyn,t1_feolpok,1579307558.0,"Doubt it, this looks to be a stallion.  The last thing they would want is to hurt his ability to pass on his genes.  You really don’t see steroid use in the equine community.  This guy is all about the next generation.  The muscle is from conditioning."
AmItheAsshole,feljv59,t3_epo8qi,1579223925.0,"You realize this is like the 10th time this has been adapted to film?  You could have watched any number of adaptations at any time.  If it was so important to you I would think you would have watched one of the earlier adaptations .  YTA, who doesn't speak to their SO because of a movie? You sound terribly dramatic."
dogs,fel1kep,t3_eppnws,1579212066.0,She will probably grow out of them.  But I agree with TWZL below.  Talk to your breeder and see what they think.
DOG,fel134j,t3_eppx56,1579211781.0,Yes that much can change in a puppy that young.  Especially without all the vaccinations on board.  The vet isn't just ripping you off.  They are trained to notice things that you wouldn't see.  It's very easy for young puppies to become ill when they haven't had all their shots.  It can happen quite quickly and can be deadly.  Your vet is just being thorough .  After the shots are all on board you probably won't see you vet again until it's time for vaccination booster such as rabies.
aww,fehqfj5,t1_fehpr7v,1579121816.0,"You got lucky!  It's not BS it's proven animal science.  I'm glad you didn't run into the problems that thousands of others have.  This is a real issue that can cause serious behavioral problems.  You dodged a bullet. 

Nope it doesn't all come down to the owner.  Wow quite the ego you have there."
aww,fehpjn5,t3_ep75rf,1579121305.0,Please google littermate syndrome.  You're going to have your hands full here.
aww,fehosxi,t1_fehgesc,1579120876.0,No it's not normal.  6 weeks is terribly young to remove a pup from mama and siblings.  8 weeks should be the bare minimum.  10 weeks is even better.
DOG,feh0swq,t1_fefrmze,1579106757.0,Not a purebred beagle.  Looks like a pug beagle cross.

AmItheAsshole,feet2ws,t3_eoq0fz,1579040616.0,"After reading many of the responses I tend to agree you're the asshole.  Boomer here! We got new neighbors will 2 young boys.  During their first summer here the boys would be out back until 11 at night laughing, screaming and playing loudly.  Unless I closed all my windows (which I shouldn't have to do) we would be woken up constantly. 

After some time I asked them to please keep the noise down after 9:00.  Not unreasonable at all.  Guess what, they spoke to their children and had them play inside after 9.  That's how you deal with it.

The boys are older (9 and 11) now and play in front with their friends all the time, basketball, etc.  Yes I can hear them from the back of my house with the windows closed.  However during the day I don't care if they scream down the whole street.  However after dark we would like some peace and quiet. 

Your obvious disdain for boomers is off-putting to say the least.  I'm glad I have reasonable neighbors and not some self important millennials next door with stinky chickens and loud children. Oh and the whole woe is me we work so hard story is falling on deaf ears.  Some self realization that other folks have worked as hard or harder than you would do you some good.  YTA actually YTSIA, you're the self important asshole."

Equestrian,fecnmvj,t3_eogif1,1578978459.0,"Before you put down any money please have a complete pre purchase exam done by a vet.  Not your trainers vet, a different vet.  The horse may or may not be worth the price your trainer is asking.   You can start the conversation with your trainer to the effect of.  ‘After Dobbin clears a vet check I would like to discuss purchasing him’.  If trainer won’t let you do a vet check look for a horse elsewhere.  Have her state in writing what the horses full purchase price will be.  His age, breed information, any known faults, any medication he’s on.  

I’ve seen too many first time buyers get taken advantage of.  Cover all your bases."
dogs,fecmyv5,t3_eogf85,1578977939.0,You should be able to call your vet and ask for free.
AmItheAsshole,feblv6z,t3_eobujo,1578960150.0,"NTA.  If I was that breeder I would blacklist those folks with every other breeder I know.  They gave up their dog, breeder placed dog with you legally.  You have nothing to feel bad about.  Buddy is your dog now period.

Have you told the breeder that these folks have contacted you to get the dog back?  If not please let the breeder know.  I'm sure they will have some choice words for them."

I wheel the bags and he brings up the rear with the golf clubs.  Marriage is a partnership.  She needs to pull her own weight, especially if she wants to pack like she's leaving the country for 6 months.  

When you say carry, does that mean you don't have wheels on your suitcases?  If not, well there's her Christmas present for this year."
dogs,feagklf,t1_fea1f3g,1578948508.0,"Somewhere out there is a special hook up for your backpack to secure a larger dog to in case of injury.  I've seen it, just not sure where to find it or what it's called.  This might be a good thing for you to have with you when hiking with a big dog."
dogs,feagfb4,t1_fe9sgka,1578948435.0,"Yes this!  They grow so darn fast, it's wonderful to be able to pick them up when they're young.  My boy is 96 pounds, there is no way I can pick him up.  Still thinks he's a lap puppy though."
dogs,fe96mdv,t1_fe8ocms,1578934850.0,"Both males?  While training them you can keep them in belly bands when inside to keep them from marking.  It will be beneficial so they don’t have the smell of marking in your house.  Change the bands when they get wet, they are washable.  Get quite a few, they’re fairly inexpensive."
dogs,fe95x63,t1_fe8t86i,1578934613.0,"If they can’t find bitter apple, fill a spray bottle with half White distilled vinegar and half water.  Spray little horny boy in the face.  It won’t hurt him just mess up his sense of smell temporarily.  It’s a great deterrent.  If little boy connects with your girl don’t attempt to separate them, it could hurt both of them seriously.  You will just have to wait until they are done and you will probably have a pregnancy."
dogs,fe8t7jx,t3_eo2i2o,1578930561.0,"You need to keep watch on quality of life.  Yes older dogs slow down and can get hearing and eyesight issues.  Painful joints etc.  geez sounds like I’m describing myself lol!  They can also develop a form of canine dementia.  

As long as you are managing pain issues with your vet and dog is eating regularly you’re ok.  When you start noticing lack of appetite is when you should have your vet re-evaluate your dogs condition.  If you notice excessive panting or shaking you may have a pain management problem.  

Vision loss and hearing problems can be managed.  My older girl became quite deaf, we would be careful not to sneak up on her when sleeping.  I would stomp my foot near her so she would feel the vibration and wake up.  Vision issues involve not rearranging your furniture.  Blind or visually impaired dogs can do just fine.  

Just watch your dog closely for signs that they are starting to have serious trouble managing daily life.  It’s hard and heartbreaking to have to make the choice to euthanize your dog.  Just remember it’s our responsibility to transfer their physical pain to our hearts when we let them go."
dogs,fe8qxxa,t1_fe671qn,1578929581.0,Ahhhhh you’re so sweet to give me a shout out!  Your little Cedar (yeah little lol!) is getting an amazing home!  I’m so looking forward to watching your baby grow up.

We tried everything, no go for her.  She would sleep inside at night but daytime she wanted out period."
AmItheAsshole,fe5c8do,t3_enriuc,1578867605.0,"NTA at all.  Your cat your rules.  I took in a semi feral cat years back.  Tried everything just like you to keep her inside.  She literally would shred the window screens and escape.  I spent a fortune replacing those.  I couldn't live in a house and never open a window up.  So she would come sleep inside at night and cruise during the day.  

Your neighbor is a psycho entitled bitch.  It's not her cat, not her daughter's cat.  I would take the flea collar and put it on her porch with the new collar."
dogs,fe56xab,t1_fe4c3a3,1578866170.0,"I would pass on the comforter, just a big chew toy.  She would be find with puppy toys and dog beds.  I like that you can watch her during the day.  I would try to get a friend to come by if possible for potty time and play time.

Puppies won't sleep through the night until they are much older.  They will wake up and need to potty.  Which normally involves whining until someone takes them out.  Or just waking up and whining because they're little silly puppies that get scared or lonely. 

It's going to be very hard to potty train this puppy so please be patient with her.  Which I'm sure you will be.  

p.s. my dogs prefer Jazz on the radio lol!"
dogs,fe53i39,t1_fe48agk,1578865342.0,"Huskies aren't in the sporting group.  I've had setters and retrievers my entire life and haven't found them demanding so to speak.  They are snuggle bugs and love spending time with their owners.  Many of the sporting group breeds are just as happy spending time on the sofa as they are out running around.  They don't tend to have that go go go personality of a husky.  

I would say that pointers tend to be more independent.  I have never owned one but I have friends that breed and show them and tell me this.  The English Springer Spaniel is a medium sized dog that is a rollicking breed.  Not as large as others in the group.  Are you in the U.S.?  If so you can go to infodog.com and find upcoming dog shows in your area.  It's fun to go to a show and meet the different breeds.  Folks who breed and show love talking about our dogs.  Just hunt them down at their grooming set ups.  Outside the ring everyone is very focused on showing and on a tight timeline.  Hit them up when they're relaxed back at their set ups."

You should not bring a puppy home to that.  Puppy will probably end up covered in feces etc.  you don’t want puppy to ever eliminate in its crate.  This is a critical time when puppy comes to a new home.  Being abandoned immediately for almost 10 hours is cruelty. Please rethink when you get this puppy.

Please make an appointment and keep your pup crated or confined until your appointment to avoid further damage.  Hopefully it's nothing serious but you need a vet to tell you what's up."
dogs,fdxvk91,t1_fdxkddi,1578773381.0,"I use my coat king right after a bath too.  Dog is already wet kill two birds with one stone.  You can also use a canine lanolin & conditioner mixture on your dogs coat to help with matting.  Get a large spray bottle, mix in 1 ounce each of lanolin and conditioner, fill with hot water, shake and spray on your dog.  Brush through with a bristle brush.  It helps keep the coat less matted.  You don't need a lot on a shorter coat dog such as yours.  It really won't leave your dog oily unless you pour it on. You can find the products on Amazon."
dogs,fdxh1v9,t1_fdx2bji,1578768633.0,"Well you could try a MARS coat king.  This will strip the undercoat out.  You can find them at petedge.com, just make sure you get the right one for her coat type.  I recommend spraying the fur to dampen it first so the hair doesn't tear.  You work in the direction of the growth of the coat.   Also a slicker brush used gently can help keep mats out."

Firefighters from all over the world and the country showed up to help us.  Even Australia, I'm glad we can return the favor. 

In 2017 the firefighters had a huge camp set up at our local fairgrounds.  Every chef, caterer and talented cook for miles lined up to cook gourmet meals for them.  Every time they were out in public doing anything they would be cheered non stop by all the locals.  Their money was no good in our local towns.  Every firefighter was treated to meals, drinks, etc.  Some of the local breweries had 'Buy a firefighter a beer' you could buy beers for them when they would come in after their shifts.

I have large breed dogs and a smaller SUV.  It was the only one that fit.  Now I’m picking up a new 18 month old pup.  I have to pull out my old filthy airline crate, clean it etc.  it’s packed full of extra bedding and show crap.  Did I mention grrrrrrrrrrrrr?! 

Hope your puppy is doing better now."

dogs,fdkm7xv,t1_fdkl2wz,1578506457.0,"I'm so sorry you had to deal with that.  How heartbreaking.  You should be able to successfully potty train a pup with that schedule.  I would set pup up with a crate inside a puppy pen with potty pads. This way pup gets used to the crate and can't get into trouble.  But can still stretch it's legs in the pen.  

Get a couple small hanging water buckets for the pen.  A bowl will get tipped over.  I would take a look at the sub puppy101 for tips on training, feeding etc.  There is some great information over there.

You had some very bad luck and I'm horribly sorry about what you went through.  That had to have been quite difficult.  Don't worry about your new puppy getting sick.  Just make sure your vaccination schedule is kept up with your vet and don't take pup out to areas that are frequented by other dogs until all shots are on board.  

Sounds like you have a good support system in place to help with the baby.  Have your helpers come inside and immediately carry puppy outside to potty, teaching the 'potty' command.  Once puppy does it's business they carry it back inside for play time!  

If your breeder is truly a reputable one you shouldn't have any problems like you did before."
dogs,fdkj5z2,t3_elvlmk,1578504833.0,"What breed are you looking at?  do you have time to stay home with the puppy when it first comes home?  How long are you planning on leaving it alone during the day.  What age is the puppy you are planning on getting?

A reputable breeder will have some health guarantees in their contract.  You need to research the breed and find if genetic issues are a problem with the breed.  Also money as others have mentioned.  You can always get pet insurance on your puppy.

What problems did your other puppy have health wise? Sorry you lost a pup, it's sad."
AmItheAsshole,fdkhmgh,t3_eltot6,1578504050.0,"NTA, this is just plain animal abuse on behalf of the owner.  I have drop coated dogs and I brush and comb them constantly to keep the mats out of their coats.  This owner is absolutely an idiot.  You did the right thing for this poor little dog.  The coat will come back in just fine.  You did what you needed to do to help an animal in distress.  You get hero status from me!!!!"

funny,fdduimv,t1_fddsjp7,1578324306.0,"Yes you’re correct despite people downvoting you.  Folks need to think ahead.  What if doggy gets ill and has to be crated at the vets office.  If your dog is comfortable being crated it can help with recovery.  If the dog is stressed being crated it can cause trouble.  

We had to evacuate twice in the last 3 years because of fires.  It was nice that my 3 were comfortable being crated.  I saw many dogs tearing at their crates.  Had they been crate trained the time would have been easier on them. Mine just quietly slept in their crates.  You never know what the future brings.  Be prepared and crate train dogs."

dogs,fdavv5j,t1_fd9bqei,1578250915.0,"A reputable breeder will have tested their lines for genetic issues.  However this isn’t a guarantee your dog won’t at some time in its life become ill.  Feeding, environment and good health care will play into this.  You’re going to be ahead of the game by getting a puppy from a reputable breeder.  Golden retriever is an excellent breed.  Loving, smart and always ready for an adventure.  Just lots of shedding, all the time. 365 days a year.  But they’re worth it!"
dogs,fdaue7k,t1_fd92ezr,1578250297.0,"That’s a good start.  Remember until puppy has it’s vaccinations finished keep him away from areas where other dogs are.  6 weeks is extremely young, puppy has no protection from disease and it’s immune system isn’t strong.  You really need to consult your vet about this puppy."

Putting a dog to sleep is normally a very quiet and peaceful ending for a dog.  But I’m not sure the kids need to see the big needle being inserted etc.  it can be traumatic to watch.  I’m 62 and it tore my heart out.  Heck I didn’t want to see it but I did what was ,right for my girl.  Their presence could stress your dog out."

If you’re paying in the hundreds you’re getting a backyard bred dog.  Reputable breeders put too much time and money into their litters to sell them cheaply.  You’re getting what you pay for.  Health testing, genetic screening, OFA testing and results.  Contracts guaranteed health on and on.  Please reconsider how much you need to spend to get a healthy quality puppy."
