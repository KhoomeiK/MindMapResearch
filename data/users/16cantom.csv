PennStateUniversity,fffaoij,t1_fff3d93,1579879782.0,I couldn't agree more. My freshman year I either walked or biked but there was no way in hell I was riding the bus. Even now as a senior I still refuse to take the bus even when it's on the opposite side of campus
PennStateUniversity,fdrgrjb,t3_emu2tp,1578684302.0,"Hello friend. Apologies for the awful formatting, I'm typing this on mobile. It appears given the top link below, the world campus students attend the commencement along with us at University Park. The second link shows the schedule and given you're a business major, your commencement should be on May 9th at 9:00 AM in the BJC. Have a great last semester, maybe I'll see you on the 9th. I graduate at 1:00 PM that day!

PennStateUniversity,fdkf1iq,t1_fdk4gn9,1578502493.0,"I lived in East supplemental (Tener hall) in 2016 during my freshman year before the renovations improved the building and it was just fine. It gets a bit hot if you do happen to get put in a non-renovated building but you are there for so little time where it's unbearably hot that it really doesn't matter. Get a decent fan and you'll be just fine. If you are fortunate enough to get a renovated building you'll basically be living in a hotel. Regardless, I promise you'll be just fine.

It may make me sound a bit old here but it's worth living somewhere kind of shitty freshman year as it makes you appreciate the next year's even more. It's part of the freshman experience. Good luck and welcome to State!"
dogpictures,fdke84z,t1_fdke65b,1578501998.0,"You're awesome! I'll definitely try to pick some up soon, thank you!"
dogpictures,fdke66h,t1_fdkczeu,1578501966.0,That's a great idea! I've actually never heard of using a moose antler but it sounds like it would work very well. He's still a bit small since he's young so carrying around something too big proves difficult (though it is cute to watch) but I'll make sure to check it out! Thank you again!
dogpictures,fdka8vo,t1_fdk5s3m,1578499587.0,"Cow hooves sound great, we use bully sticks and he LOVES them to the same degree. The paper idea is awesome too, love that. Thank you too! Give your pup some pets for us!!"
dogpictures,fdka4zp,t1_fdjo5ll,1578499518.0,"We aren't quite sure. His litter was a total mix of dogs, some of which looked like little boxers or labs. We think he is some sort of boxer/Shepherd mix as it's the closest we've seen to his coloring, ears, and face. My mom actually was given a DNA test for him by a co-worker so we hope to find out soon! Thank you!!"
dogpictures,fdk9z3x,t1_fdjw9xk,1578499413.0,Thank you and will do!! Give your pup some pets for me too!
dogpictures,fdk9wtk,t1_fdk2nwm,1578499373.0,"Haha yes, the baby teeth that are small razors too! He really enjoys bully sticks and stuffed toys which he has plenty of. The fire hose material toys that make a ""crackle"" sound also seem to be of interest when he needs to chew."
dogpictures,fdk9rxh,t1_fdjuz3d,1578499287.0,Thank you for the suggestion! I've never heard of it but we'll have to try it out.
dogpictures,fdj96mj,t1_fdj8v7s,1578462083.0,Thank you!!
dogpictures,fdj0kbg,t1_fdj0939,1578455378.0,"Thank you!! We couldn't love him more than we do, even though he's bad sometimes!"
dogpictures,fdj0hna,t1_fdizxgd,1578455327.0,Haha!! Very funny. Wish you and your family the best!
dogpictures,fdiyus2,t1_fdiyoii,1578454201.0,"Haha glad to hear someone is in the same shoes (ha ha)! My brother is actually 8 years younger so I remember very well him being a baby and toddler, puppyhood seems to not be much different! We have found the ""bully sticks"" to be a great distraction between watching him attack his toys and us."
puppies,fdixy8w,t1_fdisc2x,1578453586.0,"Not sure what breed. He's from a litter of unknown parents apparently to the adoption service we got him from. We did get a DNA test we hope to use soon but as of now we believe he's a boxer, Shepherd, potentially lab mix of some type! Thank you for the kind words too. We can't get enough of him."
puppies,fdixv5t,t1_fdiulkb,1578453527.0,Hahaha. Love it!
dogpictures,fdixsjg,t1_fdixd8a,1578453477.0,You better bet we have tons of toys for him to bite. We learned the distraction technique on the first day of having him. Hopefully he will be the same as your dog soon and will only play with toys (though I'll admit his biting is kind of cute).
dogpictures,fdiw96x,t3_elizjs,1578452463.0,"This is our little pup Odin. My brother and I have been begging for a dog for as long as I can remember. As Thanksgiving was approaching this year I got a call from my brother telling me that mom and dad had said we could get a dog! As I'm currently away in college, I jumped on the computer and immediately started looking in my home town for puppies up for adoption. While my parents said they didn't want a puppy, I sent my mom a picture of one of the puppies at Odin's shelter and she was convinced instantly and called to schedule a visit.

When the day came, my parents and brother went to the adoption center and video called me so I could see the puppies too. When they got there, they were informed the puppy we had seen before was a mistake and had actually been adopted months earlier. While they were a bit sad at first, a new litter of puppies had just come in from Tennessee as they were discovered alongside their mom who had sadly passed. Immediately our little guy Odin ran up to my mom and jumped up on her and when she picked him up he nuzzled right into her neck. He did the same to my brother and dad and we knew it was meant to be so we applied to adopt him.

That weekend I made the trip home from college and we went to go pick up our new puppy. I couldn't have been more happy and cried once I saw him. At the time he was only 8 weeks old and was a chubby little pup. We took him home after filling out the paperwork and getting him his bed, treats, food, etc. And immediately couldn't get enough of him.

He's now about 16 weeks old and gained just around 12 lbs since we got him. He's a bit of a biter as all puppies are but absolutely LOVES people and animals of all ages. When we take him for walks he'll strangle himself on the leash just to get to a little kid or other dog. He's definitely an alpha dog in some situations but is not aggressive under any circumstances. We're working on training him with a trainer he's known since arriving in our State. As with many rescues we have no idea what breed or mix he is but we think definitely some boxer and Shepherd in there, this just makes us love him more! We can't wait for him to be fully grown and take him camping and on all types of adventures!!

Edit: Added some more details. Note this is from my other post in r/aww"
dogpictures,fdiw3yp,t1_fdiuxb3,1578452368.0,"Thank you for your kind words and advice. His chewing and biting is nothing we haven't expected and all in all he's an amazing dog. I will say I don't use my camera nearly as much as I'd like but my brother is younger and loves taking pictures and videos so we are very fortunate! His growth has been amazing to watch. Also as I type this he just ran away with a shoe I accidentally left out, here we go again!"
dogpictures,fdit990,t1_fdioojr,1578450530.0,"You better bet I can! Gonna have to have my brother help too. He's home more than I am due to college so he has most of the 2,000 pics we have! I'll try to make an imugr dump tonight"
dogpictures,fdit6fe,t1_fdii5aa,1578450483.0,Thank you! He's irresistible. Even when he's bad he's too cute to yell at haha
dogpictures,fdit4vt,t1_fdiir31,1578450456.0,Thank you!! We can't get enough of his cuteness either!
