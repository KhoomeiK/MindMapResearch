I actually found [old article in Czech](http://babavanga.euweb.cz/), its a nice time capsule of predictions(paraphrased translation):

2008 - Attempted assassinations of 4 world leaders. Conflict in South East Asia, one of the causes of WW3.

2010 - WW3 begins in September. WW3 ends October 2014. War starts with conventional weapons but later nuclear and chemical weapons are used.

2011 - Due to nuclear fallout in northern Hemisphere plants and animals were left to their own devices. Later, Muslims wage war against Europe using chemical weapons.

2014 - Most people suffer from skin cancer and skin issues as a result of chemical warfare

2016 - Europe is almost desolate

2018 - New China becomes a world superpower. Developing countries again controlled by colonizers

2020 - All of North and South America is integrated into Holy British Empire.

Surprisingly, no mention of Putin assassination in 2020 or Trumps disease."
fatlogic,feh9da7,t3_ep2rum,1579111860.0,"I agree with pretty much everything said to a point, but this opinion is missing literally any semblance of nuance.

I agree. People shouldnt be assholes. I agree, EDs are an issue. There might be certain bias in medicine. I agree, its none of your business what people do to their bodies. I agree, a lot of ads focus on undermining peoples self esteem to sell supplements and memberships. I agree, there might be things outside of ones control(hormones, medication, living in food desert, bad eating habits from parents) that might be almost impossible to get over. And people generally do better and stick to positive changes better if they are in supportive environment and shaming doesnt really work. 

And I think FA/body positivity could have been great movements for people with EDs or low self-esteem.

The problem is that it got coopted, and they overcorrected harms done by ""diet industry"" by going absolutely totally bonkers. There is no nuance.

Lets take doctors as an example... what is alternative to a system with bias against fat people? More hours spent in medical school talking about biases and examinations of fat people? NOPE, literally ban doctors from speaking about weight being an issue. Prescribe diabetes and hypertension medication left and right and NEVER try to actually tackle what might be the primary cause.

atheism,feh4llq,t3_ep1lq0,1579109028.0,"There is literally no major modern religion(or nonreligion) where organ donation doesnt make sense. Under no non-fundamentalist religious framework can one conclude that organ donation is wrong.

From my experience, most people that were opposed to organ donation(or ""rotting and worms eating me"", ""Being burned"", ""being butchered by medical students"", etc.) are just people that never faced mortality. The thought of their own death, even with afterlife, but ""passing to heaven in non-physical form"" just causes such an emotional distress that they will believe literally anything to not think about their organs being removed.

And these opinions were always visceral, physical, bodily reaction, not something rational... the ""guys can you please stop talking about cremation it makes me upset"" kind of opinions.

Also, I have once talked to a (presumably) non-religious dude and he told me he wont be donating his organs because ""Its his body""(cant argue with bodily autonomy) and because ""I will be helping planet by giving my body back""(I wont even start how idiotic this stance is), so this is not really a religious issue, more of a *unhealthy culture of death in western cultures* issue."

Ohovaranie, vyhrazanie sa, vyclenenie zo spolocnosti, doxxing, urazanie. Na tychto sa zhodne vacsina ludi. Pre mna osobne je nasilie aj dehumanizacia(napr. nazyvanie ludi parazitmi), alebo pouzivanie emocnej retoriky(napr. ""Ved pockaj kym sem prijdu, znasilnia ci dceru a zabiju synov!""), hlavne ak su zamerane na veci ako je rasa, etnikum, sexualna orientacia, apod. lebo si myslim ze tieto veci vytvaraju prostredie ""suhlasu s diskriminaciou a nasilim"".

Definovat nasilie ako cisto fyzicke nasilie je dost uzkoprse, vacsina filozofov a lingvistov sa zhodne na tom ze nasilie je nieco na styl: ""[Akekolvek chovanie ktore nuti ineho cloveka rozhodovat sa proti svojej voli a presvedceniu](https://sk.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A1silie#Defin%C3%ADcia_n%C3%A1silia)"".

I get that a lot of people that lost faith go through ""Angsty teenage atheist"" phase where they have feeling they have to prove themselves, but really, its not needed and is actively detrimental to your well being. It doesnt impact anything, you probably wont change their minds, and its something so personal that they can get offended and make your life hell.

If you live with your parents: DONT TELL THEM.

If you are dependent on them for insurance or money: DONT TELL THEM.

When you expect they will disown you: DONT TELL THEM.

When you want to have good relationship with them, and them not knowing is not against your opinions(e.g. they force you to go to pro-life protests): DONT TELL THEM.

Its not like you are lying on your own volition, you are forced to lie. Just dont tell them. Your atheism has almost no impact on their opinions, you are just stirring shit when you dont need to.

Only reason why you should tell your parents is that if they are super open minded, want to nudge their political opinions in other direction and/or that you have deep understanding with your parents and you just feel you have to tell them.

I know its not a full meal, but I feel they dont get enough love. You can sprout lentils, mungo, nuts, seeds. Not even on Vegan sites/subs even though Vegans are ones that would benefit the most.

In addition to being cheap as hell, sprouting also removes anti-nutrients from legumes, increases bio-availability of nutrients and stuff like mungo is very high in B9.

I made about a pound of sprouts(about 12inch pot filled to the brim, enough for 3 days of stir fry) with half a cup of mungo beans.

And you need strainer(pasta strainer preferably, sprouts grow into the fine-mesh ones and are PitA to take out), container for soaking and clean towel. There is usually a soaking period(8-24h) followed by sprouting for a few days(keeping towel wet over strainer filled with pre-soaked beans/sprouts and rinsing the sprouts every 24h). Times vary for different legumes/grains, so Google. Or you can get one of the kits or bags made for this purpose.

Stir fry, use them in salads or pickle them."
