xxketo,fe5ax8n,t3_enrbpq,1578867183.0,"Same thing is happening for me sister! Except now I'm paranoid I'm doing something wrong. I'm not hitting my calorie goal everyday  (because I'm not hungry) so now I'm paranoid that my body is in starvation mode and is holding onto everything that I'm eating! Guess we've just got to keep going and eventually Regina and Rupert will give us the goods.

In support of us I've decided to name my scales Rupert!"
keto,fdg00l0,t3_el0ajn,1578375156.0,Same thing happened to me. Started in early 2019 and in June 2019 had a 'cheat meal' for my partners birthday. A cheat meal that lasted 7 months!!! Everything went to shit but I'm also back now. Congratulations on coming back - it takes a lot of courage! You got this!
CasualConversation,fdf388a,t3_ekv8fu,1578352288.0,"I've no comment regarding your will, but I just wanted to send well wishes from SA. Sending you so much love and thanks. Be safe - the videos are terrifying."
bipolar,fc3wbil,t3_efpj89,1577400291.0,I had a total mental break then! Of course that's what ECT means. *palm in face!* Thanks for commenting!
bipolar,fc3usip,t3_efy4bv,1577399171.0,I know exactly how you feel! I'm currently looking for a job and the anxiety I feel is off the charts! My partner is understanding but he's never been fired from a job. So he doesn't understand the deep shame I have.

bipolar,fc2gle7,t1_fc215vq,1577359074.0,"I think I was very naive to think I could have a drug free pregnancy. I've been stable for so long, that I kind of forgot what it was like until I got reduced so I think I'll definitely be taking some form of medication.

It's still ages away, but thinking about it makes me so anxious. I've already started to preplan and I'm lucky to have supportive family and friends so that will help during and after.

I'll check out the meds you suggested. Thankyou so much for replying to me ðŸ˜Š"
bipolar,fc2geqo,t1_fc255fd,1577358772.0,Thankyou for this! I'll definitely look into it as I've never heard of ECT.
Weddingsunder10k,fc1q7ok,t3_efhc5w,1577326255.0,That is a stunning ring! Congratulations ðŸ˜Š
JUSTNOMIL,fbtxbqo,t3_eebut5,1577100818.0,"Well done on focusing on yourselves this year! Stay strong and don't give in! You just had surgery, not to mention all the emotional stuff ontop.

Regarding baby talk, a few simple responses should shut her down:
""If you are you so keen on a baby MIL, when are you going to start trying?""

""We are currently happy with our life""

""We prefer our babies have  <insert description about animals> (four legs, scales, wings etc)

""How do you know we aren't trying?""

Or my personal favourites: 
""Why are you so interested in our sex life?""

""What positions do you recommend? DH thinks missionary is what we need to do, but I feel like reverse cowgirl is where it's at."""
