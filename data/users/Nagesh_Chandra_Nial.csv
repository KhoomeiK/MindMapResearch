JordanPeterson,fey2kum,t1_fexylh7,1579439902.0,"I definitely believe that porn is different than prostitution to some degree. I don't believe in the game, as it is upto the player to player to play it the way he wants to play it and if people judge the player then you should question the people. I suggest you take a brief rest and stop pursuing women and dedicate a significant amount of time for yourself. Just take a break to be selfish and focus on what you can achieve without people for people."
JordanPeterson,fexwvqx,t1_fexw2dx,1579437770.0,"I am not attacking you, if women are looking forward to you as a provider then try to provide them and whether you can provide or don't want to is a different question. If you couldn't provide then you might be at fault but if you don't want to then why care. Porn is definitely not like prostitution because they don't have ""sex"" in porn, it's different, it's work for them, they're actors. It's like wrestling. They take anywhere from 3 to half a day to shoot a scene with a lot of complications and restrictions."
JordanPeterson,fexuxch,t1_fextxt8,1579436888.0,"It's not about choosing to be celibate but seeing sex as more important than changing yourself. Even when you're taking the services of a working girl, you're eliminating the the journey. Seriously ask yourself, have you ever asked those women about why they aren't interested in you. Sex is for reproduction and recreation and when it comes to recreation, there are a lot of other ways. You could definitely be better than what you are now through, minimal grooming, gym three times a day, reading a  book a week, maintaing proper hygiene, doing good at your career. I don't look good or let's just say, women wouldn't want to be around me, they all hate me but I have a good personality which I built throughout the years, my personality makes me attractive and interesting, I can pursue women for sex or for relationship but I condemn that sort of pursuit and sex as a form of recreation is not that important for me."
JordanPeterson,fextqlu,t1_fext8a0,1579435982.0,"No porn is definitely responsible for mental health issues, that's why lot of people are on nofap. It's like any other drug, it reduces the journey to pleasure and instantaneously gives you pleasure and porn and masturbation is definitely not a substitute for sex, as it involves a lot of factors including a journey. Don't be sceptical of research, be the research if you can but I'd rather you not because it's really gruelling. We're talking about an amount that is well past moderation, which even goes for spending excessive amounts of time on social media too."

JordanPeterson,fexsy3r,t1_fexsamx,1579435585.0,"It does when it doesn't addresses the whole problem and nit picks what is common. Why people watch porn, why people aren't socialising, why people are intoxicating themselves, why people aren't going to the gym and other such issues.

I saw a post where the guy was doing even better than me but still ended his life because of depression as was written by his sister; look at Chris Cornell, Chester Bennington."

I do most of the activities, I don't do any sort of drugs let alone smoking, I don't watch porn, I go to the gym, I cook my food which is not junk, I socialize, I have an aim in my life and guess what I still feel like shit every day, everyday is hard and I am so depressed some days that the only way to get rid of that depressing session is to masturbate till I get tired and then sleep it off. Lately I am trying not to use porn and masturbating as a coping mechanism but it's hard ."

JordanPeterson,fecys4k,t3_eo9nhi,1578990239.0,"It's really easy to blame but harder to be responsible . I believe everything that has a norm or a standard is a stigma and what we do with it defines ourselves. It does not has to be the way it was and you can change it sometimes not hurting the ones who were the pioneers of it. People who blame patriarchy or label it with everything, think that it is the norm when in truth it is in certain places but in most places it's not. People usually look towards men to take charge and while women might get mocked for taking charge but if the mockery stops that woman than it's her fault. As a society we need to be more kinder, appreciative and welcoming of change or at least give it a chance . Men and woman are not equal, nobody's equal, it's a concept put forth by the government to impose a sense of solidarity. We're only equal in terms of our will to be better and aspire for growth, we're only equal when we are kind, we're only equal if we stop comparing ourselves with others."
