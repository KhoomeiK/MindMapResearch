i am a lot similar to ur situation. been many years. got better, thought it was actually better, but then realized it is slowly kicking back whenever something changes in life. although in my case, I find things easier to cope with when I go into a small space like a bathroom or something for 15 mins or so."
depression,fejatcu,t3_cml6ni,1579164639.0,"The past few days didn't get better or too worse. I lost focus a lot of times, like I couldn't look into the computer screen when my thoughts were too occupied. Then I tried hard to pick myself back up to continue doing my regular stuff. I suspect some of the anxiety should come from finding jobs and stuff, but man these thought intervals are becoming more continuous when I am alone. jesus."

depression,fdjadgf,t3_cml6ni,1578463160.0,"I am trying hard to stay away from negative thoughts, but then got backstabbed and let go from my dev job at New Year's Eve. Today got rejected from the final round of interview even though passing all the technical questions (maybe sucked at behavioral questions). And I am just staring between my computer screen and my will. I just want to get so tired and then fall asleep for a while so my brain doesn't think too much."
