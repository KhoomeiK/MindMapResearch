dogs,fffh9gn,t3_et8uk8,1579883923.0,"Where I work, we have something called Puppy Play School. What they do is take the puppies out into the daycare yards (separated by size) and they are monitored while playing with the daycare dogs.

This is a very important thing for the puppies, as it teaches them how to play with other dogs. We encourage them when they are playing well, (wrestling, taking turns jumping on each other, playing chase etc.) and let the dogs tell them when they’re doing something wrong. The dogs will tell them off. That is the best way for the puppies to learn how to socialize. 

Obviously we put them with dogs we know they will be safe with. We have one dog who absolutely hates having puppies in his face, so we don’t put the puppies in the same yard as him. But the puppies are watched closely, no matter who they’re with. 

If you are worried, I’d recommend looking for a class like that where your puppy can learn to socialize with other dogs. It’s good for them and also gives your older dog a break from the puppy.!"
