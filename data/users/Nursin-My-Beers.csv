reddeadfashion,fe69vz7,t3_enu13n,1578885040.0,"I think about Dutch a lot, especially his meeting with Colm. Colm says, « still believing in that better world », or something like that, and it makes me think, was that Dutch’s plan? To create a more just world, or America? Did he believe that through action he could somehow change the direction of America? And in that meeting, it’s just so sad how realistically Dutch hadn’t come close to his goal, and he realistically was no better than Colm. I wonder if after that meeting Dutch was bleeding. « Spartans wore red so their enemies could never see them bleed ». But then you think, how many people believed in Dutch too, and all for nothing. And then you think, Dutch was smart. Someone like him knew the scale of the U.S government, and definitely knew that no group of 10 or 11 could change anything. So why did he keep lying to everyone? Was it guilt that he felt, and that by the time of RDR2 it was too late, and by admitting that they were just outlaws would somehow betray those that were closest to him? Was it loyalty or deception? I think about Dutch a lot"
