Well that’s my point exactly.  
Most people in the US don’t use metric which means they’re not used to it, which means they don’t “grasp it”. 

It took me w while to get a somewhat decent hang on the imperial system because I hadn’t used it before. Then I married an American and spent a decent amount of time in the US and after doing enough of maths in my head each time I heard a measurement, I started to get a hang of it. Some easier than others (pounds is easy because it’s x/2-10%, feet are  30cm, yards are 90cm, miles and Fahrenheit are bullshit though, etc.). 

But most Americans never do that as they don’t need to because the US stays in the imperial system. So they don’t grasp it in a everyday use-way.

Elementary kids going to school either by bike or using public transportation on their own makes them “targets for kidnapping”.

We don’t have enough income!” and I said it’s fine, since you’re unemployed you’ll get unemployment benefits and I’ll get student benefits (not crazy sums, around 1k €) to float us until you get another job.

Am from Finland and I agree.  

Time for a short story:
I lived in this certain part of Helsinki for seven years and then left and was living abroad/travelling for two years.  
When I got back I spent my first night sleeping by the beach (it was summertime) by a little fire I had made as I had arrived at 0300. I had missed the nightless nights of the Nordics and its sweet summers.  
In the morning I had a swim, dried off and started walking around my old hoods a it was a nice day.  
Got hungry and remembered my old pizzeria called Shine, which was close by.  

The moment I entered and the owner looked up from the counter and said with a smile “Ah! Pineapple, shrimp, tuna, blue cheese!”   
That’s when I knew I was home.  
We had a nice little chat as he asked where I’ve been for so long and all.  
I still think of the pizzeria from time to time when I’m getting pizza where I live now."

The thing with wieght is that it affects so many other things as well.  
It puts pressure on organs, it does a real number on joints and makes it more difficult to move, to have energy, etc.

That said, people who are skinny but live with chicken nuggets once a day that's chugged with some diet soda are definitely far from healthy.

The Points if Interest should not be on the map and be things you’d stumble upon and it would make the world more lived in instead of a giant list of things the player’s “got” to do.  

There should be a looot less of bandits and monsters around just for the sake of it because they become dull reeeaal fast like.  

This one’s silly, but not fond of the “I’ve lived on a diet is scotch and Marlboro and disappointment of my father since I was five which is why my voice is all real low and manly like” that is too damn common.
