Being heavy is constantly hard on my knees. I am pregnant and was told to quit running for a while (bad nurse) and now I can't pick it up again because it is too hard with all the weight I have on me.

CrappyDesign2,feojeee,t1_feo8wpx,1579300887.0,This is convenient. I have lived in houses that had a pin hole in the handle so you'd have to go find the little key for it. It was awful when my younger sister would lock the door then panic. A flush slot would also be hard because not everyone carries change. This isn't a bad design.

So it'll probably be another fight with a doctor who refuses to give me anything other than the pill. I wanted an IUD years ago and was told by the doctor that they insisted I go on the pill. Then it took me years to find one that worked ok and it still gave me bad symptoms of depression, but at least it didn't make me nauseous like the first type of pill did."

ShitMomGroupsSay,fdzq6ud,t1_fdzpzkn,1578793261.0,There are women who care. It is just mostly preference. It won't make a clitoral orgasm easier. It also doesn't necessarily make a vaginal one easier.

A gym membership is another cost that would be nice, but probably isn't in my budget.

About the fetus. It never seems to care about the situation or health of the mother nor the situation or health of the child once it is born. 

Why should a child with a horrific genetic disorder have to suffer for a few hours after birth only to die  because people don't like abortions?

Why should a woman in an abusive relationship or a child who was forced have to give birth, knowing their child may face the same abuse?

Pro choice people care about the woman AND the child."

So I did both and had little 60s themed nuclear propaganda things around in the fall pumpkins and sunflowers. Plus a little burlap here and there went well with the retro semi-mcm feel of the place. Our colors were burnt orange, grey, and yellow specifically because it matched well with the colors from the 60s that were intermittently spread throughout the location. 

MCM also used a lot of wood grain and rounded natural shapes. I think both could work fairly well together."
