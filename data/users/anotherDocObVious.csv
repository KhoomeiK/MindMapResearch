Alternatively, similar to specters in game, the Sand Shadow will copy your Warframe and loadout, but will only make use of your primary weapon. Equipping a weak or unmodded primary weapon will essentially make the Sand Shadow harmless, allowing you to ignore it and focus on the Tomb Protector.

Do you have Mag? If so, you can equip a projectile based secondary such as the Mara Detron, build it for corrosive blast (you need to get 100% status chance before adding Multishot mods), cast Magnetize on the Tomb Protector and dump bullets into the bubble.

If you have Rhino, there's always Iron Skin + Roar.
