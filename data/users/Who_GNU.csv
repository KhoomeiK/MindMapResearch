(The airplane speed part, not the TSA part, because they still fail to catch most test decoys.)

Modern airplanes have high-bypass turbofans, which don't get much thrust from the jet engine itself, but from a large fan the the jet engine powers.  Because of this, they aren't as fast as pure jets, but they do get much better gas mileage.

On the plus side, between the high fuel efficiency and high seat utilization, airlines now have lower fuel usage per passenger mile than trains in the US ever had.  They also require far less infrastructure, with only one to two mile long runways instead of trans-continental railways, so the environmental impact of the infrastructure itself is lower.

There's also been successful deregulation in airlines, unlike train monopolies, which are larger than they've ever been, while not sacrificing safety, which is higher in airlines than any other form of travel.

Altogether, the airplanes that made once prominent train travel into a small niche have at least made cross-country travel cheaper, faster, and safer, all while reducing the environmental impact."
NoStupidQuestions,femafey,t1_felrj3d,1579245911.0,"Federal law always any state to back out of Daylight Savings time with nothing more than a state declaration.  California almost did just that with Proposition 7 in 2018, but it was majorly derailed.  The reason why is an interesting story.

There's many preferences that are split pretty evenly between people, and disproportionately those with one specific preference are intolerant of those with the other.  For example, introverts are usually fine with the existence of extroversion, but extroverts are far less tolerant of introversion, often pushing for policies to reward and incentivize extroverted behavior.

The same goes for early birds and night owls.  Night owls don't mind the existence of early birds, but early birds tend dislike the behavior of night owls.

Because of this, a small subset of the organization that sponsored the proposition changed it from a version that would have immediately ended daylight savings, putting us on permanent pacific standard time, to a proposition that requires a two-thirds vote of the state legislature to change daylight savings time, in hopes that the federal government would allow the state to switch to year-round mountain standard time, and that the legislature would vote to go along with the switch, thereby incentivizing early-bird behavior in the state population.  This far more complex path isn't likely to happen any time soon.

Had the proposition immediately ended daylight savings time, and left a switch to mountain standard time as a separate matter, the state would already be done with daylight savings time."
