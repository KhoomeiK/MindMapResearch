No ambiguity, none. Just a simple direction that works regardless of whether the player is upside fucking down or sideways or anything other than normal."

ontario,femtxfv,t1_femhdmw,1579269496.0,"1. Momentum from the previous government takes the lion's share of the credit for that. These things don't happen overnight.

2. ""Low unemployment"" is a great talking point that conveniently leaves out the higher underemployment: one can argue that any job is better than none at all but that's beside the point. A ton of low wage workers doesn't really do much for the economy: no money to really contribute."

The three stops on Laurier at uOttawa might be worse: two are on the same block and easily within 50 metres of each other, the third is a block away and maybe double the distance. Smh"
mildlyinfuriating,fe64u3o,t1_fe5ktbv,1578881812.0,"Respectfully, what part of those ideas are ""centrally planned"" (your words)?

I personally don't see any specific planning here, just boundaries within which companies must operate; read: *how* they operate isn't directed, only that the methods they use fall within the boundaries set. Same goes for any sane, rational, and reasonable regulation.

>And it doesn't change the fact that, if you stop buying, they'll stop making. This is basic common sense. They're not just gonna make that stuff for it to sit around in a warehouse to rot.

This is where the personal responsibility idea fails: the number of informed individuals who vote with their wallets is a tiny fraction of those who don't or can't :("

Citation: Ottawa transit and the clusterfuck that is our transition to LRT (when we could've *started* with LRT; see my post history for my comment that I made just before this one)."
todayilearned,fdlwopd,t1_fdl0ugv,1578534302.0,"Yup, and while my country (Canada) is better, it's nowhere near what it could be (and don't give me shit about distances, it's irrelevant: public transit within a given metro area doesn't qualify for the distance argument (ditto for internet)). As for the distances between major population centres, it *could* be done given the political willpower.

Where I'm living now (Ottawa), we *just* got light rail, but only after 40+ years of ""we don't need it so instead of going for LRT, we'll go for BRT"". There was a decision between the two way back when and busses were the choice; hence, the city has been developed around roads and not rail, making the transition to rail stupid expensive."

Vive,fclk1h2,t3_ehmo3u,1577749603.0,"Semi-related: when I launch via steam, I'm given multiple options on how to run it (default, dx12, vulkan, VR). I'm aware that dx12 and vulkan are experimental so them crashing isn't a massive problem but I'm confused about the behaviour wrt default vs VR: both start steamvr and boot VR mode for me. Is there a way to force steamvr to *not* launch for default? It's not that I'm averse to VR (I love it!) but when I'm playing via steam link or something, the VR kinda kills it."
