ABoringDystopia,ffjylsq,t1_ffjrbqw,1580010535.0,"Oh it wont be covered 100% unless theyre on Medicaid. They will have a percentage of that bill they will need to pay in the future after insurance does their ""negotiating"" and paying their portion. Point is, this is not a bill and he is not being asked to pay anything right now while he is grieving. There are certainly things there i would be fighting the charges on given she died. But i dont know the exact details. If she died in the table then charging him anything for the ICU is bogus."

ABoringDystopia,ffjoc4g,t1_ffjo5ij,1580002908.0,Are you trying to be obtuse? Its so you know what is being charged and for what. So they cant just make shit up that theyre billing for. Likeb in this specific exampleb i would likely fight the ICU charges because it seems she didnt actually use them as she died in surgery.
ABoringDystopia,ffjnmnz,t1_ffjnjab,1580002431.0,Its literally a consumer protection that you receive that
ABoringDystopia,ffjmdws,t1_ffjjnd2,1580001591.0,A summary of charges and bitching about receiving it and the price tag does not speak about care being prioritized in any way. These normally take a few months to come in in ky experience. How much time did he expect them to hold off on sending it in respect to his loss?
SelfAwarewolves,ffji9lu,t3_etydxt,1579998814.0,So close and yet...
WeWantPlates,ffjhyqt,t3_etyjfp,1579998613.0,This was a crab boil at a crab boil place why would you expect differently? .

curlyhair,ffjh9rw,t1_ffdxhq8,1579998201.0,Its the look she likes a guess. She legit gets a perm to have the curls and her mom has curly hair (idk if its natural or not) and SHE seems to know what shes doing with thembso i habe to ask me shes doing it on purpose.
ABoringDystopia,ffjh1ms,t1_ffjezhm,1579998071.0," No, it doesn't. Like i already replied before you commented, i received one of these every month or two after transplant myself for about a year while insurance was processing the claim and never had to pay a dime myself.This is stating what theyre sending to insurance. This isnt some immediate demand for payment like it's implied to be.

And yea. Sucks to sick but people deserve to be paid for work done even if the patient dies. Thats ALWAYS a risk of surgery and not a reason to flake on the bill unless there was gross negligence involved. Now. I would probably dispute the ICU charges given if she died on the table they never actually used it. But this document is a legal consumer protection so ypu.know what ypure heing charged and for what"
ABoringDystopia,ffjdscs,t1_ffjcbrx,1579996153.0,Yea. I got those all the time after my transplant even though it was covered 100% by insurance. I never had to pay anything.

Wouldnt take the decision seriously, in my case, because my puberty hormones slammed shut and didnt start back up until after transplant.  But im so sorry you had issues finding someone afterwards to do it. Told my gyn i was still interested at my next check up and she referred me right down to a gun down at the hospital that did the transplant since they worked with eachother and were more familiar with the plumbing changes.
