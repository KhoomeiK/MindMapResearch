Basically, I've found that as a warm down for legs, eccentric body weight exercises (not mad reps) are really good. So I was wondering if people had a set way of doing eccentric exercises for the big four.

Loading with tons of weight isn't the goal per se, as I've only ever known these for injury prevention training.

Thinking just finishing off the day with body weight ones will be fine - except for OHP, I can't do handstands :P"

Fitness,femqtky,t1_femq8vp,1579266923.0,"I saw this just recently... oddly I find it helps with recovery massively, as I said I started doing them for my injury rehab. I'm not doing a full set of exercises to try and gain strength though, I do body weight stuff (nordic curls, heel drops etc) for 10-15 reps after stretching and it feels great.

So was wondering what other things would be good to target the same areas the big four target - I assume pistol squats, eccentric push-ups (lower...downs?) and....something else for OHP?"

Some countries seem to think that you should never change because change is bad and the problems should give way to you by righteous might or something!

Only an idiot faces a problem and assumes it must change for them."
