He would realize that the case against Adnan was a lot shakier, and by the time SK showed up at his door, he’d know that Adnan probably hadn’t done it.

Plus, if you want to accuse the police of coercing a false testimony from Jay, you also have to assume that they also coerced a false testimony from Jen with her mother and lawyer present. You have to assume they knew where Hae’s car was, but didn’t document it or process it immediately. It’s just not plausible."

I'm not really sure what you mean by ""healthy confirmation."" But I also know that the aversion to out-crossing is really hurting several breeds.

The influence of non-conformation-based titling in dog breeding is great. I'm personally of the opinion that conformation has done at least as much harm as it has good. Besides, dog breeds existed long before the advent of dog showing. I think in order for conformation to be continued ethically, there needs to be a move away from extreme features (loose skin, short legs, brachycephaly, etc) and more of a focus on health test results and personality."

The problem with designer dogs is that the people breeding them tend to see it as a primary source of income rather than as a part time hobby. In fact, I think it would probably be good for dogs and good for people if dog showing were less a factor in breeding. There’s no inherent reason that breeding mixed dogs is bad, as far as I know."

serialpodcast,fennzwt,t1_fenkt34,1579288444.0,"> Going in to Adnan's house and planting evidence during the search could cause more problems that it solves, especially as they had an unknown quantity in Jay. If you plant a piece of evidence that then becomes an impossibility to be there, you've not only destroyed your entire case, but you're probably going to end your career.

It could also destroy their entire career to coerce Jay and Jen to make up a story about how Adnan killed Hae. Like, if either one of them comes out with the story of how these cops had them make up a story wholesale (especially the white college girl with a fucking lawyer), that's equally bad for them. 

>However, when you look at the forensics report of the car, they just found Hae's belongs in the trunk, and ZERO trace evidence, which is effectively impossible if the body was transported in the trunk. There wasn't even transfer from her clothes which apparently sat there for 6 weeks until the car was discovered.

First of all, a shirt with Hae's blood on it was found in her trunk. It may have been from prior, or it may have come come up out of her throat as her body sat there for 5 hours. But that's actually beside the point: you say that it's impossible for her body to have been in the trunk and not to have left evidence, but is that true? What evidence ""should"" you expect to find? Skin cells? Most of her body was covered in clothing. Hair? It was up in a bun.

>The we have the car discovery itself. I constantly hear the argument that it's just impossible for the police to have known where the car is, yet I've never once heard a credible reason why other than some idiotic charge that it would take some giant overarching conspiracy involving entire departments to pull it off (absolute bullshit). . . All it would have taken is either Ritz or McG to have had an informant CI tell them about the car, but just ""finding it"" doesn't shore up their case.

It's impossible because it would mean that they didn't immediately process, document, and secure this key piece of evidence. If they had, there would be documentation. It would mean that instead, they left it in a lot where it could easily have been stolen for god knows how long. Like, if they really think Adnan did the crime, shouldn't getting evidence from that car be their #1 priority? Instead of a convoluted plan to get this sketchy kid to ""lead"" them to the car? 

>Having Jay ""tell"" where it is gives them a slam dunk in Jay's credibility becuase now he knows something materially linked to the case, not just he said vs he said.

Jay already ""told"" them the burial position and what she was wearing. Even if that's all false and they told him everything beforehand, they could have done the same with the car."
serialpodcast,fengvpq,t1_fen3q79,1579284417.0,"There’s no question that police corruption happens, and is much more common than we’d like to think. But to believe that the cops would go to such great lengths to frame Adnan goes beyond coercing a false confession, or planting a physically small piece of evidence. It requires that they delay the processing and documentation of a key piece of evidence, leaving it in a place where it could easily be stolen, and then also getting another fake witness to implicate herself as an accessory after the fact with her lawyer present. 

Plus, honest question, how many of these other railroaded suspects had top-tier legal representation? How many of them had an entire community rallied around lending support? How many were middle-class? I honestly don’t know. I would guess the people typically falsely convicted have far less support than Adnan did (and does) but I have no data to back that up."

>And the cops could have simply talked to Jen before without her lawyer. It's not like they would have documented the conversation where they discuss false testimony....

So the police have no record of the conversation where they coerce Jen into making up a fake story? Good thing for them Jen didn’t then tell her lawyer about this and give the true version when she’s actually being recorded and has legal backup."
