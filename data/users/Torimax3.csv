depression,ffep95f,t1_ffda5gq,1579858560.0,"I know what you mean but she gives me no reason to not trust her or anything. Yes, things I said were once used against me (by another therapist) but she is really nice, so I do think that I can trust her but it's like I've never learned to be open about my feelings or anything. I just feel so uncomfortable in my skin when I talk about my problems. Don't be sorry, just that you try is enough :)"
depression,ffc8ko8,t1_ffbogei,1579794008.0,"definietly! it felt like I was trying to turn my inside to the outside, trying to let the feelings bleed out or anything."
depression,ffc8ebd,t1_ffaurcw,1579793895.0,"Same. The last 2 years, I haven't done it regular but sometimes I break in again. I also use a rubber band when I am in public and suddenly feel overwhelmed or just got the urge to do it."
depression,ffc886i,t1_ffanc52,1579793785.0,Same. I was definietly overwhelmed with my feelings but I just wonder why the hell I decide to let it out on myself!
depression,ffc859w,t1_ffaktwh,1579793732.0,We sit in the same boat. I really wish I could go back in the head of my 12 year old self and find out why I thought this could help. Because of that one stupid thought I've been wearing long sleeve clothes since I was 12. I never had the urge to make me feel alive or anything because I actually wished to be dead but I guess it was just a kind of release to me because I was overwhelmed with all those feelings inside me.
depression,ffc7y0s,t1_ffag50w,1579793605.0,I don't think I've ever really comforted myself when I was in emotional pain....
depression,ffc7vp9,t1_ffa46wi,1579793564.0,"I understand that a lot. Sometimes when I felt that crushing feeling on my chest and I felt myself getting nervous and my breath started to hitch, I would need to hurt myself in any way as a release."
depression,ffc7st1,t1_ffa3dr3,1579793512.0,"I really understand the overwhelming part. My 12 year old-self couldn't comprehend the wish of dying and all this negative emotions. I did use razorblades but I burned myself a few times too and did other stuff to hurt myself.

I only do it ocassionaly now (and everytime I do it, I feel so ashamed) but I got some scars that will never go away and I've been wearing long sleeve clothes for the last 7 years because of them."
depression,ffc7ihx,t1_ffa1gdk,1579793327.0,"This is something I can heavly relate to. It definitely was and still is a relief for me and I did realized at some point that I am happy that I am hurting myself, instead of letting it out on others. But that has a limit too. I realized when someone is shitty to me and I haven't done anything wrong and I am angry, my first thought is cut myself, just because I need release of the emotions and don't wanna hurt anyone else."
depression,ffc7b0c,t1_ffajmy1,1579793193.0,Same. I need the blood to run down my arm or I'll feel like I didn't do it right.
depression,ffc787y,t1_ffa69lm,1579793143.0,I do understand the distraction part. It really distracted me from anything else that was going on and gave you a short moment of ''peace''
depression,ffc75h7,t1_ffakxzb,1579793094.0,I've only once cut a word inside my skin and the first latter never healed and it's not a scar.
depression,ffc70p6,t1_ff9xe8e,1579793007.0,I can realte to that too. At some point it really just turned into a impulse. Self-harm is a quite bigger spectrum as you may think. I cut myself but also burned myself a few times or stopped eating until it hurts or just like you say running until I would just collapse.
depression,ffc6tsc,t1_ff9ye3c,1579792883.0,I do understand what you are saying. It kinda made me feel calm? when I saw the cuts and the scars. I don't really know why. I did it in School too a few times because the urge was there and when I feel myself getting more anxious and there is this heavy feeling on my chest and I feel like I'll go crazy. It makes me kinda calm.
depression,ffc6mko,t1_ffaim96,1579792751.0,"Yeah, exactly. It was almost like I tried to let the anger and sadness bleed out of me or something. On top of that I never could stop until I had a lot of fresh cuts. Don't know why and I feel embarassed for it but it was like I was never satisfied with just one cut and had to do it until my arm looked like battlefield."
depression,ffc6aw4,t1_ff9vl3g,1579792538.0,"The therapist thing really has nothing to do with abandonment, that's just the trust issue thing. I feel the Abandonment issue by family and friends plus the trust issue. I've told myself so many times that I pay her for listening to me, that this is her fuc*ing job but it just never works. I don't know why. Everytime I think about what I am gonna talk about with her and in the end I just can't open my mouth."
depression,ff9usbj,t1_ff9ugt9,1579721879.0,"I am so sorry that you feel this way because there is literally no one who is dumb or anything, we just live in a society that sucks. But I do relate to the part of being restless. When that thought suddenly pops up, it is really hard to resist."
depression,ff9ujx1,t1_ff9tau3,1579721690.0,"Yeah, that's true..."
depression,ff9uidl,t1_ff9tyrm,1579721656.0,"Oh, while reading that I realized that this might the reason why I do it too. Because I remember when I am angry or sad and I didn't know how to let it out and got overwhelmed, doing it always distracted me because suddenly I had to be careful that no one comes in or that my clothes don't get stained or just making the bleeding stop. It's weird that for the first time I feel like this really could be a reason."
depression,ff9rphz,t3_esg44c,1579719681.0,",, You just have to get up and do something '' Oh, really? Why haven't I thought about that? They make it sound like it's so easy when you are exhausted and tired of life. 

But I have to say one thing. I already have 3 suicide attempts behind me but I still make those jokes. They might be not that much of a joke as when other say it but I still let it sound like a joke."
depression,ff9mcdc,t1_ff9ijvd,1579716005.0,"Same. I always had so problems with getting any work done and in the eyes of my teachers and my mother, I was just lazy but it took energy I couldn't afford. Same. I thought there are probably a few people out there, who feel the same but seems like there are more than I thought. Makes you feel less crazy or something."
depression,ff9j9v7,t3_ese72r,1579714196.0,"This is an complex situation, so it's hard to say what might be right but as kind as it is to be there for your partner, you also have think about yourself. I know it's hard when people say such things like they will kill themselves if you walk away but you have to ask yourself, if there is still a part inside you that wants to save this relationship or if you feel just suffocated because of the situation. To a point, you can try to help her. Don't force her to anything even if it's hard. If she doesn't see herself that she needs help than you can do whatever you want, it won't work. Just be there for her. If she doesn't feel like going out then don't give her the feeling that you are annoyed or anything. Give her space but also never stop asking her how she feels. If the time is right you should also try to talk to her about your feelings. Tell her that you don't know what to do and what she wants you to do or what could help her. But at some point you also have to think about yourself. If she doesn't wanna go out but you feel like it and want to met up with some friends, then do it. Taking care of yourself is so important. People tend to forget how important. Just look into that group therapy thing. I know it's not easy but just try it out, maybe it can help you, maybe not. You just need to make sure that you are in a place where you can be there for someone else. I wish I could help you more but I don't know much about your situation and every human is different, so I guess trying to ask her and talk about your feelings might be the right step. Wish you the best luck"
depression,ff9i95b,t1_ff9hqld,1579713588.0,"Same. The only friend I was able to hold longer was my best friend. We met when we were both 13, so I wasn't as much of a train wreck as I am now and could befriend people a little easier but still I felt nothing when I ended our friendship."
depression,ff9hzre,t1_ff9d3p0,1579713429.0,"Everytime I felt someone distancing themselves from me( even if they actually weren't doing it and I just got paranoid) I pushed them away before they could push me away and it was never that hard because I made sure not to get too close to them. I guess one part of me is always thinking people will leave or I get hurt when I get too close. I know that my father was a really bad emotional abuser, like really bad but I just feel like this is just not enough to close up to such an extent. There are others who have way worse parents than me and they are able to open up, despite the things they parents have done."
depression,ff9h9ov,t1_ff9d9ji,1579712987.0,I did made friends in the past and all but I never allowed it to be more than just school friends because I didn't want anyone to get too close to me.
depression,ff9bipu,t1_ff8dlo8,1579709194.0,"Yeah, Motivation hasn't been present for more than a few days in quite a while. I actually feel a little less alone, knowing that I am not the only one. I always felt like I don't really want to get better because if you did you would work on it but I guess I just thought about attention seeking more than just me being exhausted and having no motivation."
depression,ff9b9li,t1_ff87j2h,1579709031.0,"Feels like I wrote this. I dropped out of college 3 months ago to focus on my health for the first time and stop using distraction to live on but that didn't last long. Now I am a drop out, sit on the PC for hours and wait for the day to be finally over. I really don't have any motivation."
depression,ff9b3zl,t1_ff86n37,1579708933.0,I know what you mean. The lack motivation has been in my life since I was quite young. I guess I have always been too exhausted and overwhelmed with everything.
