saltierthancrait,ff9ukx5,t1_ff97r8t,1579721711.0,"> I would argue that Finn, being a combat trained stormtrooper, could pick up any melee weapon and hold his own against another combat trained stormtrooper in a melee fight.

This seems to be such an unlikely scenario that it doesn't merit telling Finn to take it, just in case it happened. Stormtroopers so rarely use melee weapons and it was kind of silly to see the trooper throw down his blaster which could have killed Finn quickly in favor of his little taser stick. The only reason it was done is because it supposedly looked cool."

DebateReligion,ff9ozel,t3_esfa9c,1579717651.0,"Why are these the only two possibilities? Consider for a moment your position and outlook on existence compared with that of an all-powerful God. Not to diminish the human experience, but our point of view is quite limited. That which we find to be the most unpleasant or horrific aspects of life could be, in the grand scheme of things, very minor. 

Think about a small child whose parents punish him or force him to do something which he finds incredibly unpleasant. From his perspective, his parents are simply being cruel by putting him in time out or making him do extra math homework. We know however, that these are not really that bad in the grand scheme of things, and further that these serve a real purpose, ultimately for the child's benefit. 

Now I can understand why you might come to this conclusion given the circumstances of our existence, but to conclude that cruelty or incompetence are the *only* options seems rather closed-minded. I'm not sure how you can completely foreclose the possibility that free will, suffering, and sin serve some higher purpose which we cannot fully understand."

As a Muslim who regularly engages in discussion on Islam across various subreddits, I have to say that is not my experience *at all*. I have seen so many comments and posts which don't even raise a legitimate argument or criticism, but rather are intentionally offensive and serve no other purpose. 

""Muslims are all (goatfuckers/pedophiles/inbred/terrorists/backwards/insult of your choice).""

 Only the particularly well moderated subs will ban people for that type of comment, and only if it is particularly egregious. Most don't seem to care at all. Hell, there was a guy posting porn and insulting Muslims in /r/islam a few months back and I'm not sure if he was banned, but if he was it took quite a long time."

Now that very well may have been the plan, but I think Anakin was just too powerful for Dooku to you with. 

Personally, I’ve always thought of it as Palpatine’s final test, which he passed handily. He sensed Anakin’s ability and was confident that he would beat Dooku, so I don’t think he told Dooku to hold back. It was an honest fight for who would be his apprentice, he was just fairly certain that Anakin would prevail. On the off chance that Dooku won, the plan would have proceeded with him as his apprentice."
