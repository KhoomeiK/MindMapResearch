Divorce,fff37kp,t3_et9c8l,1579874484.0,"A couple of weeks ago, an old friend from like eight years ago sent me a long text telling me that she keeps thinking about this time we played tennis together and how she misses when we used to hang out. It really touched me and made me feel loved. Unfortunately, she lives far away now and we can't see each other that easily, but the moral of the story is that people like when old friends reach out. It made me happy for the whole week."
Divorce,ffbysxx,t3_esnqfk,1579787050.0,"Wow, that's pretty bad. I would definitely seek counseling because it's going to affect your whole life and future relationships. And I agree with those who say to get away from your parents. Save up money to move out."
Divorce,ffbxv7z,t1_ffbuzz4,1579786263.0,"I am a woman who finds emotional intelligence sexy as hell. Also, emotional vulnerability and openness is a bigger turn-on than how someone looks. Divorced men have an advantage here, as the inward journey that y'all have gone through give you so much depth."
IndieExchange,fepre3n,t1_fenne3x,1579328719.0,Yes! That'll be $26. I'll PM you the deets.
depression,femefud,t1_fejxkw2,1579251234.0,"Wow, your mom sounds like she's got a full plate. She's a strong lady and I hope that she can find some rest somehow. I've also recently been thinking that it's my mom that keeps my whole family together. My dad has depression and has isolated himself in another country, my brother has anxiety and anger towards my dad for leaving us (and will lash out at all of us), and I'm just barely scraping by after I self-sabotaged my own dreams for the future. Nobody talks to each other, but my mom makes it a point to call everyone and ask how they are doing, and updates the rest of us if someone needs help. 

I can tell that you really love and respect your mom. I know you feel guilty, but I'm sure that without you she'd be really sad and alone. Being sad and alone is the WORST for moms."

ENFP,fejndd9,t3_ep1sav,1579180677.0,"Give yourself time to grieve the end of the relationship. Let yourself be sad and cry. If you skip over this step, it could affect your next relationship or this might take a super long time to get over."
ENFP,fejmsla,t3_ep8otv,1579180154.0,"I (female) get nervous around guys that I like. Also, my family wasn't very affectionate growing up, so it's not that easy for me to start being affectionate with someone new. The only way to find out what she's thinking is to ask her."

Indiemakeupandmore,fej9l4i,t1_fegiens,1579162907.0,"I've seen a lot of rope-y hemp products, and that's how the hemp in RR smells to me--kind of fibrous, dry, and rope-y. Cannabis smells more green, damp, with a bit of funk. I love both the RR perfume oil and hair gloss. Every time I wear it, I think about getting another backup. It's the only perfume that I'd consider getting a third bottle of. The only problem is that when I wake up with it still on my wrists, it makes me really hungry."

depression,fegldjj,t1_fegkwo4,1579096352.0,"Aww, man. That's such a complicated situation. I'm sorry you are going through this. And it sounds painful for everyone involved. I don't blame you for keeping your distance. It's important that you protect yourself."
depression,fegi1jk,t3_ep0j8b,1579093414.0,"My mom was really mean to me a couple of months ago and I found out later that she was just going through her own personal shit with her friends. I live with her and see her the most, so she thinks of me as an extension of her instead of as another person with feelings. Maybe you can ask her if there's something going on in her life that's bugging her or maybe you can just lie low until she gets over whatever is going on with her."
depression,feghdq2,t3_ep0v4i,1579092812.0,"I have a friend who thinks that he's always hurting people but they're just little things that other people actually forget after a couple of days. And all these things that you are doing (falling out of love, no interest in anything, watching movies constantly), he does, too. He's not a bad person. He's simply human. We all hurt each other a little bit, but then we get over it and move on to the next thing. He hurt me, too, but I cried for a little bit and read this sub and figured out that it wasn't personal--it was the depression that was doing it.

What did you do to your grandma to stop taking your calls?"

depression,fegglkw,t3_ep1ko7,1579092082.0,I didn't understand my depressed friend until I started reading this sub. Maybe you can read her some posts from here. Or show her some articles online that mirror how you feel.

ENFP,fe7k7v9,t1_fdydh96,1578915742.0,"Yes! I would say, rather than being an optimist, I'm more of someone who can see possibilities. I don't think everything's going to go well (that might be due to me being in my 40's) all the time."
ENFP,fe7jo16,t3_engz8p,1578915510.0,"I'd just text him, too. If he has kids, he probably doesn't want to play games and appreciates directness."

ENFP,fe7ilrb,t3_entkog,1578915036.0,You're going to make her more sad if you keep talking to her. You have to cut ties. She has to find other ways of coping that aren't you.
ENFP,fe7i9om,t3_entmkl,1578914880.0,"Same. If I can't find friends or family to hang out with, I'll go to a public place like a park or mall, where I can at least be around people."
ENFP,fe7f6kk,t1_fe2o36r,1578913799.0,"Anger can be helpful when you are sad because it helps you get off your butt and start doing things for yourself. Sadness, to me, is static. Anger is at least dynamic."

I think everyone would do the best they can if they could. Some just don't have the mental tools to get to that place. The rejection from applying to jobs is hard for me to take."

depression,fe6idh4,t3_enrs4c,1578891847.0,"As someone who wants her depressed friend to talk to her, please open up and talk to someone. I understand that it's hard to find someone who is safe and who won't make you feel like you're making a big deal out of a little thing (I have done this by accident when I'm actually trying to make my friend feel less alone), but if you find the right person who loves you enough to do research on how to support people with depression, it should help both you and your friend. I'm sorry on behalf of all of us who say the wrong thing. And be honest when we say something that hurts you. We don't know how you're taking it and we never want you to feel like that.

I love when my friends talk to me about their mental health. I feel honored that they feel safe enough to be so vulnerable in front of me."

Divorce,fdpxywr,t3_emnc4z,1578645307.0,"I see a lot of people mention that they are divorced on their Tinder profiles. To me (never married), it doesn't really matter. It's so hard to find someone that I like enough to go on a second date with, so if they have a good personality and aren't a jerk, I'm down to hang out and see where it goes. I'd just say it in the beginning and get it out of the way. Hell, it might even make for some good conversation."
ENFP,fdpxjsg,t3_emianf,1578644754.0,"I was in your situation, too. The only thing you can do is to tell him how you feel. I did it over text because I didn't want him to try to be nice.

I think you're maybe thinking too generically about ENFPs. We are not all like how ENFPs are ""supposed"" to be. All of my breakups are due to mounting problems in the relationship over time and not because I fell in love with someone else. My interests and hobbies may change, but I still love those that I love. They're the ones that I excitedly talk to about my new hobby when I come home."

Why don't you take classes after work at a community college? Then, put together a portfolio, get someone who works in that field to look over it for you, then look into freelancing or applying to positions."

I'm a night owl and my work starts in the afternoon, so I actually do stay up until the sun comes up. I'm so lucky to have him in my life!

I always wear sheer sunscreen and eyeliner. I like to sleep as much as possible, so I often don't have much time in the morning to get ready. I do like to experiment with makeup, though. I feel as though I have many sides to my personality and I'm not often verbal, so I dress emotionally. You can tell how I'm feeling by what I'm wearing and the colors I have on my face. I'm an artist/oil painter, so it's a part of my self expression."

ENFP,fdg5dq1,t3_el0xou,1578380685.0,My impulsive reactions have decreased as I've gotten older. I'm almost always looking at the big picture now.
ENFP,fdg4m4d,t3_el7aes,1578379819.0,"Yoko Ono. [Amazing and very vulnerable performance artist.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfe2qhI5Ix4)

Patti Smith. Such integrity and love for words and poetry. Not overly concerned with how she looks/the male gaze.

Susan Sontag. Fiercely independent cultural critic and wide-ranging intellect. “Do stuff. be clenched, curious. Not waiting for inspiration's  shove or society's kiss on your forehead. Pay attention. It's all about paying attention. Attention is vitality. It connects you with others. It makes you eager. stay eager.”"
ENFP,fdg2mz3,t3_el58k6,1578377737.0,"Yep, this was me yesterday with the INFP that I'm crushing hard on. I was trying hard not to verbalize it too much, though, because I don't want to minimize his problems or say that how he views himself/the world is wrong. Internally, I'm like, I LOVE HOW YOU'RE SUCH A SNOB AND EVERYTHING ANNOYS YOU EXCEPT ME AND I LOVE YOU."
ENFP,fd9i74d,t3_ek0p8u,1578233651.0,"This is me, too. I like to be around people, but usually I'm listening and taking in information. I like to observe."
ENFP,fd2gf4b,t3_ejl3uo,1578146847.0,"Today at work, I was going CRAZY that no one was texting me back. Like, I wanna talk to people all the time! About feelings! Emotions!"
ENFP,fd2g3v1,t3_ejtun1,1578146716.0,"Sometimes when I have really good, vulnerable, emotional conversations with introverts, I do get this feeling of being in love. I'll drive home afterwards dancing to my favorite music, and I'll be on a high for days."
ENFP,fd2dalg,t3_ejitzw,1578145558.0,I think I would be really jealous that my SO is so into other people. I prefer an introvert who only wants to hang out with me. :)
ENFP,fd2cckp,t3_ejspov,1578145171.0,"I am not male, but if I were with someone who had erectile dysfunction, I'd get them to use their hands on me and do other stuff besides penetration. There's a lot of other fun stuff out there!"
ENFP,fd2bvo3,t3_ejsrky,1578144959.0,"I get this, too, but I don't think it's just ENFPs. All of my friends seem to be feeling this way, unfortunately."
ENFP,fd2bpqi,t1_fd0ou9h,1578144886.0,I love how specific this is! I've never really thought of Budapest but now I want to go there and visit the Jewish quarter.
ENFP,fd2bgga,t3_ejsgs0,1578144762.0,"A couple of years ago, there was this song that meant so much to me and encapsulated how I felt about my boyfriend. I played it for him and he didn't like it and I got really upset and hurt because of it. It wasn't even his type of music lol."
Divorce,fd1szkg,t1_fczlqk5,1578136338.0,"I'm in her boat. I've been seeing a newly-divorced guy. I told him that I had feelings and he told me that he wasn't ready (yet) for anything. That hurt a lot and I spent a couple nights crying, but I know in my heart that it is true. I just wanted to be wanted as much as I want him. But right now, I know for sure that he would be a terrible boyfriend and that I would suffer. I'm glad he told me, even though it was hard for both of us. It actually brought us closer together and we are continuing to hang out as friends. I'm trying to see other people so that I don't put all my hopes on him but it's hard because he's all I think about."
Divorce,fcxmnyb,t3_ebme8q,1578066597.0,"I'm so, so sorry this happened to you. I will definitely meet my dates in a public place from now on. Thank you for telling us."
Divorce,fcx27z4,t3_eiyyia,1578047965.0,"I suggest getting a massage, too. Not one of those happy-endings ones, just a nice, therapeutic muscle massage. I like going to massage schools because they are cheaper and I'm only semi-employed. There's the Aveda school and National Holistic Institute schools here in California. I've been single for a long time and it's nice to just have some non-sexual healing touch. One time, I almost cried because it made me feel like a child being held by my mom."
