trashy,fflm6go,t1_ffllc0e,1580041308.0,"I agree with you that stillwindow95’s comment sounded as if it’s based on all middle easterners, but they made it clear that they only meant some. When you responded, it sounded rude because you said “you shouldn’t be so ignorant.”
That’s all of what I have to say."

AskReddit,fcjgjua,t3_ehf10c,1577686791.0,"It’s not a big story or that interesting, but one time around 11 PM, I looked out of my bedroom window to see what was outside out of curiosity. I saw a person, or something, standing outside still as a statue. It was so dark I couldn’t see their face or tell what direction they were facing. I was scared at the time, so I tried to wake my parents up thinking that it was some person planning to kill us. I changed my mind and decided not to wake them up, so I went back to my room. When I looked out my window again, they were no longer there. The reason why I don’t think it was a person and instead a ghost was because between the amount of time I went to my parent’s room and back was so little that they couldn’t just disappear that fast. Needless to say i stayed up until midnight and nothing else happened after that"
