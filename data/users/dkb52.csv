I have 3 dogs, a female rotty, Australian shepherd, and a hound (all mixes). On walks, Millie (rotty) will scold the others if they start barking at someone. She'll side-bump them, start to climb on their backs from the side, show her teeth and growl, and push them back. It seems she's teaching them not to bark at everything that goes by. And they listen to her. She also insinuates herself between our dogs and an aggressive dog at the dog park."

They had some pretty obnoxious pop music on the radio back then, so I tuned my radio to the most annoying pop station, set the alarm, turned the volume way up, and placed it on a dresser across the room. Nothing could make me jump out of bed faster than listening to Michael Jackson blast out Rockin' Robin. My heartbeat went into overdrive trying to get to the radio to shut it up and there was no way I could fall asleep again. There were plenty of songs that worked well.

I had to do this to myself because I couldn't afford to be fired. After a while, all it took to wake me up was the click sound that came right before the music.
