Cant be much worse than a guy who argues with what he believes is an iran sympathizing bot. Especially when that bot said nothing about sympathizng the government, only said empathizing with the people who make none of those decisions. 

You realize by your logic as an american you are personally responsible for all the innocent deaths on the hands of US leaders and military"

facepalm,fdkpsk4,t1_fdknylg,1578508622.0,"No i wasnt being edgy, i think it is fundamentally wrong to ask someone who is a minor to pledge allegiance to a country that time and time again does terrible things. It is actual brainwashing and its done to children. I have and always will stand by that. If i have children i will tell them specifically not to stand for the pledge. 

This country will always have my support when it is helping people and it will always have my contempt when it harms people. I will never blindly be loyal to someone"
facepalm,fdkgioa,t1_fdkddcv,1578503389.0,It is indoctrination. I refused to stand for the pledge when i was in grade school. It got me in trouble but ill be damned if you expect me to be forced to pledge allegiance to anything. Everyone should have the right to choose their allegiance
