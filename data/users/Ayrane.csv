Taiwan has been operating like an fully independent country for decades now. Primary reason they wouldn't declare Independence was they need human resource China has to offer for many of their companies, for example, foxconn. China wants Taiwan to be part of it primarily because of the semiconductor technology it has to offer. Currently there are laws preventing technology transfer which are top two leading edge nodes. This makes Chinese semiconductor industry lag behind Taiwan. If they gain control over it, then they can dominate the global economy, technology, and data (potentially putting back doors into every chip)."
