No its not man made and the sound bite that 97% of climate scientists say so is false and has been debunked. Look it up. Yes you never said you think you have everything figured out, but it's evident that's what you think based on your hyperbole.

And yes I did answer your question. I told you what your problem was. You are hyperbolic. You think WW3 is about to happen and that Australia will burn into oblivion. 

***You are over empathic. And that's just as bad as being under empathetic.***"
