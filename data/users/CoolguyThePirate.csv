Pathfinder_RPG,ff9aohx,t1_ff92v7w,1579708662.0,"In my book poor stats mean playing a martial character in general is off the table.  The penalty for playing a martial with poor stats is too high when I can just be a full caster, put my highest roll into the one stat i care about and be 99% of the caster I would be if I had amazing rolls."
Pathfinder_RPG,ff8zc0n,t1_ff8fq7j,1579700799.0,Random stat rolls are pretty likely to make anyone competent at optimization ignore all MAD classes.  Bad stats hurt those classes way more than the others.  And they hurt you way worse than good stats would help you.

oklahoma,fec8yap,t3_eob0c6,1578968744.0,"The sad part about this is, after the bullshit with the 10 commandments statue, I see this as progressing in the right direction.  Maybe we should be more understanding.  

This is like when little Timmy almost makes it to the bathroom before peeing in his pants.  ""Good effort Mr. Senator, you're slightly less of an affront to the seperation of church and state, you'll figure it out next time.""

edit: i feel like either the sarcasm didn't make it through, or people just stopped reading part way through."

ImaginaryTechnology,fd2hmaj,t3_ejucxo,1578147353.0,I love that there are clearances cutout for the sweep of the front forks for steering because otherwise this would just be unrealistic.

oklahoma,fct5wr4,t1_fcsoonx,1577933702.0,A picture would have been just as superfluous as the video.  Adds nothing to the post in both cases.
MachinePorn,fcl2ql3,t1_fckz7zq,1577738532.0,"The driveshaft on a truck will have two u-joints.  One behind the transmission and one in front of the differential.  The u-joints on the transmission side will cause the velocity of the drive shaft to vary like in the gif, but to a lesser degree.  It would be enough to cause problems though.  But the u-joint on the front of the differential cancels it out."
AskReddit,fc5tvqk,t3_egar5e,1577465775.0,A very specific private key.

psispellcompendium,fbx10xt,t1_favgvrn,1577165299.0,I may need to try that out.  I'd probably actually run this spell all the time if it didn't cost 2 hotbar slots.

Pathfinder_RPG,fbwk20k,t1_fbuva4g,1577151992.0,I like how that encourages tense hurried math in the moment.  But it would still leave it very combat viable.  Which was the whole thing we were trying to avoid.
Pathfinder_RPG,fbtnjd5,t1_fbrlpwm,1577086227.0,"I like the way my table handles Sacred Geometry.  The casting time is increased by one minute per (adjusted) spell level.

So you still get your two for one free metamagic.  But you aren't going to use it in a fight.  So, a pretty big nerf that still feels worth a feat slot, and completely within the flavor of the feat.

The best feature of this nerf is that it will never slow down your turn in combat."
