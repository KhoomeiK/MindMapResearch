I live in a state where I just had to wait 5 months to get my pistol permit, after already having gone through multiple background checks in the past for 1. Working for my police department and 2. Working with a security clearance. It was a bit ridiculous.

That being said, I'm cool with having this permit because that means I will never have a waiting period again. I can walk into a gun store, see one I like, and walk out with it moments later. What I need is for the definition of assault rifle to stop being gradually changed to describe all guns. Some of the proposed laws in Virginia will outlaw:

- Specialty .22 pistols that some friends of mine own that are pretty much exclusively used for competition (magazine loads in front)

- Any shotgun that has a non-rigid stock (can't collapse or fold)

- Pretty much any rifle that isn't bolt action

Permits establish that I'm safe to own guns. So stop (not you, obviously) telling which I can and cannot have"

It's the baseball. Just hanging there, a little past my right shoulder. Not even moving slowly, just still. I didn't look at my friend so I can't say what he was doing, but I imagine he would be finishing up his swing. Suddenly I have this very strong urge to take the ball, like a command without a voice in my head. 

As soon as I grab it, I hear this rushing noise, like a strong gust of wind, but I don't feel any movement in the air. I look at my friend, and he had fallen down. He later told me what he saw was me talking to him and not paying attention, and then suddenly I'm in a different position, snatching the ball perpendicular to its course.

The day before we moved to a new state, I slept at my cousin's house. I was talking to him about the magic properties of my pick, and then left in a rush the next morning since I had overslept. I am 100% positive I forgot it on his bedroom floor. We moved 300 miles away, and they never visited our house, but around a year later, my sister found it on the floor of my mother's car. The car she'd bought *after* we moved. 

A few years later, I moved out. Couldn't find my pick while I was packing up all my stuff, or while unpacking. 7 months later, my roommate found it behind my mini fridge.

Knowing it's empty, he can draw it when he needs it and pull the slide back in less than a second, but a bounty that gets lucky and pulls it from the holster is going to pull the trigger first and take few moments to figure out why the owner isn't dead. Valuable seconds that the hunter can use to incapacitate him.

UnethicalLifeProTips,fdl24l8,t1_fdkfedu,1578515747.0,"> I'm calling for soldiers to grow a brain and refuse to fight in wars for political and corporate interests. 

You can't just refuse to go. You can refuse an order if it's to commit a war crime, but being ordered to go does not fall under that. If you're in the service and they tell you to go, you're going. And people enlist for other reasons than to fight. Some have no other way to move forward in life, some were lied to by recruiters or misinformed by media and felt obligated to serve. A LOT of people don't know that prior terrorist attacks were instigated by decades of western influence, so things like 9/11 would seem unprovoked to them.

I will agree with you on the point that people choosing to sign up now, at least specifically to go fight in Iran, are in the wrong. But you're painting with a broad brush, a lot of my friends served because they didn't feel like anything else suited them, or so they could get experience and an education.

Dooku didn't leave the order until he learned of Qui-Gon's death. So Maul was already ""dead"" at this point, and Sidious took him on somewhere in the decade between I and II.
