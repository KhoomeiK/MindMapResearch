dogs,feat4xc,t1_fea6gfc,1578951978.0,"Yes he has been. He’s been pinned by a German Shepard before at around 10 months old because of the way he was behaving. I’ve socialized him since a really young age. Taking him to dog parks, puppy play dates, etc. he started the bouncing and barking as a puppy towards other dogs, and I noticed a couple of times where it became obsessive to one dog specifically when he did it. I would interrupt him when he did that and remove him but just now when he’s over a year old has it turned into a refusal to back down to other dogs when it escalates. And he doesn’t try to mount them it’s the opposite once he gets there attention, he’s usually the one running away, but he will stand his ground and snarl/bark."
