I just got tired of him hopping in there and knocking all the shit over multiple times a night. He won it lol. Except the kicker is now he doesn’t go in it after the few times he explored the spot."

I would presume the Obama administration (and any previous admin) was made aware of US citizens that are in jails overseas (could be wrong) even if he wasn’t sent a letter. 

And it’s not like Trump told the dude to go on a hunger strike. 

Pinning everything shitty on Trump regardless  of if he is at fault is a dumb move. We need to oppose him on his actual bullshit, not some made up rhetoric."

In Michigan, if there is not a physical barrier separating the two directions, you stop while the bus stop sign is out and lights are flashing.
