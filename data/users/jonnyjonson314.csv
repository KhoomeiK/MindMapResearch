Socialist economic policies can certainly fit under libertarian ideologies. Regulations can be looked at as protections. Protecting a citizen from a toxic environment is definitively the government's job. Providing services to people also falls under that umbrella term, and increasing taxes to do so is a given. 

Libertarianism doesn't have to be right wing conservatism lite, it is a far wider range of things.

BTW the student loans one is definitely going to be controversial, and I can understand why that one might not for for most, but no one gets their full desires in a candidate.

Libertarian,fgig5gt,t1_fgi8k5s,1580820579.0,"There are consequences to any option, I would agree the incurred risk to small businesses could be dangerous, but. On the other hand, it would give more power to more people as far as job choice goes, and it would empower people to say no to shit jobs. We are already close enough to full employment that losing a few percent couldn't hurt. If an employer can't afford to properly pay people is it a worthwhile establishment? I'd say no, and I think it would take a little getting used to but I also think it's immoral to pay someone less than a living wage.

I would however personally prefer a more elegant solution then a raised minimum wage, as with inflation we will just revert back to where we were, and it doesn't help citizens equally as some areas a living wage could be less then 15$ and other more. Really what we want is to empower the lowest rung in the employment chain to have a voice. Not enough to change the whole system, but enough to keep themselves from being abused. 

As far as taxation being theft, that is a extremist ideology and I don't subscribe to it. There are lots of things I want from the government, and it's illogical to think they can do them without money. I appreciate many of the services they offer. Roads, schools, public services, care for the less fortunate, and plenty of other things. I do about that a good portion of that money is often miss manage, and we could do more to fix that."

I already told you plenty is reasons why recognizing privileges is important, but specifically in your scenario it isn't that important because you're not white. You didn't have those privileges so you know better then others what it can be like to be racially profiled. Honestly white privilege isn't as big of a deal and there are plenty of people act like it matters a lot, when really it isn't. It exists, but what does it mean to me?

To me white privilege is just something I recognize was a afforded to me and that I shouldn't take for granted. That's it. I think it's shitty of people to think that they aren't afforded advantages in life. Such as my privilege of financial stability. So yeah it bothers me when people try to act like that doesn't exist, because it feels like you're trying to say that everyone is on equal footing.

Just as bringing up crime statistics (as long as the situation calls for it) isn't racist recognizing privileges isn't racist.

Now back to the initial point of people trying to deny and argue that, complaining it's racist to say such things, are fragile people who can't accept that even if their life isn't good now that they have been afforded some advantages over others. So it is a fragility that specifically relates to their privileges being recognized. So white fragility isn't a great game for it, but it is a form of fragility that relates often to how they identify themselves. I still don't see anything racist about that."

I had been buying the pass every season with last seasons rewards, but this season I likely won't.

It's about empathizing with those around you, which seems like something you are actively trying to avoid. 

Everyone has specific privileges and an important step to help better yourself and those around you is to recognize your privileges.

For example one privilege I have had is having a caring family with a strong financial safety net that I could trust was there for me if things went wrong. By recognizing that I can start to understand the stress those around me who worry about money much more then I still are going through. This would be very difficult if I ignored this fact. 

I'll reiterate again that recognizing these privileges is all people are looking for. You don't have to DO anything. I'm not saying it's bad that these have existed, but they DO exist."
SelfAwarewolves,fencjxd,t1_fena87u,1579281779.0,"It's easy to win an argument against a straw man isn't it. I never said white privilege is always happening everywhere. It has always been situational as you said. It is a fact tho, no matter how much you try to deny it. How about we call it in group prejudice privilege? Those who are part of the same group will prejudice towards each other, and then it has nothing to do with race. It does however become about race when the in group decides they want to make it such. 

Basically this means when racists hold power they have control over who else gets it, and historically racists held power and did exactly that. I don't think I even need to quote history to prove that but since you seem to think there isn't any scientific backing to what I'm saying I will.

https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/reports/2018/02/21/447051/systematic-inequality/

Now, admitting white privilege exists doesn't mean white people have it well off, it just means that statistically they have better chances. Most people are struggling as the economy is shit right now, and just being a little better then your neighbor doesn't make either of your situations good, but if we can't help each other we'll never get out of this situation. It's not so much about trying to put white people down for being better off, but recognizing that those who aren't white are at a disadvantage, honestly there isn't a whole lot of action desired. It's almost exclusively about recognition. I don't think programs things like reparations or affirmative action are good, but I do think that if we act like there isn't an imbalance then we are ignoring those who are hurt by it"

I was explaining how they are culturally used, and why that is the case. Where as you are using statistics to make things look bad.

If anything that statistic says something about the biased policing of our country.

With this framing it's easier to understand why they are looked at so differently. White fragilities are looking at people who self identify as white being upset about their in group being mentioned. Saying that there are advantages to being white shouldn't cause problem because it's a fact, and if you get upset about it, it is because you are fragile.

SelfAwarewolves,fejex9j,t1_feio1il,1579170833.0,"I think he was trying to say that white people don't get judged based on their skin color very often. That's a privilege that is pretty exclusive to white people in many areas, and that's all people are trying to voice. 

Just because you haven't seen many problems that doesn't mean they don't exist, and it's hard to know what problems there are when you were of the color of skin that gets discriminated against least.

Acknowledging white privilege isn't able doing anything, but understanding the plight of those around you. That's why it's kinda crazy when people want to argue it. Because it's very likely not even as big as you think we are saying it is, but the point is just to acknowledge it is a problem for some. This isn't some giant campaign, just a simple idea that everyone should understand.

It's not always the systematic oppression of one specific race like with blacks in America. It can be as simple as having a hard time being recognized as a sushi chef because you're not Asian. Which could be an example of being judge for being white, because it does happen to white people, but it doesn't happen as often as with other colors of skin."
MagicArena,fegvbpe,t3_eon97r,1579103348.0,"They have been getting extremely shitty with their event management. I can't see myself stopping playing the game, as I enjoy standard and draft so much, and it's a free way to do both a lot. However, I would love to get into historic or brawl, but there are literal costs to playing them. 

First I have to play wildcards to build decks, then I have to pay to enter events, and what's my reward for all this commitment, 3k xp, which gets me 3 uncommons, passing 10k gold for 3 random uncommons and ""the pleasure of taking part in a different format"" feels like a fucking slap in the face."

I feel I have gotten by just fine accepting that nothing will ever be known for sure. The only thing I have faith in is my friends and family. There is evidence on both sides, but as there isn't enough to prove one way or another, I choose to not make any assumptions as that way I wont be wrong.
