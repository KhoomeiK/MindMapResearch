Right now the only one paying for the effects of the dumped fuel are the taxpayers who paid the firefighters to triage and clean the unfortunate folks caught in the dump.

facepalm,fesdx9t,t1_fes9l9a,1579364187.0,"Fair enough.  Although I never stated those things so you wouldn’t be disagreeing with my post. 

I had thought the apostle John had a fairly decent timeline and have little trouble accepting tradition that the man, likely named John, who was the  basis of the character the apostle John did indeed have a very direct relationship to the book John and revelation.  

Doing a bit of research after your post it does seem that John is unlikely to have been written by the character the apostle John given its likely date, though the idea it was written all at once still seems silly to me. 

I wasn’t aware there were multiple John’s that the church tradition supposes are the same person but unsure if they were.   If anything it does make it more likely the gospel of John was written by someone named John whoever he was."

facepalm,fes3weu,t1_ferv5om,1579361126.0,"Traditionally John is thought to have lived to an old age and been the author of revelation.   Peter has some letters to the church that are part of the New Testament.  

Biblical scholars normally view the gospels as four versions of a story, with details added or removed.  Aside from John there is a clear evolutionary path for them, and there is a proposed lost Q gospel that is the proto gospel to John and whichever of the others came first.  (This is all from memory so sorry if I have some details wrong). 

The introduction to Luke clearly states there are lots of gospels being made.  It says it is the account of one who has been involved and investigated from the start.  It implies a need for such ordered investigated accountings because there are lots of witnesses and non witnesses telling what happened and the tale is growing and becoming confused.  

The other two do not clearly state a purpose or explanation for where they come from, though Mathew starting with the lineage of Mary and Joesph seems like it’d be geared toward Hebrews who might care about that sort of thing. 

Pre printing press records of major events are very different than modern equivalents.   I believe Mathew and Mark are well polished accounts, probably assembled by scribes from sources that were dictated that are attributed to, though not necessarily dictated by the authors.  John seems like John.  It’s weird and philosophical and interesting.  I don’t doubt it’s source much.  Luke is plain for what it is, an ordered retelling of various accounts assembled by someone who investigated into the history of events.  If it is the apostle Luke, then he also had some first hand knowledge of it he could cross check things against. 

The pastor’s comment is pretty silly, as if he believes it he’d have no right to say it as worded.   I’m hoping he meant spreading rumors is unhelpful, or that speaking in authority of something you haven’t verified is the same as providing a false witness.  

I really feel strongly about the last point because news sources often report false information someone else said with an accurate attribution, which leads to deceiving their audience that the information is true when only the fact someone said that the false information was true is true.  

Or they will present true but unrelated facts in a way that leads the audience to finding false conclusions reasonable.  

On one hand the reader should be wise to these facts and owns the results of their deception, but that doesn’t excuse people in positions of authority, be it news agencies or pastors, that practice deceptive practices and become false witnesses.  And I believe it is totally valid to shame them for this kind of abhorrent behavior.
