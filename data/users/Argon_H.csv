IsekaiQuartet,fcmmwzs,t1_f6osbt7,1577782163.0,"My name is Tanya. I'm 9 years old. My house is in the northeast section of the empire where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the empire as a mage, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink coffee. 

I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. 

I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."
