Everyone, from the guy who just started to the guy who's been in for more that 30 years and hit his top-out pay back when he was in his 20's."

Bernie is a wonderful dude and I hope he gets the nomination, but I can't stand some of his more extreme online supporters who say Yang's methods and ideas are ""too soft"" and that ""the time for being nice to the corporate fatcats is over"", or that ""playing nice and keeping capitalism got us in this mess in the first place"" the list goes on. The best is when they say that ""You can't fix capitalism"", and that we should just throw it out and go full DemSoc."
