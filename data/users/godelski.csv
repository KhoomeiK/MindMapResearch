vim,ff8m3j8,t1_ff8hvjj,1579685266.0,"Documentation I use splits, not tabs. Think about it this way, lots of time you have the terminal on one monitor and Google/DDG/Stack on the other. You want these side by side since you need to reference. That's what buffers/panes are for. When you don't need side by side material, tabs are handy. But of course, too many tabs becomes cumbersome. But its more difficult to have too many buffers. 

Tabs  are different working areas. You're not referencing things there. Or maybe you are, but each tab you're referencing a different documentation. That's where it comes in handy. 

So here's an example of my workflow. I'm writing some code and in my main file I'm pulling a bunch of functions from my utility file. I have the utility file in a vertical split and folded so I can see the function calls. I can then easily remember all my functions as I'm writing my main and get the correct arguments. But in another file I need to write some other helper functions. These are calling a different library. There I'm again splitting but referencing different material. This is just a possible setup you might have. These two tabs are different work areas.

So I'm doing a PhD and work in a HPC environment. I can tell you that you usually don't need that powerful of hardware to code. Too powerful of hardware will actually help you be lazy. That being said, if you're planning on doing ML and get real serious with it then that's a different issue. You can do a lot on a 1080 Ti (memory is important). But you can also do a fair amount with a 1050. More than enough to create projects on your github that'll put you above the pack. 

Games on the other hand are different and a good excuse. 

>I'm also looking to dabble a bit in game development

On one hand I want to encourage you to stay on linux to do this (we need more games that are platform independent! Performance can be higher on linux). But most companies are deeply embedded in the windows environment and learning their tools will give you a better leg up. BUT regardless, your skills will translate so don't let this be a killer. 

>my plan is to jump straight to a computer science associates degree

I'm not sure how worthwhile this is. There's two good options I see. 1) Make your GitHub attractive and just apply to jobs or freelance (continue to?). 2) Try to get into a school with a good reputation. Find one where professors have good connections. Skill is important, but don't underestimate networking.

Then don't go linux (I use Arch btw @[CaptainJackNarrow](https://www.reddit.com/user/CaptainJackNarrow/)). While support has been growing most of these games are not going to run at native resolutions. If you are okay with the selection that there is, then go linux all the way!

That being said, you say you are doing computer science (in high school! Awesome!). Go linux! Linux just makes development so much easier. So maybe you want a dual boot? Windows for games, linux for everything else? [Distro Watch](https://distrowatch.com/) keeps a list of the most popular operating systems out there. I generally use Manjaro (sorry, I lied about Arch, but I lived in it for 10 years. I need me some pacman). Manjaro is nice because you get pacman but don't have to deal with rolling releases so you have a stable system (you can change how stable fairly easily). I'm not familiar with MX, but I do like Debian systems. Mint is also extremely user friendly. Those top 10 will almost always do you good.   


But we have to find out what your goals are. If you're really trying to understand linux, you should actually use Arch or Gentoo (maybe not on your main machine). You're forced to learn the linux way on these systems and it is trial by fire. Everyone I've seen follow this advice fails their first few installs BUT when they finally get it they end up being well ahead of the curve. The other advice I give to people is ""don't leave the shell"". Use GUIs when you know the shell. Sometimes the GUI is more efficient, but usually the shell is better.

You're right that old reactors are already safe enough, but that's not the point I was making. I was trying to say that all these benefits that people are touting about Thorium can also be used with Uranium, in most cases. There is a difference in that Thorium has less long life highly radioactive material (which we should strive for as little as possible even though we don't already produce that much), but does come at a cost of lower power. This isn't that bad of a trade though.

YangForPresidentHQ,fdivrla,t3_ele583,1578452141.0,"I used to work as a radiation scientist (and I have friends and colleagues that working in fission and fusion), doing contract work for a certain agency that deals with those kinds of things (gov likes you to not say where you work/ed for because they don't want personal opinions to be agency opinions). So I want to be clear about something. A lot of talk about Thorium feels like it is coming from zealots or armchair scientists. This is not conducive to convincing people to be pro nuclear (which I do believe is essential). I think, and have experienced, that this is a different type of group. So I do want to lay down some nuance. This is Reddit, not a classroom, so it is still high level and I'm skipping stuff (we can try to get into specifics if you want though: see end). 

People tend to talk up Thorium because (I'm literally pulling from the first thing I googled): It eliminates the threat of nuclear weapon proliferation, plentiful supply, eliminates nuclear waste, and higher safety. These match with what I hear people frequently talking about, but you'll get puzzled looks if you say these things to a nuclear scientist. 

Proliferation: We can actually do this with Uranium. That's actually a big part of the Iran deal and why it was important. The short story is that to create weapons you need a lot of U235 and for reactors you don't. U235 needs to be enriched. And there's a big cost/size of facility required difference to generating weapons amount of enriched uranium vs reactor levels. (There was A LOT more to the Iran deal than this btw).

But you're all probably thinking transuranic elements like plutonium. The thorium cycle makes these materials as well, just in lower quantities. But we can do the same thing with uranium. Not that that matters though, because it is about the quantities that you produce and if we think of reactors as an enrichment plant, in this case, we have very different yields in energy and what the plant looks like. So there's an important distinction there. Additionally, transuranic elements have other use cases. RTGs are a great example (especially for you space lovers) as well as medicine. Oak Ridge produces a lot of nuclear materials for medical research. They also do cool neutron stuff there.

Plentiful supply: We're not in danger of running out of uranium. Like anytime soon. Like so much that even though fusion is always 20 years away it would be embarrassing if we aren't using fusion by the time we finish half the supply. 

Waste: There's an interesting story here, that I won't get into because it is political. But there's two big parts to this. 1) [17% of France's energy](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/france.aspx) comes from recycled nuclear waste. I think you read that wrong. I didn't say 17% of France's nuclear energy, I mean ALL of France's energy. Their waste output is dramatically lower than the US and most other countries because of how they handle the waste. Part of this is the benefit of scaling though. 2) Generation of reactors matter. Unsurprisingly, new reactors are more efficient. But we're not at gen 4 and there isn't a conspiracy to why we aren't building them in production. They just aren't there yet. 

3) (I know I said 2) waste isn't as big of a deal as you'd think. What do you do with it? I'm dead serious here, you stick it in a fucking hole in the ground. This is what we do with waste from every single energy source we have, and doing this with nuclear tends to be safer than with other materials simply because quantities matter. Not all nuclear waste is the same. 97% of waste accounts for 1% of the radioactivity. 1% of waste accounts for 95% of radioactivity. We're talking less than a coke can per person per year for high level radiation. Compared to coal, which is train cars per person per day. This is actually why per kWhr nuclear has one of the lowest waste yields of any form of energy (see the IPCC papers). It's deadly stuff, but there isn't much and we get a ton of energy.

Safety: There's something I commonly hear. ""We've had an accident every 20 years with reactors"". It is pretty disingenuous to say though. There's been 3 major accidents. Chernobyl (est 4k people died, including future predictions of cancer deaths), Fukushima (1 death from a worker in the cleanup, lung cancer), 3 Mile Island (0 deaths). Consider that Chernobyl was extremely early in the technology and was a known bad reactor design (no one else but Russia has ever used a positive void reactor btw). Part 2 is that radiation dosage limits are set extremely conservatively (I 100% agree with this decision btw!). There's a reason death per kWhr beats solar and wind (mostly people falling). Go to a nuclear power plant, they run a really tight ship. 

I'm not opposed to thorium, I'm actually in favor of them. But we need honest discussions about things to have serious discussions. Exaggerating things just gives the opposition more counter points and allows arguments to be easily dismissed. We also all know that nuclear is an extremely difficult field. I have a degree in physics and worked as a radiation scientist and I won't call myself a nuclear expert, it is that complicated. It is okay to not be an expert though, specialization is a fantastic thing! Personally I'd rather people be honest and just say ""Hey, I don't understand it all, but this is what I hear the experts saying."" I think that's how we win people over. Honesty and knowing your limits. You can still appeal to logos by appealing to ethos. Let the experts make the bold claims. This is actually why I like Yang. He's willing to back down when an expert steps in and says he's wrong. Then Yang goes on a hunt and gets the consensus. Changing your mind when presented new evidence is something we should all emulate and applaud. That's the kind of president we need."

But if you're going to call something scientific your pet peeve, there needs to be more credentials than internet warrior. Your language and sourcing do not give me confidence that you are anything but.

I do encourage you to go to climate talks at your local university. They tend to be quite common. Talk to those people there. Get away from the internet. Ask those people your hard questions.

And for the love of god, please read papers and sources that are against what you believe. This is extremely important in the scientific process.

YangForPresidentHQ,fcvnmr0,t1_fcvbeuu,1578005994.0,"I'm not an energy expert, but I do work with/at energy labs (and even dated someone that was building next gen batteries). My background has been physics, with a focus on radiation and space tech and I've moved into scientific visualization. So my battery background is systems designing for rockets/satellites and what those friends and ex have told me (and of course, lots of reading). 

Energy density is just a good metric to use, but you're right that it doesn't convey everything. But let's look at it, to clear some things up. Energy density is measured as J/m^(3), or kg/(m s^(2)) (J = kg m^(2) s^(-2) \-- we can also convert to BTU if you want to read those charts from LLNL that I linked). So you can probably see here that if we move units around we can get weight (from the mass, kg), volume (m^(3)), and the total energy stored (J). But the energy per volume is actually one of the things we care about the most. This can even include an airplane (or ... satellite, but satellites we care about volume as well, now that we're trying to shrink them. But mass is still more important than volume). The reasoning is because if we have something that is very heavy but has a high energy density, then we can just use less of it. 

For grid batteries energy density is important, but also cost, and other factors (like what is the max draw rate you can do before the battery explodes or lights on fire? This is actually a problem with LiPos. What is the response time? Stability in storage? Etc.). If you only look at one of these you're missing the nuance of what's going on. If you just focus on cost, this might be fine for somewhere like Nevada where there's a lot of open land that isn't really usable. If you don't include max draw rates then you are going to build unsafe batteries in somewhere like the grapevine, and light the surrounding fields on fire. If you don't consider density, then you can't get enough storage into dense areas like NYC or LA. 

Something that is missed in the public discussion, and sometimes in the theoretical discussions (but this isn't super common), is that this is not a one size fits all problem. If you do any engineering you'll realize that there is good reason for there being thousands of different types of screws. Each has their own purpose. The same is true about solving climate change. There's no simple solutions. **Anyone saying so is selling something**. This challenge is going to require a well diversified portfolio of solutions: many different ways to generate power, different ways to store it, different ways to sequester, different methods to solve transportation (like making vehicles more efficient, autonomous driving, better public transport, better telecommuting to reduce long distance traveling, etc), and so on. This is not an easy to solve problem and we are nowhere near solving it."
