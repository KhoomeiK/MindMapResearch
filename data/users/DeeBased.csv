venturebros,ffd4rfb,t1_ff8e1r5,1579813400.0,Exceptional analysis - especially liked the reference to the Killinger scene.
TheBlackList,ff8dci4,t3_erzzt2,1579673794.0,I firmly believe Meghan Boone did something to piss the writers off and they've been punishing her ever since.
venturebros,ff8czmp,t1_ff869fp,1579673415.0,"I agree. Just finished binging it. There were apparently plans to  make a full length TV movie, and the creator has finished two drafts but wasn't satisfied with them and might be working on a third."
SIBO,ff83pia,t1_ff7x3h2,1579665163.0,"Perfect. Thanks again for the info.

I did it once and felt improvement, but had a hard time cutting out sugar. I'd like to give it another try."
SIBO,ff6noru,t1_fey8cj2,1579631079.0,Thanks for your response. Can I also ask what your daily dosage was?
MGTOW,ff6n7k3,t1_ff6mv4l,1579630787.0,You're welcome. Feel free to DM me if you hit a rough patch and need to talk.
MGTOW,ff6komx,t1_ff685pq,1579629254.0,"Congratulations on 21 days, man!

If it helps, I'm sober 30 years and every time I wanted a drink, I thought back to and felt the feelings I had at my very lowest point, then thought ""This drink I want will take me right back there."" It took about 3 months, but then the cravings passed."
MGTOW,ff36rzq,t1_ff33ky2,1579535036.0,"I attended an addiction based recovery meeting in a treatement center in a slightly shady neighborhood the other day, and it struck me that even though all these men were close to or had been homeless, struggling and in fairly dire circumstances, they were all laughing and joking with each other and there was a sense of camaraderie even in this situation. 

You can bet if it was all women that would've been an entirely different scene."
todayilearned,ff35vwc,t3_equ0ve,1579534422.0,"Fun fact: Mitt Romney drove Blockbuster out of existence. 

It wasn't actually the advent of streaming, it was the massive debt that Bain Capital saddled them with when they acquired them. Same thing happened with Toys R Us."
television,ff355jy,t3_er0vvi,1579533923.0,"I loved it on a rewatch. It's a very charming show, very character driven. 

One odd thing is that the main actor (Rob Morrow) asked for more money after the show was renewed. The storyline had been ""Doc Hollywood"" fish out of water and the doctor was gradually becoming part of the community, but then the writing staff suddenly made all the other characters hate him. It's a very obvious, jarring tonal shift in the show and they wrote that on purpose to try to poison his character so people would accept Anthony Edwards replacing him.

Still very much worth a watch."
SIBO,fexxisd,t1_fevsfqg,1579437948.0,Can I ask how long you took the allicin max? Was it for four to six months?

television,feljwjj,t3_epndfb,1579223950.0,"I think maybe it got a cold reception because it's from SNL, and a lot of their prior movies hadn't done well (Coneheads, The Ladies Man, Stuart, etc). It had me howling with laughter. That shit is funny!"
todayilearned,fej10p4,t1_feimc1r,1579153048.0,"I love that movie! Very pleasantly surprised when I watched it. Primarily kind of a neo-noire, but with a light-hearted tone, occasional humor, Elvis impersonators, mystery and some gorgeous sun drenched scenery.

Guitar,fegy2nt,t3_eoyxfh,1579105086.0,"Focus on the problem part. I used to do it the other way around and finally realized I was spending say, 3 minutes over and over and over again to perfect the 10 second part that I was having issues with. Once I focused on the problem part, things went so much more quickly and I experienced less frustration to boot."

One came over to the fence where I was, and A) it was much taller than I expected (at least 6 foot), and B) it was scary as hell, I was real glad there were wrought iron bars between us!

venturebros,fecwbnq,t3_eo0x8i,1578987197.0,"That is very ... insightful. The Monarch does have A LOT of screen time, and I'm really glad he does. His story arcs are just ridiculously entertaining.

One of my favorite scenes is at the Yard Sale, where he and Dr. Girlfriend are in the midst of all these bad-ass super villains, but are being mischievous and set up a bet to see if he can get Brock to help him search for his contact lens. It's just adds to the charm of their relationship that they have goofy fun together like that."
conspiracy,fece3li,t1_fec7foh,1578971729.0,"And - all the security cameras in the tunnel where the crash occurred were mysteriously shut off at the time, the paparazzi were generally blamed, although their cars were all far behind Dianna's, while a white car and several motorcycles were crowding her car and were found in a court of law to be guilty of manslaughter, but no one ever found out who was driving those cars. MI6 absurdly claimed to have never killed anyone in 50 years...although they had documented plans to kill a foreign national by blinding his driver with a high powered strobe light IN A TUNNEL, exactly the way Dianna's accident occurred...with witnesses seeing a bright flash seconds before the crash..."

MGTOW,fdsi8hm,t1_fds9zuc,1578703244.0,"I feel bad for him, too. He blames (and kind of rightfully so) the paparazzi for literally hounding his mother to her death. He said that every time - every single time - he hears a camera flash it reminds him how his Mother died."
MGTOW,fds8gwj,t3_emu06d,1578696741.0,"They just got married in 2018, and already:

* Rumors that she and the royal sister in law (future Queen) are feuding   
* Rumors Harry & William not getting along (because of wives feud?)    
* Leaving Britain because of Meghan's unfair treatment in the press    
* After much reflection, ""they"" decided to transition away from royal life

Harry has money that he inherited from Diana (up to $16m, supposedly). But if there's a divorce he could potentially lose half or more of that, and leaving behind his royal duties means giving up all the money he gets annually from the royal family. Don't see how this marriage benefits him AT ALL."

MGTOW,fdh4b07,t3_elb953,1578415078.0,"Multi-tasking is a myth. They've done studies which prove that it takes a person a set amount of time to re-focus their brain on a new task after switching from a previous task. Each time a person starts a new task there is downtime while their brain re-focuses.

So multi-tasking is actually the LEAST effective way to accomplish anything."

I love how the characters progressed over the seasons and the relationship episodes (Mordecai and Margaret and C.J. and Eileen and Rigby) were my favorites. Rigby going back to school was a favorite as well. For a lot of shows, just rebooting the show in outer space would be a jump the shark moment, but for The Regular Show it was natural and ....
