"" The System is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.""

LateStageCapitalism,ffe3bj4,t1_ffdzfws,1579835601.0,Warren was a Republican for most of her career and Biden has done the same corporate bootlicking and safety net erosions as Republicans for decades. The only true hopeful candidate that gives us a future is Bernie at this point. Yang doesnt have the numbers. Tulsi is out. Bernie or bust at this point. The others might not be trump but they will not get what the people NEED accomplished and well end up either losing outright to trump or getting half assed promises of mediocre shit done if at all. Dont be fooled by corporate sponsored Democrats their not much better than Republicans if their still putting corporate interest above the people.

But they're saying Theres 25 different arsonist intentionally setting fire to their own shit.. this info was coincidentally found right after everyone the PM met with refused to shake his hand and swore at him on TV. This is PR damage control. similar to the police chief who nabs the crazy guy as the killer just because he confessed but clearly isn't the culprit. It's easier to blame all the fires on some BS reason that sounds good.  instead of lack of prep from himself and his gov and admitting climate change is a factor. Dont forget his job is literally to provide the illusion that all that fire shit is under control.. that everything is under control. Your going to see a lot more of this as climate change start to spiral away from our grasp more and more.

The tariffs have ruined farmers and the economy they sell their crop into.  Were paying for all the tariff increases further weakening the economy. The stock market is the only thing doing ""well"" and this is also full of false optimism and the fed loading it with billions each month to keep it afloat.

But they're saying Theres 25 different arsonist intentionally setting fire to their own shit.. this info was coincidentally found right after everyone the PM met with refused to shake his hand and swore at him on TV. This is PR damage control. similar to the police chief who nabs the crazy guy as the killer just because he confessed but clearly isn't the culprit. It's easier to blame all the fires on some BS reason that sounds good.  instead of lack of prep from himself and his gov and admitting climate change is a factor. Dont forget his job is literally to provide the illusion that all that fire shit is under control.. that everything is under control. Your going to see a lot more of this as climate change start to spiral away from our grasp more and more.
