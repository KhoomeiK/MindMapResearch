AskWomenOver30,ff8croz,t3_es4vcp,1579673182.0,"Tell him that equal division of chores is important to you and it’s only fair. 
I’d make a chore chart that you both agree on. Decide how many days you have to get it done. This way it’s clear to him what needs to be done and you longer have to be the “nag” that he’s not listening to anyway. Maybe their are consequences if you don’t do the chores like paying $25 into a pot or something."

TrueOffMyChest,fc4ke1n,t3_efx1ut,1577419234.0,"Have you ever looked into seasonal work? Most resorts/parks need workers for their busy seasons. I moved from TN to WY to work in Grand Teton National Park with little money. They provided dorms, meals and on my days off I got to do all the activities the guests did. Half way through the season a ski resort came out looking for winter season employees, so I had a second job lined up right after the last. 
It might be worth looking into. Good luck!"
