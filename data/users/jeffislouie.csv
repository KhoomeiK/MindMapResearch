You drive a new car for a few years.  That's something

""For my investment""

Your car wasn't an investment.  An investment is something you hope nets you a return.

Now, you have to understand what you pay for with a lease.  You pay rent on a car.  You typically buy the depreciation (give or take).  The big advantages for leases are:

1) you typically drive more car than you can afford to buy
2) you lease a brand new car covered by a warranty
3) your payments are typically lower than they would be if you bought
4) if you have a business and run your lease through that business, you can pay in pre-tax dollars and write it off as an expense.

The answer is it depends.

I've bought and leased dozens of cars.  If you have a car you like, and you keep liking it long term, and it is reliable, a buy is a good choice.  At the end of your note, you own the car, which has some value.

I just leased a new vehicle after buying and eventually selling a certified pre-owned luxury car just as the cpo warranty was set to expire.

I could have leased a car that wasn't quite as nice that I liked for a little less, but chose to buy the one I ended up with because I really liked it.

I always do some math to help weigh my options.

Here is exactly the math I did when I chose to buy.

First, the lease option: 450 a month for 36 months with $2000 down.  Total payments 16,200 plus the 2000, or 18,200.

Now the buy option: 576 a month for 48, with $0 down.  Total payments were $27,648.
At the end of the loan, I figured my car would be worth 12,000.  So end of loan, I'd own the car.  27,648-12,000= 15,648.

Here's how it actually worked out.  I owned the car for 35 months.  I sold it for 10,500 (could have gotten more like 13,000 if I sold it myself instead of to a dealer).
I paid out 20,160.  I owed 7975 on the car.  I ended up with a check for $2525.
So I paid out 20,760-2525= 18235.

So on the buy, I made $35 versus the lease.
Is that worth me worrying about?  Not even a little bit.  Clearly, had I held onto the car and paid it off, I could have driven it for no monthly payment until I decided to sell it and might have pocketed more money or just enjoyed having no monthly until I dumped it, but I got a deal that my trusted lease guy (family friend through which my family and our businesses has leased at least two dozen vehicles) told me he couldn't get close to.  As a matter of fact, he said ""go get this deal.  I have no idea how they are doing it, but if the paperwork is right, they are taking a bath."" (FYI, they took a huge bath and lost a fortune).

Obviously, your numbers will vary.  I also purchased the car through my business and depreciated the value, so in the end, I came out pretty well.

When I sold my fancy cpo, I did it to get into a lease.  My business will pay this.  My payments went from $576 to $393.  That extra $183 a month I'm saving is extra profit, which means an extra 2196 a year in freed up capital.

Every situation is different, but your car is a depreciating asset (unless you are buying a gullwing Mercedes or something collectable).  Buying is great if you want the flexibility to get out at any time or plan on keeping the car for a long time etc.  Leasing is better if you want more car for less money, want to drive a new car every few years, want a warranty, have a business, etc."

Call *your* insurance company.  If they determine it is the other person's fault (and they should), they will deal with the other person's insurance for you and get your claim paid.

You have an obligation to work with your insurance provider.  The other person's insurance company has an obligation to minimize the payout.  You are not equipped to deal with this yourself.  

Unless it's your fault and the damage is less than your deductible, always go through your own insurance.  If it is your fault and under your deductible, if you can pay it out of pocket, it makes sense to keep it off of your insurance.  Heck, if it is more than your deductible by a few hundred and you can afford it, it pays to keep it off your insurance.

Your insurance company will not raise your rates based on a claim where fault is attributed to another with insurance.

The best part of this is that it makes your life easier.

If your insurance company tells you to call the other person's carrier, follow their direction.  There are a lot of substandard insurers out there.

I was rear ended by someone driving a work van.  I called the company to get the insurance info on the street and the owner just started swearing at me and calling me a liar.  I took all of the info down at the scene and headed to the local pd to file a report.  The officer told me to call again.  Same deal, owner screaming and swearing at me.  I put the Sargeant on the phone and the owner treated him the same.
