ChronicPain,fesb8jr,t3_eq7kt7,1579363429.0,"Hospice nurse. In my many years of practice, I've never had a patient abuse her or his pain medicine. That's thousands of patients. The reason is that I always start at a low dose, and titrate up to the lowest dose that controls the pain. The lowest analgesic dose is rarely high enough to produce euphoria. No euphoria, no abuse. If you find that the dose you need to control pain does produce euphoria, try adding a nonopioid analgesic and back off on the opioid a bit. The most common type of pain that doesn't respond well to opioids is bone pain. Add an NSAID or a steroid such as dexamethasone to complement the opioid. For stubborn neurogenic pain add gabapentin or amitriptyline (Elavil). For unacceptable opioid sedation, try a low morning dose of Ritalin or Adderal to clear away the cobwebs. Good luck getting a doc to order it though. I'm not especially opposed to the pursuit of euphoria in principle; just the use of opioids to get it. Opioids are dangerous at doses that are high enough to get you high. If you're taking opioids for chronic pain, then you have enough problems without injuring yourself with an overdose. Seriously, don't risk it. That shit is stronger than you."

The concentration of carbon dioxide in the air has more than doubled in the past one hundred fifty years. The amount of carbon it takes to effect that change is equal to the amount of fossil fuel people have burned. The air is warming measurably, glaciers are receding, sea level is rising, and weather patterns are changing all over the world. The science community insists that things are going to change much more, and that we have a moral duty to limit the change so as to protect future generations from an ecological catastrophe. People who were heavily invested in the fossil fuel part of the energy industry knew about the problem decades ago, and had an opportunity to adjust their portfolios so to benefit from a shift away from fossil fuels. They chose instead to bury the story, and adopted the tobacco industry's approach of science denial and heavy handed political manipulation. They even went a step further, and undermined the role of morality in institutional decision making and political identity."
