Within one year we lost a 16 year old cat, an 18 year old, and the neighbor's old cat (she was probably 12 years old). We also lost our great Dane last year, who was 10. It was hard, and because we went back for Dobby, it was easier because he was such a comfort to all of us."

I called my husband, told him what happened, he said, ""absolutely not! We have FIVE CATS INSIDE ALREADY!"" So my kid and I came home. Kid refused to even speak to Dad. Dad felt bad, we said if the cat is still there, we'll bring it home. We pulled into the parking lot, my kid said, ""here kitty kitty,"" And Dobby came flying around the corner of the building and went straight to my son. My son picked him up, cuddled him, and put him in the carrier. We had 6 cats. ü§∑üòÇ"
