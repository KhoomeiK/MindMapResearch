blackcats,fdpbpod,t1_fdpbgik,1578624635.0,"We have lost a few over the years. We knew our 18 year old cat was fading fast. We also took in our neighbor's cat when the neighbor died, and Rosie the cat was elderly. Within one year we lost a 16 year old cat, an 18 year old, and the neighbor's old cat (she was probably 12 years old). We also lost our great Dane last year, who was 10. It was hard, and because we went back for Dobby, it was easier because he was such a comfort to all of us."
blackcats,fdp6s7x,t1_fdp69fd,1578621327.0,"Our youngest void, Dobby, crawled into my kid's lap at the *dermatologist's* office. My son sat down outside the entrance to see if the little cat was injured, and Dobby just *boop* crawled right in his lap, curled up, and went to sleep. I called my husband, told him what happened, he said, ""absolutely not! We have FIVE CATS INSIDE ALREADY!"" So my kid and I came home. Kid refused to even speak to Dad. Dad felt bad, we said if the cat is still there, we'll bring it home. We pulled into the parking lot, my kid said, ""here kitty kitty,"" And Dobby came flying around the corner of the building and went straight to my son. My son picked him up, cuddled him, and put him in the carrier. We had 6 cats. 🤷😂"
