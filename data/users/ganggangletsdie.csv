politics,ff9dcp3,t1_ff8na8n,1579710523.0,"So I did some googling and it appears both Lee and Grant inherited their slaves. 

> “Robert E.  Lee personally owned slaves that he inherited upon the death of his mother, Ann Lee, in 1829. (His son, Robert E. Lee Jr., gave the number as three or four families.) Following the death of his father-in-law, George Washington Parke Custis, in 1857, Lee assumed command of 189 enslaved people, working the estates of Arlington, White House, and Romancoke. Custis’ will stipulated that the enslaved people that the Lee family inherited be freed within five years.” [source ](https://acwm.org/blog/myths-misunderstandings-lee-slaveholder) 

> “Robert E. Lee owned slaves. He managed even more. When defied, he did not hesitate to use violence typical of the institution of slavery” from the same source. 

Interestingly enough, it’s not thought that Grant inherited his sole slave. 
> “How, when, and why Grant obtained a slave are all unknown, although Grant’s mentioning of Frederick Dent suggests that he most likely purchased Jones from his Father-in-law” [source](https://pastexplore.wordpress.com/2015/06/29/did-ulysses-s-grant-own-slaves-during-the-civil-war/) 

In my opinion, back in the civil war days (and this still applies today) most wealthy people were assholes. Lee and Grant both were. However, people nowadays are fabricating things from the past to fit their narrative today."
politics,ff85q7q,t1_ff7pw4y,1579666731.0,Okay but that’s not true at all. Michigan is more “1950s Deep South” than Virginia. Speaking from experience.
politics,ff85dsf,t1_ff7y6i6,1579666452.0,If I remember correctly the slaves he had were passed to him when his father passed away. I do remember seeing in a book that he was cruel to his slaves.

Michigan,ff4ebfj,t1_ff4dvvo,1579561576.0,That depends entirely on the company. Every single place I have worked you were not allowed to en accuse a person of stealing. Even if they did it right in front of you on camera.

politics,ff395wf,t1_ff2x358,1579536628.0,"I never said they weren’t everywhere. They’re just more prevalent in smaller rural towns. Yeah, racism happens everywhere. But Michigan is way more overt with their racism. I’m not saying that covert racism is better, all racism is bad, but it makes it hard when people say racist shit to your face. I’m white but I look like I could be mixed with Asian or Hispanic and the amount of racism I encountered in Michigan was far above anything I’ve experienced in 18 years of living in Virginia."
politics,ff2bizz,t1_ff28558,1579499704.0,"Having lived in rural Michigan and in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia, the most racist and hateful people I met were in rural Michigan. Lansing and Detroit weren’t as bad, but rural Michigan (and I mean bum fuck nowhere) were disgusting in the way they thought of women and anyone that isn’t white."
Awwducational,ff24rof,t1_ff24mkn,1579493788.0,"They use their sense of smell and sense of touch underground. I can imagine they have very good hearing as well. That doesn’t change suddenly when they go above ground. 

Just like a dead human or dog. The other senses compensate.

Edit: I think it’s pretty obvious I meant deaf but dead is funnier so imma leave it."

aww,fep08tu,t1_feowg8a,1579309241.0,"What if she slips out of the harness and had no identification? I’ve always kept my dogs collar on her while using a harness because if anything happens she’ll still have my contact info and any tags that are locally required. Another thing is if she slips out of the harness then it would be easier to catch her and attach a leash if she’s wearing a collar. 

Where I live, if your dog is caught running loose without identification or a rabies and distemper tag, you receive a fat fine. If you are in public without a rabies tag, you get a fine. 

Don’t be so quick to judge.

Edit: as for the harness, she may be a puller and this helps. It may also be easier for him to hold the leash from the front if she’s walking beside him."
