If you're having issues then remember it has settings for most known headphone models, and I mean that they have settings for pretty much every recent headphone in a particular brand. I have some old Senns and they didn't have my particular model but they had presets for about 20 different Sennheiser models so I picked the closest one which sounded best.

I think we all want to see Masvidal vs Usman, apart possibly from Usman because Masvidal looks as if he will give him a solid paggering.

Although I completely appreciated your ""self-interest"" argument I don't have complee distrust in the EU banking system.
I can't see how Brexit will divest us from the banking industry, it's the major facet of the country's economy, being one of the major financial centres on Earth. If anything, it will strengthen reliance upon it. I would be interested to see if there's any evidence to back up that claim. There's always a lot of talk about divestment after crashes to appease the short term anger, it always washes away with the latest scandal. the problem with our economy is that we don't manufacture anything of our own on a grand scale, and I don't see what we would get into. We do very high end engineering and science very well, and yes we can make vehicles, but as for other industries, given the subsidies necessary, and the competition we don't seem to want to do it. It's a tricky issue, but as our national debt increases, I can't see us doing away with the CoL.
