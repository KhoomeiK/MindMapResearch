The alternative is to continue like this for a few more years, worrying the whole time, until it becomes an even larger issue. Just ask him, knowledge is power."

aww,fd5d8ho,t1_fd5b5z9,1578176467.0,"Right? I get that we are having fun here but I still feel like words should mean things.

We shouldn't just say shit that isn't real just because it makes people say Aww and upvote.

It's a short step away from agreeing with other made up shit that you wish was true but actually isn't at all."

oddlysatisfying,fd252nw,t1_fd1gle5,1578141801.0,"No one argued that he poured it wrong. Go reread. He only said that the beer they used couldn't even make a head in the first place even in the worst possible condition which was pouring it like a jackass. There was no foam at all even though he just dumped it.

Go to literally any nerdy tee shirt site with rotating designs. This is literally their business models.

Or even etsy."
aww,fcnnvlj,t1_fcnbb3p,1577815049.0,"Dogs would probably be a vector for rabies of we took them from the woods and invited them in.

I guess the idea would be domesticated, bred racoons with vaccinations and vet records.

Normal pet stuff."
