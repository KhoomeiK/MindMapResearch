AskTrumpSupporters,ffcc23g,t1_ffc8xny,1579796208.0,"I think it's helpful to think about this in the abstract, instead of getting bogged down in all the details of Trump and Obama. Politicians are not above the law, so someone has to be able to investigate them, right?

Law enforcement officials are human. They make mistakes, they have political opinions, they do dumb stuff. But at least they don't have the same conflict of interest that a president would have, right? Presidents could win or lose an election based on an investigation of their opponent. 

So who should decide whether a politician gets investigated? Career law enforcement or the president who is a rival of the politician?

Neither option is perfect. But I think the answer is clearly that we should leave these decisions to career law enforcement officials. The alternative is a president deciding whether his own opponents get arrested. 

It's like refs in sports. Do refs make mistakes, blow calls, screw stuff up? Sure. But it's better than one team making the calls themselves, right?"
AskTrumpSupporters,ffc6m4n,t1_ffc3scw,1579792743.0,"I assume we both think that politicians should not be above the law, right? And that also, presidents should not use the powers of their office as weapons to attack their rivals?

And you're right that the president, as the head of the executive branch, is the chief law enforcement officer. 

So there's a problem there. How do we trust presidents to investigate their own rivals when they can have so much to gain politically by launching unfair investigations? There's a clear conflict of interest.

So what's your solution? As far as I can tell, your solution is that investigations by Trump = good, investigations of Trump = bad. 

My solution would be the one presidents have followed for decades. That is, presidents should not demand or interfere in specific law enforcement investigations, *especially* when they have a personal stake in the case. Even if they have a pure motive, it's inherently suspicious if presidents are demanding investigations of rivals. 

So if the FBI had independently opened an investigation of Hunter Biden and Trump did nothing to block that investigation? That'd be fine. Hunter Biden is not above the law. 

If Obama had used the foreign policy power of his office to demand that, say, Scotland investigate the Trump golf course for tax fraud, that'd be wrong."
AskTrumpSupporters,ffc22y8,t1_ffc1i1i,1579789592.0,"So if the FBI under Obama investigates associates of Trump, not at Obama's direction, that's impeachable?

I don't think politicians or their campaigns should be above the law. But if they're investigated, it should be based on the decisions of career law enforcement officials reviewing the evidence. It shouldn't be because a rival politician thinks an investigation will smear their reputation and hurt their political prospects."
AskTrumpSupporters,ffc1aau,t1_ffb7h73,1579788995.0,"Objective Americans believe most other presidents were motivated by bribes based on what evidence exactly?

It's an ironic accusation because there's overwhelming evidence that Trump himself solicited a bribe. He demanded a thing of personal value in exchange for a public act. Specifically, he demanded that Ukraine smear his political rival in exchange for US military aid. That meets the elements of the federal bribery statute. 

Yeah, I guess it's not enough to say Trump favors the rich just because he's rich. But I'd say he favors the rich based on his actions as president. His main accomplishment is the tax cut, which has exploded the deficit and benefited the super rich far more than anyone else.

Of course, the US is on the Security Council, so we're not going to authorize war against ourselves. But isn't that just the same as getting away with a crime? It's like a police chief saying he doesn't have to follow the law because he won't arrest himself.

If the US started deliberately murdering civilians, I don't think it's that far-fetched to say there would be countries that would enforce international law through sanctions and other punishments.

In terms of legal obligations, international law is much stronger in state-to-state conflict for the exact reason you noted -- both sides have agreed to the rules. But certain basic limitations apply no matter what. The US has a legal obligation to obey the laws it has ratified.  

You're right that enforcement of international law is weak. But suppose you knew you could get away with murder. Would you say you have no legal or moral obligation not to kill just because you can get away with it?

Additionally, I think it's in the interest of the US to promote respect for international law. We've been key players in crafting these laws. We cite these laws when we're gathering international support to pressure bad actors to do what we want. If the US just decided it could pick and choose which international laws matter, the legitimacy of the whole system collapses. And that would not be in our interest."
AskTrumpSupporters,ff9cne8,t1_ff97gmj,1579709999.0,">international laws mean nothing in a conflict with a non-state entity.

This is factually wrong. While some international laws apply only in state-to-state conflicts, many basic rules apply at all times. For example, international law prohibits indiscriminate attacks, disproportionate attacks, or attacks targeting civilians. 

As you said, if a civilian is a ""threat,"" i.e., they're not really a civilian but actually an enemy combatant, then yes, of course, they're not immune from attack.

I also agree that whether an attack is by ""drone"" or not is sort of beside the point. 

Soldiers don't need to check with lawyers in split second life-or-death situations. But I don't think it's outrageous at all that lawyers at the Pentagon and State Department are involved in military decisions. The US has an obligation to comply with treaties it has ratified, right?"
AskTrumpSupporters,ff82pfn,t1_ff55x5w,1579664417.0,"I just factually disagree with you that practically all non-white people are selfishly promoting their own race's interests above all else. And I doubt there's any kind of actual proof of that claim beyond your own gut feeling. I suspect there's some projection going on there.   

I don't think my political theory is ""subjective."" It just flows from the basic premise that a just government acts in the interests of its people as a collective body.

Look, I recognize that the US is more diverse than most countries. So when Japan acts in the interests of its citizens, that's overwhelming people of Japanese ethnicity. But if a person of Japanese ethnicity is a 3rd generation American, do you think the Japanese government sees that person as a Japanese citizen? No, to both Japan and the US, that person is an American. That's because the world doesn't share your single-minded fixation on race.  

Just because the US is more diverse, that doesn't mean it should act in the interest of just a faction of its population. So no, I don't think my theory only applies to white people, and everyone else gets a pass. The principle that a government should act on behalf of its people is nearly universally accepted. You're the one that thinks the US should be an exception to this rule. In your mind, because the US is diverse, it no longer has the same obligation every other country has to represent its people. Instead, the US government should be a tool to advance the interests of your race. I disagree. And I don't think there's any kind of defensible moral theory that could support your view. 

> I believe that diversity is a weakness and it inevitably leads to conflict.

Sure, you ""believe"" this. But it's not based in fact.

In the analogy to a criminal prosecution, impeachment in the House is like an indictment in front of a grand jury.

If Biden is a witness, the Senate would be digging into issues that Trump might not have known about. And that would be irrelevant to Trump's intent. But to the extent Trump's defense team wants to put on evidence about Trump's state of mind, and about his knowledge of Burisma and Hunter Biden's role on the board, etc., that would be relevant.

AskTrumpSupporters,ff7a4h7,t1_ff72lm9,1579644345.0,"You're making an argument about why you wouldn't find evidence convincing, not whether that evidence could be *relevant*.

In federal court, evidence is relevant if:

>(a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence; and

>(b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.


Trump's intent is clearly ""a fact of consequence."" If Trump knew Biden was corrupt, that would have at least a small ""tendency"" to make it more ""probable"" that Trump was acting with innocent intent. 

Yes, he should have gone to the FBI. But the question is just, all things being equal, does Trump look more guilty if he demanded an investigation of Biden without any reason to believe Biden did anything wrong? And wouldn't the reverse make him look less guilty?

Again, we're on the same page about impeachment / removal. But I think it's important to be clear that the Senate should allow relevant evidence in the trial. Bolton, Mulvaney, etc should testify because they have relevant information. And Democrats can't say that only incriminating evidence is relevant. Trump should be allowed to present relevant evidence in his defense. My original point was really that any new dirt they try to dig up about Hunter Biden is irrelevant.

AskTrumpSupporters,ff6qxr3,t1_ff6a2xm,1579633023.0,"I mean, I mostly agree with you. I wouldn't say it would prove Trump's innocence. But we're just talking about relevance, which is a pretty low standard. 

The issue in the abuse of power charge is, at least in part, whether Trump was acting for his own political interest or in the public interest. If he had facts suggesting Hunter Biden was doing something wrong, that would at least be relevant, right? It slightly suggests there might have been some legitimate basis for his actions. I mean, if he had no facts at all of Biden's wrongdoing, that'd be evidence of his guilt, right? You're pointing out very reasonable counterarguments that the House could make about why he'd still be guilty, but that doesn't mean that evidence would be irrelevant. 

Of course, that's all hypothetical. My point was there's no relevance at all to digging up new dirt about Hunter Biden. The issue is Trump's intent, and his intent couldn't be based on facts he didn't know. There's no reason the Senate should call Hunter Biden as a witness and start interrogating about him about every bad thing he's ever done.

Kinda weird you don't have any actual examples to support this claim, right? 

Of course governments try to exert influence. That's basically the entire point of foreign policy. That doesn't really support your position though.

Yes, Modi is bad. I brought up Modi to show I'm consistent in my views. It's bad for the US to engage in racial discrimination, just like it's bad for India to engage in racial discrimination. It's not like all non-white majority countries engage in the human rights abuses Modi is engaging in. And even if they did, that wouldn't mean America should too.

I'm not just saying your position is unfalsifiable. I'm saying it's immoral and irrational."
AskTrumpSupporters,ff4v8e1,t1_ff4q2lz,1579573247.0,">Suffice it to say that we disagree on what is rational and moral.

Right, except I've offered a pretty comprehensive view on morality, and specifically, what makes a just society. You've just started with your support for racial segregation and tried to work back from there to justify it as at least ""rational."" (Which again, is basically just you trying to argue you're not insane, as opposed to arguing your ideas are actually good ones.)

As for ""ethnocentrism in nonwhites,"" I honestly don't know how many different ways I can explain this. All nations should act in the interests of their citizens, not just factions of their citizens. My view is the same for majority white and majority non-white nations. India, for example, is discriminating against Muslims from neighboring countries. I would say that's morally wrong (and it's been condemned by many in the international community). 

The idea that any nation wants its citizens to flee to other countries is just not based in reality. It's not ""self-serving,"" it would be self-defeating, and as far as I know, it's not happening in any kind of meaningful way. Would you feel like less of a ""sucker"" if you learned your view was based on a fiction? 

So once again, what really matters is the purpose. Is a nation acting for the purpose of advancing the power of one racial group (white or non-white) at the expense of others? I would say that's wrong. Is there some other purpose for a particular immigration policy? Then I don't know, it might be a good policy or a bad one or a dumb one. I'm just condemning here a particular kind of racial bias that's at the center of your worldview.

Sure, people often advocate for policies that might benefit themselves personally or their social / racial / cultural group more broadly. And we, as a society, can debate whether those policies are in fact in the public interest or not. But have you noticed how people generally at least try to make arguments based on the public interest?  I think most people intuitively understand that a just society is supposed to act in the public interest, and government isn't just a tool for self-serving policies.  

And no, you don't need to respond. That's why I said I think we've gone in circles enough. 

I guess you still have some more work to do on your ""best practices"" in ""immigration rhetoric"" if you're hoping to convince people to support overt racial discrimination, huh?"
AskTrumpSupporters,ff4jj0p,t1_fecea64,1579565126.0,"Well this conversation has been dead for a few days because I got busy. And I think it's just about run its course anyway. We've probably both made whatever points we were going to make. 

But to respond/ summarize: It doesn't usually make much sense to say something is rational if it's immoral. You would support Asian immigration to the US if you were Asian, but also Asian immigration is immoral? Why would you support something immoral? You're the one who's been slipping in between arguments about ""rationality"" and ""morality.""  

I'll make this simple: your views are both irrational and immoral. 

They're immoral because a just government represents the interests of all of its citizens. A just government doesn't seek to cement the power of one faction at the expense of all other factions. There are legitimate arguments for and against higher immigration levels. But your argument is not one of them. Your argument is that the US should lower immigration levels to ensure the continued political dominance of white people. That's an immoral position. The American government has an obligation to act in the interest of *Americans*, not just white people. Do some moral policies help some people more than others? Sure. But, to be moral, a policy needs some kind of justification based on the public interest. 

In other words, your position is unjustifiable behind the ""veil of ignorance."" You would never care about cementing the dominance of white people unless you knew you were white. You might favor, for example, taxes on the wealthy to provide health care to the poor. That kind of policy would cause little harm if you turn out to be rich, but enormous benefit if you turn out to be poor and need health care. By contrast, you'd be pretty stupid to maximize the power of a group you might not belong to. I mean, why not say the US should maximize black immigration? Behind the veil of ignorance, you don't know if you'll be black. There's no reason to focus only on the interests of one race. Instead, if we were behind the veil of ignorance, I think we would all favor racial equality, civil liberties, rights for minorities, and so on. That way, no matter if your group was a majority or not, you'd still have basic rights protected. 

The genocide of the Native Americans is a total non sequitur. They were murdered, had their land stolen, etc. The fact that you keep comparing genocide and enslavement to gradual demographic change honestly just shows how far down the white nationalist rabbit hole you've gone. If someone gives you the choice of having your head blown off or in 100 years the US will have a slightly lower percentage of white people, you apparently think these two things are ""literally exactly the same."" 

Your position is also irrational because you're obsessed with race in a way that makes no sense. You've offered two primary defenses of the ""rationality"" of your position: 1) race is like family; and 2) lots of people share your race-centered world view. 

1 is wrong because race is nothing like family. It's different in kind, not just degree. The relationship between mother and child is really nothing like two random people who share nothing in common but general complexion. It's silly.       

2 is wrong because I think your particular views are not very popular at all. And even if they were popular, so what? Lots of people are racist. That doesn't mean it's rational to be racist. We shouldn't enact racist policies just because people are racist.  

So no, it's not rational to favor a white immigrant over a non-white immigrant, simply because of the color of their skin. That's not a rational way to judge a person's value to society. And even if it were rational, it would still be wrong because it's immoral (see above). 

A quick glance over your comment history shows that nearly every comment or post you've made on this site has been about race. You've talked about how black people are more violent or white people need to protect their power. You even have a thread about ""best practices"" in ""immigration rhetoric"" where you suggest hiding your racialized world view because you know it'll repulse people. Don't you have other interests or opinions? It is honestly pretty strange. 

But we've obviously gone in circles enough on this. I assume I didn't change your mind on anything. But I dunno, maybe I've inspired you to read A Theory of Justice by John Rawls and it'll totally blow your mind. Who knows."

>I think slavery is fundamentally wrong and I think replacing a population is wrong.

Slavery violates the most fundamental rights that human beings have. Gradual demographic change, uh, doesn't. Comparing the two is absolutely ridiculous. 

Is every non-white person in America today ""literally"" enslaved? They're not a majority. So this absolute travesty you're so terrified of, that you think is ""literally exactly the same as"" as slavery -- every non-white person in America is currently experiencing. If someone says, would you like to a) be beaten and raped and separated from your family and deprived of every shred of human dignity for the rest of your life, or b) be a member of a racial group that's 49% of a nation's population (larger than any other group) -- you see those as ""literally exactly the same?""

If we're talking about the veil of ignorance, it makes no sense to be worried about whites becoming a minority. You'd be worried that you might end up in a racial group that, in a few decades, is still the biggest and most powerful racial group but is less than a majority? Wouldn't you be more worried about ending up as a current minority? Wouldn't you want to focus on policies that guarantee equal rights for all, rather than protecting the power of one group, which you might not even be a member of?  

And what the hell does ""replacing a population"" even mean? We all get replaced by future generations. So do you mean it's wrong for the demographic composition of a nation to ever change at all? What principle is that based on? Or it's just wrong for a race to ever drop below 50%?  Say Latinos become 51% of the US population -- it would be morally wrong for whites to ever again rise above 50% after that point?    

You had said before that your view was dependent on your race. You said if you were Asian, for example, you would support more Asian immigration to the US. I assume you're now backtracking from that now? If it's ""wrong"" to ""replace"" a population, then why would you support doing something ""wrong"" just depending on your race?

The immigration system is insanely complicated. I'm not pretending to know all the intricacies of it. And I'm certainly not saying our current system is perfect (or close to it).

My problem with your view is not in the details (because we've barely discussed any). It's that you think the US government should specifically serve the interests of white people.

I think the Italian government should serve the interests of the Italian people. And the French government should serve the interests of the French people. And the American government should serve the interests of the American people. But you think the *American* government should serve the interests of *white* people, right? See the problem there?

It's true that not all government policies will always benefit 100% of people. But, I think, in a democratic society, you have to make your case that a particular policy is in the *public good*. You have to argue that a policy is best for the people, as a whole.

What exactly is the ""public good?"" That's obviously a matter of intense debate in any democracy. (I would say it's the policies you reach from behind the veil of ignorance.) But however you define it, it has to be objective, right? Meaning, you can't define it by reference to your own personal situation or skin color. You can't say, ""For me, the public good is X, but for you, it's Y."" That makes no sense. People can disagree about what the public good is, but you can't argue it's multiple contradictory things simultaneously.

Now, maybe you'd say maintaining a white majority is in the public interest. But you'd have to make some kind of argument for why that is. You can't just say the public good is defined by whatever maximizes overall genetic similarity with yourself. And I don't think you can just say that whites have been a historical majority, and therefore it should remain that way. Lots of things have been historically true, but that doesn't mean they must remain that way forever."
AskTrumpSupporters,fdycu3p,t1_fdpdma2,1578778356.0,">the outcome of your moral framework is that the most racist, xenophobic societies get an absolutely massive advantage over those that are even marginally less ethnocentric (because they can discriminate against basically the entire world and it's completely fine because it isn't inherently racial). In contrast, if you're xenophobic enough that you don't like people that are super foreign, but you are cool with people that are only a little bit foreign -- well you're fucked. 

I don't follow how that's an implication of what I'm saying. Again, the *purpose* matters. If a country is prohibiting immigration for the purpose of advancing the interests of a particular race, that's morally wrong. 

I also think it's strange that you have this idea that other countries are happy when their citizens leave. As if their citizens are infiltrating foreign countries. That's not how any country sees it. It's not an ""advantage."" Most people don't want to leave their homes. But they'll do it to pursue economic opportunity, to flee violence, etc. So countries are generally embarrassed when their citizens are leaving. It's a sign the country is dysfunctional. 

You're right that lots of immigrants want to come to the US. In your mind, this is because we're suckers. But really, it's because people value the economic prosperity and freedom we have in the US. That doesn't necessarily mean we should let everyone in. But the fact that so many immigrants want to come to the US is a sign of our strength, not weakness. 

>There's no way you can possibly think that ""maximizing the power of White people"" is actually my underlying principle for how the world should be organized.  

Maybe it's not your principle for how the ""world"" should be organized. But we're talking about what immigration policy the US should adopt. And that is what you want the US to do, right? Are you taking issue with the word ""maximize?"" Because you've said repeatedly you're scared whites will lose political power in the US. And you think immigration policy should be used as a tool to maintain or enhance white power. Am I misunderstanding you in any way? 

>The beliefs I have that lead me to nationalism don't depend on my Whiteness, and so they would be intact no matter what race I am. But clearly, my racial/ethnic interests do impact the policies that I would support in practice.

You're not really a ""nationalist,"" right? You're a white nationalist. You've said you don't actually care what happens to America, you care what happens to white people. 

Here's the question we've been discussing: What immigration policy should the US adopt? 

So, as you acknowledge, your answer to that question depends on your race. And Rawls would say that means your answer is unjust.  

The whole point of the Rawls thought experiment is to decide what laws a community should adopt. It doesn't really make sense to talk about global laws because there is no global government. I think it's fine to acknowledge other countries exist. So maybe, behind the veil of ignorance, you would decide it's a good idea to spend tax money on a military to defend the community from hostile foreign nations. But I don't think it makes sense to start talking about how much other countries should spend on their militaries. That's what you're doing with immigration policy. The question is what laws a sovereign community would fairly adopt. In this case, that community is the US. 

Here's how I see it:

1. A just government acts in the interests of its people.
2. ""People"" includes all people, regardless of race.
3. Therefore, if a government's policy is intended to serve the interests of only one race, it's an unjust policy.

Which part of that do you disagree with? 

As I've said, this rule would allow for all for all kinds of immigration policies. Maybe some of those policies would be dumb or harmful. My problem is with your intent. You ""want an immigration policy that serves White interests."" And that's what I think is unjust. 

>actually, some kind of quota system would be the fairest outcome IMO, as I said from the very beginning.

I don't think a quota system for immigration is inherently unjust. Is it based on country of origin and not race? Is the intent to serve the interests of only one race? 

I would think it would be dumb if that's the only immigration program. What about family reunification? An American citizen can't live in the US with his wife? What about people with in-demand skills or people who will start businesses or study at US universities? But if we're just talking about random lottery allocation of spots, then I think a quota is fine. Are the quotas based on the size of the countries the people are immigrating from? We have quotas already for the diversity immigration program."

I was apparently being unclear because I wasn't trying to dodge the question. None of these options are ""inherently unacceptable.""

My position is that the *purpose* behind a policy matters. Maximizing the power of one race is not a permissible *purpose* for a government policy. A government exists to represent the interests of all of its people -- not just white people. A government that acts only on behalf of one race is an unjust government. 

There are a billion other reasons I might support or oppose a government policy. So I'm not saying it would be a good idea for the US to set immigration at zero. And if the reason for setting immigration at zero were to ensure the political power of one race, then that would be unjust (for the reasons I just explained above). 

But, I dunno, what if there was some global pandemic and we couldn't verify that  any immigrants (or immigrants from certain countries) weren't infected? Then that's a race-neutral justification for limiting immigration.

Is it ok to only allow immigrants from England and France? Well, I don't know, what's the purpose of this policy? Is the purpose to protect the interests of white people? Then it's unjust. Or is there some other, race-neutral justification for it?  Even if there is a race-neutral justification, that doesn't mean I would support that policy. Maybe the justification is to attract good soccer players. That would be a pretty dumb. But it wouldn't violate the rule I've described that a just government policy can't be motivated by racial animus / favoritism. Same thing for allowing only immigrants from France because they helped us in the Revolution. Race-neutral, but doesn't seem like a good idea.  

I think this should be pretty intuitive. Is it acceptable for an employer to fire a black employee? It depends! Is it because the employee sucks? Then yes, that's fine. Is it because the employee is black? Then no, that's illegal racial discrimination. The same act can be acceptable or not depending on its purpose. 

>Of course, implementing such a policy AFTER you import millions of nonwhites with family ties...yeah, that wouldn't keep the country White. But I am glad that you at least think that there are moral immigration policies we could have had in the past that would have protected a White majority.

The policies wouldn't have been moral if the *purpose* was to protect a white majority.

Also, ""import?"" You import goods, not people. If you don't want people to assume you're racist, you should try to avoid using dehumanizing language about people who aren't white.  

>You're talking about *banning* immigrants. That's not what I asked. I asked about **accepting** immigrants. You're talking as though people have an existing right to move wherever they want.

I think I've answered this now, but I just want to point out this whole conversation is pretty detached from the way immigration actually works. It's not like just anybody can come to the US. Immigrants have to apply for specific visa programs, mostly based on their job, family, or asylum. Some of those programs have per-country caps, but others don't. It would be strange if an American citizen could live in the US with his wife if she's German but not if she's Korean, right?   

*Kant / Rawls*

Kant was actually a virulent racist. So while I think he developed the most coherent framework for understanding morality, I'm not necessarily looking to his specific views on moral questions. 

In any case, Rawls is the one who applied Kantian ethics to public policy (Kant was thinking more about individual moral choices). And I don't really see how Rawls would be comfortable with your goal of maximizing white power.

The whole point of the ""veil of ignorance"" is it asks what we would choose if we were blind to our actual circumstances. 

Pretend you don't know your race. You are going to be randomly assigned the position of any one of the 300 million people in the US. You might be black, white, Asian, poor, rich, smart, dumb, gay, straight, etc. You don't know. What policies would you choose? Yes, think from a ""self-interested"" standpoint, but you don't actually know what your individual interests will be. So it's really asking you to pick what's fair to everybody. That's the beauty of the thought experiment. 

So if you didn't know you'd be white, would you still want to maximize the power of white people?"

AskTrumpSupporters,fdjzooo,t1_fdj82x7,1578492365.0,"My argument here isn't just countries should maximize total numbers of immigrants. There's a whole separate discussion about what's a wise level of immigration. 

My problem with your position is that you want to use immigration as a tool to increase the power of the white race. You want to secure the existence of your people and a future for white children, or something like that, no? 

So intent matters. What's the reason for the immigration policy? Do I think it's permissible for Britain to favor immigrants with ties to Britain (i.e. a grandparent who was a British citizen or something like that)? Yes, if that's based on a valid justification, such as family reunification. A state can favor its own people (based on nationality, not race), and therefore it's permissible to favor immigrants with ties to those people. 

Is it permissible to ban immigrants from a particular country? Is the policy based on some kind of racial animus (or racial favoritism)? Then no. Is it instead based on some kind of rational national security justification? Then probably ok. (Although I'm pretty skeptical a blanket ban, rather than just more careful vetting, would ever be necessary.)

So I'm not supporting a ""stricter"" immigration policy. I'm just saying ""don't discriminate based on race."" That doesn't imply states *should* adopt the maximally restrictive immigration policy that's race-neutral. 

I honestly don't know what immigration policies Japan has. You're the one arguing that your fixation on genetic sameness is totally normal and practically every other country does it. So I think the burden is on you to actually show that's true. 

What are all these countries that discriminate in immigration based on race, not just national ties? Israel is one example, although there was that whole, you know, Holocaust, so that might make it a special case. You've said this is practically universal though, right? 

Re: banning Asians

As I've said, I believe racial discrimination is both unconstitutional and wrong. So 1) no, it wouldn't be ok to target Asians or any other group, even if a majority supported it. And 2) I very much doubt a majority would support that kind of policy. Your white purity vision doesn't exactly have broad support. 

*Ethics*

According to Kant, there is a ""categorical imperative"" for all people: “I ought never to act except in such a way that I could also will that my maxim should become a universal law.”

Basically, it's not rational to do something if you think other people should not be allowed to do that thing. So is it ok to murder my neighbor and steal his money? No, because I would not want to live in a society in which it is ok to murder people and take their money. So as a rational person, I must live by the rule that murder is not ok.

My username is actually a play on ""John Rawls,"" who was a philosopher who adapted Kant's moral theory into a political philosophy. According to Rawls, to figure out the rules for a just government, we first have to pretend we're behind a ""veil of ignorance."" Pretend you don't know anything about your race, your gender, your intelligence, the wealth of your family, whether you'll be born with a disability. You just know you're going to be a random person in this society. What kind of rules would you rationally want to implement? 

According to Rawls, we would want a robust safety net. There's a risk you'll be born with a disability or poor, so you'll want to make sure you don't starve. But you'll probably still favor a capitalist system to reward you if you hit the jackpot in life. And capitalism also creates more wealth overall, so that's good. 

You'll also want to make sure the laws protect everyone equally. You don't know what race you'll be, so you'll want to make sure the laws protect you no matter what. According to Rawls, if there's a policy that you favor only once you know your position or race, and if it's not one you would favor behind the ""veil of ignorance,"" that policy is unjust. 

So that's a rough summary of the ethical rules that I think make the most sense."
AskTrumpSupporters,fdiyzao,t1_fdiucvf,1578454287.0,"Racial classifications are inherently suspect. They have a deeply ugly history and there's basically never a good reason to treat human beings differently just based on the skin they were born with. There's a whole body of constitutional law built on the idea of race being a suspect classification, so it's not exactly an unknown concept. Other classifications are a lot less suspect (think age limits for driving, etc.)

Let's say Japan is trying to decide which applicants for immigration to accept. I think it's a valid justification to favor the person who has ties to the country. They presumably already have family in Japan that want to be reunited with them. Family reunification is a rational, race-neutral immigration policy. This policy would apply equally to say, a white person who has family in Japan, and a person of Japanese heritage. So it's not like it's just a more narrow racial classification (Japanese instead of Asian). It's race-neutral. The motivation behind it is keeping families together, which presumably leads to a lot more happiness and less suffering. The motivation is not maximizing genetic sameness at all costs because ... reasons.

So do you see how your idea is not nearly as widespread as you think it is? Most countries don't discriminate based on race the way you're proposing.

>Why should we care about the national interest? Why not allocate resources to the people that are most globally in need, and so we could get the highest return on our investment (by that I mean save the most lives, or help the most people, etc.)?

In terms of my own individual moral obligations, I think this might be right. I'm not sure my moral obligations to a person depend on that person's nationality. In terms of practicality, it's easier for me to help people in my own community.

But I think a state is different than a person. A state has obligations to protect its people. That's why states are created. So when states enact policies (like on immigration), I think they should advance the national interest (broadly defined).

The US has obligations to all of its people though. Not just white people.   

>Why should someone care about anything other than their direct self-interest? Not even necessarily their family. Just literally going through life with the goal of maximizing pleasure and avoiding pain, on a purely individualistic level.

If constitutional interpretation was too big of a debate, I think all of ethical philosophy has gotta be too much. I read some [Kant in college](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/), and I thought he had the best take on things (even though his writing style was awful)."

It's not really worth veering into a whole debate about constitutional interpretation. But briefly -- I don't think ""intent"" is all that important. An entire Congress rarely has a single ""intent"" and reading minds is impossible. I think we're bound by the words they actually enacted. Even most conservative scholars now favor ""original meaning"" instead of ""original intent."" There were segregated schools in DC when Congress passed the 14th Amendment, so does that mean *Brown v.

Standing is about injury, so that wouldn't be hard to show. Whether particular constitutional rights apply outside the US is complicated and unclear. I do think if tomorrow, Congress said America belongs to white people and then passed a racially discriminatory immigration law, the Supreme Court would probably strike that law down. Trying to transform the US into a white ethnostate really strikes at the heart of the principle of racial equality. But like I said before -- I'm also making a moral argument, not just a legal one.

>Setting all that aside, an immigration quota system that considered race as a factor wouldn't have to be a blanket ban and it could result in a Whiter country. Race could be a factor in admission to the U.S., just like it is in universities. Do you think Affirmative Action violates the 14th amendment?

There's honestly a good chance the Supreme Court will declare affirmative action unconstitutional in the next couple of years. Racial quotas in university admissions already are unconstitutional. [Source](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/438/265). Using race as a factor (without numerical quotas) is subject to strict scrutiny. I think there's a much stronger argument for a compelling state interest in diverse student bodies and graduates than there is for your immigration plan. The state does not have a compelling interest in ensuring that future immigrants are genetically similar to u/SincereDiscussion.

>I would prefer to allocate resources to people that I have the most in common with.

Ok, but why do you assume genetics are all that matter? Suppose you have a black neighbor who shares your interests and values. You went to the same schools, you work in the same profession now. You watch the same TV shows, listen to the same music. And there's some random white guy who doesn't speak English and who has nothing in common with you besides his race. You'd say you have more ""in common"" with the white guy?

And why do you assume that commonality is even a good justification for allocating resources? Maybe we should allocate resources to maximize national welfare? Why would people who have something in common with you be more deserving?

>A crucial point here is that the worldview I am describing is more in line with how most people actually behave than you seem to be granting

I think you're confusing discrimination based on *nationality* with discrimination based on *race*. I am, admittedly, not an expert on the immigration laws of every country on earth. But how many countries really discriminate based on race? 

I assume it's easier to immigrate to lots of countries based on family ties to that country. Of course, in many cases, that will correlate with racial groups. So if your parents or grandparents are Japanese citizens, it's (I assume) easier for you to become a Japanese citizen. But it's not like they're saying ""Asians only, no white or black people.""

Family ties to the US can also help you immigrate to the US. Closer family ties give you higher priority, and of course, marriage lets you skip ahead entirely.

What you're advocating is totally different. It's not just about family heritage in the US. What will matter is the color of a person's skin, right? They'll have to pass some blood purity test?

The answer is yes. This isn't some debatable or subjective question. The law is explicit.

Because there is a correct answer here. The answer is that only Congress can declare ""war."" Article I of the US Constitution explicitly says, ""The Congress shall have the Power ... To declare War.""

So, if the US military is engaged in combat, but Congress hasn't declared war, it must be a ""conflict."" Does that make sense?

Again, no. The war/ conflict distinction matters because the US Constitution uses the word ""war."" 

But the Geneva Conventions and other international laws apply to ""armed conflict."" What makes you think that international agreements don't apply to conflicts? 

Here's a provision of the first Geneva Convention:

""[T]he present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of **any other armed conflict**""

I think (maybe??) you're assuming a ""war"" must be between states and a ""conflict"" is with non-state groups, like terrorists. Is that right? 

Because then it is true that not all international laws apply. The Convention I cited above, for example, only applies to conflicts ""which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties"" (ie, states that signed the agreement). But it's not like the US gets to decide which international laws apply based on how the US classifies the fighting. It depends on what kind of entity is on the other side. 

I think you're right that too much of international law is stuck in a 20th century idea of state vs. state fighting (probably because states write international law). But ""war"" and ""conflict"" have particular meanings in this context, and you're misusing them. This thread is about declarations of war (which only Congress can make), so when you say that affects international law, you're just incorrect."

Source? If Congress passed a law banning non-white immigrants from the US, it seems unlikely to me that could survive in court. Classifications based on race are subject to strict scrutiny, and your desire to transform the US into a nation by and for white people is not a compelling government interest. It's actually the exact kind of racial hierarchy the 14th Amendment is meant to prohibit.  

I know the US used to exclude Chinese people, and the Supreme Court never struck that down. But the Court, as far as I know, never actually ruled on an Equal Protection claim against Chinese exclusion. The Court [did make clear](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/118/356) though that the 14th Amendment applies to persons, not just citizens. 

I suppose you could argue that at some point, there could be 5 justices on the Court willing to carve an exception out of the 14th Amendment for immigration. Courts have given more leeway to the political branches on immigration than in other areas. 

But I would argue, not just as a legal matter, but as a moral matter, that immigration laws that prefer people based on the color of their skin are wrong. The 14th Amendment embodies a concept of human equality, regardless of race, that is the opposite of your proposal. The US government should not favor or disfavor any person based solely on their race -- in immigration or in any other context. 

To circle back to an earlier point (and I think the core disagreement here): 

>I've never said I can't support it with logical arguments! Where are you getting that from? I've specifically tried to make the case that ethnocentrism is logical. 

I acknowledge that your position is internally coherent. You care more about white people than you care about non-white people. There's nothing inconsistent or incoherent about that. Similarly, it's not incoherent to care more about tall people than short people. Or to care more about bald men than men with hair. Or to like vanilla ice cream instead of chocolate ice cream. Those are all just preferences. They're essentially non-falsifiable. (And at least they don't have the ugly history that your racial preferences have.)

But usually when someone makes a political argument, they're not just saying: ""I prefer X."" They're saying: ""You should prefer X too"" or ""X is the morally right choice"" or ""The US should do adopt X policy."" Otherwise, what's the point in even having the conversation?  

I'm white. But have you made any arguments that were supposed to persuade me I should care more about white people than non-white people? I understand you have this obsession with race, but why should I?  

Your main argument seems to be an analogy: a person's race is like family. Almost everyone cares more about family than strangers, therefore it makes sense to care more about one's own race.

But race isn't like family. Why should I feel some special kinship with some random person I've never met in Bulgaria just because our skin tones are roughly similar? Families love each other, provide for each other, spend time with each other. That's nothing like the connection between two people on opposite sides of the planet who happen to share a race.

I don't think I care for my family just because we have similar genes. But even if genetic similarity were part of it, how would that get me all the way to supporting your discriminatory immigration policy? Humans are all about 99% genetically similar, right? So a parent is, what, 99.99% similar to a child? Random person of the same race (but different ethnic background) might be 99.2% similar and a person of a different race might be 99%?   

My point is: why should I care? I mean, I suppose it's coherent for you to say ""Ah, but that tiny bit of extra genetic closeness is enough to justify my worldview!"" Sure, I guess. But it's not *persuasive*. Why should I demand that I be surrounded by only people who are a few tenths of a percent more genetically close to me? What good does that serve?   

You're scared of all these apocalyptic race war scenarios. Well damn, I don't want the US to turn into some Mad Max-style hellscape either! I think it would be bad if white people were rounded up and murdered. But I also think it would be bad if that happened to black people too. That's because, to me, a person's worth does not depend on their race. All human beings are equally deserving of respect, dignity, and liberty. So rather than fixating on ways to ensure that in 50 years, the average US population is 99.15% genetically similar to you instead of 99.1%, maybe we should focus on other ways of ensuring the US is still a free and prosperous country then?"

AskTrumpSupporters,fdcvr0a,t1_fcwqskk,1578285707.0,">If the U.S. massively reduced, or even eliminated entirely, immigration in 1965, would that be problematic in your opinion?

It would be dumb, but at least it wouldn't be racist. I think there are various policy reasons that immigration has made us a stronger nation and helped our economy. Immigrants have founded major companies, won Nobel Prizes, etc. We also have obligations under international treaties to accept refuges. But it's bad for different reasons than racial discrimination is bad.  

>You talked about how you want to preserve American values and you contrasted that with how I, on the other hand, want to return to a ""White ethnostate"" (with the implication that those things are contradictory).

They are contradictory. Again, the 14th Amendment guarantees ""equal protection of the laws,"" regardless of race. We had a whole Civil War about this! In the United States, all human beings are equal before the law.  A ""restrictive immigration policy"" is not necessarily unconstitutional. But an immigration policy that discriminates based on race is unconstitutional. 

The United States does not exist for the advancement and protection of the white race over other races. If you want the US to be a white ethnostate, you would need to re-write the Constitution. Your vision is in direct conflict with the Reconstruction Amendments. 

Even racists in the Jim Crow South accepted the existence of the 14th Amendment. That's why they wanted ""separate but *equal*."" It's an incoherent concept, but even they acknowledged that racial equality under the law was mandated by the 14th Amendment. 

It seems you oppose racial equality under the law. Is that belief limited to immigration? Or do you believe the US should also discriminate against non-whites in voting, property rights, and so on? Do you want full racial apartheid? Or do non-whites get to keep their rights if they were already here before your racial immigration shutdown begins? I mean, immigration presumably accounts for a pretty small percentage in the growth of the non-white population, right? Maybe we should start stripping non-white Americans of their citizenship and deporting them, right? Or prohibiting them from having children?"

Fair enough, you didn't say it was ""irrational"" to prefer immigrants of your own race. That was poor word choice on my part. I understood you to be saying it's not a preference you can really support with logical arguments. It's more of a premise that you think should have intuitive appeal and that most people would naturally want. And I was saying that I don't share that impulse at all. I don't feel any more kinship with someone just because of the color of their skin.  

>Is there any policy that would result in Whites remaining a majority that you would say ISN'T discriminatory? (Temporarily set aside mind-reading; i.e ""Well, you're only proposing it because you want Whites to remain a majority, therefore it's racist).

>Let's say it's 1965. I'm feeling generous, so I'm not going to even talk about muh demographic fairness. I say: ""You know what? The U.S. HAS been racist and it HAS been discriminatory. So let's rectify that with a new immigration policy. It will let in precisely ZERO European immigrants. Everyone will be either African, Hispanic, Asian, or whatever you want. The catch: the total number of immigrants will be considerably smaller"".

You misunderstand my position. I'm not arguing for social engineering or demographic manipulation. You are. 

You talk a lot about your fear of being ""replaced,"" which is a bit abstract (and, I think, kind of strange). Unfortunately, we're all going to be replaced. That's how dying works. 

So what is that you're really proposing? As I understand it, you're saying the US should prohibit any immigration by non-white people. Or at least, the US should heavily prefer white immigrants to non-white immigrants. Are either of those correct? 

I'm not proposing we favor non-white immigrants. I don't think race should be a factor in immigration policy at all. The government can consider other factors, such as having in-demand skills, ties to this country (such as family already here), or even a random lottery. But an immigrant is not more or less desirable just because of their skin color. Current US immigration policy does not consider race, and it hasn't for a very long time. 

I've been assuming you're not an actual white supremacist. But maybe I should clarify that. Do you believe that white people are inherently superior to other races? Or do you believe all human beings are deserving of equal rights and dignity? 

Because if you're not a white supremacist, if you believe that all people are fundamentally equal, then I really don't get where your fear of non-white immigrants is coming from. There are still going to be lots of white people in America in 50 or 100 years. Even if the US becomes majority-minority, that's still more white people than any other single racial group. White people are not going to be wiped out. White people are not going to be sterilized or rounded up in concentration camps or something. So even if I grant that it's understandable to care more about people of your own race (which I don't), I still don't get what calamity you're so worried about. 

The United States is not a white ethnostate. The Constitution does not guarantee that white people must forever constitute greater than 50 percent of the population. Instead, the 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection of the laws to all people -- regardless of race. So if you'd rather live in a country that's explicitly dedicated to the advancement of white people, then maybe you're in the wrong country. Maybe it's not the non-white people who don't belong here."

I think it's understandable to regulate the influx of people into this country. It's also worth noting that many green cards are already allocated with per-country caps.

What I don't agree with you on is the fetishization of race. I think racial discrimination is evil. We can't let everyone into our country -- but we shouldn't decide who gets in based on the color of their skin. It's not a valid basis for making decisions. White immigrants aren't inherently preferable to non-white immigrants. 

You say you prefer white immigrants because they are ""genetically similar"" to you. You also seem to acknowledge this argument is, at its core, irrational. I understand humans aren't always rational. But I honestly don't understand the appeal of this argument at all. I get giving special care to one's own children, but why should I especially care about someone who is not related to me, on the other side of the world, whom I've never met, just because we share a skin color? I should care about him more than, say, my own neighbor, who doesn't share my skin color? That is not at all intuitive to me.  

Additionally, where exactly do you draw the line on genetic similarity? All human beings are pretty similar to each other genetically. I doubt you've actually done some analysis of average genetic similarity across all racial groups. What if it turns out that some people of X racial group are actually more genetically similar to you than certain other ""white"" people? Would that change your opinion? I kind of doubt it. 

Alternatively, you say white Americans should feel solidarity with each other because they are ""being attacked throughout society."" This is, in my opinion, just whiny and silly. You feel under attack because some blue-haired girls at Vassar say ""white people cause climate change?"" To recap: historically, white people in the US have discriminated against non-white people and deprived them of equal opportunities. Some people have proposed remedial measures for this history of discrimination and have sought to bring more attention to current racial inequalities. Therefore, you believe white people should discriminate more by blocking non-white people from entering the country. Did I get that right? I admit I don't quite follow the logic.   

I can understand a person of Irish heritage feeling a special connection with the Irish people, or a Jewish person feeling a special connection to the Jewish people. But not all white people in the US have some shared history or culture or traditions (or at least, not more so than they share with non-white Americans). 

Additionally, who are the people actively promoting a *white* identity? Who are the people arguing that whites need to join in solidarity against non-whites? It's neo-Nazis, the KKK, and other white supremacists. Does that give you pause at all? I gather your position is not that white people are inherently superior to non-white people. But do you ever pause to wonder whether your argument that the US government should discriminate against all immigrants who aren't white might, just maybe, be driven by some unconscious prejudice? What do you think is at the root of this belief that people who are ""genetically similar"" to you deserve special preferences? Ever tried interrogating that belief at all? Not worried that it's a pretty fine line between favoring people because they are ""genetically similar"" and favoring people because they are ""genetically superior?"" 

>Your narrative of ideological continuity over time is simply ridiculous. You believe in very different things than most Americans did 30 years ago, let alone hundreds of years ago. You get that narrative from school textbooks that include phrases like ""We haven't always lived up to our values, but..."". In other words, it's just historical revisionism!

Notice that the values I cited are all literally part of the Constitution. I acknowledged that racial equality was added later (after the Civil War). I'm not saying 100% of people throughout US history have respected those values. But I think it's fair to cite our Constitution as representing American values. I didn't just pick some random liberal priorities of the moment. I'm pretty sure 30 years ago, the Constitution still guaranteed religious freedom, democracy, individual liberty, and equal protection under the law.

Sure, cultural traditions, language, etc. are worth preserving. But it’s not obvious to me why we should discriminate against potential immigrants based on genetics. I agree that, throughout history, lots of people have been prejudiced against people who looked differently than them. Is that really a good enough reason to keep being prejudiced though? I also don’t think racial animus is nearly as universal as you seem to think it is.

It would be especially irrational for the United States to discriminate based on “genetics.” At least Irish, Swedish, Japanese, etc. are identifiable ethnic groups. But “American” is not an identifiable ethnic group. The United States has always been a mix of people from different backgrounds.

You say it's ""rational for a person to care about his ethnic group,"" but I don't think that's quite what you're proposing. It's not like you're just saying the English should want to preserve English heritage. You're saying *white* Americans should see themselves as a unified group against non-white Americans, right? What you’re really proposing is full-on racial discrimination. You don’t want non-white immigrants. I don’t mean to be rude — but that is what you’re saying, right?

But why exactly do you think white Americans are all one ethnic group? It’s not like people from Greece and Norway are the same. They’re both “European,” but those are very different groups. Why do you think the United States should prefer an immigrant from Norway over an immigrant from Mexico? It’s not like Norwegians built America. It’s not like we share a cultural history or language with them.

One of the things that makes the United States special is that we’re defined by shared values — freedom of religion, democracy, individual liberty. We wrote racial equality into our Constitution. That’s what we have in common with each other. Nearly everyone in the United States today is here because at some point, in the last few generations, their family came here looking for a better life. And that shared cultural tradition is what I want to preserve. You, as far as I can tell, want to recreate the United States as some white ethnostate. I want to preserve American values. You want to preserve ""genetic similarity,"" so that we all have similar skin tones or nose shapes or something. Is that right?"
AskTrumpSupporters,fbyzhp7,t1_fbwm63c,1577230612.0,">I don't understand where you're getting ""only the views of certain racial or ethnic groups count"" from anything I said -- maybe you got that from how I said Whites didn't want to be replaced. I was referring to history (how we never supported mass nonwhite immigration). Post-1965 immigrants and their descendants, by definition, were not in the country prior to 1965. I'm not saying they should be kicked out of the country or stripped of voting rights. I'm simply saying that the people who WERE in the country at the time did not support increasing immigration. 

My point was simply that the INA, like all federal legislation, passed through both chambers of Congress and was signed by the president. So you can't really argue it lacks democratic legitimacy. And it's not like the point of the INA was to establish open borders or something like that. It loosened immigration rules in some ways and tightened them in others. 

>In any case, I do think that the concerns of the people who founded the country should be a priority, but I would be more than satisfied with proportional representation in the immigration system. (Although we need Affirmative Action to correct the racial injustice of the immigration laws we've had for the past few decades).

The people ""who founded the country"" have all been dead for a couple hundred years. Their concerns do have ""priority"" in the sense that we're still bound by the Constitution they wrote. The United States had no immigration limits at all for the first hundred years of its existence, so it seems to me that harsh immigration limits were not a ""priority"" for the founders. 

Or are you saying the direct descendants of the founders should have special rights today? Or is what you really mean that white people should have special rights?  

>MLK himself didn't believe in equality under the law, though. He wanted special treatment for blacks, not equality (e.g. Affirmative Action). We also have a form of what I described, albeit not as all-encompassing and far more inefficient (lawsuits for companies that don't hire the 'correct' number of blacks based upon demographics).

You cannot sue a company for not hiring the ""correct"" number of black people. [See Ricci v. DeStefano](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/557/557/). Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination in employment ""because of race."" The law protects all races equally, so it's illegal to not hire a white person because of race as much as it is illegal to not hire a black person because of race. The idea that MLK didn't believe in racial equality under the law is just silly and anti-historical. 

>But I don't think it's racist for a predominantly European country to remain predominantly European. 

Ok first off, the United States is, literally, not a ""European"" country. But why exactly do you think it should ""remain predominantly European?"" 

The United States has not been dominated by a single ethnic group for more than 150 years. In the 1800s, English was absolutely considered a different ethnic group from Irish, Italian, Polish, etc. ""European"" was not considered a coherent ethnic identity. 

So it seems to me that you have to say either a) only people descended from English colonists are authentic Americans, or b) Irish, Italians, etc. are ok because they're ""European"" (aka white). 

Option A is absurdly limited. What percentage of Americans could claim that kind of purity? For Option B, it's not clear to me why you're arbitrarily drawing the line at ""European."" Those groups were as different in terms of culture, religion, and language from the native-born Americans of that time as the groups immigrating today are from native-born Americans today. So if those groups have successfully integrated and made the US stronger, why shouldn't the groups immigrating today do the same? 

US history and culture has always been defined by immigrants. This idea that there's some genuine ""American"" culture or heritage that exists without influence from immigrants is a bit strange. 

>It would be like saying ""Ukrainians who resented Russification during the USSR days? Yeah, you guys were just bigots. If you don't want to adopt Russian culture, speak Russian, and be replaced by Russians, that's a big yikes from me.""

You realize military domination is not the same thing as immigration, right? So, no, it's not ""like saying"" that. No one is sticking a gun in your face and ordering you to speak Spanish.  

In any case, enjoy the holidays, buddy."
