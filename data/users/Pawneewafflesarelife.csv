mildlyinteresting,ffkr2d4,t1_ffj51az,1580027388.0,"San Diego native here. It doesn't rain much, but when it does it can be bad - freeways are not built for rain and the oil makes slicks, while the drivers are dumb and don't slow down, so car accidents spike. If there's been fire, the hillsides don't have plant roots firming up the terrain, so you get mudslides and flash floods. Rose Creek backs up and because idiot kids throw rocks in the drains by the in n out, you get sewage backup and *wonderful* aromas through the Mission Bay area. Speaking of Mission Bay, since it's a man-made bay, it sucks at being a bay, so rains cause weird things like that jellyfish invasion 20 years ago.

On top of that, every now and then we get an El Niño year which completely overwhelms the drainage systems. Mission Valley has been built up with condos in the time since we've last had a big El Niño winter, while the infrastructure is still pretty much the same, so that should be a fun surprise for the non-locals duped into buying those pricey places (last time, it completely flooded out the roads between the north and south of the 8).

So far, I've got my kitties trained to sit on command, not jump/grab during treats and they recognize when my husband is home (I sing a little song), but we seem to have hit a wall. Also, my boy cat has trained ME to carry him around in a box - he'll jump in his box, which is just one of those collapsible cloth drawers from a shelving unit, and then slow blink, which means he wants to be carried around the house above my head for high views.

australia,ffkfkau,t1_ffjbthf,1580021944.0,"Homemade sauces are actually really easy to make and much cheaper than jarred stuff. I've spent the last year really focusing on learning cooking and we've saved a ton (and lost weight) not buying premade sauces anymore. Even stuff like BBQ and tomato sauce tastes yummy and uses far less sugar and preservatives if made at home.

 The convenience factor of the premade stuff is nice, but big batches + freezing helps compete with that and makes for easy meal prep."
australia,ffkel0x,t1_ffja8wn,1580021486.0,"We got a Soda Stream and swapped to bubbly water. Back in America, I would get those giant soda barrels from 7-11 (justifying it as ok because it was ""diet"" soda) like Bighead drinks in Silicon Valley and now I often don't finish a single can of soda on the rare occasion I have one. Sugar is an addiction and it's hard to wean off of it, so being able to make sparkling water is a good middle ground to ease away from soda. Moving from America to Australia also helped - corn syrup is used so much back home, so even sodas taste different, and the changed taste plus the more expensive prices help a lot with not craving it.

We cook most of our own food, so that helps a lot, too. There is so much hidden sugar in pre-prepared foods, often to mask bland tastes, while fresh cooking tastes good on its own! The ""downside"" is that now we feel sick if we eat junk, but I don't mind that really. It makes it easier to eat healthy."
australia,ffkbqfd,t3_eu2azh,1580020173.0,"2 years ago on Australia day, I had just landed in Australia and was meeting my boyfriend's family at a big BBQ, while mourning my dad's passing.

australia,ffkaccs,t3_eu2r8p,1580019538.0,"I'm from San Diego and we used to have booze allowed on our beaches and there were lots of bars and clubs which spilled out onto the boardwalk and beach - and it was terrible. Broken glass in the sand, drunks puking and doing dumb shit like putting sand on hot coals which people stepped on, public urination and defecation, fighting, etc.

There are still plenty of beachfront bars and air bnbs for drunken beach days, but the container ban actually helped a lot, as most of the people behaving like this were tourists who had no respect for the area. Locals know where they can still sneakily drink without drama (and lifeguards tend to give people a pass if they are just being chill), but it has made the tourists a lot less horrible.

I might just be getting older, but I think Perth's beaches are lovely. Rottnest is the perfect compromise for me - you can sit at the pub on the beach and relax or have a little cottage right near the water, without dealing with things being too crazy or gross or hectic. Kuta was definitely not my jam, but I'm not a massive party crowd person (went to a huge pool party event in Vegas and didn't enjoy it either)."

I worked my ass of to get on varsity sports teams even though I was fat and uncoordinated from nerve damage. I took college courses at night while still in high school. I did so much stuff I was proud of when I was young.

The entire time my mom fed me bullshit about how I was uppity and ""aggressive with my intelligence"" - she felt threatened by a 15 year old and took it out on me rather harshly. I was smacked if I tried to read books I liked and berated for doing things to further my education - my dad threatened court again if she refused, but she always made it clear she hated my extracurriculars and would find any chance she could to undercut them.

I was only allowed to read her old ""womanly"" books from the 60s, which were these horrible teenage princess versions of Machiavelli. How to win a husband, how to infiltrate a girl's group, just horrid stuff. She constantly forced us into crap like Job's Daughters (Masonic youth organization). She beat me with a hot curling iron because I went to prom without a date.
