I believe that in Vancouver, BC the fishing practice requires the entire shark to be brought to port, which is expensive and usually creates a loss unless you can sell the rest. This makes it no less ethical than any other type of fishing.

But he created a company that created an industry that changed how the world operates. Evolution happens and the stores that left were replaced. Amazon's average employee isnt the minimum wage, nor store front... they are developers and Amazon pays well in that field. And in the wearhouse industry where they lack, they are still leagues higher than most. 

I blame the politicians and the government for operating slower than businesses grew  for a lot of the things people blame Bezos for. I don't think he is a villian, I wouldn't call him a hero.

After the fall of the Empire in episode 6 they started taking kids like Fin and forcing them. Those people never had training. 

We know that Mandalorian  is after the fall, so that can easily mean these Troopers were a gimmick. In true Kylo Ren fashion, they only wore the suits to scare people who didn't know better."

The Clone Troopers had impeccable aim. They were great shots bread and trained for war. Those Storm Troopers existed until Obi Wan retired to Tatooine. 

After the fall of the Empire in episode 6 they started taking kids like Fin and forcing them. Those people never had training. 

We know that Mandalorian  is after the fall, so that can easily mean these Troopers were a gimmick. In true Kylo Ren fashion, they only wore the suits to scare people who didn't know better."
