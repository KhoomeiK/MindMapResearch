csgo,feg2meh,t3_eoykt6,1579074212.0,"I'm sorry, probably part of the problem. I just built a new PC and decided to get back into CS. Last time I seriously played was like 7 or 8 years ago in the 1.6 days. Got a bit warmed up and got through my 10 ranked qualifiers, so they decide to thrust me into Gold 1. I mean I'm decent, but now I'm just holding back teammates in some matches where my skills just aren't there yet."
Justrolledintotheshop,feg2eat,t3_eoyoha,1579073942.0,"Bruh, we put in 10 damage codes on every new ford that comes out of the plant, and that's before we find other damages/defects. Don't buy ford, they treat their cars like absolute shit."

TibiaMMO,fdl3hnq,t3_eigv6n,1578516424.0,"Haven't played tibia since the 8.6ish days, is it still a dull grind to get skills up like it used to be? I'm probably just going to start a new account and I'm not sure which class to go with."
cars,fdkcce1,t3_eltsep,1578500880.0,"This is exactly why I bought my 35th AE GLI... I spent 30k CAD and I get (imo) all the luxury I need with heated/vented comfortable seats, heated steering wheel, nav, backup camera, sensors all around, heated friggen wiper bays, and remote start. I can turn on my dampeneres for a crazy soft ride, or put it in full sport for that full 260hp experience (which is more than you need in a reliable daily). Essentially I'm driving an Audi for a fraction of the price, while everyone is going broke buying 3 or 4 series BMW, 300 mercs and so on.

It also puts a stupid smile on my face when you get some snobby kid in his parents c350 that tries to take you on a dig and gets embarrassed in his overpriced merc, just because it says Mercedes on it."

Thanks for all your help!"
buildapc,fc73b2t,t1_fc6zs0d,1577496402.0,"Yeah same HDMI cable and everything, which is why I'm hoping that it's just a faulty monitor. Someone told me that it could be the screen resolution being too high for my gpu to handle while on 1ms delay as well, but I tried changing it to no avail. I now have to wait a week for them to order in the same monitor :(

If that doesn't work, then I'll be exchanging my rx570 for a 1660 regular, only 100$ difference. Not sure why I didn't just buy the 1660 from the get go lol"
buildapc,fc6rj9t,t1_fc6qc4d,1577487651.0,Sigh.. yeah I'm not sure then. Going to exchange monitor soon and we'll see if that helps.
buildapc,fc6p0y9,t1_fc6nq64,1577485871.0,I switched to windowed and it seems to be fine so far.
buildapc,fc6p01l,t1_fc6nq64,1577485852.0,"Not really, it's more of just a loud static noise. The screen flashes off and on, sometimes white static appears for a second, and sometimes it says input not found or something like that. It's always a random combination of all that.. then it stops all the sudden, I press any button or move the in game camera and it starts freaking out again."
bapcsalescanada,fc3qdiz,t1_fc2n6ho,1577396000.0,"I got there at 845, thought CC opened at 10am as usual but turned out it opened at 8. Waited in line maybe 20 minutes and managed to get every item on my list, which was a full build minus the GPU. Can't complain!"
