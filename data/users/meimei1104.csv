childfree,felncie,t3_eps4tc,1579226299.0,"I don't like children because parents suck at parenting. Most kids are devil spawns who grow up into the adults nobody can stand. And it's the parents fault for not teaching the kids. The parents fault for using their children ""for clout"" as they say. What business does a young child have online? Yeah, show the pics to your family and friends but leave strangers out of it. Too much evil in the world. Why expose your kids to that? Even with people you love you can't be too careful. Look at all the child abusers who are immediate family of the kid they abuse. Gross.

The kids I do like are well behaved. I know they aren't the majority but they are out there."

childfree,fef4fgw,t1_fedvpxu,1579047934.0,"Being cf doesn't mean you can't love children. You just don't want them. Yeah a lot of us can't stand the little brats but, at the end of the day I doubt most would have a problem with a well behaved child that just sits there minding their business. Which means we can always learn to love another child without wanting one. I love the children that start charities or raise money or do something productive that impacts society. Like the kid in the Philippines who started an animal shelter when he was 9. Doesn't mean I'll ever want one. Sadly most kids are insufferable brats (blame the parents for this) that I just cannot stand."

If you're completely CF I don't think you'd be thinking about ""what if"" and it seems to me you're trying to ""scare"" yourself into being truly cf. There are good and bad things to having children. Don't try to force yourself to go either way. If you are sure you are cf then it's not a b8g deal to be on the forum so much. People like us can't go around talking about this because most other people don't understand. Here we gather and rant about the stupidity of the assholes we've dealt with and the shit we go through because of parents who have no business being parents."

uber,feetmlc,t1_feeqsy8,1579040950.0,Trolling much? I don't expect anyone to entertain me. I do expect people to be polite. I hate small talk but even I know manners dictate you at least acknowledge someone you're doing business with.
childfree,feetbbo,t1_fee2foj,1579040759.0,"It's when they don't respect our decision and become assholes about it that most cf people get riled up. It's about the people that are supposed to love you constantly feeling the need to tell you how to live your life and anything that varies from their ideas is deemed unfulfilling. There's just no talking to some people. 

OPs mom is one of the exceptions. She actually understands and respects. Doesn't seem to be pushy or narcissistic. If more cf people dealt with family members like this instead of what most of us get, I'm sure we could get along too.

OP, seems like having you 2 helped your mom in her situation and she feels your life would be fulfilled as was hers. Give her time because it seems she's trying. Especially in small towns it's hard for mentalities to change. Look up groups for hobbies to try. Painting, pottery, artsy stuff. She can make friends and get interested in something new and fun.

Don't be discouraged. Your mom is trying."

uber,feef247,t1_feeeb0h,1579032431.0,Thanks. Yeah he didn't utter a peep from the time he pulled up till the time he dropped me off. I thought maybe he didn't speak English but his profile says he does. I always make sure to check the tag since I'm alone and always get a text saying to do just that. I figured they ask for the same reasons. Been taking uber a lot in the past few weeks and never had this happened.
uber,feeend2,t1_feecb55,1579032184.0,I don't expect them to be my friends or even talk to me once inside. But usually people say hi back or at least ask if I'm the person I'm supposed to be. Got off and said goodbye and thanks and nothing. I hate small talk but manners dictate an acknowledgement of a person that gives me a service. I've seen drivers complain in the uber driver forum that they hate when people don't say hi and bye.

AskReddit,fee8k7i,t3_eopl76,1579028616.0,Gave my mom grapes they had just bought.  My mom has dementia and other mental health issues. We were picking up her meds and I barely just had enough for that. Dementia patients regress to acting like children a lot of the timea. She started somewhat of a tantrum and I was trying to explain I didn't have any money and I'd buy them next month when we get our check (I'm disabled too). She was still crying and I was almost in tears and this nice lady gave her a bunch of grapes and I almost lost it then and there.  People can be assholes in these situations but when you find someone like this it restores my faith in humanity.
