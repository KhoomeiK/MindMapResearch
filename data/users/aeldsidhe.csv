The overarching premise of the story is that this small, underfed little girl, despite her mistreatment throughout her life, grows up to be self-willed, strong of character, proud, kind, intelligent, and independent.  All she ever wanted was to be loved within the context of a family.  Despite having found that with Mr. Rochester and little Adele,her strong sense of self would not let her enter into an immoral marriage that would have eventually eroded all her sense of pride and self-worth.

My favorite lines are when Rochester tells her of his ""impending marriage"" to the cold, cruel, and heartless Blanche:

Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong! - I have as much soul as you, - and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you!
