bulletjournal,ff7k7sx,t3_es11yu,1579651505.0,I agree with the people mentioning the Tekukor! I watched a video on YouTube a couple weeks ago where someone reviewed a handful of 160 gsm notebooks and feel like that one was the best bang for your buck
disneymagickingdoms,ff58ykv,t3_erof7u,1579583796.0,I’d say the event floats. They seem to be cheaper magic-wise to run but still have a chance of earning 5 gems per run. Also they earn event currency during the events which has been super helpful for me in the more recent events since I always seem to be short on EC towards when characters get super expensive.
disneymagickingdoms,ff4fjhn,t3_erl32d,1579562396.0,Definitely! I bought it right before the frozen event and feel like I’ve already made back 55 gems from the extra slot
beyonce,ff1wtg9,t1_ff1liu6,1579487983.0,Everywhere on insta. There’s like hundreds of thousands of fan pages
disneymagickingdoms,fezkl6q,t3_eqx26f,1579458297.0,I only have about 15 maxed characters and I’m at the point in the storyline where I need to welcome Wendy and Tia Dalma. I have always prioritized the storyline and I’m glad I did because I’m at a point where it is taking a while to collect theses character’s tokens so I have a lot of time and magic available to level up and max characters
beyonce,fewmljy,t1_fevl99r,1579414797.0,Supposedly adidas will be restocking in limited quantities but they wouldn’t give an approximate date for this
disneymagickingdoms,feu7krn,t3_eqj4ss,1579383856.0,I remember this and it was always the worst. I think daisy and Donald have a joint task for them as well as Cinderella and Prince Charming but j don’t remember which levels they need to be at
disneymagickingdoms,fet9nxu,t3_eqk8cg,1579373037.0,I know this sounds counterintuitive but using gems to open more parade float slots. You will have a higher chance of earning gems from the parade. It will take a little bit of time for this purchase to be worthwhile but I feel like i definitely get a lot of gems that way
bulletjournal,feortxb,t3_eq61n7,1579304547.0,30 is definitely enough to start and see if you like it. If you can stick with it for the entire notebook then you can reward yourself with a new bigger notebook
bulletjournal,feorhgh,t3_eq7v55,1579304427.0,"I have two notebooks right now. One that I use for tasks as well as anything school related and then another smaller one that’s more personal. If I ever want to journal I will do it in that one and I also include things like my period/health tracker and any shows/movies/books I’m interested in. This helps me separate my daily tasks from anything I don’t want to be mixed in with that. It’s also not too overwhelming because it’s only 2 journals, one that generally stays in my purse and another in my bookbag"
beyonce,feop0t7,t1_femxwr9,1579303360.0,"I actually think four ya been consistently represented in concerts. It’s harder for her to perform a lot of songs from any of her albums because there’s so many. I wish she would sing different songs from 4 though rather than run the world, countdown, I care, and 1+1 because the others are underrated and just as good"
bulletjournal,felkt8a,t3_epsr14,1579224568.0,Zebra mildliners are good! Also the crayola super tips are probably the best bang for you buck and look great too. I’d recommend the 50 rather than the 100 pack. I have the 50 and have never had an issue with not having a color I needed
beyonce,fel8wyk,t3_epqh52,1579216621.0,It is one of my favorite concerts of hers because 4 is my favorite era. Had I been a bigger fan at the time I would have loved to go especially because I live so close
disneyemojiblitz,fei54v7,t3_ep6joi,1579130496.0,Holiday Mickey and Frozone for points but I usually just play with whichever emojis will help with missions
beyonce,fei4nxw,t3_ep79bs,1579130199.0,Check @thebeyonceroom on Instagram. They have been releasing a lot of information. Also @BeyLegion on twitter
bulletjournal,fehcpmn,t3_ep5089,1579113854.0,"This isn’t exactly the same but when I study for exams I usually have a two page spread dedicated to the week before with the exam date at the top. I have a progress meter at the top that I fill in when I finish chapters/practice problems to visualize how far along I have progressed. For the rest of the spread,  I split up what I plan on studying each day and then checking things off as I go"
disneymagickingdoms,fehcg5i,t3_ep5alu,1579113703.0,Enchanting Donald’s boat helps with his tokens. That was the first building I bothered enchanting and it really paid off in leveling him quickly
disneymagickingdoms,fehc2ym,t1_feha1vy,1579113488.0,I like the concept of them especially for new players who couldn’t get everyone but I wish they would have these for characters from all collections throughout the year so the character is guaranteed rather than having to gamble on chests. I would probably buy a few of my favorite characters like this but I would never buy a chest pack
bulletjournal,feh617s,t3_ep4n89,1579109881.0,Currently an Exceed A5 from Walmart and I love it. My mom bought me an Archer and Olive that I’m excited to try when I finish my current journal
disneymagickingdoms,feb6u90,t3_eobmub,1578955947.0,I’m at the same point as you! I have all of bunny’s tokens and almost all of Shere Khan. I just got to Wendy and drops have been bad so far but I’m hoping they get better. I have all of Tia’s ear hats but don’t have anyone to collect for her locket yet so I guess I will be waiting until I have Pan for that
beyonce,fe9w74c,t3_eo5i0v,1578941975.0,"This was a dumb move for the oscars since most nominees will perform at the ceremony and Beyoncé would definitely boost viewer count. Also, the hashtag #oscarssowhite is back this year because they decided to snub a bunch of black artists/actors"
disneymagickingdoms,fe9jfew,t3_eo6aty,1578938151.0,Angel from L&S
bulletjournal,fe6hfr9,t3_enzc26,1578891002.0,Ghosting and bleeding is typically due to the notebook’s paper. Try using lighter colors; I noticed their ghosting tends to be less noticeable
disneymagickingdoms,fdzc5q9,t3_encjeu,1578788710.0,I’m not worried about getting Ren because I think I definitely will but the drop rate for the ear hats has been terrible. I have 3 tasks that can collect for them and have been on the game every hour since he unlocked but have only managed to get 5 ear hats
disneymagickingdoms,fdzc05g,t3_encpq0,1578788616.0,I need 2 lightsabers and 7 ear hats. I even enchanted treadspeeders so the stormtrooper can’t collect the ear hats too but the drops have been terrible :(
disneymagickingdoms,fdmj2yp,t1_fdm9pdp,1578551733.0,I’m not OP but I’d love to see the Nemo characters used in the next TC! Also I’d love for Bambi to finally be used since I feel like once you are done with that storyline there is no use for them
bulletjournal,fdmioja,t1_fdm0nqk,1578551306.0,"It has a key, some index pages (which I don’t really use), a pen test page and a little reflection page at the back but the rest of it is blank dot grid"
disneyemojiblitz,fdlzort,t3_em30gz,1578536345.0,Try Mickey for the last one!
bulletjournal,fdly829,t3_em28n5,1578535341.0,"It depends on what you are looking to do in it. If you are going to be more minimal and only use a black pen then any journal or pen will do but if you are looking to be more artistic then I would recommend the scribbles that matter journal! I’ve loved using it! For pens/markers, I love the zebra mildliner brush pens but a lot of other people suggest tombows. There’s no right or wrong supplies to use so just find stuff you think you will enjoy using"
disneymagickingdoms,fdkng8m,t3_elv7qa,1578507215.0,"I thought the leaderboard you are put in is based on when you first open the app after the mini event starts, not when you start tapping. I am in a relatively easier board this time but I didn’t open the game until around 1 pm the day it started (rather than 10 am when it began)"
bulletjournal,fdkjx0e,t1_fdkizyo,1578505203.0,"It’s a surprise! The bundle includes two random sample products that the company owner had at her house, one of which is definitely a bullet journal. Is really be happy with any of them because they are so pretty but if I had a choice I’d love to have the light blue with the bee on it. Have fun shopping!"
disneymagickingdoms,fdkib6x,t3_elvoc0,1578504409.0,wow you are doing so well! I personally continued on with the Jungle Book storyline during the event but I knew there would be no conflicts. I’d recommend checking the wiki to see what quests are next in the storyline for you (ex welcoming a character vs building a ride) and deciding if you want to risk it based off that information. Also if your goal for the event is just to get Kylo then I feel like you would be fine with a couple of conflicts but if you want to completely finish the event you might want to hold off moving on in the storyline
disneymagickingdoms,fdkgpwa,t1_fdk9x64,1578503512.0,I may be mistaken but I thought yesterday was the last day
disneymagickingdoms,fdkgnsn,t3_eluioj,1578503476.0,I still haven’t gotten Bunny for the same reason. He’s so expensive and is a dead end character so I’ve been using magic for all the jungle books characters and attractions instead. Hopefully now that I’ve reached Wendy I will have a long break collecting her tokens that will allow me to finally get bunny
disneymagickingdoms,fdkgglm,t3_elumud,1578503355.0,I hope so. I’m getting tired of the regular events and miss the luxury of being able to mass level up during TCs as well as earning characters I missed in the past
disneymagickingdoms,fdkg91r,t3_eltc3w,1578503227.0,My guests in SW land are treated to some Mickey waffles haha
bulletjournal,fdkfy23,t3_elvd25,1578503040.0,I ordered one of the sample sale Archer and Olive bundles last weekend and I have been so anxious to receive it! I’m glad you are enjoying your journal and can’t wait to get mine
bulletjournal,fdg7tm4,t3_el7ivj,1578383642.0,Love the Patrick sticker 😂
bulletjournal,fdfku49,t3_el4oio,1578364039.0,it’s really just whatever will be most beneficial to you. I personally put January-May monthly spreads back to back and then go into my weekly spreads. I do this so that when I get my syllabi at the beginning of the semester I can write in the due dates for the whole semester on the monthlys.
disneymagickingdoms,fdfklgr,t3_el4nry,1578363880.0,The Mowgli and Baloo floating in the river animation is my favorite one!
disneymagickingdoms,fdfkc09,t3_el1zu5,1578363711.0,Poe’s “Get up and go” task and also halfway through the battle bots
disneymagickingdoms,fdeykeu,t3_el0i52,1578349342.0,"I’m level 44 and just started the Peter Pan storyline and have been struggling for magic especially during Jungle Book. I used to use events as a way to build it up but lately I’ve needed 500k or more for every attraction, character or plot of land so as soon as I have that much I spend it, never really building up my supply. I guess this is just the way it is now"
disneymagickingdoms,fdey758,t3_el0rkv,1578349113.0,I may be mistaken but I think I saw on the wiki that Finn needs to be level 6 soon after where you are so I’d suggest focusing on leveling him now
disneyemojiblitz,fdd0nk1,t1_fdcq7c4,1578290155.0,Good to know. I don’t spend any money on the game and while I enjoy it I’m not super invested so if I were to lose my progress I’d probably just stop playing
disneyemojiblitz,fdcjzv7,t3_eklr91,1578276797.0,I play without Facebook and haven’t had any trouble in the game. Not sure how much of an advantage it provides but it’s definitely not necessary
bujo,fd9rw82,t3_ekdz3s,1578237242.0,Don’t feel the need to do crazy artistic spreads immediately. Ease your way in so you can get a feel for what you’re doing
bulletjournal,fd5zmwa,t1_fd5zkah,1578183516.0,$45 + shipping!
disneyemojiblitz,fd5yoft,t3_ek4vbr,1578183168.0,Use an emoji from any of the series boxes!
bulletjournal,fd5yhog,t1_fd5oz07,1578183101.0,ooh I’ll make sure to check then! I got lucky and was on Instagram and saw the sale almost immediately and I’m so happy. It seems like a great deal and it will be my first A&O!
bulletjournal,fd5lx78,t3_ek2fof,1578178883.0,I’m jealous of your A&O! The bee design is my favorite but everytime I go to buy it it’s sold out. I bought the sample sale today and am hoping that the bee notebook is one of the designs in my set
bulletjournal,fd5fbpl,t3_ek2xi0,1578177063.0,Walmart has the exceed brand which is 100 gsm and pretty decent for the price. If you are looking for something nicer and a bit pricier then I’d say amazon is the best option
disneymagickingdoms,fd30j73,t3_ejtw2j,1578153592.0,I have all the tokens but only 11k EC so I will be farming magic for the rest of the day 🙃
bulletjournal,fd0py7h,t3_ejpldz,1578122182.0,Sleep and how much water I drink
disneyemojiblitz,fcw3j7o,t1_fcw0bwq,1578016316.0,I do this too!
bulletjournal,fcvjssa,t1_fcvjowa,1578003603.0,awesome thanks so much! :)
bulletjournal,fcvjhqu,t3_ej59wt,1578003414.0,Which pens do you use in this? I just bought a black out scribbles that matter and have not decided on pens yet
beyonce,fctf75h,t3_eirmr1,1577941329.0,Don’t forget ivy park this month too!
bulletjournal,fcnl0bn,t3_ei5o7e,1577813571.0,I use the same weekly spread for the whole year but that’s simply because I’ve found it to be the most effective one for me
bulletjournal,fckizsv,t3_ehkb2a,1577726381.0,"I have a music of the month and tv episode of the month where I pick my favorites at the end of each month and write them down! I’ve noticed trends in the past where if I’m binge watching a long show, the season finales will show up multiple months in a row. It also helps me give recommendations for good music and shows"
bulletjournal,fckipgn,t3_ehkmxw,1577726199.0,Just draw an extra line through every month and track in the morning and at night to see days where your mood changed!
disneymagickingdoms,fcj5jhm,t3_ehgie9,1577677797.0,If you just started I’m not sure if it’s really possible to get everything from the Star Wars event :( I’d recommend looking at the pinned FAQ wiki for a lot of help and good luck with the game
disneymagickingdoms,fcj58m3,t1_fcj4jrp,1577677583.0,I’m not sure if this is what you mean but it’s better to have 5 characters all at level 5 rather than 1 character at 10 and 4 characters at level 2-3. I’d recommend leveling up the short ones first and only do long ones when sleeping or if you know you will be away from the game
disneymagickingdoms,fcj3d5d,t1_fcj0hxs,1577676255.0,Mickey and friends and toy story are used every TC! Otherwise I’d recommend just leveling as many of the characters as you can
bulletjournal,fcj3a6n,t3_ehffr3,1577676198.0,I just started a new one even though there were some pages left in last years. I plan on using those pages for my senior thesis since a lot of my research sources and notes and are listed in there but will use my new one for everyday bujoing
bulletjournal,fci89v1,t3_ehch4g,1577658939.0,Yes I don’t really use it when I’m home from college on break. I know that I do this and have adjusted my spreads to not include weeklys for these days and also don’t get discouraged if I stop filling out trackers these days. If there is a day I want to journal I will switch to dailies over breaks. Hope this helps you :)
bulletjournal,fci78ss,t1_fci6egi,1577658566.0,Here’s my [series tracker](https://www.reddit.com/r/bulletjournal/comments/eh1jfj/2020_series_tracker_that_took_me_way_too_long_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). I put a score from 1-5 next to the last episode of the season once it’s done!
bulletjournal,fcgehuz,t1_fcge8pp,1577639171.0,thank you! it will probably be one of my most used pages so i made sure to make it look perfect
bulletjournal,fcge5ju,t1_fccrrur,1577639051.0,"This took me a few days to do because I would get tired and bored with the squares, give up and then come back to it."
bulletjournal,fcge1pa,t1_fcfm5ss,1577639013.0,The grey zebra mildliner! I am not artistic at all so I told myself until I can improve on my lettering and art I’m not going to buy any fancy/expensive markers but I’ve liked how my 2020 looks so far in this style
bulletjournal,fcbz4gv,t3_eh00pg,1577592582.0,"Get a new one and use the old one for planning new spreads, making grocery lists, scrapbook, etc!"
beyonce,fc9iyix,t1_fc8xcoh,1577553348.0,ST is my favorite of all decades. It’s my fav by far
disneymagickingdoms,fc7pp2d,t1_fc7kofq,1577515374.0,when you enchant both tokens are available! For example I just enchanted the X wing Star Wars ride. At level 0 it dropped one of Hux’s tokens but now that it’s level 1 I have the chance of getting either token. I hope it this answers your question!
beyonce,fc7d1zf,t3_egfy52,1577503866.0,I’m honestly more mad that Beck won over Self Titled. That was a masterpiece from the surprise release to the completely different sound and lyrical composition for Beyoncé as well as it being completely visual too 😭
bulletjournal,fc7cnaq,t1_fc6wnzc,1577503535.0,Two page spreads are common however I don’t really use them and honestly would prefer a pretty journal like this to the ones where it lines up
bulletjournal,fc7chu9,t3_egj97p,1577503413.0,I make a series tracker where I keep track of shows I’m watching on Netflix and once I’m done a season I will fill in a star rating of it!
bulletjournal,fc6cubc,t3_egel7v,1577477568.0,There is some ghosting; I used it last year. It’s not really bad but if you are looking to avoid ghosting completely I would recommend a different journal. The pages in the Leuchttrum are super thin and even my regular black pens ghost
disneymagickingdoms,fc60lco,t3_egcwc5,1577469620.0,Legendary chests are calendar rewards throughout the year too and I’ve gotten quite a few of the characters that way
bulletjournal,fc60bye,t3_egdm3k,1577469482.0,I’ve done this with movies and tv shows I want to watch and have found that when I finish a show on Netflix I don’t go through a week or two period where I can’t find something new to watch!
disneymagickingdoms,fc604we,t3_egdppu,1577469380.0,I got the X Wing today and decided to enchant that so it will drop both Hux tokens
bujo,fc60203,t3_egdr3z,1577469337.0,I create all the first 6 monthlys at the beginning of my journal so that I can write down any exams or due dates for school in advance and it’s really helpful. I then do a 6 month future log for the rest of the year since I typically have less to write down that far in advance. Not sure if this helps but this is a method I’ve found to be more successful rather than waiting to do the monthly until the month is here
bulletjournal,fc5zkf8,t3_eg6j0h,1577469080.0,Cherry blossoms is a popular February theme
bulletjournal,fc5zhwn,t3_eg6qse,1577469041.0,"My first bujo was really experimental and I had random pages throughout and still loved it. A lot of the pages in the beginning I don’t really use (index, future log) so even though you see them in a lot of other bujos doesn’t mean you have to do it that way. Just have fun with your journal and make it so that you want to and love to use it"
bulletjournal,fc5z6s6,t1_fc4qzrw,1577468875.0,I’ve never thought about doing something like this but I might have to steal this idea!! This seems like a perfect way to make my bujo cohesive throughout the year while still having variation each month :)
disneymagickingdoms,fc1v3xq,t1_fc1pb3v,1577330656.0,Me too!
disneymagickingdoms,fbvp6vo,t3_eeq2hf,1577134057.0,I have a lot of the premium characters and some are better than others. Pluto is used in most TCs and also drops a lot of character tokens so I’d suggest getting him. Others are only useful for their own collection’s tokens. I’d say any premium characters are better than gambling on chests but that’s just my opinion since I never seem to get anything good when I spend gems on the chests
