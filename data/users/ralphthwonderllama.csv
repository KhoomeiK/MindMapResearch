>Low-income taxpayers pay not just lower taxes overall, but a lower percentage of their income within this tax system.

>	Say you’re single with no dependents, and your taxable income is $9,000.

>Your marginal tax rate, according to the Federal Income Tax Brackets chart below, is 10 percent. You pay $900 in income tax. That’s simple.

Actually, [the way the DNC convention/nomination process works is](https://ballotpedia.org/Democratic_delegate_rules,_2020):

1) People vote in individual states, and delegates are awarded PROPORTIONATELY to each candidate based on how well they do. It's not a winner-take-all system like the GOP does.

2) If no candidate obtains over 51% of the delegates (1,990) from the people's voting in the primaries, then a 2nd ballot is called at the convention. The Superdelegates are allowed to vote on this 2nd ballot. 

3) Superdelegates are party elites, current/former public officials, etc. Superdelegate votes count the same as 10,000 normal ""people"" votes. So, for every Superdelegate vote, that counts the same (according to the DNC) as 10,000 ""people"" votes. Their opinion is worth 10,000x more than your opinion, apparently.

4) So, if the 771 Superdelegates vote en-masse for Biden, it would easily put him over the 51% of the necessary 2,375 delegates to win the nomination, AGAINST the wishes of the PEOPLE."

Fine. You want a lesson, I'll teach you a lesson.

[The effects](https://vittana.org/how-poverty-influences-crime-rates) that poverty has on crime can be explained in multiple ways. For starters, there is a higher rate of untreated mental illness that is in populations struggling with poverty compared to wealthier populations. Now most people who struggle with a mental illness will never commit a crime, but there are some types of severe mental illness which increase the risk of an individual committing a crime.

Untreated severe mental illnesses are particularly significant when looking at links between poverty and homicide. On the other end of the spectrum, those who are mentally ill are also victimized by violent crime at much higher levels than the general population.

Yet despite these facts, the number of beds at mental health hospitals and treatment facilities are lower in the United States today than they were in 1850.

But a mental illness isn’t the only link that there is between poverty and crime. Being in poverty often leads to high levels of stress. An overwhelming desire to meet certain basic needs becomes the highest priority. Over time, if those needs cannot be met, then some individuals will commit robberies, burglaries, and other forms of them. It can also lead to violent acts, though in the mind of the perpetrator, the actions are seen as a method of self-defense.

Poverty also creates fewer opportunities, some of which co-exist with mental illness and a lack of being able to meet basic needs. If an individual is struggling with an untreated mental illness, then it is difficult for them to hold down an employment opportunity. Without a job, it is difficult to find money to meet basic needs.

A lack of resources also creates inferior educational opportunities for households in poverty, some actual and some admittedly perceived. Yet the perception of a lack of education is enough for individuals in poverty to create self-fulfilling prophecies regarding their future. Because they believe there aren’t good quality schools out there, then there aren’t good quality jobs out there. People feel the need to fight for themselves.

This leads to the creation of gangs and gang affiliation. Then the cycle continues to perpetuate itself again and again. Crime is simply a means to an end. It’s a way to obtain what is needed without a legitimate means to do so because it seems like there isn’t a legitimate opportunity to avoid crime.

It’s a cycle that feeds upon itself. And often the prize of a successful crime outweighs the risk of being caught, which further increases the crime rate in areas of poverty.

In a free-market society, a common belief regarding poverty is that each person is responsible for their own circumstances. It’s a stereotype that has fed more stereotypes, such as the idea that drug and alcohol use is more prevalent amongst households in poverty. It is true that one of the risk factors for drug use is poverty.

The same is true for alcoholism. Yet the stereotype is that the risk factor not only applies to everyone in poverty, but that everyone is struggling with some form of addiction. If they could only get a job, they would be fine.

And since drug use and public alcohol use is often illegal, these activities then contribute to the local crime rate.

In reality, the problem comes back to the stresses that occur when a household or individual is living in poverty. Not being able to have a basic need met, like knowing when your next meal will be or what it will be, can lead people to a breaking point. They seek out any relief that they can find. Many times, that relief ends up being in a bottle or a needle.

Stress relief also involves risky decisions to alleviate, if but for a moment, what poverty is placing upon an individual. It’s the reason why risky sexual encounters are accepted in poverty-stricken areas. That brief monetary reward is enough to purchase another fix that can help someone forget where they are. Then they repeat the behavior because the reward of forgetting is worth the risk of future health problems or getting caught.

Setting all stereotypes aside, poverty influences crime rates because at its core, it highlights and reinforces the differences between the wealthy class and those who are poor. The greater the gap happens to be, then the greater the benefits are to a thief to use that wealth in some way to their own advantage.

This socioeconomic gap is seen in many different ways in our society today.

- Children who come from homes in poverty are more likely to be expelled from school or to have a police record than a child who makes the same choices as the poor child, but has more overall wealth.

- Societies that have age gaps are also prone to more crime when poverty is a factor in the community. This is because of the number of possessions that elderly households are perceived to have, along with the natural vulnerability which comes with age.

- Communities which have a higher percentage of inhabitants that are under the age of 25 may also lead to higher crime rates, especially if there are large socioeconomic gaps between different households of that age group.

It is these differences which also encourage a higher overall crime rate in minority populations in the United States. Many minority households live in urban areas and may have built-in struggles with poverty for multiple generations. In a 1995 survey of US metropolitan areas with unemployed rates of 12% or more, the population was composed of at least 30% minority households.

Yet socioeconomic gaps also create the potential for crime within communities that are struggling with poverty. These gaps are just not always associated with money. If someone is bigger and stronger than someone else, then they may choose to take a weaker person’s resources. Business owners may take advantage of the desperation of poverty and offer jobs with wages well below legal limits.

There are even precedents of having local law enforcement officials extorting money from those who are in poverty, which then creates a lack of functional restraint on the crime that exists in these areas."
