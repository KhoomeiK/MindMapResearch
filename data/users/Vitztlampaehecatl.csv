This is what we in the business of arguing about politics online like to call a *systemic problem*. Regardless of the leader's personal morals, there are things that you *must* do, many of which are bad, or else you'll be deposed by your opponents. Even if the leader was Jesus himself, it would be impossible for him to fill the position without doing bad things. The system must be changed before ethical behavior is allowed.

That would be a big red flag if the abuser won't let the patient give a urine sample when the doctor asked for it. 

>2) if their partner does use the restroom, check on if they ""called for help"" before nurses/doctors could get to it

It would also be a red flag if the abuser insists on being in the bathroom while the patient is giving the urine sample. 

>3) if the doctor ever asks the abuser to leave the room for any reason they would suspect it and punish their partner (regardless of if they called for help or not)

This one is actually a significant concern, but there is a way to avoid it- the doctor would have to do something to protect the patient from the abuser even after the appointment. 

>4) the victim knows if they call for help and their partner is asked to leave the room that their abuser might know something's up, and thus purposely not do it of their own accord. in fact it may strike fear in them if the doctor asks the abuser to leave for ANY reason because they would be scared about being punished later (a la point #3)

Also a valid concern
