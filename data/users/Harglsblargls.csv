OurPresident,ffvk0dy,t3_evc2wx,1580265926.0,"Why? Is he going to sprinkle magic hippy dust around the Oval Office and suddenly all healthcare will be free for everyone? 

You people have no idea how the world works. I wish I still had your childlike sense of wonder.

To be clear, I'm voting for him because I like the guy, but none of this fairy tale bullshit is going to happen."
depression,ffqcynu,t3_euerrc,1580130757.0,I've been numb for so long my old friends wouldn't recognize me. No outward emotion.

depression,ff26ud0,t3_er0lvl,1579495475.0,Yup. I don't have the energy to see my therapist anymore. They called and said they won't renew my Lexapro unless i make an office appointment. I guess that means no more drugs. This should get interesting.
SandersForPresident,ff1xcpo,t1_ff1wpk5,1579488331.0,Oh. Thank you. I feel pretty stupid now.

depression,fezxfi7,t1_fey3ipt,1579462945.0,"I think you might be fortunate in that regard. I long for total apathy. Ironically, I think that's the only thing I have hope for. Has your apathy dulled the sadness or anxiety?"
PS4,fewfuux,t3_eqq2pg,1579409897.0,"Rdr 2 wins on a purely technical level, but I think if you factor in things like unique art styles, original environments, etc. God of War gets the nod for me."
depression,few9jzr,t1_few1hfq,1579407179.0,"Anyone who tells you they have nothing to learn from a teenager is full of shit. We all lead different lives, and our own unique experiences inform how we perceive the world around us. Your analogy of ""the light switch"" for example, was excellent, and describes perfectly how I feel about my mom. I hope you have better luck in your future than I did. 

If you find something that makes you happy, hold on to it like your life depends on it."
depression,few8cll,t1_few33a1,1579406830.0,Interesting perspective. I'll have to give that some thought.

Games,fd2lthm,t3_ejtziv,1578149051.0,"This happens to me about once a year. Just put the games to the side and do something else. Read (or reread) a series of books, go through your movie collection, just do something else for a while. Eventually you'll feel like playing a game again, and you'll find your passion for it is back. Just don't force it."

Thank God you're here to tell me these things. I'm so fucking tired of the constant shit show that is politics.

He's an idealistic buffoon, who gets his rocks off by you lot circle jerking every time he opens his gob to promise you the world. If you actually manage to get him elected, we'll all learn the true meaning of partison gridlock. It'll make Obama's last year in office look like a Democratic orgy."
