Humble Whatever-they're-calling-it-now is a great value for someone in my situation as long as you don't mind playing games a year or two after they came out.

I guess you could say that there are some big titles I wouldn't have tried at all without the bundle such as Destiny 2.  They've been kind of hit or miss really, but they aren't why I subscribe anyway.  It's more for the mid-tier stuff like Yakuza that I subscribe."

Maybe it's the clown mascot, or your second cousin got sick, and you think it's McDonalds' fault.  Maybe your reason is wholly justified, and maybe it's bullshit.  Either way, you hate the real estate they take up, you hate the business they take away from what you consider to be superior burger joints, and you hate that there are people that seem to genuinely enjoy their food for some unfathomable reason.  

You organize protests, rile up burgerphiles, generate news articles and scathing reviews of questionable veracity, and in general take every opportunity to make it seem like there is some great discontent with the continued existence of McDonalds.  Suddenly, some other corporation has some beef (heh) with McDonalds and files a lawsuit that, if successful, could genuinely harm or even cripple the profitable operations of the burger chain.

You immediately latch onto any news, analysis or rumors about the proceedings.  In your heavily biased perspective, it's *obvious* that McDonalds is in the wrong here, and you constantly crow about how they're going down for sure this time.  You do this for months in various online communities.

But then it all falls apart.  One by one, the claims against McDonalds are found to be meritless, and it seems that McDonalds may come out of this unscathed.  Now, you have a few options.

The only real reason to have a large party in an D&D CRPG is if there is a large cast of interesting NPCs to recruit.  Then it cuts down on the number of replays necessary to experience all the content, and 6 man parties in D&D *can* work if encounters are designed around them.

But the three things you quoted are - in my opinion - weird ones to expect.  I mean, I don't *agree* with people that want Larian to switch from the turn-based style of game design they've been successful at to RTwP, but I understand why people want or expect it.  But of the three you quoted from me:

* there's no way that WotC would allow an edition of D&D other than the one they're currently publishing to be used, much less one from before they even owned the IP.
* there's nothing left to tell about the Bhaalspawn; their story is finished.  Additionally, we're dealing with a completely different developer with a completely different team of writers.  Not sure why anyone would even *want* old characters to be brought forward if it isn't the same people writing them.
* The same thing about the edition of the rules applies to the timeline of the writing.  When the edition changed, the canon timeline moved forward, and all of the people writing for WotC moved forward with it.  Current canon is about 100 years after the events of Baldur's Gate due to the Spellplague in 4E.

I've said it before in this thread, but to me, the important thing is that they make a good game that uses the D&D ruleset, because more than anything else, *that* is what defined Baldur's Gate to me.  Yes, I loved the characters, but their story is done.  But we haven't had a D&D game that was actually D&D in how long?  That's what I want, and if they have to hang a well known title on the cover of the box to ensure sales, so be it."
Games,fen8ix3,t1_fen4urc,1579279301.0,"> In which place, unless you’re just cashing in on the nostalgia and fan hype by taking the title, what do you have left if nothing, not the story, nor the gameplay follow the previous games?

Umm...  yes?  Why do you *think* WotC licensed out the title of a series that already has a definitive ending and didn't really leave any room or need for further development?  Obviously it's the name recognition.  It's the same reason that the Dark Alliance games had the title.  To sell copies to people who recognized the name.  

Honestly, reel in any expectations that Baldur's Gate 3 is going to have anything in common with the old series other than D&D and the Sword Coast setting.  There's no reason to expect that it will based on who WotC chose to develop it.  If they wanted RtwP, why not go with Obsidian or Owlcat, both who have made RTwP games with comparable critical reception and sales?  And seeing that they *did* go with Larian, why would they then hamstring them by telling to make the game completely different from how they made their successful games?

*Could* Larian throw everyone for a loop and make a game in a style they haven't before?  Sure.  They could also pull a Salvatore and bring back all of our favorite NPCs to pull on those nostalgia strings or find some way to continue the Bhaalspawn storyline or even just say fuck the canon timeline and place the game in the same general era of the originals.

What I *think* they're going to do, though, is just make the best game they can, put it in the Sword Coast region, and call it Baldur's Gate because no one pays any attention when you call your game ""Sword Coast Legends.""  And honestly, if the game turns out to be good - and I have no reason to believe they aren't capable of making that happen - then I'll be happy to actually have a good D&D game again no matter what they call it."

Baldur's Gate revolved around the fate of a single character, the Bhaalspawn.  I don't expect Larian to bring that character back as the main protagonist as his/her story is complete. 

Baldur's Gate took place ~~during~~ shortly after the Time of Troubles.  I don't expect Larian to keep the game in that time as canon events have since moved on.

There are many things that someone in the late 90s or early 00s would expect of a Baldur's Gate game that wouldn't hold true today.  Baldur's Gate used RTwP, but the upcoming game has been taken up by a developer known for their turn-based RPGs, and due to that, and as D&D itself is also a turn-based RPG, I don't expect Larian to make a RTwP game just because that's what would have happened if Bioware had made BG3 instead of Neverwinter Nights in the 00s."

DanMachi,fecs7bh,t1_fecnx6b,1578982605.0,"Yes, but Lili and Haruhime aren't the only ones who quit their old familias to join Hestia.  When you also consider Welf and Mikoto's circumstances, it forms less of a lazy pattern and more of a spectrum of circumstances that Gale Wind fits into.  She is like the former two in that her familia has no ties to Hestia herself and that she has no current business with her old familia(aside from settling up with the goddess herself), and she's like the latter two in that her greatest reason for leaving would be her relationship with Bell(sense of friendship for Welf and debt for Mikoto).

The other ingredient that they all have in common is a catalyst for change that gives the push to switch familias.  In Mikoto and Welf, it was the War Game, in Lili it was the kidnapping, in Haruhime it was her near death and the departure of her goddess.  In Gale Wind, it is blatantly spelled out that she her experience with Bell in the deep levels made her shift from looking back at her old life with despair to looking at her current and future life with hope.  At the moment, that puts her firmly in camp Benevolent Mistress, but since the other thing she came to realize was that she was falling in love with Bell, we're basically one narrative push away from her joining camp Hestia.

I'd expect sometime in the coming novels to deal with her conflict between her growing feelings for Bell and her sense of debt to Syr specifically and the Benevolent Mistress in general.  I also imagine that we might actually see some of her correspondence with Astrea going forward, and then a brief appearance from the goddess herself, possibly just to release Gale Wind and possibly to evaluate Bell.  That, and maybe some event that necessitates a sudden increase in Hestia familia's combat ability that forces Gale Wind to make a decision, though I don't think that's really necessary like it was with Welf and Mikoto.

As for the Benevolent Mistress joining Astrea familia instead of Gale Wind leaving it, there's just nothing at all that points toward that as a possibility.  If her joining Hestia familia isn't a lego block fit to how other adventurers joined, one faction changing whole cloth into another faction is basically bad fan fiction.  I'd sooner expect to see the Guild transform into Ouranos familia than that(and I don't expect that at all).

It also doesn't make much narrative sense to change an existing faction that now has significant worldbuilding put into it(the Benevolent Mistress) into another entirely tangential faction that existed (past tense) for almost the sole purpose of providing the same kind of backstory that other major characters surrounding Bell got.  Basically, Astrea famila is to Gale Wind what Soma famila was to Lili or Ishtar familia to Haruhime:  part of her tragic past that she had to overcome in order to grow as a person and also somehow fall in love with Bell.

Lili is probably due a level gain up to 2, but I would be somewhat surprised to see Welf gain another level during the course of the novels, let alone see Lili get *two* levels.  Bell's growth is a severe anomaly, and the closest we see to that in adventurers without his growth-boosting skill is Aiz herself, and even she took nearly a year to gain her first level-up.  Most adventurers take multiple years to gain each level, even within combat-focused familias like Loki.

This series has taken place in less than the span of 6 months.

I would assume the more likely occurrence is that either Haruhime gets better with her level-boost magic or that as Hestia familia starts going deeper into the dungeon, they start getting assistance either through the Xenos or through alliances like how Loki familia made a deal with Hephaestus in Sword Oratoria.  

As for Gale Wind joining, I would say the better indication would be when Bell hits level 5, and probably when the Evils elements of Sword Oratoria start spilling into the main series more since that's a major driving force for her."

Spellcasting is central to everything in that game.  The spellcaster stands in the center of the formation and sings, either building up to a massive attack or channeling buffs, debuffs and healing while their mana drains(after which they need to rest to recharge).  In all cases, the longer the spellcaster sings, the more powerful the magic effect gets.

The rest of the party acts either as the primary or secondary source of damage depending on how you're using magic, as a buffed party can be very effective, but attack magic can outdamage them by multiple orders of magnitude when charged up for long enough.

Another role the party takes is that of defense, as the spellcaster is completely defenseless, and a single attack will break their concentration.  You always get an indication when an attack targeting the spellcaster is coming, so it's usually not hard to defend unless you're already reeling from a previous attack."

Missing.  The.  Fucking.  Point.  

Skills are **EITHER** handed down as part of the class container that Heroic Spirits are constrained to when summoned **OR** representative of the skills the Heroic Spirit had in life.  So allow me to slightly reword what you just posted so you can see how stupid it sounds.  Hold my thesaurus.

>And as said before, Projection is a skill that Emiya possesses, it's not a skill like PFA or Mana Burst . 

Projection is a fucking skill because it's something that Emiya was *skilled* at to the point that he developed a goddamned Reality Marble around it.  Hawkeye is the same even if its more understated and underutilized in the source material for plot related reasons.  Basically, there were two things in life that the Heroic Spirit Emiya excelled at:  creating near perfect projections of weapons(mostly swords) and effortlessly hitting anything he aimed at with a bow if he felt like it(despite the fact that he was also pretty apathetic about bows in general).  Those two upgraded skills are meant to reflect that so that Emiya in the game resembles Emiya in the visual novel he features in. 

This is *exactly* what OP was asking for when he complained that Hector's skills are just generic class skills(though this is somewhat undermined by the fact that Hector is the only Servant with Proof of Friendship that I know of).  Skills that actually speak to what made that Heroic Spirit special in life instead of just what his class container grants him.  All of the new Servants coming out have stuff like this(such as Eresh's ""Blessing of Kur""), but a lot of the older Servants don't, and they come off as lackluster and generic as a result."
