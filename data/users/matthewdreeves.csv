AskReddit,ff9zv3y,t1_ff9zf3t,1579725036.0,"One definition of blackmail is "" the use of threats or the manipulation of someone's feelings to force them to do something""

Teaching someone that if they don't conform to a certain set of standards, such as remaining a virgin while unmarried, that they'll be kicked out of the religion and their friends and family won't talk to them anymore, is threat and manipulation.  


And I didn't say they convince your family that you are dead. I said they convince your friends and family to pretend that you're dead, as in, walk past you at the kingdom hall or grocery store as if you are not there.

So, where is the lie?"
AskReddit,ff9r1dd,t1_ff9oh25,1579719156.0,"In my original comment, I was making no particular statement about whether or not good people exist with the Jehovah's Witness organization.

When I said ""They blackmail you"", I meant the organization itself. I followed that with ""by convincing your friends and family to pretend you're dead"". I would argue that if the organization didn't mandate shunning, most folks probably wouldn't choose to do it. As a species, we generally use shunning as a nuclear option, such as when a fellow human  is a physical danger to the folks around them.

But Jehovah's Witnesses, Scientologists, Fundamentalist Mormons, and several other groups sort of 'weaponize' the concept of shunning for two purposes.

1. To pressure the person who they've decided needs shunning to re-conform.
2. To serve as a warning to the other members to continue to conform.

The individuals doing the shunning are convinced that doing so is something their God advocates, and that the ""tough-love"" approach will make the erring person ""return to reason"" and re-conform to the group ideology. In that way, most of them mean well. They think they're doing something good.

Long story short, I'm not claiming that individual Jehovah's Witnesses are bad. Far from it. They, like many human beings, are generally good and decent.

Most of my family are JWs, and I'd argue that most of them are kind, decent people.

This doesn't change the fact that the act of shunning is demonstrably cruel and a terrible way to convince a person that they should have certain beliefs. It's scientifically proven to be psychologically harmful to ostracize a person from a social group and should only be done in extreme, rare cases where that individual is an actual danger to the people around them.

Now I know a JW would argue that a disfellowshipped person is a danger to their fellow believers, but I would argue that the logic they use for this is faulty in 99% of the cases. Is the person a murderer or a child molester or an abusive spouse? Then fine, I can understand cutting that person off.

But a sixteen year old who had sex with a classmate? A person struggling with alcoholism? A married person who cheated on their spouse? A person who outspokenly no longer believes in the religion? A person who can't break the habit of smoking cigarettes? A person with a gambling problem? These are just a fraction of ""disfellowshipping"" offenses. Is it the right thing to do, to cut a person off so completely that you won't even take their phone call or look them in the eye when you see them? I'd argue that these are occasions where folks need more love and attention, not less. It's inhumane to treat people this way.

It's terrible that people have been hoodwinked into thinking this is a good thing. Does it make them personally bad for conforming, not necessarily. Not when they are personally threatened with the same consequences should they not conform.

Anyhow, tldr, I never said JWs are bad. The original question was what places are easy to enter but hard to exit. And in my personal opinion, leaving a group like JWs is hard, because it often involves leaving most if not all of your social circle. Whether or not the people in the religion are good or bad is an entirely different conversation."

AskReddit,ff9f420,t1_ff8rgmn,1579711665.0,"When a baptized witness decides they no longer believe, or they get punished with disfellowshipping for breaking one of the many rules, witnesses are instructed to not speak to that person, not accept calls from them or call them, not respond to their texts or emails, and not associate with them in any way. If they come to the kingdom hall, people don't make eye contact with them and act as if they simply are not there.  


So I ask you, where is the lie in my original description? For all intents and purposes, they're acting like the person doesn't exist, or as though they're dead."
AskReddit,ff9eocy,t1_ff9bcae,1579711392.0,">This makes it sound like they're all 'in on it' and are continuously and actively faking it :-) I can promise you that's not the case. Although, there's probably a nutcase like that in every congregation. For the most part, they just try to be good human beings, being generally nice and cordial to everybody.

Where in my sentence did I say ""they're all in on it and are continuously and actively faking it""? You're putting words in my mouth.

They're literally trained to put their best foot forward and give a good witness to non-witnesses. And if you were never baptized, you're a non-witness. The fact that you were associated with the group, and clearly maintain a generally favorable attitude toward it, is cause for them to believe that you could potentially return and become a member. So they remain cordial to you with that hope. 

>The couple I mentioned were both baptized.

Yes, but you mentioned almost no details about their lives, and you're relating an anecdotal, second or third hand story. You gave no pertinent details, probably because you're simply not privy to them. Besides, your example is irrelevant because divorce without biblical cause is not considered a disfellowshippable offense. It's just a bad example to prove your point. 

>Tbh, whenever I see something about JW's, it's usually very hateful stuff. It's like people just don't want to know that there are mostly kind people in those congregations, trying to live a meaningful life.

Again, this is anecdotal and proves nothing either way. At minimum, let's agree that both of our opinions on this point are just that, opinions.

>No, but I've heard there are investigations into child abuse in my country as well. I think that's a good thing. As I mentioned before, there are bad people everywhere, and a religion should be a safe place. So yes, let's actively search for people who do bad stuff, and punish them. But let's not pretend there aren't bad people in other religions too. The pot and the kettle... :-)

What does my pointing out that they have a problem with child abuse have to do with other religions? When did I mention other religions?"
AskReddit,ff99qmd,t1_ff95hpg,1579708075.0,"Well, I'm glad you got away relatively unharmed. This is often true of folks who don't get baptized. They can just go live their lives, and the JWs will generally remain nice and cordial to them, because they hope you'll change your mind one day, so they keep trying to give a good witness to you.

However if you are baptized, and decide you no longer believe, or get punished with disfellowshipping for breaking one of the many, many, many rules, such as sex before marriage, that's when the hateful shunning kicks in.

However on the whole, I'd argue that in fact, it's neither the negative stories nor the positive ones about JWs that get published. Mostly, they simply don't get talked about at all. 

But when bad stuff does come out, it's really, really bad stuff usually. Have you heard of the Australian Royal Commission regarding Child Abuse?"
AskReddit,ff945jd,t1_ff93ih4,1579704403.0,"I'd like to think that as well. Who knows? I just know what their official rules are, and have been for many decades. They demonize anyone who stops believing, and anyone they deem worthy of ""disfellowshipping"". And they are officially mandated to shun these individuals. So if they weren't doing that in your congregation, they were going against one of the main tenets of the religion, which if you're truly familiar with the belief system and the people, you'd know it's highly, highly unusual for individual JWs to go against such a cardinal rule, let alone entire congregations."

My initial thought on her response is that it might have been said reactively, out of anger or irritation to what she might have perceived as you implying that she's being unkind or unfair to her friend. Many people tend to react thoughtlessly when someone is pointing out a flaw in their reasoning or actions. Some people take any criticism as a personal attack.

That being said, while I obviously can't be certain that in this particular circumstance she said this out of anger, it's likely something she's said in the past and it's likely something she claims to believe, since this is a common viewpoint a believer holds when a loved one stops believing.

But taking a step back, I'd suggest that the way she and the rest of your family are acting may not necessarily be out of a lack of love or concern. Perhaps it's because they're boxed into a starkly black and white worldview that makes it so that they're literally baffled and confused by anything that challenges it. They simply don't know how to react, especially when presented with cognitive dissonance. It seems like the typical response is either A: Anger, or B: Avoidance.

They literally have no logical response to the arguments you present, and they simply have no idea what to do with you. Does this mean they don't love you? Not necessarily, although it's certainly possible. I'm just saying that something so completely out of their wheelhouse a the concept of a person willingly choosing to not be a JW can create a 'deer in the headlights' emotional response, since they almost can't even comprehend it.

All that being said, you obviously know your relationship and I'm a stranger who knows nothing about it, and at the end of the day, we each have to be the authors of our own limited happiness. I guess I'm simply saying, perhaps one shouldn't necessarily take the words, actions, or non-actions that are tinged by their belief system at face value, because it's quite a complicated situation psychologically."
