The agar will be officially set in 2 hours, but I’m probably at least a couple days out before I’ll be able to test it out. Will 5-6 days after initial inoculation of LC be sufficient to test it out or should I wait a little longer. I have grain bags coming in a couple days and wanted to use LC to reduce colonization time, if it’s viable and intelligent option."
