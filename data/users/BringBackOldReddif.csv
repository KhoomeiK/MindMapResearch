dankmemes,ff441w0,t1_ff3nm25,1579555075.0,"I’m the same way. Somebody recently told me, “don’t talk bad about yourself. That stupid little voice in your head is a liar. Don’t listen.” I thought that was nice. 

Good luck."
politics,ff3jeht,t1_ff3dx3i,1579542311.0,I also downvoted based solely on your whining about downvotes.
GameSale,ff26mfe,t1_ff264gg,1579495292.0,Don’t say “we” you certainly don’t speak for all the mods. I had a lovely conversation with another one earlier and they were not near as aggressive as you.
GameSale,ff25vpu,t1_ff1p6cc,1579494674.0,"Mod 1: we do appreciate the feedback and suggestions so please keep them coming. Thank you. 

Mod 2: who the hell are you!?

Why you mods playing good cop/bad cop with me?"
GameSale,fezy1bn,t1_fezxgqm,1579463134.0,That’s cool and if you read one of my previous comments you’ll see I mention that I think power/trusted sellers (such as yourself) should get an exception to the rule.
GameSale,fezowlw,t1_fezlzsv,1579459824.0,"But how can we, as a mod team, enforce that rule? 

Check to see if a selling post has a timestamp. 

Inspect every public image?

No, just check that there is a timestamp pic so inspect one public image per selling post. Sellers can easily indicate which photo is the timestamp photo. 

Then, if requested, there can be additional pics of the items to show different angles/condition without timestamps. If you’re selling 50 games take one pic with a timestamp showing a stack of all the games. Add additional photos when requested. 

Require same-date images in every top post?

In every new post. So if I’m selling something then today I would timestamp it with today’s date. If it doesn’t sell and I post it again next week I’ll post it with an updated timestamp. 

Warn/ban people not including timestamps in images?

Yes, remove their post until they update it with a timestamp. 

How about reactively taking action on reported images? No don’t make the rule retroactive just say “from this date forward we will require timestamps on all new submissions.”

That leaves top posts... The issue here is that we have power users with hundreds, some even thousand+ items. 

Power users would be tricky, but since they’re usually trusted sellers maybe they could have an addendum to the rule. 

The moment we require updated time stamped images every post, we lose a massive chunk of the user base.

This is an assumption and not a fact. But you will lose a massive chunk of scammers IMO. 

Anyways good luck and keep up the good work."
GameSale,fezj5g6,t1_fez9nyl,1579457885.0,"It’s cool no need to apologize, but I don’t think I’m alone in my “interpretation.” 

I will say I think timestamps should be required and not “suggested”. It seems like the benefits of a timestamp would greatly outweigh the annoyance to mods and users."
GameSale,feyda1p,t3_eqwguv,1579444050.0,"Lol. 

User: suggestion

Our response: “no”"

pics,feggob9,t1_feggeuw,1579092154.0,"If you read his other replies I think it does. He makes wild comparisons, “oh so he can post to reddit to process his grief can he beat somebody up or run someone over with his car to process his grief?! Where’s the line?!”

I think tone and perspective are both dumb."
pics,feggkfc,t1_feggens,1579092052.0,Reddit is so much bigger than the little box you tried to put it in. And if this post offends you guess what? That’s ok too. You’re allowed to be offended and the world doesn’t have to walk on eggshells to try and not offend you.
pics,feggbv7,t1_fegg98v,1579091823.0,Well I think that’s a good outlook You seem like a reasonable person. I hope you have a good day.
pics,fegg8p5,t1_fegfyt5,1579091738.0,"Not me. Reddit posts (not this one IMO) can definitely be concerning, frustrating, confusing, etc...

But when you get to the comments and see the vicious hive mind circle jerks we do, well that is what really puts a damper on my faith in humanity. 

“Oh why would he do this?! What an asshole to try and reep karma from his dying wife”

Grief is grief he’s not hurting anyone let him mourn in his own way. Why is there a need to berate him? What is it inside us that makes us feel so much better to bring down a hurting man?"

What absolute pieces of shit we have become. Just judgmental assholes that need to circle jerk with the hive mind because we are so much better than others."
pics,fegf3pk,t1_fegetqk,1579090606.0,Me too. Reddit comments are the worst.
pics,fegexn6,t1_fegepx2,1579090427.0,All your replies are so fucking stupid  “oh he can address his pain by smashing a car or getting into a fight” both of which are completely different than posting to reddit. You don’t understand? Of course you fucking don’t you bozo.
pics,fegesk8,t1_fege6yh,1579090281.0,Ok how about more specific. Don’t judge someone who copes by sharing their pain with others. They aren’t “starting fights” what a dumb MF rebuttal.
