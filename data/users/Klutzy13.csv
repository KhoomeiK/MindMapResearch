darksouls3,ff6wp2q,t3_erukc9,1579636439.0,"This feels dirty and I threw up a little reading it.

I really like how it seems like you're build is trying to play a completely different game in order to accomplish the same goal as other invaders. If I was actually decent at the game I'd love to try it out."
MonsterHunterWorld,ff4xlir,t1_ff4qzt3,1579574877.0,"same here! Tobi is just the best. I ended up spending about 25 minutes walking around watching tobi drink water, eat some food, and lay down in his lair."
MonsterHunterWorld,ff40q9e,t1_ff3m9i8,1579553018.0,Oops! All odogaron!
monsterhunterrage,ff3of50,t3_er7xls,1579545402.0,"Good job! After dealing with him in started practicing a new tactic for each new monster: I'd go in blind, not using any healing items or buying food, and just try to dodge the monster to figure out its patterns. Then come back on a second try and give it a real go!"
MordhauFashion,fetdcvz,t1_feszhfc,1579374178.0,Its funny how no matter how much you mess up benadryl cucumberpatchs name you can always recognize him
MonsterHunterWorld,fenkqfi,t1_fen6xz1,1579286773.0,Does the type of decorations you get depend on the monster you're fighting?
MonsterHunterWorld,fenkchy,t1_feneqos,1579286543.0,"I havent given tigrex a go yet, but I personally found Nargacuga way easier then barioth. I'm not even sure why, they both seems jumpy but I guess narga clicked with me better. Hoping tigrex goes well too!"
MonsterHunterWorld,fendk7r,t1_fen6141,1579282389.0,"Yeah, so far Nargacuga's the easiest monster Ive fought since beating barioth. I dont think I carted on him at all. Right now I just got off beating Glavenus and im not sure if I should try Brachy or Tigrex next, both seem pretty scary."
antiwork,fem627s,t1_fel3cft,1579241034.0,"I believe he was being sarcastic and lashing out. but those ideas of blaming yourself for everything can happen to people. Some people live their whole lives being blamed for problems regardless of whether or not its their fault. That shit can get ingrained into your mind so much that you end up truly believing it, that its not that you made a mistake, but you are a mistake, and always have been. Its a really fucked up mentality and it can cause a lot of strain on a person, and can take a lot of work to help them out of that mindset, since most wouldn't ask for help, as they wouldn't want to bother anyone else with their own problems."
offmychest,fem3wzu,t1_fem3uob,1579238916.0,"yeah, sorry about the whining haha."
offmychest,fem3lqx,t1_felyeov,1579238627.0,"Eh. I matter to others, just not to myself. I'm not going anywhere sadly."
offmychest,fekqm8g,t3_epndfj,1579205581.0,"Life sucks, and as much as i try to tell others that they arent to blame for their own problems, I go and blame myself, because I can reason why things are my fault and besides, its wrong to blame others. I just dont want to be here anymore."
MonsterHunterWorld,fei1ubp,t1_fehyimv,1579128439.0,"Thank you for the reply! I'm definitely going to go back and try being more patient with my moves as well, I noticed during a pink rathian fight i was basically button mashing and almost died."
MonsterHunterWorld,fehrxu2,t1_fehiayd,1579122678.0,"I tend to into training a lot, haha! But I find for me I have too much trouble with positioning myself, or anticipating attacks, which I dont think the training mode can help with."
MonsterHunterWorld,fehrtbu,t1_fehcafd,1579122609.0,"Thank you for the response! I have a lot of trouble using the sliding slash to reposition myself, especially when I'm underneath a monster and cant see anything.

When you say not to rush the combos, do you mean delay each button press? And would you recommend amping the sword mode at all?"
MonsterHunterWorld,feh1ijh,t1_fegpwgo,1579107190.0,"I used charge blade for the entire base game, but I ended up switching over to the longsword as I feel its ""easier"" to use. It at least, I've been having better luck against monsters with it then the charge blade. Do you have any tips to get back into it? I found that I had lots of trouble landing saeds and not getting a chance to use the axe mode at all really."
MonsterHunterWorld,fegzcg7,t1_fegc6hh,1579105873.0,"If you dont mind me asking, how is tigrex's moves compared to barioth? I'm holding off on progressing the story to catch up on hr/mr optional quests, but I've heard a lot about tigrex as well, so I'm pretty curious."
MonsterHunterWorld,fegz2aa,t1_fegdskq,1579105699.0,"I honestly found him closer to nergigante, minus the super dive bomb and plus some breath attacks. I noticed pretty quickly that if he takes a big leap away from you, it's better to stay and prepare to dodge/ block as he will either shoot frost and leap back, or just straight up charge at you. Still was a pain getting used to it. I ended up using about 12 flash bugs, but I also missed a few. I personally enjoyed the fight, it felt like a monster that was actually trying to kill me rather then defend themselves if that makes sense!"
MonsterHunterWorld,feg4btb,t1_feg48hx,1579076311.0,"That's fair! For me Ive always struggled against more aggressive monsters. There's been a few monsters that I felt were much easier then what I was told, while at the same time struggling against ones that others seem to be easy. I suppose its the way that I play personally. Im excited to see what else is on the list though!"
MonsterHunterWorld,feg2cg8,t1_feg26c3,1579073880.0,"Thats a fair point. I think for some people some monsters can be easier or harder depending on how they play and learn. I havent fought glavenus at all yet, I think im gonna take a break and start finishing a bunch of the optional quests, and maybe get some more armor pieces."
MonsterHunterWorld,feg0t43,t1_feg0gnd,1579072086.0,"Definitely after his wings and tail break, it starts sliding about and getting really sloppy. Even so, maybe my positioning was way off, but he managed to get back up before I could land more then a few hits in. Thinking back, I probably could have finished it several minutes earlier if I brought traps along and tried to capture it, as the last bit was a struggle for me even with his exhausted state."
MonsterHunterWorld,feg0nn8,t1_feg0bl5,1579071912.0,"Ahh, I dont have any of that gear at all. I was using the Viper Kadachi armor and sword. There are a few monsters Im not excited to fight again, but Im hoping for a good rematch against this guy!"
MonsterHunterWorld,feg0k5w,t1_feg0909,1579071800.0,"Yeah! Huge damage increase from the last few monsters I was dealing with. Ive been using evade extender and window, which has been a massive help, but only getting a few pokes every so often was why it took so long. I think I only got one or two helm breakers in overall, and Im not even sure I managed to get to red on my spirit gauge. I definitely look forward to grinding him with others, and see how that plays out haha!"
MonsterHunterWorld,fefyuc1,t1_fefyeg1,1579069885.0,"It was fast and really aggressive, but I really enjoyed how it moved and attacked. Out of all of the moves, the biggest struggle I had with him was the pro football shoulder tackle, which I still havent gotten the hang of. I dont know if it was me getting better with the LS, but he is also the first time I managed to land several foresight slashes. I was pretty sloppy overall, but it felt really enjoyable. I dont think I broke his wings until about 20 minutes in, and his tail at 30. Even when he was wounded and in his lair there was still several moments where I had to take a step back and use my healing items, praying my palico could distract him enough for me to heal and get back in."
MonsterHunterWorld,fefhic5,t3_eow48a,1579056435.0,"I picked the charge blade because I thought it looked cool, and it felt like I could do a lot of different things with it. It gave me what I felt to be versatility. 

However, I've switched over to the longsword for now because with all the evasion skills I have it just feels much easier to kill the monsters in against."
MonsterHunterWorld,feeuqsv,t1_feetzvn,1579041640.0,"Haha, no worries, I'll take any advice I can get. I think I spoiled myself watching speedrun before buying the game, as that's kind of how I built my character."
MonsterHunterWorld,feetosl,t1_feet8cw,1579040987.0,"Diablos Tyrannis into Nergal Lacerator after I beat him enough times. As for armor, I dont remember the specifics but for the majority I used attack boost/artillery/capacity boost, and critical eye when I got the chance. I probably didnt build ""properly"" but it got the job done. I did use the defender armor near the end, but that was for the monsters I already fought before.

&#x200B;

Edit: I did use defender gear to beat nergigante, as well."
MonsterHunterWorld,feet5ik,t1_feerp5w,1579040662.0,"Dont really understand what you mean. Im only 80 hours in, and yeah, MR4, HR 38.  Ive hit a couple walls, mostly with diablos and nergigante, but I didnt build armor to counter any specific monster. At most Id bring along more screamer/flash pods. Like I said, im still learning. HR went by pretty fast I guess."
MonsterHunterWorld,fed4trk,t1_fed4px5,1578998906.0,Thank you for the information! I've never heard of anything like that before.
MonsterHunterWorld,fed2z4b,t1_feczroc,1578996183.0,"How much is it worth it to upgrade armor? At the point where I'm at armor starts at around 100 +, and each level only adds 2. How much of an impact does +6 on 118 even do?"
MonsterHunterWorld,fed2szn,t1_fed2485,1578995930.0,"I thought the shield was guard 5 with the guard point.
1 for the shield, +2 for charging the shield, and another +2 for hitting the guard point. Or did something change?"
MonsterHunterWorld,fect8ue,t1_fecr8q8,1578983717.0,"I had a lot of fun with that particular monster. Hes really fast and aggressive, and bounces around a lot. When you do decide to fight him make sure to bring some jerky along."
MonsterHunterWorld,fecrrsa,t1_fecoxmw,1578982149.0,"Yeah, I figured that would make it so much easier. I'm still learning a bunch of things and dont really know how to build for monsters yet, just wearing what I think looks cool haha."
MonsterHunterWorld,febmsgo,t1_febj8gy,1578960520.0,How do you go about using the switch axe? It looks pretty fun but messing around in the training I cant seem to do much with it
MonsterHunterWorld,febma2x,t3_eocrtb,1578960319.0,"I've just got to hunting this beast in the game. I'd say that in my opinion the poison is much worse and harder to deal with compared to its paralysis.  It loves its aerial attacks, and it can cover a good range with its tail attacks. It can also shoot out spines that poison you as well.  That being said, maybe it was just me but each time I fought it I got many, many opportunities to latch on with the claw and make weak spots. I dunno if that was just luck or if its weak to those."
MonsterHunterWorld,fe9w2zy,t1_fe9t9ia,1578941942.0,"Thanks for the quick reply! I still have trouble using most consumables except for the healing ones, which I imagine is making things harder then they need to be!"
MonsterHunterWorld,fe9srji,t1_fe9jfbf,1578941159.0,"If you dont mind me asking, just how much of an impact does demon and armor consumables actually give? I rarely use them because I'm always concerned the ""next fight"" will be tougher and I'll need them, or I'm worried about carting and wasting resources."
MonsterHunterWorld,fe5wv5z,t1_fe0upn2,1578876740.0,"I ended up using the defender gear and cb to beat him, still took several hours though."
MonsterHunterWorld,fe5wqiz,t1_fe1l8y1,1578876658.0,"I honestly just have lots of trouble with really aggressive monsters. My first big struggle was diablos, and this was the second wall I was stuck against. I dont seem to be any good at using the guard points, and with nergigante I was getting two shotted with my build at the time. Also, I'm guessing it was just me, but it felt sometimes like I was getting hit while being clear of the monster, like outside of its hitbox."
MonsterHunterWorld,fe5wipi,t1_fe0ruh2,1578876520.0,"I've never used the lance before, do you have some tips for someone just jumping into it?"
MonsterHunterWorld,fe0nmet,t1_fe0minf,1578816447.0,"I've been using them for grinding, but I've been trying to not use them for each new monster so I can try and get the hang of the monster itself, rather then try and brute force my way with the constant blasts going on."
bloodbowl,fd85gpr,t3_ek364s,1578214088.0,"Looks like gorrok got bored of not dying on the battlefield and wanted to test his might again nuffle.

I love the white scales!"
furry_irl,fbfks1g,t1_fbedjz8,1576813002.0,"haha. I didnt witness anything except for a nsfw cuddle room, walked in, saw flesh, walked out.

saw a couple naked people on the beds in my room but never watched anyone else get it on."
