You just lower the diaper and pull it out between their legs while keeping it right side up. There were some gnarly poops and diarrhea once, but I never had any issue with it at all."
Parenting,feu1t3g,t3_eqlzvw,1579382261.0,"I became a foster parent to toddlers with zero experience with kids. I had to google “how to change a toddler’s diaper?” The first YouTube video was a chipper British lady demonstrating a standing change. I was like, got it. No need to watch another video.

Many months later, my friend babysat my foster daughter and later told me in a concerned tone that she wouldn’t lay down for her diaper change. I was like, “Duh. She’s not a *baby.”* That’s when I learned laying diaper changes were the norm for all ages of diaper-wearers.

I still stuck with standing diaper changes. SO MUCH EASIER."
dogs,fete5hq,t3_eqkfif,1579374462.0,"I tried replacing my late, great dogs “only” toy with a new exact one and he was like “bitch, no. That’s not mine and we both know that’s not the same.

dogs,felt11p,t1_felqvsu,1579230211.0,"Yeah the issue is shitty people who get a tiny dog cuz they think it’s a toy or fashion accessory. But tiny dogs are dogs who just happen to be small enough to pop into a tote bag when you have to run into a store.

About half my chis haven’t needed any training not to yap at visitors. The others were so obsessed with me as their current “person” that they were easily redirected to get scratches from me vs yelling at a stranger.

And for what it’s worth: I get the chi-prejudice. When I was looking to adopt a dog, I was considering “any small dog... except a chihuahua.” Then I met my late, great first dog and fell in love with the breed. They’re awesome, affectionate buddies who are obsessed with their people when they’re around, but confident enough to be left alone... and can hike up snowy mountains like mofos."

dogs,felk5wy,t1_fel8uo3,1579224125.0,"Yeah I’ve heard that a lot, but it hasn’t been my experience (again, with 2 dozen resident or foster chis under my belt). 

I’ve NEVER had one that constantly yapped (though I’ve had a couple foster terriers that did...). My forever-chi and current foster don’t even alert-bark at the doorbell or when strangers (to them) come into the apartment. They just wiggle and jockey for pets.

And yeah, chis can take a bit longer to train, but they WANT to please and will eventually get it. And my current chi(weenie) is a goddamn circus dog who can do a ton of tricks and loves learning them."

dogs,fel17t6,t3_epowcu,1579211858.0,"I think chihuahuas are just about the perfect cuddly companion. And I don’t understand their reputation for being nasty to strangers. I’ve owned or fostered about 2 dozen. A few were shy and standoffish with new people, but the vast majority loved making new friends on our walks.

And they’re really easy to adopt, especially in the south. You can definitely find a foster-based rescue so your parents have a good idea of the dog’s personality before they commit."
sewing,feddfin,t3_eol4hs,1579008395.0,"If you can get your kids excited about a project, their enthusiasm may rub off on you.

As a kid, my mom would park me at the pattern catalog table at Joann’s while she shopped. I’d pick out a pattern or two from the on-sale brand, then we’d pick out fabric for what I wanted. Later I’d “help” her sew it (mostly taking pins out and snipping threads and getting in the way until I got older and could be directed to legit help)."

Then I realized... I hadn’t done anything less than I would have if I’d known it was near the end. I mean, I would’ve gotten a DNA test cuz I’m still curious, but nothing that would affect him.

I still miss the hell out of him, but there’s some solid peace knowing I did right by him."
nyc,fe0axw4,t3_enjfah,1578808188.0,"NY Cares has the broadest range of projects. I’ve always had good experiences with them.

NYCACC (Manhattan at least) is super-positive. You’re generally free to give as many dogs as you can the recommended 15-minute walk, or spend 2 hours with the same pup.

I volunteered for years with a Housing Works thrift shop that was awesome & fun until there was a change in management and it changed from feeling like I was a team member to feeling like I was just a retail employee who wasn’t getting paid, so I stopped. So I suspect your experience would be very location-specific."

LifeProTips,fdlqu2k,t1_fdlormc,1578530307.0,"It doesn’t happen frequently by any means, but it does happen, and when it does happen, it happens far more frequently with men of color. But when it does happen, it’s absolutely brutal on the parent and child.

No one ever batted an eye when my former foster daughter would throw a tantrum and scream that I wasn’t her mom and she didn’t want to leave with me, but I’m a decently attractive white lady, which unfortunately counts for a lot in the US. I had a scanned statement that I was her foster mom in my phone, but if I was a man, I’m pretty sure I’d have the original folded up in my wallet just in case."
dogs,fdllbe8,t3_em0d9j,1578526600.0,"I have a weird psychic rapport with traumatized dogs (and my resident pup is a champion foster brother), and almost all of my 3 dozen fosters have made themselves completely at home within 24 hours. A couple have taken up to about a week. 

But again, weird psychic connection with rescue dogs. I was allowed to adopt my late, great first dog from a notoriously strict shelter despite being an unemployed 21-year-old idiot because he immediately hopped into my lap and fell asleep after 5 months of not letting anyone near him without growling & barking like a maniac.

It’s not a lucrative super-power, but I’ll take it.

Edit: Thanks for the gold, yo! My super-power is slowly starting to pay off..."
LifeProTips,fdlbzb3,t1_fdjydd1,1578520774.0,"Yeah in retrospect that wasn’t clear at all. It’s nothing intrinsically different between men and women. 

I’ve just heard men say that they’re sometimes treated with suspicion when in public with a child, particularly when the child doesn’t look clearly related, like a step, adopted, or foster child, or just a quirk of genetics. Knowing that some people are already suspicious of men with children—as wrong as that is—and that sometimes these people call the police just because—as insane as that is—makes me imagine that a child chatting away about genitals in public could attract scrutiny towards a man that a woman wouldn’t have to worry about."
LifeProTips,fdivsku,t3_elme9h,1578452159.0,"This is what they teach in foster parent training for exactly this reason.

It’s initially awkward as hell having a toddler ask if you have a vagina (and you feel really weird answering “yes” and realizing you’re technically talking about your genitals with a toddler; and I imagine even more for men), and if the dog has a penis, and if that’s a girl dog, does she have a vagina (always asked really loud and in public)? But it’s for the greater good."
dogs,fdfgs22,t1_fdf5xnd,1578361336.0,"My foster dog was just diagnosed with a bladder stone today (via X-ray). The vet was visibly disappointed when the urinalysis results came back calcium oxalate vs struvite, meaning he would need surgery instead of dissolving it via diet.

Vet bills SUCK. They’re so expensive, and it’s hard to understand why a lot of the time. But the vast majority of vets are in it because they care about animals and aren’t rolling in dough after expenses.

Ask your vet about this product, but I’d he/she would have mentioned if the stone could be dissolved. 

As to how threatening it is: my first dog was diagnosed with bladder stones when one straight-up lodged in & blocked his urethra, requiring emergency surgery so his bladder wouldn’t explode. I was just starting out in life and emptied my bank account to fix it.

The good news is, after surgery, the RX food to prevent it from ever happening again isn’t horribly expensive."
dogs,fczfxad,t3_ejouhp,1578100374.0,"> I want an eager to please AND independent young women... But more eager to please.

I’m the biggest chihuahua fan, but this was what tipped me over the edge. Chis are obsessed with their people are want to be up their ass 24/7 and will try nonstop to please them... but once their people are gone, they have this bananas sense of self-confidence where they’re like “Go earn some cash; I’ll hold the house down til you get back.”

And though chis have a reputation as yappy monsters, I’ve owned or fostered more than two dozen, and NONE were constant yappers (terriers, different story...) and only about half alert barked. My current chi & his foster chi brother don’t even bark at the doorbell with zero training from me."
