Easier to light everything bright as fuck, shoot normally in high def, and put an Instagram filter on everything. You lose a lot of natural detail and realism when you do that.

Imagine lighting a fruit bowl with specific colored spotlights to take a picture. It will produce different colored shadows from each light and be complex and beautiful. Now imagine lighting it with a regular white bulb, then going into Photoshop and changing the saturation and hue until it just looks weird and colorful. They are not the same effect."
