Also the story itself and worldbuilding is there all throughout, and starting from season 2 and beyond, the framerate issue is completely solved. The musical score is also fantastic, in my opinion (if you like that kind of stuff)"

confession,ff4isvs,t1_ff4f1hu,1579564628.0,">he might come to terms with why u did it

But OP literally didn't have a reason, she did it just to manipulate him and get what she wants. Only in hindsight did she realize how terrible and idiotic her behavior was. OP's intention should *not* be to get her uncle to forgive her, but rather to *show remorse* and communicate to her uncle in clear and precise terms that she understands the depravity of her actions and that *it will never happen again*. If he ever EVER ends up forgiving her, that is just a bonus for her; it should not be the main objective."
