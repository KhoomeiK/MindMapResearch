AskWomen,fenboi5,t1_femuskc,1579281243.0,Yes--always keep them separate! The best way to store them is in the velvet or satin boxes they come in and not in a dry place. Pearls can actually start drying out if left in excessively dry places.
AskWomen,femt7e1,t3_epzyw2,1579268919.0,"Wedding band (never take that off), engagement ring, and diamond flower ring, are my go to every day rings. I keep those and real earrings (the ones with diamonds or gold) in a small ring box in my dresser. My costume earrings and pearls are kept on top of my dresser in an earring organizer that can fold up. My pearl studs are there because they shouldn't be in a box with other jewelry or they'd get scratched. I have some big necklaces that I have hanging from a cute branchy thing we stuck on the wall, but I honestly never wear any of them. I mostly wear a diamond solitaire necklace or switch it up with some small gold pendants I keep in the ring box. I have a larger box hidden away somewhere with my real, real jewelry and each piece is kept in the original boxes they came in. I only take those out for special occasions."
politics,fekczqk,t1_fekbfc8,1579197466.0,"Ignoring the Ukranians for a minute, I pay my taxes and trust that the government allocated funds from my taxes to things that keep me safe and keep this country running. If one person in government decides that my tax money belongs to him and he can use it or hold onto it for whatever he likes without oversight from others in government then I'd feel personally offended. That's just what Trump did. He used my money that was supposed to go to help maintain world stability and he used it to benefit himself. So yeah, we're all affected."

I know people always talk about Chryslers not being made well and needing more work than other cars and I haven't experienced that with mine. I'm wondering if they just make more lemons than other brands or if the car parts deteriorate at a faster rate and I haven't seen that yet because mine is only 3 years old. Thanks! Also, not a car expert or anything."

Anyway, she told me my future and I laughed because it was very far from what I planned on my future being. Fast forward 18 years and I'm legit living what she predicted.

All time recommendations--as others have mentioned, the Met, but also check out the Frick. It's an amazing museum housed in what used to be a private residence. It's on museum row, so you can do it in the same day as the Met. 

If you're here when it's not freezing, take a walk in Central Park or do an activity there. Not sure what activities there are as I've only ever walked through or chilled, but I know there are things you can do!

There are some neighborhoods that are nice to just walk around in--Union Square, Soho, etc. 

Other recommendations depend on season and where you're coming from."

This is probably more about your brother feeling left out than anything else. I ended up with most of my great-grandmother's jewelry and I cannot tell you how many comments and stinkeyes I have to put up with from cousins. It's absurd.

Her parents and in-laws hosted (paid for) the wedding and there were like 700 people."
AmItheAsshole,fcv9337,t3_ej2idh,1577997195.0,"YTA I am completely biased as I went to a small all-girls high school and the third or fourth girl to get married invited the whole class except me. My friends all called me after the shower to ask where I was and why I hadn't been there. Then I had to explain that I wasn't invited. One friend took it upon herself to find out if my invitation had gotten lost in the mail. It was very bizarre that I was singled out (I didn't have enough to personally do with the bride to have insulted her at any point) and I can't tell you how hurt I felt that not having me at her wedding was so important to this girl that she singled me out of the whole class. In the end, I was at the grocery store and ran into her mom who suddenly started gushing at me that she ""doesn't know WHY I didn't get my INVITATION and OF COURSE I'm invited! And I ABSOLUTELY MUST come!!"" Then the bride's best friend called me to let me know I'm invited but it's so close to the wedding that they didn't want to wait for a response card, and can I RSVP quickly? I did not want to attend but at that point I felt I had no choice because if I didn't go my friends would be talking about it all wedding and that would be rude to the bride. So in conclusion, YWBTA for singling out one girl and I hope you mature as you grow up."

2 and up: ask pointed questions like, ""do you like Elmo?"" When trying to stop a dangerous behavior, use specific language like, ""hands up"" instead of, ""we don't hit babies.""

Other than that, kids are people. They all have different attitudes and personalities, but most of them are super fun conversationalists. 

Topics they may enjoy talking about: shows they like (Paw Patrol, Rescue Riders, Pokemon, Wild Kratts), favorite animals, dinosaurs, favorite princesses, favorite foods, best friends, etc.

ETA: don't talk about yourself much. Kids don't really care that you liked dinosaurs or whatever when you were their age."
