My wife ordered me one, wrapped it, and I got it on Christmas. Today we were talking and I was telling her I mainly kept digital games on my switch, don't really buy a lot of physical so I don't have to keep the cartridges from my toddler son. She looked at me like a fool and asked how I had digital games on a lite. I explained that I could just download them from the shop and my BiG sD cArD cOuLd HoLd LoTs Of GaMeS. She looked at me like a fool again and it just wasn't clicking. After talking for a few more mins I finally got to the issue.

My wife, one of the slowest people I've ever met, thought that she had spent $200 on my Christmas gift, which she thought was a LIGHT for my OG Nintendo switch. She didn't realize she had bought me a full fledge game console, she thought it was a light so I could play in the dark. But since I asked for it she didn't block blink at a $200 price tag for what she thought was essentially a light bulb.

I loathe that woman. Lol"
