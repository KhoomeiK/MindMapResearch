Jamie getting away from Cersei's control and influence like he did, getting close to Brienne and actually being treated as an individual person, not a copy of someone else, Jamie could have made the difficult decision to kill his sister. 

It would have been the bittersweet ending we needed for Cersei. She became a character we loved to hate but also understood."

Small doses are fine with me, prolonged periods of time end up in a right over politics or religion. If I do or say something, then she bitches at my brother about it. Like when the family came over to my house for Christmas. I was playing Norse Viking music (think Wardruna) because I can't stand Christmas songs, and really, it's my house, I'll pay whatever music I feel like. She later told my brother that I ruined Christmas for her."

ABoringDystopia,fezli36,t1_fezifnx,1579458610.0,"I had taken the load the morning before the storm really hit. I knew what I was driving into, my boss knew it too. I had two options, 1) take the load, get stuck in the storm, and get paid once I can complete the delivery or 2) refuse the load and not get paid at all until the roads opened up and I could take a load then.

The other factor in taking this particular load was that the first stop was in North Dakota, the rest of the material was going into Canada. At the time, there were only two other drivers on the crew that had passports but they were on home time. I was literally the only driver that could take that load.

As for sueing, wouldn't have held up in court, being that I chose to take the load. The company enforces the ""you're the captain of that ship, you make the call on whether it's safe to drive or not"" belief. They would say they sent out messages to drivers telling us to be careful yada yada but I drove anyway.

To clarify, when I started driving the weather wasn't bad. It was only the last hour or so of driving that visibility got bad and I wasn't able to see the roads too well anymore. I was on a two lane road with no shoulder, I slowed way down with my flashers on and just drove until I found somewhere safe to park the truck. Ended up at gas station (not a truck stop)."

I was the loner and always wore a trench coat (in hindsight, not a good idea as this was a few years after Columbine and in Colorado).

atheism,feni4gs,t1_fen8jwj,1579285184.0,"I assure with you on the trucking. I'm a truck driver myself. One part of me is amazed by the advancements in technology to create a self-driving truck, the other part knows that it'll still take time for all drivers to be replaced. The technology is great but still needs practice hauling different kinds of trailers and loads, as well as different types of weather.

As a truck driver, it's my duty to assess the road conditions of weather I feel it's safe to drive. Most all weather I feel comfortable driving in but do I want to put others at risk?? Absolutely not. I'd rather be late than have blood on my hands.

I think the biggest resistance from drivers about self-driving trucks is capitalism. If I get replaced by an automated truck tomorrow, I then have to find another job. I wouldn't get severance pay for being laid off and I doubt I'd get much from unemployment. If all trucks are automated, I wouldn't even be able to find another trucking company to work for. Unfortunately, I don't have a degree in anything, so I'd have to take a massive cut in pay for any work to try and make ends meet with 50-60% less pay every month.

It's scary to some drivers that have been driving for 30+ years. It's all they know and they can't afford to learn to do something else."
