Otherwise, she will probably be impress.

She would be glad that I went through my teenage anger crisis. I found them horrible already when I was 13. But happy that I'm still able to scared people when I got really angry. That's very useful sometimes.

She will be sad and chocked to learn that my indestructible passed away last year."

It's probably because as a kid, I grew up using girl/dude all the time.

I still try to go for women/men now as I'm 27 and definitely not a little girl anymore (and my friend not little boys)"

aww,fdhdbtm,t1_fdfxwdh,1578420331.0,"My almost golden (mixed with flat coated) lived outside and prefer being outside.
Obviously, on extreme weather (heat, snow, etc) he goes inside or in the basement.

Otherwise, we sometimes invite him in as long as the house is not just cleaned but if we leave the door open, he will be out in less than 10 minutes. 
He knows he need to stay ""calm"" inside, while he can run outside. So he prefers calling us from outside to play than to go in.


Also, we have a very big garden where he can run and play.



I think it mostly depend on the breed and the dog itself. I would not recommend it and smaller dogs or with a small garden. I would also personally allow the dog in anytime, but that's because I will want to cuddle them all the time...

On the other hand, I have trouble understanding the small cage I sometimes see or heard about for us house. This is not a thing where I came from. I guess there is a cultural part here too."
