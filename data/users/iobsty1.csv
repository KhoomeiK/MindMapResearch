I know for me my family has a history of chemical depression onset around nineteen so you should find out what's common in your family to see if you might be following the trend. Also strive to find the help you need. If a therapist doesn't cut it, work really hard to put intentionality in doing the things that make you happy. (I clean my room which makes me happy and try to stay out of it cause being alone in my room makes me sad)"
college,fdoabhx,t3_embdf6,1578601607.0,Does it violate a suite agreement? I know I have a roommate agreement that talks about respecting one another's space and things. If it breaks it your ra might actually be able to step in.

HollowKnight,fbwhvrk,t3_eeltku,1577150353.0,I don't really play the game I just love the art and I absolutely adore the work you've done so much. It's so cool and the color coordination you've used to describe it to us was very well done. Fascinating stuff keep it up!!
