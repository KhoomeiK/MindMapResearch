I found clearing a chunk of my debt --even if it meant I paid more taxes that year-- freed me of a heavy psychological burden (debt worry).

vancouver,feeau5d,t1_fee7203,1579029955.0,"A few tips:  

Make sure you fill up before you cross the border. 

The closer you get to your destination, the slower you'll need to drive. Many homeless people there have addiction problems and the city's designated pretty most of area you'll be staying in a 30 km/h (18 m/h) zone to try and protect everyone.  

When out and about, you WILL be spotted by panhandlers. If asked for money, a simple ""Sorry I don't carry cash."" is all you need to say and it's safe to look them in the eye when you say it. The city has multiple shelters as well as emergency heat shelters for homeless to get somewhere safe to sleep, stow their personal belongings, bring in their pet(s), and get free meals and hot drinks.  

Having said that: if you're nearing someone in mental distress (you'll know it if you see it), just keep your eyes averted and blend into the background for them. You will actually be quite safe even if you run into this because the homeless people are generally scared of us ""straight"" people."

I'm 50. Life can be scary. My ex died three years ago, of an embolism three weeks after he survived a quadruple bypass. Our daughters suffered greatly, the strain of mothering them through their grief shattered my nerves. I now suffer from recurring bouts of severe anxiety. I've felt that literal fear of slipping and falling and breaking bones. I've felt that terror, that dread, that *an unknowable something* terrible will happen to your loved one if they step out the front door to live their best life. I've had my sleep ruined by anxieties or terrors that show up at 2 am. And I've berated myself because I viewed my problems as weaknesses.  

Talk to your wife. She already knows something's wrong, she's worried and she's waiting and hoping you let her in on your secret. Telling her about your fears will let you get them out of the shadows of your mind, into the open, where they're exposed and you can spot them. Because it's time to start fighting them. These fears are bullies preying upon you in your most vulnerable moments. If these bullies were preying on your wife, you'd do everything in your power to fight them. Well... you deserve the same care. 

Talk to a counsellor. I did and it works. I learned about how I'm not alone in my fears. I learned that there's been a tremendous amount of peer reviewed (tested to work) research into cognitive behaviour therapies that are basically self-help tools to mitigate or even beat our problems. I learned how to take care of myself. I learned how to forgive myself. I learned how to trust myself. I learned how much better I could feel if I took care of myself.   

Take care of yourself.
