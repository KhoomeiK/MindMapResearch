Now, the only criticism I have, and it’s very minor, is there are a few errors in the description but as far as the creature goes, I love the idea of a river kraken. I might actually use it in my campaign along with some kraken-worshipping kuo-toa or freshwater sahuagin. I’ve been planning a section of my campaign that’s basically the river from Apocalypse Now and this is almost like it was made for it.  
  
The errors are the second paragraph it has “to do so” twice in the same sentence and the third paragraph it says “create create” in the last sentence."

UnearthedArcana,ff86kgs,t1_ff704ci,1579667419.0,"Huge creatures are 16-30 feet in length roughly. So as far as river-dwelling predators go, it's pretty damn massive, but there would be food for it in places like the Mekong, Nile, Amazon, and maybe even the Mississippi rivers. Like, Nile crocodiles are 12-15 feet. But, if the rivers it inhabits in OP's world are like the Mekong, there are some catfish there that can be damn near 700 lbs.  

  

The only thing I would be worried about is river depth. Like the absolute deepest part of the Mississippi is 200 feet and the deepest part of the Mekong is 262 feet, but a 30 foot long squid lizard monster would have a rough time outside of those areas. Like the deepest part of the whole Rio Grande is 60 feet."

I would probably actually build it from the left side of the window all the way to the wall on the right side. You wouldn't lose much floor space and the lamp could even be incorporated."

The bases were a lot of fun to make, as well; probably didn't have to do as many steps as I did, but it was a learning process. Armageddon Dust first, then Martian Ironearth, then Vallejo Game Ink brown (to fill in all the cracks where the Armageddon Dust shows through), then a 50/50 mixture of PVA glue and water, finally a heavy dusting of Vallejo Earth & Oxide Pigment powder in Red Ochre to make it look like a dusty red desert."
