I must question this logic of accusing those hurt by the church of somehow not having relevant opinions on account of that. Should the word of the rape victim be judged irrelevant on account of him being raped and therefore having a less than positive opinion of the character of his rapist? It is so much easier to blame victims than ask why so many people seem to be hurt or abused by the church in the first place.

A nation's creation myth is telling its story and passing on values of importance: for Mayans, the centrality of corn to their civilization; for Israelites, the idea of obeying God (and more practically, the priesthood who derives their power from that obedience) rather than from the tree of knowledge i.e. succumbing to the more sophisticated Babylonians who conquered them."

It also explains the division of labor, menstruation, and justifies the oppression of women as punishment.

The trouble for Christians is Paul the apostle seemed to think there was a literal Adam and his reasoning about salvation to a degree depends on this point.
