IAmA,fenchls,t1_fem8ale,1579281740.0,"Me saying ""There have been cases of false reports"" doesn't equate to ""MANY CASES, ALL CASES, 100% CASES, TOO MANY CASES""  


There just has BEEN cases.  


To sit here and then say ""If they didn't consent then they're guilty, full stop"" will open up a huge can that no one wants. We just need to make sure that we keep/improve our system of justice on this.  


I don't know why the two of you think I'm trying to say that there's bajillions of false reports. You're all trying to light a fire on a sentence that was merely a statement of no true importance on the real point."

Point I said was: Just because they SAY ""I did not consent"" doesn't mean the suspect is AUTOMATICALLY guilty."
IAmA,fekz7kc,t1_fekyjku,1579210665.0,"Whaaaat.

Is using the scientific method not science based?

Hypothesis: He was raped.
Find facts: Listen to stories.
Match facts.
Conclusion."
IAmA,fekyfbx,t1_fektvvt,1579210192.0,"No.

I'm saying to USE science based approach.

Not assuming someone is guilty just because someone said ""I didn't consent."""
IAmA,fektjye,t1_fekte1g,1579207306.0,"So we should just say they're guilty and stop investigation? Innocent before guilty you know.

I didn't say they were common or even frequent. Just saying we shouldn't assume. Hearing stories are better than not."
IAmA,fekspew,t1_fekq8ml,1579206804.0,"Well you can't just hear ""I didn't consent"" and slap a case on the other person. You have to hear it out.

There was a case where a woman beat the shit out of a dude and she turned around to cops and said she was raped. They asked both stories and boom. She got in trouble.

Either gender need to speak their story. It may be chilling to relive it but the fact that you can attest and make sure you're not lying is the painful but important part.

Not saying all victims are liars. Just that there has been cases of false report.

Saying ""If they said they didn't consent then the other is guilty, full stop"" is a very toxic ideology.

Anyone can say they didn't consent. I could say I didn't consent to sex last night despite I did. Does that mean he's guilty?"

Edit Hail to hair. My bad.

FYI- I'm female.

Never had feminine issues using it. This does not mean another female won't. Try small areas first.

Massages: my skin is fairly dry naturally. (Hot showers makes this worse) so I tend to actually benefit. Some may experience acne. Be careful.

Sex: Not sure of the chemistry of latex/oil etc. Please research before hand. I use birth control that has been successful so the condom vs oil is not my forte.

Hair: LESS IS MORE. Just like hair gel, barely get any and rub your hands together so it seems like there is none. Then scrunch uour hair around. Use more/less from there. 

Other than that; I'm not very girly? So I really have no say so in this matter. This is just from my experience and to be taken with a grain of salt...

... Or a drop of oil

summonerschool,fdeugk5,t3_ekyw39,1578346845.0,"There's so many X factors in laning and buys for me.  


Does opposing lane have poke? Might try for Vampiric Scepter first. This is if you haven't already chosen the Bloodline Rune. I HIIIIIIGHLY recommend this rune because natural %12 life steal over time is fantastic and gets you out of mid game ganks. Especially if you're playing a champion that needs Crit>I.E. such as Jhin, Trist, Cait and Jinx.  


Other than that, as long as you have chunky champs: BF Sword > Boots > Berserkers > I.E. After this, it depends.  


Jhin and Trist are great with Stattik Shiv first Attack Speed item. Cait and Jinx work well with Runaans for the wave clear/life steal. Especially since they both really do well with Bloodthirster. So it helps you life steal from CS during fights since Runaans also applies on hit effects.  


After that is debatable. Depending on team comp. Are they tanky? Bork/Lord/Mortals. Are they squishy? Essence. Are they squishy but one shot you? Rapid fire. Etc. Honestly at that point it's based on what you're dealing with. Especially if your own team is throwing/feeding/etc. You might even have to go third item Guardian Angel. You'll get more feel on what's going on.  


This is coming from hard stuck Silver that mains Support/ADC. Tristana is my pocketpick win and every game ever I always go BF>Berserkers>I.E.>Stattik and never fails."
