Have a side button that when pushed enables the ""release to shoot mode""

When the mode is off the shoot button acts normally.

When the mode is engaged and the shoot button is up, it stays up.

When you first press shoot the mouse keeps the button up, so no signal sent to game.

When you release the button the mouse send mouse down.

When you press again it sends mouse up.

When you disengage the mode it will revert back to normal. However if the button was down when you release then the mouse will still be in the up position and when you release the first time nothing is sent effectively allowing you to switch modes easily without extra input being generated.

The would be undetectable and offers no real advantage.

It's not about disappointment, he is married. You could be the best in bed, but he is married and a coworker. If all your after is sex, then just keep it cool and continue to be you. Don't overtly flirt with other people around, and keep it professional unless your alone with no coworkers in sight. Don't act desperate because that will scare him off and make you look immature and unsuitable as a mistress.

Definitely don't act like he is rejecting you. He is married and your not going to be anything more than a booty call unless he gets a divorce. Does he have kids? That will also be a factor. Remember he is married and this probably was something be realized was not a good idea because he loves his wife.

If your looking for a real relationship, then look elsewhere. Even if he gets a divorce (which is unlikely especially if he has kids) he will likely cheat on you in the future with someone else.

Some surfaces don't work well for capturing clean prints.  Prints don't have any sort of timestamp as it's just oil on a surface so you can only say someone was there, but not when.  This means you can't use prints to follow how a person is moving, only if a person has been in the area or more accurately that they touched something that is now currently in the area.

However usually workplace romances result in tension when the break up occurs. This can be minor of you don't work regularly together and the breakup was mutual (you stay friends to some extent).

Extreme cases result in one of the people looking for a new job.

Other this you need to certain you can handle are needing to working with her if she rejects you and keeping it professional. Concerns about sexual harassment if you come on too strong or are too persistent.

The thing is the play style is very different and requires knowing when to back out to get heals instead of just dieing. You have to be aggressive in the backline to make sure the enemy is splitting focus. Your team needs to be mobile, and this is the opposite of a orisa comp where the benefit is stay behind the static shield.

Granted Mei can shut him down hard and pretty much forces you off ball unless you can manage her with the dps.

Sigma is such a magneto style hero. Dva is similar with matrix.  The thing is anything that is a shield (absorb damage) is still a shield being held in front. We have to have more outside the box playing which is difficult because it will result in lots of losses until you find something that works. It will likely also require coordination that pickup groups won't have and will bitch that your throwing because they want a shield.  Balance is difficult because you need a way to have only limited effectiveness of absorbing damage whether it's shield health (limiting absolute damage) or time (limiting how long you can absorb unlimited damage). You can also tweak how often you can repair the shield be gaining health or cool downs if it's a one use."

Need to be cautious because multiple girls might like you and you don't want to make any of them disappointed in case you made the wrong choice. Let's be real, we can't make the wrong choice if we don't make any choice!

They might have a boyfriend, and even worse you can't even ask because they might not tell you the truth! So it's best to avoid the topic all together and stay ambiguous in all interactions. This means no flirting, unless your already dating. Though it might be safer to wait until marriage just to be sure she is interested.

Love at first sight is a thing! It's in all the romantic movies! Heck you see how all the girls are in love with the bachelor before even meeting him! The same thing happens on the bachelorette! So if course I could be in love with someone with minimal interaction. They are also probably in love with me, but maybe not so we need to not push too hard and play the long game. Don't want to scare her off!

If I feel uncomfortable then it's clear whatever I am about to do or are doing is a really bad idea.  Better do some more research to see what bad things could happen and how to avoid them. The more you know the better.

> Why “vegan” though? Where did that short word that connotes radical vegetarians come from? Donald Watson, founder of the Vegan Society, coined the word “vegan” in 1944 as a statement against vegetarians who ate dairy products. He took the first and last letters of the word vegetarian to create his orthodox version of vegetarianism. Today, as many as 10% of American adults say they follow a vegetarian-inclined diet, but only 1% of them are strict vegans.

Should we adopt this, our diet will soon become known as a VEGAN diet, and we should aspire to the rank of VEGANS. [""The Vegan News,"" No. 1, November 1944]

Also don't forget those on the line where depending who they get matched with might change how the heros work. Imagine playing back to back games where reaper gets nerfed or buffed because you get grouped with lower or higher tier players.  The reality is you have to have a line somewhere, and even if you restrict players from grouping (which would have so much backlash), you can still have players that win with the worse reaper, but lose when he is better.
