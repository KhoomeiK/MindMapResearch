You really would never know if youre at risk. She's been feeling like shit her whole pregnancy and honestly her symptoms are really spot on for GD. Headaches, fatigue, lightheadedness. I think the treatment is actually going to make her feel better even though she is angry about it. I'm pretty sure that is the point of all of it - there is an issue that can lead to poor health outcomes for you AND baby so do this annoying thing in the meantime so there's no issue. I do hope you reconsider the test and listen to what they recommend. Of course I hope you pass!"
hearing,ffhs6o3,t1_ffgs5f2,1579951140.0,I'm glad to hear the thresholds are restoring. I'm not sure steroids will do much more at this point. Perhaps the diplacusis will resolve or you will eventually just become accustomed to it and it won't bother you so much. Our brains adapt quite well. It would seem you had a very lucky case!
pregnant,ffh1gqz,t1_ffgu7fp,1579920564.0,"My acquaintance did too. They made her do it again with an 8hr fast and she said it made her sooo sick. And she failed again. So now she tests her blood 4x a day. The crazy think is she's a bean pole. She's the essence of skinny fat. Absolutely no muscle, never works out, eats whatever she wants and doesn't gain weight. And here she is with GD."

lupus,ffeu8yb,t1_ffduugy,1579865780.0,"Yes. Looking back at symptoms, I did not have the aches, diffuse stiffness and fatigue until my lupus flare started about one month after starting Nuva ring, but on and off for about 2 years, I did have several acute joint pains, night sweats, my heart would flutter, and I ended up with some strange dental issues about 3 months prior as well that my dentist believes is part of the lupus. I also had low platelets about 6 years prior when I donated bone marrow but no one ever told me that was abnormal. The birth control I was on before did not have estrogen. I have antiphospholipid antibodies which lowers my platelet and wbc counts. It also makes my RBCs abnormally formed during a flare which can cause blood clots. I 100% can't be on a birth control with estrogen because of blood clots."
lupus,ffdtjlr,t3_et2dn7,1579828567.0,I definitely blame my contraception for  my diagnosing flare but there were autoimmune symptoms prior as well. I was on Nuva Ring for two month. I switched off of nexplanon (arm implant) after 6 years on it because we wanted to start trying for a baby. Nuva Ring has estrogen. I'll be using condoms until we're done with having kids and then I'm going back to the arm implant or asking my husband to get snipped.

workingmoms,ff9aa5s,t1_ff8xq62,1579708416.0,"This. I guess I won't know how I feel guilt-wise until I'm going through it, but my husband and I have comparable incomes and neither can be a stay at home parent. I'm not guilty over it. We found a great daycare that's convenient to us, we look forward to coming home and being excited to see and spend all of our time with the baby. I get to maintain my career and do what I'm passionate about and then I get to go home and be a great mom because I want to be. I don't think there is a wrong answer to the equation and I also don't want to feel pressured that I should feel ""guilty"". I would still want to work even if my husband made enough money for me to stay home."
pregnant,ff98wpb,t3_escm97,1579707553.0,"I'm actually getting really excited for mine because when I sat down and made my list of things that would make life easier when baby comes, it was daunting. I edited it like five times. Then when I saw things start to get snapped up it was really reassuring. My shower is in 2 weeks and the registry is half bought! I was gifted my car seat and stroller, my pack and play, and my baby holster. Loads of diapers are on the way. I totally hear the moms who don't want the attention but pragmatically, it's worth it to me to entertain baby games for 3 hours to make my family happy and be set for the baby too. To eacc their own though. I couldn't afford not to have one."
Mommit,ff6k2z1,t3_erxgul,1579628884.0,"I mean, if we could all stop judging other women in general that would be great. I'm soon to be a working mom in a neighborhood/town where the men work in tech and the women are socialite empty nesters or stay at home moms. I've already been told that I'll have to enlist my mother in law for school volunteering because there will be shade if I am not doing it as regularly as the other moms. In my situation, my choices are the ones being judged. Different strokes for different folks. The world would be more tolerable if we could all just accept and respect one another's decisions. Just because you're doing it differently than me does not mean I'm judging you and it does not mean that you or I must be wrong."
audiology,ff6i5og,t3_erwfdp,1579627714.0,"Asha has a website. I would recommend that you send an exploratory email to it asking your questions. You will likely have to take the praxis exam and prove you have a certain number of supervised clinical hours. Even then, it's a doctoral level profession for any new licensees so you may have to complete an additional program to be licensed as an audiologist here. On the flip side, you can certainly transition over as a hearing instrument specialist but requirements differ from state to state on requisites for that."

pregnant,ff4njre,t3_eriiq5,1579567942.0,"I started touring in October and our baby is due April. We both have pretty decent paying jobs so childcare is expensive but me working is still going to bring home more money than staying home. My state has strict laws for how many children per adult there can be so the cost of childcare is something to budget for. One place I toured said it was 2200 per month for an infant. Wtf. They're insane.   It got to a point where we had to call around just asking who had openings during our time frame. I lucked out with the place I found. It's on both of our commute paths, they allow 7am to 530pm drop offs and it's only 300/week. Only. Yea. We maxed out our dependent FSAs so at least we're paying for it pretax..."
pregnant,ff2xc7u,t1_ff2w1tb,1579527606.0,Yea that would be really nice. I probably wouldn't even take it necessarily but it'd be nice to have the option to at least see my baby make it to 6 months with vaccines and such before going into full time day care.
pregnant,ff2roia,t1_ff2m221,1579521127.0,I keep thinking about that due date and I've been trying to be really proactive about setting up the baby's things and having my shower early. You just are confirming for me that is rather be prepared early than assume I'll make it. Five weeks is a huge difference in timelines!

lupus,fexv1d1,t3_eqrvnj,1579437013.0,"Hey so my symptoms were night sweats (for years), heavy periods, joint pain and stiffness, fatigue. I too have ""rosacea"" according to my rheum. I was diagnosed with lupus but had been diagnosed with Hashimotos in that process and I'm telling you that after 8 weeks of hormone replacement I felt world's better. No more sweats, stiffness, and periods are light and regular. The lupus was diagnosed after presence of Sjogrens and antiphospholipid antibodies were seen in lab tests. I basically have every criteria except my symptoms are mild compared to other cases. Fatigue remains even on plaquenil but I've adjusted. Just wanted to let you know, the Hashimotos may be causing more of the symptoms than anything else..."

hearing,fexpmjn,t1_fewn0do,1579434484.0,"With ideopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, you have a 60% chance of hearing spontaneously recovering to some degree, even without steroids. All studies with intratympanic steroid injections (the most aggressive form of ""salvage"" steroid treatment directly to the source) agree with those numbers, meaning there is no proof that steroids do anymore than no steroids, but it's something worth trying since  the benefits could outweigh the risks. The steroids have shown only to be truly helpful within 24 hours of the loss occuring but no research has been able to prove any gain above spontaneous recovery rates out side of that 24-48 hr window. Recovery will never be full. It's defined by a 10dB or greater restoration in thresholds in most of these studies. So... Better but not healed. An ENT may prescribe steroids as a last ditch effort if the loss has been present more than 2 weeks but it won't actually do anything. The loss is time sensitive because the inflammation the steroids would treat is already long gone with your hearing by then. I would expect to have hearing loss permanently but you won't know how much until your next test. I've only had one patient who's hearing continued to change post loss and it did take roughly 6 months to see stabilization in testing but she also originally had a total loss of hearing and it restored to only moderate to severe levels. In all likelihood, the status of your hearing is already stable but they will recommend a test in 3 months to monitor. Another possibility to note, once steroids have been exhausted as an option, you may want to check in with your PCP regarding strokes/TIAs. It's not likely, but then again neither is ISSNHL. It's just another avenue to explore for the cause of your single sided loss.

Source: wrote my thesis on this subject while in clinical rotation at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. See research by Dr. Steven Rauch for more info on steroid use for tx of ISSNHL."
audiology,fexny47,t3_equ0in,1579433774.0,"I have had patients ask me out because they misinterpreted my helpfulness and my compassion for romantic interest. Personally it was extremely awkward. With the first patient it ever happened with I was polite and declined as best I could without hurting his feelings. He asked me out two more times in 3 years and I eventually had to refer him to another office because it was becoming an issue. The other two who made similar proposals never came back to me for follow-up. I have a few older men who make very inappropriate comments but I've resolved that issue by requesting that their wives and girl friends attend. All I'm saying is, if you like having her as your audiologist, make sure you can back out of the actions and save face. I've had female older patients who have invited me to get coffee and they are fascinating worldly women! And I've had to decline because it's not appropriate. We appreciate the rapport we have with our patients but it's really fucking awkward when you are a young female professional and you're getting hit on while performing medicine. It personally made me feel like I was still a little girl who was not being respected. At the very least, wait until the end of the appointment to give your gift/note."
hearing,fevti8b,t3_eqobx7,1579401291.0,"Once you've stabilized the residual hearing, you will most certainly still have some form of sensory hearing loss. To me, it's a no brainier that every thing sounds pitchy because when you remove bass, all you have left is treble. I would be interested if the effect resolves with the use of a hearing aid to restore the bass range. If not, or if your hearing loss resolves but you still have these symptoms, you may have Diplacusis."

That last thing I wanted was to be waiting til the month of the birth to be putting a nursery together. So I am having my shower at 28 weeks. It's early, but both planners have big vacations in March and in late Feb so early Feb is what it is. I almost feel bad that my goers won't get to see a massive uncomfortable bump, but im appreciative that I didn't get any push back. I hear your concerns.

AskReddit,feqwut0,t1_feouh1s,1579346953.0,"It took about a year of therapy in grad school to finally break myself of this insecurity. Turns out I had abandonment and self worth issues I didn't know how to cope with (a continued thanks to you, Dad), and despite being a intelligent, ambitious, hard worker, I felt like I had something to prove. I'm so happy to have the friendships of other strong women now. I'm so happy that I don't have to pretend to be strong or unemotional anymore. I'm so happy that I feel more myself than I've ever felt."
audiology,fenb965,t3_eq2pp8,1579280980.0,"You can certainly cause damage to more internal structures than just your outer hair cells, as we now know. The organ of corti has been shown to be damaged after exposure as well. I agree you can have more high frequency testing done but there is no restoration available for that hearing, if it is lost. I've seen a few people post about feeling certain tones carry a distortion despite normal hearing, and this is called Diplacusis. Your best bet is to protect yourself from here on out because unfortunately once the damage is done, it's not likely to heal itself in the future. You can only prevent further damage."

audiology,fejfs57,t3_ephe8x,1579172113.0,"I mean, it's like saying you want to be a dentist or a lawyer or a doctor, but you don't feel up to the demanding course work. Yea. You don't become that option then. If school isn't for you, try becoming an HIS or an aud tech if you're still passionate about the field. The pay is not great but if you're good at sales you can earn a decent living as an HIS. If you just scared because it's a big commitment... I'm sure anyone feels that way when embarking on a career specific education. It's not to be taken lightly but I had no problem with the school work and the clinicals. Was it worth the money? I've been crafty with my career to maximize my license and salary but I've seen classmates go part time and be stay at home moms after school because their hospital pay was not worth it to them over childcare. Figure out if you are passionate about this because you could spend less money training in a trade and probably could earn more money doing it, if that were your only goal."
personalfinance,fei1t2s,t3_ep6pyk,1579128419.0,"My husband works for a non profit and I work for a large corporation. Both companies employ >1500 people. His company provides 4 weeks of PTO per year that can be rolled over, 4 weeks of fully paid paternity leave and our insurance plan has a $200 deductible with no coinsurance for maternity related costs. To contrast, I get 3 weeks of PTO every year, none of which rolls over, no paid maternity leave, and if I were on the insurance provided, I would have a 3k deductible with a 20% coinsurance until a $6600 out of pocket max is met. 

He's taking his full paternity leave plus 6 weeks of PTO to help me care for our first child in April. I get to take 6 weeks of short term disability at 60%. I don't have any PTO accrued yet for this year.

Getting your HIS means you can earn income, not just as a tech but as a hearing aid specialist/salesperson. You may decide you want to make more money at some point and it's an opportunity for growth if you like the industry.
