dogs,ffgepnm,t1_fffbh5i,1579904575.0,"That’s exactly what I mean, even if there’s no euthanize list, the rescue is still not benefitting the dog when it could be. Like the other person mentioned, there could be nearby areas/countries with more strays that need homes. Usually shelters provide immunizations before any dog leaves, so that should mean the dog wouldn’t pass anything to your current pup."
dogs,ffeyv5z,t3_et892u,1579870780.0,"Honestly this is ridiculous to me when I hear about rescues being incredibly picky like this. I get wanting some background check especially since many rescues come from homes of neglect and having the dog go through that again would be devastating. However, there are SO many dogs that need homes, and good people like you and even people who don’t have as much experience with dogs but can provide them with a warm home and get them off a euthanize list is better than the alternative. One rescue I was volunteering with was thinking about denying someone a puppy because of the potential adopter’s age. The puppy was set to be euthanized a week later!! Give this young person the damn dog! I’m sorry you’re going through this, and I hope it eventually works out."
puppy101,ffey7it,t3_et8uxj,1579870148.0,"Low risk areas should be fine, dogs have made it in far worse conditions. Usually a puppy goes through 3 rounds of DHPPL, and is considered safe a week after the 3rd round which is typically 12 weeks like you mentioned. Parvo is mainly a risk in contact with dogs like the park and doggie daycare. Areas with puddles and things your puppy can eat is also a no go, but as far as never being able to put your puppy down, that’s not necessary. Just be mindful of the area you want to set them down in."
rareinsults,ffdduia,t1_ffc1l81,1579818798.0,"I’d recommend the podcast “The Dropout”. It goes into how she was able to fool so many people, and how it all caught up to her eventually."
rareinsults,ffbv9i1,t3_esrw8n,1579783929.0,She purposely tried to mimic Steve Jobs. She also purposely lowered her voice to get it to a more authoritative octave. Crazy. But it worked for a while and had millions fooled.
dogs,ffbfqxx,t3_esnrz2,1579763320.0,"I’m not sure taking her back would be the best option. Of course she could adjust to living with you again, but how does the person who currently has her feel? I know I personally could not keep a dog that long without falling in love. If they are fully on board with giving her back, taking her immediately shouldn’t be too much of a problem unless you’re able to do more frequent visits before that happens. Dogs are resilient more than we give them credit for, but millions of shelter dogs that aren’t puppies adjust to being in new homes so it is entirely possible. Good luck!"
AtoZplasticsurgery,ff5gc52,t3_erf0kw,1579591640.0,I don’t see a difference. And her BS speech at the very beginning was hilarious. I was completely hooked watching it though!
Noses,fe5sup7,t1_fe2t980,1578874193.0,I love her! And she does have a striking nose
Hair,fe0kcmg,t1_fe072s9,1578814909.0,I immediately thought Princess Bride! But I couldn’t pin point if I thought he was more Wesley or Buttercup. Definitely looks like their child.
Dogberg,fe00zxo,t3_ene4w9,1578800430.0,"My two dogs do the same thing. One always gets impatient when they both stop to sniff something and decides to go right under the belly of my other dog.

Noses,fdpddeh,t1_fdpanqs,1578625776.0,"Thank you! From my front profile my nose is crooked to the left where the airways follow, so maybe that zig zag will be straightened."
rarepuppers,fdp3zuc,t1_fdo9fjh,1578619461.0,"Some places have overflowing shelters, like the shelter I volunteer for. We get lots of beautiful, pure bred dogs that take ages to get adopted just because there are hundreds of others. Behavioral issues can also keep people away, and fosters are a huge help to get those dogs situated before they find a permanent home."
Weddingsunder10k,fdljpql,t3_elzlxe,1578525578.0,"Those are gorgeous! I just stalked through your posts to see if you had a picture of your dress because I’m so intrigued. Colorful hair and these boots will already make quite a statement, I can’t imagine what the dress will look like."
puppy101,fdj2zjr,t1_fdj2oji,1578457091.0,"Haha damn I have no idea what’s coming for me when my pup hits 9 months to a year. I also got another dog and they play with each other and wear each other out. I fostered dogs when he was super young before I got my second dog, and they helped him so much with some bad habits since he was taken from his mom too young."
puppy101,fdj2125,t3_elmcjn,1578456403.0,"Ugh I have a 7 month old border collie and I hear you. He is driving me insane! He wants to put everything in his mouth, and sprint the day away. I recently neutered him because he scaled a fence and cut his leg to get to a lady dog in heat and was marking and humping everything! After neutering those habits completely went away. He also calmed down immensely. He’s still an asshole puppy at times, but spaying and neutering does help with crazy behavior."
AgeGapRelationship,fdie8c8,t3_el7gph,1578440911.0,"You’re the same age as my sister and she has the same age gap with her boyfriend. I was absolutely not worried about it when she told me. When you’re in your 20s that shouldn’t be a concern. It’s nobody’s business but lots of people think it’s their place to say something. Also to add, as a female when I was in my early 20s there’s no way I would date the men my age, the maturity gap is insane between early 20s men and women."
PetTheDamnDog,fdg74su,t3_el3ib9,1578382764.0,My Brittany does the exact same thing! They’re so attention aggressive
Weddingsunder10k,fc1gkgd,t3_efhc5w,1577318123.0,My engagement ring is also an emerald! With Celtic designs in the sides. I’m not a diamond fan so I love seeing other rings that stray a bit from the traditional stone.
