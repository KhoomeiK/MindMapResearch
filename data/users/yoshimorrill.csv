AmItheAsshole,ffdlo3b,t3_eswfv6,1579823521.0,"YTA. This is her life. Those dogs are important to her. There are a lot of people out there who fight over pets in a split and it sounds like they are being adult and amicable about the situation.

Do you have to like it? No. But my guess is this has been a thing since when you two first got together. You knew this was part of the deal. If you don't like it, then leave. Simple as that."

aww,fcow4u9,t1_fcov3ch,1577843200.0,Theodore. Because he likes cuddles the most. (Far left)
aww,fcow0in,t1_fconlnw,1577843106.0,Far left (Theodore) is super different from his supposed brothers. He's way more fluffy and shorter.
aww,fcovy9x,t1_fcoj1qh,1577843057.0,The whining and the peeing and the pooping
aww,fcovxlg,t1_fcoiwra,1577843043.0,Puppies usually go super quick once they are ready for adoption. We usually take puppies a few weeks before they're ready then they get snatched up pretty much immediately.
