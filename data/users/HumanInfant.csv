The reality is that when you drive dangerously, people are likely to die even if that wasn’t the intention. What I, and the others on the thread are saying is that if ANYONE in this situation were to die (which is VERY likely) at least it was the person who was responsible for the accident, and the person wasn’t responsible for any other deaths.

The only way to fix it really is to wean your hair off it over time.

If you are eating a calorie deficit consistently you will absolutely loose weight, even if you are eating pure sugar, and even if that pure sugar is eaten all at once. Yes you will take in more sugar than your cells can do anything with at that time, and yes much of that excess will be stored short term (NOTE: as glycogen, not fat), but during the course of the day it will be used up and the body will have to start breaking down tissue for more energy. That is literally the definition of a calorie deficit.

That is not to say that getting all your calories from pure carbs is even approaching a good idea. The fact that your blood sugar would spike so much in such a short period will probably cause some insulin resistance in the cells over time. Not to mention the complete lack of any protein will mean that much of the body tissue being broken down will be muscle, which isn’t good for you, not to mention the lack of fibre and micronutrients. You will get VERY SICK, but you will 100% still lose weight


If you are eating at a calorie surplus, but it’s mostly protein and fat with not much carb, you will still gain body fat no matter what. The definition of calorie surplus is that you are getting more energy than you will use. If that energy is in the form of amino acids and lipids, then your body will need to convert them to glucose first, but it will still end up creating body mass.


Literally the only way to eat more calories than you use and NOT gain weight is if you eat your meals with a side order of laxatives and it all ends up in the toilet before it gets to your blood. Or if you have Crohn’s disease or caeliacs ( same idea, guts don’t work so food doesn’t get absorbed resulting in everything painfully and horribly ending up in the toilet)"
AskReddit,fcmd7p4,t1_fclnk2s,1577771123.0,"???? No ????
Insulin is the hormone that tells your cells to take in glucose from your blood.  What happens to it from there is up to your cells.

The glucose is used by the cells and excess is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles. If there’s still glucose left over it will be stored as fat. If you don’t eat an excess of calories, there will be no excess to store as fat, even if you have LOTS of insulin in your blood.

If you eat a lot of sugar and your body DOESN’T produce insulin, or if your cells ignore the signal from the insulin (like if they’re already saturated with glucose), then sure, the extra glucose won’t be taken into your cells and stored as fat. Instead it will stay in your blood causing all SORTS of issues stemming mainly from your blood now having weird osmotic pressure. This is diabetes in a nut shell

If gains are your goal then gaining 1kg a month is GOOD

The next thing to track is protein

You seem to think that macronutrients don’t matter and kcal is the only thing that matters. That is only true if your only goal is WEIGHTLOSS

YOUR goal is to gain muscle, that can’t happen unless you eat enough PROTEIN. Aim for 150g a day.

Also give up on this dream that calisthenics is the same as weight lifting, pick up a barbell and get on a weightlifting programme or you will literally never reach your goal"
xxfitness,fc5xqyk,t1_fc4z7as,1577468098.0,No one in any industry recommends 1200 for long term weight loss. Everything I’ve read/heard from professional weight loss advice says 1200 is a minimum and should only be for a 2 week crash diet type deal. The people on reddit who eat 1200 calories are very short and sedentary or they have some other metabolic issue going on. Or they’re super morbidly obese and NEED to lose weight NOW or they are at immediate risk of death. Most normal or over weight (not obese) people shouldn’t be taking the advice given in my 600 lb life as something they should do too
