fatlogic,feg43nu,t1_feerpw6,1579076024.0,"Pretty fucking much. My housemate was about 330 pounds and has lost 30 pounds over the last 3 months and you know what he said the other day? How glad he is that tying his shoes isn't a struggle anymore and how all these ""little"" things are so much better and how he doesn't feel depressed about them anymore. THAT is the important thing these FAs ignore every damn time."
fatlogic,fc1vety,t1_fc1eq5s,1577330932.0,"Yeah, that's an issue I see too. I think that is why they argue so hard for the idea that they can't control their weight - so they can claim they are in the same situation as the chronically ill, the mentally ill, and anyone else who has conditions that hinder their health that are beyond their control."
fatlogic,fc1vaef,t1_fc1jpiy,1577330820.0,"I think a big issue with HAES is that they really want to claim the ableism label. Like, there are no issues with ""healthier is better"" and you should try to be healthy for your sake and others. There are issues with how people push the idea, in some instances where someone's ""healthy"" will never be as ""healthy"" as another's due to factors beyond their control (e.g. all of the ""oh? You're depressed? Try yoga / think positively / etc"").

But that's why HAES loves to claim weight is beyond their control - so that someone saying ""lose weight"" is as morally imperialistic and ignorant as telling a depressed person to ""just think positively"". They literally just want to co-op the claims of other movements."
