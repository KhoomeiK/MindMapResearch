technology,fddx6dv,t1_fddtomn,1578326153.0,"Not most.

Some companies focus on getting the cheapest, and so they focus on cost up and down the value chain. Amazon, alibaba, frys

Differentiated companies, like Apple, Mercedes (which has garbage quality these days), lululemon, etc would never focus on cost. In fact, they hate using numbers in their marketing. Youâ€™ll hardly ever see Apple touting GHz or GBs because then customers could directly compare specs to other computers (which you can do on your own if you know what youâ€™re looking for). This strategy takes a lot of marketing power, and you pretty much have to babysit how special the value of each operation is along the value chain."

There really isnâ€™t much to making drugs. Usually you just boil away a solvent to make the controlled substance more concentrated.

No, you probably canâ€™t compare opium to engineered morphine, but I imagine people would be wrecked more than if they took a few hits from a cannabis vapor cartridge."
