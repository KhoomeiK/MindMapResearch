Slightly out of topic, but you got me curious here. I used to have a cockatiel, who indeed woke up super scared every now and then and started running around super frightened in his cage. I now have a green cheek conure, there was some loud noise a few nights ago, I immediately woke up to check on her, and she was perfectly fine in her cage, like nothing happened.

I got her on Friday evening (I wouldn't recommend picking yours in the evening if you can do otherwise...), got her in her cage as soon as she arrived home (she was totally fine with that, but if your carrier fits easily in the cage, you might wanna leave it in the cage, opened, so your bird can have a safe spot it's kind of familiar with - and smaller, so it's usually better when they're scared). I stuck around for a little while, made sure she saw where the food and water were, and then left the room. It was the evening so she most likely went to sleep pretty soon after that. The next morning, I waited for her to move (the room gets sunlight, and I've got a Nest Hub Max there, I used its camera to check on her without being seen), walked into the room, and she went straight for the cage's door - despite being seemingly comfortable in the cage before seeing me (she went to eat, and didn't look nervous whatsoever). I took her out, and spent some time with her, she was super happy. I eventually got her back in her cage and left the room for a few hours - and repeated that over the day. The (really few) times she didn't went straight for the door, I stayed in the room doing something else, keeping the cage closed.

She seems to be super happy both inside and outside of her cage a week later (even the next day really... she's been amazing), so I'm pretty happy with that process. YMMV of course.

Enjoy your soon-to-be feathery friend :-)"

Your comment is absolutely on point, and I just wanted to emphasize that. I got a green cheek conure a week ago (not my first bird, I used to have cockatiels, I knew what to expect), I have been postponing doing anything else than going at work and taking care of her for a week, now. She's amazing, and I love spending time with her, but she requires a lot of attention - and it's usual for a parrot. Don't get one on a whim. Think about how your life would change if you suddenly got a kid. That's a pretty similar situation... (Except the parrots sleep fine at night, so that's nice.)"

Understatement of the year.

Also, no: the drivers are 99% of the time proprietary blobs that aren't compatible with newer versions of Android and/or the Linux kernel. Individuals often work on a new, from scratch implementation, sometimes without any specs from the chips manufacturers. Which for a phone manufacturer would most of the time be 1) stupidly expensive, 2) a breach of contract with the chip supplier.

Yes, phones manufacturers have huge incentives to not update old hardware. But no, claiming that it would be easy and straightforward for them to do it, or even possible, is just not true."

If you have something to feed them (they're honey eaters, most stores around here sell some kind of nectar powder that they love - just don't feed them too much, they're wild animals and should absolutely not become dependent of you feeding them), some of them would happily jump on your hand/shoulder to get easier access to the food. They're beautiful, curious and playful! Enjoy :-)"
