horsegirlfilm,fh5bjof,t1_fh42l3x,1581287181.0,"Yes, I could see this. But man, it’s so hard to say when you try to fit these theories into everything else she experienced. This movie was a trip."
horsegirlfilm,fh5bd6m,t1_fh58y6x,1581287100.0,"Wait this could make sense — there is a ton of time jumping (so it seems) anyway. So to build on your theory, our first meeting with Sarah and Ethan was actually Sarah’s second meeting with him... but she was discharged after the first one. How did she meet with Ethan again? Aaaaand why do the people from the stables hate her so much? Probably because she had a mental breakdown and stole the horse. After the final scene when she was abducted, she must’ve come back some days after that and got in loads of legal trouble and was re-admitted... which then took us back to Ethan for the second meeting and through whatever happened in the middle of the movie."
Sims3,fh4v2i6,t3_f1birm,1581282340.0,"I’ve been playing since Sims 2 came out and am well-versed in 2, 3, and 4. I have all the packs for 4 and am a frequent player, but recently went back to 3 just for the hell of it. There are only two main reasons I’m finding myself playing it more and more: open world and story progression (NPCs and other sims marry, have kids, get jobs without my meddling). Also, the graphics are kind of low compared to 4, which actually makes me focus more on gameplay than my Sims’ appearances and homes. In 4, I’ll spend literal hours perfecting that stuff and then get bored of gameplay."
horsegirlfilm,fh4pll3,t1_fh4o705,1581280956.0,"Makes total sense, thanks. I have no idea how stables or owning horses works so that clears it all up."
thisisus,fh41gkn,t3_f1cv48,1581274241.0,"Since you’re only on season two, you’re bound to find some spoilers in this sub so be careful. I’m caught up so I don’t want to influence your opinion but yes, Kevin definitely has many issues to work out and never seems to learn from his mistakes, which might be what makes him super unwatchable."
Writeresearch,fh3u6ng,t1_fh3g1f4,1581272370.0,"Yes that’s fine. If a boxer got a tattoo on his bicep, he really doesn’t have to cover that up but in other instances, covering with clothing might be helpful. Legit rock climbing, for example, can scratch you so you probably want to protect a fresh tattoo from anything like that. You’ll also want to avoid swimming (submerging in water) and direct sunlight (no beach days unless it’s covered appropriately). 

You might feel a bit sore around the tattoo spot those first few days but the most annoying part is the peeling and itching a week or so later."
Writeresearch,fh3e59k,t3_f1allw,1581267983.0,"I can help answer here so other users with similar questions can get some info. I’ve got a few tattoos and one is pretty large (1+ foot in length). 

Large tattoos like this will take anywhere between 4-8 hours depending on how detailed it is. They have to outline and then color. That’s usually two sessions but people can sit through one if the pain isn’t that bad. Mine are flowers on my rib cage which is very bony and very very painful, so I wanted to split it up into a couple 3-hour sessions.

Depending on where the tattoo is being done, the canvas might not be able to move much at all. But if it’s on the leg, then they can watch tv or go on their phone or eat. Artists will not let you drink a beer because alcohol thins the blood which is dangerous for tattooing. In my situation, I had to lay still face down for hours. I could sort of see the TV, lol. 

Healing is a couple weeks long. Antibacterial soap and water in the shower and ointment like A&D should be applied several times a day. The skin will peel and get really itchy which is normal but it eventually just looks normal again. The coloring will be a little different once it’s completely healed too."
thisisus,fh3d0nn,t1_fh2lvbl,1581267590.0,I’d agree with you but we’re four seasons in. I don’t think it’s considered instant gratification anymore lol.
horsegirlfilm,fh1w5ij,t3_f0l7ex,1581226040.0,"I can only theorize on why she knew what Molly Shannon (Joan) was going to say. I just watched this so I’m still interpreting but I think she knew what Joan was going to say because she’d heard it somewhere else before. She’d been in that moment before, witnessed or lived it one way or another. There was also lot of time jumping here, like when she met with Ethan the first time (to us and Sarah) but didn’t remember their *actual* first meeting. 

Which then begs the question, how did Sarah get to that second meeting with Ethan if she was discharged after their first one? And if my theory is right, then how would she know what Joan was going to say? Agh, I don’t know. Maybe she came back after her final abduction and it wasn’t a bittersweet ending after all."
horsegirlfilm,fh1vpk4,t3_f0lsi2,1581225650.0,I just finished this a few minutes ago and need to digest. There are so many damn questions.
TrueOffMyChest,fguw81c,t3_f0itn6,1581130811.0,It’s a fucking pain to keep up with being baby butt smooth. I’ll shave the nether regions to avoid mess during periods but I don’t care what my pubic bone area looks like. Thank you for saying this.

TrueOffMyChest,fgsyyu8,t3_f08naa,1581095574.0,"The million-dollar question. I too became a contractor and moved to the cheapest state in the US to stay afloat with my finances. My partner on the other hand hasn’t been able to find any work for 10 months since he was laid off last spring. He has professional experience in marketing and writing and has applied to retail, corporate, freelance — but nothing happens. Every job has 100+ applicants. Indeed and LinkedIn are 100% useless. Upwork is a possibility but they all have dozens of applicants within minutes of posting and the site takes 30% of your payment anyway. It’s just such BS. What are you supposed to do?"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fgsylbh,t3_f04iub,1581095349.0,"My dad gave me one year after I graduated college to save enough and find my own place. It might sound harsh, but I think we were both done being each other’s roommate."
needadvice,fgr78sz,t3_f02n76,1581039864.0,"Hey friend, I am sooooo understanding of this. I hate flying but since I live 1600 miles away from my friends and family, I find myself on planes more often than I’d like (and they’re always layovers).

A good piece of advice I got from somebody else was to close your eyes and count backwards from 10 during takeoff. Most often by the time you reach 1, you’re already smooth sailing in the air.

I also prefer to sit by the window. I like to see my surroundings and see what’s going on. Anytime I feel turbulence, I look at my surroundings: outside, the stewardesses, the seatbelt symbol. It takes a lot for a plane to malfunction, and there are two trained pilots up there who pretty much know what they’re doing. 

Lastly, perhaps think of flying like a vacation in itself. You get to do something you don’t do every day! You can make it joyous. Watch a movie on the flight, play a game at the bar before you board, buy a book, explore the terminals, etc, to ease anxiety. Also, be sure to get through TSA at least an hour before take off so you can take time to relax and settle in. 

If I think of anything else, I’ll add my two cents."
TheRanch,fgqa55l,t1_fgp8tem,1581020651.0,It’s her money.
TheRanch,fgq9uj5,t1_fgq97ag,1581020522.0,"I still think this a huge jump. *We* both might know that you have to match the game to the console, but there are people who don’t! She’s in rural CO too. Maybe she’s not huge into electronics. Maybe she never sees Colt play. She just might not be familiar with what’s current, even if she’s teaching kids. 

I don’t mean to bring a personal example in, but I also taught kids and didn’t know what the hell was hot and new either. I’ve also made mistakes relevant to this before. It’s not that I “don’t care,” it’s that I got confused about what’s what or didn’t understand perfectly.

At the end of the day, Abby still tried for his birthday and for Christmas. Would you really scold your SO for trying like this? It’s the thought that counts—and it’s easily fixable."
TheRanch,fgq726c,t1_fgq68su,1581019078.0,"First of all, on Colt’s birthday, Abby told him that she called Best Buy and they were sold out. So she tried. 

Secondly, Abby was not intentionally fucking with Colt. I think you’re looking too much into that. I don’t know anyone who would intentionally spend $60 on the wrong game just to fuck with their SO. That’s a whole other trip to the store to exchange it. That doesn’t even match her character. She clearly doesn’t game and might not have known the difference."
TheRanch,fgq5h5z,t1_fgq3x7u,1581018229.0,"I actually do think Abby and Colt are compatible. They balance each other out nicely in spite of their flaws. She’s grounded but can match his sense of humor and small antics, like stealing a milkshake from a kid at Dairy Queen. Colt is up in the sky and excitable, whose high dreams and confidence bring them good things (sometimes). Really, they enjoy each other’s company and actually had chemistry on-screen.

Now, on the other hand, we don’t know anything about Heather. Their “relationship” was very forced. She was sweet and matched Colt’s maturity level for sure, but even they decided to just be friends. If they continued what they were doing in the beginning, I think the sex would’ve stopped when one of them moved onto a relationship (which is what happened). There’s not much to base on in terms of compatibility aside from the small piece of personality we got to see, which even then isn’t enough to base a good argument on. Even in the last season we have no idea who Heather truly is. She was used for a plot point."
TheRanch,fgq4c58,t1_fgq3p6a,1581017621.0,"Those two examples are solid. Like Beau, I do think she kept getting pissed off that he’d come to her *after* doing something ridiculous. The man is a bit of a loose cannon when it comes to decision-making, which anybody could admit. 

But the COD thing is way silly. I keep seeing this all over the sub. Take a look at the timeline. Colt wanted it for his birthday, which is in between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Abby didn’t get it for his birthday, but got it for Christmas. I’m not sure what the issue is there."
thisisus,fgq3tjy,t1_fgq3hf4,1581017347.0,"Right. I think many viewers fall into some of the characters’ minds and get lost with which way is up.   Nobody seems to really like Miguel, so the viewers, without reason, don’t either. I see this so often across the sub with the Kevin/Sophie and Kate/Toby situations too."
TheRanch,fgpurjg,t1_fgpucn2,1581012401.0,"Could you cite instances where Abby was a hypocrite? Just can’t think of a time off the top of my head. 

And that’s true—Heather and Colt would’ve been a dream team, but I think it would be scary if they both worked on a struggling ranch. Abby does have her own career and a guaranteed salary, which is helpful in many ways. Of course, at the end of the day, whose career path is what doesn’t really matter as much as who’s more compatible."
TheRanch,fgpq5ae,t1_fgp7rl3,1581009838.0,Interesting point! I think you’re spot on with the last sentence too.
TheRanch,fgpq2wc,t1_fgoipwv,1581009800.0,"I can see this, but I also think Mary’s presence when Luke arrived was a little overdone. And obviously without Mary, there wouldn’t have been Heather to “grow” that last season."
TheRanch,fgppwvg,t1_fgok5a9,1581009705.0,"These are good points about Abby. And it’s also true what you said about Heather:

> Since she wasn’t a main character, all we saw was the good things she did so it’s easier to love Heather and hate Abby.

If so, then isn’t it easy to admit that we don’t know anything about Heather? I mean, if she’d ended up with Colt, we might’ve seen her flaws and realized we didn’t really like her either. 

Arguably, I think Abby was a more realistic option for Colt’s life goals. Heather *was* likely more his speed, but they were solely built on sex and I think that would’ve eventually fizzled out. They probably would’ve gone back to being friends, and Colt would’ve been chasing down Abby anyway, because that’s the one he wanted most."
TheRanch,fgppcwg,t1_fgp6p4z,1581009389.0,Abby had to almost leave him for Colt to grow up and realize how he was treating their relationship.
TheRanch,fgpomq3,t1_fgoh6es,1581008979.0,"Look, not to sound a certain way, but just because Abby was at her wit’s end with Colt doesn’t mean she’s a bitch. She communicated with Colt very regularly about her thoughts and frustrations, tried to remind him to think his decisions through — but Colt never did really listen, did he? Good intentions or not, he truly was a teenage boy in a grown man’s body that probably didn’t realize how much growing up he had to do when he wanted to settle down with Abby. 

Heather was probably more Colt’s speed. She was, what, 15 years his junior? and would have a ton of fun just hanging out with Colt, if that’s what he wanted."
thisisus,fgpn711,t1_fgpaqlj,1581008177.0,"Ah, well, to each their own. The Big Three were in their 20s — maybe 30s? — when Miguel and Rebecca got together. Nobody’s replacing anybody at that point, and it’s silly that they have such one-track minds if so. 

Both my parents remarried in my 20s and now I have two sets, but I don’t think anyone’s “replacing” each other. They’re adults who can do what they want. I’m not a child who’s unable to tell the difference, and neither are Randall, Kate, and Kevin. It’s quite silly if they feel slighted by Miguel. What, did they want Rebecca to stay single forever?"
thisisus,fgpmqlx,t3_ezqqqn,1581007921.0,"I agree with you. There’s no real reason anybody should dislike Miguel. In fact, I think the writers are writing him in a way where most people feel neutral or don’t really care about him. Fact is that he’s human and he’s got his own stories too. 

He’s no Jack, but that’s okay. He’s not trying to be. He got together with Rebecca years after Jack passed away. The kids were already adults and out of the house. They clearly don’t see him as a fatherly figure. Maybe some people think it’s odd that Miguel was Jack’s best friend, but that’s kind of a win-win. Miguel is a good man whom they’ve known their whole lives. 

They should, quite frankly, be relieved that Rebecca found happiness again. But, as we know, the Big Three all miss Jack and leave Rebecca in the dust. This poor woman will never live up to Jack, and neither will Miguel."

TheRanch,fgodhpe,t1_fgj2r7e,1580966411.0,Her kid is full grown and she hasn’t been around most of the show anyway. She was drifting away as is. She shouldn’t have to stay in a place she’s not happy in anymore because her 36 y/o son will miss her.

Toby’s not perfect either, but he’s been to therapy and is on medication. Arguably, this is the first time we’ve seen Toby be less than ideal. He’s tolerated a bunch of stuff and overcome trauma from his childhood. It’s time for Kate to do the same."

They’re not improving at all, which was a major disappointment. I guess I just thought for 4 dudes who did funny stuff for a living, I’d get some loose improv here and there. 

It’s a fun experience because you still laugh (if you can get past the forced script-reading) and it’s nice to see them in person, but I wouldn’t expect a personalized show or anything."

Now, I wouldn’t recommend you’d say this to a person you’re on a date with. Since Netflix and chill is purely sex-driven, you probably don’t want to come off that strong on a first date.
