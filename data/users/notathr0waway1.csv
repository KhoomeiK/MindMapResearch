nova,ff71zhv,t1_ff6umek,1579639523.0,"> VDOT reports that typically only a couple of cars ever actually pay that ~$40 price so most of the traffic is still hov.

Does VDOT publish the data?  How awesome would it be if it just posted the anonymized data.  Like entry point, entry time, exit point, exit time, and each has a unique trip ID (no vehicle or transponder ID, that way you can't correlate across days and find patterns leading to individual identification.).  

That should be part of every contract (like Hogan's Toll Lanes in MD).  If a company is going to make bank, you must be transparent with the data.

It would also give economists a *field day* with a true real-world price elasticity of demand experiment."

BlackPeopleTwitter,ff4at5m,t1_ff498uo,1579559297.0,"Whitewash is a loaded term because in general it means something along the lines of ""papering over the cracks."". But in black culture specifically it can mean something along the lines of ""selling out to white culture.""

Either way, the mainstream definitely picks the most, shall we say, convenient facts to portray MLK's legacy."

I thought that blows to the back of the head were illegal in MMA, but I also see that it's not straight to the back of the head, but it's definitely behind the ear in at least one case.

But the ID thing is tricky.  It's important to be very strict about the authenticity of IDs when doing certain official things."
