nottheonion,ffvfi69,t1_ffuexdu,1580262906.0,"I agree that if the mom wasn't supplying diapers for her child, the daycare worker had every right to be angry. 




It's pretty horrible to write on a baby with Magic Marker though. It's not the kid's fault that the mom didn't supply diapers. One of my kids has very sensitive skin and would probably have a reaction to such a strong marker. There's no defending what the daycare worker did, in my mind. Punish the parent, not the baby. 



You don't write on people's kids with Magic Marker. That's nutty and I wouldn't want someone who behaved that way to watch my kid."

vegan,ffunbmo,t1_ffuibj5,1580245573.0,"I have vegan Doc Martens. If you didn't know better, you'd think they were leather (the tag is a different color and that's the only way to tell the difference). I also wear leather shoes that I got before going vegan because I'm not going to be wasteful on top of everything when the damage has already been done. 



My point being, there are several reasons you might see a vegan wearing what appears to be leather clothing."

I'm not a fan of Warren, but with all the shit that Trump has pulled with his blatant corruption, lifting environmental protections, cutting public aid, locking kids in cages, etc. I cannot see how anyone would want another 4 years of this guy. If Trump is the other option, yeah, I'll vote for Warren, but I'm banking on Bernie being the nominee and he's my top choice."

So, these poor girls really only got to experience and appreciate around a decade of life. It's so sad. I'm sure that Kobe would agree that the loss of the children is the most tragic part of this tragedy. Just a sad situation for all the families involved."
