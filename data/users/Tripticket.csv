history,ffav5od,t1_ff9vudy,1579745225.0,"It's been like ten years since I read about the history of Vietnam, but here's a quick summary on the topic:

The area around Vietnam is quite fertile and rice farming spread there relatively quickly from the river valleys in China, implying some Chinese origins. Once a proper state had formed there, it was difficult to invade due to the geography. However, China did come to meddle in north Vietnam several times and the south was dominated by the Cham (Austronesians) for a long period.

Thus it seems like the Vietnamese are probably a mix of several different ethnic groups that migrated to the region over a longer period. I'm sure someone from southeast Asia could elaborate on the ethnic differences within the region, as I would presume there are actually several groups that have remained somewhat distinct to this day, especially in the mountains inland regions."

This shouldn't normally happen because the gas canisters are supposed to be kept outside, and the gas never gets an opportunity to enter the house because it will just disperse into nature once it fills the space under your house. In this case, it couldn't, even though (or perhaps because) the house was built according to specifications of the time.

The pilot light of our refrigerator was at the bottom of the fridge (come to think of it, I've never seen gas-operated fridges with pilot lights anywhere but the bottom), so once the gas got into the kitchen it was pretty much game over. Because of the large amount of gas under the house that ignited very quickly, the initial fireball was very impressive.

Then I must have misunderstood, since you said:

Which in context sounds like a categorical rejection of philosophical works by people untrained in the field. Although from your other posts I gather that you mean that it's purely rhetoric and sophism which sounds much more advanced than it is because it lacks some fundamental quality of ""real"" works of philosophy?

> I've not really sure I understand what you're trying to say.

I'm saying that in some cases you can afford to be a little bit more generous to an author you're criticising because even if their arguments aren't as developed as they should, it's easy enough to develop them yourself from the source material, since it is quite exhaustive. If you're getting a degree in philosophy, you'll spend a lot of time doing exactly this. If not, you're not really arguing successfully against the idea the author has put forward as it will be easy enough to deflect any accusation with ""naturally I meant X instead of Y""."

This is important for understanding the rest of the text (since he'll be referring to this demographic throughout), and it's one of the most common ways to start a work of philosophy.

It's only laughable if you claim these kinds of people don't exist at all, which seems like kind of a stretch.

Edit: Reading the introduction again, he makes this abundantly clear, and commits several paragraphs purely to this. Here's a few:

> 7: During the first half of the 20th century leftism could have been practically identified with socialism. Today the movement is fragmented and it is not clear who can properly be called a leftist. When we speak of leftists in this article we have in mind mainly socialists, collectivists, “politically correct” types, feminists, gay and disability activists, animal rights activists and the like. But not everyone who is associated with one of these movements is a leftist. What we are trying to get at in discussing leftism is not so much movement or an ideology as a psychological type, or rather a collection of related types.

> 8: Even so, our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less clear than we would wish, but there doesn’t seem to be any remedy for this. All we are trying to do here is indicate in a rough and approximate way the two psychological tendencies that we believe are the main driving force of modern leftism. We by no means claim to be telling the WHOLE truth about leftist psychology.

> 23: We emphasize that the foregoing does not pretend to be an accurate description of everyone who might be considered a leftist. It is only a rough indication of a general tendency of leftism.

> 227: Our discussion of leftism has a serious weakness. It is still far from clear what we mean by the word “leftist.” There doesn’t seem to be much we can do about this. Today leftism is fragmented into a whole spectrum of activist movements. Yet not all activist movements are leftist, and some activist movements (e.g., radical environmentalism) seem to include both personalities of the leftist type and personalities of thoroughly un-leftist types



Thus, I think the only strawman (misunderstanding?) here is yours. It seems more like he's constructing some sort of psychological profile rather than implying party affiliation.

I agree that there's something a lot of writers lack when they try to produce philosophy but don't have understanding of basic method. However, it's not like whatever they produce can be discarded simply because they lack the training.

Reading the manifesto, there are a lot of arguments and propositions taken for granted that I wish he had developed further (e.g. paragraphs 13 and 18), but it's not like we are unable to mount those defences ourselves with a bit of effort.

todayilearned,fep1pj1,t1_feo529u,1579310169.0,"> Allowing for emergency services to still exist, and considering that autonomous vehicles are almost, but not quite there, would you give up the value cars provide to us in order to save +- 35,000 lives a year?

This is the same problem as the previous one. It takes into account the same morally relevant factors. If you are a consequentialist your value consideration just went from +40 000 utils to + 5000 utils. It's still morally commendable to have cars.

The most pressing complaints with either of the two thought experiments comes from intuitionists and deontologists. It's difficult to argue against either thought experiment from a consequentialist view, and the conclusion would likely be the same in both cases.

Intuitively, we might think there's something wrong with trading innocent lives for unrelated lives. If you want a more empirical base, consider the following: the lives saved by logistical innovation and emergency services are typically those of people who are elderly, sick, or possess bad habits. In most such cases, we'd intuitively prefer the ""average person"" to continue living, if forced to choose. However, cars force us to give up 40 000 ""average people"" for a weighted group of 35 000 ""lesser"" people.

Alternatively, the most straightforward deontological approach is to claim that all humans have some right to life. Assuming this, you can't just whoop in and take people's lives without their input in order to exchange them with other lives. If you want a morally rigorous example of a deontological argument that makes this case, just follow the second formulation of Kant's Imperative:

> So act as to treat humanity, both in your own person, and in the person of every other, always at the same time as an end, never simply as a means.

In this case, of course, you're treating the 40 000 victims merely as a means to save the 35 000 people.

Thus, most of the significant ethical theories that have an issue with the first thought experiment will have an issue with the second one as well, and vice versa."

The analogy to the lion only really makes sense if you are willing to grant him the same moral responsibility as you would to a non-human animal, which is obviously hugely problematic if it means you're granting animals responsibility rather than taking it away.

If he's insane past a certain degree, you could claim he's a moral patient because he doesn't have the ability to reason like a capable person. You could also argue that it doesn't eradicate his moral responsibility, but rather simply diminishes it. Both of these allow for you to claim that he isn't cruel while being impervious to the problems of categorically granting animals the same responsibilities and rights as humans. On the flip side you have to actually be able to show that he's insane.

It seems easier to establish cruelty if you disregard the insanity angle altogether because it circumvents the discussion of moral agency. However, the conclusion then hinges on which definition of cruelty you would use for your case, making the entire argument much weaker (it would be a more strong/general claim if you could demonstrate it for all reasonable definitions of cruelty). You'd have to figure out things such as whether intent establishes or plays a role in cruelty. Intuitively, we might want to say it does, but it seems that Mao and Hitler had good intentions (presuming their own premises would have been true) and making a moral argument in support of the Holocaust is kind of awkward.

At the same time, we might not want to disregard intent because we often commit to actions on the prediction that they will lead to a desirable outcome, and it's a fairly common argument for mitigating factors in everyday life. Besides, if the goodness of a deed depends solely on the realized outcome, we might think morality is unreasonably demanding because then being a good person becomes a practical impossibility.

Basically, it's a difficult question, and I'd have to think about it for much more than 15 minutes."

We think of animals as moral patients.

The way OP structured his post, it seems like Kaczynski never said that. It was the interviewer who recalled something his professor had said.

Either way, the obvious point of the anecdote is not ""two wrongs make a right"" but rather a questioning of moral intuition. If you can demonstrate that cars are morally acceptable, then it follows that what the Unabomber is attempting also is morally acceptable if it succeeds (provided the premises are correct). If the person who the anecdote was told to is an intuitionist, the argument could be fairly compelling (since otherwise they would have to think of cars as morally reprehensible, which isn't so attractive)."

Most of us probably share the intuitive feeling that there's something wrong with the equation because we believe that everyone has a basic right to life. This also follows the Kantian maxim of not treating humans merely as means so most deontologists should agree with the assessment.

You can see it as a more complex formulation of Philippa Foot's trolley problem. Whatever your intuition in that thought experiment, your intuition ought to be similar here.

If there are any issues, the company you made a deal with needs to fix it and then they get to deal with their shitty subcontractors themselves.

I built a kitchen some years back and the kitchen designer had a foreign firm make and deliver the counter slabs. The slabs weren't delivered to the agreed upon address (rather some 20km away) and were broken upon unpacking. The kitchen designer tried to tell us we have to deal with the foreign company and that they have no responsibility. The foreign firm didn't want to pay shit (because we had to transport them to the building site ourselves before unpacking them), and eventually we just deducted the extra costs of getting new slabs from the kitchen designer's bill. They know the law is on our side so they won't take it to court.

But for all I know maybe /u/bleunt is just naive and uninformed.

Regardless, there's a fairly large consensus on pollution constituting a harm. The difficulty is in quantifying that harm (see e.g. the writings of John Broome)."

Do you mean that they should call themselves such because of the geographical area they occupy or because the naming also involves some claim to a historical culture? Because the former is probably how the naming originated, and seems quite easy to defend while the latter appears much more difficult to defend. However, the former doesn't really convey itself to arguing for the return of artifacts."

For most of our history, Egypt has been like the national counterpart to London or New York, which is really impressive, but with all that increased trade, warfare and infrastructural development also comes displacement and migration.

The islands around Scotland have only had a few mass migrations and the Sami people in Lapland are one of the few actually indigenous peoples of Europe (IIRC the only other being Basque) that were pushed there as a result of other people migrating around.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fdsgq98,t1_fdscumv,1578702405.0,"I agree. Both my parents are/were museum curators, and it's a fairly complex diplomatic situation.

It often flares up if artifacts from country A are being sent to an exhibition in country B but are claimed by country C. Country A wants (typically) national insurance from country B that the artifacts won't be sent to country C while country C will pressure B to give them up. Obviously, there's a lot more agents involved since a lot of exhibitions are operated by museums that aren't directly state-run etc., but this Reddit thread is massively simplifying the complexity of the issue. And everything I've written is descriptive without even touching normative claims, which are very difficult to substantiate.

It's also ignoring the massive amounts of artifacts that were excavated and sold by private people long before states had interest or resources to commit to such efforts (in many cases before the current state even existed). In other cases the state might actually have sold off historical artifacts and later wanted to claim them back. If an object has been in a private collection since the mid-1800s and someone just bought it from an auction house or art dealer it somewhat diminishes a modern state's claim to the object. At the very least it muddles the waters of ownership."

Before I dig myself any deeper into the hole I want to say that it obviously seems intuitively wrong on every level to do this, but don't crustaceans rank extremely low on consciousness charts?

todayilearned,fdsejf9,t1_fds9q3e,1578700884.0,"You are probably right in a sense, but I can't help but think of cows and similar animals.

If we discount the quality of an animals' life (which might of course be better in captivity than in nature, but that's a different discussion) and only assign value to how many animals there are of a species, then the demand for dead animals of that species will provide an incentive to keep the populations high.

In other words, if we stopped eating beef and using cow leather, cattle populations would dwindle massively because currently the demand for cow-based products is very high.

Outside of work animals, the instrumental value of a single species is typically quite low (with some exceptions that might be necessary for the ecosystem). Thus, if there is no demand for a dead animal of some species, the incentive to keep that species around is moved from industry to things like zoos and non-profits which, evidently, is much less efficient.

However, this might not really apply in all circumstances, e.g. with animals that are difficult to breed in captivity or in other cases that incentivise poaching."

I have an acquaintance who drove through a reindeer with a motorbike, but that's obviously much more dangerous than being in a car. Doubt the same is possible with regards to larger mammals though.

Elk have such tall legs that they come through the windshield which, when considering their higher relative mass, makes them much more dangerous. You can also bet on passing elk behind them, whereas reindeer are much less predictable, significantly more stupid and typically enjoy walking on the road.

Tl;dr: Swerving off the road is probably more dangerous than hitting reindeer."
