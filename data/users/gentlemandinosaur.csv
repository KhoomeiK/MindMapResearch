OutOfTheLoop,ffitbhw,t1_ffi4dgv,1579982196.0,"I told you. The data is there. I have proven my assertions with sources. 

You have to rebut objectively without the apparent implicit bias you are currently showing.

Also, I posted multiple studies and in addition to not knowing what anecdotal means you don’t know what “spam” means either. Since posting it twice is not by any definition “spam”.

“People” aren’t telling me anything is “bullshit”. But, you. You have this whole narrative just made up in your mind. 

Why even bother replying dude? You obviously cannot be objective. You only want to deny any conclusion that doesn’t fit your narrative. This data isn’t for you. It’s for people that don’t have implicit bias. Just think you are right, and move on. It’s easier for you that way."

How would you know, since there is no way you could have read though those abstracts before responding. 

Also, I would recommend looking up the definition of “anecdotal”, and trying to understand how the scientific method actually works"

How did she backstab? Do you have proof that this supposed conversation didn’t happen between them? 

I have no proof it did. He said it didn’t. She said it did. 

So, it’s a wash. 

Are (assuming since not American) Europeans have such a petty view of people that they get hung up on some minor, non-provable he said/she said... that they cannot look at the important things like political policies and how a person would do in a job. 

She is an a doctor of economics. She has actual, viable policies, and doesn’t come across as just an idealist. She has enough character to admit she is wrong (she changed political parties from Republican to Democrat because she researched and proved herself wrong). 

She developed the blueprint for the entire economics department under Obama. 

She is an objectively good candidate. 

Please explain how she is “dangerous”?"

OutOfTheLoop,ffi030h,t1_ffhghit,1579960922.0,"I disagree. The issue I have with that is that it’s forced neutrality. Which is not the same as objectivity. 

Sometimes there isn’t a “other side of the coin”.

Some things are just right or wrong. Objectively, morally, rationally, and logically. 

For a horrible example: Sexually abusing infants doesn’t have a “fair and balanced” methodology. There is a right side “don’t sexually abuse infants” and a wrong side “sexually abuse infants”. That’s it. End of discussion. 

Yes, a bit of an appeal to emotions, I apologize. But, my point is that forcing some kind of “neutral” position without actual objectivity is just as bad as a extreme position to any side. 

And Rogan has this aire of “I am woke as fuck because I follow this path of neutrality”.  And I DO believe that giving airtime to people with extreme positions is dangerous, and it does validate them. 

And just like John Stewart, and John Oliver and Trevor Noah (whom I all enjoy very much) have this sense of validation and whose opinions are taken seriously, but then when called out on shit go to “I’m a comedian and this is entertainment” is bullshit. 

You cannot have your cake and eat it to. If your fan base takes you at face value and trusts your political opinion... then you are a pundit. You cannot then turn around and pretend you are “just an entertainer” when it’s convenient. 

And the Alex Jones thing may have been entertaining... Rogans show has grown beyond just “being entertaining”. He has a responsibility now to not promote dangerous, and extreme views to his arguably young and primarily immature/impressionable fan base. 

And that’s not an insult. His primary demo is 16-24. He has a responsibility. And that is why I don’t like his show. He falls into the “wake up sheeple” crowd of people pretending to be objective while actually being a zealot for neutrality at any cost.

I am sure that I will get downvoted to oblivion... but, I thought I would just voice my opinion in response to your concise, and well put opinion."

Really objectively Biden has the “best chance” of beating Trump according to all the numbers. 

And I say this as someone that loathes to vote for him. I definitely am either voting for Bernie or Warren in the Primary. 

And then will have to vote for whomever wins the primary."
OutOfTheLoop,ffhym2b,t1_fffztfa,1579959428.0,Where did you get this statistic? I cannot find a real source.
OutOfTheLoop,ffhy97m,t1_fffq5dx,1579959051.0,"My problem is that he gives a voice to conspiracy theorists, and fake history, and all kinds of things that shouldn’t be promoted in any way. 

The idea that “everything has two sides to it” is objectively false. 

SOME things don’t have two sides. Some things are either true or definitively false. And are dangerous to even promote.

I get the appeal of “balanced perspective”. But, it’s not actual objectively. It’s forced neutrality, which is in itself irrational. Objectivity is about taking information and making the most rational decision as logically and pragmatically as possible. And forcing a “second side” to some things is the opposite of that. It’s just as bad as extremism to one side or another."
