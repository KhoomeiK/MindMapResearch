RedLetterMedia,fgjq098,t3_d4p8hs,1580849121.0,"I just finished watching it again. I'm pretty picky with most movies and my movie collection is therefore relatively small. My opinion is this:         
The movie starts with an opening that has a lot of jokes that don't land. There's the voice-over opening where the dad is trying to decide how to start the movie. It's very ""auntie humor."" It's the kind of joke I'd have made when I was doing stick-figure animations in my teenage years. The animation has ten times more work put into it than the writing in this scene.        
Next, Chicken Little rings the bell, which properly sets up the conflict for most of the movie, both between Chicken Little and his father, and between the town's people and the aliens, but the opening is full of lame visual humor:           
1. The mother pulls her many children out of a single carriage. It's just the ol ""rabbits breed a lot"" joke. It's not really funny.         
2. The dogs run out of a shop and one stops to bury a bone. The whole way it's presented is just lame. It doesn't work.        
There's a few more visual gags, and they're just lame.        

Then the story starts, and there's some pretty good directing in the way the dialogue between the characters overlaps, but again we get a pretty stupid visual joke with a stork repeatedly slamming into a glass window.        
Then the music cuts in as Chicken Little misses the bus, and we get a pretty excellent sequence of him demonstrating how innovative he is in trying to get to school. *This* scene is basically the heart of the movie, what makes it even as good as it is, and it's the kind of thing that has me rewatching the movie over and over.         
Then it goes to the scene where they're playing dodgeball, which isn't perfect, but has some excellent little moments peppered throughout. I kind of like the part where they call a timeout and immediately everyone starts talking on their cellphones.        

The baseball training montage is again, just like the title sequence, a fun, energetic moment. You really get a sense of all the characters throughout.       

And then my favorite scene in the whole movie. The baseball pennant. If you haven't recently, watch that scene again. The announcer's dialogue and the way he delivers it is *spot on.* I couldn't have asked for a better, more energetic, more hilarious sequence. This one scene is worth the admission price.       

After that point, the rest of the movie is pretty good, with humor that's funny (and lame jokes that don't work peppered throughout) good character interaction and fun sequences. 

Overall, I think the good outweighs the bad, but if I could recut this movie, I'd remove a good 40% of the attempts at jokes and I think it would be received much better."

As a corollary, I'm reading *the Dresden Files* series right now, and I'm noticing that Dresden tends to describe what women characters look like more than male characters. How much he describes the character is based upon the following things:        
1. How long the character will be in the story.        
2. How sexually or romantically attracted the main character is to this character.     
3. How important this character's appearance is, whether to the character herself (E.G., she's trying to manipulate you with her legs) or to the main character (E.G., he has to keep checking his libido.)

""AVOID ALL DESCRIPTION"" is quite extreme.
Descriptions of setting are required to become immersed in the story and visualize what's happening.        
You don't have to give a complete analysis of what's on the shelves and the desk and exactly how high the ceiling is and what the dimensions of the chest in the back of the room are. But at least a general idea is useful. There are ways to briefly describe settings in a way that allows the reader to visualize. You don't necessarily have to turn it up to 11.      
Descriptions of characters are less vital but can be used in a concise yet effective manner as well, if he's set on avoiding being very descriptive.
I suppose there are levels here.       
""Mary was wearing a blue coat, a purple scarf with matching mittens, and a cute pink beanie on top of her chocolate-brown hair."" Pretty descriptive, it's what I'd call ""fluffy."" Not necessarily bad, but not everyone's cup of tea, either.

[Look at this excerpt \(in the form of a screen-capture.\)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/495619022944206849/673225889370079262/unknown.png)         

For whatever reason, I am *enthralled* by this writing. It's not in a genre I'd typically read, it's not in a style in which I'd typically write, it's a quite long paragraph and is filled with information about various characters and their finances and such.        
Why on *earth* should I enjoy reading this? Why should it hold my attention?         
Yet, it does. No clue what's up with that.      
I guess I have to assume it's because, as long as the excerpt is, it's sort of constantly moving, and the explanation is toward an end: The family is well-to-do, but with no money saved and many daughters, it's fortunate that a handsome, reputable, educated and wealthy man would come to them and want to marry their daughter.          
I guess there's a sort of. . . tension with it, because such good fortunate rarely comes without problems of its own."
writing,fg6ygvf,t3_ewp1uw,1580579800.0,"I think most fiction stories are more or less libertarian, which is closer to *modern* right-wing than *modern* left-wing progressiveness, generally speaking, because left-wing progressive ideology basically requires government intervention to police speech, jokes, flags, statues, *et cetera*.        
I imagine it'd be tough to write an interesting story about grand adventure and thought-diverse characters, while simultaneously making them all live in a world rigidly defined by progressive ideals that necessitate constant government intervention in people's daily lives.
