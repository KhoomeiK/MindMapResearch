It makes for great roleplaying opportunities, like when we brought our super-weapon out to use against what we thought was the BBEG. We held the BBEG off for a few rounds while it charged, then we activated it and... nothing. It failed to work.

As we reeled in shock, an NPC wizard was preparing to get us out. The DM (in character as the NPC wizard) told his wife (a sorceress) that she needed to get to him and he didn't have time to explain. She interrupted him saying ""Neither do I. Disintegrate!"" She zapped the BBEG with a level six spell, interrupting the BBEG's attempt to one shot the group (which he ABSOLUTELY could have done). We were level 8. Sorcerers don't get level six spells until level 12.

In retaliation, the BBEG focused his attack on her, killing her as we escaped. She brought in her next character and revealed that her old one was becoming a super powerful NPC, as she finally understood something from her backstory. Something that unlocked the power to defy death and gain epic level spellcasting, lost since a time so long ago that it was ancient when our world was new.

She became the BBEG of our sequel campaign."

Remember how it took us over 100 years to formally recognize the Armenian Genocide? We didn't want to piss off Armenia for admitting that their great great grandparents were guilty of something.

At first, they noticed that there was a slight change in the brain activity *before* the subject had actually decided to tap their fingers. They thought this meant that the brain decided to move your fingers, and then you ""decided"" to move your fingers- thus your decisions were not your own and free will was false.

Then in 2012, French scientists looked at that data in a different way. What if that change in brain activity was because of something else? Perhaps it was naturally easier to tap your fingers during that change?

They redid the test in a way that checked brain activity both during random tapping and while not moving. They were able to determine that, sometimes, your brain has a change in its activity exactly when you decide to do something- and that means you're in charge! The Bereitschaftspotential (the German's word for that specific change in your brain) was not evidence that you have no free will. It was just brain noise that only happens in a very specific situation. All further tests have confirmed that your decisions are not made for you- you make them!

Pathfinder has a short campaign called ""We Be Goblins"" that has some information that really helps you get into the mindset of a goblin. After a long, hard day of beating chained horses to death and stealing from a travelling saleswoman's cart and eating half a banana that you found in the garbage, what better to do than to lick a hallucinogenic toad and crash a halfling wedding?

It's a really fun one-shot type deal (but they expanded it into three adventures plus a prequel). The first book has the players following a map to a shipwreck so they can find a crate of fireworks because FUCK YEAH FIREWORKS LET'S BLOW SOME SHIT UP! They don't need any ""the world is dying"" type motivation. They don't care about it. They don't care about strategy. They provoke attacks of opportunity. They do nonlethal damage just to hurt you. They try to trip you just for laughs. Actually killing you isn't high on their list of priorities! And that's what makes goblins easier targets than their attack bonus and armor class might suggest."

It' was really nice to see how strong we had become."

Hundreds of miles on a planet that is almost 200 *million* square miles isn't really that big a deal. Yes, global temperature would be affected and a lot of plants, animals, and people would die, but not all. The radiation would barely even be a blip on the global scale. The areas around the explosions would be uninhabitable for a long time- but only for humans. Animals adapt really quickly. Plants even more so.

What would end is our way of life. It would take decades or more to rebuild. If this happens, maybe we can do better on round two."

dndmemes,fdg09bw,t1_fdfehk5,1578375384.0,"My DM has done this. We have a situation where the goal isn't to kill the monster, but to delay it or get past it.

For example, around level 6, we went into a high level dungeon. At the bottom was an ancient dragon, CR 22. One player (a dragonborn) started talking to it about dragon stuff. I tried to sneak past it while invisible to get the treasure it was guarding. Long story short, that's how I discovered that blindsense was a thing, and somebody else had to get the treasure. One character kept using an ability to ""slow"" the dragon, forcing it to take one attack per turn rather than it's total of six or whatever. It's the only reason we survived, but it became a story worth telling."
dndmemes,fdg03g5,t1_fdfmrrs,1578375231.0,"They can, if you play the goblins like intelligent adversaries. Goblins, however, are actually just little shitheads who are just as likely to get distracted and throw a rock at a dead horse, or to try and set something unimportant on fire as they are to attack the players.

To a goblin, combat isn't about killing their opponents. It's about causing mayhem and having a damn good time doing it. Only when the goblins start dying should their focus switch to ""oh shit we should probably kill these guys."""
