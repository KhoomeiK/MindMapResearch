The idea is cool, but maybe it would be better with less  questions and focusing on different colours, rather than using 2-3 shades of the same (answer) colour."

QuantumComputing,fejebt4,t1_fegq4hg,1579169924.0,To be honest the actual physics is usually an overkill compared to what most people want to do with QC
QuantumComputing,feje81i,t1_feiar5m,1579169769.0,"Well the whole thing about Pauli matrices, rotations and bra ket is usually covered in a quantum mechanics course, while other stuff like bloch spheres, density matrices, algorithms and such is covered usually in any quantum information/computation course. I agree there's no single course covering everything, but that's just because explaining the whole quantum mechanic thing and then quantum computing and information, with in-depth explanations, would be way too much for a course.

With microwaves I guess you're referring to the article posted here a few days ago about using microwaves to reduce errors, which I think is something you would do as an experimental solid state physicist/engineer working on the hardware side (so you don't really need to know much about algorithms and QC yourself). Here I really can't tell as I've never seen it covered in any course, but I guess that's something you see as an experimentalist.

Edit: also, I would like to mention that ""Start to finish"" courses are something found within established fields that have a solid industry behind, which QC is not. QC is still in its infancy and most of the jobs are on the research side and require a phd. There are developers roles, but not nearly enough and you don't actually need QC at all for those (just look at quantum developers job alerts by ibm or google, quantum mechanics knowledge is not even required).

Edit 2: also, the book I suggested covers most of the things you mentioned, with a kind of ""start to finish"" approach since as far as I remember doesn't require prior quantum mechanics knowledge (not exestinve at least), but just the basic linear algebra knowledge."
QuantumComputing,fei7ub7,t3_ep27ui,1579132221.0,"As a physicist I can tell you that all of these topics are covered in any quantum information or computation course I have seen. I guess the courses you refer to are meant to be taken by computer scientist (to be honest, you don't need to know too much about the physics behind QC to use the IBMQ qiskit framework). You can find a good introduction to the mathematics behind and the theory of quantum circuits (4th chapter, I think) and computation in the book ""Quantum computation and Quantum information"" by Nielsen and Chuang (10 years edition).

When talking about the histogram, are you referring to the ones showing on the IBMQ tool? From what I've seen, that histogram just shows the coefficients of your qubits state when expanded in the basis states."

I have no idea how a research career in the industry would look like, since I've only experienced research in the academia, but I guess a phd and some post-doc experience would be required.

If I may, what's your job?"
QuantumComputing,fddyawq,t1_fdc3omd,1578326921.0,"I'm sorry as I'm afraid to have badly phrased my answer.

As in my post, I'm already aware of the issues you mentioned, especially because in my master's thesis I worked on the markovianity (which involves complete positivity in the presence of an environment) of quantum dynamical maps. That's exactly the kind of topics I'm not too interested into, as I'm not looking for a career in research but for something more technical and more CS oriented, like SW or algorithm optimization but focused on quantum tech.

My questions arised because I noticed some openings in companies for development of libraries to simulate quantum circuits or stuff like quantum annealing for finance and such. Some companies are offering quantum technologies in cloud for industry and finance clients, and that's what I would be mostly interested into."

But I don't know how much quantum physics skills are required in either of these and where to get the necessary skills apart from self study."
