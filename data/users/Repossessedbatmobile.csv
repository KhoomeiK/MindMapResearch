I've seen some people become downright nasty for no reason while playing harmless games, so nothing surprises me anymore. It's sad when people do that, but at least it lets you know to avoid them. It's always better to just try to enjoy a game rather than do stuff like that.

Whenever I realize I'm doing it, I try to stop myself and instead ask the other person questions about what they previously showed interest in talking about before I started going on and on, then I do my best to listen and engage with them about what they're interested in. I grew up in a family that was all about one-upping each other conversationally. It felt like everyone was competing to be heard, and whoever could talk over everyone else for the longest time was the winner. In high school it was pointed out to me that I did that too, and I felt horrible about it because I knew how it felt to have people talk over you and not listen. So I made it my mission to try and get better at listening to others and breaking my bad conversation habits. It's still a learning process for me, and I'm not always great at catching myself, but I'm getting better at stopping myself once I realize I'm doing and focusing on the other person instead."
tifu,ffo82eq,t1_ffm9peq,1580075033.0,"Warm/hot water does mess with blood pressure, it's especially worse if you already have blood flow issues. I have POTS, as well as a few other health conditions, and a warm/hot shower always makes me feel like I'm about to collapse. I actually passed out a several times as a kid and teen while showering just because I didn't know I had these issues back then and turned the water too hot. Now I can only stay upright if I shower in lukewarm or tepid water. If I want it warmer than that, I have to use a shower chair to avoid passing out, and afterwards I usually feel exhausted anyway. It's kind of frustrating that what is supposed to be a refreshing shower for most people often feels so exhausting for me. But with warm water and blood flow issues there's not much that can be done except to take meds, use a shower chair, and hope for the best."

I told my doctor I thought I had EDS because I saw a documentary on it and noticed that I matched all the symptoms, but he refused to even consider testing me because he assumed I was wrong since I wasn't a expert and said there was no way I could have it because it is so rare. I told him I refused to leave the office unless he ordered the test, and after complaining about patients googling symptoms and accusing me of being ignorant, he gave me the name of another doctor who could test for it. Turned out I was right. The tests revealed I do have EDS, in addition to POTS. Both of which my old doctor totally missed, even though I have been experiencing obvious symptoms for years and am open about my health problems. Some doctors are just ignorant about rare medical conditions. But a doctor should always listen to their patient and take them seriously, even if they don't agree with them, because the patient is the one experiencing the symptoms and the only way to properly diagnose someone's medical issues is to take their symptoms seriously."

I've also known other people who had eye color inheritance that didn't match the chart. A old friend from high school had green eyes that were so pale they looked yellow, while the rest of their family all had dark brown eyes, except for one of his grandparents who had pale green-yellow eyes just like him.

MadeMeSmile,ff7pjic,t3_es00cm,1579655220.0,"I will always love and appreciate the people who make these videos. I occasionally experience audio processing issues, so it sometimes takes me a little while to properly process new information, especially if it's something I'm not familiar with. As a result, I often ask questions to clarify what I hear or ask people to repeat things because my ears might not have picked it up properly. I know this can test a lot of people's patience, so I don't typically ask for help with things unless it's from someone who knows me very well and is understanding of my audio issues. Because of this, I often rely on videos like these to teach myself skills that I need to learn. I've found that these kinds of videos are an INCREDIBLE learning tool for someone like me simply because I can pause them if my ears need a extra moment to properly process the sound, I can replay them as much as I need to, I can take notes, I can make them louder or softer depending on what I need to hear best at that moment, and I can even use subtitles to bypass having to listen altogether! My ability to process sound may be finicky sometimes, but I can always watch a video until I fully understand it. So these videos give me the ability to learn new skills without having to worry about my sound processing issues. These kinds of videos might not seem special to most people, but they have helped me so much to learn so many things, so they will always have a special place in my heart. Because of that, I am so thankful that videos like this exist, and I will always be thankful to the people who make them."

Two dogs tried to attack us on two separate occasions (one while out on a walk, another while he was resting under my chair in the outdoor area of a local restaurant). With both incidents, his entire response was to just stand up and calmly move away from the other dog to avoid it. Thankfully they were both much smaller than him, so they couldn't do much to reach him once he stood up. But it was frustrating when one of the owners yelled at me for having a ""dangerous animal that provoked her dog"". In reality my boy was just laying calmly under my chair relaxing when her dog jumped out of her arms and ran over to lunge at him. But she tried to blame him, as if it was his fault that she couldn't control her own dog.

Another time, he was called a ""weapon"" by a parent because she assumed he would attack her child. Meanwhile, her toddler was actually repeatedly trying to hit my dog with a toy, while my dog just backed up a bit to avoid the toy and then stood there totally ignoring the child. If anything, the CHILD was more of a weapon than my dog, because the child was the one trying to actively hit another living being, while my dog was just standing there. My boy's not a weapon. If anything, he's a pacifist with fur.

AskReddit,fejzkln,t3_epfjje,1579189408.0,"I used to have a massive cyst that was wrapped tightly around my right ovary like a octopus. Used to. Then one day it suddenly decided to explode inside of me. Never felt pain like that before, and I'm a disabled person who literally lives in chronic pain and is used to random bone and joint dislocations, intense body pains, and muscle rips due to my medical issues. But the pain of those seems soooo miniscule in comparison to the pain I felt when my cyst exploded. When it happened I thought I was going to die. I had to be hooked up to meds and monitored closely for over 24 hours at the ER just to make sure I wasn't going into shock because of how much trauma the eruption had caused to my ovary and all the surrounding organs. Thankfully I ended up not needing surgery and they told me that the tissue from the cyst would be reabsorbed into my body, but they still had to make sure that I didn't succumb to and die of shock. I'll never forget how that pain felt. I've had broken bones, sprains, total bone dislocations, my joints slipping out of place, organs shift, muscle rips and tears, salmonella poisoning, once almost drowned and had to be resuscitated, sometimes can't move due to full body pain flare ups, and my immune system once literally tried to kill me and left me unable to use my limbs for almost a year (I had to relearn how to walk, write and draw, balance, etc). But NONE of that can compare to how much agony I felt when that cyst exploded. I consider myself a pretty tough cookie, especially considering most of the things I've been through.

aww,fejan5a,t1_feirvwf,1579164390.0,"Thank you. I try to be understanding of first time owners, as well as owners who love their pets but may not be aware of something. When I was a kid and my family got our first dog, it was a german shepherd puppy who had a small hernia on her belly. They noticed it quickly when they got her from the breeder, and when they asked the breeder about it, they were told it was a belly button and that she was fine. Well, that breeder either made a mistake or lied to them. Thankfully the vet caught the hernia right away and it was able to be repaired. But if it hadn't been caught and fixed, it could have caused major health issues. After the hernia was fixed, she went on to live a long, happy life in good health. Lots of first time dog owners are like my parents. They're not bad people, they just didn't know everything or may have been given misinformation. In my parent's case, as soon as they learned the truth about our first dog's medical issue, they quickly educated themselves about it and made sure she received the proper vet care she needed to help her. And as a result she was able to stay happy and healthy, and lived a long life alongside her two future doggy siblings, both of who were rescues. Many dog owners aren't bad people. Sometimes, like my parents, they were just given bad information and need to learn the truth. But as long as they love their pet, and are willing to give them the proper care they need to be happy and healthy, that's all that matters.

LateStageCapitalism,feda38q,t3_eog1k5,1579005292.0,"This is why I hate USA healthcare so much. I have good insurance, and am disabled with EDS and POTS. Yesterday at my specialist, I brought up getting a electric wheelchair, and asked how it could be covered by insurance. My doctor, who is usually pretty good about listening to me and taking me seriously, got sooooo uncomfortable and tried to totally avoid even discussing it. He kept changing the topic, saying that he wanted to try other alternatives, that he didn't want me relying on it, that he's rather I try medications first, that I didn't need it, that we should discuss other things I need, etc. Finally everything I'd been going through got to me (my medical conditions are incurable, progressive, and get worse over time - and lately they've been getting much more severe), and for the first time in many months I actually started to cry as I told him that even thought I can walk a bit on my good days, on my bad days I have to use two canes just to get up out of bed. I told him how on my bad days, I often can't use my legs at all, and collapse when just trying to stand or walk, even when using both my canes to support myself. I told him why a electric wheelchair mattered so much to me, because on the days that I can't use my legs at all, I can't walk my service dog in training or leave my apartment at all because I can't move or use my legs at all. And how despite my service dog in training being housebroken and alerting me that he had to go potty by placing his paw on the door handle several days prior, I was physically unable to walk at that day that could not take him out no matter how hard I tried to move. He ended up eventually having an accident because of it, and I could tell we both felt horrible about it. My dog knew it was wrong, and I could tell he felt bad about doing it. And I felt like I had failed my dog because at that moment I was not physically capable of even using my legs to take him outside. I told my doctor how I had to basically crawl on the floor to clean up after him at that moment, and how horrible it felt to have to go through that. I also told him that I don't want to be in a wheelchair 24/7 because I can walk on my good days, but for me on the bad days an electric wheelchair would give me the ability to get out of my apartment and walk my dog, and basically function as a human being. My doctor finally just sighed and said ""It's almost impossible to get those covered by insurance, so I don't want to start with it. But I'll consider it, and I get what you're saying. Let's just start with the other stuff first, and then we'll discuss it at your next appointment.""

I know that it wasn't a win, but it wasn't a loss either, so I accepted it since it seems he at least understands my situation and why a electric wheelchair would benefit me so much. But the fact that he really wanted to avoid the possibility of me getting one because of how difficult insurance is, is so freaking messed up. Medical devices like prosthetics, wheelchairs, scooters, etc. - they're not just wanted. They're NEEDED so that disabled people can live independently and basically function as people. And yet insurance does everything they can to basically stop us from being able to get them! In the United States, we don't have healthcare. We have wealthcare. Because if you're not wealthy enough to pay the ridiculously overpriced cost things out of pocket (since god knows insurance does everything they can to avoid paying for things), then you are screwed. And if you're a disabled person who needs mobility aids or devices to function, then you're usually doubly screwed. But no matter who you are, USA healthcare tries to screw you over and throw you under the bus. The only difference is that if you're disabled or have severe medical issues, they throw you under the bus faster.

aww,fed5p2x,t1_feamtzp,1579000145.0,"Unfixed poorly behaved dogs are the reason I stopped taking my dog to the park. I have a neutered male who basically assumes that everyone exists to be his best friend is is a super happy, laid back fellow. Unfortunately his sweet, easygoing disposition was put to the test a few times at two different dog parks when at the first park a very large unfixed malamute (who was about 3 times the size of my medium sized dog) tried to repeatedly corner him and mount him. My dog, bless him, only responded by rolling out from under it and using his aussie-mix agility to run away and avoid it as best as possible. But the malamute was relentless, and I kept asking the owner to stop her dog as I tried to keep it away from my boy by standing between them to block it. When he yelped from the pressure of a dog 3 times his size trying to mount him, I lost my cool and snapped at her to ""JUST DO SOMETHING TO STOP YOUR DOG ALREADY!"" She just looked at me and shrugged saying ""he's not fixed because I want to breed him. He only does it to unfixed females, so it's just because yours is a girl."" At that point I was really pissed off on behalf of my dog and told her, ""HE is a neutered male, who is obviously a lot more well behaved than your unfixed monstrosity"". Thank goodness the other park goers knew me and my dog, because after she tried to blame me for everything, they took my side and asked her to leave if she couldn't control her dog.   
The second incident - WARNING, THIS STORY IS VIOLENT - took place with another unfixed male who tried to repeatedly corner my dog to bite at him, and then tried to kill him. The owner's just stood back and did nothing as it kept charging at him over and over again biting near his neck and chest, while my dog used his agility avoid it as best he could, and just play with the other dogs that were there. I repeatedly moved to block it's access to him because I could tell it was highly aggresive. When I told its owners to control their dog, they just laughed and said it was trying to play. Then it managed to get past me and grabbed hold of my dog's neck. Thank god that my aussie-mix is super fluffy, because it mostly got his fur, and thankfully my boy was able to break free and flip himself around the dog to run away quickly, leaving the attacking dog standing there with a chunk of his neck fur in it's mouth. The unfixed male then tried to rush forward again to grab his neck again, this time closer to his jugular. I was only able to stop it by kicking it HARD on it's back thigh to make it let go, and then shoving myself forward to protect my dog as a living shield. At THAT point the owners finally stepped in to grab their dog, and as they held it, it was still trying to break free of their grasps to lunge at me and my dog as it snarled. I think they only stopped it because they knew it would attack Me if they didn't, because they obviously didn't care if it attacked another dog. After that the other dog park goers demanded that the owners of the aggressive dog leave the park with their dog. They later told me that my dog wasn't the first dog it had tried to mess with, and that they knew my dog and knew he was just a victim. It was a terrifying experience that left me very shaken, and left my dog with a few shallow scrapes that healed well with vet care. 

Sadly, a week later, I got a text from a friend who also liked to go to that same dog park. She told me that the very same dog who had viciously attacked my boy had apparently KILLED two other dogs just a few days after attacking my boy, at the very same park. It had killed a tiny Shih Tzu in the parking lot next to the dog park, as well as an elderly Labrador inside the dog park. Apparently, again, the owners did nothing to stop it, and the police ended up getting involved and seized the dog. After hearing that, I realized that my dog and I were both lucky to have both survived the interaction relatively unscathed. After that happened, I can no longer trust that any dog is safe at a dog park. 

Amazingly, none of this seemed to effect my dog's personality at all. He's still very happy, easy going, and chill, still loves other dogs and people, and is still pretty friendly with everyone he meets.

She tried regular wigs, but hated wearing them because she could tell that it didn't look natural when she looked in the mirror. When she got her custom piece, it looked exactly like her hair did before chemo, and as soon as she put it on she was so happy because it looked like she had her hair back. When the chemo was finally done and she was declared cancer free, she was still pretty bald so she wore it every day. She said it was very expensive, but was the best money she spent because it made her feel pretty at a time when she was at her most vulnerable. Eventually, a few years after getting chemo, her hair slowly started to grow back as odd textured baby fuzz. She continued to wear the wig as the hair slowly regrew. Now, several years later, she still cancer free and no longer has to wear the wig because her natural hair has grown back to be as long as the wig. She may not need the wig anymore, but she's still thankful she bought it years ago and considers it money well spent. These wigs are pricey, complicated to make, and require ongoing care including washing, styling, combing, and storing the right way so they continue to look good. But for the people who need them most, they are a god-send. I'm happy for the guy who got one and hope it brings him happiness, just like it did for my mom when she needed it most."
service_dogs,fe6sx70,t3_eo0bjc,1578903891.0,"I have the exact same issues as you (EDS, POTS, tremors/mini seizures, and adrenaline surges that occasionally cause anxiety, sensory issues, etc). Honestly, with how complex these issues are, your best bet would probably be to get a dog from a program. That way it would be custom trained to help you, and you would not have to worry about doing any of the training yourself so you can focus on your health and wellbeing while someone else trains the dog for you. If you have severe health issues and do not have a ton of experience with advanced dog training, then a organization is your best bet. I say this as someone who self-trained my own service dog. The only reason I was able to self-train was because I was literally a dog trainer before my medical issues became more progressive, so I was able to use my past 10 years of advanced dog training experience to train my own dog to do assistance tasks and advanced training, despite my physical issues. But honestly, without my years of experience as a dog trainer it probably would have been impossible. Even with over 10 years of advanced dog training experience, self-training still often pushed me beyond my body's limitations and was often extremely difficult both physically, mentally, and pain-wise. I don't want to be discouraging, but training a service dog to assist a physical disability is A LOT different than training a purely psychiatric service dog simply because the level of our physical limitations, as well as the experience, time, and ongoing effort needed to train advanced physical tasks that are often very difficult for even the smartest dogs to master. My own dog is still in training because he still has a few more tasks he needs to learn, but a good example of some of his tasks that he can already do is to get my cane for me, do medical alerts for POTS and EDS flare ups and dislocations, get the lights, close drawers, retrieve objects I point to, and carry objects for me. Just one of these tasks often takes me many Months to fully teach him, despite my years of experience and knowledge of advanced dog training. The medical alert training took over a year for him to get it. And him retrieving specific objects like my cane took many months to train. This involved working with him multiple times a day, every single day, and not just on task work. In addition to task work, I also had to do ongoing public access and advanced obedience training, because I know that if he pulls me even slightly I can easily fall and get injured. And trust me when I say that it took many, many, many ongoing months of training for him to finally learn how to properly walk so he never accidentally pulls me. I'm not trying to put a damper on things for you. I just want to paint a realistic picture for you because I have the unique experience of being in your shoes, medically speaking. But in addition to that, I also have my past experience as a dog trainer for 10 years. Honestly, without my past 10 years of experience as a dog trainer, I probably could never have done this. It's would have simply been too much for me to physically handle. And I worry that without years of advanced dog training experience to default to, as well as how these health issues are progressive and will effect continue to effect us more severely over time, training your own service dog may simply be too much for you to put on your shoulders. There is nothing wrong with choosing to get a dog from a organization. They will make sure that it is trained properly and do all the hard work so that you do not have to. In addition to that, they will pair you up with a dog who's temperament, personality, and size will work well with you and your health issues. And they will customize the training and tasks so that it will work well for you specifically and meet the unique needs of your disabilities. So I hope you understand why I think that an organization would probably be the best fit for you. They will be able to make sure that you get a dog that will fit your needs so you won't have to worry about it, and that way you can focus on taking care of yourself.

Before then I was mostly just considering it, but figured I would start training some tasks at home early just in case my medical issues were flaring up and I assistance while at home. Fast forward, and what my doctors and specialists predicted is true. My health issues are indeed progressing in some severe ways that impact how I move and function. So now I'm actually happy I started my SDIT's training before I got to this point. By now I have my SDIT has already learned many tasks to assist me, including carrying objects for me, retrieving dropped objects, fetching specific objects like my cane for me, helping me stand up, and doing medical alerts for POTS and EDS flare ups and bone/joint dislocations. I'm thankful to have my SDIT, but I'm also realistic that I'm going to have to continue with my doctors, specialists, and physical therapists to try and stay as healthy as I can, despite my medical issues. And I also made a bank account to put aside money in advance to care for my dog and cover any ongoing care or vet bills that may occur. I tried to plan everything so I'll never have to worry about whether or not I can afford to see my doctors, as well as take care of all my dog's needs. And because this careful planning took me a while to do, I actually had to hold off on starting my dog's training for a bit. But to me it was worth it because now I know that I don't have to worry about being able to afford my daily expenses, my own medical bills, and my dog's ongoing care. It's never a good idea to just jump in if you don't have your bases covered. Any emergency, both for you or your dog, can suddenly occur.

After going through that, it's easy to see why I don't trust most doctors doing mental health checks on me. They already ignored my physical issues for years and dismissed them as ""anxiety"", ""anger"", ""lady issues"", or ""depression"". Of course I was anxious, angry, and depressed after having my legitimate and severe health issues dismissed for so long and being left to suffer in pain for years. They didn't even care when I lost the ability to walk and use my hands for almost a year due to constant bone and joint dislocations, and accused me of faking my health issues for attention. But that didn't mean I had mental health issues. It just meant they were ignoring my real health problems, which are progressive and get worse over time, and were willing to let me suffer for years due to not taking me seriously. Naturally that would make anyone a bit angry. So you could see why don't exactly trust most doctors to do a mandatory mental health check, especially when they were so willing dismiss my severe physical health problems based on how they interpreted my ""feelings"" and did nothing to help me as my body slowly broke down and I suffered for years.

I'm usually pretty polite and patient when it comes to people asking questions, and will even educate people a bit who are polite or genuinely curious.

I feel like having a service dog for invisible medical conditions it's a constant battle of balancing politeness with refusing to take any BS. On one hand I want to help educate people who are polite enough to respect me and my dog, but on the other hand so many ignorant people have been rude or disruptive when we're just minding our own business that I know I have to stick up for my dog if people try to mess with either him or me. It really is a fine line, but I like to think I balance it okay. I'm never rude to anyone who is genuinely curious and polite, but do my best to maintain my boundaries when it comes to rude people.

Monkeys should NEVER be pets. And forcing a cropped and docked puppy (which is also horrible, and I wish it was outlawed all over) to interact with one is even worse because it creates a situation that is unpredictable, can be potentially harmful for both of them, and is very stressful.

After her mom, her sister, and her niece got diagnosed she wasn't taking any chances, so she and her doctors decided on a double mastectomy and implant replacement, as well as chemo. I have to say, my mom is the kind of person who can shatter a bone and try to walk it off like she's fine (happened with her hip). She's tough as nails when she wants to be, but my goodness, that double mastectomy effected her more than anything I have ever seen before. She's had multiple surgeries before and I never saw her cry from pain, but she was crying from pain after the double mastectomy when she simply tried to shift, move her arms, or just shower. Heck, the mastectomy seemed to effect her more than the rounds of chemo did! Thankfully everything worked out in the end and she's now been cancer free for years. But mastectomies are seriously no joke. They are a very intense surgery with a very lengthy and involved recovery."

""I am healthy! My health problems will get better! I have energy and can walk and move without pain! I can do this!"" ...Basically the stuff I normally tell myself as a disabled person to get myself to do stuff that is really painful or difficult."
aww,fcbilb5,t1_fc9y7x5,1577587304.0,"The dogs they use are often family pets that were stolen to be used for the dog meat festival.  It's one of the reasons that many Koreans are against the dog meat festivals, because their family pets get stolen and killed. This humane society link explains it a bit, as well as how the dogs get treated, but fair warning, some of the images and information are quite graphic.

Showerthoughts,fc4tufl,t3_efpxb9,1577428201.0,"I would just love a cooking show that shows recipes that doesn't require a lot of prep work or physical labor. I'm disabled and have limited physical ability because of it. I can't stand up for long periods, can't cut or chop stuff without accidentally cutting myself, have trouble cleaning things, can't do repetitive movements due to chronic pain, have trouble balancing things like liquids due to shaky hands and weak limbs, and can not lift heavy things without causing myself a lot of pain. I LOVE to cook because I find it really relaxing, but most recipes and cooking videos are a Nightmare for me to attempt. It wouldn't be that hard to make a show that uses stuff like easily available ingredients, pre-chopped things, canned goods, spices and herbs that don't require chopping or cutting, and that you can basically make in less than 30 minutes without moving around a lot. But it seems like most cooking shows want to show ""how easy it is to make complicated dishes"". I don't care how easy it is to make, if I can't physically handle the prep work involved I won't be able to make it. Some people don't have the ability or time to do a lot of prep work for recipes. Why not acknowledge this and make a show focuses on easy but delicious recipes made in ways that work for people with limited time and ability to do things. Everyone deserves to be able to make good food."
