Denver,ffymkww,t1_ffym9kj,1580350005.0,I won’t vote for tax increases that contribute to dependency.  Taxes like this are exactly that.  Coloradans are smart to not vote for taxes that promote government waste.  Don’t like it?  Try California.

A solution that you would approve of is likely one that is way too burdensome on taxpayers and likely won't turn these folks into productive citizens.  Denver is doing the right thing.  You should also see San Francisco, their headed in the direction you're preaching."
Denver,ffxino7,t1_ffxhtjb,1580325909.0,"They aren't harassing him/them ""just for being homeless.""  There's a camping ban in Denver if you haven't noticed.  Trashing public areas with garbage and feces is also a crime, even though you probably don't believe that.   Our legal system should exist to uphold the law.  

His case is without merit, he just knows the city will settle without them doing much else and he'll get his money.  He's done this before, but if you didn't read the actual article, you probably wouldn't know.  

Your last sentence is such an outrageous stretch.... both of these cases are bullshit.  Homeless can ruin public spaces, at the expense of taxpayers, then win lawsuits claiming ""harassment"", also at the expense of taxpayers.  I don't want either of that in my city.  If you want that, move to Portland or Seattle and fuck off."
