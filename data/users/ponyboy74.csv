PoliticalHumor,fffap5k,t1_fff8q7o,1579879792.0,"Yes, matter of fact I posted that very saying here earlier."
PoliticalHumor,fff5sb1,t1_fff4oa4,1579876430.0,"Gun control is needed but you're right.  While they've got people guarding the front door against gun control they're sneaking out the back with their social security,  Medicare and disability.  Among other things."
PoliticalHumor,fff1pxh,t1_fff0t50,1579873292.0,"I hate to be the guy that breaks the news but you can't advance your issue if you don't elect someone from your party first. In a way Democrats,  a lot of us,  seem to be emotionally immature in that it's almost like a tantrum.  ""My guy pushing my issue lost so I'm not voting for anyone "". At least if you vote for the guy who won the primaries,  at least he's got your issue on his list somewhere.  A lot of us seem willing to sacrifice the good if we don't get the best."
PoliticalHumor,ffesrs0,t1_ffer121,1579863794.0,"That's true, but it's also because Democrats fight more for an issue rather than their party.  If the candidate that's pro-their issue loses in the primaries they're more likely not to vote in the general elections.  We don't  rally around our party's candidate the way Republicans do.  If we did we'd be in control even in spite of the other sides gerrymandering.  It's like the saying "" Democrats fall in love, Republicans fall in line""."

nextfuckinglevel,fcdy9rf,t3_egzxhv,1577615065.0,"I used to watch Mike all the time before he became the champ, because he fought all the time. Once a month if memory serves me correctly  or around that much. I loved that. Of course total rounds weren't much but as a long time fight fan I hated the trend to fight less and less often. But, also as a fight fan, I could see he was beatable by a a certain style at a high enough skill level. It was slightly exposed in the James Tillis fight, then Buster did it good enough to beat him. Ali in his prime would have dismantled him. It's all about having the right style at a high enough level."
