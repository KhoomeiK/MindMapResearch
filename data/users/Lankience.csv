Cooking,ff793fw,t3_ermku7,1579643607.0,"It’s more just that they sort of dissolve into whatever sauce you make. The most pantry sauce is all from ingredients that last a long time and I always have on hand.

Lightly cook down some garlic in olive oil for a few seconds and add in tomato paste, cook that out until it turns a deeper red, lower the heat, and add in some chopped anchovy fillets and a few shakes of chili flakes. 

That’s pretty much the sauce, and to finish you add in pasta water to thin it out. Add in your pasta and toss with the sauce until it’s coated and glossy. Grate in a buttload of parm and season with salt to taste. Nothing worse than sauce that doesn’t stick to your pasta."
AskReddit,ff64mo4,t1_ff64h4a,1579619010.0,Yeah I’m 27 now and I’ve long since forgiven myself. Definitely was a moment where I had some understanding of how other people can make that mistake though.
summonerschool,ff62iu0,t1_ff4wat3,1579617498.0,Honestly this never even crossed my mind... going to try this. I kept trying to practice reaching all the way to the control key with my pinky but then I’d be pushing the ability with a different finger anyway and it just didn’t make sense. This makes a lot lore sense.
Cooking,ff6105f,t1_ff559tq,1579616357.0,"Anchovies! I’m not a huge fan of them by themselves but throwing a few fillets into a sauce is a great way to add flavor.

And these lists are a great source of Italian ingredients but I’ve used a lot of other ingredients too. Marmite, bonito flakes, soy sauce, Asian cooking wines, chili oil, green onions, any kind of citrus, etc. Basically anything that will balance whatever flavor I’m trying to level out, or just a way to amplify the umami. Mirin or honey will add some sweetness, soy sauce and marmite will up the umami and saltiness, citrus or vinegar will add some tartness, whatever the dish needs. That’s the beauty of pantry pasta.

I also love throwing greens into pasta once I’ve got a good pantry sauce going. Good way to get more veggies into a meal because they cook down so fast. Personally favorite greens are kale, mustard, and Chinese broccoli."
AskReddit,ff40s7z,t3_eretfd,1579553052.0,"In college my one rule was that I’d never have sex without a condom. After like a 3 year dry spell I had an opportunity and no condom, and did it anyway. Luckily I was friends with the girl anyway and we got plan B and everything worked out, but I was pretty disappointed in myself for that."
AskReddit,ff40hml,t1_ff3uies,1579552867.0,"I do it all the time, both seriously and as a joke. My SO will be hanging out with a group of her friends and there will be like a toxic masculinity reference on tv, or one of them having a bad run-in with a creep, and I’ll just say “the thing about men is, we kind of suck”.

It has never not gotten a huge laugh from the entire group."

AskNYC,fegovqm,t3_eox35i,1579099025.0,"So for what it’s worth, my SO and I lived at 50th and 8th for a year, and recently moved to UES at 77th and York.

The midtown/hells kitchen area has good restaurants on 9th and 10th, but if you ever have to go to 8th ave or any farther east you’ll encounter mobs of people all the time. Honestly we got really tired of fighting through crowds just to get to the subway. Hell’s Kitchen has good stuff for sure, and you’ll be in a great place for it, but there wasn’t anything we really loved that we now miss (except Schmackery’s).

The UES has a lot more to explore than we expected. It also feels like a more permanent area- in that a lot of people up here have lived here a long time, where in midtown people would come and go all the time. People in our building in UES are nice and the whole area feels very welcoming. We’ve got a neighborhood bar we play trivia at and we feel a lot more at home here than we ever did in midtown.

The one thing we wish we could change is we’re a 10-12 min walk to the nearest subway so we wish we could be closer to 2nd. The 70s also don’t have a ton of restaurants so when we go out we usually venture to the 80s. Since neither of those will be an issue for you I think you’ll like it in the UES, that’s just my take. Good luck!"

summonerschool,fe3nsor,t1_fe3jlt5,1578851156.0,"Yeah map awareness is huge, and that’s part of why vision is so important. Taking charge of vision is hugely helpful in low elo, even if you’re in the mid or top lane, if a stray ward in your/enemy jungle can tell your team where their hungover is at any given time, that’s a big advantage that can lead to an objective push or a gank in favor of your team, or can save a lane from over committing and getting handed as a result.

Like if Im mid and get a kill, then I have a few seconds to spare after I push the wave, I’ll usually try to place a ward somewhere in their jungle near raptors, or deep in the river. If their jungle walks through it and we spot them near raptors, our teams jungle knows it’s safe to gank the lane on the opposite side of the map, or go for an objective without fear of the enemy jungler stealing it with smite. Vision and map awareness are huge and go hand in hand."
summonerschool,fe3hb0x,t1_fe2sxeb,1578849265.0,"So I’m no expert, but one thing that helps every is if an undamaged wave is coming to your tower, get familiar with how many turret shots and auto attacks it takes to kill a minion. For melee minions it’s two tower shots and an AA. caster minions it’s 2 AAs and a tower shot so I try to attack them all once before they get to the tower, that way I can finish them as the tower hits them. Siege minions I don’t know exactly but I usually wait until they’re one tower shot from death and use an ability to make sure I secure it.

If a wave is coming at you try to track which one will be targeted by the tower first and make sure you’re in a place to finish it- I.e. if it’s a caster that’s barely damaged, do nothing because a tower shot won’t kill and you can finish it with one AA, if it’s a melee at like 3/4 health try attacking it a couple times so after a tower shot you can last hit with one AA.

The more you practice the more you’ll recognize health levels and how many AA/turret hits it will take to kill each minion, and in what order they’ll be targeted, so you can find the optimal way to last hit as many as possible under tower. Even if you play it perfectly sometimes you won’t get them all, but it will improve your career a lot."
explainlikeimfive,fe2s7b6,t1_fe0o74i,1578842325.0,"Yeah, materials scientist here. Making candy is fascinatingly scientific. Depending on the temperature you cook sugar to, how it’s cooled, and how quickly it’s cooled, you can get radically different textures. Anything from toffee, caramel, taffy, glassy clear sugar, fudge, etc. all have specific temperatures you cook the sugar up to in order to get different textures.

If you look at a candy thermometer you can see how complex sugar can be.

So yeah, sugar serves an integral structural purpose in candy as well as taste, so that’s why you can’t replace it with fake sugar."
todayilearned,fdxkf79,t1_fdwn20t,1578769690.0,"Yeah it wasn’t fair for me to say America doesn’t have a food culture, that’s fair. I think a lot of it has to do with food you grew up eating, and for me the overall way I’d describe that is pretty bland. I also grew up outside DC in Virginia which is a pretty transient area of the country.

Yes there are lots of food traditions that are uniquely American, but the original post was talking about basing nutrition and diet around food cultures that have been shaped for hundreds or thousands of years, rather than trying to reverse engineer nutrition and how the body works, and from that standpoint I found it difficult to do that with uniquely American food."
todayilearned,fdwcsv5,t1_fdwa5aj,1578757426.0,"Oh yeah big fan. The later seasons got a little too political for me. Like tell me about their work and their artistic inspirations, I don’t need a sob story to be invested in the show.

I loved the Ivan Orkin episode especially, because I’m just some white guy looking for more interesting food than I grew up with too"
todayilearned,fdvw4j5,t1_fdv7c04,1578752301.0,"The more I dug into nutrition and trying to have a healthy diet, the more I realized we don’t know shit about it. Now I try to learn about older cooking traditions from other cultures and just not eat too much. Other than southern food America doesn’t really have a food culture, so I really enjoy learning about food from other countries and the history behind it."

AskNYC,fct5m24,t3_eik48l,1577933480.0,"Went to Threes brewing in gowanus. Arrived around 6 for trivia between 7-9, then stayed until midnight. No cover and great beer. Trivia was fun but only because we watched like hawks for a table to open up before 7. As soon as 10 pm or so hit the bar completely filled up, it was near impossible to even make it across through the sea of people, let alone get a drink at the bar.

Right as midnight struck and we watched the ball drop we walked to Sweet Polly and the scene was pretty great. Luckily we got a table and had a drink and it was pleasant.

Honestly NYE seems so hit or miss, like if the place you’re going to is well known at all it’s going to be mobbed with people by the time midnight rolls around."

engineering,fcrws65,t3_eikmmz,1577907692.0,"I was helping run an experiment at a major lab for my advisors and was doing it on my own. This had happened a couple times but it was still relatively new to me. The technician for the instrument loaded the sample holder in backwards, which meant samples 1-9 were actually numbered 9-1. I monitored the measurement and there was nothing grossly unusual about the initial results, so the measurement ran fully and because we only loaded samples in 5 of the slots we got no data on a couple of the samples and had run out of experiment time.

So basically I only got half the data we needed from this experiment, wasted time and made my colleague late for his deadline with the company that sent him the samples I was supposed to measure. I was still ahead student when this happened and I really got an earful, but when I presented the data I fully owned up to the mistake and admitted I should have checked the results more thoroughly, and that’s where it ended."

movies,fbpp0sw,t1_fbpobjs,1577023576.0,"Yeah, from the trailer it looked like there were some cool looking shots, and in terms of camera work it looked a lot more interesting and unique than just an audience view of a stage show. Granted that’s just the trailer, maybe most of the movie was shot unremarkably. For sure though adapting the script and the plot is a huge part of making something into a movie."
