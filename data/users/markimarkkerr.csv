You weren't joking, you posted the same question in 2 different subs, you're just trying to cover your embarrassment for being called out. Call it whatever you want, you're a fuckin mooch and nobody likes a mooch. I can't afford gas for a car so I don't drive, if you can't afford games for your switch then return your switch and buy something at your level of income, it's really simple!

I'm glad he made it though and could share such a personal moment. The mind can be so damn irrational sometimes while being the complete opposite at the same time! I used to watch documentaries and stuff like that but after my last attempt I just can't quite yet. Not that it'll put me back into wanting to hurt myself but just a sort of overwhelming sadness that I was so far gone at so many times in my life. It's like a mix of sympathy and embarrassment.

Thank you again and I couldn't have said it better. I made myself move 2300 miles and live in a place I had never been before to help me focus on what matters and it's significantly helped! Life is harder but it's  very beautiful now."

Switch,feid1kp,t1_fehlw0p,1579135658.0,"I manually cut all the pieces, my shop is pretty behind the times so no 3d printer unfortunately. once I design my template I cut the acrylic on a table saw, attach the template to the peices, use a rotozip and bandsaw to take the extra material off and then router the design. I then use a methyl hydrate solvent and adhere the acrylic together and flame polish the edges for a cleaner look. It's pretty fun work!"
Switch,feicmiy,t1_fefx2z0,1579135380.0,Yeah just realized the charger sits a bit awkward so I'll have to modify that spot. The distance isn't actually that big in person between the phone and switch. I made it a bit longer so there's just enough room to put an iPad or other tablet in. It's balanced enough too you could put the switch up top. Once I get a better design down I'll let you know! Haven't sold anything online before so I'll have to set something up.

todayilearned,feh9yvz,t1_feg2r8s,1579112225.0,"Thank you I appreciate that! I am doing much better and have taken a different approach to life that seems to be working.

Yeah it's such an odd experience, it's like when you feel like someone is staring at you , you look up and someone is. You can feel this acknowledgement and even if it's just all on our heads, it's comforting enough in the moment and that's all that matters. My first attempt to take my life was when I was 11 and long story short I went to jump off a cliff but at the last moment a dog ran over to me and was so excited and playful it shook me out of my mindset. Regardless of anything, animals are incredible!"

todayilearned,feff9f3,t3_eop78t,1579055083.0,"I had hung myself from a tree in November of 2015 and experienced this. I kept repeating to myself ""it's so easy"" in regards to letting go to try and disconnect from the reality of what I was doing. I remember I couldn't breathe anymore and the slap came right before I blacked out. The last thing I saw in my head was like a cut piece of wood, like the grain and knots which was pretty random and looking back very anticlimactic. I regained consciousness a good while later on the ground. the tree limb must've broke and then this little bird chilled with me until I got my senses back. I had just lost my grandfather somewhat recently and like to think it was him making sure I was good. 
The slap is probably pretty close to the feeling you'd get if you're about to jump from a high place and realize right before you jump it's a bad idea, but you're already pushing off."

Take a few hits and start to relax when just barely in my peripherals I see the dog from the next cottage slowly walking towards me. I think, oh nice he's looking for some scritches, I'll go pet him in a second after my joint. Right as I start to realize the people next door left a few days ago, this little fucking hand lightly grabs my upper arm, I turn and it's a goddamn big ol' racoon that was standing upright grabbing my arm, it backs off from me being startled and then just starts charging at me. Hucked the damn joint and ran for my life to the cottage lol 

Also another time at my cottage I was having a REAL good time with my girlfriend at the time, we were on a beach and after a while I hear some breathing, I look behind us and there's 2 goddamn racoons, sitting as if they were cross legged and just watching us go at it. They must've been there to go clam digging but saw we were instead.

In conclusion: Racoons are handsy perverts."
