You heard it here first--your actions only matter if they directly affect the course of the future. James Potter, you can piss right off, as it was Lily's death that protected Harry and not yours. Remus and Tonks, we're not sure if you took down any death eaters before dying, so your deaths may have been meaningless. Same to you, Fred. Sirius, too. Luna, you were part of the triad that spearheaded the rebellion at Hogwarts in DH, but only Neville destroyed a Horcrux, so only Neville really matters. The rest of you can sod right off, because the willingness to fight for what is right even when it seems hopeless isn't good enough; it's not like that is a theme of the series or anything. Oh wait...

Ginny survived being possessed by Voldemort at age 11, participated in underground combat training at age 14, fought Death Eaters at the Department of Mysteries at age 14, and ran a rebellion against torturous death eaters in her school at age 16. She almost died multiple times fighting for the greater good. She knowingly put herself at risk of being tortured multiple times fighting for the greater good. Ginny is not ""little missus stays at home"" just because she didn't go on the Horcrux hunt."

Meanwhile, the point of body positivity is that no matter what, you never should nor have to hate your body. They’re literally constantly mocking and putting down LOVING YOUR OWN BODY which is basic mental health!

No, they're mocking and putting down the people who say that body positivity supersedes any sort of health advice from your doctor, warning signs from your own body, and general common sense about the fact that people can, in fact, be *way too big*.

>Stuff like **denying that maybe fat people should be involved in the study of fat bodies** isnt asking much. How fucking hateful do you have to be to think only thin people can understand fat people? To want to exclude fat scientists is not about health, and that is not how science works.

I can't find that exact post, but I remember seeing it. IIRC, it was not saying that fat scientists should be excluded; it was saying that it isn't valid to disregard research just because none of the scientists included were fat.

>You actually think Im making up “people make fun of fat people” at the gym, biking, dancing, swimming?

No one is denying that happens in real life; it just doesn't happen in that sub.

>Are you even fat? Cuz kinda seems like you’re trying to gaslight me here. I didnt make up my own experience to inconvenience you lol..

It is about hating *ideas*, not people. HAES? Yeah, that's garbage. Body positivity? It's a great concept that does a lot of good but has been perverted at the extreme ends of the spectrum. The idea that gets mocked the most on that sub is the idea that pursuing *any* kind of weight loss is harmful, dangerous, or means you have an eating disorder. The majority of posts on that sub are in that vein--just expressing shock at the number of people who actually believe that's true. FFS, these are people who gatekeep fatness to exclude ""smallfats"" and insist that fat artwork include ""infinifats"" (yes, that is an actual post active on that sub). *That* is fatlogic, and *that* is what the sub is for.

Why is having access to your partner’s private device a deal breaker for you? It sounds like you have the same viewpoint as the GF, and I don’t understand it."
exchristian,fcwitzo,t3_ej90qn,1578026782.0,"Not to mention the fact that, in the US, rapists still have parental rights in many (most?) states. That 13 year-old gets to have a baby she doesn’t want, suffer the psychological trauma of that, suffer the physiological trauma of childbirth, and THEN hand over the baby to her rapist for visitations."

Apples? Here’s a plastic bag of them. Orange bell peppers? Get one in this three-pack with one orange, one yellow, and one red. 

I had to take the hit to my budget and start going to Family Fare to satisfy my conscience."

I'm brought back to the post and hit schedule post and it resets the time and date that I picked and I'm forced to re-enter it.
