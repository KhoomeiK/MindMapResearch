jobs,fdn26o5,t3_em8cus,1578575040.0,I want to express my solidarity to this person who so courageously exposed her problem in this chat
jobs,fdn234s,t3_em8cus,1578574951.0,"Thanks for replying. For me was a really disaster. 
I was threatened very bad. 
I had a work colleague very jealous. She didn’t let me work in peace. She was really jealous because I speak more foreign languages than her. 
She succeeded to convince my boss that I wasn’t good enough for that kind of job. 
Instead I was great!😔"
jobs,fdn1rp1,t3_em8cus,1578574661.0,"I am very sorry that similar things still happen in 2020. I'm so sorry about what's happening to you. I had a bad work experience in 2019. I know what that means. The only thing I can advise you is to relax and try to focus on all those beautiful things you know. If you can focus on these things, you will arrive at the next job interview with more positive thoughts and as a result you will transmit precisely this energy. 
Keep moving forward.
I wish you all the best for this year.💪🏻💼"

Depression is the lute of the soul. When we go into depression, it means we reject contact with life.
We close ourselves in ourselves, we don't want to communicate with anyone.
The nights become endless and the darkness becomes our best friend.
I remind you, yet, that it can be an opportunity to reborn and start seeing the world in a new way.
It makes us understand that we have to change something in us.
There are many causes of depression and we find it hard to understand why it comes into our lives. The good news is that you've started looking for help.
I'm sure this year will be the year that you will take courage and start taking action.
You've found the strength to write and to express your pain. It makes us realize that you want to get out of this tunnel. I’m sure that you'll see that at the end of this last one, there's light and you'll be reborn.
I've noticed a lot of solidarity and support here in this chat and you've received a lot of advice.
The most important is to see a specialist. Believe me, it's worth it.
Books are a great source, but in this case it's better that you combine them with some extra help at the same time.
Go to the gym and try to stay outdoors as long as you can.
Listen to music because it has positive vibes that connect you to the universe.
If you have any friends try to get out, but avoid alcohol or any super-alcoholics.
The most important thing of all is ""start loving yourself like you never have"" this is your moment.
Remember that the gift of life is unique and unrepeatable. I realized that after five years I got out of it.
I wish you all the best for this 2020. 
Gisel"
