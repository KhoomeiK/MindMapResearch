news,feo8j0w,t3_eq1u06,1579296579.0,"Broke my skull when I was 4. My mom, a pharmacist at the time, but was taking courses to become a surgeon, knew basic things to do to increase my survival. Took me to the ER because the closest ambulance was nearly 45 mins away, despite the hospital being maybe 10-15. Got there, and with 3 soaked towels to the back of my head, the receptionist told my mom that it’d be a 45min-1.5hour wait. 

As destiny would decide against my death, I threw up watermelon (apparently looked closed enough to blood) that they immediately took me back.

Lost so much blood that I flatlined 2 times during initial OP to control the blood loss. Obviously survived, but it was “enraging to the point that I (my mom) was about to go back and start operating myself.”"

Edit: honestly, either way works.

If it’s the doctor, he’s being sarcastic about there being any toxins in vaccines.

If it’s the commenters, then being sarcastic about anti-vax bs"

Showerthoughts,feh86w3,t1_fegvtse,1579111154.0,"Basically, there’s either 2 or 3 sith at any time. If there’s 2, then it’s a master and an apprentice. If it’s 3, then it’s a master (to be killed soon by their apprentice), an apprentice (soon to be a new master), and an unknown (soon to be new apprentice).

Always loved that idea that the sith slowly get more and more powerful with each new set as the master would only be killed once their apprentice surpassed their own power."

Trust me: the fraternity bros will see the shift, especially if you aren’t a freshman, and you’ll look sketchy/fake asf.

Don’t try to match other people’s drinking, do what your comfortable with, but make sure to check if your rush is dry or not (most likely dry) so you don’t get the frat into any trouble.

Ngl it’s a tough topic, but it’s up to you what you do.

Also: do NOT go too far out of the way to impress the bros. It makes you look desperate to get a bid..."

AskReddit,fc3f3n2,t1_fc27a22,1577388405.0,"My dad is the biggest proponent of “anything but perfect is absolute failure.” Ever since I was maybe 10, when he first started actively participating in my growth and such, he’s demanded a “touch it once” philosophy, that being: don’t do anything more than once, if it isn’t perfect after the first attempt, you’re a failure. I’ve hit a slump where I can’t motivate myself enough to reach my potential (proven by my 32 ACT score without so much as lifting a single paper to study). I have to keep finding things to motivate myself, but I burn out very easily."

Frat,fc16woc,t1_fc12z8v,1577309983.0,"Depends on your weight class.

If blacked - F

If not blacked, not F

Since it’s with fam - F for Brotherhood

At a 1 y/o’s B-day party - not F (negative rep of frat)

Consensus - heavily dependent on situation, but generally not F

Edit: clarification"
Frat,fc16qox,t1_fc112z3,1577309846.0,"Trucks - F*

Tacoma’s - low tier F

Consensus - variability between regions and style of truck makes this a low tier F in northern regions, mid tier in southern regions

*depends on region of Chapter, as SOME northern chapters aren’t as truck-centric as their southern counterparts. 

Edit: grading scale not clear enough."
