The cheapest/simplest option is probably an A/B/Y pedal or something like the Boss LS-2 which will let you blend 2 input signals into a single output."

There are a few BBD reverbs too apparently, but 99% of reverb pedals are indeed digital. And even some of the ones I've seen advertised as ""analog"" are actually hybrid using BBD + algorithms."
guitarpedals,ffad8rb,t3_esjf7w,1579732810.0,">That brings me to my next question. I don’t have any experience with stereo rigs or dual input pedals but, If I plug my guitar in Input A and the synth in input B, do I need 2 separate amps for each instrument? Or can I run both through my guitar amp? 

I believe generally plugging into both inputs will route the signal in stereo to both outputs, that seems to be how stereo pedals usually operate.  You could use a mixer/blender to mix both signals into the mono input, or an A/B pedal to switch the guitar/synth into the input. 

As for if your amp will work, that depends on how much headroom it has. If the loops are too loud it might start to push the amp into OD especially when you play over them. If you have a very clean amp and use pedals for your dirt it should work fine.

I do a lot of looping on keys/guitar and microphones and I've found the easiest option is a decent mixer with an FX loop (or an AUX send/return to make a loop). Then you just put the looper in the FX loop and route any channel you want to loop through it. I run a mono and stereo loop with a mono and stereo looper in series, so I can make a short loop in mono then run it through all my pedals before looping it again in stereo. Very fun for experimenting.

If you have a PA or speaker set up those can be ideal for looping, I use 2 active speakers and a decent mixer. One other thing I've found very helpful for looping is a compressor/limiter, that way you can set it to reduce any peaks or volume buildup from overdubs. I run a cheap stereo limiter after the looper to keep the volume just right in the mixer."

guitarpedals,ff77h06,t1_ff5s252,1579642628.0,"I just set mine up recently after having the module laying around for years, surprised how good it sounds. Now I just need another stereo Tonecore pedal to use the module with as right now it's in a mono one. 

One thing that really impressed me is it can do some great ring mod sounds. The rate doesn't quite go high enough on it's own but the Peak control can push it into ring mod territory, except with the pitch controlled by the input volume which is crazy. Run a fuzz first to boost the signal for extra high pitched madness."
guitarpedals,ff76izr,t1_ff6hap4,1579642096.0,"> I mean real synthesizers are probably a lot easier to use than these wacky guitar synth monstrosities. 

Hell back in the day guitarists would just plug right into something like the Arp 2600's external input, so you could run guitar through the modules. That is how a lot of famous early guitar synth sounds were done:

Man I love my ultranova, have spent years trying out new ideas on it and learning about how synthesizers work. It is definitely confusing at first but if you take your time learning how each section interacts it's not too bad. 

The editor makes it really easy too, just load up patches you like and dissect them in the editor to learn how they work. I spent awhile doing that to learn how to make more realistic piano/string/woodwind patches among other things. 

Just made a killer FM organ patch recently, it sounds like a 3 way Leslie/Rotary as it uses 3 oscillators set to -12/0/+12 pitch so they cover 3 octaves. And you can manually adjust the density detune for each one, which causes the oscillator to warble like a rotary. That into a chorus makes a really authentic Leslie sound except you can adjust the speed of the low/med/high signal. Really cool, sounds very authentic."
