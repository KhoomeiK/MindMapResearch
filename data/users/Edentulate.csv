todayilearned,fecms68,t1_fec7blc,1578977793.0,"Love this comment.

Seems like very few understand this.

Not managing timber stands creates uncontrollable fires and is far worse for the environment. 

With that said, old growth forests do need some unique habitats and need some preservation / protection 

But removing diseased and damaged trees is important to forest health and gives new trees the opportunity/light to grow so that we have trees to replace the old ones when they break or die from age or disease"

First, Reddit is a very biased place to ask questions. They actively quarantine and Black ball conservative voices.

Second, the deep state goes beyond civil servants... though that may be part of it.

To understand the deep state consider the FBI Inspector General’s report.... how it revealed that the FBI all the way up to James Comey was actively involved in trying to investigate Trump’s election campaign and fabricated evidence to try to damage him.

Consider that the IG report found that Hillary Clinton’s campaign paid for this fabricated evidence.

Consider that while the Clinton Foundation now receives less than 1/10th of the money it did when Hillary was running for president.... when she was running, Ukraine was her top donor, Joe Biden admits that he pressured Ukraine to drop the investigation into his son’s oil company, that Hunter Biden, John Kerry, Adam Schuff, and Nancy Pelosi all have children on the boards of Ukrainian oil companies"
