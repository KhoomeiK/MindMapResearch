Guildwars2,ffxyi1k,t1_ffxworn,1580334921.0,">mastering the mechanics is meaningless when you're bottlenecked by DPS which determines whether you clear the fight.  

This is true for every single raid, very few groups can last 2-3x longer on any raid boss, most groups can pass a few minutes tops before people start drowning like flies, half of the raid bosses enrage is a wipe anyway.  

> I think ArenaNet really needs to decide what the purpose of Public Strikes are. Is it a hard-fought mechanical challenge? Is it a moderate stepping-stone into raids that has a DPS check?  

It's a stepping stone into raids, you need baby steps, hell half the groups who ran icebrood wouldn't even get 3 chests, boneskinner and whisper are your ""Git Gud"" boss, they are ridiculously easy if you are an experienced raider but quite challenging to a newbie, it's the points where you need to take a look at *why* you are failing, try different comps and figure it out, there should be a bit of hand holding which there was, 3 bosses who are easily passed which slowly got harder into boneskinner and now this."

watchpeoplesurvive,fez67so,t1_feys5ra,1579454201.0,"It's most likely to stop oil cooking. In turbos and super charged cars you can damage your bearings if you lay on the throttle hard then shut off the engine. Basically your engine works both the oil pump and water pump only when running, as soon as its turned off no more circulation. If your turbo is still spinning at a high rpm when you shut the car off you can basically cook the engine oil into your bearings which will cause failure much faster than normal, it's why it's highly advised to let the car run an extra minute before shutting it off if run high, gives time for everything to slow down and cool."

trashy,feycpfp,t1_fey915m,1579443826.0,"To increase your speed you cant be looking at the keyboard. Put it into muscle memory and memorization of the keyboard and you can go from 15-20 wpm (words per minute) to over 100. I can type around 70wpm last I checked and that's still considered ""Slow"" those that look at the keyboard for specific numbers/letters cut into their time significantly, some jobs require a high wpm (50+, sometimes 90-100+) and they usually get paid pretty well for that particular skill. Is it easy? No, that's why classes and such are necessary along with lots of practice to hit speeds required for jobs. You can't just smash out incorrect spelling either, we are talking grammatically correct damn near perfect typing at 90+ it's a seriously hard skill to learn."

>All **legendary precursors** that have a collection can only be crafted once. So gen 1 and Gen 2 (Hope, Nevermore, Astralaria, and Chuka) have that limit. Gen 2.5 can be crafted more than once"

This is what direction the game is headed, we have a new strike mission that hopefully is harder than boneskinner, most raiders and CM players want harder more complex more challenging content because that's what we like."
Guildwars2,fek8wg0,t1_fek2kb8,1579195052.0,"Then like i said maybe this game is simply not for you anymore. It happens and it's time to say good bye. I personally dislike a lot, including most of what you said. Lack of new fractals, no new raids, most good skins locked behind the gemstore instead of it being introduced as rewards (CM raids? Dhuum CM? Hello?!?) But there are positives. Theres a free LWS5, looks like a potential port to consoles (from shaman himself), more story, another strike mission, a complete PvP/WvW overhaul in the works that seems to be nearing the end according to them. If you dont enjoy what's in the pipeline then it's time to put down the game for a bit."
Guildwars2,fek1etq,t3_epks36,1579190541.0,"What I think most people dont realize is maybe the game isnt for you. Yes you want incredibly hard fights, so do I, I love the pressure, the feeling after 3 hours of wiping on a kill that was so damn messy it should have wiped 3x over, to come back to the same fight and nail it down to a science. Raids, Fractals, CMs that's what I love, but this game is clearly not headed in that direction, maybe it's time to find a new game if it's that upsetting."
Guildwars2,fek13ve,t1_fejyppz,1579190355.0,"I'm not a casual, I raid, CM fractals, teach etc. I love the incredibly challenging fights. I have around 3k hours in and I do have my criticisms (lack of hard content) I also enjoy the easy relaxing side and how inviting this game is. You dont need to have pure hate for this *game* 24/7 because it's not headed in the direction you want, you can do both, enjoy the game and the new free content while disliking the lack of content you like. If it's not headed in the right direction like harder content pick up another MMO that fits that need. Anet does some shit right, that's all OP was saying and instead of throwing insult after insult maybe sit down and look at the positives."
holdmyfeedingtube,fejqv55,t1_fejkqoj,1579183569.0,"Not even close. Without context it looks like women A and B are fighting, man tries to intervene to break up the fight, hes not swinging at the top lady (who seems to be the one hes targeting) hes not actively trying to cause damage hes pushing and trying to force his way in. he pushes them to try to seperate, woman C threatens man with a high heel, which can do some serious damage mind you. Woman threatens man, man stops, she persists, he slaps her then goes back to trying to break up the fight. Ever been hit with a blunt object like the one in the video?

Guildwars2,fegulfx,t1_fegp1x7,1579102882.0,"I'd disagree on the ""DPS meter doesnt matter"" it's pretty viable to determine what your party can and cant accomplish. If you are pulling 70k on MO for example you are going to have a rough time with claim, you dont want to burn invuln on 3rd spikes to just stack through and kill fast. Gorsevol you need to know if no updrafts is possible, hell you need to know if gorse **is** possible. High dps is king because you can shorten the fight, apply quicker, easier strats or downright stop bad RNG like sab and her flame walls fucking with cannon times or having people peel off for orb/spear control. Dps meter is incredibly useful because most fights are so much easier with higher dps."

Guildwars2,fe9a58o,t3_eo6qpr,1578935757.0,"Itll depend on what you are running what the best support/heal role is. Open world is mostly face roll easy so no one really heals but it's not going to get you hate if you do. Fractals Healbrand (Guardian) and Alacrigade (Revenant) are your support classes that are almost universally wanted. Raids is Druid (Ranger) Alacrigade (Revenant) Chrono (Mesmer) Quickbrand (Guardian) Tempest (elementalist) and scourge (necro) which will vary on each fight. For example Scourge healer is only good on 1-2 fights, chrono tank is fairly standard, Quickbrand is more DPS oriented, Druid is always in, always, tempest is usually a backup healer etc. Itll really depend on what you want to do. For raids multi-class is the way to go, you'll want at least 1 support, 1 confi, 1 power class to be viable."

politics,fe54pra,t1_fe4lqhz,1578865633.0,"A couple of issues. One and 2. it was misquoted, my bad I am human, we all make mistakes, it was 2% off, not like I was trying to quote ""almost 50%"" when it was 35%. 

 Your 2% only accounts for those directly at $7.25, if they pay $7.50 it's not counted, it's only an extra $10/wk at 40 hours but it's not counted. Make $7.30? Not counted, that's an additional $2/wk, not even enough for a gallon of gas. $7.26? Too bad, an extra $0.40/wk puts you out of the statistic, that's exactly what this is talking about, $10/hr isnt enough to live off of. Hell Mc Donald's near me pays $7.40/hr, they aren't minimum wage but it's still nowhere near enough to support someone. If that 44% is true then we have a serious issue. $18,000/yr to live off of is ridiculous, that's like $275/wk, that's not enough to save, not enough to go to college off of, that's scraping by which we the tax payers will end up footing the bill for when they get sick, or when they get older."
politics,fe4kv2w,t1_fe4jy2b,1578860394.0,">In a recent analysis, we found that 53 million workers ages 18 to 64—or 44% of all workers—earn barely enough to live on. Their median earnings are $10.22 per hour, and about $18,000 per year. These low-wage workers are concentrated in a relatively small number of occupations, including retail sales, cooks, food and beverage servers, janitors and housekeepers, personal care and service workers (such as child care workers and patient care assistants), and various administrative positions.

politics,fe41u9f,t1_fe3z525,1578854986.0,"1150 minus healthcare, taxes, 401k (you should be saving) and more puts you at around $250/wk. I make over 3x minimum wage, for a straight 40 hours after taxes, 401k, health insurance etc. My take home is around $700 for comparison if I work 40 claiming 2. If your rent is $600 that leaves you with $400 for a month, not including gas, food, electricity, water, trash, car payment/insurance, heat, internet, phone. It's not enough to live on in most of the country as $600/mo for a 1 bed 1 bath is dirt cheap in most places. I live in the middle of nowhere, its $475 for a studio/mo.
