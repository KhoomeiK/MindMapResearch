Skinny guy with the hand twirling and the big guy throws a lot of punches where it's all from a flat footed stance and very few punches where he actually throws his weight behind it. The latter is very typical of ""I'm gonna teach you how to box"" in the basement kind of deal.

science,ffm1bn5,t1_fflerhs,1580046964.0,"Well theres a difference between having valid proof vs opinions.

If someone says ""yeah this can be fun, but be careful with it,"" there's really no responsibility in whether that person has fun or not.

On the other hand if you offer it to someone and say ""this is one way to have a cure for your [very serious condition X], trust me,"" there's a definite need for certain validity to that claim. 

Like if someone says ""you know, smelling peppermint oil makes me feel better in the mornings, try spraying some on your clothes,"" theres no problems. If someone says ""peppermint oil has compounds that will cure your depression,"" they better back up that shit with data."
science,ffm0459,t1_ffkw8ro,1580046377.0,"Exactly this. I'm all for the expansion of treatment pathways via medical or psychedelic means but I'm really really getting sick of people going around saying marijuana/LSD/DMT/shrooms can solve all of everyone's mental issues. 

I def know some people where they dont drink but smoke weed once in a while and function fine. Conversely I also know people that smoke weed and not only has it made them *too* okay with things and dont go anywhere in life or made them paranoid/stubborn (latter example: ""NO, YOU DONT GET IT! YOURE NOT ACCEPTING THE TRUTH!"")

Some things work for some people and some things don't. Plenty of people that do other things but dont smoke weed bc it makes them too anxious and plenty of people that dont do shrooms bc they think it'd be too intense, and that's okay. I'm glad they're doing more research but just like prescriptions some people dont react well to certain substances and I wish the louder proponents would understand that instead of thinking drugs are the way to solving everyone's problems."

Friend from a middle class family moved to Chicago to join UCB with no school plans or anything. People didnt like him enough to say he wasnt that funny. Last I heard he was waiting tables and that was almost 10 years ago and his youtube channel hasn't been active in years.

Another friend constantly goes into debt betting on various things - thinly veiled pyramid schemes (several), stocks, crypto, outright gambling etc.

Hes deep 5 figs in debt from various things but all he'll talk about is his new Tesla, how he ""knew"" Tesla would succeed (as opposed to all his other failed stocks), and how bitcoin is going to a million by 2020 (as opposed to all the other crypto he's lost his money on)."
