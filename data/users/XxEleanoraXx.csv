vegancirclejerk,fekswa9,t1_feksnei,1579206919.0,"Yeah true. The companies should be held accountable, and people need to try to help get it fixed. If I mention being vegan, theyll turn it into a huge thing and it just never works. Everyone ends up arguing, and I can’t get my point across"
vegancirclejerk,fekr77f,t1_fekqhkg,1579205923.0,"Yeah I suppose. I feel like it’s the general fact that people generally know about factory farm stuff, but ignore it"
vegancirclejerk,fekp9tz,t1_fekon7a,1579204778.0,"Yeah I dunno. I’m getting myself confused now. I know I’m not perfect by any means, but I try to do what I can do. Without my phone, I wouldn’t have survived this long tbh"
vegancirclejerk,fekp4vp,t1_feknxco,1579204697.0,Well I normally wouldn’t think about that. I’d feel bad saying I’m ethically superior because it sounds conceited (if that’s the right word) and it makes me feel like I’m being rude or something even if I am in reality ethically superior
vegancirclejerk,feknw03,t1_feknkiw,1579203960.0,Yeah. Nicer to me than people irl. Just had a mini conversation with people about veganism and it didn’t turn into an argument. I’m honestly surprised but it was nice
vegancirclejerk,feknt47,t1_fekmg2f,1579203912.0,Yeah. I never consider myself perfect. Especially since I struggle with having zero self confidence and self esteem anyway
vegancirclejerk,fekn2oq,t1_fekm0nl,1579203475.0,"Yeah totally. I never am like I’m so superior to you. I have emotional issues and am very insecure so I’d never say that anyway. I just think once, I’m ethically superior and then never really think about that again. I just don’t know why people would still support that type of thing. Vegetarians confuse me tbh. Have the same idea but aren’t vegan"
vegancirclejerk,feklr2r,t1_fekkunr,1579202684.0,Totally. You don’t tell them it’s vegan until after they eat it. I joke and call veganism a cult sometimes
vegancirclejerk,fekkc5p,t1_fekk6po,1579201849.0,Sounds fun! You destroying them I mean. I have vegan cookies and I’ve given them out and people love them
vegancirclejerk,fekk9os,t1_fek3xrp,1579201809.0,Yeah agreed.
vegancirclejerk,fek88id,t1_fek5erx,1579194658.0,Maybe. I’m very bad at not caring. I’ll just watching those things. People have suggested it to me
vegancirclejerk,fek3umu,t1_fek33i5,1579192040.0,"Ah gotcha. I have tried to inform people about what happens, and we had a whole unit last year in school where we talked about meat and different diets. We watched a thing at some point where there were cows getting pushed with a tractor. I was very vocal with how I feel about all of it, and people still didn’t care. If someone says they’re gonna go vegan or do anything like that, I’ll encourage them. I personally find it hypocritical to call yourself an animal lover when you still support the industry that kills them but it’s not like I can really force anything on anyone. I think I’ve turned a couple people vegan tho. Mostly cause those people were actually respectful about it so I didn’t mind answering their questions. They weren’t other students trying to bother me, but rather people who were genuinely curious with no malicious intent. My mom says they reacted the way they did because it makes them question their morals. It makes them think about something they don’t want to think about, and question their actions. That’s why my mom thought they acted so aggressively when I tried to express myself. It just turned into arguments. 
I hope I’m understanding what you said correctly"
vegancirclejerk,fek2t8l,t1_fek1sji,1579191408.0,"Ah ok that makes more sense. I feel like I generally more claim that we are superior cause of being vegan, but then I say it as if we’re superior as individuals cause of that. Damn. I said that once during school last year. That was shitty of me. Others berate me for being vegan tho. That’s why I’m not vocal about it anymore. People are generally hard to deal with"
vegancirclejerk,fek1gjh,t1_fejy22r,1579190571.0,Can you explain that last paragraph bit? I’m a bit confused and I feel stupid
vegancirclejerk,fejx4m9,t1_fejwnoc,1579187861.0,"Thanks. I generally have people around me make me feel bad for thinking things like that, especially since there isn’t really any other vegans. With a couple exceptions anyway"
vegancirclejerk,fejtyg0,t3_epilnr,1579185786.0,"Honestly, I feel like being vegan makes us at the very least, ethically superior. I feel bad thinking that tho. Is it wrong of me to feel ethically superior cause of the fact that I don’t actually contribute to the horrible industry that is the one we get our meat from?"
vegancirclejerk,fejjp1h,t1_fejczkm,1579177088.0,"Thank you. I should probably see if I should post more on here so I finally get to talk to vegans. Everyone else in my household is vegan, and so is one of my teachers at school (yay!) It feels nice that I’m not the only one. Everyone else generally makes me feel bad for being vegan. I remember once we saw a photo essay in class. It was about this like mountain tribe in Japan. One of the photos was of a bear cub being dragged out in the snow with a blood trail behind it. And the next one was just the paw, with some flesh showing. I almost cried and the photographer we were working with and the teacher apologized to me. Someone got mad at me when I said how I hate that stuff later, since it’s their culture and I should be respectful."
vegancirclejerk,fehgl3b,t1_fehg4lh,1579116106.0,"I do that as a punishment to myself. For not being good enough for others. For being so horrible. And it’s affecting me negatively but he’s really wanting to die, and I care about him, and I want to stop him. I actually asked to get therapy last year. That was denied since my mom had a bad experience. And it’s only happening now because I got into an argument with my parents where i expressed my emotions and I got cursed at and they told me how I ruined the trip we were on and that they couldn’t handle me"
vegancirclejerk,fehfw6k,t1_fehfp48,1579115701.0,Yeah I self harm. And I can’t ignore him. I need to do the opposite. He’s in a really bad state and I want to help him. And arguing with others would cause me more trouble. Probably ruin my already shitty school life
vegancirclejerk,fehfe06,t1_fehf5kr,1579115404.0,"Maybe. I’m not sure anymore. I blame myself for everything. My ex is texting me stuff rn that’s making me more stressed, and I just don’t know what to do. I do well in school, but that’s all I have. I don’t really have friends or much of a family to talk to. I just have to try to resist the urge to cut until I get a therapist in like 3 months"
vegancirclejerk,fehekvd,t1_fehed1g,1579114931.0,Yeah. I’ve done that so many times. Like right now. And I feel fuckin stupid and pathetic for it. They end. And it’s my fault. I know it is. And that makes it so much worse
vegancirclejerk,fehdaa9,t1_fehd4sk,1579114185.0,"Thank you. I trust too much only cause I believe in people. People abandon me, but I don’t abandon people. I just want someone to support me. I want to feel like someone cares. And it feels like asking for that is too much"
vegancirclejerk,fehc3wc,t1_fehbnce,1579113503.0,"I don’t try converting anymore. That never ends well. I’m not good at waiting for shit, especially when it comes to love. I’m gonna be 16 soon. I just have such a fucked up mind, and sometimes I can actually believe my bfs. I mean that as in I never believe compliments or believe in myself. With bfs, I sometimes believe them. I can be somewhat better because it’s the one time I feel supported, feel loved and cared for. I just don’t really have a support group. So I end up caring too much and trusting too quick, which gets me into trouble."
vegancirclejerk,fehak9t,t1_feha552,1579112583.0,"I date them because since I’m a teen, I don’t really have any other choices. If I think about it too much, I’ll start hating them for it. I do plan to get married to a vegan tho when I grow up. I just want love too much from people rn cause of my fucked mental state to really think about it much."
vegancirclejerk,fegq7at,t1_fegq0jt,1579099943.0,Oh I don’t even think about that. I just never feel good enough for others. I haven’t gotten therapy even tho I asked my parents last year. I’m only gonna get it soon cause my parents said they couldn’t handle me when we had an argument after I said how things they said hurt me. I might be too young to go advocacy stuff. I don’t even know where I’d go
vegancirclejerk,fegpff6,t1_fegp9h1,1579099408.0,"Agreed. There’s supposed to be a bunch of vegans that exist in the world. But where? We even lost close family friends cause they said stupid shit about veganism. I don’t really have much of a support group in general, getting told how I’m a perfect example of how being vegan means you’re more likely to be depressed. I can talk to my family about vegan stuff but if I want any emotional support from them, then I’m screwed. Hence me going on Reddit"
vegancirclejerk,fegp6hy,t1_fegozww,1579099236.0,Yeahhh. That’s why I don’t do it anymore. People should be accepting since it’s a damn environmental and social justice school but they don’t.
vegancirclejerk,fegovu9,t1_feghbrp,1579099026.0,Thanks. I appreciate that
vegancirclejerk,fegov7r,t1_feglyf7,1579099014.0,Yeah. I’ve turned some people vegan actually. I don’t generally say much about it anymore since it’s just a mess and gets me into arguments. I even had this ass who threatened to beat me up and eat my dogs numerous times. I cried so much. Still do
vegancirclejerk,feggxkd,t3_eoyans,1579092398.0,"Veganism is weird. I say that as a vegan, and as someone who’s received a lot of hate for it. When I turned vegan like two years ago (I’m a child so yay early vegan), I got bullied for it. I was ostracized from people at lunch and most people made stupid comments. They made fun of me for reading The Happy Vegan, since I wasn’t happy since I ended up arguing with everyone else when they said stupid shit about veganism. I got told by someone who has an extreme allergy to milk (don’t we all?) that I would die. Another person tried to offer me cricket skin if I remember correctly. Another person said only meat has protein. My friends mom was vegan but she took something non vegan so she wouldn’t be rude. Last year, it was even worse. And I go to an environmental and social justice school -.-  My bf made me feel horrible about it, saying me being vegan didn’t do anything. People would ask if sucking dick is vegan and I’d get into a lot of arguments cause I wouldn’t hold my tongue. If someone has a legit question and is respectful about it, I’ll answer. Most people act like asses about it tho. Like when we go see the chickens and then everyone including my current bf says about wanting to eat chicken and stuff. I’m so done with people. Sorry for this long rant I’m just horrible emotionally and this makes it so much worse. I never want to go back, but it’s really hard to deal with people relating to it. Especially family"

memes,fdkr8p1,t1_fdjv9lq,1578509482.0,"I agree. People need help and support. If they don’t that support and help, they crumble.

I know I need to get a more positive mindset, and try to force myself to believe people with compliments but it’s so damn hard and people can’t just acknowledge the little things and say things like I’m proud of you for resisting the urge to cut.

That’s how you get people to stop being open about their feelings. I know that would make me wanna shut down and isolate myself and not tell anyone how I’m feeling. Therapists won’t tell me what I wanna hear. I go to the social worker at my school too. I know I’m not fuckin perfect but at least a therapist would make me feel like I have someone to talk to and help me cope better with all the shit I deal with.
