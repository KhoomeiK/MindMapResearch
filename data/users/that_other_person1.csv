offmychest,ffi0e6t,t3_etr1io,1579961223.0,"Sounds to me you're dealing with a combination of negative self talk and not developing yourself into a person you're proud of. I think the negative self talk is something that is honestly best dealt with by a therapist. Or you could try doing behavioral treatment therapy packets as a way to help yourself (I have a bachelor's in psychology and learned briefly about therapies, and this is something you can do).

It also seems like you should just branch out and find something or things you love doing. Sometimes you even have to push yourself to do something you love, as it's easy to just browse on social media, reddit, or watch Netflix. I've been there. I feel so much better about myself when I accomplish something or learn something.

Well for me I moved out a few weeks before he immigrated into our apartment, and continued on working as usual, but now I was moved out from my parents' house, so I was doing all the cooking and cleaning. I've been aware of how to cook for a long time, so the transition wasn't hard in that sense. 

I was used to doing chores, I just now had a whole apartment to clean (my husband does daily chores, admin, fixing stuff, et cetera). I have always been fairly independent and have been very into crafts as an adult and fine tuning the crafts I do. I was still working on them with my husband here, I just did it in the same room as he works on his computer. We go out and do little things occasionally together. It was a really easy transition.

We've never had fights, he's just occasionally calmly pointed out a few minor things that should be changed, and rightfully so. And me to him. We just calmly comment things and adjust our behavior and habits accordingly. We are both very logical, calm people, so it has never been hard for us to get along at all times."

Having a hobby entails a degree of exploration and willingness to do something your friends may not like and can often involve degrees of being alone. You also may have to have a degree of free time so you can even explore what you like. It involves dedication to stick to doing something society doesn't always commend you for doing (the activities I mentioned are partaking in versions of the societal narrative, so many people feel a pull to partake in those activities, or they're instantly rewarding to our brains).

I think growing up, you develop this very basic story in your head for how your future will be, and if it will be hard or easy. You also learn quite well the way your parents do things. When you're young, you will see it as it is, and not the ways to fix any problems happening.

I think these stories we have in our heads and ideas of how our parents did things is deeply ebgraibed in us. If we were abused, neglected, were poor, et cetera, it is difficult for us to picture our lives and how we can achieve things. Many people will just do what they've seen and expected they'd do as children.

quilling,fdf5x31,t3_el2iv0,1578354044.0,"I will skip the beginning drivel that will not get to the point. Would I recommend this book? Absolutely. Is it exactly all that I was hoping it to be? Honestly, no, but much of my critique most people likely wouldn't even notice when reading this book as I wanted to be inspired, which it definitely surpassed my expectations on, but there are still a lot of boring questions I have for how exactly she goes about things. I have just emailed her showing a few of my recent works and asking if she would answer a few of my questions. Hopefully she will, because then my experience from this book would be near perfect (even though it isn't in the book exactly).

The pictures are stunning, and she does superb explaining her creative process on them, and in some cases shows some work in progress pictures, which is great for see how she works on pictures. 

There are multiple parts to the book, mostly based on the different types of quilling she does, and the slightly different creative processes involving the different categories. 

She has various tips sprinkled through the book, and only one main section for one of her particular techniques, ""painting"" with paper. This was a gold section which is about how she has dense packed strips in sections of some types of her pictures (particularly portraits, which seems to be about half of her work). I wish there was more sections re-iterating more practical tips which are through the whole book. For instance, she mentions how she keeps her glue open for months sometimes for it to dry out more so it will dry quicker when she uses it. She doesn't explain how she uses glue in more depth than that. I recently made a post with a few of my supplies and how I do a few things with my supplies, and explain how I use glue. I would have liked to read more about that, even if it was really dry and quick. This is just one example of many things I'm still unclear on.

This book is worth reading for sure. She explains really well some things to do with quilling, like color selection, how to do backgrounds, how to have a balanced quilling picture, et cetera. She has many unique techniques (not just her on edge and painting on paper techniques), which could greatly add to the versatility and interest of your quilling projects. She is really relatable and the tone is easy to read, I read it in one day, yesterday, in about four hours. The text is very manageable to get through, and it has the perfect amount of pictures. I look forward to just owning this book and paging through the pictures over and over again to get ideas, and get inspired as I fully dip my feet into on edge quilling, which I've barely done thus far.

Who is this book for? It's for someone that has quilled for at least a little bit. The first section after the introduction is about typography, which is quite a good thing for someone beginning in quilling to do since it isn't as daunting as a large picture. But mostly this book is for someone that wants to quill pictures, though many of the tips would still work for very small works or just cards, most of her work is very large scale and to best utilize her tips and techniques, it is best if you want to at least dip your toes into making pictures.  

I hope this review was helpful and that many of you will buy her book and start making some awesome quilling pictures using her tips! At the end of the day, quilling at the scale of pictures is not hard, it just involves much care and patience, you all can do it!"

quilling,fd2s570,t3_ejxoar,1578151147.0,"This is how I organize my strips when I’m not using them.

Organizing them that way translates well to organizing them for my individual projects. The color shown here were the colors I used in my last project. I didn’t use many colors for that project, but some projects, I’ve used many! This is a recent development to my idea for using quilling strips during a project, so I’ve not used it when I have many colors. I’ve used a small dowel rod for projects before, but they weren’t hanging up, and it would hp e harder to find a color and they can get jumbled up more easily when not hanging up. I will probably have another area with another small dowel rod for more colors if I have a project with many colors.

So this setup was simple, I got a small dowel rod (I think it was just a pack with various widths), and three command hooks, and binder rings on the hooks so I can easily take an entire color off if needed. It’s important to have three, as in case you have a project with many more colors, the dowel rod can get weighted down), and three command hooks. When I’m not quilling, I can just keep the dowel rod somewhere else.

When I need to use a color, I will often take a few strips of a color, and keep in on my desk. In this way, I have just a little of each color on my desk at a time and it doesn’t get really messy. If I had a project with my colors, I would only take one at a time, or maybe just tear off exactly when I need from the strips on the binder clip.

One of my essential tools is an old card and a refillable needle nose glue bottle. I squeeze out small dab of tacky glue on the card for gluing up (I use a regular bottle of tacky glue for this) a finished strips or coil, and I use the needle nose bottle for gluing the ends of strips and coils, and for gluing inside 3D coils.

I use the scissors for cutting 3mm strips in half. For my last project, Blue Bliss, I had various multicolored coils (done by gluing together various sizes of different colors), and after gluing the colors together, I cut in half with the scissors. Then I would get two coils from the same set of colors.  This works for me because I mostly like to own and have 3mm strips, and I only have to glue various colors together once. These scissors I use have a very fine blade on them, and I find it very easy to cut 3mm strips in half.

I had only just gotten the quilling tweezers for this project, and I found them to be essential. They have a very fine point. I use them to hold a coils or finished strips when gluing (I press on my little glue puddle already described), and put it in the exact right place on my picture. For years I just used my fingers, but even if you have small fingers and are very careful, it’s much easier to get the exact right placement with quilling tweezers."

quilling,fd2hcnj,t3_ejidxz,1578147240.0,"this is great! My setup is similar. I use bigger binder clips (I find its easier to read our a strip), a dowel rod, and each binder clip is held on by a binder ring to hold each one to easily retrieve it. Having the two layers is clever, especially if you don't have closet space. My dowel rod is like six feet long, but it fits nicely in the closet. What does she do with organization with the strips she needs for a project? I posted my Quilling organization two years ago, but I'm thinking of posting what I do for each project. Basically, a scaled down version of what I do in the closet.

I also have the color name and brand hold punched in each of the binder rings so I know what color to order when it's out. How does you wife know what each color is?

Also, I hope the Quilling strips don't get any direct sunlight where they are. If they're exposed to uv light, it will eventually discolor the strips. This is why I keep mine in a closet. I learned this the hard way with one of my 3D characters fading in color from having her in a window. It's why I eventually started using uv spray on all my projects.

This is my peg of how mine basically looks from two years ago, though I have moved since then and have more colors. It definitely looks messed than this one, but I find having the strips splayed out help for getting a color when I need it https://www.reddit.com/r/quilling/comments/7lp85f/my_newly_organized_quilling_strip_storage_details/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share"

I wanted it to be completely different this time. I wanted a more limited color palette, and who doesn’t love blue.

This is made on watercolor paper, which I’ve found is essential for these densely quilled pictures as it holds the weight best and doesn’t warp. I used painters tape around the edges to create a border, and sprayed silver spray paint on it before I started.

It's how I store my Quilling strips. Keeping them like this works for me, out of the package and ready to use. As you get more and more into quilling, you'll want to buy individual colors and this was a great way I found to organize them. I also have a plastic drawers with extra packs of colors, in rainbow order. Often times I order Quilling strips and it ends up taking two weeks to get them, so always having an extra pack of all the colors I'm currently using helps a lot."
quilling,fcosw9y,t3_ehdurp,1577840648.0,"I make pictures! My pictures have gotten more ambitious and I've changed style and techniques over the years. I've about gotten my technique down for my large pictures. I actually just finished one that I've been working on for like four months a few minutes ago! I like how long they take me. I can get into a project on and off for some months, then have a wonderful complex picture I can hang up in my own home or gift.

I use watercolor paper for my pictures. It holds the weight of Quilling the best, and warps less. I then use blue tape, with some of the sticky off on my pants, making a border on my paper (just started this with this last picture). Then I ink up the paper with a nice background color. The one I just finished I used silver (some spray paint I had), and the one before that I sponged various ink colors on the paper. Watercolor could work too, but it may warp the paper more, which may not be a big deal if done carefully.

I bought larger types of watercolor paper for larger pictures. I have a large pad of watercolor paper, and even a roll if I have a super ambitious large picture (I've just used the large pad size, have yet to use the paper roll)."
