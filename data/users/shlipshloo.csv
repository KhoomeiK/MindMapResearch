PublicFreakout,ffbninv,t1_ffbn67r,1579774280.0,"It’s an emotional time. 

A person could file for divorce and then not deliver them and so doesn’t have opposition when going through the process. 

Or the recipient acts like they never got them to draw the process out.

There’s legal advantages for being the one that files from what I understand. 

Mostly I think it’s to protect all parties from a turbulent time where emotion overrides reason."

Breath_of_the_Wild,femeqve,t3_epxmc5,1579251674.0,Skyrim was like that for me and this is feeling the same way. Luckily I was way late on Skyrim and a couple years late on this.
