CBD,feh6qyl,t1_feh3j5x,1579110311.0,"It’s really going to depend on where it actually comes from. Legal “hemp” flower is just cannabis with high CBD and low THC. I buy trim from this online and make my own topicals that can also be taken orally. If you’re buying hemp oil from the scientific hemp plant, I don’t think it would have the same effects. You can buy that in the grocery store and I am willing to bet that the store sold you this at a ridiculously jacked up price"

StonerEngineering,fdswjzm,t1_fdswb1p,1578708873.0,"Bummer, would be killer if they could print in a dishwasher safe material, still cool as is but I saw a post of yours earlier in the week and that’s the first thing I thought. Just me wishing that cleaning my smoking devices could be easier to clean I guess haha"
StonerEngineering,fdsvstc,t1_fdsl2g3,1578708585.0,Could you not take it apart and put it in the dishwasher? If you do it often it wouldn’t get gross enough to get dishes gross I would think

BipolarReddit,fdia7yh,t3_eldhfz,1578438534.0,"My son just turned two. He’s amazing but parenting is hard, really hard, and when I’m not feeling well because of my BP I always think about if he will have it, or be affected negatively by it. Ultimately, it’s a very personal decision but I’m not sure if I made the right one."
