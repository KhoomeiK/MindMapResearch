knitting,fdz2hz0,t3_enfbof,1578785998.0,"Starting knitting for me was easier with single needles, not circular needles like you bought. But the process is the same either way! With circular needles you run the risk of twisting your work without even noticing it's happening, especially when you're new. I learned initially how to knit from my grandma, and then a few years passed; and when I forgot how I learned almost everything through YouTube.

Also, try using a heavier weight yarn to start out with so your work is bigger and bulkier. It makes it easier to spot your mistakes and to see where to put the needle, where to wrap the yarn, etc."
