I chose aluminum for its superior conductivity, but I was worried about the galvanic corrosion from having the aluminum coil so close to another metal. I couldn't think of the term galvanic corrosion until you mentioned it. After some reading, I realize now that using stainless over the weldable steel I normally use would actually accelerate the corrosion of the aluminum.

I'll look as adding a sacrificial anode ~~or a small electrical current to force the aluminum to be a cathode~~ as long as it does mess with the transesterification. The heat loop with be tested for leaks regularly and the heat exchanger is being designed to be easily removable in case repairs or retrofits are necessary.

As far as vehicles, non of the trucks or tractors at my farm has had major issues with biodiesel. Some stuff had older fuel pumps with natural rubber seals that dissolved over time.
