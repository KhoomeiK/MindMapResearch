WhitePeopleTwitter,ff19hli,t1_ff17nex,1579476536.0,"Couldn't think of another metal category far enough away from TRUE metal as you put it. I'm not putting down tool, fucking love me some Tool. Hell I put metalcore down far and away from TRUE metal, I just happen to really like metalcore.

Edit: I could have gone with groove metal but I forgot that even existed. 

Edit2: I don't really care for most progressive metal outside of tool. Mastadon does nothing for me personally"

Can't tell you how many times I go to a taqueria and I ask for hot sauce they give me CHOLULA. C'mon man this isn't breakfast at IHOP, where's the actual hot sauce. Quit playing games.

todayilearned,few2wt4,t1_fevwx3n,1579404708.0,"I'd wager most experienced climbers wouldn't put Everest at the top of their lists. Everest is a tourist trap, it's not the hardest mountain, it's not the most beautiful, it's just the tallest. Other peaks are much more difficult and some routes haven't even been done yet. Hell if you really want bragging rights go climb Annapurna. What's cooler? Climbing the tallest mountain that everyone does or climbing the hardest mountain? I get your points but it's a shit one.
