When you fail a drug panel, the second specimine gets sent of for GC testing to be verified positive. There is a good chance it was shipped to a lab in another state. All that being said, dont ever give information to someone who calls and prompts you. Good luck man"

todayilearned,ffr4nh3,t1_ffqk148,1580150367.0,"Exactly. That's why I imagine it's not very popular for Japanese people to have american words tattooed on their bodies. I never said america was any better, quite the contrary. I wouldn't get English tattooed on my body, or Japaneese. I'm just trying to understand the fascination with getting a Japaneese language tattooed onto one's body. Sorry if it came off harsh, I didn't mean to offend. However, I do feel like WWII was the last 'honorable' war for america, america was thrust into it by Japan. As far as raping and pillaging, unfortunately it is part of war."

The least of which was the suprise bombing of Pearl Harbor which tool the lives of 1000s of Americans. So I ask, what the fuck?"
