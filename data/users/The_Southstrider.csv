AskMen,fdh2uea,t3_elacu8,1578414180.0,"The female insistence on a minimum height has caused this phenomenon. If you're taller than she is by three or four inches, then you're decent. If she's that bent out of shape about how tall you are, then you lose nothing by being dishonest unless she comes to the data with a tape measure.

If Trump were to die as an act of aggression from Iran, it would galvanize some 60 million adults in this country into demanding excessive and indiscriminate retaliatory action to be taken against them. Remember how Lee Harvey Oswald was gunned down a day after he killed JFK? It'd be all that hatred, but focused on a country, rather than only a man."

A true nihilist wouldn't care that the mother died due to complications of childbirth, and simply accept the reality that the infant will most likely die too due to the birth defects that accompany inbreeding, and that the father would meet his fate in some Brazilian jail. You'd chalk this whole scenario up to just being a part of the human experience, shrug your shoulders and move along with your day. 

Having a desire for justice due to this event - thus valuing the human life of the victim - would indicate that you aren't a nihilist.
