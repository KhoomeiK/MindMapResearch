I woke up thinking it was weird I was getting up then as it had to have been later then I normally would. As I was walking into the living room I thought how weirdly quiet and yet normal it was. Then I saw my sister and my parents staring horrified at the tv screen, as I walked into the room and in front of the TV they replayed the 2and plane hitting the WTC. 

Eventually we got ready and went to school. It's all anyone talked about that day. One girl in our class, her dad was in NYC as a pilot and should have been heading home that morning, she was a mess. I remember late in the afternoon when over the intercom they called into the room and said ""teacher, please send student up, her dad is on the line"" we gasped, she sprinted to the office and our teacher silently wept at her desk. When she came back she was crying but saying he was ok, we were all relieved. 

There was alot of discussions about what this meant and why it could have happened. We were a small private school so our teacher allowed us to just be that day. They knew that this was a big event that would be a pinpoint in our history one day. At lunch for al grades above 4th, they wheeled in a tv and played cnn
