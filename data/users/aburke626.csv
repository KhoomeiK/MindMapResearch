Where I grew up we had this hyper-regional slang where “to knock up for” meant “to go knock on someone’s door and see if they could come out to play” - this was way before cell phones. Everyone else thinks it’s bizarre, even a lot of our parents. But clearly, it came from somewhere! WE ARE VINDICATED!"
aww,fgi2fnv,t3_eyjqls,1580802433.0,This made me tear up! That dog wanted to get out of there and go home!
AnimalsBeingBros,fgi21gt,t3_eym1oa,1580801944.0,It’s like the Blair Witch version of a Disney movie.
antiMLM,fghvzwx,t1_fgh8jap,1580795555.0,"That’s what I hate most about this. Not only is there no “sludge” in your intestines, if there is anything in there, the only way to ger rid of it is to poop it out. Unless you want a bowel perf and want to be septic or something and want it to go into your body, it’s gotta come out your butt."
BeautyGuruChatter,fgem6b1,t1_fgeh8rq,1580703004.0,"Lavender is also a neurotoxin to cats, and I’m pretty sure lemon isn’t good. I don’t know about the others but i would research first."
pointlesslygendered,fgek91o,t1_fgedqou,1580701543.0,"I keep switching around, that seems to help keep it effective. I like dove’s 48 hour advanced care, the secret clinical strength. 

However, I really have been trying to use more natural stuff but I hate almost all natural deodorants. They either smell horrific, don’t work, or irritate me. I’ve been using Schmidt’s for a week or so and I actually really like it, which is super rare. It works and doesn’t irritate me. I bought a little sample one so I’ll actually buy a full size one and see how it holds up.

I’m exactly the same - I sweat a good amount but not in a way I think is excessive, just not a delicate flower."
pointlesslygendered,fgcz4qr,t1_fgcmh95,1580677488.0,Yes.
pointlesslygendered,fg8fhh5,t1_fg8esgb,1580617943.0,"That depends on what kind of deodorant you’re using. Men’s deodorant generally has more aluminum ingredients. “Ph-balanced” deodorants have other ingredients, usually alkalizing. However, being more acidic is actually more hostile to bacteria so YMMV."
pointlesslygendered,fg8emvo,t1_fg8a4m0,1580617242.0,"Uhhh no idea. Generic man deodorant? I think they often have the same active ingredient but MUCH more of it. Like, women get ripped off with “prescription strength” deodorant and should just buy some men’s stuff."
pointlesslygendered,fg7vxfh,t3_exer9z,1580602826.0,"I have to say that men’s deodorant is generally WAY stronger. Any time I’ve had to use a boyfriend’s deodorant, I seem to have freakishly bone-dry armpits for days, and it’s hard to wash off. (And I use fairly strong women’s deodorant)."
bestoflegaladvice,fg5q704,t1_fg5d1j5,1580534933.0,"That’s what I think, because if the issue were that Eugene were shitting in the yard, it would be very different."
beauty,fg22c68,t1_fg1x8dj,1580436837.0,"Lush makes a very similar one that comes in a larger size, lemony flutter cuticle butter, I LOVE it."
