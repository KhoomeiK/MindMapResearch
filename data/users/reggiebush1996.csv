depression,ff6a5tg,t3_erwll3,1579622705.0,Why do you cry? What is making you feel so crappy? I’m going through the same thing. Hate being sad constantly.

BreakUps,ff5rbqc,t3_erthkz,1579607191.0,"I can understand. Must hurt more because you see her physically moving on. If she can move on that quickly to someone else, was it meant to be? I say just tell her how you feel! Even if you have to write it out. I made a mistake and now I’m living with the consequence, he doesn’t want to talk he wants space.  I’m just waiting, hoping he reaches out. If I gave him space when he asked it would of been better than now."
AskReddit,ff5nu2z,t3_erspx6,1579602300.0,"I’m a horrible drunk. Messed stuff up with my boyfriend. He needs space I didn’t give it to him at first, now I’m just patiently waiting for him trying to not go crazy as I already am. We’re suppose to be leaving on vacation Sunday but I don’t think he’s coming. I’m not reaching out because he needs space. I’m messed up rn."

BreakUps,ff5i4km,t1_ff5hyqh,1579593924.0,"Yeah, not much else to do. I deactivated my social media because I’d have the urge to creep his sexy face and try to message him lol. I just hope I have a miracle in store and this year turns around. Been the worst year of my life so far. Yeah.. never felt this pain in my life."
BreakUps,ff5hwfs,t1_ff5hokn,1579593626.0,"Yes I’m using this time to focus on me. Which is what he wants.. I became too crazy, too clingy and then I made a high mistake and we have a fight. He wanted space due to my mistake, which is 100% my fault. I own up to my actions, if I gave him the space he wanted a month ago instead of texting him, calling him, emailing him then he even told my cousin that he would of been coming. But I didn’t respect it a month ago.. it’s been 3 days and it’s the hardest thing in my life. He told me he’s hurting but I’m just trying to distract myself as much as I can"
BreakUps,ff5heu4,t1_ff5hbfq,1579592987.0,"I hope so too. I so badly want to call him, go see him and bother the shit out of him to show him how much I care and love him. But he needs this and he needs to see that I can do this. I need to show him I can listen to what he wants and respect it. Because I didn’t before. Praying and hoping for a miracle. We’re suppose to leave for vacation Sunday but I’m lost as to if he’s coming or not. I’m not going to reach out. I’m going to be strong even though he knows I’m so down and sad and miserable right now."
AskReddit,ff5h4rr,t3_errcik,1579592630.0,16. I don’t regret it because I loved that guy. I do regret it on other hand because I wish I saved it and sold it like that girl did recently for 1.3 mil LOL JOKES.
AskReddit,ff5h2c5,t3_errcwi,1579592544.0,How I been living. In bed all day everyday crying or Netflix. Then I go to work and cry there for 8 hours. Somewhat sleep in between
BreakUps,ff5gtzb,t1_ff5gs8n,1579592257.0,"Yeah I’ve literally been having to take tons of sleeping pills. I ruined it by not giving him time when he asked, but now I respect the decision. I have to wait :( he’s my one."
BreakUps,ff5gp7o,t1_ff5gb86,1579592088.0,"100% agree. All I do is think about the situation. I work nights so I’m alone, that’s when it hits the most. I sleep most of the day then go to the gym. I find that helps but I struggle."

AskReddit,ff2tolu,t1_ff2t8q6,1579523726.0,I’m going mental I miss him so much. He needs space and I have to respect that. Killing me
AskReddit,ff2tkxd,t1_ff2t8q6,1579523604.0,"I just smiled while thinking of what to put first :) he’s everything I want in a man. Just been missing him like crazy. He’s sexy, short, funny, perfect smile, adorable and my whole world. I messed up and made a mistake. He needed time for himself but I’m stupid and didn’t give him that at first which made it worse.. We have been together for 5 years. We’re suppose to go on vacation in 4 days but I don’t even know if he’s coming anymore. I miss him. I love him. If I listened and gave him the space we would be back together but I didn’t so now I’m just waiting and trying not to rip out my heart while doing so."
AskReddit,ff2suni,t3_erchz5,1579522695.0,All thought about him :(
depression,ff2rycx,t1_ff2r8lt,1579521506.0,"All I have left is to wait.. I’m so unhappy right now it’s not ok and I don’t know what else to do. I cry constantly, I can’t eat, I can’t sleep.. been up on and off for 12 days, struggling to work and talk. It’s not fair I leave my happiness in him, but in reality I messed up. It’s my fault.. he never did anything wrong. He does need to see that I can do things on my own. I’m so damn sad. I just want to go back to the way things were.. all I have to do is wait. It’s just killing me to see he doesn’t want to talk or see me, also because he’s hurt. I’ve never felt this. I’m so scared and broken. My heart is literally in a million pieces on the floor."
depression,ff2p0bi,t3_erbopz,1579517197.0,Exactly how I’m going to feel after finishing this night shift in 2 hours. Wondering if it ever gets better.
depression,ff2mvri,t1_ff2mtgk,1579513908.0,"I’ve written letters, constantly messaged him, gone to see him, talked in person. He doesn’t want to talk to me anymore, to the point when I message he says stop. He told me he’s hurting but the more I approach the more I push him. I want to respect his decision by wanting space, by showing him I listen and I can actually do it. I so badly want to call him and text him. Been 2 full days since we talked and I’m going nuts."
