relationship_advice,ffe9mny,t3_et58x9,1579840520.0,"It seems like you used him while you needed support with your Dad. Now that he’s gone, you took the first opportunity to get rid of the guy. Of course, everyone is gonna take his side. You’ve done a lot of wrongs and he’s been patient. Now, he stands “close” to a girl in a picture or maybe it was something he didn’t even notice that looked weird and you just dump him?! Uhh... dick move much? 

If it’s what you wanted, then fine. But that’s how it looked to everyone else."

Nah, bad joke. They could find some more medical/psychological help or try to stop enabling his behavior. I know very few cases of autism. But there’s this boy that’s almost a teen and he’s got two types of grandparents. 

On his Dad’s side, they baby him and he gets his way every time. He won’t eat anything that’s not chicken nuggets. He’ll yell at and hit his mom. However, from his Mom’s side, grandparents treat him as they would treat any other grandkid. No babying, telling him to respect his mom. If they cook, they tell him “This is what I made to eat. If you don’t want it, you don’t eat.” He’ll eat whatever ‘cause they know he likes the food and has eaten it before, and he knows his tantrums will not be tolerated. 

I think OP’s brother is purely spoiled, which only gets enhanced by the autism, or viceversa. Whatever. 

Good luck, OP!"

Adulting,ff7pn5w,t1_ff7o8n2,1579655292.0,"Omg. Thank you for you honesty, your rant and everything you mentioned. 

It does feel like waiting for something else. If I don’t want to have kids, what am I actually waiting for? I feel like this is as good as it gets. Just waiting to grow older, sicker, and eventually die. It’s depressing I know. But right now, it’s like I don’t *NEED* anything. So, what now?

You make a great point about our brains being sort of “bored”. Everything is just too easy."

Thanks for your advice, and taking some of your time to reply to me."
