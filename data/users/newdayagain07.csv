todayilearned,ffkj3wp,t1_ffkhnki,1580023606.0,"well. now i'm confused. i believe what is happening is YOU are the one with horrid reading comprehension since you seem to have gotten angry when i agreed with you. 

what is obvious is you probably have no friends and so small things can make you angry. you barely have anything in the real world to worry about. this is really sad and pathetic. i'm so sorry."
todayilearned,ffkgnap,t1_ffke8kh,1580022444.0,"700k for only 43m plays is actually a shit ton of money considering people mainly watch youtube videos once and they're much longer. getting 40m views on youtube is probably only like 10k dollars or something and that's like hours of footage.

edit: i decided to explain reading comprehension for some of you angry retards out there. you see, the way it works in the adult world is, writing isn't always clear and compartmentalize for you. you need to learn how to understand when someone isn't explicitly stating everything. from the top, we have the title about pandora right? then calleca explained the payout breakdown. ok, so now obviously the 700k value i mentioned is about pandora. i'm sorry i didnt explicitly transition when i compared it to youtube. it should've been obvious  that it was a comparison between youtube and pandora. yes i got the youtube payout value wrong, still the message is the same. the true youtube payout is around 100k for 40m views. still significantly less than for music on pandora. most youtube videos are watched only once, meanwhile music can be listened to 100s of times. so youtube producers are creating longer videos and have to draw more unique visitors than song producers but song producers are getting a much larger payout. yes producing music is harder, and that's why their compensation is higher."

please please pleaseee for the love of fucking god take your own advice here. regardless of how you feel about what is lawful, dont ride like an asshole because it will get you killed. tell your riding friends that too. 


> The lane width is not designed for drivers to be able to drift in their lanes, it is to accommodate the varying widths of different vehicles. 

lol yes it is. you think it's possible for people to never drift? yes the lanes are much larger than necessary for drift but if you actually think lanes arent spaced for drifting then you're lying to yourself.

>Actively taking action that would lead to a collision is against the law and unsafe for all involved. 

yes like forcing your way through a tight space out of spite like the guy in the video. 

>You should always be aware of your surroundings, motorcycle or car.

lol no shit? that's why you dont hear of people running over bikes splitting lanes all the time. although it does happen. the hilarious irony of bicyclists and motorcyclists trying to put the onus on drivers but then not driving defensively themselves then crying a river when accidents happen.

>You should always be in full control of your vehicle.

no shit? that's not the same as never drifting. lanes arent straight forever. nobody can maintain 100% attention 100% of the time. expecting cars to do it then motorcycles can ride like assholes is seriously the MOST motorcyclish thing i've ever heard. why do you think op tried to slip in an opening that made him hit his side view mirror? it's not because motorcyclists arent assholes.

>Paramount above all, you should know the basic traffic laws in any area your driving in.

no shit. i never said the contrary. stop making shit up to help your argument."

also are you idiots seriously unaware of why people don't like it when you split? they now have to be extremely careful and vigilante as to not drift over even an inch when there's a bike around. i'm sure you've driven cars before. you know how annoyed it is to have to do that. i can appreciate you splitting in bumper to bumper traffic but when the flow of traffic is going that fast? fuck you. people want to know that they can drift in their own lane without causing an accident. the least you can do is appreciate how annoying it is and not act so entitled about it."
