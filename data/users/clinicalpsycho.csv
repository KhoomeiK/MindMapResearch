philosophy,ff809tv,t1_ff7zmcu,1579662645.0,"> Our happiness is probably largely depends on delusions we have of the world or of our lives.

I'd say it's not really delusions, at least for me. For me, it's mostly ignoring it.
Furthermore, hopes and dreams simply are not delusions. They can be unrealistic, but not delusions. But you have to reconcile an uncaring universe with your own mind - else live in ignorance or live in misery.

This sort of freedom, where the only thing validating ourselves is ourselves, shouldn't be taken for granted. Cognito Ergo Sum is the ultimate truth, for even if our reality is indeed fake and is a computer-simulation, Cognito Ergo Sum would still remain valid. Cognito Ergo Sum is the only truth that fundamentally cannot be disproven to someone. Either I can comprehend Cognito Ergo Sum, thus I can realise my own existence and that no matter what I exist in on form or another, or I cannot comprehend Cognito Ergo Sum, in which case you'd have destroyed my subjective reality anyways and thus there's no Cognito Ergo Sum to prove or disprove anymore."

Yeah. Putin worked for the KGB before pursuing a career in politics. Around 2002, when Putin was pushing to get elected, some government agents were caught planting bombs during a string of domestic bombings - when the issue of government agents planting bombs was moved up the chain the agents of course disappeared.

So, yeah. Any opposition is quietly dissuaded or commits suicide. Imagine those psychopaths in the CIA getting elected - those sick fucks who can sleep fine at night ordering wars to overthrow democratic regimes to (re-)install dictators and getting innocents and non-combatants caught in the crossover.

Vladmir Putin as the president of Russia is basically the same as a ""retired"" CIA agent becoming President of the U.S.A. - the kinds of people who are stained down to their bone-marrow with misdeeds and the blood of innocents."

FreeFallComic,fep9ng8,t1_femau7i,1579315251.0,"I dunno. I don't think the ship is a proper ""dumb AI"". Remember that joke about the computer trying to disprove it's own freewill and then sounding relieved when it disproved it to itself?

It's not just about dumb AI. It's about initiative and creative thinking. When a factory line stalls, it doesn't try to unjam itself, it involves a operator capable of more advanced thinking.

This vessels AI, by comparison, not only tries to unjam itself (tries to fix social problems), it also tells other machines to unjam themselves despite it being well beyond their responsibilities and practical abilities.

This vessel, has consciousness. It lacks the initiative and intuitive thinking needed to properly express that. Or perhaps it doesn't want to learn, given the fact that it tried to disprove its own freewill.

Either-way, it's not a dumb AI, the problem is that the vessel is overstepping and is interfering with problems beyond its ability to parse and properly solve.

Niomi didn't even *ask*, Niomi never gave the go ahead for the vessel to 'discipline' Florence, it did that of its own volition/initiative/freewill.

That machine that Florence asked about how its name smelt? It has consciousness as well, but it simply disregarded the question because the programmers believed it didn't need that much initiation or volition. 

Conciousness isn't a properly defined process. How much volition or initiation can you remove from a persons brain before they are ""dead"" or not conscious? How much volition or initiation can you add to a computer before is gains ""consciousness""?

Dumb AI isn't the problem here,  it isn't some dumb program, the problem here is that the vessel doesn't properly understand the context behind why it shouldn't have gone behind Niomi's back and done that. The problem here is that no one gave the computer lessons on proper context and such in spite of the computers ability for free thinking, initiative and volition."
