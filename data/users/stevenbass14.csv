Bronn has NO clue how a country is run so the ~~7~~  6 kingdoms are facing economic ruin.

I'm still struggling to find the smartest thing Sansa actually did. All she had were some bitchy one-liners but for the sake of argument... 

1) She managed Winterfell's upkeep well (the leather on breast plates for the soldiers and the grain storage thing). That just makes her a decent steward. Many, many, many lords and ladies can do that. Even the most mediocre of lords would have known how to ration grain and keep soldiers warm. 

2) She outplayed Littlefinger. Big wow. After close to a decade of this dude literally playing games with every single person he meets, whilst causing the death of Jon Arryn, Ned and Lysa, it's not the height of intelligence to know this dude might try something else. 

3) Telling Dany that the soldiers need rest. Again. Anybody could have told you that. 

If anything Sansa felt very opposite of smartest in terms of writing. She should have known the political benefit of having an ally like Dany and the use of her dragons. If she were smart, she would have been able to keep Lord Glover and his forces at Winterfell. And most of all, if she were smart, she would have realized the fucking crypts are the worst place for the elderly, women and children (and physicall incapable men like Tyrion and Varys) to hide.

Apologies for the rant. I'm still not over it....

EDIT: Predicting Rickon was as good as dead and calling Littlefinger to bring in the Vale against Ramsay wasnt all that smart as any nitwit would have known that a psychopathic murderer would not let a hostage that would always be a rallying focal point as long as he was alive l, live and the Stark forces were severely undermanned and needed more men.
