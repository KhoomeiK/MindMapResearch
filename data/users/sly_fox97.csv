And ever since that witch cursed me for kicking her cat I've had this song dance around in my head. She never actually *proved* she was a witch and inherently I'm not a superstitious person, but why take the chance? I'm only twenty-two and according to her crass poem I'm to be dead soon. Real soon. 

Me being the smart ass I am decided that form this point on I would never where the color red. No red shirt, cap, pants or shoes. Not even the trimming's were red. Still, the song continued it's dance. *Just don't wear red. You have nothing to worry about!*

Today when I awoke from bed I decided to put on my white T shirt with my black slim fit jeans and gray converse. It was the weekend and I figured what better way to spend it then by talking a walk through the city. I'm no tourist, always had been a local, but I hadn't actually been to the empire building since I was five or six for a school trip. I fed my cat for the last time and walked out my apartment complex.

The city was it's usual self on a Saturday in mid may. The weather was finally warmed up from the frigid winter prior and the traffic between cars and pedestrians was  monumental. Have you ever kicked the top of an anthill down? That's what it looked like from above I'd imagine. 

I looked past and through the stores windows to have candy for my eyes as I walked. The sky was Bright blue and cloudless and even for the city that never sleeps, everyone seemed in a great mood. I had stopped to admire a bird land on an electric wire. As my eyes followed I saw a man painting the side of a building from his scaffolds. We noticed each others eye-contact and I gave a head nod that said, ""Ey boss man how's it going?"" He returned the gesture with a shrug that said, ""Works work, but damn is today nice!"" That's when I took notice of a young boy who looked to be between ten and twelve. He was weaving effortlessly with his skateboard as he parted the sea waters of the crowd. Some had cursed, some smiled and one even rose a full fist in the air. The kid was quick and like most preteens, reckless.

As the child rocketed past me I saw the final moments transpire as if time got fashioned into a jell-o mold. He went to cross the busy street, choosing to turn as soon as the walk light flicked **WALK.** Without looking, the boy had begun to ride to his sure death. In a moment of unflinching thought I lunged forward to throw my body over the boy, knocking the painter off the scaffold as I dove. Slowly, little dots and splashes of red filled my vision as my white T began soaked in the thick red paint and the even thicker blood. The boy was safe. That was all that mattered now."
