Watercolor,ff717vr,t3_erxe7y,1579639092.0,Beautiful!!
Dogtraining,ff51uf1,t3_erk5gp,1579577949.0,I solved this problem by getting a Bobby whistle like the constabulary used to use in England. They're very loud! At 1st I just blew it in the house and fed him chicken I did that for a couple of weeks. He either got chicken or cheese every time I blew the whistle. Then when he was in the far far back of the yard and presumably couldn't hear me making the call sound I blew the whistle and he comes running as fast as he can every single time... keep reinforcing that whistle as a wonderful call for something wonderful
Dogtraining,ff51etu,t3_erlspz,1579577627.0,"Do they switch off being on the bottom? If they take turns being predator or prey, it's normal. If one puppy is always getting tromped on and struggling to get away, I would intervene and enforce a break."

Dogtraining,ff3tvpl,t3_erff2h,1579548744.0,"Here is more detail on how to get her to LOVE the muzzle It's called counter conditioning. Counter conditioning is slow but effective. I used it to help my dog overcome the fear of having his nails clipped. Just substitute ""muzzel"" for ""dremmel"". I accidentally clipped too close and thereafter my puppy was terrified, as is your dog. I introduced the dremmel at a distance that evoked no fear reaction while feeding steady flow of roasted chicken....for about two minutes. Then turn off the dremmel and hide the dremmel and the chicken. After a minute, I turned on the dremmel and presented it, then I brought the chicken back around. The dog gets that when the scary object appears, wonderful chicken appears and when the scary object disappears, the chicken disappears. I took a month to do this twice a day for about 7-10 minutes, moving the dremmel closer and closer only if he had no reaction to it until I could touch one nail. Then I had my husband take over and feed chicken while I dremmeled one nail only. He accepted that so the next day I did two nails. Then I did them all. Basically you teach them to love and welcome the thing they fear. You have to back off the minute they show fear (which looks like aggression which is a warning) or it could escalate. Now my dog excitedly runs to the chair, jumps in it and presents his paws. In 5 minutes we are done. It was worth the effort we put into it. I second the statement some puppies go through a fear period.  Human babies do as well. It's called stranger anxiety and occurs because the brain has developed enough to recognize ""not the mom"" faces. Maybe ease up on exposure until your pup is older. Work on building confidence.  Best wishes"
Dogtraining,ff3s6ar,t3_ergtvb,1579547694.0,"I've had a harness come unclipped. It seems to be the only one he cant chew through. I use two safety clips to clip the harness to his collar as safety back up. You could also use counter-conditioning for your Houdini. It can be applied to anything your dog doesn't like but needs. Counter conditioning is slow but effective. I used it for clipping nails after I cut one too short. I switched to the dremmel: totally new sound and object.  I introduced the dremmel at a distance that evoked no fear reaction while feeding steady flow of roasted chicken....for about two minutes. Then turned off the dremmel and hid the dremmel and the chicken. After a minute, i turned on the dremmel and presented it, then brought the chicken back around.

Then I had my husband take over and feed chicken while I dremmeled one nail only. He accepted that so the next day I did two nails. Then I did them all. Basically you teach them to love and welcome the thing they fear or dislike. You have to back off the minute they show a negative reaction. Now my dog excitedly runs to the chair, jumps in it and presents his paws. In 5 minutes we are done. It was worth the effort we put into it. You might get that totally new harness someone recommended and slowly work your way up to putting it on for a few minutes. Then build in tolerance for duration. I'm sure it will work if you're very patient over time. Also try a new setting from the usual setting for putting g on the harness. When he has it, I'd still use the back up safety clips in case he relapses. Best wishes!"

Dogtraining,fefpnlq,t3_eowv4e,1579061681.0,"You make yourself more interesting than what he's pulling to. You can do two things: build a strong bond of love by gentleness and meeting needs ( which punishment will destroy) and have high value treats when you walk that your dig gets a steady flow of when walking right by your side. My pup was a puller (a Samoyed who can easily pull 500 pounds) and after 3-4 months of steady treats for walking by my side and sniffing breaks as a reward, he no longer needs treats to walk on a loose leash or heel. Also, get a front clip harness like the Easy Walk harness...it made a big difference. Finally, make sure your dog gets to run off energy in a safe open space like a dog park which is an important daily need."

Dogtraining,fdyddei,t3_enckog,1578778561.0,"He is bored. Mine did this whenever we were out of the room. We traded up and all that did was reward him for getting an object and generally waiting for his reward. NOTHING was safe. Three pair of eye glasses, a tv remote, two cell phones, books, frames off shelves, a quart jar, candles, dish rags, a favorite large basket later I've decided to give him a time out for any object that is not his. We've kept all doors shut, put objects like mail we want to take out up high and hung eyeglasses on chains hung on lamps to no avail: he gets more creative. When he stole a second basket today I began the time outs in his crate. He has many chew toys, plenty of exercise and love but he thinks it's fun. He is 16 months now and is slowing down a bit now so maturity is part of it. Work on drop it hard core. Good luck"

Dogtraining,fdpejlc,t3_emg7d6,1578626597.0,One additional point besides what others have said: if you have anxiety you can be sure your dog knows it and you feed each other's anxiety in a reinforcing cycle. Any help you can get to lower your anxiety will help your dog calm down and be less protective of you both. I hope things work out for you.

The only adolescent problem we had was that he acted like he had no clue what sit meant and came when he felt like it, where he had been doing those flawlessly for months. We strengthened the rewards and persisted. Today he graduated from Advanced class. Adolescence isn't that bad, don't fear it. The best strategy is to meet every need consistently and persist in training.  I think you've just got a great dog, congratulations!"

We gave our grieving animals a homeopathic remedy called ignatia and it stopped the constant howling and restless pacing. I'm sure your mother loved him and they had a bond. You could not have a bond based on love yet. Your circumstances are different but i had a hard headed puppy who demand barked, jumped on us and tore our clothes when we turned our backs to be boring. Warnings may confuse the issue. I immediately put him in his crate every single time he did that. After he quit yelling in protest, I counted to 20, praised him for quiet and gave him the love and attention he was seeking. It took 3 days of 6-7 time outs a day and the behavior ceased. If he relapsed, all I had to say was ""you want a time out?""  He would run for a toy or a chew stick which we praised.  I believe a consistently response done without anger but gently is best. He learns it a behavior that never works and chooses a behavior that gets his need met. Your dog needs love, comfort and reassurance as much as he needs limits. I wish you the best"

Freeze dried pumpkin, a good probiotic, rice and chicken during bouts of diarrhea helped. Then he got Giradia...check for that if your vet has not already done so.
