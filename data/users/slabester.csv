ChoosingBeggars,ff4yzs1,t1_ff3zvy5,1579575853.0,I worked at an Italian fast food chain (probably obvious from the description where) and had an awesome manager. My boyfriend of only a couple months at the time lost his sister tragically and unexpectly. I found out at work and my manager told me to leave right away and not worry about work. Then he got all my shifts covered for a week so I could attend the funeral in a different state. Obviously that's not a common experience but damm did it build loyalty. I wish more managers of minimum wage employees treated their staff that way.
aww,fepjf1j,t1_feph415,1579322045.0,It's been 18 years and I still cry when I think of him. It never really goes away but it hurts less and the good memories take over.
aww,fepj22y,t1_fepft5p,1579321776.0,"I'm so sorry. That is the worst feeling holding them as they pass, but it's the best send off you can give."

We shouldn't shame someone for mocking a trait the other can't control by mocking traits the bully can't control. Shame the initial bully for sure, but for things they did wrong specifically. Shame their moral failings."
pics,fephx8h,t1_fepel70,1579320941.0,Nope. She mocked his appearance so we must mock her appearance to show that mocking someone's appearance is wrong!
pics,fephejs,t1_fep6g8d,1579320555.0,"For her lack of moral fiber, yes. But not her appearance. How people look is not a reflection of their shittiness; their behavior is."
aldi,fehgpwu,t3_ep5l51,1579116183.0,I love this stuff!

pics,fdpjbm9,t1_fdpgk6v,1578630174.0,"She was seen as the attainable girl next door, probably in part due to have a ""flaw""."

crochet,fdphicz,t3_emiyym,1578628772.0,So lovely! Congratulations!
crochet,fdiyqyr,t1_fdiem8x,1578454128.0,"I came here to post this first sentence, capitalization and everything! They are AMAZING."
crochet,fdiygyc,t1_fdisr12,1578453937.0,That pattern is gorgeous but holy hell that sounds like a nightmare!
crochet,fdfge9g,t1_fdcjeyp,1578361084.0,"Oh also, it just occurred to me that I didn't use the pattern's belly band. I crocheted an oval until it looked big enough. It may have just been me but the one I made from the pattern look too thin."
aww,fdcrpll,t1_fdcmlh6,1578282415.0,"You should step in, do it better and bring people more joy then. If you can't, fuck off."
aww,fdcrjmz,t1_fdckaus,1578282289.0,You're cringe.
crochet,fdcpvgb,t1_fdcjeyp,1578281049.0,"I had the hardest time with the muzzle! I used a larger hook (I want to say a 4.5mm) and stuffed it between the face and muzzle. At first, it look really weird but it looked more ""right"" when I added the stuffing behind it and sewed on the features. The muzzle looked way too small before that.

Congratulations on your upcoming nibling! üòä"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdawfpv,t1_fda3rl2,1578251144.0,That is so sad. What disgusting people.

I redid his stomach trying to get it straight four times till I gave up and settled for lopsided. But all around, I'm pleased with the results!"
AmItheAsshole,fciu20d,t1_fch2sik,1577669812.0,"I'm guessing she looked amazing in the jumpsuit and the girls were jealous. She needs to keep it and wear it any time the opportunity presents itself. I do second that it's a shame she can't return the gift. What an awful ""friend""."
aldi,fc1wb62,t1_fc1ttce,1577331697.0,That's adorable!
BikiniBottomTwitter,fc1rbq0,t1_fc19jae,1577327251.0,You bet it is!
BikiniBottomTwitter,fc1rafk,t1_fc19me8,1577327220.0,Your friends aren't as cool as you.
BikiniBottomTwitter,fc15qw0,t1_fc11l9j,1577309034.0,My all time favorite is Band Geeks by a significant margin. Bubble Buddy is probably second and Graveyard shift is definitely top five.
shortscarystories,fbtdkxo,t1_fbt9zn2,1577075390.0,I'm so sorry for your loss. ‚ù§
