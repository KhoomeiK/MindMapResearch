formula1,ff59jan,t1_ff4lrli,1579584325.0,"Your first paragraph is rather taking things out of context and singling out Ocon for the sake of argument. More often than not a midfield team will not fight a top 3 team as ultimately they are not fighting them for position and just ruins both their strategies. And also more often than not a sister/B-team has gotten way out of the way for the A team. Perez has parked his car for the Mercs too, and so did the TRs for RB, and iirc even Haas has for Ferrari. This is no different from team orders, which some don't mind, some hate, and many drivers have done."
