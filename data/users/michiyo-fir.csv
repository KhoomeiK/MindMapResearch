UBC,ff2cnoj,t1_ff22s4u,1579500846.0,"Hmm I remember when I was a TA one of my students had a broken arm and access and diversity arranged for her exam to be on a laptop since she couldn’t write with her dominant hand.  I invigilated the entire exam in one of the offices in our building, that’s why I thought maybe they accommodate for injuries.  But this was over 4 years ago and I never asked the student regarding her condition so I don’t know if she was already an A&D client with an additional injury or not."
UBC,ff154ul,t1_ff0o0cv,1579475307.0,I believe you can ask for help at access and diversity.  I don’t know if short term injuries are included but they can often provide note takers and have you do exams on a computer or even get someone to type it out for on your behalf.

I usually load up on these when I’m really sick and I find it helps a lot with the quality of sleep, plus most of the cough/décongestion medication makes you sleepy anyways leading to better rest. 

If you’re on campus talk to Malcolm at the UBC Save on pharmacy, he’s really kind and helpful and suggested specific cough/congestion meds for me when I was super sick."

UBC,feldy4o,t1_fekma7p,1579219920.0,"It's not as simple as that since most union staff do not have the work from home clause in the union regulations.

If the university curtails non-essential services then we get the day off paid, if they don't we have to show up or take a vacation day.

Other groups such as Management and Professional are allowed to work from home once in a while.  For those people, they were encouraged not to come in."

But that means for those that live far, 2-3 hours were already spent on commute to the campus and after an hour people had to spend another 2-3 hours commuting back.  Bad decision by the university in my opinion."

UBC,fd6f8oo,t3_ek56aq,1578190081.0,"I regret going to UBC as my bachelor’s degree.  At the time I had the choice of UBC, Toronto and McGill and I was strongly considering the other two, however, my mom persuaded me to go to UBC because 1. We already live in Vancouver so no need to pay for residence, 2. I would be close to home/family. 

However, after almost completing my degree, I learnt that generally if I wanted to stay in my field and do my masters and PhD, it is strongly beneficial to attend at least two major schools in different areas (preferably different countries but east vs west coast is still somewhat acceptable). If I had done my bachelor’s elsewhere, I would have been able to come back to UBC for my master’s or PhD and hopefully settled back in Vancouver. 

If I continue all three degrees in the same university, career prospects are abysmal and in the end, since I didn’t want to move away from Vancouver at this point (7 years after starting my bachelor’s) I decided not to continue to a PhD for the time being.  Especially considering that when I was around 20, I had way less responsibilities and now at almost 30, I have pets, a partner, job, etc and it is becoming too difficult for me to consider moving away."

relationship_advice,fcvv6rn,t3_ej3aq7,1578010834.0,"Depends on the culture.  According to my mom (Chinese from China), that is a normal expectation of men in mainland China.  This is what my dad did for my mom as well and I asked him how he felt about it, to which he replied it's normal and he sees it as his duty to do so if he is able.  Of course, this is an out-dated view and many people in China now don't follow these ideals.  However, it is still prevalent according to my parents in Chinese culture/populations, especially in the older generation.

Edit: Of course if you didn't know that was what she intended to begin with, you don't have to accept it as I think this is something I think should be discussed ahead of time.  You can let her know your view and discuss with her, but if she doesn't agree to compromise, the relationship is not going to work out."

chefknives,fcsit2f,t1_fcsi88u,1577917314.0,I just don’t like the look.  Most of my family are Asian and comment on my “dirty” knives when I try to prepare meals for them.  They especially like to comment on my super expensive knives that end up getting “dirty/filthy” easily and don’t really approve of my carbon knife collection.  I think it’s an Asian cultural thing that associates patina with uncleanliness.  I made another post under this thread on another comment about keeping knives free of patina (sign of dirtiness) as explained to me by a sushi chef that’s a family friend.
chefknives,fcsi176,t1_fcsgxu1,1577916895.0,"I actually usually use washing soda on the knives to keep the patina off.  Was taught this by a sushi chef friend of my family’s in Japan.  He told me it is very common for sushi chefs (mostly carbon knives) to use soda or a rust eraser on their knives on a regular basis because in Japan chefs need to keep their knives shiny to show their customers that their practice is “clean.”  Especially for sushi chefs since many slice fish at the sushi bar right in front of customers.  He mentioned that patina isn’t seen as acceptable since most patrons don’t know anything about knives and would feel that the chef is cutting fish with a “dirty” tool.

For me, I just don’t like the patina look and I thought I would try it on the edge of a few of my knives that I haven’t kept super clean before taking it to my Kramer carbon or other non-clad carbon knives.  

Someone else suggested I refinish they knife with sandpaper so I will probably try that first.   In the future I will stick to using washing soda and take my time with it.  This time I got impatient since the soda was going so slow and I took the eraser to it since it seemed to be working much faster.
