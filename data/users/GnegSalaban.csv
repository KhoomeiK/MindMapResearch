todayilearned,fdnnau5,t1_fdnlb84,1578589351.0,I essentially self disassociated 4 years ago (requested to be removed from the organization) from the JWs once it was clear those who I considered friends and family were anything but that and that they were trying to further discredit and villainize my name. I've made my own new network of friends and family that I own. The JWs won't steal anything else from me.
todayilearned,fdnmrs6,t1_fdnln6q,1578589042.0,"That is part of the truth, however there is another reason for why they essentially talk down any external exposure with ""worldly ones"". The main reason is to minimize and downplay and contrary or critical though of the organization. Sort of a memory hole, if you will. Its very much so as if you are living in a different world. It's brainwashing. Think North Korea and how the population is kept in a bubble. Constantly lied to with no room to question or debate."
