depression,ff8grpk,t3_cml6ni,1579677781.0,"Dear diary, I'm slowly drifting away and can't seem to find a way out. I just want everything to fall into place but I can't seem to understand how to live normally. I will have to go back to society, but I don't want to live working for the rest of my life with no meaning. I don't know, I just feel like I can't keep myself together and I just want to break. But I will try to move forward, even if a disaster awaits me..."
selfimprovement,ff0gq0p,t3_er0o74,1579468708.0,"For me, I think it could be a loss of interest in life. Meaning it goes along the subconscious lines of it's not worth remembering, what's the use, it doesn't matter to even try, doesn't matter in the end, etc. This leaves a lot of time to be preoccupied with a deteriorating mind, running in circles with the same unworthy thoughts. It made it harder to progress in life."
depression,feht4w0,t3_cml6ni,1579123351.0,"The only way I am socializing with people is through selling my stuff in person and sometimes interacting with them if the opportunity arises. Maybe I talk about, for whom the item is for, my experience with the item, was traffic a problem, etc, just to fill in the random awkward silence where I just look at them inspecting the item or walking with them to a store for them to get some change. Anyway, Just selling my stuff in my room, so I can easily move out anywhere without much problem like a nomad or homeless. It takes effort to sell stuff, but I want to empty up my room and get back my money in the same time. So I try to do it anyway. I guess the good thing in selling in person makes me experience different scenarios even though it sucks sometimes. 

For example, one time(lesson learned) I waited almost two hours in public(I got nothing else going on in my life anyway) where the buyer insists that he is coming every time I text back for a situation. He finally came, and I ask the reason for this situation, he told me he lives far away, ok, I'll try to let this one slide. But he didn't have cash but suggest paying through Interact( like PayPal but safer). So I do it because fk it at this point. He sends me the money but was 5$ short, so I'm like wtf in my head, the item is already discounted. I ask the reason, he then shows me his bank account is close to zero. So I'm thinking wtf again, why do this to me. So I'm pissed for not getting the asking price and waited for so long, so I ask anything of little value, he shows me euros equal to a dollar, so I took that also. And we went along our way. He did say he moved in the country not too long ago, so I'll kinda let this slide, maybe not.

I learned to wait only a max of 15 or 20mins then I'm out of the meeting zone. I only got 1 no show with no response, the no show is worst for me, because I'm getting nothing. But, thanks to my lesson learned, I waited only 20minutes. For big items, I meet at my place. Sometimes I get desperate and just deliver the small item to their area."
Life,feg0xkj,t3_eotyiw,1579072229.0,"The point is many things. It could be pointless if your mind goes that way. For others, it's for their families, friends, people they care about, pets. It could be for showing kindness. Or some people live to be a troll. Or it could be for knowledge. Or drugs. It could be for risk-taking activities. The list can go on and on. Me, I don't know but I want to think its because I'll experience a better future, and to chill with good friends or people. I have zero friends...for now(staying positive). I guess, you just need to stay alive and live until you find that something/anything worth living for."
depression,fec7dex,t3_cml6ni,1578967921.0,"I thought collecting figurines was my new hobby in life, but now I regret starting it because I don't need them anymore and I lost a lot of money. Now I wish that money were in my pocket. I want to sell them and get back my money with some profit. But the total is not worth much. I feel like having a minimalist room where I have no attachment to, and so that I can finally have no place to call home. Maybe like being in a cage while daydreaming in empty space while forgetting reality. I don't know, maybe self-destruction is all I know."
SuicideWatch,fdm8nia,t3_em3ahe,1578542537.0,"Instilling/ brainwashing my mind with the thoughts that it would be a waste to not at least try to find a way to experience a good life of satisfaction and happiness, disregarding the thoughts of if it's possible or impossible. I can't do it for my parents/siblings/relatives since I don't feel nothing for them. Anyway, we only have one chance on this earth so I should at least find a way. Even though with this positive outlook, I still get moments of instability. And every day is a feeling of emptiness. Almost like walking in an endless desert with nothing but myself."
depression,fdlalnf,t3_cml6ni,1578519954.0,"Lately, I don't really watch youtube, anime and playing video games. I only mostly read manga and listen to music. But letting go of things that seem normal and ok to have makes me feel like I'm losing a part of myself. I'll continue with stopping these time-wasting, entertainment habits and replace it with things that will upgrade me, and feel more like ""a grown up"". Now it's with quitting manga. We'll see how it will turn out. It seems I don't know what I want. I feel like a lost cause for a long time, so it doesn't feel foreign to me to give up a part of myself."
depression,fdec0sb,t1_fddyspi,1578335724.0,"I think it's cool you took the time to write something. In the same time, I feel anti-social. So, I don't know what to say sometimes. But I guess if I don't know, I fill it with this randomness."
depression,fddscg6,t3_cml6ni,1578322720.0,"This is a nice place to just write stuff. But I'm already getting tired of being here. Like I don't belong here and there's no purpose. So I feel alone and empty. I feel tempted on smoking instead of sighing all the damn time. Or drink just to feel a short joy of self-destruction. But, I'll keep it clean for now..."
depression,fd5km45,t1_fd5d6un,1578178558.0,I don't know if I should throw some stuff or sell some stuff... I'll think about it after this meal break because I haven't eaten anything substantial throughout the day...

I just want to shut down. Like I don't want to think anymore and do things... I don't feel like venting or reading the rants or success anymore, but I'm still here lurking. Maybe hoping something will bring a change... I guess not..."

socialskills,fclyiv4,t3_ehsyhg,1577759604.0,"I don't really socialize so I forget, but it depends on the situation. If you and that stranger is partaking the same thing, like a classroom, a workplace, a video game club. It can usually go like this.

You: ""Hi, what's your name?""

Him: ""I'm Soul, and you?""

You: ""I'm Away""

You & Him: ""Nice to meet you.""

One of the random questions you can ask is about what he thinks about the place that he and you are right now (classroom, workplace, video game club).

Ex.:

You: ""How do you find it, this class/ the work we do/ the video games we play?""

Him: ""I think it's boring.""

You can share your detailed opinion on it and ending it with a question to see if he agrees with what you describe

You: ""I think it's fun because we get to spend time with other people, don't you like spending time with other people?""

If he disagrees you can ask a question to understand his perspective.

Him: ""I don't care too much about others.""

You: ""Did something happen?""

Him: ""It's a long story""

If you feel things aren't going well with a subject, ask about a different subject that's more light. Like his or your hobbies.  And the cycle continues of understanding each other as human beings. It can feel weird at first like we are role-playing, so doing it many times will make you forget that it is how it is. You might become silly if you get comfortable with a person, if you aren't already silly(bubbly person) from the start. And not everyone will be your friend.

The end."
funny,fc632vs,t3_egcfbz,1577471164.0,"That is what I call a, true loyal friend."
BPD,fc626yd,t3_eg9bt0,1577470593.0,"Yeah, I deleted facebook permanently after not receiving and communicating with supposedly friends for a long time. I don't think it was a good move from me because I think if I was willing to reach out to hang out, it could have happened. But I guess our friendship was not that strong that I would rather disappear from their life."
socialskills,fc60gma,t1_fc5lt08,1577469550.0,"Yeah. Also only saying hi for a long time to realize after, those people are having a good conversation with others while I'm here feeling alone by myself."
socialskills,fbvvjrw,t3_eekb2k,1577136690.0,"I don't know how that works without instruction. Should I then go outside walk on a sidewalk, see a pretty lady stranger in a distance walking towards me, make eye contact, maybe trying holding it for 5 seconds? Then if they're close to talking distance, should I like then say ""Hi, nice to meet you"", then after that sentence, I say ""Ok cool, Bye now"". After that little social situation, I walk along my way to nowhere just to be back in my room?"
