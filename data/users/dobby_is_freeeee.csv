Depersonalization,febdcmc,t1_feb3u5f,1578957646.0,"It’s possible  , I’m not a doctor just a kid that does their research and has a good few years of experience under their belt . But yeah it’s definitely possible , weed isn’t something that should be taken lightly , nor smoked heavily if you get my jist . Especially on people under the 18-20 years mark since it isn’t until that age that a Brain is fully developed, the brain not being fully developed means the chances of an excessive or more dangerous reaction are much higher ,  so short version , yes it’s definitely possible especially if you’ve had quite a lot of weed or / and are quite young . There’s a reason why your not meant to smoke weed , which is also why it was illegal but does anyone listen ? Of course not . 

DPDR isn’t just caused by weed though , for me personally it was caused by quite a traumatic childhood that happened due to a very rough divorce and mental health issues in my family . Basically anything that your brain finds too much or that it can’t deal with could trigger DPDR , even if it seems small to other people . If the brain can’t deal with it head on , why not take a few steps back ? 

I completely understand and agree that DPDR sucks , but you can see why I get frustrated hearing people say about how weed caused it , because I know that that means it was completely preventable and unnecessary for that person to have to go through it . But what I would say is to avoid thinking about it and just carry on as normal and hopefully it’ll subside , if you keep panicking about it and focusing on it your brain will keep hold of it as it knows it’s a good escape for stressful situations. Also , do NOT smoke weed again , it will almost definitely cause it to come back , become permanent or get worse ."

Break off the friendship , shes a total bitch . Also that was your Xmas present, and she just completely ruined it by being ungrateful and rude ."
