guns,ffdtjgf,t1_ffdt1ut,1579828564.0,"He had mentioned that if he was audited it could be a hassle. But for long guns purchased in NY no license or permit is required and you have to be at least 18 years old. CCW in NY is a whole different animal, to which I would understand if he was worried about me buying a handgun."
guns,ffds8l1,t1_ffds02p,1579827636.0,"Yeah he even mentioned that “I’m sure it’s legal in NY to purchase this gun as it’s a long gun” (which it is), but he was just bent out of shape over the fact that I have two addresses. Don’t a fair amount of people have two addresses?"
IAmA,ffdqc1y,t1_ffd6bq9,1579826401.0,My dealer isn’t a Sprinter Metris Dealer so I’ve never sold them before. Typically there is a separate sales staff for sprinter verses Mercedes cars.

IAmA,ff6ak06,t1_ff69izi,1579622959.0,What do you mean by intercepting? You found a vehicle on another dealers lot? Or is it coming into port and they are switching from there?
IAmA,ff69gyk,t1_ff68561,1579622256.0,"I think it is in mapped out areas. There are a lot of big dealer groups like Sonic and Penske, but theres a very good chance one of them has influence across your state. It's hard to make money at those dealers because they literally whore out every car for volume. We as a private dealer, still sell more than the nationally owned one in our state, and can make money doing it. It's all about the experience we offer to people.

And typically you will find at least from Mercedes-Benz standpoint, that working at a private one is a much more quality work life than a Nationally owned one.

EDIT: Clarity in my train of thought."
