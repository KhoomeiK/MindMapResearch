RATS,ffbcaio,t3_esovn6,1579759390.0,"Rats have something called porphyrin, which is basically a red discharge from the eyes and nose that typically happens when they’re stressed. A tiny bit is not much to worry about, especially if they’ve just gone through a stressful event - the vet, a bath, something scary happened. If it continues or it becomes a lot, get a vet to check it out, because it can be a sign of sickness. But if it goes away fairly quickly and doesn’t happen often, nothing to worry about. I had a rat who would get it every time I vacuumed!"
