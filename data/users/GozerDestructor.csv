I don't think that ""Forks Over Knives"", the documentary that I watched the day I became vegan, uses the word ""vegan"" even once - it's all ""Whole Foods Plant Based"".

WFPB eaters won't touch things like an Impossible Burger, or the various commercial vegan cheeses and meat substitutes, or refined sugar or oil or white flour, instead eating whole grains and vegetables only. Someone who is vegan for reasons of activism, or who isn't actively trying to lose weight, might have those things all the time.

I'm in between those extremes - I'll only occasionally have things like Daiya mac-and-cheese (alfredo style), and when I do I'll split it into 2 or 3 portions across separate days. I've had an impossible burger once, when traveling, mainly out of curiosity. I'm definitely not WFPB but - while on a weight loss program - try to eat like that most of the time."

It's inoffensive and low-effort. I don't want to cook immediately after getting out of bed, so I chose something that can be mixed in a shaker bottle in about 30 seconds, while I read reddit and continue my lengthly morning boot process.

One advantage is that Soylent, because it was designed to be a sole nutrition source, contains a complete protein - all 26 amino acids required for life, including the ones that can't be manufactured by the body from other aminos. Hemp seed, too, is a complete protein, so I've been adding that. As a vegan I want to be sure I consume complete protein every day. Grain and beans is the traditional combination for doing that, and I have plenty of grain and bean bowls (though not every day).

That's an answer that lots of people don't like to hear - the V-word generally garners a few downvotes - but it's a solution.  By making most of the calorie-dense food that I used to binge on (meat, cheese, ice cream) completely off-limits, completely absent from my house, there's nothing to be tempted by.

Most of what I eat now has lots of fiber in it, and fiber is satiating (makes you feel full).  Instead of my old habit of snacking on ice cream in the mid-afternoon, I'll have a fruit smoothie, which is going to be 200 calories or less and very filling.

Unless I'm gobbling huge handfuls of those few plant foods that are very dense in calories, like nuts and olives and french fries, I can eat as much as I want of anything I want without gaining weight. I also count calories with an app, and staying under my target of 1600 a day is generally effortless - and as that's 1000cal under my maintenance level of 2600, it has led to a steady weight loss of 2 pounds a week for over four months now.

It's also meant to be a permanent change. I have absolutely no desire to eat meat or milk because I'm part of a subculture that considers those things disgusting (in the same way that most people would consider eating roadkill disgusting). And, as it's an entire subculture, there are lots of subreddits to join and recipes to explore - I'm enjoying cooking again, for the first time in years."

Yet somehow I always found excuses to take the elevator.  ""I'm just tired!""

I resolved to lose weight last year, mainly by eating right but by sprinkling in a bit of exercise after I've lost enough flab that the slightest movement wouldn't wear me out. A few weeks into it, I bought a Fitbit, and it prompts me every hour to get 250 steps. Which means I've walked all the corridors of my building, and all the stairways. I've continued to lose weight (down 42lb now!) and get this moderate exercise every day - and now I can climb 7 flights with only a slight increase in breathing and heart rate at the top.

In August I saw Weird Al Yankovic do a show in Seattle. He was 59 years old but looked 40 - and delivered an amazingly energetic performance. Sure, he sat on a stool for one or two songs, but most of the time he was running around on stage, even into the audience at one point (climbing into seats, hugging people, perching on their armrests as a camera followed him around). He was inspirational - and a lot more fit than 46-year-old me with my BMI 35.

Weird Al is also vegan, and has been for many years. I'd been thinking about going vegan for my health (I'd developed a sensitivity to cheese, which gave me roaring headaches), and had purchased Penn Jillette's book about weight loss through plant-based diet (""Presto! How I made over 100 pounds disappear"") but not yet read it.

That was over four months ago, and I haven't had meat, cheese, egg or milk since. I've lost 41 pounds and am no longer obese.

The National Weight Control Registry, which the article you linked is about, says that they track 10K+ persons who have kept the weight off. That's a tiny number, though, when compared to the US population (it's a US-based study).

Is there something we can quote saying, for example,""40% of those who intentionally try to lose weight are slimmer five years later"" - something that evaluates the percent chance of success? Because to effectively counter something like ""95%"" you have to use similar units."
