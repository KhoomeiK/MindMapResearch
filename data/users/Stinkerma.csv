Baked chicken makes a few meals, add rice and veggies for a meal then next meal make a casserole... save bones and make soup stock, using leftover meat in the soup. 

Ground beef, a handful of pearl barley, a bag of frozen mixed veggies, some beef stock, and tomato paste makes enough soup to freeze.

Squash, gourds, pumpkins are all quick and easy sides. Bake with butter. Blend into chicken soup stock for easy soup. Have some instant mashed potatoes on hand to thicken the soup 

Broccoli, chicken soup stock and instant mashed potato flakes make a quick cream of broccoli soup. Add milk or cream to thin it out a bit if you like. Same goes for cauliflower, carrot.

If you have time and patience, sourdough bread is fairly straightforward to make. If you’re not a baker, drop biscuits are even easier."
funny,fekolaw,t1_feklhzp,1579204377.0,"Hard to sugarcoat where food comes from.  No industry is perfect but maligning one industry to make another seem better is not helpful. I haven’t seen one part of the food industry that is perfect. From growing vegetables to growing meat, there is not one part that is perfect. Fruit and vegetable farms exploit labourers at the cost of their health. Meat and poultry industries are in the midst of being updated to be more humane to animals.  Industrial kitchens are no better, treatment of people working in the food industry is horrendous. I think it’s safe to say that people need to be smarter about food, and looking at places that are far away from the food on their plate isn’t helping.  Heaping changes on farmers then expecting food to stay the same prices, means those farmers will be forced out of their livelihood.  Not sure factory farms are better, seeing as they tend to have worse welfare for animals and humans than smaller operations.  But yes, stealing food from a baby cow is a big concern. Especially since farmers want to keep those baby cows alive and healthy."
funny,fekl9sv,t1_fekjsjz,1579202398.0,"Dairy and veal are two separate industries. Please don’t confuse the two. Dairy cows are kept alive as long as possible, beef cattle are slaughtered before they turn three. Cows are kept a few years longer but slaughtered while they are still saleable. As to keeping them indoors, I think most cows would prefer to be inside than losing a teat or two to frostbite. As to keeping their calves longer, this is true. I’m pretty sure they don’t like having their back legs lifted off the ground when their calf butts their udder! And yes, dairy cows tend to have more mastitis.  Treatment for mastitis is a round of antibiotics injected into the nipple, with the milk dumped for a number of days. I forget the timeframe. That usually clears it up.  Farmers prefer to keep cows alive and healthy to getting rid of the animals. They get expensive."
funny,fekh7r2,t1_fekg6qg,1579199981.0,You need water to make milk. No water for cows carries a risk of pneumonia which is far worse than reduced milking. By all accounts the guy wasn’t all that interested in farming.

funny,fekgv45,t1_fekf7z9,1579199776.0,"Dairy is impregnating cows via artificial insemination to reduce the risk of inbreeding and feeding the calves a healthy portion of the milk their mothers produce and then milking a cow for a longer time before impregnating them.  Unless you’re referring to veal, which is a disgusting practice that is not limited to calves from the dairy industry, bull calves do get sold into the beef industry.  As to the age of dairy cows, they tend to live longer lives than beef cattle. Also, bulls tend to try and impregnate cows on their first heat after calving. Yay for AI where the cows are most often checked by a vet before being bred."
funny,fekfksc,t1_fekerl7,1579199003.0,They’re not cheap! They don’t cheep? Hmm. Most dairy farmers keep all the heifers and raise them for themselves. Bull calves go to the beef industry. Artificial insemination kinda takes over their role.
funny,fekeiur,t1_fekdy5w,1579198380.0,"Dairy is all about keeping an animal healthy for a long time, beef is about fattening an animal up to sell it.  First calf heifers are selling for over $3000 in my area, I don’t know if many dairy farmers have that much money to treat cows badly. In smaller operations, the farmer knows each cow in his herd, down to personality and temperament and it’s not easy to see them sick or injured.  Dairy cows are leaner and lankier than beef cattle."
funny,fekdsbc,t1_fekc2by,1579197937.0,"Yes! A dairy farm in the area I live in was found to be treating his cows inhumanely by not providing a constant source of water. Lost his quota, lost his cows and is no longer able to grow animals. On top of that, was fined a considerable amount too."
