medicine,feomza8,t1_fenwtq9,1579302446.0,"I don't disagree with the differences in training being markedly different.  Our physician colleagues spend more time (orders of magnitude) in training.  But to state that RN training doesn't have some very serious amount of value (in hands on patient care/assessment) is not quite right either.  I work bedside in an ICU at a level 4 trauma/academic hospital.  I've seen plenty of interns (who by the OP graphs have received thousands of hours of training) who can't describe lung sounds, or perform a reasonably detailed cardiac exam.  Obviously this isn't always the norm - but hours of training doesn't always equal proficiency.

I liked the way a manager once put it to me - there are some people that have 20 years of experience, and some people that have one year of experience 20 times."
medicine,feolebz,t1_fenlzij,1579301799.0,"Not here for an argument, but the rest of that story (the article you linked) is that the increased imaging is on the order of 0.1-0.3% more imaging.  We aren't talking about a CT on every patient here: this is 1-3 more images *per thousand* patients seen.

""APCs were associated with more imaging than PCPs (odds ratio [OR], 1.34 [95% CI, 1.27-1.42]), ordering 0.3% more images per episode. Advanced practice clinicians were associated with increased radiography orders on both new (OR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.13-1.66]) and established (OR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.24-1.43]) patients, ordering 0.3% and 0.2% more images per episode of care, respectively. For advanced imaging, APCs were associated with increased imaging on established patients (OR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.14-1.44]), ordering 0.1% more images, but were not significantly different from PCPs ordering imaging on new patients."""

harmonica,fdioc0y,t1_fdhyiqw,1578447381.0,"Disagree with others - I find u blocking great for multiple reasons.  I thought it was easier to transition to tongue blocking after learning u blocking - I had no luck initially with tongue blocking.  You can certainly use all three - I find some songs are better for each method.  If you can get single notes with a u block, that is great and will give you immediate feedback on breath control, volume, etc. while you are picking up the other methods.

I will say that I find bending some notes harder with u blocking."
medicine,fcy6ekg,t1_fcxc58k,1578075431.0,"This is why I send my scan reports to the patient's PCP any time there is a question of whether a finding is important or not in the long run.  Things that may not mean anything to me in the hospital, may answer a boatload of questions for the PCP who has been following the patient for several years.

If it is something absolutely vital for long term f/u, I also make a point to call the PCP and let them know to be on the lookout for the report. 

I agree with you that there are often studies that you are not privvy to, but one would assume you aren't liable for things you have not been informed of."
YouShouldKnow,fc3u5nq,t1_fc1w81v,1577398705.0,"The original post implied that >65=already have money.  A followup comment also noted that ""many old people got"" direct pensions that are equal to their retiring salary.  

Both of these statements are less than valid."
AskReddit,fc3tvbn,t1_fc2u751,1577398497.0,"As told to me buy a general surgeon this year, the trick, if one wants to know, is as follows:

1. Buy hemorrhoid pads - tucks, etc. Also buy a bottle of witch hazel.
2. Dump out the liquid in the pads - it is low % WH, replace with the good stuff you just bought.
3. As the name suggests, *tuck* a pad up on the affected anus and let it sit for as long as you are willing.  Do this multiple times daily.

This can make a huge difference to the duration of the hemorrhoid problem.  This is the best advice I ever received on the subject."
AskReddit,fc1p7hs,t1_fc1lmox,1577325352.0,Skip that and go straight to the witch hazel.

I have a fixture that won't support a CFL (none fit!) and even the brightest LED bulb they have at my local store pales in comparison to the old incandescents.  It isn't a fixture I use all the time, just when I'm reading.  I would be more than happy to pay the extra energy cost to be able to read more easily."
