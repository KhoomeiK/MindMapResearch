aww,ff9hldy,t1_ff8z1ox,1579713183.0,"Cat tongues don’t have a passive function like ours do. We use our tongue to hold our mouths closed by creating suction with the roof of our mouths (sorry to make you conscious of that at this moment). 

Feline tongues are made up of what’s called impulsive muscles - the cat consciously keeps its tongue still until he needs it. Imagine if your arm automatically waved around unless you focused on having it not wave - that’s how feline tongues work. It keeps kitty aware of his tongue so he doesn’t bite it with his sharp teeth which could do real damage to his ability to bathe, drink, and eat.

A sedated cat doesn’t focus on keeping his tongue still, and at this point the impulse muscles take over which is what’s happening here. The movements are relatively similar for every cat and if you put a piece of glass in front of him to lick and you follow along with a marker from the other side, it’ll become apparent that the cats tongue is spelling out a manifesto in perfect Latin outlining their plans for world domination."

They’re called Phoenix trees and typically they don’t grow very large before giving way to more hardy foliage. Their main purpose is to eliminate the high carbon content in the soil, which rebalances it for the native plants to sprout. 

Anyone who dumps their wood fireplace ash in their back yard during a January thaw will probably see one of these sprout eventually. They usually look very similar to the local foliage in the area except for the brighter tips.

They get their name because they rise from the ashes with those golden tips as a sign of impending regrowth. As the tree matures it’ll eventually burst into a cloud of carbon that’ll take the shape of a Phoenix who will ignite into a softly glowing flame and fly off into the night - leaving the soil primed and ready for a new green growth. The Phoenix will likely never be seen again, but they’re out there."
aww,ff4qb41,t1_ff4crju,1579569874.0,"This behavior is called “active guarding” and it’s exhibited by dogs (almost always towards other dogs) when they’re willing to protect one another. By covering the throat with his head, he’s saying that he’ll stop a dangerous attacker from getting to the vulnerable spots of his friend.

Directing this act to a human is actually extremely rare and - while it’s not a cause for concern - I do wonder if there’s something else going on in this video.

To be blunt, exhibiting this behavior towards a human is just unheard of - no matter how loyal the dog might be. This video is almost concrete proof that the lady is a werewolf or some sort of shape shifting pup and her pup knows it and this is him trying to tell the world."
mildlyinteresting,ff0f0d3,t1_fezzekd,1579468257.0,"When electricity first came to homes it was considered bad luck to have a lighting fixture that cast any shadows. People thought the artificial shadows were vessels for evil spirits to enter their homes. The bulbs were left bare and exposed in order to bathe home home in as much clean light as possible.

Bulbs were also arranged throughout the home to cover all of the area, leaving no corner or crevice darkened. Older houses often still have traces of the knob and tube wiring that ran these setups locked away in their walls.

For a long time tales of haunted houses all but ceased and the superstitions increased around well lit homes. Once the ghosts and demons got bored of waiting around for bulbs to blow though they just started haunting well lit houses again. It was less effective for them, but they were able to still scare occupants with their pranks and spooky noises on any given well-lit evening if they just put in some extra effort. After that, artsy lighting fixtures became super popular and everyone felt really dumb."
aww,fenwql0,t1_fenloo7,1579292026.0,"The whole movement is called “indenting” and it’s leftover behavior from cats having to live in the wild. They’d plop down into plants or brush to hide themselves, to keep warm, and for comfort. 

The behavior can be mistaken as affection when done to humans but it’s still a survival instinct through and through. It’s not really an act of dominance or aggression, but a cat will do it to mostly anyone for his own comfort and well-being.

If kitty is precise enough, he’ll hit the same spot each time and the human will eventually flatten and find himself with a permanent cat-dent in his body. The cat eventually won’t even have to get up if the human goes to the fridge, he’ll be wedged into his dent comfortably, just riding around. If he indented over any part of the central nervous system, he can also pilot the human using electrical signals from his whiskers."
gifs,felxlzs,t1_felr9dh,1579233509.0,"You have to release just as the water closes back in on top of you as you sink into it. The technique is known officially as “displacement propulsion” and it happens as the liquid tries to return it it’s undisturbed state, causing it to forcefully push the spherical object away from all sides. 

The ball is against the divers body, so it can’t go downwards. The water pushes in from all sides with the weight of an entire lake, so up is the only way to go. By displacement propulsion standards, this is a pretty weak launch.

The larger the body of water, the more force you’ll get. If this man were to use this technique off of a boat in the middle of an ocean, that ball would reach earth escape velocity. It’s actually illegal to use displacement propulsion in international waters for this reason, unless you’re permitted by NASA to launch interstellar vehicles in advance. It’s how humans first got into space, but big rocket corporations lobbied for that to not be in history books because teenagers kept doing it to graffiti the moon with obscene stuff."
interestingasfuck,fdgsp6a,t1_fdgif12,1578407332.0,"I never believed that old story about Solagrius and the colossus until now. These are horrifying!

Edit: for those who don’t know the story  -

Solagrius was an Athenian general fighting against the Persians sometime before the whole Leonidas and his 300 Spartans thing happened.

Solagrius was posted at the top edge of a large canyon planning an ambush as the Persian army passed below him by dropping a pile of boulders on them. However, the afternoon that the Persians passed through was especially sunny, and the pile of stones cast its shadow onto the far canyon wall in the form of a hundreds foot high colossus.

The Persians stopped dead in their tracks, stunned by the existence of some huge monster who might cast that shadow. Xerxes himself proclaimed the Greeks to be sorcerers and the army turned and left the canyon. Solagrius had no idea what happened, but he was relieved to not have to fight that day.

Xerxes was furious and vowed to defeat the colossus and its creators. He went back to camp and got out his chemistry set and mixed together every compound he could find before feeding it to whatever animal he could find. Back then, the ingredients were really nuts and they’d do some super cool stuff. Mixing them all together was like pushing the nuclear launch button. The animals who drank the stuff would twist and mutate and become horrible monsters under his command. He went back to Greece and faced the colossus once and for all. Except when he finally found it, he realized that it was just a small rock pile.

Xerxes was embarrassed and his monsters were super upset not to be able to fight something so they turned their sights on Sparta because Athens was having a BBQ that day and by Greek war laws you never interrupt a man’s BBQ. TMZ caught wind of the drama and sent cameras and that’s how the movie 300 was shot."
pics,fdeoj3n,t1_fdecpmc,1578343345.0,"If this is the wrong place to share this just let me know: Cats do actually display different traits and behaviors in other cultures! Whether it’s the slightly modified inflection of the “meow” in Mexican born cats, or it’s the abnormally strong affinity for seafood as though it were a delicacy in cats who live in desert countries like Egypt - geography changes feline behavior.

The most interesting cases occur if cats are introduced to and raised in environments where they’re not natively present like ships that are largely at sea, or Antarctic science outposts where the researchers bring them to be pets.

In these cases, no matter where the cat is originally from - and maybe because of the technology that’s usually required to have a cat in such remote places - The cat becomes attracted to electronics and radio signals. There are actual recorded instances of cats piecing together working aircraft and attempting to escape the environment. Due to their amateur pilot status, the cats get quickly distracted by getting into dogfights with birds and running out of fuel. They return home with bruised pride on most occasions, their owners never knowing about their adventures, and unable to figure out why their kitty is so annoyed on that particular morning."
interestingasfuck,fcr1jqa,t1_fcqo4pk,1577895418.0,"Drone shows are still prohibitively expensive for most companies to put on.

Everyone assumes that the initial cost of purchasing the drone and any computer flight modeling is the total expense of the show, but you also have to consider transporting dozens if not hundreds of drones and their individual pilots who will work in conjunction with the computer models.

The pilots are where the huge cost really stems from. They’re much more highly trained than you might think, and finding kittens small enough to fit in a drone and strong enough to man the controls isn’t easy. After weeks of flight school when they’re finally ready for the big show their career expectancy is usually only months long before they’re too big to fly. From there they join the actual cat air force or they become flight instructors themselves."
mildlyinteresting,fcgetd0,t1_fcg8is4,1577639265.0,"Possibly but probably not. It's likely these plates were manufactured in, or based off of a template for design created in the 1960s by an American ceramics company. In those years, most companies were seeking a license called ""ST-Use"", which stipulated (among many things) that if a piece breaks, it must only break into easily traceable pieces of equal size.

""ST-Use"" actually stood for ""Space Travel Use"" and was part of the space travel craze that enveloped the nation in those years. NASA said that if and when a moon-base was completed, that any piece of furnishing brought must meet their exacting standards. Plates, couches, ovens, and even pets of wealthy owners who were willing to pay for it all could get ""ST-Use"" licensing.

It was most interesting for pets - dogs had to be taught to exist safely around basic machinery, and cats had to be vetted to ensure that they wouldn't do ""cat stuff"" and intentionally destroy the moon-base to eliminate all humans. What's not widely known is that NASA did begin construction on the moon-base, but the cats betrayed their agreement and threatened to poke holes in the thin lining separating the people from the vacuum of space. The cats made all of the humans go home and overtook the moon base, where they live now. The reason we haven't ever gone back is that NASA is pretty sure they've created weaponized laser beams from the laser pointer toys that were left there. The US. has explored a ""Space Force"" with the intention of retaking the moon, but Elon Musk has wisely set his sights on Mars instead, claiming that we need a larger space presence if we're going to challenge the moon cats in any real capacity."
aww,fc9dti3,t1_fc8zaqo,1577551128.0,"Same! Dogs tend to fare very well with prosthetic limbs - this fact is becoming especially apparent as the practice of fitting them is becoming more and more scientifically sound... not to mention that studies around the subject actually have some funding these days.

Side effects are usually minimal There’s actually some proof that dogs with mechanical or prosthetic legs tend to be drawn to one another for support and empowerment. They might sneak off at night to secret meetings where they research things like web guns and strength augmentation before venturing out to fight crime and thwart feline super villains. 

It’s possible, and even likely that the entire reason that your neighborhood isn’t being harassed by a Mischievous Maine Coon is because the 3 legged lab down the street is a secret super hero. Science hasn’t been able to prove that this isn’t the case yet, so take that for what it’s worth."
mildlyinteresting,fc3cora,t1_fc33g56,1577386877.0,"Current generation $50 bills are the only bill that you can reliably fold into the more complex origami shapes because they're printed with paper infused with silver metal flakes. I wonder if this is how OP knew it was $100 total. Either way, go ahead and try it with a $1 or a $100, it won't work as well as a $50 does due to the properties of the paper and its ability to hold shape.

The $100 is printed with a similar method, but using gold (making them too heavy to hold shapes), and smaller denominations are just printed on paper. The idea obviously is that the bill should carry some physical value and not just the idea of value by being backed by precious metals. It also makes counterfeit bills easier to pick out.

The next generation of bills won't contain any metals, as this was quickly determined to be a failed method of adding value to bills. The issue is that so many people are folding $50s into shapes that they're hard to come by in the stores. If you pay with a $100 you'll probably get your change in $20s, not $50s. In fact, the US Gov't has an entire team of folks employed to track down and unfold money origami to return it to circulation. They're known as the ""Silver Foxes"" and they consist of retired special forces units and origami-expert grandmothers who can reliably unfold bills. They will raid suspected homes late at night based on pinterest account activity and replace all of the $50 origami with a pile of 2x $20s, a $10, and a stern note scolding the resident for his actions and asking that he be more responsible with his origami habits in the future."
interestingasfuck,fbkqwjr,t1_fbk4fs9,1576954331.0,"This isn’t a super new image. It’s been one of the most studied over the past years and almost every astrophysics expert agrees that it’s one of the best indicators that there was at one point flourishing life on mars.

The main point of interest is that huge channel dead center of the image. To the right it appears to flow into an ocean and to the left it breaks up into smaller deltas. Water was absolutely present here once.

The point that most scientists raise is that there are no existing conditions on the planet that would cause that much water to be gone. Scientists are quite sure that martians drank all of the water and then left for the next most obvious destination: Neptune. Humans saw the Martian water crisis coming for decades so they named Neptune after the ocean god so the Martians would go there instead of coming to earth and drinking all of our water. They’re probably mad at us but they’re far enough away where it’s just funny now."
