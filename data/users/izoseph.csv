AskReddit,ffp3cdb,t3_eu6sfl,1580085455.0,"Tobacco companies are paying big money to have people that vape look bad and say that it’s targeting kids with the flavors. I’ve been vaping for 6 years and not once have I ever seen anyone under 17-18 use the products and even then they had the juices that didn’t have nicotine in them. If it’s so bad why aren’t tobacco companies being banned for causing cancer?

She’s called me every name in the book for”abandoning” her, but really she failed me as a parent and let her parents raise me. I’m better off for it, I would’ve been a disaster had she raised me and I know that now, but 10 year old me didn’t know that. 10 year old me didn’t understand why her best chance at life had to be without me in it. I love my parents that adopted me because they were there for everything until I was out of high school :) that’s all I remembered as a kid, and all my mom was good for was money and objects because I had no attachment to her, I still don’t and at this point I never will"

NTA at all, if they can’t afford to give you a little extra to even scrape minimum wage or give you a nice “bonus” since you’ve been doing them a favor. I know this is easy to say because I don’t have it like that but you would be the first person I thought of since you’re doing me a favor and that’s the kind of person I am :/"

She kept in contact a lot at first, then it turned into not very much, eventually dwindled down to “happy birthday” and that’s the only contact I have with her. I don’t even consider her a mom or even a friend for that matter. If you’re going to put yourself first, be prepared for children that put themselves first and tell you to fuck off. YTA."
