I personality think you should reconsider flat fees, because royalties are obnoxious to deal with, especially without auditing. Flat fees are simple, and they give a producer actual value vs theoretical value. They give them something to build towards vs just hoping you blow up. And that built up worth translates well to royalties down the road."

Consider there might be a reason for some of these things. Nat 20's aren't guaranteed to work based on the situation. He might let you roll, but he might have features or active spells on his character that protects them from things like deception. It's common to let players try impossible things. But it's also totally possible he just wanted a fight. 

I'm also a little confused at what you meant by he didn't have your sheet during the trip attack. Why would he need to look at your sheet to see the saving throw? I have no idea what the D4's were for, but it may fall into the category of some esoteric feature the enemy has. 

Changing rules on the fly is a big no no. Had you been playing with finesse up to that point? And he just changed it? Anyone that acts like they are final say on the rules while also changing them as needed is not fun to play with. There are times where maybe they're like ""you can't knock someone out with a chainsaw, even though we've been knocking people out with bladed weapons"" Sure. But I ask you all these questions because, in isolation, these things don't sound bad. But together it sounds like a boring, railroady experience. 

But I can still see it from the DM's perspective. And I'd like to think there's a reason for all of it. But the phrase ""I am God"" strikes me as a person that doesn't see this as cooperative. 

And I've seen a few people accuse you of being competitive as well as him, and that's bullshit. You're supposed to advocate, desperately, for your character's life and story. He's supposed to make that hard for you, so when you achieve something it's worthwhile. He's not supposed to make it impossible and take the power out of your hands. Both are extremes, and both take meaning out of the game. 

 You've been playing by the rules, and the goalposts get moved. There's nothing more frustrating than making a character and then finding out certain house rules are going to totally fuck with your vision of the session/campaign, and your ability to affect the story."

FL_Studio,fdeot8l,t3_ekvx3z,1578343507.0,"I hate to say it but a lot of people in here are greatly overestimating it's importance. Mastering is not a make or break thing, and will not fix any real problems in your song, but a good engineer with a good setup can make your song a bit more consistent in different locations. 

It's also not something you just ""learn on the side,"" as a lot of people in this thread seem to be implying. It's a completely different skill unrelated to mixing and requires a very good, neutral setup that little to no people have. 

But it's hard to suss this stuff out, cause the definition is changing. To a lot of people, mastering means making things loud and making them smack with things like Ozone. And that may be what a lot of beatmakers do, but eventually these big rappers send their stuff off to a well known engineer. 

I would focus on arrangement and general mixing, and not worry too much about ""diving into"" mastering. But I recognize it is a big part of beatmaking nowadays. You can always mix into mastering plugins if that's the case"
