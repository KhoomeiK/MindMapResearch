changemyview,fdogxbj,t1_fdo9h0h,1578604918.0,"I don't think a study really has the last word anyway. But just through observation we can see that people who live in very urban areas tend to have worst outcomes in all sorts of ways vs people who live in more natural environments. You can't attribute it all to environment, but I think we can agree that high levels of noise, artificial distraction, traffic, threats from strangers, etc., tends to have a negative impact on us. Stress levels tend to be higher in the city, and we know that chronic stress is associated with negative health outcomes.

All things being equal, including income, people who grow up in nature are going to have an advantage over people who in urban areas. This is true of animals too, and it's why zoos are full of neurotic animals. I heard a good interview with a brain development expert talking about how the human brain needs a certain amount of exposure to nature if it's going to thrive. The city is more chaotic, and we see this especially in the inner city. It doesn't matter how much wealth you have, if you're growing up in the inner city of Chicago, it's not ideal."

changemyview,fdo8vcw,t1_fdo0gds,1578600901.0,"I don't agree with your logic here. Studies show that frequent exposure to nature - not just doing a few trips a year - is good for mental health and even extends life expectancy. Though I do think you can live in the city or with easy access to the city and have many of the same benefits, dependong on the place."

AmItheAsshole,fdk1cp2,t1_fdi7kdr,1578493619.0,">I was once asked if I was going to bring homemade baked goods for a team member who had gotten a promotion

That's different than participating in a potluck and bringing pre-packaged, highly processed junk food though, right? OP would have been better off just saying she has no time to participate than in bringing in super cheap stuff from Aldi. Generally, you don't go to a potluck with stuff like that.

They shouldn't have said anything, but OP would be better off not bringing in anything than to expect people to enjoy that at a potluck."
AmItheAsshole,fdk10g1,t1_fdixuz3,1578493373.0,"Well, potlucks usually mean bringing something homemade. You don't go to a potluck dinner and bring highly-processed junk food, right? OP would have been better off opting out of the potluck rather than bringing the cheapest cupcakes she could find. It's rude of her coworkers to say something, but she's not doing anyone any favors by bringing in Aldi cupcakes unless her coworkers have no consideration for what they put in their mouths."
AmItheAsshole,fdk0smz,t1_fdiw9pt,1578493213.0,"> Was most of the stuff at the potluck homemade?  

If we are having a potluck at my work, nobody is going to be excited about Aldi cupcakes - it's not really in the spirit of a potluck. Hope OP doesn't go to potluck dinners with packaged, highly-processed food."
AmItheAsshole,fdk0luo,t1_fdjgfxh,1578493076.0,"It's true that I would have zero interest in Aldi cupcakes. Lots of people don't want to eat the cheapest, most highly-processed food available."

AmItheAsshole,fdhosmt,t1_fdhn8dy,1578427159.0,"There is a big difference between a room with one set of lights on and the room in question, which is genuinely dark when there are no lights on. There is some illumination, but as I said, it's hard to even tell if there is another person in the room until you're in the room and your eyes have adjusted to the dark. Having lights on is a good thing in a room with steps and heavy equipment, right? 

Moreover, you don't even know if the person in there is the original person who wanted the lights off. Maybe the original person left."
AmItheAsshole,fdhkfj3,t1_fdhkahk,1578424530.0,"I guess the reason I hesitate is that, by not turning on the lights, someone has clearly declared that they prefer not to have the lights on. That's fine - sometimes I want it dim in my apartment. But hopefully they understand that the default should be that lights are on. I think there is a good chance that they'll think that their preference should be respected because they were there first."
AmItheAsshole,fdhk5qx,t1_fdhjzzc,1578424365.0,I suppose that's true. Maybe next time I see this I'll change into workout clothes and waltz in and turn on the lights to see what the response will be (I live on the same floor as the gym so I pass by it a lot).
AmItheAsshole,fdhk0bl,t1_fdhjnhk,1578424276.0,"Perhaps I'm overthinking, but I think there is a very good chance they're going to give a pissy look and/or say something, so I'm just wondering if such a response would be warranted. Obviously it'd be going against their preference."
vaxxhappened,fdcaa1j,t1_fdc27un,1578270216.0,">So nah, fuck them. 

I'm not an anti-vaxxer at all but I think people paint this as black-and-white when some people who are labeled ""anti-vax"" are just raising questions about vaccine schedules. Some are obviously nuts, but they all get painted with the same brush. 

When I went to the doctor somewhat recently here in the US, the doctor recommended I get a tetanus booster. I looked it up and both the WHO and the UK government no longer recommend tetanus boosters every 10 years, as research now says there [is very little data to back up that recommendation](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/62/9/1111/1745278). So I declined the booster even though it remains the CDC's recommendation. I don't think it makes me anti-vax to inquire about the vaccine schedule as it exists in the US at this moment."

loseit,f6lm5t3,t3_drvyh0,1572952578.0,"\> All restaurants here either have you go in and sit down or take it with you.

I don't understand what other options there are. Are you saying there are no places that are strictly take-out? So what is the problem with that? Not all restaurants offer seating, whether you're in the US, Japan, etc.

\> $5 quickly made pizzas are on every block.

Where do you live in the US? This is not the case anywhere where I have lived. Berlin is a major, cosmopolitan city, so you should be comparing it to our biggest, most cosmopolitan cities. It's not a fair comparison if you're comparing it to the burbs.

I live in Chicago and tons of restaurants don't have parking - that is life in the city. I have lived here for over 12 years and haven't had a car in that time - I walk and take public transit.

There are lots of ""ethnic"" grocery stores that are similar to the ones you describe - you don't have to go to the big supermarkets or Walmart if you don't want to (I have rarely ever been in a Walmart). A few miles away from me there is actually German grocery store, not to mention all sorts of Asian marts, Trader Joe's (which is awesome), Aldi (which is German), etc.

Yes, there are lots of unhealthy options, but you can be as healthy as you want to be.

Sounds like you're in the honeymoon period of living in a new city, and you're mistaking aspects of city life for German superiority."
