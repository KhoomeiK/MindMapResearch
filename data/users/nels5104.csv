We would also push people lightly from behind when they were pissing in a urinal. The slow teeter forward and eventual shouldering in the wall was hilarious. And again, harmless."

My coworker and I spent quite a bit of time (and a fair amount of money) eating sushi before heading to the airport."

“Nah, dude. Shit happens. Eat the $20 loss and get back in line for a shot at the table again later.”

That’s what pissed him off more than the money, he waited patiently to play some pool and didn’t even get to stroke his cue. If he hadn’t been such a dick about losing off the break, everyone would have gladly allowed the rematch immediately but his tantrum nixed that quickly."

Most of my friends were STEM majors so my perception is skewed to potheads being nerds (myself included). But I knew a lot of burnout (they were dumb to begin with) stoners too."

I don’t think you’ll find many people stating he will win anything based on the polls. But they do show his support growing, which is the point of the polls. So yes, they do serve a purpose.

But, what I thought would be impossible is actually somewhat reachable. I just don’t see it happening in that short of a time. He would need to play another 6-7 seasons (at least) to catch Gretzky. 

I read an article after Ovi won the Cup about how his fitness has declined a bit. So I can only imagine it’s going to go farther down as he approaches 40.

It’s well known that most QBs out of college should be allowed to develop before being thrown straight in to the game. It’s not a secret. The current climate of the NFL is win now with coaches being tossed aside after a year or two. They don’t want to let their new QB to develop, they want production so they can coach again next year. 

Patriots were in the midst of doing it with Jimmy G (2nd rounder) but who the hell knew that Tom
Brady would age so gracefully.
