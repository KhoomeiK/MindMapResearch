Yeah, this has been a long day.  The point that I was trying to make was that [the population of San Francisco plus the areas just outside the city limits proper, known as the Bay Area, has a population of about 7.75 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area).  [The population of Toronto plus the areas just outside it's city limits proper has a population of about 5.9 million.](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/as-sa/fogs-spg/Facts-cma-eng.cfm?LANG=Eng&GK=CMA&GC=535&TOPIC=1)

So San Francisco 'feels' more populated because there's a million more people around even though the [population of the City of San Francisco at 883k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco) is much smaller than [that of Toronto at 2.9 million.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Toronto#Population)

The [observations of emerging megaregions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalopolis#United_States) makes me even more wrong, since Toronto is counted as part of a mega region that stretches from Montreal some crazy how to Chicago and St. Louis and Minneapolis, for a current 59 million versus NorCal at 14 million.

Nothing you claimed is confirmed in SimpleTax's statement.  They made no mention of historical data going into a secondary system.  They made no mention of decrypting historical data so that your password is not required to access it.

We’re not going to set up some millionaire/low-billionaire as a jilted business partner who sought revenge on a former colleague and then killed himself out of remorse before he could be arrested and charged?  Or the ex-husband of a woman who had an affair with Epstein and killed him in revenge?  Or the father of a trafficked and raped child?

Using [WealthSimple's calculator](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/tool/retirement-calculator/), and the following values:

25 years old, income of 250k, $1M in an RRSP or TFSA now.

Targeted retirement at 40 years old (what I think is the standard for early retirement, anything younger is extreme early retirement, right?), life expectancy 95 years, spending $145k after tax.  OP would need to save $22,500 per month every month between 25 years old and 40 years old.  On top of paying off a $1-2M mortgage on a home in 15 years.  (That savings rate is higher than what a $250k income could support, and that's not factoring OP needing to pay any bills now.)

canada,fdlrpg4,t1_fdlqbcg,1578530903.0,"Due to the speeds that the engine components are spinning, if something breaks in the engine, the pieces have enormous centrifugal force.  They want to travel in a straight line perpendicular to the axis of rotation.  Some pieces will travel towards the aircraft.  Turbofan engines for passenger jets are therefore designed to 'contain' all pieces in the case of something breaking.

If the containment system fails for some reason, then it is termed an unconstrained engine failure and you have extremely hard, jagged metal pieces moving very quickly out of the engine.

In this case, part of the engine cowling is what smashed into the window, not one of the fan blades (no through and through or exit punctures were found in the casing).  There was enough damage done inside the engine to allow the cowling to come away from the engine and slap the fuselage and break the window.  

The pressure of the air in the cabin, plus the wind, pulled her through the window.  The partial ejection refers to the fact that while she was seated and buckled in, the top of her body was hanging out of the window.  She wasn't ripped in half or anything.  Part of her body was outside of the plane, part of her body was in.

Other passengers pulled her back in and performed CPR.  She died of her injuries, (next part is speculation) most likely crush injuries (lungs, spleen, liver, etc) from the huge pressures that were pushing her torso against the window frame, but I don't know."

It is very misleading to try to draw a trend and say that this is the third Boeing 737 crash in the last 18 months, because that implies that it's because of similar issues.  The factors of the two 737 MAX crashes are now well-understood and those factors were not present on the 737-800."

The plane in this incident, the 737-800 model is a member of the 737 Next Generation family, which was launched over 20 years ago.  All of the fatal crashes in the NG family within the last four years are:

* a flight that crashed due to severe weather coupled with pilot error that killed all passengers and crew.

* a flight where an uncontained engine failure caused one passenger to be partially ejected from the aircraft and killed, but all other passengers survived after the plane successfully landed.

* a flight where pilot error caused the plane to land in a body of water short of the runway, where one passenger was not evacuated and drowned.

The correlation that is described in studies on birth rate changes say that as education levels, specifically the education levels of women, increase, the birth rate decreases.  A second relationship exists between education levels and income/wealth, but that second relationship is not necessarily causative of the first.  There are no more major, well known correlations than that. One theory of why that correlation exists could be that as women and their partners are more educated, they become more aware of how expensive having kids are, so they are less likely to have them. So I would say that reducing those expenses would allow educated people to have more kids."

Post hoc ergo propter hoc?

Could it not be said that the people who are more financially stable, thus more able to accumulate wealth, and thus are more wealthy, are the ones that didn't have kids since the current system makes it expensive to have kids?

Tax credits are only going so far when both parents work to be able to afford expensive homes and childcare is a major expense every month.  Therefore having kids is a net expense, not a net profit.

If publicly funded childcare was expanded, the costs of secondary education which are increasingly necessary were controlled, tax credits for kids were increased, and housing costs driven down by encouraging higher-density development in urban areas where people want to live, then I bet that the birth rate in Canada would explode.

I assumed that you wouldn’t call the police because of the threat of getting shot, yeah. Just like you mentioned.

I’m really not sure what type of fantasy or good feelings you think I have about any of this.

That’s not really a fantasy to me or something that I feel good about, I think that’s just how things work.
