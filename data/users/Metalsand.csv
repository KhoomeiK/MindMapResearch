The Alps are an Alpine Climate but an Alpine Climate is not exclusively located in the Alps.  The term ""Alpine"" refers to an Alps-like climate - they cover only a very narrow region of the world, and the term originates in Latin.  Given how [large the Alps are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps#/media/File:Alpenrelief_01.jpg) it's likely the climate was originally believed to be unique to that geographical location and since they are so rare across the world in terms of size relative to the Alps, it probably also made them appear like ""mini Alps"" or ""alps-like"" since they didn't share the same magnitude as the Alps."

I can understand the logic behind a fee - cashless transactions are much quicker, and holding onto cash is annoying in terms of making sure you have enough change, making sure it's safe and not being siphoned or stolen, etc.  

I would be willing to bet that similar to gas stations, they were probably charging 5 times or more greater than what the actual cost difference was.  

Also, it only affects restaurants and retail.  Other businesses are unaffected.

However, debit cards are legally considered cash transactions and shitty banks such as Wells Fargo are by far not the only option for consumers - there are occasionally good banks, but more to the point, there's an entirely different category of financial institution that actually focuses on consumer goodwill and not profit: Credit Unions.  In fact, they are non-profit by definition in order to serve as a community service.  I've never heard of a Credit Union that even charges you to have an account unlike many other banks - with my credit union there is no minimum balance, you still get a savings interest rate, they allow fee-less overdrafting (to a limit, and ofc requiring repayment within the month).

With that said - what the fuck are you on about?  

Now, NYC may be a different thing, but not only are there banks that do not charge fees for savings/checking accounts, but there are another class of financial institution called ""Credit Unions"" which are entirely non-profit in nature.  

Like I said, I can't speak for NYC - I live in an ordinary-sized city and NYC counties have the highest population density in all of America.  For all I know, they might even have laws that explicitly ban Credit Unions because of whatever reason.

Anyone who believes this is a moron, since Germany of all people is not one to whitewash history - they solemnly ensure that all Germans know very well all of the atrocities caused by Nazisim, and to that extent have laws that prevent encouraging any form of it.  

It was due to these laws that gave exceptions for ""arts"" but implicitly not video games that was an issue.  Particularly due to an early court ruling for Wolfenstein 3D that required censorship out of fear that the predominantly young playerbase could grow up to believe Nazism or Nazi symbols were remotely OK.  This made a legal basis for preventing distribution specifically with video games until the later 2018 ruling overturned it.  

It's also worth noting that there have been TV shows and movies who have been refused classification previously (preventing public air or theater showings) until they censored such content.

Not entirely correct - it *should* have, but video games being considered as art is more of a relatively recent change.

Honestly, the article takes a quite shallow, pessimistic examination at Amazon particularly.  While Amazon is known to bully suppliers to give them better prices, the Prime shipping is actually largely a matter of a complicated and efficient logistics process, backed by their new system that is essentially app-driven Uber but for Amazon next-day prime shipping.  If a warehouse has what you need, they can organize a next-day shipping for it.  The warehouse likely has what you need months in advance because Amazon uses data metrics from user purchases to estimate what it should stock in any given area.  

None of this is mentioned or accounted for in the article - they just say ""oh well Amazon just wants to drive competitors out of business"".  Which...doesn't quite make sense because not only is AWS their main cheese nowadays, but Amazon is a retailer.  A lot of their arguments on Amazon are in fact, speculative.  

Amazon *could* try to push only their brand at-cost prices only to raise them after there is no competition (except for the fact that there are so many alternatives listed that are often near or even better value propositions).  Amazon *could* raise pricing on prime accounts in the future as a result of the next-day shipping (they won't though, because they're not losing money on it as the author assumes).

For example on a PC, if the PSU isn't sending power, you could perhaps open it up and check the fuse, but repairs past that for the average cheap PSU won't be worthwhile.  

Louis Rossman and Mac/iPhone repair is, or depending on your definition was in part a scenario where those replacement parts were both unavailable, and exceedingly expensive individually.  You don't see with laptops or PCs as a professional business because these difficulties don't exist.  It's also worth noting that Macbooks don't change their engineering significantly per model and usually only have a few at a time - Louis Rossman himself cited that this is the reason he doesn't do PC repairs, because there's an absurdly greater number of variations and the parts aren't overpriced to the extent that Apple does.  Technically, Louis Rossman charges much higher labor costs than your average technician - you only save money because Apple-certified part swapping is so overpriced.  

Another thing about replaceable parts with cars vs computers - car parts are subject to a lot more wear and tear than computer parts.  Furthermore, unlike with computers, cars don't become twice as energy efficient and powerful in addition to shedding 20-30% of their previous weight every 5 years, unlike laptops have.

It was a mixed bag - one of the amusing examples is that one of the practices of that day was to reclaim book pages by washing the ink off.  Nearly two millennia before calculus was invented, there was a [book written that contained what can be considered a precursor to calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes_Palimpsest) that offered solutions for many of it's problems.  However, a monk had reclaimed the book in order to fill it with religious hymns instead.  

Conversely however, the only reason many of these books lasted so long was because there were monks that lived their entire lives copying books and maintaining libraries.  

Furthermore, monks were a huge source of scientific study - the first theory of evolution was penned independent from Charles Darwin by a monk who was trying to determine how life developed on Earth and was supported by the Catholic Church.  The concept of evolution being incompatible with religion is largely seen in the US and not nearly as often in any other parts of the world.

Most notably, it's the parents who file these charges in almost every scenario, meaning this isn't so much of a problem with meeting some random in a bar.  From the situations I've heard, when there is an innocent person affected, it's typically been vindictive parents who file it against a boyfriend/girlfriend who is unaware of the age of the minor at the time.  

The law was put into place because there were vastly more situations where people wormed their way out of a charge they deserved more than those who were innocent and harmed as a result. 

One other thing to note - these laws vary dramatically from state to state.  There isn't really a federally applicable law in the US for this in part because it didn't historically exist, and has changed over time (and rightly so, I should add).  One of the important factors in this was women's rights in general - before women began to be treated more equally, statutory rape between an older man and a girl was treated more as ""property loss"" due to loss in virginity (historically girls were often thought of as less capable than men, and the concept of dowry was in part a way of the family with the profitable son to compensate the family for raising an unprofitable daughter).

explainlikeimfive,fezrv7c,t1_feymfyp,1579460847.0,"The bigger issue is that HDMI has more signal loss (in large part due to no error checking).  While there are HDMI 2.1 connections you can do with 4k 60hz, you can't maintain them over the theoretical unofficial max length of 50ft HDMI.  If you lower the resolution (and consequently the bandwidth) you can make it to 50ft.  The official HDMI length is something around 15ft but you can usually safely get away with 20-25ft if you're sending 1080p.  

Ethernet has less signal loss over distance due to different types of cables and organization of those cables - to the extent that they make CAT6 to HDMI converters to leverage the many advantages of CAT6 to send HDMI signals over up to 330ft.  They're hella expensive though - around $120 for even the cheaper sets.  

Also, one other thing I'd like to say - technically, we do primarily use Ethernet for video - just not 1:1 connections.  There are technologies such as Remote Desktop that work great over the high bandwidth LAN connections, and with video file streaming, we're moving the video data required at any given time to then be pushed out via more ordinary formats.  

One other thing to note: HDMI and DVI share a common ancestry - HDMI is actually 1:1 backwards compatible with DVI.  Of course, you're limiting the bandwidth to HDMI 1 and losing audio/network data capabilities though.  However HDMI's video data is sent in an identical form as DVI did.

Another thing to note: HDMI is...well, to put it simply, all over the place.  48Gbps is more of the ""lab conditions"" maximum - the actual measurements can vary depending on a variety of factors.  Similar to Thunderbolt 3 which supports 40Gbps you need a special cable, the length is even more limited and the cable is hella expensive.  Consumer-grade HDMI is still somewhere around 20 Gbps.

Cat5e is about as relevant as VGA is nowadays.  Sure, it still gets sold and packaged with things, but no modern business with any sense would still be running 5e lines unless they're the cheapest option in town.  The only place you should be seeing Cat5e is on endpoints that don't need the bandwidth.  Cat6 is the standard with modern networking, with the exception of individual lines of course.

USB 3.0 isn't exactly modern either; that's several standards behind.  USB 3.1, often implemented in USB-C setups supports 10 gbps (assuming you're using a proper cable to get the speed doubling).  Thunderbolt 3 supports 20 gbps.  

You could have elaborated on how HDMI is actually a throwback to old video formats - HDMI is pin-to-pin backwards compatible with DVI for example.  You could have elaborated on how the primary difference is that Ethernet controllers have a lot of data integrity checks to prevent errors, whereas HDMI is a ""dumb"" connection.  You could have talked about how HDMI signal loss can occur after 15 feet depending on bandwidth used (low bandwith low interference HDMI signals can typically go up to 50 feet before the signal is too weak to be received).  You could have talked about the voltage and amperage differences between USB and Ethernet, and how USB is a serial connection whereas Ethernet is a manner of parallel that dedicates different pins to different tasks.

Oooh - The Witcher 3, albeit another game with an asterisk.  The entire game is centered around true good and true evil not being a thing, and while most of the quests are fairly straightforward, you often run into decisions to make where neither choice is ""good"" and you have to sort of figure out what you think is most right for yourself.

That may have been the last straw, and a flimsy straw at that, but typically the reality is that he was probably on trial for theft before and was narrowly put on a 6 month probationary period instead of serving jail time.  

One of the key parts of probation is that if you commit ANY crime during that period, all of the charges that you would have had if not for the probation are now applied at once.  

This is the most logical explanation by far.  Furthermore - if it really was just $3 of lunch meat and he wasn't on probation or other extenuating circumstances, ignoring how he would have grounds to sue them, I would absolutely be able to find this story posted all over the place for the same reasons that it was so heavily upvoted.  

However, the fact that no news crews picked it up doesn't just mean that it's likely that he glazed over the extenuating circumstances.

The only way they'd ignore such a good story is if it was blatantly false.

Games,feo4c6t,t1_fennnjr,1579294991.0,"> I mean how can they say that when they for example changed the ancient art on vases in Origins to be historically inaccurate, yet politically inclusive of women? That's a pretty clear political stance isn't it? And a weird one too, because any girl feeling reassured by not all history being male focused will eventually learn its a lie, and it looses it's historical value as well for others. Anyway, that's not the point. The point was: it is a pretty clear stand, whether they wanna acknowledge it or not.

I understand your point, but after considering it for a little while, I think this only gets split into two camps: those who favor realism and accuracy of historical events, and those who use them more as a backdrop in a more fantastical approach.  

In both WWI and WWII there is a lot of racism towards US Black citizens who signed up or were drafted to serve.  However, the reason that we don't see this in games like COD2 is because for one, those stories are focused on the more simple notion of ""us"" vs ""them"" and typically demonize Germany as all hateful nazis whereas the Wehrmacht was actually comprised of drafts and volunteers outside of Germany itself.  

The second reason though, is because we're not comfortable with how ""backwards"" we were back then and I'd argue this is the main reason.  They're not trying to bring to life the exact historical accounts, but rather the ""breath"" of the accounts.  It's an idealized version of historical events, and thus the more equal representation is one of those editorials to make the world more ""comfortable"" since it's designed as a story made in modern times for modern people.  It's not designed as a historical record.  Going further, it's extremely rare for a game to be fairly realistic in this aspect - I can only think of two medieval games that really highlight how disadvantaged a woman in medieval times was.  Mount and Blade (which allowed you to play as a woman) and Kingdom Come: Deliverance.  Even in Mount and Blade, the depiction of battle was an exaggeration of the carnage that it truly was, where you can have your main character eventually level up to be a portable hack-n-slash extinction event.  My point being that games pick and choose what they want to take and leave out when it comes to history largely for the purpose of an engaging story.  After all, writing misogynistic or racist characters who aren't inherently depicted as evil is very depressing for a developer compared to making them a more shoe-boxed character."

My folks have kitchen appliances they got from their wedding that see daily use and are still going strong.
>

Planned obsolescence exists, but not remotely as much as is blamed.  People typically prefer cheaper, disposable goods to expensive albeit long lasting.  This concept goes waaaay back to even around the late 1800's.  I'm unable to find the attribution, but one of the points it posited were that cheap boots with cardboard insoles would cost less than the more expensive boots, but the expensive boots would last far more time.  The initial cost of the expensive boots would be significant, but as they'd last far longer, the more expensive boots (assuming they are properly maintained) would actually save several times more money in the long run.  Planned obsolescence in reality is very rare because this would primarily be done by limiting replacement parts or self-servicing as opposed to making less durable products.  Tractors and iPhones are among the only products in the last decade or so to actually be designed in such a way to require premature replacement.  

Advertising is actually interesting historically - there are a FUCKTON of pro-consumer protections that have developed against false and misleading advertising, of which nearly none existed 100 years ago.  The big issue right now is that the legislation is struggling to keep up with the technology - Facebook for example, where you can have targeted advertising while not inherently insidious as a concept*, is being applied in an advertising campaign where some of the purchasers are not even in the same country, and the ads don't even have to be regarding a product.  

*Ex. instead of having ads shown to 100 random people who may or may not like soda, show it to 100 people who are interested in soda brands.  That way, the consumer isn't bombarded by advertisements that don't apply to them.  The methods they use to refine their targeting are primarily the insidious parts, such as the Facebook Mobile App being more invasive than actual, legitimate malware and adware."

Not to mention, it's not going to be an ordinary liquid battery - they only use lithium polymer in small electronics such as those.  While lithium polymer has other increased risk of hazard, it uses tiny, flat sections of lithium gel which isn't going to leak out to the extent that lithium would.  Lithium gel isn't pressurized like lithium batteries are, and doesn't have corrosion issues.  

Ignoring all of this, the vast majority of battery hazards are only if it gets lodged in the esophagus.  They still advise to go to a doctor if you swallow a battery just in case there are complications, but the majority of incidents with fatalities and injuries involve choking.

World War III is incredibly unlikely, and I agree that it's a 0% chance Iran is going to openly start fighting the US.  Though, at risk of being lumped in with the overdramatic responses thus far, I would caution you to remember that World War I was started because of a chain reaction of various tensions all beginning with an Austria that as evidence suggested Austria was well aware that the Archduke was not assassinated by Turkey, however it gave them a perfect excuse to try and do some empire building and claim some land.  

Do I think WWIII is remotely likely at this point?  Haha, no.  However, it's not to be taken lightly as your tone suggests - the whole reason the US is even in the region is to reduce tensions (albeit for self interests) and get Iran to be more open to global, not provoke them.  I would also say that Trump isn't the problem here, nor any specific person.  I think what it cost the US to enact that latest strike may not have been worth it, though as I'm obviously not directly involved, I can't say that there aren't parameters I may not be aware of."

The system in America is absolute dogshit, and it has so many holes and broken components that perhaps it should be tossed out entirely to be rebuilt from scratch.  However, there's this common misconception that copying another working system would free us of healthcare problems entirely, which particularly won't be the case if a lot of the preconditions such as high costs of hospital stays and high costs of medication are allowed to stay.  

Personally, I believe based on what I've read that the main problems are having to do with a lack of regulation with regards to insurance companies and health care providers.  Fixing those problems should be considered paramount before even considering any other aspects of the system."

The sad part is that I actually have a good deal on my insurance too - I have friends that are paying even more.  It's not impossible that the government tries to put a hybrid subsidization similar to health care for transportation where you have to prove you either have an insured working car you pay for on your own or you have a subscription to one of these services.

Games,fcxlaqa,t1_fcx9x7j,1578065687.0,"> SQ42 was supposed to be released a couple of years ago. At this point I think most people assume it's vaporware.

Vaporware is pretty disingenuous, no matter how you feel about how marketing has prostituted the game or how overly optimistic they've been about release dates.  Two years ago, [they released an hour of Squadron 42 gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5Q-QFvFHxg) and they've released plenty of WIP of various aspects that show there is a lot of content under the hood.  

With regards to the original timed goals - early on CIG kept on moving the goal post to match the rate of funding.  When they split Squadron 42 and Star Citizen proper, it was because SQ42 was no longer the brief adventure it was originally planned as.  

In a perfect world, CIG would fire their marketing team for whoring out the game and giving it such a bad reputation, refocus their goals to be more narrow in scope and to attempt to broaden them post-release instead perhaps.  However, Chris Roberts, bless his soul, is like Peter Molyneux in that he both dreams and ""sells"" a grand world - he truly believes that he can achieve this, and in some respects, his vision is not illogical.  Following the expansion of the goals to be ten times the game it was originally planned to be, having a 5 year delay is expected - however, while much progress has been made, it's still not close to where it needs to be.  There's been a lot of development, but based on their own roadmap, a finished product is still not expected until 2021 or 2022, lol.  

Also, in a perfect world, people would stop being fanatics and conversely, claims that it's vaporware, which are wholly unsubstantiated would stop occurring.  Optimally, people would just wait it all out and stop praising or deriding it.  However, it keeps on coming up constantly."

pcmasterrace,fcotb6g,t1_fcnlwz9,1577840973.0,"It looks like he skims over some of the reasons why they classify it as such, however.  You can trade or sell a car for example, but unlike cars, software is easily copied and duplicated.  The legal definition of software ownership would entitle the recipient to the same rights as physical product ownership - which would be problematic as you could simply resell software you purchase.  

Since redefining legal terms is time extensive, and of course legal proceedings are usually a generation behind on account of how thorough they are, developers and companies instead opted to use existing code to define the software they sold as ""usage licenses"" or leases in perpetuity.  This has existed for decades, and the concept of usage licenses when it comes to software ownership almost predates the existence of modern internet itself.  

Now, one thing that often confuses people when it comes to this legal construct is that a perpetual lease is just another form of property - timeshares for example are a perpetual lease that can be bought and sold.  

However, with the advent of online services, unlike a time share you no longer have the ability to transfer these usage licenses unlike other forms of property.  I should note that Software as a Service is NOT the same concept as the ""usage license"".  Software as a Service always entails a fee for use of the service - Google Stadia uses a hybrid of this model as it requires a regular fee for use of Stadia and the purchase of the individual games on it's platform.  

**TLDR;** Legal definitions are different than dictionary definitions, and the concept of software licenses as opposed to software ownership exists due to gaps in legal code, but has generally equated to product ownership - the only difference being that modern implementations such as Steam are really skirting the rules by disallowing the ability to transfer these ""perpetual leases"".

**TLDR;;TLDR;** [Car ownership = software usage licenses] however, over time companies have overstepped what is legally permissible"

Bear in mind, labor costs are usually a HUGE chunk of any company's operating costs.  When properly implemented, it's actually cheaper to prevent defects entirely rather than pay for quality assurance since product defects are usually the result of a defect within the process or machinery.  

If they suspect their entire line of units is compromised, and the problem is cropping up enough that the expensive and time consuming process to receive a complaint, verify, and ship out a new unit is too expensive, they'll do mass-rollouts as well.  

What makes this unique is that they removed the old variants from service remotely via software as opposed to the ordinary and far more expensive method of physically removing the product to ensure it leaves circulation."
