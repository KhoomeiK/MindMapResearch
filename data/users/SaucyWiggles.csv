Polygon actually described Tarkov as ""a hit"" in spite of the developers, which I believe is the article you're referencing. You should take just a half step back from this comment and wonder why you've tied up the developers' personal identities with the game itself. They can make bad choices and still make a great game, and it obviously is a huge hit.

Nope! I want my money back, and CIG has pledged to return it as long as I requested it back within 30 days of buying their product. I have, and now I wait.

He was unequivocally a genius. He pioneered web.py, is often credited as the architect behind Creative Commons licensing, designed Markdown with John Gruber, and helped create RSS online. He did most of this before he was 20, and while working on the technology that made reddit possible he was barely even a teenager. He was a notable activist for most of his young life in protecting internet freedom. When he was 19 he developed what eventually became reddit, and is commonly listed as a co-founder. It's my understanding that for a long time reddit has tried to walk this title back and won't acknowledge his existence.

He committed suicide after MIT threw him to the wolves (MA's DA) for downloading data (scientific articles from JSTOR) on their campus with the intent to widely distribute it for free. Speaking literally, this is not against the rules. JSTOR dropped their initial charge and MIT shut their mouths tight and didn't say anything when the DA came after him.
