AskReddit,ffev0od,t3_et2ewc,1579866737.0,"My old roommate in college. 

She was this 4'11"", 160 lb monster, who sat on the living room couch all day watching jersey shore and teen Mom. She was really mean when you weren't on her good side (I wasn't) so to stay on her good side, my other two roommates just did whatever she wanted, when she wanted them too. She made one girl walk all the way down from our 3rd floor dorm, out through the parking lot, to grab a case of water from her car bc she didn't want to walk. She used everybody's stuff and didn't ask, she left her stupid ass baby shoes all over the place and would just throw her jacket anywhere. She didn't take out trash so the room piled up and smelt bad. Whenever I left I was *constantly* scared she was going to poison my fish. She talked shit about all of us, said how weird and stupid we were. She would print her homework at 7am and for some reason it always took 30 minutes for her to do this, despite the fact she could have easily printed it the night before when she finished the paper. I had an iPod touch that lost once. I assumed it had fallen between the wall and the bed and I didn't care enough to dig it out. Then it randomly turned up in my dresser drawer one morning. It was later revealed to me by one of the other roommates that the bitch just took it and hid it to see how long it would take me to ask if anyone had seen it. When I never asked, she got bored I guess and put it back. She would tell the other roommates how when I got back from class she was going to punch me in the face when I walked in (she never did lol) and how I was going to get pregnant and drop out of school (she was the only one in the dorm who had 1) had sex and 2) was actively having sex on a regular basis). She never said anything to me, not a single word, except for the one time she asked me if I was a virgin (I was) and then made fun of me for it. 

When she was gone, the rest of us got along amazingly. One of the girls she bossed around told us that she wished it had just been us without the bitch and that we'd of all be friends. But that girl cast such a long and dark shadow over the dorm it was hard to escape. 

Most of what I learned about her (like the things she said about me when I wasn't there and the thing with the iPod) were told to me by one of the roommates, after she got into a fight so bad with the bitch that she finally stopped talking to her too. She and I became friends just because we had no one else to talk to in the dorm."

notliketheothergirls,ffe3rdb,t1_ffdei84,1579835928.0,"I agree with everything you said with the Mary Sue trope, however I don't think that was the point of the comment. 

I used to read A LOT of fan fiction as a teen lol and the Mary Sue character was inescapable. The thing is though, a lot of those poorly written characters in fanfiction communities are written by young people, who aren't always the best writers, maybe even it's their first time trying to write something seriously. Maybe they never even heard the term ""Mary Sue"" until they started reading fanfiction. I know I never heard of it before fanfiction, but I was also 12 so why would I? You don't know how to analyze literature when you're 12, heck, you probably don't even know how to do it when you are 16. I majored in English and it took me until 22 to feel like I was actually doing it properly. And despite majoring in English, am I a good fiction writer? NOPE. Learning how to write good fiction and well written characters takes time and practice. And the truth is, if you're a young girl writing fanfiction, you probably aren't taking it that seriously. That's who the post was talking about, the ""young girls"" who write fanfiction because they have a huge crush on the main character, and just want to live out their fantasies and have to write their own stories to do it. It's not always good writing and the characters aren't always fully developed, but it's fun for them and that's all that matters. 

That's not to say it's impossible to find really well written fan fiction, because it isn't. There's some good shit out there if you spend enough time reading. And some fanfiction writers go on to be real authors because they realize it's their passion. But everyone starts somewhere, and sometimes that somewhere is writing shitty underdeveloped characters as a form of wish fulfillment."

fatlogic,ffbp4r9,t3_esqqw3,1579776687.0,"I agree with this one 100%. Unless the person's told you ahead of time (ie opened up the conversation about their weight) that they're gonna be trying to lose weight, then imo there's no reason to comment on someones weight like that. 

I say that bc in college I was very depressed and very poor and couldn't afford to eat. I was down to a BMI of about 17. It was awful, and ladies I worked with would always compliment me for being skinny but it was embarrassing for me. 

So unless you know that the weight loss was something they were trying to achieve, I agree, you shouldn't compliment it. They might be going through something they don't want to talk about. Plus I know when you have an actual ED, weight comments can be very triggering, so best to just avoid it."

Maybe this is gonna seem stupid but back in college I was at a bonfire and we were sharing ghost stories. This guy basically told us a story about his aunt back in Mexico, when she was a kid (like 6 maybe), she went missing for a month out in the mountains in some Mexican forest. Their family lived on a ranch and one day she just wandered off. Everyone from their village/town went looking for her for weeks. Nothing. She randomly showed up a month later barefoot, talking about how the ""duende"" took care of her in the forest and how she had only been gone for a few hours, only escaped when she snuck away from them. She was also barefoot and had suffered some trauma. It was scary bc he was really hyping up the duende (which I had never heard of before). Everyone there was Mexican except me and they all swore the duende were real (though tbh they might have been trying to scare me lol).

If you say something about race or gender that goes against the accepted perspective of the white man, you get downvoted. Reddit doesn't like to talk about race issues or gender issues and when they do, it's always ""well I'm a lower class white man so I understand the struggle of black people"" or ""well sure, women get sexually asualted, but men also struggle with abuse"" and it's like, yes, I agree men do get abused, but we are talking about women on this post. If you want to talk about men, make a new post. It seems like there is a lack of empathy for anyone who isn't young, white, male and straight and who doesn't want to talk about how women are manipulative, or race issues don't exist.

I was super quiet and shy as a kid. Because of that I was always excluded from group convos because it's hard to just jump in. I still don't do super well in groups but when I'm in a position where im with someone who is unfamiliar with the group, or is the ""outsider"" in the conversation or with someone I know is just shyer and quieter than me, I go out of my way to talk to them, bring them into the conversation, and make sure at least one person is listening to them and is interested in talking/making them feel welcome to the group. No one ever did that for me when I was younger so now I try to be that person for others. But even as an adult, it still happens.

Went to a bar once with my ex boyfriend and he walked in before I did but it turns out it was an hour before closing and they weren't letting anymore people in, and the bouncer put his hand on my ex's chest to stop him from walking any further, then without saying anything shook his head no and pointed to the door. Tbh I was pissed because first of all don't put your hands on another person, you can just say, we aren't letting anyone else in right now. Second of all, calm down. Like the bouncer was standing inside the entrance (because it was cold) so you had to actually walk in to even know you weren't allowed to walk in. Like if it's that big of a fucking deal then stand outside jerk. 

Not to mention all of the times in college I tried to go into this one bar and wasn't fully dressed up, they give you the up and down look like they're deciding whether or not to let trash in. Despite the fact that this is a farm town and a literal shithole. Everyone here is trash so stop playing. 

Plus they never seem to help you when you need them too. I had a guy follow me around the bar once yelling about how I'm going to go to hell because I wouldn't give him my phone number after he bought me a drink. Went to security and they didn't do shit. Had to hide in the women's bathroom for like 30 minutes hoping he would give up. Yet the one time I leaned against a wall I supposedly wasn't supposed to lean against, they almost kicked me out."

Stop judging people, for better or worse. Even if you think that person is straight up weird. I'll let you in on a little secret, weird people can be some of the nicest you will ever meet, and some of the funnest to hang out with. But also, just because someone seems like they have their life together, and look good on the outside, you don't know what they are struggling with on the inside. You are no better and no worse than anyone else. 

Always be honest even when you think it will hurt someones feelings. HOWEVER, when you are being honest, do it with tact, compassion and empathy. There's no reason to be hurtful. And stick to your word. If you say you're gonna do something or be somewhere, do it, and be on time. Make people sure they can rely on you.

I had only seen Twilight before that so it was a big difference to see her play a different character, made me think she was actually a good actor. 

And if it makes any difference, I don't think any of the cast of twlight really liked the twilight movies. I think specifically Robert Pattinson did it because he knew it would eventually allow him to work on more artsy and Indy type movies which I think is what he prefers."

There are other actors who do this too (off the top of my head, George Clooney) and it makes it really hard to watch their films, but Cara is the hardest for me. But at least with a George Clooney movie, you usually know what type of character he's gonna play, and you kinda know what you're getting. I appreciate the fact that Cara *seems* to try to play different characters/different roles. At least, the movies I've seen her in have all been very different. Idk if she's been typecast yet bc I made a point to stop watching her movies after Valerian so if she's gotten better I'd be interested in giving her another chance."

EXACTLY there is this huge push right now to ""normalize"" women having sex because for years it's been something that women had to shy away from talking about... And that's great! That really important! But the thing is is that it makes those of us with sex related issues feel really not-normal because suddenly there is such a magnifying glass on an aspect of our lives that we struggle with. 

I am all for sex positivity, but I wish women were able to talk about sex without feeling the need to add qualifiers, or prove some point. And invading another woman's personal boundaries of what they are willing/open to talk about, is not sex positive."

All of them and myself had been sexually assaulted in some form, at some point, and all of us were younger than 23 sharing our stories. 

Just about every girl I talk to also has a story about sexual assualt. 

I personally find sex hard to talk about, for various reasons, including the things that happened in college. I know I would struggle with that challenge. I didn't like when they said that's what they would be doing because why should someone who has a hard time talking about sex, whether it be because of an assualt, because of the morals/family they were raised in, or for some other personal reason (God forbid you just don't like talking about such an intimate thing with strangers) be punished if they don't want to share? Or be forced into talking about something they aren't comfortable sharing. The bachelor the last few seasons has had such a weird hangup regarding sex and I'm getting kinda tired of it. I don't particularly care how many times Peter and Hannah had sex. If I was one of those girls, I wouldn't want to hear about it for sure. And I wouldn't want all the girls I'm competing against to know any bit of my own sexual history. It's not for them, it's for my partner. Interested to see how the next episode plays out."

thebachelor,fdjfz2y,t1_fdj1r3c,1578469151.0,"Honestly I felt the producers, bc when they noticed Luke was manipulative and honestly unhealthy in the way he conducted himself on the show, they should have persuaded her away from him instead of egging her in his direction week after week. Like that time she was about to leave him on the cliff, and they said ""you have to decide for yourself"" like that's bullshit and they should have cared more about their leads mental health to try to remove him from the show. They knew how he was acting and how much distress he was causing her long before that point. 

So much of her season was bogged down with Luke drama that I don't feel like she really got a fair shot until towards the end and that's why she made the wrong decision (let alone the fact that they really should have vetted people better, like how could they not know Jed was dating someone already??) I honestly think if the producers had done their job better, she would have ended up with the right person, whether or not that would have been Peter."
