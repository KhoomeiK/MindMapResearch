aww,fffkxtx,t1_ffepgo3,1579886198.0,Tiktok has an option to share the video as a gif so it's easier to just share it directly than save it and upload it.
sandiego,ffb1x0n,t1_ff6fkw6,1579749735.0,"In four years in the military my highest paying year I made just barely over $17,000. But yeah sure they get paid really well 🙄"

audiodrama,ff7lswx,t3_erwi04,1579652607.0,Thank you. I just screamed at my husband that it came out because he's been bugging me for the past few days about it lol
KidsAreFuckingEvil,ff6hyjo,t1_ff40jo5,1579627592.0,"Personally, when I was a kid, I watched dudes hit their friends in the nuts all the time so I never once thought it was THAT painful. I asked my older brother about it and he told me how bad it really was."
interestingasfuck,ff4qj4x,t1_ff4qbz1,1579570029.0,Yeah that's true but you just turn the marks or whatever away from whoever you're hiding it from
pics,ff4gou8,t1_ff4glqv,1579563177.0,"JFC... The abuser won't see what they use. They would never see the piss cup. Unless they're in the bathroom with them, which is a no go when you're giving a urine sample."
pics,ff4g0gz,t1_ff4fppy,1579562716.0,"...the markers are in the bathroom. You don't bring your own. Like I said, all clinics are different. This is just ONE example of what ONE clinic is doing."
pics,ff4eyfv,t1_ff4epf8,1579562002.0,"This is one facilities way of helping. This isn't in all clinics. Also, the cup of pee stays in the bathroom so even if the abuser somehow knows it's there, they have no way of knowing what was written."
pics,ff3st9p,t1_ff3sn3g,1579548086.0,That's the same thing. It's a code. This clinic chose to do colors. Other clinics might do numbers or letters.
pics,ff3rwsv,t1_ff3qy3x,1579547532.0,You're a piece of shit. Blaming a victim for being scared to speak up?

AskReddit,ff3joga,t3_er59yq,1579542484.0,"My husband streams on twitch so when we were playing sea of thieves together and were on Discord, some kid popped up in his stream and starting calling me a cunt and a stupid fucking bitch and how I had no idea what I was doing (we were literally just fucking around sailing to another island). Then he proceeded to go into detail about how he would fuck me. My husband finally looked over at chat and just said ""dude that's my wife"" and the kid just left. He obviously got blocked immediately after but just damn."
pics,ff3iwsb,t1_ff3iqu9,1579542011.0,"Listen dude you can laugh all you want but things like this work but gives abuse victims a way to voice their need for help without actually having to say they need help. Just because you can't get it through your thick skull, doesn't mean it's invalid."
pics,ff3hsuk,t1_ff3hp19,1579541337.0,"You've clearly never met an abuse victim. The abuser has so much power over them and they live in so much fear that they can't just ask for help.
Also those cups are tiny and literally only have room for initials"
pics,ff3ha74,t1_ff2zt8k,1579541008.0,The cup gets left in the bathroom. The abuser never sees it.
pics,ff3gvaj,t1_ff32h57,1579540763.0,"When was the last time you went to the doctor and someone's partner, abusive or not, went into a restroom with them? The urine sample never leaves the bathroom and this isnt in every facility. Maybe a handful have it in the entire country."
pics,ff3glin,t1_ff2no3v,1579540611.0,There is no way for the abuser to know this is even hung up in the bathroom of the facility. This is just an example of one facilities way of helping.
interestingasfuck,ff3a62m,t1_ff2nksi,1579537233.0,The cup never leave the bathroom. Plus this is one clinic with no location listed. It's not like this is going on all over the country.
interestingasfuck,ff2ldmm,t1_ff2iw5n,1579511600.0,This is in a bathroom and the urine sample is left in the bathroom on the back of the toilet. How exactly is the abuser supposed to know if the victim used this system?
interestingasfuck,ff2l60e,t1_ff2gzp5,1579511287.0,That's 100% false. There are plenty of phone numbers with 911 somewhere inside of them.

AmItheAsshole,fenih0d,t3_eq12gk,1579285398.0,NAH. I contacted my biological brother when I was younger in fucking Myspace of all places. He didn't believe me and wanted nothing to do with me. It pissed me off but I understood why and respected his decision. I haven't tried to contact him or our sister since.
HumansBeingBros,fenf1u3,t1_fendwrc,1579283298.0,It literally says in the video he was waiting for the dog to get to a spot where he would grab him. Him jumping in the water completely unprepared with at least a 6-foot drop would just endanger both of them instead of helping the dog.

Pets,fdpx8hy,t3_emjr3z,1578644342.0,"Unfortunately Southern California is stupid expensive for vet bills. I live in San Diego and paid like $150 for my small pup to v just be seen and have his skin checked out. Same procedure at my in-laws in Texas, $42. That included testing, a shave, nails clipped, and medicated shampoo. 

Can you possibly see a vet in Arizona or Nevada? It might be significantly cheaper."

happycryingdads,fdljs11,t1_fdljm42,1578525602.0,I never said he's not allowed to be in uniform lol the only thing I said was that he needs to be in uniform regulations when in uniform but go off sis.
happycryingdads,fdlinwr,t1_fdlgggq,1578524861.0,You don't understand that this video can literally cause him to get in severe trouble with his job. I'm not saying that just to be an ass.
happycryingdads,fdlidzh,t1_fdlgggq,1578524684.0,"Well considering the fact that he's a baby in the military and would get his ass chewed if a video of him in uniform and unshaven went viral, yeah I'm pretty okay with warning his family about it since I have no idea whether he even knows this is on the internet."
happycryingdads,fdkr727,t1_fdkqz91,1578509454.0,"That's what I'm saying when people have absolutely nothing better to do. It's usually the people that have been in for way too long and should have retired already but they can't let go of being in the military because they have no meaning in their lives. I know that's hardly specific but it's usually the case lol 

I had my septum pierced when I was in the military and while I was on leave and in a different state someone tried to report me to my chain of command for having my septum ring in even though I wasn't in uniform nor did I ever wear it while I was in uniform. Fortunately my chain of commands literally didn't care at all."
happycryingdads,fdkqlu6,t1_fdkq8da,1578509105.0,It has nothing to do with America. I'm Polish and several of my cousins in Poland have served in the military there and every single one of them would tell you the same thing. If you're in uniform you have to abide by the uniform regulations whether you're on leave or not.
happycryingdads,fdkj7bh,t1_fdkihsk,1578504853.0,"If he's gonna be in uniform, he's gotta comply with uniform regulations. Hope no one in his COC is a dick and reams him for this.

Edit: I'm not pulling this out of my ass I was in the military too and my husband still active duty. I know people can be complete assholes. I'm genuinely hoping that no one sees this in this command. There's too many people in the military that don't have anything better to do."

natureismetal,fdba7pi,t1_fd813r1,1578255409.0,"I don't think it's unreasonable either. In this case the mother bird is just acting out of pure instinct. She needs her babies to survive and in order to do that she needed to remove the weakest link. 

Trust me, I know a lot about crows too. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of messing with one and for the next several months, until I brought a peace treaty, the entire flock messed with me daily. Never again lol"
natureismetal,fdb9qpq,t1_fd8hfmw,1578255230.0,Cats and dogs both typically eat the runt directly after giving birth because they need instant energy in order to start producing milk for the rest of the babies. My mother-in-law had a dog that had puppies a few months back and she unfortunately had to watch as the dog ate the puppy that was stillborn.
natureismetal,fdb88rh,t1_fd80r11,1578254825.0,Notice that I never said it's only something that happens in mammals or that birds never feel anything. I said it's typically a mammalian feature. My aunt had an African gray that was primarily attached to her husband and when her husband passed away the bird laid down on his pillow and passed away within 24 hours. Bonding happens in a lot of animals and it's amazing to watch.
natureismetal,fd7lu8y,t1_fd7lgx4,1578206475.0,The vast majority of animals don't feel remorse. That is primarily a mammalian feature. Typically when you see a bird that seems like they're mourning the loss of a chick it's usually because they're new parents and they don't understand that the chick is dead.
natureismetal,fd7lban,t1_fd7kzgd,1578206247.0,A lot of people give animals human characteristics to make themselves feel better and initially your comment seemed like that. I figured I'd give you the benefit of the doubt and actually explain it.
natureismetal,fd7l6i2,t1_fd7hh0u,1578206193.0,Raising babies takes a lot out of you and animals won't take care of the ones they don't think will survive. It's not worth their energy to feed a potentially sickly baby. By removing the runt the other two have a higher chance of surviving.
natureismetal,fd7ktgv,t1_fd79oe7,1578206047.0,"Animals, for the most part, dont know wrong and right. They know safe and unsafe. Also, she didn't hesitate. The baby for caught in the twigs and she was trying to push it past the twigs.

Edit: Baby ""got caught"" not ""for caught"" not quite sure how I ended up with that lol"
