took it out and left it on my desk set to never turn the screen off, battery fell to 1% and sat there for 3.5 hrs

NintendoSwitch,fed1caq,t3_eoe1mj,1578993738.0,"Update:
Seems battery is holding charge at 1% although its been sitting on my desk, unplugged with the screen on for over an hour now

Edit: close to 3.5 hrs of screen on time, still at 1% just sitting at the home screen

Edit 2:
After letting it sit for 3.5 hrs I turned it off completely and let it sit for 30 minutes before putting it back in the dock and letting it charge back up

I then left it sitting on my desk with the screen set to not turn off and left it for about 30-40 mintues, came back and it was only down to 86%

Thanks everyone for your advice and humor, it seems to be fixed now"

not only that but if someone doesnt know how to use them or someone who doesnt know what they want tries to use one in rush hour it just leads to congestion as they scroll through and decide


having worked both kfc and mcdonnalds point of sales, the layout of the registers is much faster for keying in orders than the kiosk, but not as user friendly.

having 1-2 video screens displaying rotating specials is fine but the standard menu should always be visable"
