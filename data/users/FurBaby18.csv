Instagramreality,fehe74t,t1_fefs4c5,1579114711.0,"It’s devastating honestly. Especially if you struggles with your self worth *BEFORE* aging. Now being a woman in my 40’s, I rarely will look at myself in the mirror or any reflective surface. And if I do it’s a tiny mirror showing my eyebrows/eyes only so I can (badly) draw them on. I’m working on seeing my value outside of beauty, but it’s hard."

LifeProTips,fclkpnj,t1_fckpt9k,1577750048.0,"I do that every single time I need to go to the doc. I am lucky enough to have vision, dental, and vision. For the medical part I have a 3k deductible. When I went to urgent care for a migraine (which I am on meds for but I still get hit with blinding ones that come out of nowhere) I got the bill and it was for $350. Then next time I went for a bad case of pleurisy I asked to pay in cash and it was $125  total for office visit and the xrays. The doctor even made sure I understood what the price was before doing any testing or injections. 

Honestly, I wouldn’t even have gotten insurance, but I’ve had a trend of a hospital stay once a year for the last 3 years. So I basically pay $250 a moth out of my paycheck for what I consider to be “catastrophic” insurance that I ONLY use for hospital visits and RX meds. 


Someone else in this thread said that America is broken. I agree wholeheartedly."
ChoosingBeggars,fcjensf,t1_fcivxqh,1577684897.0,"Have you worked in a call center? Because when talk to people about their past due accounts, you seriously lose all empathy for other humans. I just assume that no matter what they say, it’s complete and utter bullshit. You *have* to or you’d never get out of bed again."
