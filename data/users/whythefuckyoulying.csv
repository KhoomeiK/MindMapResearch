Ps: it's capable of scanning multiple pages into 1 single pdf. And if you want it to be a picture instead of pdf, take a screenshot of it"

AppleWatch,fdd2pyn,t1_fd7nqvf,1578292398.0,have you tried it personally? i got one that requires me to connect the original watch charger to the dock but the power keeps disconnecting for the apple watch. is the power output/input the problem? i tried it using the regular wall adaptor (not the 18w power brick).
AppleWatch,fdd1yeb,t3_ek3llc,1578291567.0,"i got one recently for someone for xmas. it is a 3 in 1 wireless charging dock. 2 wireless charging pads for iphones/airpods and one for the apple watch (you need to attach the watch charger to the dock still and attach the ac cord to the dock to power it up). i tried it once for a short while and it worked well. however when it came to really charging a phone and a watch, it failed. the charging for the watch disconnected frequently and was almost useless. however the charging for the phone worked well and now we just use it for charging our phones wirelessly. my friend had multiple charging docks for iphones+watch and they almost never worked. i think im done buying 3in1 charging docks for now  as i had scoured through hundreds of reviews and products but alas. this is inevitable. lol"
