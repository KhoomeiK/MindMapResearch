If Tinder thought allowing a similar thing was a smart business move and labeled accounts as payment based before you swiped, I would have no issue with that, because it accurately sets the expectation.


I'm not salty at all, and I'm not hating on people who sell sex. What I am saying is that it is disingenuous and rude to solicit someone to pay for your services in an environment where people are expecting a non-monetary connection."
Tinder,ffcr2wi,t1_ffcpucr,1579805500.0,"It's rude to assume that people on an app that is for dating want to have their potential partners ask them to pay for sexual services(whether it be of a physical nature or not).

Following your logic, the people unsolicitly advertising these services should have to pay the people they're advertising to for the time they have taken."

MurderedByWords,fel4mn9,t1_fel3wyt,1579213954.0,"The difference is Galileo was told he was wrong about objective physical phenomena, whereas the meaning of words is inherently subjective.

However, the number of people who believe a word has a definition is an objective thing. Can you link me to research that gives numerical evidence on the quantity of people who accept that all racism inherently has a power imbalance component?

Again, I'm not saying that systematic racism doesn't exist or isn't a problem, but that, in a colloquial setting, the singular term of racism encompasses more than this narrow definition. If what I say is true, then academics continuing to espouse the opposite will not be effective in their goals of bringing people together."
MurderedByWords,fel38td,t1_fel0j1j,1579213104.0,"The research you linked takes as fact the premise that all racism is inherently based on a power dynamic, and all of the work done is based on this. It is never questioned, and there is no evidence to support the idea that the socially accepted definition of racism is inherently linked to a power dynamic. A group of acedemics cannot choose to redefine a colloquially accepted definition of a word. 

That would be like a group saying all apples will now be called Granny Smith apples, and then doing a bunch of research into the characteristics of only the traditionally-defined Granny Smith apples based on this assumption, and then people using that research as evidence to say they were right in their definition all along.

But I suppose I might be lacking in scientific principals, I only have an engineering degree."
MurderedByWords,fekyf0g,t1_feky6n6,1579210186.0,Dismantling systematic racism with divisional rhetoric sounds pretty ineffective. Might want to stay away from attempting to get knee-jerk reactions by redefining words that have clearly established meaning

But systematic oppression is not the definition of racism. Racism is prejudice that is based on race.

Hijacking the definition for your own means only obstructs progress."
MurderedByWords,fekv3ju,t1_fekuwzn,1579208214.0,Systematic racism is a subcategory of racism that certainly has existed and still exists today. But to say that all racism is systematic is categorically false.

MurderedByWords,fekuhp9,t1_feks27b,1579207858.0,"This is grade A nonsense combined with some gaslighting. That person most certainly was not just talking about privilege and systematic expression. They said what they meant. They hate people based on skin color alone. 

Prejudice, by definition, is having preconcived ideas of an individual based on a group they can be considered members of. You know what the word for preconcived notions of a group based on race is? Racism. And it's not just limited to systematic oppression, individuals of all races are perfectly capable of being racist to others all on their own.

To say racism is only one way delegitimizes any claim to trying to progress society, and is only self-serving by putting a spotlight on the individual espousing divisional rhetoric."

facepalm,feeb83e,t1_fed99nx,1579030181.0,"Lol, it's obvious that it's okay to be white. The only people that feel the need to vocalize it are losers looking to get a rise out of people when they have no straws left to grasp at.

You're right about men's rights and white rights groups, though, they are very similar in the fact that while they could be focused on the few number of actual injustices against themselves, but in practice they just look to put down others to inflate their own egos.

Take a word of advice from a white man: trying to get a rise out of others and putting them down for your own gain does nothing but show your lack of personal worth."
