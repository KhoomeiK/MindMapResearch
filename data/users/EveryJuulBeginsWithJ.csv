He’d go days without texting me and I just thought he wanted his space so i’d let him be, and he’d hit me up to hang out about once every week where i’d hit him up to hang out about three times a week. I never even got jealous when he hung out with other girls because I trusted him. But I actively tried to engage in what he likes, I’d get him gifts that I know he would like, and I tried to be direct about what was bothering me in the relationship so we could try and change it. He never did any of that for me. I changed for him, he never changed for me but kept saying he would..."

Thing is, like I said in the original post, I brought this up to him, and like you said, he had no idea he was hurting me with this. So he promised he would text me every day while on winter break and he would call me. We talked for a week over winter break, before my therapist suggested I take a mental break to focus on myself and my family, he kept his promise on the texting, but didn’t initiate any calls. I told him he could still call me over my mental break, cause 1) I wanted to see if he would keep his promise, and 2) If he didn’t call, I wouldn’t have any contact with him for a whole 3 weeks. He just said “Thanks but i’ll let you have your you time”, which is respecting my wishes I suppose, but he still neglected that part of his promise, which leaves me conflicted. He’s not the best at communicating, which is my biggest issue, and I want to talk to him about this once break ends, but I feel like if I keep bringing up our issues (i’ve talked to him twice now about it, three times would be after break), he’ll see me as a burden/downer/annoying. I hope this made sense"
