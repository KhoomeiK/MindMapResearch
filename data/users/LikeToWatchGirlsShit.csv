I knew this girl who lived with her drunken boyfriend and she took her drunken boyfriend’s money away at the bar because he was spending their rent money on booze. So he chases her down and bites into the side of her head (yes like with his teeth, into her head.) She had to go to the hospital and get stitches in her head and face from him biting her so deep and hard. She looked like she got mauled by an animal for weeks. He went to jail. The whole time he was in jail she cried that she missed him and couldn’t wait until he could come home.
