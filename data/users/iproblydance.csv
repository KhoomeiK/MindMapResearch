AskWomen,ffnqfpt,t3_eu63yk,1580069363.0,"For me, it was not being afraid to spend time alone, and to find joy in that time by myself. And like others said, finding things to do on your own that are fun - like painting, or reading, or even going out for a run or to the mall. Things that make you feel good. 

Also, stopping the bad thoughts in their tracks, and questioning them, and being aware of negative behaviour and stopping yourself from doing it. Like if you know you're reaching out to someone for validation - stop yourself and ask yourself why you're doing that, and whether or not they can really give you what you need, or if you can find what you need inside yourself. You always can. 

Good luck OP. There's no right answer and there's no finish line - you just keep going, and keep improving, and learning to appreciate yourself in the way you deserve. <3"

AskReddit,ffkf2m7,t1_ffkek6d,1580021710.0,What is wrong with you? Why would you think it is ok to leave a comment like this? Who does this comment benefit? This person is taking incredible steps to improve their life and your response to them is “this isn’t going to end well”? You should be ashamed of yourself.
relationships,ffjgge1,t1_ffj6w3b,1579997723.0,"Wowww this is very eye opening. I’m attracted to emotionally unavailable people too, and when someone’s actually willing and interested in getting close to me I’m not as interested. Maybe this is something I need to explore more. Thank you for this"
AskReddit,ffjau9g,t3_ett7fr,1579994432.0,"Becoming attached at the hip to another person in high school. Dating them for years and letting them become my whole world, shutting out lifelong friends and making career choices because of that person. Completely changed the trajectory of my life and who I am as a person. I’m still trying to make friends, and I’ve finally stopped trying to fill the hole that person left. 

But it’s led me to make arguably bigger, worse choices - like trusting the wrong friends too easily, letting them in and believing they respected me the way I respected them. It led to one of my friends very badly hurting me both personally and professionally. Still trying to recover from that. That’d probably be my biggest fuck up. This was an interesting question."
relationships,ffhz1pf,t3_etlz3f,1579959876.0,"I agree with the other commenter - ask him. You won’t know until you do, and frankly you have nothing to lose! It could just be that he’s a bad texter, or it could be that he’s not interested. Honestly though, if texting regularly is something that’s important to you (it is to me) and he ultimately can’t meet those needs then I wouldn’t want to date him anyways."

BlackPeopleTwitter,ffhpqim,t3_etic9j,1579947342.0,"This actually upset me. I am beyond disgusted that the Trumps think any treatment they’ve received is anywhere NEAR the level of harassment, intimidation, cruelty and violence other political voices, such as civil rights activists, have experienced. For the Trumps to even think they are anywhere on the same planet is abhorrent. Rest in Peace Martin Luther King, Medgar Evers, and so many other countless incredibly brave people who had so much more dignity and achieved more than the Trumps ever, ever will."
relationships,ffhoytg,t1_ffholxq,1579946156.0,"Imo no, people can feel comfortable talking/ venting to someone and be drawn to a specific person to vent to, while not being in love with them. This is my opinion though I’d be curious about others"

If you do it when you’re young, you can’t do it when you’re old (and that’s when you’ll presumably want it the most)."

thesopranos,ff3isgr,t1_ff2hoxb,1579541936.0,Well said :) it gives you a glimmer of hope that you could escape from your problems and lose yourself in that mix of culture and vibrancy and the excitement of other people’s lives.

thesopranos,fepqxkb,t3_eqcd9q,1579328292.0,"Furio wasn’t necessarily looking to be with the most beautiful or sexy woman. He was looking for emotional connection, for someone to understand him, and he found that in Carmela. I think what furthered the attraction for both Carmela and Furio toward each other is that they could both only dance around it and only barely dip their toes in. The vast majority of it stayed in their heads - there, romance never goes wrong, fantasies always play out the way you want them to, and your crush is perfect, the embodiment of everything you want in someone. It’s easy to see why Furio got carried away."

If she’s dating you, you have to come first - if you’re uncomfortable with their relationship (and you have a right to be based on their behaviour) she should respect that. And she’s not. Like someone else said, she’s either inconsiderate or untrustworthy. Neither of those qualities are appealing in someone you’re dating."

relationships,fdi9iyl,t3_eld7kr,1578438163.0,"Hey OP it’s totally normal to feel down about ourselves, but you shouldn’t feel that way all the time! You deserve to feel confident in yourself and your body, and that confidence should come from *you*, not from affirmation from your boyfriend. Talking to a counsellor would be awesome, I feel like even googling “how to have confidence in yourself” and reading whatever comes up would help too. Also, do you have any things that make you feel confident, like specific songs you listen to, or a hobby? If so, get more into those! 

Lastly, sometimes we have to consciously change our thinking in order to get to where we want to be. That means stopping the negative thoughts in their tracks, and questioning them, and making yourself realize they’re not true or fair to you. Consciously replace them with positive thoughts. I’m trying to do that too. Good luck :)"
