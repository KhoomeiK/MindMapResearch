However, I find that if I need to read something fairly close up with uncorrected vision, I could form a tiny hole in front of my eye using my fingers in a certain position and look through that somewhat clearly...enough to read small text from several inches away. For some reason, the tiny aperture seemed to work. I can’t imagine it wouldn’t be different with a tiny hole made through some dark leaf held close to the eye...or perhaps via a long dark tube that kept incoming light from scattering too much, and I’m sure someone must have figured it out somewhere along the road."

Well, I can understand how the dog might be able to sense something if the deceased owner (in olden times) was placed in a non-sealed casket/container in the ground (and even then, not fully six feet deep). I mean, as the body decomposes, perhaps some scent of the owner wafts along with the released gases through the soil?

RedLetterMedia,ff4qi85,t1_ff4mx7s,1579570012.0,"That’s an excellent point. I think Shatner came back for *Generations* on the proviso that he allowed his character to be killed. At the time, Shatner was in his early 60s. 

Stewart is currently 79 years old. I can’t think of another series, regardless of genre, where the actor in the title character role was an octogenarian in the premiere season. 

Not to be coarse, but everyone must’ve known going in that they would have to plan for Stewart not being around for a second season due to reasons.I mean, the similarly aged lead actors for *Matlock* and *Murder, She Wrote* already had quite a few seasons done and were syndication-eligible before hitting 80, I think.

Perhaps a ST analogy series might be an option...with single-season seasons being *Data,* *Seven of Nine,* *Crusher*, or *Riker* (like they were going to do with the X-Men: Origins movies)? Perhaps also carrying the storyline from *Picard* into these seasons as needed?

Film is one thing, but it’s my understanding that TV can be pretty brutal on its cast and crew and I can’t imagine that anyone reasonably expects Stewart to keep doing it. Even a small run of five episodes is is a lot of filming, even if Stewart isn’t in a majority of the scenes (which he might not be until the end...kind of like the way Mark Hamill didn’t really figure into the sequel trilogy until the second film even though the first film was all about trying to find his character)."

Masculine nouns tend to end in a consonant; same with words ending in -age, -acle, -al, -eau, -ier, -isme.
