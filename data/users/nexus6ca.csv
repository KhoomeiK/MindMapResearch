chess,fech6ur,t1_feb1uu4,1578973832.0,"The gap between a beginner and a 1400 is pretty large BUT you can close it quickly with study and lots of play. A strong player is generally considered someone around 1900+. The gap between 1400 and 1900 is also large but this gap generally takes longer to close.

In any case, keep playing, read some books and enjoy the game! Improvement will come naturally."

MMA,fd3z0uv,t1_fd2qstf,1578162906.0,"Got to remember that while the flying hammer of doom as after the KO, it was the follow through to the punch. It wasn't like Hendo threw the H-Bomb and watched Bisping fall and decided instead of doing a Mark Hunt walk away KO that he would try to shut Bisping's mouth for good. The flying hammer came right after the punch - maybe less then half of second.

The talk afterwords was just smacktalk that Bisping deserved because of the prefight BS."

A good example is Magnus's game against  Firouzja, after he knocked over the piece Magnus instantly pointed at it.

Edit: Rewatching the video, Krush was the one knocking everything over. Her opponent should have done above and then maybe we would have seen Krush throw the whole board."
