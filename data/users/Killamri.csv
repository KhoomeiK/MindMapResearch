Your reasons were perfectly understandable and I don't blame you at all. It's a hard thing to bring up, but it was worth a shot. In my opinion you just gave her an option she didn't have before.

That said, pregnancy is rough and painful and a lot to go through. She's also in a very emotional state. No doubt going through all that and then not even keeping the child isn't very appealing to her. Mind you, she'd, I assume, still be allowed to see her child.

In the end it's her decision and I'm not entirely surprised she reacted poorly given the circumstances.

If it wasn't for the physical and emotional toll of going through a pregnancy, I'd have been 100% in your favor, but as it is... again, NAH I think since it doesn't sound like you were pressuring her."

There are ""toxic"" behaviors for both genders when you start enforcing stereotypical gender roles.

Men: man up, be strong, you're expendable, etc. Otherwise you're a pussy. Have fun not having friends you little bitch. What? Why aren't you making more money? Your wife is the bread winner? Where is your pride?

Women: Be meek and subservient (far less of an issue today in certain countries to be fair), be pretty/sexy and fit into a size 2 or below everything or no one will ever love you ever. Also when are you having kids?

I don't blame you, but technically speaking this is petty and an asshole move. You ended up cooking anyway, but then made sure he wouldn't like what you made. You knew this was gonna make him mad. 

I also don't blame him for missing your cooking if it's better than his.

BUUUUT I also see how if you didn't do what you did it could breed complacency. He really needs to stop being a baby and feed himself in the end. Share the load and all that.

The non-asshole move IMO would've been take only make yourself a meal and leave NOTHING for him. Then he'd have been forced to feed himself period, and you wouldn't have been taking any shots at him by offering him food you damn well knew he wasn't going to want. Mind you this still wouldn't have made him happy, but I think it would have been less petty.

I don't want her to miss her one and only prom, but she currently doesn't deserve it and that's not a lot of time to earn it back.

Only thing I'd say is depending on how far off prom is, maybe let her earn that one back. You only get one highschool experience. Parties are whatever, they're not important, but resentment is an ugly thing and missing her prom might breed a lot of it and then she might just lash out even worse and create more victims.  


Now I'm not saying cave in. If she continues with bad behavior then she'll have made her own bed, but I'd still say give her a chance. Maybe don't even say anything. Just a short time before prom tell her you've decided to let her go since she's been doing better."
