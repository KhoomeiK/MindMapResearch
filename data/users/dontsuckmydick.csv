AskReddit,ffbc4nm,t1_ffbaxpn,1579759218.0,"Oh Jesus Christ do I seriously have to explain how tax brackets work, too?

Simple version: if the tax rate is 20% up to $100,000 and 30% for $100,001+ the 30% only applies to the percentage of your income over $100,000, not your entire income. If you make $120,000, your taxes would be $26,000, not $36,000.

This is another very common misunderstanding about taxes. Probably about as common as thinking tax write offs are like free money.

Just to reiterate, making less money will NEVER result in you ending up with more money due to tax brackets. It's literally impossible."
AskReddit,ffbaqzm,t1_ffba1n1,1579757750.0,No. Just stop. There is literally no situation in which writing something off on taxes is more beneficial than having the original money that was lost. You get to write stuff off because you no longer have that money. Tax write offs are never a net positive unless you're committing fraud.
