While almost every orthopedist I know is extremely smart, orthopedics has an unearned reputation for being full of morons. The old joke in medicine is that to be an orthopedist, you need to be as strong as an ox and twice as smart.  Another joke is that when rushing to catch an elevator, the internist will use his hand to hold open the door. The general surgeon, not wanting to risk his hand, will use his foot. The orthopedist will use his head. The reason for this reputation is that although you need to be brilliant to secure the position, you rapidly forget most general medicine after a few years, since all you do as an orthopedist is ""carpentry,"" dealing with the physics of joint replacement and such.

It's hard to ascribe behavior to religion when these holy books contain conflicting information. Additionally many theocracies make up parts of the religion that were never part of the original text. Mohammed had a dog, and there are several references to dog ownership in the Quran, yet dog ownership is discouraged in many Muslim states based on some strained reason. Similarly, the burka is not advocated in the Quran, but it's enforced for societal reasons. People do stupid things for stupid reasons, and then often look to some authority (theology, sociology, science, economics) to justify their stupid decision.

However, your original response to my proposition was that an atheist government that does horrible things does so not because of atheism. I agree that if atheism is defined as a lack of belief in god and nothing more, then would be hard to ascribe any decision to be motivated by atheism, just like it one would not ascribe any behavior to the absence of belief in unicorns. By this definition, almost nothing could be ascribed to atheism. However, the communist movement was an anti-theist movement, and many of the atrocities committed were done explicitly because of anti-theism.

I suppose when you described atheist government, I was envisioning a government that embraced science and reason, and that they could still do horrible things in the name of science.

Most Hollywood swordfighting shows hack and slash flighting with 10 pound hunks of metal, and thus developed a style based on that.

If you look at a katana, which still has an unbroken tradition both in manufacture and use, you see a combat sword that is light enough that any strong woman could wield it properly.

A person of average male strength could wield a katana effectively. There are women who are stronger than the average male.

Additionally, speed and precision may outweigh strength in swordfighting. Momentum equals mass x velocity, meaning speed has a considerable impact. With proper armor, swordfighting may be more about being able to seek the gaps in armor.

Additionally, as queen in this fictional world, she would likely be astride a warhorse mowing down unarmored foot soldiers.

Judge Awards Nearly $13 Million to Women Who Say They Were Exploited by Porn Producers

The ruling capped a three-month civil trial that exposed the bait-and-switch tactics and false promises deployed as part of a scheme to induce young women to shoot a pornographic video.

By Michael Levenson
Published Jan. 2, 2020
Updated Jan. 3, 2020, 12:42 a.m. ET

A Superior Court judge in San Diego tentatively awarded nearly $13 million to almost two dozen young women on Thursday, ruling that they had been tricked into performing in pornographic videos that derailed and uprooted their lives and led several to become suicidal.

The ruling capped an unusual 99-day civil trial that exposed the bait-and-switch tactics and false promises deployed as part of a scheme to induce young women, who would not otherwise consider filming pornography, to fly to San Diego and shoot a pornographic video.

The judge, Kevin A. Enright, ordered the defendants to remove the women’s images and videos from the pornographic websites they control or own, and to take steps to remove them from other online sites.

He gave both sides 15 days to object to his decision before it would become final.

Edward Chapin, a lawyer who represented the 22 plaintiffs in the suit, said Thursday that the ruling was an important victory for the young women who had suffered personally and professionally. Each woman would receive an amount ranging from about $300,000 to $550,000.

“They are happy with the outcome because it shows they were believed, that their story was believed,” Mr. Chapin said. “They had been shamed. These guys attacked them, harassed them and intimidated them so it was challenging to get them to testify. So it’s a vindication for them.”

The case named three defendants: Michael J. Pratt, the chief executive of GirlsDoPorn.com; Andre Garcia, an actor; and Matthew Wolfe, a videographer, as well as the business entities they operated.

Daniel Kaplan and Aaron Sadock, two lawyers for the defendants, said Thursday that their clients were weighing their options and would most likely file objections to the court’s tentative decision, and if the decision became final, formally appeal.

Mr. Kaplan and Mr. Sadock said their clients were also focused on defending themselves against criminal charges filed last fall in federal court in San Diego that mirrored the allegations leveled against them in the civil case.

In October, Mr. Pratt, Mr. Wolfe and Mr. Garcia were each charged with three counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion, and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion.

Another associate, Valorie Moser, who the authorities said helped recruit the women, was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion.

Mr. Wolfe, Mr. Garcia and Ms. Moser pleaded not guilty in the criminal case.

The authorities said in October that Mr. Pratt, who is originally from New Zealand, had left the country and was considered a fugitive. During the civil trial in San Diego, only one defendant, Mr. Wolfe, appeared in court, and “provided guarded, and at times inconsistent testimony,” Judge Enright wrote.

“The tentative ruling does not affect the criminal case,” Mr. Kaplan and Mr. Sadock said in a joint statement. “The government’s burden of proof in the criminal case is ‘beyond a reasonable doubt,’ which is much higher standard than in this civil lawsuit where the burden of proof is a mere preponderance of the evidence.”

Judge Enright found that the women had been lured with Craiglist ads that offered to pay them around $5,000 for photos or video shoots. The ads did not indicate that any nudity or pornography would be involved.

“Wanted,” one ad read, “beautiful college type preppy girls,” for video and photo shoots.

The women who responded to the ads said they were directed to innocuous websites, with pictures of clothed women, that asked for their contact information and photographs.

The ads turned out to be from the producers of GirlsDoPorn, who were seeking women to make so-called amateur pornography, which often features fresh-faced actresses paired with seasoned male performers.

Once a newly recruited woman had flown to San Diego, she found herself alone in a hotel room with two men about to shoot a pornographic video, Judge Enright wrote.

At this point, the producers had the women sign documents containing “dense and ambiguous legalese,” which they falsely described as guarantees that their videos would be distributed only on DVD outside of the United States and would never be published online, Judge Enright wrote.

“Defendants rush and pressure the woman to sign the documents quickly without reading them and engage in other deceptive, coercive and threatening behavior to secure their signatures,” Judge Enright wrote, describing the scheme.

The court found that, contrary to the producers’ promises, the women’s videos were published on GirlsDoPorn, a paid subscription website, and many popular free sites such as Pornhub.com.

“In this case, we’re not saying they had a gun to their head, but they were lied to, sold a bill of goods,” said Brian Holm, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. “The crux of it is fraud.”

The defendants lawyers had said the women had signed contracts that stated the videos they appeared in could be “used anywhere, anyhow, for any purpose.”

The distribution of the videos caused the women to experience severe harassment, emotional and psychological trauma, reputational harm, and to lose jobs and academic and professional opportunities, Judge Enright wrote. The videos also derailed and uprooted the women’s lives, he wrote.

“They have become pariahs in their communities,” Judge Enright wrote, adding that several “have become suicidal.”

He found that the women’s injuries were “directly attributable to the defendants’ fraudulent scheme” and awarded the women a total of about $9.5 million in compensatory damages and $3.3 million in punitive damages.

Judge Enright also found evidence that the defendants harassed some of the women who filed the lawsuit.

Shortly after one of the women, identified only as Jane Doe 1, hired a lawyer in an effort to obtain a copy of the documents she had signed and to get her videos removed from the web, the pornographic video she had shot was sent to dozens of students, professors and administrators at her law school, the judge wrote.

The defendants denied sending the video, but Judge Enright found it “more likely than not that they were behind the harassment.”"

The amount of work one contraction does (stroke work) is about 90 grams/meter.

Pressure is pretty close to your systolic blood pressure, about 120 mmHg or 16 kPa.

Force isn't really measured or used in cardiac physiology, since the loading conditions of heart change all the time, and the contractile force is inferred from things like how quickly the pressure can rise (normal is about 1200 mmHg/s).  But if measured at the aortic root, force would be about 450g.  This is a back of the envelope calculation, and I sure someone will point out a more accurate assessment.

>How does oxygen get transferred to every cell in the body, is there a capillary leading to every individual cell?

Not every cell. While capillaries are in almost every tissue bed, when it gets down to the cellular level, the oxygen may diffuse across the tissue, meaning that It might diffuse through a few cells. One way to think of this is that the capillary itself is made of blood vessel cells, so oxygen has to diffuse from blood cell to blood plasma to capillary epithelium to the tissue. Some tissues, like the front of the eye, have no blood supply, and get the oxygen from diffusing in the atmosphere.

>And how exactly does blood get through tiny areas in the body, is there some mechanism for even distribution of pressure? (The blood in my pinky toe is so far from the heart, how does it get back?)

There is a pressure gradient from the aorta all the way to the vena cava. Although the cross sectional area of a capillary is much much smaller than that of the aorta, your circulatory system is massively parallel.  So the cross sectional area of all capillary beds is massively larger than the aorta.  Resistance is much smaller at the capillary bed. The pressure gradient by the time it reaches the capillaries is very small, but enough to keep it moving.

 Flow is regulated by smooth muscles in the arterioles and venules (mostly venules), which can contract to decrease flow. Organs get different pressures depending on what the need, so they don't have even distribution of pressure. The lungs have very low resistance and therefore very low pressure. The kidneys receive a relatively higher pressure. When you exercise, different vessels dilate and constrict to direct higher pressures and flow to your muscles, and less to your gut.

As to how blood returns, there is still a pressure gradient, with capillary pressure slightly higher then venous pressure (on average). For movement against gravity, like from your toe to your heart, your veins have valves that augment one-way flow. Muscle contractions coupled with venular valves help with blood return."

First, the hospital at which he was treated has the full suite of testing options including EEG and cerebral perfusion. Second, if he had been pronounced brain dead, he would not have continued to get treatment at the hospital or at a rehab center.

And yes, it would be as simple as seeing an EEG that demonstrates sleep wake cycles, although there are other tests as well. If his pupils responded to light and could move (often they can move vertically in locked in syndrome) then one would call it sever brain damage. But not brain death.

There are other reasons why someone could have fixed pupils. If they intubated him, or of he thrashing and they needed him to be still, they sometimes administer a medication that blocks all muscular movement, including pupillary response. If someone is profoundly hypothermic, or in profound shock, pupils can be nonreactive.

However, if someone had traumatic brain injury and they had fixed and dilated pupils with no other contributing cause, there is a very high chance of brain death.

The body is kept alive for a day or two while they do their workup. In some cases, the dead patient is discharged, and them readmitted under a different name, like Donor xxxxx, so the patient or insurer won't be paying for the workup.  They will sometimes do bronchoscopy to look at the lungs, echocardiography to looks at the heart, or image scans.

They also coordinate with the recipients to minimize downtime.

They don't sedate the dead body, because s/he can't feel anything.

When they are ready, they go into the OR and cut out the organs.


The other situation is donation after cardiac death. If you're an organ donor and you end up suffering a catastrophic illness or injury, but are not brain dead, your family may be approached about donation after cardiac death.

In this case, the family is planning on withdrawing life support, and there is an expectation that you will die quickly, like within 20 minutes, and that your organs would likely still be viable.

In that case, they coordinate with the OR.  They withdraw life support, and you are pronounced dead. They rush your body to the OR, where you are confirmed dead and they star harvesting, no earlier than 2 minutes, and no later than 5 minutes from the original pronouncement. In this scenario, the organs are more likely to get injured, because they have a longer time without good blood flow.

In both cases, you are dead when they harvest. You won't feel anything, and they won't sedate you."

In short, if someone truly has brain death, they will never recover. They are dead. I suspect that this was a misunderstanding, where the docs talked about brain death and the family misunderstood. Although as mentioned elsewhere in this thread, some idiot docs will incorrectly pronounce someone as brain dead without actually testing the criteria.

Some patient got pronounced brain dead at a community emergency department and got transferred to a large hospital for organ donation. The physician didn't do any testing, just said, ""brain dead."" Upon arrival, the team learned the patient was breathing. Not brain dead. No organ donation. Patient was severely and permanently brain damaged, and would likely never wake up or meaningfully interact, but not brain dead. Way more stressful for the family, who now has to decide whether to continue care or withdraw.

Locked in syndrome can be hard to diagnose, but brain death has specific criteria that are often not met with locked in syndrome. I can see a misdiagnosis of coma or persistent vegetative state, but I'm having trouble grasping how doctors could have pronounced you brain dead. Your pupils would still react to light. An EEG would show sleep-wake patterns. Cerebral perfusion studies and carotid Doppler would show you still had blood-flow to the brain.

Additional, if you were pronounced brain dead, you would be legally dead, and they would either harvest organs or withdraw support. No hospital or nursing home would care for a dead patient.

So I'm wondering if you are conflating brain death with PVS or some other diagnosis.

Can you elaborate on how the doctors misdiagnosed brain death?

EDIT:
Sorry I asked this, as I guess it doesn't really matter and this question just generated unnecessary controversy. OP was cared for at MGH. That hospital does formal testing for brain death, which means this was likely a miscommunication issue. Either a trainee or physician said something stupid off the cuff, or the family misunderstood severe brain damage for brain death. A conversation might go something like this:

""so, doc, is he brain dead?""

""Practically speaking, there isn't much difference. He's so profoundly damaged, he will likely never wake up and have any meaningful interaction.""

--you can imagine in a stressful situation, it's hard to pick up on that nuance, and it could have been explained better.

Either way, this doesn't detract from the fact that your recovery is impressive. Way to go, OP, and keep working with rehab!"

It might be harmful to receive the experimental treatment compared to placebo.

The real reason to participate in a study is for the common good.  As a society, we have benefitted from therapies that someone else studied decades ago. If I participate in a study, the correct motivation should be that you want to help future patients.  Even phase 3 trials are often found to be negative or harmful compared to placebo. If we knew the drug worked, we wouldn't study it, we would just administer it.

Of course it's all bullshit.  Desperate cancer patients sign up for phase 2 trials which have no reasonable expectation of benefit.  Even when we explain the informed consent, the majority of people who sign up incorrectly think the study might benefit them. The researchers have a secondary gain to enroll subjects so they don't push too hard to ensure that people sign up for the right reasons.

news,fcf76lu,t1_fcexxdr,1577627227.0,"Dawkins is sometimes referred to as an aggressive atheist, or dick atheist.  He actively campaigns.  In general, most people unreceptive to active proselytizers for any belief.

I think it's in part due to his referring to theists as deluded, and implying that people who believe in God/gods are stupid. Whether he means to or not, he comes off as patronising and aggressive.

He also feels the need to correct people from this delusion, rather than let them persist. I understand the argument that allowing the delusion to persist carries some harm, but many people aren't receptive to hearing it. This results in accomplishing nothing other than antagonizing the theist, who is unconvinced by a rational argument against God and now thinks the atheist is a dick.

We all carry irrational beliefs. No one likes being called stupid. There are so many brilliant doctors, scientists, and engineers who believe in God. The smartest person I know is a devout Mormon and writes theological papers in his spare time. I have a hard time reconciling his brilliance with his belief in Mormonism, which has so much evidence for being wholly fabricated by a single charismatic cult leader.

Rather than trying to convince someone that they spent their entire lives incorrectly believing in something that is stupid, it would be more effective to live a just life as an atheist, and be open to discussing it if someone appears receptive.

I have a friend who is very religious and was taught that atheists are less moral people (a common sentiment among theists). He confided that it was eye-opening to him when he started hanging out with our group, which was almost entirely atheistic, that atheists could be normal and moral people.
