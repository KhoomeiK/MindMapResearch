relationship_advice,ff5lf8e,t3_erogtb,1579598607.0,"I'm sorry but he isnt mature enough to be in a relationship with a female if he cant deal with something females naturally do.

I'm the same age as you, and my boyfriend is the same age as yours, and me and my boyfriend will just casually joke about my period.

I feel like you should be able to do the same, or at least talk about it casually. Periods aren't the nicest things, but he shouldnt be treating it like this disgusting thing if he ever hopes to have a good relationship with a woman. It's something that happens every month, so he needs to get used to it. We cant just magic it away (as much as we might want to) so he shouldn't be hating that you have it.

Good luck my friend :))"

Me and him do have a balance of acting like annoying mates and actually being nice to each other, and I really enjoy that about my relationship, but I understand where you are coming from if that's not what you would want in a relationship. 

Me and him are in our late teens so maybe that's why i like how the relationship is, cos we are still decently immature (both act mentally 12 when we want to lol)"

Parenting,fc65rtb,t3_egaix2,1577472912.0,"There is a huge difference between making your kids aware of your problem to reassure them they aren't the reason, and telling them all your problems and having them be your place to vent to.

You sound like you are just being responsible and telling them that yes you do have stuff doing on, and that's why you have your bad days, but they are not to feel responsible for them. You are doing the best thing you could do tbh.

I'd even say you could give a little less detailed explanation to the younger 2 if they are starting to notice your behaviour some days. You dont have to give them as much detail as you give the older 2, but if they do notice then just give them a simple explanation to also provide some reassurance.

Obviously you know your kids better than anyone else so you do what's best but in my opinion you are dealing with it regarding your 2 oldest the best way you could be."
Parenting,fc63odb,t3_egch01,1577471547.0,"I'm in a bit of a different situation so I cant give perfect advice but I feel like i can give a different view than maybe some parents on her can. I (16F) recently started counselling. It was my choice to start but one thing that made me almost completely put off it was the fear of having to face those emotions. However, after my first session, I couldn't wait to go back and have another one.

Thinking as a teenager, I'd say do what others on here are suggesting and say if she goes to one session and she chooses she doesn't like it then she can stop going. To be completely honest if you've got the right person and she is dealing with something regular counselling/ therapy can help with, then chances are she will be quite willing to continue after the first session.

Good luck and all the best. I really hope your daughter gets out of this spot she seems to be in now and well done for trying to take action now rather than leaving it until she is older and in more need of help."
