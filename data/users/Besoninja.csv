I assume you've been applying for positions with the federal government? If not that's definitely a good foot in the door to an IT career. From a quick google it looks like USAJobs.gov is the place to look"

Oof. Not sure techtonics GAF about racism, or human troubles xD 
Turns out geologists think we split about 3 million years ago, MB.

todayilearned,fdgdmon,t3_el5fyo,1578391765.0,Please correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure Australia sits on the Indo-Australian Plate... in which Australia shares a plate with India...
science,fdg5sw5,t1_fdfijz5,1578381177.0,"All good. This rector type I mentioned uses Uranium as fuel. It can use depleted uranium, so also solution to our ever increasing DU deposits"
science,fdg1xc4,t1_fdg0w4k,1578377008.0,"Ahaa, yeah covering the land in solar is one of the proposed solutions in this book. I believe the author suggests 2x1000km^2 solar grids (in the two biggest deserts (Australia and middle east)) will cover all of human energy needs through peak population later this century. But then u need to transport that energy around the globe, no small feat but by no means impossible. This book is like 10 years old so solar is far better these days...
If we had more people focusing on this I think the market (and battery tech/ ease of use) would increase."
science,fdfzcwz,t1_fdfbkdh,1578374559.0,"Not really, we have had the technological ability to live completely without fossil fuels for some time now. It's just not what is in the people's interest I guess... This book was a big eye opener for me, completely free to download: https://www.withouthotair.com/"

Honestly though, I hope he just gets a lil slap on the wrist. We desperately need blokes like this to keep going."

planesgonewild,fd0psck,t1_fcyu6r4,1578122127.0,Fun fact re. the landing gear - the GAU-8 (main cannon) is slightly off to left side to accommodate the front landing gear. Bc of this the barrel fires when it is on the right most side of its rotation (and in line with the centre of the aircraft)

LifeAfterSchool,fcmx86k,t3_ehqmep,1577796292.0,"Sounds like you have an opportunity that not many people get, esp at your age. Perhaps have a chat to some of your co-workers or mention some your concerns to your boss, be honest (but not defeatist). They should be willing to help you out.
Just remember it won't last forever. 
Sounds like an awesome role you are in with a big future if u want it ðŸ™‚"

LifeAfterSchool,fc5aw1g,t3_egaj30,1577451527.0,"As the previous commenter suggested - could just be a location thing. There are some great social advantages you have by not having a family to take care of; career mobility, location mobility, spare money and time, insurance costs, etc. But i def feel you, its hard to make (and esp maintain) friendships as an adult, which can be draining and isolating. The vlog brothers did a couple of good videos on this topic: https://youtu.be/fJIWMTWojy8, https://youtu.be/vwqOvyfAZHc.
Stay strong, you are certainly not alone."

Also, you realise the ABC is owned and run by the government, right?"
