pathofexile,ff4uvek,t3_ernuzq,1579573001.0,"Yeah, this subreddit. Seriously, ""PSA: Be careful, I just got scammed!"" posts are incredibly popular here, and anyone who dares suggest that they're excessive or repetitive gets downvoted into the core of the earth."

For rum and other straight spirits, though, the calories are going to be the calories of the alcohol and very little else. That's 7 calories per gram of alcohol, or about 5.6 calories per  millilitre. You can do the maths with the size of your shot glass and the alcohol by volume of your rum. :-)"
loseit,ff28pvn,t3_er2m59,1579497085.0,"There's a rule of thumb that you shouldn't aim for losing more than 1% bodyweight per week. So at 160lb, aiming to lose as much as 2lb per week (being a 1000 kcal deficit per day) is too aggressive. Try bumping your 1200 kcal up to 1450 and see how you go."
loseit,ff27x4i,t3_er8ajt,1579496392.0,"Personally, if you want to lose weight without counting calories because you think it takes too much self control, I'd recommend attacking it from the angle of eating better rather than ""starving for long periods of time"". If your meals are piled high with lean protein, whole grains, vegetables and fruit, and you drink water, you're naturally going to consume less calories than if you were eating junk food and drinking soda. Even if you do ""keep on eating until you are full""."
