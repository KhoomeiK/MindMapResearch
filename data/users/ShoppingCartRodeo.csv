Its just happening more. Growing up, i didn't want to come out as bi because a lot of girls i knew would be bi for a week then change their minds because it got someone's attention. I also didn't talk about my mental issues as much because i didn't want to be seen as ""attention seeking"" like a few others i knew. My little sister in law says shes Pan because her friends at school are Pan. It makes me so angry. If she turns out to be Pan when shes an adult, cool but claiming something like that because of your peers is fucked up for the kids who are actually a specific orientation."

My sister is the type of selfish, self centered person who has to show off how much better shes living her life without her exes every time she burns a bridge, and constantly talks mad shit about her baby daddy [niece's dad. She never brings home good men, just fuck boys she thinks she can fix. Lives through cliched, half motivational, obvious truth facebook quotes mostly about ""rise and grind"" and highlighting the first half of this description of her ability to burn bridges in a bragging manner. In this one woman, dead horse parade, she has manipulated almost everyone around her into thinking shes the good guy, everyone makes her out to be the villian [including her own daughter]. Simultaneously emotionally and mentally abused the living fuck out of my niece so bad, the poor girl barely knows what parental love is. What little she knows is what my parents, myself and a handful of genuine people in her life have tried our best to show her. My niece attempted suicide twice, ran away from her mother multiple times until my sister finally gave up but still wants to sink her greedy claws into that child. Anything to make the dad look like the devil. Yes he did make mistakes, so did she, but only my sister, in her mind, is allowed to make a come back.
My sister: 40 this year
My niece: 15
My sisters been like this for most of her own life.

TL;DR: If anyone could be crowned selfish cunt, my sister would have her name in pink diamonds set in it, then wear it even while she sleeps."
