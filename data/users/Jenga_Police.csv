worldnews,ffv2iyz,t1_ffunnzo,1580254186.0,"Idk I think the instantaneous spread of news due to the Internet is the major factor. Not only does everyone know about it, but everyone can talk about it at once. The massive population size invites jokes and gallows humor because people naturally seek attention.

If it was simply teens like you're saying, then this effect would have been constant and happening for all of history."
worldnews,ffuy9mm,t1_ffuy2ck,1580251642.0,"He hasn't had a worse effect, but he's an objectively worse person and IMO a worse person to have in the white house."
nextfuckinglevel,ffuxinz,t1_ffure55,1580251229.0,To an extent. size and breed also go hand in hand. Part of a dog's range has to do with the length of its legs and its stride.

justneckbeardthings,ffsvrit,t1_ffsu6lg,1580194424.0,"It was published without his name, but maybe he bragged about it? If it was published somebody had to know who wrote it."
apexlegends,ffrci9t,t1_ffraq6d,1580155219.0,"Just the universe in general is capable of staving off death. I was referring to regeneration which is canon from Titanfall; I don't want him to be a simulacrum cuz I like his character design.

Forge was sponsored by Hammond Robotics."
justneckbeardthings,ffr7kcc,t1_ffqt97a,1580152174.0,"This is why I vehemently crusade against the /s. People wanna complain and tell me ""wah, you can't always tell sarcasm through text"", and I direct them to *[A Modest Proposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal)*, an 18th century satirical essay about eating children to combat poverty, and suggest that some of the best satire is not only in text form, but misunderstood by some. I feel like even the best satire isn't meant to be understood by everyone, that's part of what makes it funny."

Zach Woods is still great whether he's Gabe, Jared, or customer service rep on a space cruise.

I feel like they keep throwing out little worldbuilding lines, like the other ships, the pacific ocean being toxic, ~~Buy n Large~~ the Judd Corp, etc, but it's just failing very hard to make me care about anything besides goofy antics aboard the ship.

Quote of the episode for me:  I am the Alpha, and the Beta!"
gifs,ffpum53,t1_ffptgmk,1580106319.0,"Man I don't care about Kobe Bryant or basketball, but seeing someone so alive and healthy's life swept out from under their feet in an instant leaves me shellshocked. Maybe it's because we see celebrity faces our whole lives, but I can't stop picturing him with cold lifeless eyes."

blackmagicfuckery,ffk12aw,t1_ffk0prc,1580012557.0,"It's a very dry, dark comedy. I think it's pretty good, though a little predictable on some major plot points it's still enjoyable."
blackmagicfuckery,ffk0eue,t1_ffk099i,1580011999.0,"If you've got Hulu, I'd check it out. It's called The Art of Self Defense. Very dry dark comedy, but well worth it IMO."
