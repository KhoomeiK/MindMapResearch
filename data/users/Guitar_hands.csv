Listen if you're one of those people that says that Lincoln would still be a republican and Andrew Jackson would still be a Democrat, you're beyond reason. If you still don't know how the parties switched and have bought into that, ""the parties haven't ever changed"" just ask yourself out of Republicans or Democrats, who is the most likely to fly the Confederate flag? The leaders of the KKK and other such groups, which parties ideals do they support in this day and age? The old Dixiecrats and Democrats who changed parties in the 50s and 60s, why did they do that if the parties never changed?"

worldnews,ff43t0r,t1_ff3z64x,1579554921.0,"I think you're confused about what socialism is. It's not leaching off of the govt. It's ideally not needing to leach off of anything. It's basic tenants are having your basic needs met through redistributing wealth from the top to the bottom to fill the holes created by unchecked capitalism. No one, no one, not Bernie not most of his followers are looking to banish capitalism in whole. Just tweak and rework it in parts so that it can adequately provide for everyone and bring back the American dream. Which as of now is unattainable for most and getting farther by the year. It's less the government giving you things and more stopping the CEO of your company from buying a second 10 million dollar yacht and instead allowing 400 people to buy 25 thousand dollar cars or giving 10 thousand people a thousand dollar pay raise a year etc.. One thousand people a 10 thousand dollar pay raise. That's literally changing the lives of the actual people doing the work and all it costs is reinvesting in workers and the population instead of a select few who will hoard the wealth, hold it offshore so it isn't taxed and then passed down to their children who will receive it again without being taxed. That money will never benefit the population, except for maybe one foreign company when they buy their yacht. But spread it out to thousands of people who will use it for things like cars, housing, groceries, entertainment, etc and it will benefit the economy by being spread out to a bunch of companies, both big and small where the money is spend and again when it is taxed and comes back to them in the form of roads and schools and public parks and programs that allow for the cycle to repeat. Right now what to you think would do the most good? Allowing one guy to buy a yacht or giving 20 thousand people 1000 extra dollars. Or 400 people to buy a car or put a down payment on a house? Yes, the yacht is just an example. Replace it with artwork or a second or third beach house or stock buybacks. When 200 people have the same wealth as the bottom 2/3rds or so, something needs to change. When more money is spent on bonuses for CEOs while they lay off employees, something needs to change. When one person's wealth can rival countries and yet their workers aren't able to see any rewards for their work, something needs to change. When saving is not possible anymore even while working full time, something needs to change. When lack of healthcare can destroy lives and bankrupt people, even those who do have ""insurance"" something needs to change. When teachers need to work another job and are forced to buy their own classroom supplies, something needs to change. When stock buybacks are the norm instead of investing in your employees or reinvesting in the business, something needs to change. When even renting is unaffordable on a single persons wages in a lot of parts of the country, something needs to change. When food banks and churches and shelters are the only safety net, and not a very good or reliable one at that in a lot of cases, something needs to change. When you can't take any time off for any reason and are expected to work sick or are pregnant or just need a day off but can't take one because that will destroy your financial security, something needs to change. When people see no rewards for their work except more work and less pay, while there are people with billions of dollars, who can avoid paying taxes on a lot of it, while the companies they work for are more interested in shareholders profit than workers profits, something needs to change. Socialism isn't s bad thing and no one is calling for strict socialism. Just making our current system more fair and equatable for the masses who are currently getting shafted."

But, they did not believe in centralized power so there was no group who decidied what to do and how to proceed. They had no plan or agenda that focused the energy of the movement in a certain direction. They seemed aimless and unfortunately naive. They gave equal voice to every idea so therefore their mission and goals were ridiculously convoluted. They captured the moment but unlike the teaparty they were not disciplined and did not understand that to make the changes that they wanted to make they had to play the game the same as everyone else. At least as first. They could have focused on getting people elected and forcing change but instead the sentiment seemed to be, we know we're right, do what we say.
