The thing about watching old tv is you have to put yourself back in when it was new and accept it for what it is. TV has evolved and so has society, there’s going to be things that age badly but there’re still good things to take away. You can imagine better special effects, grimace though the sexism and racism of the 60s, and enjoy some of the good stories they’re telling. Despite the bad, Star Trek has always pushed boundaries.

I agree, when I saw the DIS Enterprise it’s just head canon for me that it looks like that in TOS, if only they could have done so in the 60s. It’s not hard and I don’t get why some fans get so obsessed about that stuff. You still have the TOS, a shiny new version of the Enterprise in a 2020 show doesn’t erase the original."
