California is a huge state with many diverse ecosystems so I have a very difficult time believing that it was primarily a desert until just a hundred or so years ago.

plantclinic,ffmejxx,t1_ffmbakx,1580053405.0,"I don't even water my calatheas 3 times a week in the summer. In the winter that is likely far too much.

Are you using tap water? Calatheas are very sensitive to chlorine and other dissolved substances, so they really need distilled water. Maybe filtered if you have a very good water filter.

Then, humidity. If you're in Chicago and running a heater I guarantee you've got very low humidity right now. A pebble tray can help with humidity, but if you've only got the one plant and it's winter you aren't going to be getting a ton of evaporation anyway.

I really do recommend a humidifier if you want long-term success. You can get pretty good-sized humidifiers for under $40, and smaller ones for even  less than that. Worse comes to worse, you can put a very big clear bag or clear plastic over it to hold in humidity.

A couple other things. If this plant dies, don't feel bad. Calatheas are extremely tricky to care for and are unpredictable. Sometimes even if you follow the ""rules"" for calathea to a T they still don't be happy.

Chicago has some amazing plant stores, so I really recommend you go check them out to learn more about plants and get help picking out future plants while you're learning. The Sill is super expensive and their selection of plants is no more exotic than you local plant stores or even hardware stores like Home Depot/Lowe's, which tend to have great offerings in cities.

Most of our fires get started by stupid people flicking cigarette butts or building illegal campfires. But climate is absolutely what makes them so bad. Rain isn't following normal patterns any more.

You're assuming large rivers with lots of water, but that simply isn't the norm in the case of most dams. A massive tidal wave of water isn't going to come rushing out from behind the dam. If a dam is at all sizable it will be removed slowly, and there will likely be dewatering to prevent a rush of water."

Climate change is hitting these systems far faster and far harder than others because of dams. There is no ""later"" for this. If we wait until later, our rivers will be irreparably damaged. There won't be much of a point getting rid of dams.

Diverse ecosystems are more resilient to disturbances and will be more capable of weathering the tide and bouncing back. Reopening and reconnecting habitats and restoring natural flow regimes is necessary for those diverse ecosystems.

We are very much at a breaking point here. In the Pacific Northwest they are already getting summertime temperatures that create a thermal barrier for fish. Salmon could very easily go extinct in just a couple decades because of the joint problems posed by dams and climate change. Can you imagine- the Pacific Northwest without salmon?

And my point is that the last thing we should be doing is coming up with reasons to keep dams. Regardless of what this paper says, the vast majority of dams are not capable of generating any significant amount of power. The dams are bad enough by themselves, but turbines add extra danger for aquatic organisms. Hydro facilities are fish killers.

PETA,ff7tpk2,t1_fel67zl,1579658126.0,"I came across this thread by looking up Asian carp, so it's been a while, but I'd like to share a little perspective as a biologist.

The idea of relocating animals to their ""native"" range sounds nice, but for many reasons it is not a solution at all. Unless you're dealing with a small, isolated environment like an island, it's impossible to catch and remove every individual of an invasive species. So you still have individuals remaining, breeding, and growing the problem again.

When invasive species have been in their invasive range for a good amount of time, they begin to change and adapt to the new environment. Asian carp, for example, are bigger, faster to mature, and reproduce more in their invasive range. You could potentially be harming the populations that have always been within the native range if you reintroduced individuals from the invasive range.

Last, habitat can only support so many individuals. Many animals have minimum territory sizes with little or no overlap or preexisting social structures, on top of the primary resources needed to sustain them. By bringing a huge amount of animals from another place, you are disrupting all of those processes.

Preventing invasives in the first place is the best method, then preventing reproduction (if you can), but sometimes humane culling is the only option."
DebateAVegan,ff7swvp,t1_ff3k080,1579657572.0,"This is factually incorrect. Biological invasions do not work like that in any way, shape, or form.

 In the case of Asian carp, the problem is continuing to worsen because carp in North America are constantly becoming better invades. They are maturing faster, spawning for a longer time during the year, and spawning more than their counterparts in their native range.

They are decimating the native food chain, and it's only becoming worse.

It's nice to have a moral standpoint, but at some point someone has to take a realistic rather than idealistic view. Either you care about native species and biodiversity, or you don't. 

And before it comes up, the argument that humans are bad, humans put them there, what have you, is a BS argument. The people trying to find a solution are not the people that caused the problem."

plantclinic,fep2gyc,t3_eq3xjh,1579310653.0,"Leaves with a lot of white are beautiful, but they don't have enough chlorophyll to support themselves. It isn't unusual for leaves with a lot of white to turn brown, and as long as the overall plant is okay I wouldn't worry.

If you do plan to move it into more light don't do it suddenly, otherwise the leaves may burn."
HealthyFood,feo86t0,t1_feo2xkf,1579296390.0,"Thank you! I didn't follow any particular recipe, but I'll try to write up what I did.

Dice:
- 1 onion (I used a sweet onion)
- 1 red bell pepper
- 5 celery stalks
- 5 cloves of garlic

Chop:
- 1 large sweet potato (I only had one but probably would add more if you have more)

Spices:
- Chili powder
- Cumin
- Paprika
- Cayenne
- Coriander

Other:
- Large can crushed tomatoes
- Can diced tomatoes
- Can kidney beans
- Can black beans
- Cilantro and lime for garnish

Heat olive oil in pot over medium heat and add onion, bell pepper, and celery when pot is hot. Cook until the veggies have sweat out and the onions are fragrant and starting to brown. Then add garlic and cook 1-2 minutes more. Salt and pepper.

Add spices. I don't measure, but I add in an approximate ratio of 1.5:1.5:1:.25:.25. Cook another minute or two and add tomatoes and beans. Add ~ 2 cups of liquid. I didn't have veggie broth but recommend it over water. Salt and pepper again. Then cook until the chili has thickened, and cook as long as you'd like. The longer you cook the better it'll be.

Before serving add lime and cilantro as desired. If needed finish with a bit more salt and pepper."

Then you have days like this coming Saturday, where it's going to be very dry, start low 40s (4C) and plummet down to 5 (-15C) and probably feel colder because of the wind."
houseplants,fejw4gq,t1_fejtots,1579187212.0,It doesn't matter much if your taxes are higher if you're paying less overall. Our healthcare costs are much higher than the increase in taxes would be with state-funded healthcare. Quality of care is also only better if you 1. have very good healthcare and 2. have healthcare to begin with. It doesn't mean much to have the possibility of healthcare if you can't afford to go to the doctor in the first place.

I've bought plants on three separate trips to visit my parents. The first time on a plane I just got one and stuck in my backpack. The second trip by plane I had an entire carry-on bag with four plants lovingly wrapped up and tucked away.

My craziest plant lady moment was when I road tripped it to visit them and brought 5 little plants out with my because I worried they wouldn't make it otherwise."

It wasn't always that way- I worked low-wage jobs in my field three years before starting my PhD and my dad was so constantly on my back about not making money that I almost went to law school (not that it would've been any better, he just had a better perception of if).
