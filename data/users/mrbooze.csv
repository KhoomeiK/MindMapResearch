Warren says Sanders told her he did not believe a woman could win. Some other parties concur with that.

Sanders says he never told her that. Warren says he did. Two people corroborate what Warren told them he said immediately after the meeting and two other people ""familiar with the meeting"" also corroborate it.  (Thus this is not something Warren just made up now, she made claims about what Sanders said back when the meeting happened.)

I don't really see any wiggle room here. He either said he didn't think a woman could win the upcoming election, or he didn't.   That he meant this ""in the current political climate"" is clearly implied, but it doesn't change the fact that he said it, if he did, which he denies."
