The US leads the world in raw medical innovation because the US by far has the largest population of any developed nation. How are you conservatives unable to make this connection? 
Even if that were the case why do you want us propping up the rest of the world at our own expense when it comes to medical innovation?

 [If you look at citable medical research documents](https://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php?area=2700)  by country and divide based on population you'll find that the US performs just as well as other developed countries with universal healthcare when it comes to medical research. The US is better than some, such as France, but worse than others, such as the UK. When you take population into account the UK is actually one of the leading countries in medical research, because per capita they produce more medical innovations than almost any other country, including the US. There are also plenty of innovative non-American pharmaceutical companies, such as Bayer (German) and AstraZeneca (British-Swedish). Universal healthcare also doesn't mean that the government has to be in complete control of healthcare. The Netherlands has universal healthcare and literally every single hospital in the Netherlands is privately operated. Even in the US the government runs some hospitals."
