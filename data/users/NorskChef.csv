Christianity,feu4ets,t1_fetlz3t,1579383027.0,"Paul literally traveled between Spain, all across the Mediterranean to Turkey and down to Jerusalem in Israel. Given the size of the Christian church, it is inconceivable that he didn't meet some of the 500 especially since he was aware, as he wrote, that some of them had already died. Clearly he knew who many of them were.  We have written first person accounts from Matthew, John and Peter. We can't possibly expect written records from most of the 500.  Luke also mentions that he received eyewitness testimony. Many of them were illiterate and as a whole we only have a small number of writings from any human being at all in that time frame which survives to the present day.

And besides the gospels, as I quoted elsewhere, we have the statement of Peter in 2nd Peter. He expressly identifies himself as the author in the first verse and goes on to say the following.

16For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but **were eyewitnesses of his majesty**.17For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.18**And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount**"

There were also 500 witnesses of the risen Jesus which Paul makes note of in Corinthians.

""For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: After that, he was seen of above five hundred brothers at once; of whom the greater part remain to this present, but some are fallen asleep.
