grandorder,fen6w9d,t1_femrceg,1579278291.0,Yeh I hope so too. And I think Apple is too “locked” to download apps from the internet... but I’ll find something and if all else fails I’ll just use an android emulator again. Thanks for the help tho! I really appreciate it :)

I’m from Europe, The Netherlands and use an iPhone. Am I not able to play the game here? Or am I supposed to download it from the Japanese appstore? (i have an account for that but since i dont speak japanese i dont think I’ll manage playing the game...) 
Anyone got any tips? Thanks!"

AskReddit,fdse9y1,t3_emqd57,1578700702.0,"If it counts: Steam
For some games I obviously can’t use it, so I do use other game stores sometimes, but if a game is on Steam and the price isn’t too much different, I’m buying it there. 
(Must admit I bought 2 games, that are on steam too, on another store recently but that saved me about €18,- which I couldn’t waste). 
I prefer to have all my games in one place, like with my books: all in one place. 
It makes it more satisfying (and easier) to look at my collection and I prefer Steam above all else because I am familiar with it, got my friends there and I like how it works with achievements and stuff."

Only got into gaming when I was about 16, noticed I missed out on a lot. I indeed did play the girly games when I was young. I did like some but most were so repetitive. I loved horses so I played many horse games but most sucked and got boring or I finished them quickly.
