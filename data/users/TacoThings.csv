AskReddit,ffelohr,t1_ffekn67,1579853368.0,"I really wouldn’t know what to do in that situation, your parents, with all the respect, acted like monsters. I can’t imagine the pain of losing someone so close to me, or even worse, lost a son and that my sister/brother prefer to stay in a stupid vacation, even beg that they comeback and that they would refund the money on the middle of their child funeral. Just horrible, I’m so sorry."

I’m just searching for like, something epic but cliche, I know it’s dumb but I don’t really know where else to ask or how jaja. Anyway, thank you!"
