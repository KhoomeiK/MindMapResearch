There's a reason the military doesn't do full auto on the M16 platform either, and instead designed actual machine guns for suppressive fire. There's essentially no good reason for any standard rifle or carbine to have full auto.  

Even military units that operate in cop-like  terrain where genuine machine guns aren't really operable (i.e. urban houses, airplanes - think anti-terrorism), but still actually have a genuine need for suppressive fire, use SMGs.

There are more neutral and less personally aggressive ways to say you think their standards are unreasonable, impractical, mistaken...or plain out wrong!

The equivalent of cash on your computer is pretty juicy as a target, and leaving security up to individuals will result in a lot of tears. 

Nano payments are also possible right this second in pretty much any national currency you like - this isn't unique to crypto, fractional currency payments already exist. There are multi-billion dollar trolls taxing that particular bridge - payment processors - that practically prevent this behavior by fees, but it's not a limitation of our de facto digitalized national currencies. 

That said, it *is* true that the pseudonymity, easy spendability, and no-fee advantages of cash transactions currently can't be combined with the many advantages of digital currencies, like arbitrary fractional payments, use over the internet, etc., *except* in cryptocurrencies. 

So I definitely agree that this stuff is super cool, and it holds promise for possible reform of systems that have become corrupted in many ways - like the internet. 

It could also end up just as dystopic as the world we have already built - megacorps are already trying to co-opt cryptocurrencies, and I have no doubt they will continue to do so.

TrueReddit,fec0jqy,t1_febvqvx,1578964862.0,"I didn't say that the poor weren't disproportionately minority, and I was commenting about a societal trend that transcends Trump's short stint as president. I agree the man is racist, but I wasn't talking about him.

Claiming that ""class as the largest problem"" is some innovation of the American Democratic party is also extremely shortsighted - I am not a Marxist, myself, but this particular drum is the one they've been banging internationally for more than a century.  It's a much bigger tent than that, and does not have its origin in modern American politics, or historical American racial problems, at all. 

This is also not a competition. I agree that minorities suffer more, all things being equal - and they suffer most consistently from being poor, due to systemic disenfranchisement. Yes, addressing prejudice in our people and our systems is a necessary part of relieving poverty, and it is morally important even if it wouldn't relieve poverty.

But I am quite sure that if by some fantasy you could only address one of the two - prejudice or poverty - that most disenfranchised people would prefer to wipe their tears with money than be the ennobled poor. Money, for better or worse, is the *primary* form of empowerment in our society. No black millionaire would trade their money for white skin, or claim that their lives were worse than hard luck white coal miners wheezing on their deathbeds in Appalachia. 

And you know what? Luckily, it's not a competition. Shitting on impoverished whites does nothing to empower impoverished people of color, or people of color in general. Yes, being poor and black is a worse fate than being poor and white, but it's not like being poor and white is a good time. 

So why do we make that comparison at all? My personal belief is that it is in the interest of the haves to spark conflict between the have-nots, so that they don't know how bad the haves are screwing them, and/or do not rise up against the system that enslaves them as a permanent underclass - black, many whites, gays, trans, lesbian - all of them  poor, poor, poor, and despised for it, despite it being the product of an exploitative system. 

I do not dismiss the problems unique to different groups. Let us build a more just society, and address all of them. We do not have to choose one at the expense of the other. I want to see all colors, genders, sexual identities, impoverished peoples, or otherwise oppressed groups to rise up in solidarity together against the system that exploits them. 

And the greatest possible problem to solve, if we could solve only one, and the one universal cross that nearly all oppressed groups share, is poverty. It's not a coincidence that what connects a gay white trans girl with a black lesbian, and all other groups, is that they are much more likely to be poor as shit.

Follow the money in society, and there you find the rot. Hell, you inadvertently point it out yourself. What is the primary privilege of the white? *They're, on average, much less poor than other people groups.*"

And while I certainly agree that minorities are often systemically mistreated and oppressed because they are minorities, I have, for a long time, believed that class is more central to our society's problem than race, gender, or sexual identity.

We don't know that's true. Bees may well have learned to love colorful flowers because those were the ones with good nectar. Lots of plants also have colourful flowering or fruiting bodies that aren't pollinated by bees, which makes the claim even more dubious - if it's bee interest that makes flowers colorful, why are some colorful without any bee interest? Or which gain no advantage even when bees are interested? Or which flower in places where there are no bees?

Always be very careful with evo bio explanations that make historical claims like this - they often assert causation for correlations like this one, when we don't actually know what way causation is flowing, or if there is any causative effect at all. It is certainly a possiblity that bee interest drove evolution of color in some flowers, but we need more proof for this than the fact that bees like colorful flowers."

I understand about the bluntness; it's frankly my preferred mode, particularly with people I am close to. It's not a universally shared trait, though, and I try not to enshrine my own traits as somehow more correct than those of others. It's an easy temptation to believe that I am blunt because it is a virtue, rather than the more likely outcome, which is that I am tempted to think being blunt is virtuous because it just so happens that I am blunt. One of these is me describing my own traits as virtuous; the other is recognizing that we all tend to believe that we are virtuous, and to latch on to our traits as proof of that.

> That we all fear death paradoxically seems to be evidence that consciousness *does* persist. 

I was very excited to hear you say this - you are the only person I've ever heard say anything like this, other than me - and it can be very difficult to explain to others exactly what the point is. 

I am not sure whether it is strong evidence that consciousness persists (or how strong it is as evidence, if it is evidence), but I definitely think that the ubiquitous treatment of death as unnatural or abnormal or grievous is interesting, and does seem to require explanation. 

After all, it seems reasonable for creatures to have survival instincts, and to fear death. Creatures that do not have these will presumably go extinct, eventually. But what evolutionary requirement is there for grief? Why do all human beings see death as unnatural? Why do we mourn the dead? Death is a consistent feature of the natural world. Why is it universal to human cultures to act as though it isn't? I can see no obvious reasons for why this should be so.

Foodforthought,feb4wzd,t1_fdhztxs,1578955440.0,"So your POV isn't wrong here, but you're talking about tactical details, while Van Riper's point was a strategic, theatre-level critique about what we realistically ought to be prepared for (and the ridiculousness of forbidding asymmetrical warfare as an option for an opponent that we already know we are conventionally superior to). He was, in part, saying that the entire concept behind the Millenium Challenge was flawed and a waste of time - that the exercise was a stupid waste of resources, intended to simulate a type of war that we had no good reasons to expect would ever occur in the near future. A type of conflict we had every reason to believe we were already superior in, and hence which was not worth (alone) an elaborate once-every-decade-or-so scale wargame. 

And he was right. Just a few years later, U.S. forces executed a brilliant conventional warfare strategy, and breezed through the military forces of two different nation-states in a few years, one of which was the fourth largest standing army in the world at that time.

And then the U.S. absolutely botched the entire rest of both conflicts, getting battered by the exact sort of strategic shift that Van Riper was whining about - and  importantly, *failing to meet their actual wartime objectives*, and hence, arguably losing both wars. Part of the very reason we are having more trouble with Iran now is that we completely fucked the balance in the Middle East by destabilizing one the primary regional barriers to Iranian hegemony. *This  escalation of trouble with Iran is ultimately the fault of short-sighted strategic policy by the American political and military establishment.*

So yes, you're absolutely right - the tactical aspects of war games are important, and troops need to practice dealing with both losing and winning. But that isn't what was at issue here."
Foodforthought,feb1tml,t1_fdri64w,1578954632.0,"I think it's really inaccurate to compare a conventional force at the dawn of modern warfare that was completely caught with its pants down, by an experienced force that was superior in essentially every way, and which had correctly grasped and executed on key principles of what would come to be known as maneuver warfare, to the Millennium Challenge exercise. 

Additionally, I think the argument that Van Riper's flaw was modeling asymmetrical warfare in a conventional warfare exercise is, again, missing the point. 

Part of what Van Riper was trying to point out is that modeling a war with ""Iran"" and restricting it to only conventional warfare is a stupid thing to do. There is no question that the U.S. is superior to Iran in pretty much every way when it comes to conventional warfare. Hence a realistic exercise should model what a real nation might actually do when it finds itself so outmatched, and knows it - as Iran most certainly does. Van Riper's point about what sort of conflicts America should expect and prepare for was not just correct but prescient - we did end up in asymmetric conflicts, and we completely botched them, too, by failing to correctly prepare. We were putting on grand (and very expensive) Millennium Challenges that had very little to do with the actual future conflicts we should have known to expect.  

Complaining that Van Riper is ruining your *exercise* by insisting that it include realistic options for enemy responses - options like a turn to, or employment of, asymmetric warfare - is a baffling complaint, honestly. I agree with you that he handled the incident poorly overall. If he was trying to get his views heard with respect and implemented, he failed. 

But, respectfully, you're still focused on tactical details that don't actually matter - Van Riper's point was strategic, and the particular tactics employed in the games by him are pretty much irrelevant to what he was trying to get across."
WarCollege,fea1ux8,t1_fe7ldrd,1578943485.0,"I assumed that the question was asking about factors that weren't obvious. Of course the Marine Corps budget is smaller, in part, because it is the smallest service, and operates less expensive equipment. That does not explain why they have rejected chances to grow their budget(s), returned money to Congress, or otherwise not pursued service expansion. The number of roles the Marine Corps has played in the U.S. military makes their continued pursuit of small size and budget non-obvious. 

You also say ""no nuclear reactors"" as though it were obvious why they have none. The U.S. has contemplated, and at various times tested or tried to implement, nuclear *everything*. Nuclear bombers, fighters, artillery. Nuclear *farming*. What is obvious about the Marine Corps *not* trying to get in on the nuclear craze, when nuclear capability was defining American warfighting capability - or at least its conflicts - for about 40 years? 

In any case, there's an extended discussion of the cultural factors I list in *Making the Corps*, by Tom Ricks - where Ricks interviews various Marine Corps commandants about Marine culture, and how the service interprets its own history. This notion of frugality has had a strong effect on the Marine Corps's history, *if only because the Marines acted as though they believed their existence was under threat, and changed to meet that threat*. 

Let me emphasize that: it doesn't matter whether this Marine Corps mythology is true. But it does matter if the Marines act as though it were.

But please, feel free to make a substantive comment with more analysis, if you have one. ""They're small"" is not exactly high level stuff. If you're gonna be sarcastic, you should at least one-up me and offer something worth reading, yourself."
WarCollege,fe4vwcx,t1_fe3xt4z,1578863279.0,"The short of it boils down to two main reasons (the history of which is actually really interesting but which I don't have time to fully elaborate):

1) Many Americans would be surprised to hear this, but many American presidents, Congressmen, and other military leaders have tried to get rid of the Marine Corps - to fold it into other services or get rid of it entirely and then farm its roles out to other branches. Truman, for example, loathed the Marine Corps. 

This has led the Marine Corps to be cautious about how much resources it asks for, and to volunteer for jobs that other services don't want: it is institutionally eager to demonstrate that it always accomplishes the mission, *any* mission the country gives it. (This is encapsulated within the Corps by the proverb: ""Never tell a general that you don't do windows.)

Additionally, they strive to accomplish those missions at ""bargain"" rates in terms of how much money they will need to ask Congress for. 

By being high value, low budget, they expect to make themselves difficult to get rid of.

2) Culturally, this attitude within the Marine Corps, adopted as a matter of survival, has been narrativized and subsequently enshrined as a sort of virtue - part of the Marine ethos. 

Marines idolize (and heavily mythologize) the Spartans, and tend to see themselves in terms of what Marines see as Spartan values. So what began as self-preservation is talked about as if it were simply the natural outgrowth of a frugal, austere, and laconic culture. Marines believe that they can not only do more with less than other services, but that doing so is good for them - that it puts them within a warrior ethos. ""Every Marine is a rifleman."" To Marines, all you need is a Marine and his rifle - give them that and they will accomplish the mission. 

They really mean it, too - the Marine Corps has actually refused budget increases that were offered to them multiple times, and multiple times they have given money back to Congress at the end of the fiscal year, because they didn't need to spend it. 

Which is the complete opposite of how defense budgets usually work - the common wisdom is to never say no to money, and to spend everything you have, because if you don't, Congress will take that as a sign that your budget can be slashed. 

So the short answer to the question of why Marines work with a shoestring budget is: 

1) They try to give the biggest possible bang for the least possible bucks so that America doesn't get rid of her Marines, and,

2) They've decided this austerity is a core part of their ethos, and so they don't necessarily want a large slice of the pie, and don't ask for it."

I never saw the weapons fired, either, because the only Marines I knew of that had their weapons modified were a PSD for an officer meeting one of ours. Our platoons were pretty widely separated - we were running just squad-sized elements in some areas. Plenty of Marines I only saw a few times on that deployment except at the end.

I know for sure they were modifying it, though, because they offered to do mine if I wanted, when they noticed I was looking at what they were doing - which I declined.
