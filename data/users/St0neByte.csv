gifs,ffj9zii,t1_ffii7ef,1579993901.0,1 lap around a track is 400 meters. 4 laps is 1600 meters. 1 mile is 1609.344 meters. 4:30 for 1600 meters is insane. Like not flat out sprinting but flat out running the whole time. My best 400m in middleschool was 69 seconds. I was still a kid but that was flat out the whole time. The best mile I ever ran was sub 5 min. I can't imagine nearing 4:30 it sounds impossible.

Because of their agility, live ones have been known to hitch rides on vessels and end up in random bodies of water. The only reason we don't consider them invasive is because they have a rough time breeding outside of their native breeding grounds. Almost every major body of water in the world has at least a few though because their life spans are relatively long. I made all of this up."

videos,fffshvi,t1_fffre9i,1579890833.0,No. No it's not. It's better to have as much of the subjects of the video in frame as possible. There are plenty of times to shoot/watch verticle video.
