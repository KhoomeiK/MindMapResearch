For me, the all time oddest mix, was the use of Smashing Pumkins' ""Today,"" a song about suicide and depression, in a visa ad.

todayilearned,ff6rl0l,t1_ff6qqmb,1579633408.0,"Cost of prosecution of a capital case, including appeals, can be  a lot more expensive.

rocksmith,ff61e68,t3_erqhpm,1579616653.0,"You can try turning up the gain setting. Oddly, I have the opposite problem with most clean tones that will break up, and I have to roll back the output on these. This problem is mainly with acoustic tones.

There are a couple of older DLC songs that the clean tone gets lost for me. I do have the main music mixed to 80, so the guitar stands out, but these tones still get lost. I have a keyboard shortcut to a clean tone that I like, and I will just switch it on the fly for these songs."
financialindependence,ff60hnx,t1_ff5k1b5,1579615963.0,"This is the intended result. Another backdoor retirement account, with greater flexibility, while looking like it helps everyone with healthcare costs. Not many people are able to contribute the $7,100 that is the current max for HSA accounts. Only the wealthiest will be able to contribute the $29,500/yr.

To answer another question below, HSAs can basically function as an IRA account, with the same investment options. After 65, they basically become an traditional IRA with medical expenses being tax free, and other expenses are taxable but penalty free.

I don't think this is going to go anywhere. Too much potential hit to tax revenue."

Then follow up with asking what you need to do for a raise? I would leave out the point about your co-workers. They should be aware of the pay difference and you want to keep the conversation on your performance, not your coworkers."
