TwoXChromosomes,ffjgkpa,t1_ffjg6vb,1579997795.0,I actually looked at both Dutton papers and couldn't figure out which one was the one they were citing.
NoStupidQuestions,ffjdctu,t3_etym03,1579995895.0,"The reaction that we know as ""burning"" requires a fuel containing hydrogen atoms bound to another atom, usually carbon althout in your question it would be another hydrogen atom. The hydrogen is heated until it has enough energy to escape the molecules being burned in order to bond to oxygen in the air to create water. This reaction gives off heat which causes more electrons to bind to oxygen.

Now how do you figure flooding the reacting materials in water, thus removing the ambient O2 and providing only oxygen that is already bonded to hydrogen would help the reaction?"
TwoXChromosomes,ffjccpa,t1_ffj9mer,1579995319.0,"There's a reason we have style guidelines. You shouldn't expect people to have to dig to find your sources. Also we know of two Duttons already in the field, are you certain there isn't a third paper from that year that we've missed? No, you can't be.

Whoever wrote this paper has provided worse citations than would be expected of a high school student. I don't care to read it or give any regard to what this paper says. While the sources it cites are much more valid than the paper itself, they are also individual sources stating one thing in a sea of sources stating otherwise."

TwoXChromosomes,ffj6qet,t1_ffj5lqm,1579991788.0,Well mostly the fact that they didn't cite their sources properly so I can't even look up the sources to verify that they say what the article says they say.

This is kind of off-topic, but I also hate when a game is *practically* unwinnable but your teammates won't FF because they want to ""practice"" playing from behind. The odds of you coming back from super far behind are already so low that maybe all that extra practice will increase your win rate by half a percent. It would be better to use that time practicing not getting to that point to begin with. Now coming back from a little behind is a great thing to practice, but once they're up four dragons and its 3-28 and they've taken eight towers to your one, maybe just give up."

Or, y'know, you could act like a few people's perceptions of the situation are more valuable than empirical evidence collected through controlled testing.

Now it IS NOT the same as seeing a doctor, but she doesn't realize that.

On the other hand, she may be one of the people who think that mental illness is caused by laziness or other similar factors that a person can choose to overcome. If that's the case, then you should explain to her that a mental illness is a real physiological problem.
