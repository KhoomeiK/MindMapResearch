scooters,ex1z3pl,t3_cqxdmt,1565959320.0,"I have a roughhouse 50 sport. I am 6 foot 240 and it is plenty big  for me. It goes 40+ mph easily. If I had it to do over I would have not bought the sport model and saved a few bucks.
I also have a Yamaha Zuma 4 stroke. It is better in every respect. If you want new for $2000 buy a genuine, you’ll love it. But if resale is really important a used Zuma or a Honda Ruckus is a way better investment. My Yamaha has over 10,000 miles on it and still feels like brand new."
