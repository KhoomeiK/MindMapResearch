AskReddit,ffb5hek,t3_eskc2n,1579752316.0,"Years ago, I was in a clan with a guy with a big ego.  It was a sword-fighting, mostly skill-based game, and I was the only female.  He went around bragging about how he got laid by a random chick because his name was at the top of the leaderboards in our clan hall (best kill/death ratio).  So that night I did enough duels and arena matches to get my name at the very top.  And then I made an alt with a slight variation of my name and I did it again.  And again.  And again.  And again.  Till the leaderboard was nothing but my name and a few other decent players active at that time, and his name fell off. 

I seem to recall he was slightly salty about it.  

Slight tangent I suppose, but I guess having your name on the leaderboard makes some girls want to bang.  Surprisingly enough it didn’t work the other way around."

AskReddit,feye931,t1_fey9lfz,1579444286.0,Oh geez.  My brother used to store files he’d deleted “but wasn’t 100% sure he was done with” in the recycle bin and he always got mad at me for emptying it.  I kept telling him to just make a folder called AlmostJunk or DontDeleteMe but he never learned.
pics,feuammw,t1_fesg4t4,1579384756.0,Used to live in the Ohio snowbelt.  We’d regularly have 3-5 feet of snow on the ground.  Our doors didn’t get snowed in like this but we’d have to shovel out our driveway and cars all the time.  It wasn’t super unusual for me to walk outside and I literally could not see my car - maybe a tiny red mirror sticking helplessly out of a snowbank where the snowplow had helped bury my Acura.
news,femz9w3,t1_femsl6t,1579273392.0,"I’ve never had problems with the TSA over insulin, but we did have  a moment of panic when my husband absent-mindlessly pulled out his pump and held it out at arm’s length with all the tubing trailing down and under his coat - looking for all the world like some sort of bomb device.  Thankfully it was private security at an aquarium and they didn’t do anything but startle and do a double-take but I warned him to be much more careful after that."
AskReddit,fem0f4f,t1_felcdyj,1579235772.0,Wait... decorating Kitchen Aids is a thing?  Why didn’t anyone tell me??
aww,feevhl9,t1_feep6bv,1579042097.0,Oh!  I adjusted the lighting on my phone and it’s much less noticeable now.  It looked like he’d rolled in blue paint powder before.  I have a cat and that’s totally something he would do and then sulk when I laughed at him.
AskReddit,feeqtlh,t1_fed72qk,1579039253.0,"I find this very odd - I’m a woman so I don’t know for sure but I’ve heard from people around me that most large public places have them now.  It’s common to put the changing table on the wall inside the handicap stall - could it be that people just don’t know where to look?

Granted, not all places have them at all, in either gender’s bathroom.  For some reason, Asian-food restaurants (in America) seem to have an almost zero chance of having them."
aww,feep1fq,t3_eolrba,1579038225.0,"Why is part of his face blue?  Doesn’t look like a lighting issue. 

But cute cat!"
AskReddit,fdmg86o,t1_fdmcji1,1578548850.0,"The problem is that maybe she doesn’t like physical contact but shows love in other ways.  You’re probably a wonderful person but just because someone is family doesn’t mean that there might not be a bad person in the lot.  If a girl doesn’t want to hug great-uncle Joe or cousin-in-law Paul, she shouldn’t have to.  And obviously there’s a difference between gentle suggestion and direct orders, but I hope she gets to make her own choice."
funny,fdi37u9,t1_fdhqhsi,1578434928.0,They’re usually in almost any hard candy mix you buy at the drug story or grocery store.  You just have to sort through away all the butterscotch and peppermints to get to the strawberries.
news,fc43uli,t3_eg0shv,1577405928.0,"My doctor’s office and the entire health system around here uses a hand scanner as an option to sign in, as opposed to, you know, telling the receptionist.  The scanner is at their desk so the wait time is the same.  I refuse to use it."
aww,fc1smoe,t1_fc1lmfa,1577328435.0,"I do salt dough fairly often for my kids’ handprints.  You can put food dye in it to color it (knead it well) before you bake it, you can also paint it.  If they live in a humid or wet climate you may want to consider some sort of sealer when it’s done.  My handprints have lasted quite well in my dry area but the ones I sent to my mother actually grew mold and broke eventually."
