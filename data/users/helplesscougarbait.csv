technews,fe5s7k5,t1_fe2lnmx,1578873801.0,"I’m leaning towards no. I don’t think the Hummer’s target audience was super concerned about gas consumption. Maybe the cost of fuel at the time deterred people, but reviving a brand of trucks targeted to people who think electric vehicles are for hippies doesn’t make sense from a business perspective.

This seems like a dumb idea someone is going to get a huge bonus for today, and then a nice severance package when they are forced to resign in two years because they ran the company into the ground again. 

GM got a bailout years ago because they call themselves ‘job creators’. Wasn’t it last year or the year before that they eliminated over ten thousand jobs in the US?"

Meditation,fdyzje6,t3_en7n2s,1578785186.0,"I don’t think there is some magical phrase that will profoundly affect your life by simply repeating.

I also don’t believe that focusing on breath in and of itself will unlock the secrets of the universe.

Focusing on an abstract or repetitive notion helps your brain stop being a control freak about your thought processes and let your mind step out of itself for a while.

If it feels silly to you, make up your own mantra or affirmation. If that just doesn’t work for you, find something else simple to focus on entirely."
