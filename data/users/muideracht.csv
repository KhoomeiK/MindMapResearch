You should just watch Temple of Doom! It will answer your question *and* it was a great movie."

baseball,ffghddx,t1_fffmf1c,1579906264.0,"I think there would've been a very easy way to punish players without getting into a tussle with the union: take their rings away! I don't mean physically, but like just make it so the MLB doesn't recognize them as champions. Sure, this is probably still not going far enough, but it would sting like hell. It would at least be a compromise instead of a complete free pass for the players involved.

Also, it would de-incentivise this type of cheating, since in the end $5 mil, a lost GM and manager and some lost draft picks would not actually have meant a championship."

The reason I don't agree with this is because you have to remember, not everyone devotes as much time to looking for new music. I do, because I'm a music guy. It's one of my things. Other people have different things and view music as just something pleasant to have on in the background. As such, they spend more time on their other hobbies and not as much seeking out new music to challenge themselves or open their minds or whatever, so they just kind of listen to what they know."
