metalguitar,ffqz2es,t3_euqhqy,1580146854.0,"I wish I knew that you shouldn't get frustrated if you can't play your favorite songs immediately or even after a decent amount of time. All of our guitar heroes have many decades of experience which most of us do not have, and so I find comparing ourselves to them to be an exercise in futility that only serves to discourage.

I think we as metal guitarists are cursed in that many of our favorite songs or learning staples are by their nature incredibly complex in terms of the precision, speed, and dexterity required to make them sound good, meaning that we often struggle when trying to learn them. Black Sabbath, for instance, typically isn't very musically complex, but there's no debate that Tony's mastery of the pentatonic minor scale for solos is unrivaled (""It's only 5 notes, how hard could it be?""), and as a result it can be difficult to learn them exactly as he wrote them.

In a similar vein, I wish I knew that it's OK to make alterations and changes to a solo or a riff that you like if they sound better to you or if they're easier for you to nail at your current level of experience. Going back to Black Sabbath, I play Paranoid and War Pigs differently than they were recorded and are typically taught, for both of the reasons I mentioned earlier."

It was absolutely insane. Reactor 4 blew up and the next day the Soviets told the residents of Pripyat that the radioactive dust falling from the sky was nothing to be alarmed by, and to ignore it. Meanwhile, they were hastily treating the first responders without telling them that there was essentially zero chance of survival since the radiation dose they got was so insanely high. When civilians started getting sick, the doctors treated them as best they could but were forbidden from telling them what was actually wrong with them. The residents only really found out about the catastrophe when nuclear scientists in Sweden (Finland? Can't quite remember which Nordic country it was) started wondering out loud why their testing equipment was picking up huge spikes in radiation as the wind blew the fallout cloud north, since even as they were being evacuated, the Soviets told the residents of Pripyat that they'd be able to come back in a few days once they'd dealt with the problem. When the cleanup effort finally started, the ""liquidators"" (as they were called) had to work in 40 second shifts to avoid absorbing a lethal dose of radiation. Hundreds of them still died in the following weeks and months of ARS, let alone those who died later of cancer and other illnesses.

uofmn,ffdj2li,t1_ffcilzl,1579821927.0,"Sharing a meal is very much in the same vein as communism. The most basic idea of a communist society is that resources are pooled and divided equally (taking into account individual need and ability). One person at the table might prefer one dish to another. Another might be allergic to a specific ingredient, so must substitute one dish for another in order to come away from the meal happy. The rest of the people at the table (assuming that they are empathetic and caring) must then compensate for these factors, dividing up resources (food) according to them, taking more or less of certain items so that everyone can enjoy a sufficiently filling meal. Going even further, if everyone splits the check, the monetary resources of each individual person go towards funding the acquisition of food for the group, even if the value of the food eaten by each person may have been different or if each person cannot contribute an equal amount of money towards the bill. That is a communist act, plain and simple. According to Google, communism is ""a political theory...leading to a society in which all property is publicly owned and each person works and is paid according to their abilities and needs"". In this metaphor, the society is the group at the table, and the pay is the food.

The ""problems with communism"" are as much a result of the people who tried implementing it (either faithfully or as a facade for their own power grabs) as they are with the system itself. The same could be said for capitalism, as well. By its nature, an insufficiently-regulated capitalist economy rewards those who exploit others, either for labor or for resources. The fact that less than 200 people have access to the same amount of resources as half of the world population is outrageous. Nobody ""earns"" that much money or capital. Jeff Bezos was given something like $250,000 to start Amazon. Same with Trump-he was born into a real estate empire that despite his repeated crimes somehow has stayed in business. Same with the nauseating Kardashians-their family was already famous since Robert was OJ Simpson's lawyer. Same with Bill Gates-for all his good work, his father was a lawyer with connections in DC which got his foot in the door for a lot of business opportunities. Each of those people could give up almost all of their wealth and capital and not even notice it in their day-to-day lives. They'd still have their diamond-encrusted iPhones and golden shitters and private jets and all of it, but they won't because they're greedy fucks and nothing about our economic system motivates them to.

And authoritarianism is not limited to communist governments. It just takes one look at Donald Trump or Boris Johnson or India's Modi or Rodrigo Duterte or Xi Jinping. It's all over the globe. I think right now is not the greatest time to be decrying the dangers of progressive politics."

uofmn,ffcg6bh,t1_ffbiywx,1579798757.0,"I mean, they might just have more faith in their fellow person than I do. Assuming that the laws are implemented fairly and that whatever means of decision-making existed was truly representative of the will of the people, there’s nothing inherently wrong with communism. In fact, communism and democracy are not mutually exclusive. One is an economic system, the other is a legislative one.

Sharing a meal with family and/or friends is communist. Pitching in for gas money on a road trip is communist. Lending your lawnmower to your neighbor is communist. Donating to a charity is communist. The basic principle is that of shared resources so that all parties come away with their needs met. We all do this every day. The problem arises when this manner of living is implemented at a large scale. I personally would love to live in an altruistic society where poverty and homelessness and other societal ills are taken care of by way of collective effort, whether that’s tax dollars or volunteer work or whatever. I just think that’s not likely to happen."
uofmn,ffbf13m,t1_ffbdrx4,1579762466.0,"I don't have a favorable view of communism. I have a favorable view of a society or community that does what it can to ensure that all of its members have the same opportunities, whether that means socialized healthcare (in whatever form), subsidized housing or other living assistance for those who demonstrate legitimate need, free (or heavily subsidized) higher education, things of that nature. It just so happens that in order for that to take place, the society by definition needs to adopt socialist policies in some form or another, the extreme of which is full-on communism.

I'm not a communist. I would never advocate for communism simply because of what I previously said-I do not think that our society is nearly altruistic enough to make that work. That said, I see no reason why socialized healthcare and higher education are not already a thing in the US. This is the wealthiest country in the world, and every credible model predicts that both of those would pay for themselves very quickly. Plus, y'know, every other developed country has these in some form and they're doing fine."
uofmn,ffb7h7g,t1_ffb5gm4,1579753933.0,"Communist countries have pretty much always been authoritarian. That does not mean that an authoritarian country is automatically communist. China is communist just as North Korea is communist-that is to say, not communist at all when subjected to any level of scrutiny beyond face value. For example, the farmers in North Korea might “own” their farm and therefore the means of production, but the state demands that most or all of their product is given to the state to be distributed, usually inequitably with extreme favor given to those deemed “desirable” by the Party. By contrast, most Chinese companies are free to pretty much do as they please-that is, assuming that the executives play ball with the CCP and do the government favors when asked, like how it’s strongly suspected that Huawei has implemented surveillance hardware in its export products at the direction of the CCP. Both countries claim to be communist or at least used to, but both countries are communist in name only. Think *Animal Farm*.

Communism in its “pure” form is predicated entirely upon the ideal that everyone in a communist society be both generous with their giving and not greedy with their taking. Unfortunately, this kind of society doesn’t really seem to work outside of the early nomadic tribes in which everyone had a role that was performed for the betterment of all members of the group and deviation from or taking advantage of the rest of the group was easily identified and punished. For this reason, I think it’s unlikely that a true communist society will exist on a large scale, and if it does, it will quickly become corrupt and therefore unstable."

I think you’re going to struggle to find what I’m pretty sure you want for that price and it’s better to hold out for a bigger budget than to buy something that isn’t exactly what you want, figure that out, sell it (most likely for a loss), and then try and find something different.

I was passing her (slowly because I was just doing slightly faster than she was) and she started changing lanes right as I was level with her car. I only noticed when I thought I was starting to drift in my lane and when I saw it was her moving towards me I had to swerve the other way.

But you and I both know that tons of parents and uncles and aunts buy kids M-rated games because they probably don’t know what’s shown in them and don’t care enough to find out beforehand. That’s not the studio’s fault, but it’s a problem that exists.

news,fdu06un,t1_fdtwbgw,1578725167.0,"It’s exactly the same comparison. You don’t have to listen. You can play with no sound. But of course that’s not how the game is intended to be played. You’re intended to play with sound to experience the game how the developers wanted you to experience it, exactly as how IW put every combat cue and animation in No Russian that was present in every other level to convey that the intended way to play was to participate. It’s exactly the same thing. Nobody ever in the history of video games has played a Call of Duty game and not begun fighting as soon as the cutscene ends and your HUD pops up and your allies start shooting. You don’t need a big objective indicator over your gun to tell you you can fire it because that information was given to you in the tutorial.

All of you guys getting butthurt that someone has a different point of view really need to get a reality check. I’m not saying MW2 was a bad game. I’m not saying IW are bad people for including that scenario in the game. I’m not saying that your vidya should be censored by the evil gubmint or whoever the fuck else would be responsible for that. All I’m saying is that I think the media frenzy over this scene was at least partly justified if for no other reason than a whole bunch of parents probably realized that they shouldn’t have bought their kids a game that had that kind of subject matter in it. Whether or not you or I personally agree with that sentiment is beside the point."

Whether or not you “had” to, the obvious thing to do based on the entire rest of the game was to shoot it up. It wasn’t like there was an easter egg that unlocked the ability to shoot, since the ready-weapon animation plays right before your buddies start shooting.

For a game played (at the time) mainly by kids, it wasn’t really a good look for Infinity Ward to be allowing the player to participate in a terrorist attack depicted as it was, simulated or not, especially when the player is being nudged to play a part. Sure, *technically* you didn’t have to, but that’s like saying kids don’t *technically* have to listen to to the racial slurs or pick up prostitutes in the GTAV single player. The problematic part is the fact that the option exists at all in a game played for the most part by children. I’m not saying the studios are or should be responsible for policing content in M-rated games, I’m just saying that I think the media shitstorm was justified to a certain extent because way too many parents give their kids games like that which are absolutely not intended for children simply because they’re ignorant of what’s shown."

I don’t remember hearing about how Obama was endorsed by the Klan or how his rhetoric is likely one of the leading causes of increases in violence against minorities. I don’t remember hearing Obama speak and reading things he wrote and questioning whether he was mentally capable or stable enough to hold the office of the presidency. I don’t remember hearing about school shootings and domestic terrorist attacks on the news and wondering if the people affected would even want to hear from Obama or meet with him after the tragedy.
