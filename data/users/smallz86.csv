AskReddit,fenw2ka,t1_femsr5k,1579291729.0,"Well, 37 hours is more than enough to file for the ACA:  Under the ACA, a full-time employee is an employee who works on average either 1) 30 hours or more per workweek or 2) 130 hours during a month. Employers that have more than 50 employees who meet either of these full-time thresholds are required to comply with the ACA.   


Secondly, there is no federal law which says what is full time:  The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer. Whether an employee is considered full-time or part-time does not change the application of the FLSA."
