Anyway.

So... don’t try and look older but definitely let your mind show your confidence and wisdom. Take shit from no one. If someone tries to pull a fast one, dazzle then with knowledge. Be sure to slow your pace and lower your tone. Not condescending but... think radio dj. Listen to how the women talk. (The ones you don’t find annoying. If they are annoying... don’t imitate them).

Most people will be embarrassed for assuming an age wrong which actually gives you a bit more leverage for negotiating.

I’m not judging. It happens. We all forget to step back and look at the life of our partner and really get perspective of what they need and what they can offer us. 

I also feel like there are two areas needing advice here.

Bf needs to put his foot down and tell mom that he will only answer her call if he is the second call she makes. He will no longer tolerate the calls that make him feel useless if she doesn’t make the call to the police. I know you said the cops won’t do anything. However, she needs to call them, record every incident and if they refuse to do anything after two months of recording, constant calls and reports.... she hires a lawyer to sue the police department and to press harassment charges against  the neighbor. 

Next. Being out of work, not having a car and relying on your gf (especially when you are a much older male) is ONE HELL of a hit to your ego, self esteem and self worth. He probably feels like utter shit about himself. 
Now.. imagine you gain 20#’s, can’t cook, can’t clean and can’t be intimate... what would you feel you have to offer him? (No feminist please... this is not a hard fast rule... it’s simply setting an assumed scene). 

Would you feel worthy of his time? Or would you bundle up in despair and feel unworthy of his time? 

Set your wants and needs aside for a little bit and support him in his world on his terms. See what you can do to bring some level of peace to him. 

Maybe layout a plan for dealing with the neighbor? Have a consult with a lawyer (some give free or if you go to your local bar Assc. They can give you referrals that come with a sharp consult (like $25 for first 30min)).

Offer to answer his phone from time to time if it’s his mom and take the venting for him. 

Any little thing you can do to ease his stress and help him get grounded again will go a long way. Not only in saving your relationship but in building it stronger. If he’s truly a good man he will see your efforts, how you supported him and he will be grateful for that and bring you closer to his heart over time.

Advice,ffi2mbf,t1_ffi1yti,1579963265.0,"Yeah... no... they don’t use stitches just cause they are fun to do.

The only other option would be surgical adhesive, if they even allow it to be used there.

It’s purple, and dark and no promise of less scaring.

Where did you get your information from?


If you are truly worried about scaring, you would need to see a plastic surgeon. They would be the best bet to ensure minimal scars and best appearance after removal. Most insurances won’t cover this but, get a referral and find out. Sometimes dr’s know how to work the system. 

Most regular dr’s aren’t trained in minimal scaring, newest technology or ultra fine threads. 

Regardless, you can put a bandaid over anything and stitches or no stitches, you will still have a bandaid on your lip and that’s not cool in selfies.
