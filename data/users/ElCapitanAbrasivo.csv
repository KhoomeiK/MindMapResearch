politics,ffexv1f,t3_et00sa,1579869807.0,Facebook and Soros...two sides of the same shitty coin. Unfortunately neither one of these two will just go away.
canada,ffcxtqz,t3_esugva,1579809507.0,"Sounds like a pipe dream. Look at how much we pay in income and sales taxes already *without* this. $22,000 x 30 million is 660 billion dollars. Reach into your couches."

ottawa,ff4f3s8,t3_erjtfh,1579562101.0,This is inexcusable. It looks like they meant well with the cardboard but we're responsible to think about their wellbeing more than they are.

canada,ff2zgd9,t1_ff2d39m,1579529504.0,Anyone that remembers what they did to Zahra Kazemi in life and in death would be surprised it took this long. I had hoped they actually would be cooperative but a zebra doesn't change its stripes I guess.
holdmyfeedingtube,ff2xile,t1_ff2whn3,1579527772.0,"I just did, so yeah - that's how it works.

Actually I put the blame on everybody involved. Downvote this too you bitch-ass pearl-clutchers.

EDIT: you owe it to yourself to be aware of your surroundings on a bicycle, especially when you're surrounded by asshole drivers, like when you're in China and North America.This person did not *deserve* what they got but they got it anyway. And you'll get it too if you're not smart."

I'm actually just going to make my own with a web guide someone posted a while back. It'll cost me around $150 but a pain in the ass I'd pay $150 not to deal with."

canada,fenioyy,t3_eq2xne,1579285535.0,"I get it, but Canada didn't shoot down the plane. And if Iran decides not to pay, we shouldn't be on the hook. In fact if Iran does pay, I have doubts the government will offset any of this money with it."
