Parenting,fdwchgt,t3_emxtyq,1578757313.0,I had a moment when my daughter wanted friends over for like the millionth time. I said why dont you go to their houses. She said because it's just more comfortable at home and my friends all feel loved welcomed at our house even when we get in trouble so they always want to come here.
family,fcxd28d,t3_ejf4xx,1578059643.0,Doublings?
TrueOffMyChest,fcvj8n3,t3_eivnty,1578003258.0,Yes I say this constantly . I too am a teacher and preach this to the parents. My son has a immunity issue and get sick with the change of the wind. So when you come sick I carry these germs to my home where my son catches it nearly every single time. Then I'm out and they wondering why I am always having to get a sub. I literally lysol myself before leaving my classroom. Lysol my entire classroom before and after class. I'm close to taking a change of clothes with me. And yes I will for sure call parents to come get your kid.
family,fcvi94a,t1_fcvi0rj,1578002650.0,Also she too has chronic illnesses that make her sick for days at a time. So that's another thing she  brought up
family,fcvi0rj,t1_fcvg1to,1578002508.0,"Well like you shes not very kid friendly. She loves my kids but admittted she  didn't think she would be able to handle them day and night no matter the age because she isn't use to sharing her space like that. She felt like in a time of need like losing their parents she wouldnt be able to help get them through a difficult time such as that. She was honest I know my sister well enough to know the truth in it. I then asked her if i chose someone else like my mother or a very close family friend if she would be willing to part time help which that was easier for her to say yes too. However I think if It truly came down to it she probably would reconsider but not having that certain pressure of it looming over her helps.
Just be honest. I love you and the kids but I don't think we are the correct choice for such an impacting decision on their and our lives. I wouldn't feel guilty about it. This is a huge responsibility and should not be taken lightly. Now you can easily say yes and pray nothing ever happens but we are not guaranteed tomorrow so it takes some thought"

Parenting,fclwmng,t3_eht4a6,1577758257.0,Depends on the place I guess. I use to work at a daycare in the 4 year olds class. A d i was alone with 18 kids we had designated potty times. But sometimes they just have to go bit when that happens I had to call someone to come take the kid to the bathroom a d most the time it was never timely so they always had accidents..  to me that was so wrong of them so I started taking them in between our designated times a d would always get in trouble but hey! no more accidents!. Now I'm a prek teacher with a bathroom right in our class so thank goodness I dont have to worry a bit that anymore

Since he is making grunts and sounds. To help him, say  if he is pointing and grunting for something, tell him ""oh you want the cracker "" tell him to say it even it only sounds like it you are making him use words and will eventually say whole words and eventually on his own (as long as there isn't anything else wrong) my ""nephew"" would do this because he didnt have to use words because his mother would give him anything just him.pointing at it then at 4 when he didnt have a great vocabulary she wondered why. School told her he just points and screams for things he wanted and she admitted that was her fault so thats how we were told to train him to use words. He didnt have a disability of any kind"

I have hyperacusis and noises are 100 times louder to me. A simple buzzing of a light is loud and irritating to me. My mom said she use to put earmuffs on me or otherwise I'd cry constantly (she feels to drown out whatever noise was bugging me) 
I'm a teacher now and the noise of florescent light gives me a head ache so in my class I dont turn the florescent overhead on I have windows for the natural light ght and lamps with low watts. 
Just saying even something as sine as a light can create a noise to someone with a sensitivity"

She goes through phases, example for a while she was constantly worried about death. Not her own but every one else. Then she went through a phase where she had to say ""I love you"" or ""be careful"" at least a dozen times. Before it was ok for.her to move on. And of we didnt say anything back right away it got worse.  Then ot was hoarding. Like she would keep trash because the item in it was something someone have her and she feared it would make that person sad to see it in the trash (even tho it is trash) currently its ""is this *insert food item* expired?"" She wont eat anything close to expired or asks a million times if it's still good. Wont use a thin but plastic wear that no one else has touched. She has gone through what I called a super empathetic stage where everything made her sad because someone else was or she THOUGHT  they would be. It was hard to not get frustrated with her. And eventually had to take her therapy.  They told me shes sensitive to other peoples vibrations and can feel their feelimgs more then normal. And the other stuff if just an type anxiety .

 once my older one started school I had baby and I had more one on one time with baby. 
Older kid is a huge help
Didnt have 2 in diapers 

When they were little pros were more.
Now they are older (8&12) cons outweigh pros. Lol
They fight constantly. 2 different schools. (Elementary/middle school)
Once one is off to college I still have one for 4 more years lol If they were closer schooling would be easier.
