Advice,fetiz9t,t3_eqkzjy,1579375932.0,"That’s the opposite of how customer service is supposed to be...He should come 1) Not said anything to you. 2) Said, hey, I saw your review, let’s make this better! He doesn’t seem like he has the social skills typically seen in great business owners. I would tell my friends, word will spread, and you aren’t the only one he is probably making uncomfortable. I wouldn’t go back, not because he frightened me, but because it’s awkward and no cup of coffee is that good."
FundieSnark,fesk77h,t1_fermqyy,1579366085.0,"I think she poses this way because she *thinks* it makes her look less giant. It really just makes her head look tiny. More tiny, if that’s somehow possible."

FundieSnark,fepk73m,t3_eq9ch9,1579322632.0,"Why does she dress the way she does? She must know she has a man face, and she wears the most unflattering clothes and hats. I think she is actually a dude, but is Christian so she has to hide it."

DunderMifflin,fepge74,t3_eqazf5,1579319835.0,"Good catch! I’ve never noticed that before, and I’ve seen the series countless times. I love how the writers packed it with teeny details like that!"

wholesomebpt,fep3sk1,t3_epl83g,1579311497.0,Both seem like awesome people! I love when influential people show kindness in such an open format. It’s sends such a positive message. It’s cool to be nice 👍🏼
wholesomebpt,fep3nrl,t3_eoutxy,1579311410.0,"This is really neat. What a strange feeling that would be, to finally see someone that looks like you, show up on tv after seeing so many other people who you don’t look like. I hope this happens more and more! Beauty is so much more than what we see with the eye!"
DunderMifflin,fep3d27,t3_eq9owa,1579311219.0,Truth! I have one friend who loves to call. It took a while to get adjusted to actually talking and not texting! I suppose it’s a good skill to keep up with though.

I’m thinking it’s probably kids, who don’t know how frightening it is. Getting the knocker removed is another good choice."

Advice,fenlyam,t1_fenglaq,1579287519.0,"I agree. It was very vain of her to say. She is very pretty and well off, I do fine, I’m a happy person :) I think her saying that just made me realize how different we are, and it hurt. I know if I told her it hurt my feelings she would feel awful. I think. She is a judge mental person, she thinks she is right about most everything."
Advice,fenlrhu,t1_fenen17,1579287402.0,"Well, part is I think she is a little jealous. She just had her 3rd child, our family is going on vacation and she’s having a hard time. I usually just laugh off her honest remarks, but this one hurt. I don’t think I’m pretty, but I guess I didn’t know she thought I wasn’t...I guess I needed advice for how to handle it, or just move on."

Advice,fengzv2,t3_eq2j7b,1579284488.0,"I’ve been working on making friends this year, so small talk has been a big part of that. It can take a lot of courage to step out of your comfort zone and talk to new folks! I think being genuine is a great way to start off, a real smile, asking how they are, what do they do, how long have they lived here...things like that. I’ve noticed that strangers open up about a lot, once you get them over the new person feeling."
Advice,fenexxr,t3_eq1won,1579283231.0,"Like others have suggested, I would try to verify what is really true vs. what isn’t, seek out reliable sources to get the correct information. This is such a tough situation. If these allegations are true, he isn’t the friend you think that you have. He hasn’t been honest with you or your group, and I would wonder he true motives of wanting to become friends with you in the first place. Good luck, that’s a tragic thing."
Advice,feneedy,t3_eq3kqb,1579282902.0,"A little more info...My sister and I are very close, in age and friendship. We are very blunt with each other. My new friends are both talented and very beautiful, but it never occurred to me that someone would consider me unable to be their friend because I’m apparently not as pretty. Do I say something to my sister? Just move on?"

I’m convinced that this is why Derrick is becoming a lawyer, and that should scare Jim Bob and Josh and Michelle. He’s going though LAW SCHOOL TO BUST YOU. Slowly getting closer, years devoted to being able to ruin someone. It’s going to be incredible to watch. Lol."

I’m not doubting that Derrick and Jill have backwards beliefs, but he stood up to his wife’s abusive parents and got them out of there. He is a coward but this was a courageous step, and I think both of his boys will benefit from being out of the toxic Duggar environment."
