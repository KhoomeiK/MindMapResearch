I would advise you against over investing in empire for now, once your squad arena starts unlocking bastilla, they will crush your palpatine team.

Jedi's will give you your fastest route to a viable squad arena team. And that currently seems like something you value. Bastilla also benefits from not requiring specific Jedi, and will help you towards Jedi Knight revan.

The separatist route is a harder near term route, it's currently being recommended though because in the long term you will benefit, padme is fantastic as a late game character but needs a lot of specific surrounding characters as OP was stating.

 but again, it depends on your priorities, since Geo's could offset your losses in squad arena by giving you more crystals.

My advice would be to continue the Jedi route, since you're already set up well for it, you do need a dark side team, however, as well as a fleet, no reason you can't be building towards those with separatists/Geo's.

One BIG caveat, particularly, with fleet, it's worth checking how many people in your. Shard bought the hyper drive bundle. Fleet crystals are only really helpful in the top 20. 20 people easily could have bought the bundle in your fleet shard.

Geo fleet is typically run under Tarkin, but also can be used under the Chimera/Thrawn. 

Rebels were the last fleet Meta, They are great, but they require the Falcon to be relevant. Phoenix fleet doesnt help much until then."

I'm not implying she leaked it, i don't think she did, i don't care where it came from. It's dumb. 

I read one analysis or tweet or something that posited, how often do a husband and wife walk away from a conversation with two completely different ideas of what was said. Happens ALL OF THE TIME. I'm going to give both the benefit of the doubt and say they are both right. Warren heard something took it one way, Sanders said something and meant something else. If thats the case, then entertaining this issue is a mistake.

  
This conversation amounts to a he said / she said. There is no way to prove what was said, if it was a misunderstanding or if it was intentional. Which means its his word against hers. Which means there is no way EITHER of them can come out ahead on this issue.  It can only result in animosity by both sides and threaten the goals of all of us.

It's a strategic mistake on her part, because she is the only one who can end this story OR keep it going. If she tries to ignore it, the media will keep it going, if she tries to push it, bernie supporters will be upset and divide progressive support. Which means this situation is damned if you do, damned if you dont. So the only answer is to not play. 

The only strategic solution is for Warren to say that this a story being perpetuated by the media to divide the support between Bernie and I. And the media trying to fabricate an issue to divide progressive support in america is the real issue. 

Bernie can't say that. It will make it look like he's dismissing an issue. Only she can. And if she were to have said it last night, she would have gotten as much praise as bernie did when he said ""no one cares about your damn emails"". It was the best thing she could have done, and I truly wish she had people on her team who gave her that advice. Because this is dumb, truly dumb, and I don't want to see divisions created over the dumbest story and the dumbest issue which results in some centrist puppet losing to Trump in November."

ElizabethWarren,feiwuaf,t3_epdnef,1579149397.0,"Thank you,

I think a lot of this is bad faith actors trying to divide us, not sure how much of this on Twitter or Reddit is real.

One thing to add. This is a strategic mistake by Warren. This is a he said / she said and a real dumb hill to die on. It's a private conversation that should not be played out in public, and Warren permitting the MSM to make an issue out of this is a distraction and playing into MSM manipulation. There is literally no way Bernie or Warren can win this battle, so it should not be fought. 

The best thing she can do, is to kill this issue and story. Bernie has even demonstrated how to do it last election with his ""no one cares about your damn emails"" statement.

Bernie pointed out how the healthcare industry bought ads during the debate and Warren pointed out how these were right wing talking points. 

CNN has already shown their true colors time and time again. They are for the corporate status quo. 

I've watched every debate, i skipped this one, I already knew what was going to happen. CNN was going to try and divide Warren and Bernie supporters and attack progressive positions using right wing rhetoric. No point in watching. 

And to all of you Bernie and Warren supporters. DON'T TAKE THE BAIT. What matters is defeating these institutions and putting in place real change. The establishment will use whatever it takes to divide us and put in place KloBidenegieg"

What you could do is look at Warrior's youtube channel, he just quit SWGOH, but last year he had this series called scissorman where he started a new f2p account and livestreamed every week. The first fleet he went after was Geos, you could find the weeks where he unlocked fleet and see how he did. But at a min. the first video or two in the series i think he explains his strategy"
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,feid1j6,t1_feic5xe,1579135657.0,"It's tough for me to say, when i was at your point, fleet was unrecognizable to how it is now. Fleets had 5 ships starting for example, and most people cared less about fleet then because at the time there were no crystals.

But i would still recommend Geos, only 3 of them are relevant for fleet arena, and you dont need to have them at a certain star level, you just have to unlock them. Sun Fac you can get from Guild shipments (i don't know what is traditionally recommended as the first farm from there) Geo Soldier and Geo Spy are both early cantina farms, But all of them can be farmed from the fleet store in addition to the ships once you hit lvl 60.

And after you get zeb to a certain level, you can farm the ships from the GW store as well to speed up those farms"
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,feibxke,t1_feibahb,1579134913.0,"It will have to be lvl 85, especially for thrawn, other legendaries can probably be unlocked at lower levels, but thrawn needs 85.

There is no reason you shouldn't be doing both. You need to have a DS team anyway for nodes, traditionally that's been empire, but its worth looking at geos/separatists instead. Phx will be your LS team.

But your original question was in regards to fleet, and thats why geos are relevant, geos are the BEST early fleet you can have and now w/ malevolence they are still a great late game fleet.

What i would recommend is just not leveling anything else, all those other bad characters they give you early on should just be ignored. 

Last thing, in regards to legendaries and unlocks, you can also first work to getting everyone to 5 stars. 5 stars is enough to unlock thrawn or padme. So you can first farm up Phx to 5 then switch to Geos/Seps for their unlocks, then finish either of them up to 7 stars"
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,feiak3q,t1_feia24r,1579133995.0,"I'm f2p, it just takes time. For you, what i recommend is stop investing in phx once you get to g8. Gear 8 is enough to unlock thrawn and everything else. By the time you get thrawn you want to move away from phoenix. 

Phoenix stop being useful fairly early, once people unlock palpatine or bastilla, they are no longer relevant. 

So as soon as you finish your phoenix farms, switch to geos, Ahnald, one of the big SWGOH youtubers, just created a new account to test a new early game strategy where he is skipping phx altogether and starting w phx. And I agree with that strategy.

Biggest mistake that can be made in this game is over-investing. The trick is getting everything to just where you need it to be."
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,fei8qgd,t3_ep9owi,1579132792.0,"Phoenix squad and rebels are great for two things fleet wise:

1. Those ships are required to unlock the Chimera which is a great early capital ship (although Tarkin's is just as good early)
2. Those ships will work under a rebel fleet once you unlock the millenium Falcon with BH.

Problem is, rebel ships (other than phantom's or cassian's reinforcement) are meh until you get Mil. Falcon. Which means you will need other ships to compete in the immediate term. Also many rebel pilots are unworthy characters for big investment

Solution: Work on Geos, Geos are awesome early under Executrix and/or Chimera. Geo faction is great short term and long term so the investment in them is worth it. And late game you can still use their ships under the Malevolence when you eventually unlock that."
