LateStageCapitalism,fdmjn4f,t1_fdlhh4a,1578552337.0,They changed the last 3 from the original which was something like â€˜millions doing it imperfectly.â€™ Iâ€™m good with both versions.
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fdmjf1u,t3_em23k0,1578552091.0,ðŸ˜‚ Itâ€™s for a car you used to have but donâ€™t anymore or from watching a friendâ€™s cat.
AskReddit,fdmjcad,t1_fdm9o0j,1578552008.0,"So youâ€™re mad I answered the question of why depression and anxiety are on the rise. 

Is anything I said untrue? Nope. Everything is demonstrably provable. 

Is anything I listed *not* going to impact depression or anxiety? Nope. All of those stressors will contribute to or exacerbate mental health issues.

Did I make any of it personal to *my* life? Nope! You just assumed that because you didnâ€™t like my answer. 

Are you picking on everyone who sees the problems in the world or just the ones who Faux News tells you arenâ€™t real? Your reasons for complaining are as pathetic as your logic. Do the internet a favor and read a book by a real journalist."
FuckYouKaren,fdmivc1,t1_fdm8hoh,1578551506.0,I could not agree more. The number of celebrities scared to say â€˜vaccines are goodâ€™ is pathetic.
FuckYouKaren,fdm84zw,t1_fdm7hok,1578542164.0,She was a big celebrity name with the movement for a while. IDK how much any more but she is absolutely indirectly responsible for dead children.
FuckYouKaren,fdm47sj,t3_elzyej,1578539401.0,I despise her. She has the blood of dead children on her hands with her anti-vaxx BS
AskReddit,fdm3xoh,t1_fdlv180,1578539214.0,Cool! Not surprised about the rapper being a douche. Still disappointing though. Iâ€™ve heard some good tales about people who find a way to bug their code if they donâ€™t get paid. Get paid on time? Fix it and disappear. Donâ€™t get paid? Leave it and thereâ€™s a surprise in a few weeks

AskReddit,fdm3hzu,t1_fdlxfmw,1578538926.0,"Everything? Thatâ€™s impressive. I wasnâ€™t aware family, friends, romantic relationships, hobbies, and spiritual fulfillment were on my list of â€˜shit thatâ€™s wrongâ€™ since those things tend to dictate overall happiness.

Since youâ€™re so fucking smart, why donâ€™t you tell me how to fix everything Iâ€™ve listed? Offer solutions or cram your judgment in your cramming and STFU boomer."
