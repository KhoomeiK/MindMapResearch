So Microsoft already has a list of who has prototypes. They already know whose it really is. By adding this serial, isn't going to change that fact. If anything they are probably wondering how it worked internally.

The image is now a public image. Its out there. The control is gone.

This can be said for anybody of any color period.

And that's a nice lengthy response there (you wrote it because you think I'm attacking you... I'm not) But I am referring to this again:

>I flat out said I was gonna fight any and every white person I saw there

>don’t ask me what I consider to be white

So then who were you going to beat up exactly? For example, I am a Syrian/Sicilian. Not even 80 years ago my people were considered dogs, ""dagos"", wops and now terrorists. But too many because of my complexion, I am just ""white"". So someone who only knows the same pain am I considered apart of who you hate?

Just seems silly. While you have done tons of research about yourself, you should do just a little bit more it seems about others.

Also to this:
>Instead of being Irish or Polish or German or whatever, they were just white now

Actually that wasn't a thing until the late 60's. Especially for Sicilians, Italians, Irish and Germans. Polish people wasn't so much an issue up until that time."
