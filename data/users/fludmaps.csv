If you choose to spend your time in a mall, well, you've spent your time in a mall. Old town is beautiful, lots of cheap eats in Deira (and different Arab foods), there are lots of free beaches, and if you have time, RAK is great for hiking, Abu Dhabi for more history and culture, and Fujairah for snorkeling and such."

relationship_advice,fexrl2c,t1_fevg9fo,1579435074.0,"Yeah, I had a very similar issue. Your boyfriend needs to set boundaries with her because she is acting inappropriately. Make it clear that you don't care if they're friends but there is a line between what friends do and what people in romantic relationships do. If he can't respect that, then he's not respecting you. If he sets those boundaries and she keeps crossing them, he should enforce them--like if she's sending him cleavage pics why isn't he responding saying that's not cool? Just speaking from experience you might be chill now but don't let this fester because it WILL come out at some point. You are in the right."

But you told her that she has no say and then went ahead. That's not a good partnership. Idk how the fight went down exactly, but it sounds like you both need to communicate better. How is she supposed to know you won't just veto her opinion again in the future?

ETA: I say this as someone who has two cats and two dogs, and had to euthanize a pet in the past. It's not a unilateral decision, that's what it comes down to."

I've gained a lot of weight and totally get you, but there are some outfits where I knowww I'm working it. 

Also, communicate with the bf so he knows you're feeling this way and the decrease in sex is about this in particular. He could help you see things in a way that you can't right now."

AmItheAsshole,fe0yzbh,t3_endx8h,1578820553.0,"NAH. You have different preferences. I think you could have probably communicated it better to her, and she shouldn't make you feel bad for it. I think she likely lashed out because she felt embarassed that she was overly comfortable around you. Red flag comments seem a bit extreme to me tbh, people don't always act perfectly, especially in embarassing situations. 

If you like her and the relationship otherwise, you could communicate to her that you arent comfortable with that and it's just a boundary for you, that you want her to respect. Just like she needs to be the one to turn the water on, you need the bathroom door closed to feel comfortable.

And tbh the comments saying nobody wants to see that are missing the point. Some people are comfortable with that. The point is you brought something up in a less than ideal way (you could have just walked away and talked to her about it later), and she lashed out in a totally inappropriate way."
AmItheAsshole,fdtynnn,t3_emt2f6,1578724416.0,"I have bipolar and I'm struggling with losing weight so I feel like I'm in a good position to comment. When I get defeatist and just feel bad about my weight, I feel totally worthless, like it's just further proof of how awful I am. It stops being about the weight, for me, and becomes about my general self-image.

My bf does a great job of helping me out of that mindset by pointing out all the things that I've done really well lately, not necessarily just related to weight loss. Also if she's on meds mention that they can have a severe impact on weight gain and you're proud of her for all of the great things she has achieved. I usually stay a bit down for like a minute or two after that, but it starts to work almost instantly internally, where what he is saying combats my self perception and helps me think based on facts.

I think you need to ask her, gently, if she actually wants your support on this, and work together to find ways of addressing when she slips on her diet. Just fyi also I can take criticism. This might just be part of her personality.

But dude, just fyi that bipolar is not an excuse for any hurtful behavior. The way she thinks and feels can sometimes be warped by bipolar, but you shouldn't be walking on eggshells. Just make sure you take care of yourself first and that your needs are being met. You seem like a very understanding and giving partner. 

Also she should try Youper, it's a great app for managing different moods and helps me bring myself out of a down or mixed episode, and to track mood in general. Also check out the BipolarSO subreddit for support. Best of luck.

AmItheAsshole,fdtqn1s,t3_emyctk,1578720684.0,"YTA dude. I don't think it's okay that your mom is looking through your stuff, but why did you take it out on your sister? She's just trying to lose weight. Your mom set the no junk food rule, which she is allowed to do. You lashed out at probably the only person who isn't in the wrong here.

You seriously need to apologise to your sister. I've struggled with my weight my whole life and can tell you that she probably already hates her body and has felt the impact on her self esteem. You stooped pretty low with what you said to her. You should definitely talk to your mom about boundaries, but try to repair things with your sister first, and tell her you love and support her."

ABoringDystopia,fcwpml9,t1_fcur1kr,1578032773.0,"Not really, it's mostly dangerous for them and doesn't do anything. The most successful activists actually push to become shareholders in oil companies and lobby for change. BP and Shell are great examples of change being led from within."
ABoringDystopia,fcujvin,t1_fcujdzf,1577982666.0,"Maybe, but the protestors who are out there making headlines are mostly trying to disrupt production, like the ones who climbed onto a BP rig--an incredibly dangerous thing to do. And many don't really understand the industry, so they don't really understand why companies aren't immediately meeting their demands, and pin it on corporate greed. I used to be just like that myself. I still believe strongly in climate change, and in environmentalism, but there is a lot of misinformation out there."
ABoringDystopia,fcu7e0k,t1_fcu6yjo,1577974319.0,"Eh, I work with lots of oil and gas companies. The pressure from governments, shareholders, and the general public to become more sustainable is immense, and they're all making needed moves. The problem most people don't get is energy poverty is huge, and renewables need a baseload complement. That's part of the reason so many companies are leaning more heavily on gas (less carbon intensive and a far cleaner replacement for coal). And the energy industry is just so freaking huge and complex, it is incredibly hard to implement change in the timeframe that the public wants--which is immediate. They are making huge technological leaps to reduce their own carbon footprints and to create cleaner products, like Shell's hydrogen powered car concept and many CCUS trials which will capture CO2 out of the atmosphere."
ABoringDystopia,fcu6qbg,t1_fcu34l8,1577973881.0,"Yeah, but the solution isn't to demonize the entire industry or naively think it can be shut off overnight, it is to lobby for change within these organizations so they do business far more sustainably and are forced to move towards cleaner products. We do not have readily available alternatives for most of the products created thanks to the oil and gas industry. That is where we need to invest."
