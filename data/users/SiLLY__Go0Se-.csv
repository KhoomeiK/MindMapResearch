BattlefieldV,fdl493v,t1_fdl1t1j,1578516784.0,"If you don't believe me, I think you should gather some empirical data and compare turn rates with and without the perk. Regardless, if you're not utilizing out of plane maneuvering you're going to lose that fight. It's all a moot point anyways because of your plane isn't level 6, you just don't know what you're doing."
BattlefieldV,fdkz46z,t1_fdkwfpa,1578514144.0,"Control surfaces improves roll. That is something that is really only relevant when fighting a super competent pilot. You can still shoot down other planes, it's just not worth your time on a level 0 pacific plane."
BattlefieldV,fdix55t,t1_fdiwhtk,1578453048.0,"Tl;Dr ""the skill ceiling should be decided by people that don't understand the game"". I wasn't aware I was talking to a dev.

You're not gonna consistently get 90 kills in a tank by camping in the spawn. And from a pilots view, I can see a group of 3 infantry cluttered up. Of course I'm gonna drop there. Most inf players take really shitty routes to get where they're going, and don't utilize cover properly. Arras is a prime example of that. I see fox being taken. Ima strafe fox. Oh look, there's 4 inf players hugging the flagpole rather than the woodline that completely protects them from strafing and bombs. Weird when I get 3/4 

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"
BattlefieldV,fdiuvzw,t1_fdiswmi,1578451575.0,"I never said anything about realism. I asked why a bomb shouldn't kill infantry. We are at a middle ground, a typical game for me is 40 or 50-0. Higher kill games have more to do with both teams sucking just enough that the round is severely prolonged. Even pilots that are capable of doing so are extremely few and far between. Even if the norm dropped to 25-0, I would still get hatemail, and people would still bitch. I'll drop 90 in a tank, but that's totally fine. I have never gotten hatemail as a tanker. 

An ace pilot doesn't really care about strafing infantry, that's just something to do til the next dog fight. It seems like there's a constant trend of infantry players that refuse to broaden their skill sets and plateau at being average.

I have just shy of 1,000 hours of seat time in bfv, and I get killed constantly by flak/flieger from brand new players that were capable of leading a target. So I definitely feel the being punished for playing. Why even bother learning to maneuver when I can just laser a plane with a flak gun?

I feel for infantry players to some degree. It's not even about the death as it is the ego. For some reason, they view planes as untouchable. It's like getting repeatedly sniped by an amazing sniper, but you keep coming back over and over, running across an open field with an smg and you can't figure out why you keep getting shot on the 50 yard line. Pick up a sniper rifle, and learn to shoot back."
BattlefieldV,fdiq1wv,t1_fdiptmy,1578448481.0,"I'd agree one strafing tanks is simply op, but that only really applies to the pacific. As for the infantry, are you implying that a bomb shouldn't kill you?"

Anyways, I think the show Dexter hits a lot of sociopathic themes perfectly. But at the same token, I don't enjoy hurting animals so everybody is different."
BattlefieldV,fdiiwg3,t1_fdhhqk9,1578443926.0,"Imagine if a Boyes could slap a tank for 95 and still complaining. Why even learn to fly if some butthurt infantry player can just delete you out of the sky?

If you buff the ff, you're gonna get bombed endlessly. I'm just gonna stay in the stratosphere and farm. This is what happened days upon the ff release. I'd join several lobbies where planes would just ignore each other completely and bomb each other's team into oblivion.

The fliegerfaust makes everybody lose. Worst case scenario, you throw a fighter up at me, but I'll just have my own squad running ff and laser it down. They don't need to carry a panzerfaust/piat in because I can just destroy the tank from the air.

Flak is disgusting as it is. It will constantly decide dogfights and deny the entire map. I think you've never been good enough to have the enemy team bother getting in one against you."
BattlefieldV,fdii329,t1_fdhmxxs,1578443406.0,"This is simply incorrect. The only thing you truly need to be competitive in pub lobbies is an engine upgrade and a gun upgrade/fins so you can dps an enemy and go onto the next plane.

The original plane load outs were fairly irrelevant."

todayilearned,fcvzicb,t1_fcvytfq,1578013662.0,"The fact you've repeatedly called me a retard from the get go speaks a lot about your ""argument"". Whatever God or religion you believe in has literally as much merit to it as the flying spaghetti monster to me. I'm not going to debate it, because the very idea of God doesn't follow any scientific rules or reasons. If I quote the Bible, it'll be me just ""taking passages out of context"", or, ""that was a different time."" 

I'm just saying to leave God out of this because even *if* he has the power to do something about the shedding of innocent blood, he doesn't actually give a shit."
