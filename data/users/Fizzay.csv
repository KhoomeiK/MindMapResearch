NintendoSwitch,ffdnlot,t1_ffdkny5,1579824703.0,"Maybe if he already showed an interest in climbing mountains, like he is already showing anger issues.

Not taking care of this now just makes it worse. You seem pretty ignorant though, so there's not much of a point in arguing. Even if he doesn't become violent towards people, he needs a therapist if he gets so angry he starts breaking shit that costs hundreds of dollars. That is something that needs to be looked at, especially in a kid.

It really seems odd how intent you are to dismiss this as normal behavior. This is not normal behavior, nobody does this unless they have issues, and if it's normal to you, you may need help as well if this level of anger is normalized in your life. You don't need to be a professional to know this is an issue, you just have to be a professional to be able to treat it. You seem like one of those idiots who think mental health is not an issue... But it is. Especially for young people.  Normal people don't break their own stuff that costs hundreds of dollars. Normal people don't break any of their own stuff out of anger, regardless of price."

Credits are recognition of the people who worked on the game, who are you to speak on their behalf? Especially with the minimal effort required to do it. If anything, it's the principle of doing it, recognizing that these people helped create this game, regardless of how major their role was.

I have a friend who works for Gearbox and was in the credits for Borderlands 3, and she was really happy to be on there; she even got to put a quote at the end of the game thanking people in her life. Credits do matter to a lot of people, and you're acting like they all agree with you, when I know they don't.

I've seen plenty of criticism for this game, and I have criticisms of it as well, but some of those criticisms are often downvoted for being poor reasoning. You're overexaggerating the circlejerk. When a game is popular and receives as much critical acclaim as BotW did, people are going to talk about it and recommend it, especially on the subreddit dedicated to the console it is on. The problem with your comment is you are trying to act as if the game is objectively bad. The guy you responded to said the game was not for everyone, but you disagreed with him, as if that opinion is somehow wrong. You're trying to use your own opinions as an argument for why the game is objectively bad. Just because you don't see it as a masterpiece does not mean others didn't. And to ignore some of the groundbreaking things BotW did to the open world genre is a bit disingenuous. If you hate it that badly, don't participate in discussion about it. Nobody is forcing you, and there are criticisms of the game whether or not you're participating. You just seem to want validation for your own opinion."

NintendoSwitch,ff5oihx,t1_ff5mdw4,1579603325.0,"It's not a circlejerk, it's people expressing their honest opinions of the game. Not everything has to have mixed reviews. People love the gameplay, and for some people, that's enough.

Also, trying to frame a popular consensus as circlejerking is really disingenuous.. It's less to do with your opinion (because it is an opinion) and more on how you express it. A lot of people outside this subreddit love it too; it won multiple game of the decade awards. To pretend like it's just a vocal minority who likes this game is ridiculous when it still sells incredibly well nearly 3 years later, and loved by many people, not a single subreddit. You're being incredibly disingenuous. You're just flat out trying to deceive people by implying the game is only being pushed by a small group of people. Express your opinion, but don't try so hard to influence others to feel the same way, and try to discredit the opinion's of others because they oppose yours.

And don't even try acting like some martyr because you're getting downvoted on account of a circlejerk. You're going to receive criticism and downvotes because your argument is a horrible one that is just trying to push your own opinions onto others, and trying to blame the game's success and popularity on a subreddit of \~1 million, while being insulting to anyone who did enjoy the game.
