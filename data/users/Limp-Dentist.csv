writing,fcv8toi,t1_fcv73dt,1577997039.0,"How close to a gender stereotype do you want your character to be? Write the story first. If your story is compelling, gender-related questions will answer themselves along the way. Worst case scenario: you end up with a story which contains a character that is unbelievable because his/her actions do not align with readers' expectations of his/her gender. What then? Edit. Re-write."
writing,fcv845i,t1_fcv7lmx,1577996617.0,Go for it. Don't try to overthink these issues before you start. Jump in head first. Write it. Get it written. Then step back and see what you've done. Then you will have a point of reference from which to guide yourself.
writing,fcv7813,t3_eiww6y,1577996082.0,Consider crafting the story in such a way that the character's gender is never defined. This may give your story a cutting edge you never knew was possible.
writing,fcv6y53,t3_eirnrf,1577995918.0,"Whether he's a total dick or a cruel-to-be-kind genius should be of little interest to you. I have to agree with some of his points though. If you're a writer, then bloody well get on with it. How is this discussion helping you to succeed? It's not."
writing,fcv63xv,t1_fcv2419,1577995421.0,"Just stop allowing gender to get in the way. Stop it. If you don't, then your characters (and ultimately your stories) will fail to be human. Ask yourself what your characters truly desire. Then ask yourself to what degree do your characters actually know what they truly desire. Then ask yourself what is preventing them from fulfilling their desires, or what is preventing them from knowing or understanding what they desire. Nuances of gender, if they transpire to be of relevance to the aforementioned factors, will naturally fall into focus. What I fear is that you may be choking your creativity by dwelling too much on what male/female characters 'should' be. Write the bloody story first. If you end up creating a character that's unbelievable because they do not conform to the readers' expectations of gender norms, then you may actually have created a character that's worth reading about. Try to avoid cookie-cutter character creations. They're almost certainly gonna turn out to be two-dimensional. Make sense?"
writing,fcv3jsv,t1_fcv1faj,1577993914.0,"fair comment. i dunno - sounds flaky, though, doesn't it? depending on the details, wouldn't it be better to have this character witness the murder and react how she reacts and reveal why later on? The current 'sensation' Joker (the film with Wackhim Feenix) is only fascinating to audiences because they know what later becomes of the character. I find it tiresome when people attempt to justify their point before they make the point. It's better when they make the point first and justify it later. I'm curious, in any case, to see what this visionary writer has to offer."

writing,fcuzhgd,t3_ej1slf,1577991601.0,There are no rules. Great works were not created by following a formula. The question you should ask yourself is: Is this story worth telling?
bipolar,fcuz44c,t3_eiwta4,1577991394.0,"The sketch is super. The nails are absolutely fabulous, darling"
bipolar,fcuypk3,t3_eix8rd,1577991172.0,That is incredible. There's no need for you to be nervous about sharing your art.
writing,fcuyedw,t3_eiywwe,1577991003.0,"We are making such a silly mistake when we dwell on gender like this. Character is not defined by gender, it's defined by character. Don't be a man who is writing from a female perspective - or vice versa. That's bullshit. Be the character. If you can't do that, then stop writing. There's already an abundance of awful writing in existence. Please don't contribute to it."

cardmagic,fcrmlmy,t1_fcr453t,1577903783.0,"Yeah, that's really good. I've been (on and off) practicing it for about a year, and mine isn't good enough to really perform unless I'm in a dimly-lit bar and I know the spectators have had a few beers haha. I'm really keen on the Herman pass recently - been practicing for a month or two and already feel I can pull it off better than the classic pass. Perseverance is key though, I guess. Alex Pandrea reckons you need like three years to nail the classic pass. gulp. BTW, nice cards, too."
cardmagic,fcrl5rt,t1_f6vhsiw,1577903242.0,"I'm kinda losing my will to continue with the classic pass, too. I've been practicing (maybe not enough) for about a year, and it's flashing all over the place still. Shame though, coz when it's good, it's really good. I'm gonna feel a bit ashamed of myself to not continue. Anyway, much more recently learnt the Herman pass, and I find it much easier to make the pass smoothly and invisibly. I'm gonna check out your suggestions - squeeze shift and straddle pass. Cheers"
