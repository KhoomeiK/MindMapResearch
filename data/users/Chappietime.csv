Hammers,ffge83d,t1_ffesk80,1579904265.0,"Just by way of explanation, I was initially confused by the leap year and for some reason was thinking Jan 29 and feb 1 were consecutive days.  Obviously I’m an idiot for that.  

But under those circumstances, a forfeit would make sense in that we are never beating Liverpool and we can beat Brighton but not when everyone has played the day before.  Follow my logic:

After posting, I realized my mistake, but it got me thinking.  If you could forfeit games with the caveat that you lost some specified goal differential, what would be the best course for the season?

I haven’t seen the betting line, but I’d not be surprised to see that we were 3 goal underdogs vs. Liverpool.  So in that case, a forfeit with a -3 goal penalty would be somewhere near break even. Given that, you’d have to strongly consider a -2 goal penalty, and I think if they let us forfeit at -1, it would be a no-brainer.  

Obviously this is never happening, but just academically, it’s fun to think about.  The way things are going, goal differential may well be the difference in staying up or going down. So given the advantages of resting players, forgoing injuries, and losing some number of goals less than 3, I feel like a forfeit makes a lot of sense."

Hammers,ffdqn3f,t3_et0gnl,1579826595.0,"I fully plan to watch but here’s my question:

Am I reading it right that we play Liverpool and then Brighton on consecutive days?

I’m no quitter, but if this is correct, we clearly need to forfeit the Liverpool game so we can actually have a chance at points we can realistically get.  

I’m sure it’s not allowed since goal differential is a thing, but if they offered me a loss and -3 goals for not having to play I’d take it.


Edit: thankfully I was reading it wrong.  Still I think I’d be tempted to take -3 if they let us forfeit."

Hammers,ffcfbio,t1_ffce0r4,1579798233.0,"I assigned an expected value on each game from 0 points to 2 points based on my best guess.

AskReddit,fevkikp,t3_eqies2,1579398473.0,"Story 1

I’m an air ambulance pilot on a 8 passenger turbo prop.  I had just unloaded a patient and crew, and was straightening up the plane and working on paperwork before the next crew arrived.  It was the night shift...

I’m walking to the front of the plane when I hear someone yell “Heyyy!”, and at the same time the plane moves enough to cause me to lose my balance.  

My first thought was “holy shit, the ambulance got here early and they backed into the plane,” figuring that the person yelling was trying to get them to stop. 

I run to the back of the plane where the door is, and stick my head out.  The ramp is completely empty. Like I said, it’s the night shift, so this is probably 2 in the morning.  There wasn’t anyone for half a mile in any direction. 

My wife thinks I had a stroke.  

Story 2

I also fly a Lear-45. It can go really, really high.  One night we were at 47,000 feet, an altitude that few non-military planes operate at with any regularity.  

We were cruising along normally when I saw a set of blinking lights that appeared to be at least a few thousand feet above us.  I didn’t see anything on TCAS (our sort of traffic radar), and my co-pilot got curious.  

He called ATC, and asked if they knew what was above us.  The reply -

“I don’t have anything in this sector higher than you.  Uh, do you want to report something?”
