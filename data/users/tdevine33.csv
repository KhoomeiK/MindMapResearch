Their phones are great overall, except for all the bloatware they pile on that you cant remove. I wish there was an option to buy Samsung hardware that's totally clean of all their shitty first party software!

Show me *one* research paper that says weed ""ruins your brain"". Yes there are negative side effects, but ""ruins your brain"" is about as unscientific as you can state it.
