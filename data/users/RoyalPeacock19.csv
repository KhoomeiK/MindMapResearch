# The word Caucasian should only be used to refer to people from the Caucuses

Basically the title, the word Caucasian describes people from the Caucuses region, made up of all of Armenia, Georgian, and Azerbaijan, and some of Russia and Iran. Using it as a catch all term for white people is not only wrong, as many people who are white don’t have their defining ancestry from the Caucuses region (namely Jews, Finns, and Hungarians), and the term is less descriptive than just using white.

Christian,ffw2rjc,t3_evicoh,1580281828.0,"We are to strive for perfection, but we all fall short. That said, there are many, many, MANY people who call themselves Christians in the States, Canada, Europe, and elsewhere that are not. The best way we can tell is by their deeds, which are endemic of true Christianity. The Bible does say that there will be many antichrists, and that many will come to him saying that they followed him, but he will say that he never knew them. I pray for anybody the Lord wills, and they choose to come to Christ, but a far most of both the non Christian and nominally Christian will never truly come to follow him."

Sunstags

Giant, flaming immortal deer with a set of feathered wings, these creatures are said to pull Solis in his chariot across the sky. If you injure one, you may provoke the wrath of Solis himself.

Erebosians

Giant creatures that stand up to 36m tall, these monsters have 12 geese heads/necks attached to the body of a Timberwolf. With two sets of wings, these creatures are covered in steel or iron feathers. The job of these creatures is to guard the Immortal Wall in the Underworld, to keep the Vices from fleeing their captivity in the Vicelands. Often they can be found wandering, either being too young to guard the wall, or having gone rouge and set off to terrorize the local populace.

They then went to influence us, and did and have done all sorts of bad things. In short, they have all already made their choice. Ultimately, the sacrifice that allows us into Gods presence, Jesus’ death, was a sacrifice for humanity.

When talking about the Satan himself, the Bible in Revelation says he will be thrown in the Lake of Fire for eternity. It also talks about judgement for the Angels, which likely refers to the demons (I haven’t looked into the original wording)."
