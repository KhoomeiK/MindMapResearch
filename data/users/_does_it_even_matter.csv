Constant abuse fucks with your psyche, to the point they start interpreting instances of abuse as acts of love. I've seen it in countless women, and a surprisingly large number of men, too. Take my mother, for example. Her dad was very abusive, and she got used to the idea that men who love you get violent, so when my dad started hitting her she excused it as something men just did, she became very sexist, and when she finally left him, she saw no reason to discontinue dating a toxic or violent man, because she thought all men were like that. Men who wouldn't do these things made her suspicious, because if a person seems too good to be true at first, the person is going to get incredibly toxic and you won't realize it until it's almost impossible to get out.

Seriously, wtf? Why is it okay that people talk about my demographic like we're shallow, conceited assholes, but the second I mention that middle aged white men tend to be creepy around me *I'm* the one whose suddenly biased?  

Also, I find it very telling that the bias against me is that *I* am biased against people that I perceive as ""unattractive"" for just being friendly/whatever; when in reality, my experience is that many men have a habit of flirting aggressively, and ignoring any signs that I'm *not* interested, until I have to be a dick to get them to go away. And it's *not* limited to unattractive people, ""cute"" guys do it too, but they seem to forget very soon, full of confidence and sure at some point they will get the pussy. Guys that think nobody is attracted to them (which is statistically unlikely) seem to hold onto it and let it feed their self-loathing.

And sure, I might be prone to making assumptions that someone is flirting when they're just being friendly, but it's not unprovoked, and it's not limited to ""ugly"" people, it's everyone, and, mostly, it's middle aged men. I look even younger than I am, and I haven't had a *single* job where I wasn't fighting off sexual advances from men nearly twice my age (usually white) on a near-daily basis. Most of them came back repeatedly, and it honestly scares me how aggressively I've been pursued before, and I don't appreciate sexual advances at work, **period**. It's terrifying, and it adds fear of losing my job for complaining or for them getting angry and telling lies about me, and fear of being stalked at work/followed home to the already existing fear of being sexually assaulted."

When significant portions of the population do little things like talk shit about and avoid those who aren't Christian, and even pass laws based entirely on a Christian perspective and not a moral one, (laws against alcohol sales on Sundays or gambling for example) every display of Christianity just reminds people that they are not considered ""equal"" to the majority, and that they will always be outsiders, allowed, but never really accepted into society.

Put plainly, I think there is a way to prevent anti-vaccers dangerous misconceptions from harming anyone but themselves, while still maintaining everyone's right to make their own health decisions, also making it very clear exactly where the government and the rest of society stand on the issue. 

Don't want to vaccinate? Fine, you don't *have* to, but you can't send your child to school, (you'll have to home-school, ) or government funded or subsidized day-care, and health facilities designed to serve the very old, very young, and those very likely immunocompromised (like pediatricians offices, nursing homes, cancer treatment centers) have the right to send un-vaccinated to a designated part of the building, (and, in cases where it doesn't put their own health at risk, bar them from entry) where any diseases they may carry won't put someone at risk. Refusing to leave or sneaking in an un-vaccinated child is probably punished like ""reckless endangerment,"" punishable by... I don't know for sure, a fine of 10%(give or take) of your average income for two weeks, and maybe... up to 2 months in county jail?

Sure, *technically* it's now a computer operating a function that serves the same purpose as a phone and then some, but the fundamentals of what makes a phone a phone are still there, you pick it up, dial 9-7 digits, and you can speak to a person almost instantly from very far away, there's just extra bells and whistles. Besides, a computer is navigating the connection between your flip phone and the cell towers on both ends, too. So my smartphone is no *less* of a phone than yours. Mine just also has a sophisticated computer inside of it as well, and language is the kind of thing that's allowed to evolve, and words can mean different, new, or multiple things and there doesn't have to be anything wrong with that. Just because a cfl isn't made of the same chemical as old lightbulbs and has a computer chip in it doesn't make it any less of a lightbulb. The word gay means ""a man who is only attracted to men"" more than it does ""happy"" now, and that's not necessarily a bad thing, it still means ""happy"" in some context, and there's ways to distinguish between the two meanings.

That's not fair. Social security excess for any year *was* invested back into other gov't programs, but they actually see a tidy profit in interest of these debts, and the problem is actually that they're having to actually cash in whole sums on debts that were a major part of their income, meaning that interest won't be there for next year's budget. Cost of living is going up, the largest generation is retiring, and people are living longer than they used to. Social security was and is very successful. The only problem with it is that society's needs have changed, which is entirely normal, they just need to account for that change.


>food stamps how ever need an over hull when I was working in guam for example

Guam? As in the country? I thought we were talking about American politics, and, while no system is perfect, American food stamps works pretty well. Sure, there's not always enough money to go around, and maybe a few people take advantage of it, but I was on food stamps growing up, and I can tell you its not always how it looks. Looking at the way I dress, you'd think I had money, designer bag, designer t-shirts, expensive jeans, proud walk. My boyfriend drives a pretty nice Volkswagen. In reality I'm dirt poor, *everything* I own was gifted to me and I'm incredibly lucky they fit well, and he got a damn good deal on that car because it has some pretty annoying electrical trouble, but runs really well, just annoying to have to climb through the backseat to open the door on occasion. And while I was on food stamps as a teen someone sure did see my family and order $150 worth of fresh seafood for a party, but what they didn't see was that we ate pb&j and ramen for months to save up enough foodstamps to buy that, and it was half a month's food budget for my grandparents, my mom, me, and my very picky little brother. We didn't deserve to be judged for sacrificing to give our friends and family a treat.

>higher education shouldnt cost what it does

No, but that's not the purpose of a Pell Grant is it?  A Pell Grant is there so that (even if tuitions was as affordable as it could be) children who could not afford tuition wouldn't be prevented from getting higher education. The skyrocketing cost of tuition is another matter, and ought to be addressed outside of discussing Pell Grants, because they are successful at what they were meant to do. My cousin graduated without a penny of debt, and is paying pretty large sums into the tax system, all thanks to the Pell Grant program. 

You asked me to name off some government programs that actually worked for the purpose they were intended, and I even managed to find one that didn't just *save* but *made* the government money. And then you tell me all these problems mostly just related to these programs and I just want to tell you one thing my grandma always told me: ""don't throw the baby out with the bathwater,"" in other words, don't ruin (or overlook) a good thing just because it's surrounded by shit."

Of course it's fair that small business owners don't have to provide insurance, and it's kind of unfair to expect any business to do so for people they see 2 times a week, that's an unfair financial burden. However I feel that a lot of businesses abuse the system. Having more part-time employees than full-time employees for the sole reason that you don't have to provide benefits. Those that work for small business owners and the self-employed are the gaps that Obamacare was supposed to cover, but it wasn't functional Nationwide. People shouldn't be punished for working for a small business, there's enough challenges facing everyone in that sector already.

I don't think Obamacare was ever supposed to give businesses the freedom to dodge their responsibilities. Aside from the lack of healthcare, sick leave, maternity leave, or retirement, having two jobs, even if you're still only doing 40 hours is incredibly taxing, and I get that sometimes you need another hand, but don't have enough work for a full time job, so there's always going to be some people with two jobs or only a part time job, but there's no good reason for *so many people* to be put in that position."

Social security- until recently it was a very successful program, and the only reason why it's failing now is because the needs and situation of the American people has changed.

Food stamps has saved countless children from starvation.

WIC- improved the health and financial burden of a healthy diet for thousands of children and pregnant women.

Pell Grants- provided access to higher education to countless people who wouldn't have been able to afford it otherwise, improving our economy, and therefore making the government money, and increasing quality of life for millions

>Making other countries pay their fair share in NATO/UN

I mean, while he deserves some credit for lighting a fire under their asses about it, he didn't actually do anything except call attention to it all. After Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 NATO members pledged to increase their defense spending to at least 2% of their GDP by 2024. Only 9 have done so, but all but a few have been increasing their budgets, probably not fast enough, but nothing in politics ever goes fast enough.

>Boosted the economy by his policies of deregulation and lowering corporate taxes to bring jobs back, like with a magic wand

Did he though? Because most policies (especially the ones that apply to the financial sector) presidents pass either don't take effect or the real results of them aren't apparent until that presidential term has ended. Let me be clear, I'm saying he's taking credit for improvements made by Obama after the '08 recession. I'm not saying he's tanking the economy, I'm saying that wether or not his influence is positive remains to be seen. I don't have *horrible* expectations there, but I also expect him to give just a little bit too much preference to businesses and not enough to individuals. I would prefer a president that would break up the ""too big to fail"" model, instead of encouraging it.
