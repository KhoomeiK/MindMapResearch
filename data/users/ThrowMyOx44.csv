SuicideWatch,fdbsjzu,t1_fdb5ep6,1578261325.0,"Thanks for reminding me to listen to The Smiths' 'How soon is now'.. it makes me cry, thinking this is sort of me & my girlfriend's song. I hope we all find a way :) you should talk with your parents and see what you can do."
SuicideWatch,fdbr52n,t3_ekgwve,1578260626.0,"Just beware that you can't really OD on shrooms or acid. That said, you will experience such a clusterfuck of a psychedelic experience that you might just find another path in life, lol. Hope for the best :)"
SuicideWatch,fdbq534,t1_fdb3urk,1578260253.0,"The last parts make me cry, of surrendering to your family..

I also sympathize with OP's post. My name initial is also A, and I fear the same transformation he experienced, although from different illnesses.

Ketamine could really be of use and I hope OP tries it."
SuicideWatch,fdazk7f,t3_ekhawn,1578252071.0,"Haha, you sound sorta like me. I am terrified of life and of everything as well, plus cognitive and general mental dysfunctionality to top it off.

Pro tip: SSRIs get you kinda rid of that 'terrified' feeling, but there's still a shitload of other factors that make us feel unprepared."
SuicideWatch,fdawwzu,t3_ekesc8,1578251338.0,"Funny how one of the symptoms of the usual dysfunctionality in life is also present in our attempts at death. I keep postponing my supposed death as well, just like with everything else. It's not a concrete thing that I'll do now; it's some ethereal goal in the sorta-near future, but towards which I take no steps in acheiving. So tired of the back-and-forth."
SuicideWatch,fd9h1z7,t1_fd9cdmb,1578233225.0,"I feel exactly the same, and I'm at my wit's end. I was already barely functional and struggling to get by with my mental illnesses, but now that I have internalized suicide as a constant option, I am completely retarded and depressed. It's either a life full of constant mental torture and disappointment ahead, or simply going to sleep and be done with it. Best of luck to you my friend <3"
SuicideWatch,fd961gb,t3_ekcks2,1578228931.0,"This is what I want to know as well.. but honestly I don't know if there's a way. One of the things I have said to other grieving friends about a common friend who had passed away, is that he would wish us to be happy, and not cry for him. Of course, close family members will never be the same again.. they just can't ever recover fully if they care about the person; only partially over the long-term."
SuicideWatch,fd93zgv,t1_fd931k5,1578228078.0,"That's kinda the only thought that keeps me alive, for now; it's bloody horrible.. The other one being the natural reluctance/hesitation that comes with thinking about death, but if I didn't have my mom & brother.. I'd still hesitate, god damn this back-and-forth."
SuicideWatch,fd6gy0u,t1_fd5dvqt,1578190851.0,"Thank you a lot, for your concern and willingness to help.. <3 I deeply appreciate it.. in a way, until my depressive and dissociative states take over and I become someone else. It's really getting unliveable, and I know it'll be like this for the rest of my life.. I just really don't see a way out. My heart goes out to you, and also your interest in psychology is appreciated."
SuicideWatch,fcze681,t1_fcz0p2m,1578099171.0,"Thank you for the concern <3 I appreciate. I have looked into mostly everything. I should be graduating in Psychology this year and have always been interested in the neurobiological side. I don't want to say that I'm an expert, but many experts will also confirm the fact that once you're born & developed a certain way, it's very hard or even impossible to change some aspects of your thinking or your personality. Mine is unfortunately too clusterfucked to be able to be changed. Even genetic editing with Crispr9, which is cutting edge, would hardly be able to make a meaningful difference in an already developed brain.

Cheers, and thank you :) I am happy now, that I talked to my girlfriend which I love. But it's bittersweet, and I'd rather not tell the rest of the story. She loves me but I'm too incapable of dealing with life due to my illnesses. I wish I could at least die right now, while still happy."
SuicideWatch,fcyjtqr,t1_fcyhuxb,1578081281.0,How did you survive though? That's.. kinda impossible.
SuicideWatch,fcyjlwg,t1_fcwnn1s,1578081163.0,"I guess I might share some features, but regardless, all individuals are unique due to the complexity of the brain. Which is why the NIMH made a fuss about DSM's categorial approach and is trying to move to a more dimensional one. Still though, it's quite clear you can't un-retard someone or cure schizophrenia or bipolar."
SuicideWatch,fcw3m6k,t1_fcvy4xx,1578016372.0,What drugs did you OD on though?
SuicideWatch,fcw22eq,t3_ej5mz0,1578015347.0,I'm sorry you're going through this. I hope we all make it out :d
SuicideWatch,fcu4rdj,t1_fctdoez,1577972526.0,"I think we should honestly give ourselves in for research. It's probably not autism because we're not stuck inside our own heads fully, but it definitely is something curious.

Can you yourself talk easily to people if you're somewhere social? Or are you quiet most of the time because words & thoughts are very hard to come up with (almost impossibly so)?"
