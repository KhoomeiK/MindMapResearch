Drag also changes all the time, look at Season 1 and 2 as compared to season 10 and 11, so it's not just one static thing all the time."

The same is to be said for painting, padding and dressing a feminine body to appear masculine.  I would love to learn more about how bio queens and drag kings perform their art, because I do believe it is art, and I think it deserves it's own platform rather than being shoved into a show that has focused on one type of drag for 12 seasons."

In a way, I agree that bio queens, drag kings, etc, aren't appropriate for Drag Race because it's a different skill set, and they deserve their own spin off to show case their style of drag.

Unfortunately, she is like a lot of the cosplayers I follow, very creative but a bit limited in the personality department outside of pretending to be a cartoon character."

They didn't even bother to mention she is Violets drag mother. 

It's not a bad thing, some queens who have placed high or even won are less ""polished"" than early exiting queens, because they made good TV."
