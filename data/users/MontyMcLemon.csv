EDAnonymous,fcwqkye,t3_ejaz48,1578033740.0,"Yay I can contribute! A tablespoon or two of trader joes soyaki and any frozen stir fry veggie mix. You can add cubes of tofu if you’re feeling fancy or just want some protein. It’s super easy, just put the veggies in a pan on the highest temperature and stir fry until almost all the way hot, then add the soyaki and tofu until all of it is cooked and the sauce thickens a little. It’s very easy to make and pretty satisfying. Costco has some great stir fry veggie mix."
EDAnonymous,fcmje0c,t3_ehtn50,1577777681.0,"I took Prozac for a while and it helped my pms/depression a ton but killed sex drive and function. Wellbutrin was alright. It made me feel kind of shaky sometimes. I had to stop taking it because of how restless I was. I think there are better anti depressants out there, at least for me. I’m off of them now because the side effects made me depressed in a whole different way. Like I wasn’t wanting to die all the time but I felt flawed and messed up because of the physical side effects, the emotional numbing, and feeling dependent on them. That being said, medications work different of everyone. A doctor’s opinion is worth 100x more than mine though. And there’s so many options now."
SuicideWatch,fcjqn2a,t1_fcjpyy3,1577699725.0,"I wanted to add, you can ask your doctor for antipsychotics. They’re a strong medication, but can seriously control mood. They may work very well for your situation."
SuicideWatch,fcjpyy3,t3_ehjx7m,1577698760.0,"You are not a psychopath. You are a strong, loving human who has likely been very hurt in the past. That’s why you’re posting about it. Because you care and are concerned for yourself and the wellbeing of those around you. If I were you, I would talk to my psychiatrist about these urges. It’s possible the meds you are on are also causing impulsive actions. Something I heard someone say once is that depression is anger towards inwards. That always stuck with me. You are a good person inside. You are going through tough issues. If you can, find a person who can sort of foster your cat for a while until you feel a better sense of comfort within yourself. It may make you more comfortable to know that your cat in safe and in good hands.

There is goodness in this world and you will reach a better place one day. Please believe in yourself. You are a good person. You are strong."
SuicideWatch,fcjo0yc,t1_fcjn6vy,1577695989.0,"Nihilist indeed. I’m often inclined to think we join them, try and fail, or end ourselves instead of giving in. It does feel like an endless maze until we realize we are trapped. That’s when it hits the fan."
SuicideWatch,fcjnlan,t3_ehhy76,1577695380.0,"I don’t agree that it’s selfish. I heard that a lot when I first was starting to go through mental health problems. I started to find out a lot of people actually don’t think it’s selfish. There’s a lot of good people that genuinely want to see others live, thrive, and be happy. But the same people also acknowledge that suicide is... like a very strong calling. And that there is really no blame to give. It’s just a hopeless feeling to be in that position for both sides. I’m sending you good wishes and hope you have a safe night/day."

EDAnonymous,fc169wy,t3_eflz5m,1577309464.0,Relatable. That was my excuse for years and no one blinked an eye too.
EDAnonymous,fc159rt,t3_efa523,1577308644.0,"For me I gain a ton up to 8 lbs sometimes before my period, than when my period hits I gradually start losing it all again within a couple days. Sending warm wishes."
EDAnonymous,fbz33f6,t3_ef5ib3,1577233618.0,"I’m sorry you’re going through this. I binged today too. The only thing that helps my bloating from binging is to lower intake of salt to almost nothing for a few days or just fast... Take care of yourself the best your mind allows, the holidays are a huge trigger for so many of us. I believe in you!"
