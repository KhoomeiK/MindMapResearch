Of course it's always unfortunate when the zeitgeist evolves into a irrational direction, but it only becomes a massive problem when it is not possible anymore to expose the irrationality. You seem to assume that science is always right and that some infallible authoritative instance would be able to guarantee this. But this is not how science works. It's in the nature of science that it must be possible to challenge established perceptions. Who would you want to give the authority to to decide what is correct science and what is not? How do you make sure that this authority will be infallible?

So you would say it's likely that the women that rejected these men failed to see what great men they were?

Doesn't seem like that hard of a concept, really.

I also didn't say that women are required to choose these men but I think that it's possible that many men that would make good partners and husbands don't receive any romantic attention from women they like while other men who may or may not be just as good are much more preferred due to some rather superficial traits or attributes.

The irony is that the women that gravitate towards assholes obviously also get to know a lot more assholes and then get the impression that all men are assholes and that those who can't even find a woman must be the worst because these women are of course convinced that they had already decided for the better men in the past.

Ironically it's in response to a incel voicing hostile thoughts against his male competition, not against women. Did the racist southerners also fancy to kill the slave owners because they had what they themselves couldn't get?

The problem is that men are expected to just have what it takes or to disappear and die alone. They don't really have the option to try and fail a few times in order to learn because every clumsy failed attempt is already seen as creepy or even rapey and at least as a reason to ridicule them. It's not like women would honestly tell them what they should do better or that it would be socially acceptable to teach men how to get a woman to like them because that would be pathetic (PUA anyone?). The irony is that many of the incels simply have too much internalized feminist nonsense, which made them see women as something magical who they need to treat totally different than their male buddies. Anonymously on the internet they talk shit to express their frustration but in the real world they are intimidated by women like a deer kitten in the headlights but they still believe that they should be super popular among women because they are willing to try to be what feminism has taught them what women allegedly want which only makes them fail even more.

It's no surprise that there are also a number of awful people among the incels but it's absurd to assume that they all see women as their property.

One problem I have increasingly noticed is misquoted sources. This may happen by accident or intentionally. It could happen when the summary of the source has been rephrased multiple times by different people but although the source reference was kept it doesn't support the rephrased text in the article anymore. But there are also clear examples when texts were added with sources that don't support the text at all. Many readers seem to think, a piece of text must be credible if it has a source reference and are thus less likely to challenge it but don't check the source itself. This is especially difficult when the source is not available online or has disappeared in the meantime.

The other big issue is omission of additional or contradicting information and a general lack of context. This is also true for a lot of main stream media articles that try to spin something without having to lie. Context is often very important and it's omission can completely change how the remaining facts are perceived. An obvious example would be a murder case that turns out as an act of self defense with sufficient context information.

news,fd50qdh,t1_fd3qm2p,1578173028.0,"There are multiple Overton windows because every ideology bubble maintains it's own and they have drifted apart. So much that when we look out of our bubble into another bubble, almost nothing they say seems to make any sense to us. Our mind is playing us a trick as it makes us believe we and the people that agree with us could be the only ones that are not in a bubble, that *we* know what's *actually* true. This way we are able to believe that although we may not be the smartest in general we certainly have figured out that they are all wrong and our perception of the world is much more accurate then theirs. This leads to a certain sense of entitlement and arrogance and we believe that they must all be stupid or at least need to be educated while we ourselves are relatively fine already in comparison. Even when we have the chance to talk with each other, we only try to make each other finally understand that they are completely wrong or we simply consider them not worth our time to even talk to them.

Why did this happen? I guess social media has helped to let the bubbles drift apart more and more. Social media algorithms filter the media and opinions we consume so that we mostly get to see stuff that already agrees with us, exaggerates our own misconceptions even more and twists everything that happens in the world to make it support our ideology. In the age of social media everyone can get a completely different impression of the world from that of their neighbor."

When a state pays for the education of a soldier, is the soldier obliged to kill strangers for whatever cause that state may come up with?

It's hardly avoidable that propaganda will lead to false expectations about the validity of a war but when soldiers realize they were lied to, shouldn't they have the option to quit fighting and go home without severe personal repercussions? [Why not?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tixOyiR8B-8) Why do we still try to persuade ourselves that we are a democracy and can't possibly be the baddies when we don't even afford our soldiers the right to refuse to act against their conscience?"
MurderedByWords,fd1xoac,t1_fd0zqmz,1578138438.0,"Do you also afford that same empathy to the Nazi soldiers that fought for Hitler? They were also lied to and had seemingly valid reasons to become soldiers, i.e. that is was illegal not to enlist.

What responsibilities does the population have to stop their own country from starting wars when they realize these wars would be wrong? Soldiers fighting for the wrong causes are necessary tools that create suffering that wouldn't have been possible if they had not complied.

Imagine there is war and nobody shows up.

I know that this is not feasible but to me it also seems wrong to generally absolve soldiers from all guilt for the destruction that they have been part of. Is student debt really a good enough excuse for killing people on the other side of the globe? Ok, they were lied to but shouldn't they have been able to get better informed before they make such a decision?"
politics,fd1t3x0,t3_ejuycz,1578136392.0,"From the article:
> The one constant over the past forty years of Iran-US relations has been Washington’s deep desire for regime change in Tehran. Seen in that light, the administration’s refusal to create an off-ramp to deescalate this entirely US-made crisis may be deliberate — part of a plan to punish the Iranian people so severely that they eventually rise up and topple their government on Washington’s behalf.

ITT: It's not the US, it's Trump's fault, he is uniquely bad!

If Trump's legacy could at least be that him being awful finally helps us realize that the US might be the aggressor in the conflicts it creates. But we won't let that happen, we rather blame Trump personally, even though his policy is mostly a continuation of the aggressive US foreign policy of the last decades."

The trick is always the same: The media constantly shows us especially bad examples of either side. Now the magic happens in our head: If this makes *them* look bad, we are willing to generalize and see it as proof how bad they are. But if it's an absurd exaggeration of our own ideology, we are willing to ignore it as an untypical exception because we know that most on our side are much more reasonable.

This way we willfully become part of one of two hate mobs which are both afraid of an exaggerated unrealistic image of each other and are both convinced that the others are evil and stupid and that it would be a waste of time to even talk to them. Social media algorithms help us to filter the media, so that we only get to see the content with enough spin to support our own fears and anger which makes us stubbornly convinced that we are right and they are dangerous."
