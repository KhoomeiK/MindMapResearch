I just worked for 3 years, lived frugal, saved my money, then retired at 24 in the philippines.

Havent worked a day in 7 years now, I've bought a couple condos and am renting them out, the cost of living here is so low that the passive income is enough to cover my expenses plus get some savings for hm ... second retirement? I don't know exactly what I'm saving for. But I don't want to waste my money and have to work again, it's a better safe than sorry tactic.

Well I will never be able to afford a porsche or yacht this way, but I really don't care about possessing a porsche or yacht anyway, I just want a comfortable life with lots of free time.

---

To be fair I have a college degree in a STEM field but like pretty much everybody else with a STEM degree I went into IT since the pay is a lot higher.

I started on 3.5k a month before taxes, and switched a couple times after projects and my last paycheck was about 5k. Not a big increase but noticeable. I was living with roommates and had only a 24 m2 room for myself. When I went out for drinks I brought a flask, so I could get by with one or two beers. Took a bycicle to work everyday, which I bought for 20$, it was total junk but you could ride it, my tubes had 4 patches at the end because I refused to spend 10$ on a new one when the bycicle was only 20$. I logged everything I spent rigorously and I got by 280$ rent for the room, 30$ for gym to stay fit, and about 90$ food expenses. Always tried to stay between 400-450$ a month total expenses. Except for visting family on christmas and buying train tickets and extra stuff like that.

My favorite food was 8$ for 1kg plastic packed frozen meat with 1$ pack of noodles, if you put both together in the oven on an aluminum foil, the sauce from the meat would soak into the noodles and you would have a whole kg of meat tasting noodles. Thats 9$ and you can eat it for 2 days easy.

Also jelly and pudding are great to fill the stomach on a budget, 30ct for a packet makes 2kg of jello or pudding.

Buy some flour 1kg for 60ct back then, simply pour some water until it's like dough and put it in the oven, now you've got high caloric makeshift homemade bread. 1kg of flour is about 2 medium sized ""bread"" loafs. Throw some cheap butter and honey on it and you've got your caloric needs for the day met. Always drink water before the meal or eat jello/pudding so your stomach is already full and you don't have to eat much.

I had exactly 2 work shirts that I alternated and handwashed every evening, drying it on a line I span in front of my window. The rest was 1$ fruit of the loom tshirts I wore at home.

Bottom line, it's not really that I earned that much money, it's more that I simply cut out everything I didn't actually need to save money.

A small condominium in the philippines in one of the older areas of manila is about 400k php which equals to 8k$ only. If you have a filipina girlfriend (which is super easy to find as a white guy under 40, women are practically running onto you) doing the buying for you and people don't know they are selling to a white guy you can get it even cheaper.

Those rent out for about 3.5k php (70$) a month. Minimum wage in the Philippines is 537php / day, that is a little less than 11$ per day. So with about 28 working days per month about 15k php or 300$. Keep in mind that it is extremely hard to find work in the philippines, most people here work under the table in sari sari stores and so on, making less than minimum wage.

But you don't want to live like minimum wage worker, you want to retire good middle class, so double that. You need 600$ a month for a comfortable life style without lacking anything, which equals to 8.5 condominiums you have to rent out, let's round that up to 9.

I just googled:

The Top 10% or roughly 1.74 million families of five made an average monthly income roughly PHP55,000 per month.

That is 1.100$ a month for a 5 person household to be upper middle class, so as a single guy with 600$ passive income without having to save money or pay rent, I'd say you're doing more than just fine.

The top 20% starts at 24k php (480$) / month.

So basically worst case you would need an initial investment of about 72k$ to be set for life at age 24, or about 30k if you're fine with living a normal lower middle class life.

Keep in mind that even after renting out your condos you can actually go back to america to keep working some more, basically making your wage + rent income abroad, it's a pretty achieveable amount of money you need to retire.

Yeah this got a bit longer than expected, hopefully it was interesting, thanks for reading.

EDIT: Please don't gild this comment, save the money for retirement or have a beer or something, it is really wasted on me, sorry.

You do know there are actually a lot of countries where you can retire and live like a king? Not dissing the Philippines but you have a lot of options.

""The magnitude and composition of the starvation response (i.e. metabolic adaptation) was estimated in a study of 8 individuals living in isolation in Biosphere 2 for two years. During their isolation, they gradually lost an average of 15% (range: 9–24%) of their body weight due to harsh conditions. On emerging from isolation, the eight isolated individuals were compared with a 152-person control group that initially had had similar physical characteristics. On average, the starvation response of the individuals after isolation was a 180 kCal reduction in daily total energy expenditure. 60 kCal of the starvation response was explained by a reduction in fat-free mass and fat mass. An additional 65 kCal was explained by a reduction in fidgeting. The remaining 55 kCal was statistically insignificant."""

But you don't want to live like minimum wage worker, you want to retire good middle class, so double that. You need 600$ a month for a comfortable life style without lacking anything, which equals to 8.5 condominiums you have to rent out, let's round that up to 9.

I just googled:

The Top 10% or roughly 1.74 million families of five made an average monthly income roughly PHP55,000 per month.

That is 1.100$ a month for a 5 person household to be upper middle class, so as a single guy with 600$ passive income without having to save money or pay rent, I'd say you're doing more than just fine.

The top 20% starts at 24k php (480$) / month.

So basically worst case you would need an initial investment of about 72k$ to be set for life at age 24, or about 30k if you're fine with living a normal lower middle class life.

Keep in mind that even after renting out your condos you can actually go back to america to keep working some more, basically making your wage + rent income abroad, it's a pretty achieveable amount of money you need to retire.

Yeah this got a bit longer than expected, hopefully it was interesting, thanks for reading.

EDIT: Please don't gild this comment, save the money for retirement or have a beer or something, it is really wasted on me, sorry.

Random commenter:

You do know there are actually a lot of countries where you can retire and live like a king? Not dissing the Philippines but you have a lot of options. If this is something you are genuinely interested in, you have a world of opportunities. I've lived in 7 countries and traveled to countless countries...I've come across expat communities just about everywhere. Here is a website you can check out https://www.theearthawaits.com/ but there are loads of blogs on best places to retire, best expat communities, where your money goes far, etc."

2. He gets paid like $80k a year as a salary.

3. The only other money he gets is selling stock to other rich people, so not much of a direct stealing from the poor.

4. Amazon workers get paid well.  If you want to complain, then choose the poor working conditions or something.

5. For your example Bezos is shitty, choose the owners of Walmart or something."

fatlogic,feg25kf,t1_fefsiox,1579073655.0,"Three things commonly referred to as starvation mode:

1. Literally starving, days away from death. Non-critical body process shut down (like reproductive organs) Possible to simulate this by being very lean IIRC, that's why some female athletes lose their periods.

2. Your body runs out of sugar and has to start burning fat. Most people store about 1500 cal of sugar IIRC. You feel like shit and may have less desire to exercise, etc.

3. Calories needed goes down after weeks on a diet. Fatlogic says your body is adapting or some shit. No, your TDEE goes down because you're losing weight. Called adapative thermogenesis. The one study done on this said...

""The magnitude and composition of the starvation response (i.e. metabolic adaptation) was estimated in a study of 8 individuals living in isolation in Biosphere 2 for two years. During their isolation, they gradually lost an average of 15% (range: 9â€“24%) of their body weight due to harsh conditions. On emerging from isolation, the eight isolated individuals were compared with a 152-person control group that initially had had similar physical characteristics. On average, the starvation response of the individuals after isolation was a 180 kCal reduction in daily total energy expenditure. 60 kCal of the starvation response was explained by a reduction in fat-free mass and fat mass. An additional 65 kCal was explained by a reduction in fidgeting. The remaining 55 kCal was statistically insignificant."""
