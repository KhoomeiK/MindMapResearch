I don't really see the difference between OR(turns on when atleast one lamp is active) and XNAND(turns on for everything except when all lamps are active)

Terraria,fdil5vs,t3_elkxsv,1578445348.0,"Hi r/terraria! So I really wanted to set up a ""trap arena"" that I can switch on when it's blood moon or eclipse. I read up on logic gates and I think I mostly understand it, but there seems to be a problem when I'm using it and I can't figure out why. 

In the picture, you'll see that I've connected different traps to the yellow wire(there's two spore lines, one geyser and one fire) and these are all connected to 3 and 5 second timers. 

Initially, I wanted to have one lever to switch them all on so I connected that yellow wire to it. But then I realised its very easy for someone to accidentally toggle it on, so I wanted to use the 'AND' logic gate to make it so that it can only work when both levers above(one green and one blue) are on.

However, after I set it up, when I switch the gate on, traps are activated fine. But when I toggle the levers off, the traps don't stop; they keep going. I feel like I'm missing something fundamental in how Logic gates work and my Business Majors ass has never been exposed to this concept so its confusing me. Can anyone ELI5?

GiftofGames,fcz7q2r,t3_ejhm3k,1578095360.0,"I know a lot of people are defending this person in the comments and for the most part it seems like he is telling the truth and we've been too harsh on him but I still thing there are issues that need to be addressed. Now I think I might be downvoted for going against the vein but I agree with the person making this post. 

I'm saying this as an Indian who was never allowed to buy games. The first game I bought was literally in 2019, at 21 and even the idea of buying a game came only after I got my own debit card. Not only was gaming consoles, digital games and even board games not allowed in my household, but even the act of gaming(I used to pirate them) was heavily criticised. 

So, I understand where the teen OP is coming from. But that doesn't mean it's okay. This subreddit is not that person's sugar daddy that will provide him with games because of his sob story. Games in India go as low as $2 during sales(Portal 1 &2 together was recently 45 rupees which is a little more than half a dollar)  and he's free to buy them without a debit card to raise his steam level(I guarantee you he has the means to even without a debit card, since steam now accepts online wallets). I wish I could side with this dude but I've seen too many instances of farming happening from these kind of accounts and I'm concerned how it's portraying us to be.  

Recently I made an offer post too and someone who was banned contacted me through DM asking me to give it to him because he couldn't comment on the post for some reason. I was almost through with it but when I checked his profile I realised he only chills in GoG and other gifting subs and just in GoG itself he's grabbed 18 and so many more in other subs. The point of this sub is to gift people games hoping they'd actually play them and I feel like people like these who farm gifts are making it hard for that to happen for people who actually want to play the game."
