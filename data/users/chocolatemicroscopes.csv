WinStupidPrizes,femre1w,t1_femcodq,1579267423.0,"Contempt powers are not considered a constitutional violation as it's understood that ""the defendant has the keys to their own cell"" meaning the judge lays out what the defendant must do to be released, it's then their choice to comply or not. The defendant can appeal that decision. There are limits to possible sentencing as well and the judge can't hand out judgements arbitraritly.

 It can seem draconian but it's one of the few abilities a judge actually has to ensure that the litigants in a trial have their right to a fair and speedy trial upheld."
WinStupidPrizes,femqgzt,t1_fem2c9m,1579266613.0,"That's very dramatic, but you're missing a pretty major factor. It's not as though the judge has no accountability. If they abuse their power in unconstitutional ways they can face censure or even removal. 

Everyone has rights, naturally. But if the choice has to be made between defending the rights of victims v rights of defendants, I side with the victims, same as this judge did. 

The full sentence would never have been served. It was meant to shock the whole room into compliance as just kicking her out would likely just make the rest of her group incensed about the ""injustice"" done to her. The woman was either appointed a lawyer or otherwise advised to apologize to the judge, which resulted in the reduced sentence. On the off chance she doubled down on being an idiot, then she gets 3 months in jail to reconsider her choices."

My issues with people's post-Apocalypse  power fantasies were never with the concept of people helping one another, it's that most people have the survival skills of a potato IRL. Everyone presumes they will be the fraction of the population to survive, because... reasons. 

People tend to fall into two camps, those who help others and those who do not. Both have their advantages and their dangers. The social path can get you in trouble if you're naive (and even then) while those who act entirely in self interest might not last long as it would become increasingly difficult to convince anyone to have your back."

You can't honestly tell me you believe that every reference to Nazis online is legitimate, can you? I've seen it applied to very shitty people as well as *by* very shitty people.
