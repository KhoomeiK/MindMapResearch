shittyfoodporn,ffml22c,t1_ffmh5ef,1580056137.0,Never heard of I’ll have to give it a go. Thanks for the recommendation!
WeWantPlates,ffjyh4y,t1_ffizie5,1580010432.0,Never said it was
WeWantPlates,ffif0ne,t1_ffieiij,1579972300.0,Oh I get that. I’m just pointing out how our need for convenience severely out ways our desire to keep our world clean. It’s just crazy to me.
WeWantPlates,ffie8uf,t1_ffie420,1579971774.0,Because fuck the environment.
videos,ffhz7yn,t1_ffhxr2w,1579960056.0,"Oh, and I will now be in hibernation for the next two weeks considering I still have to binge how I met your mother again."
videos,ffhz5bm,t1_ffhxr2w,1579959978.0,Ok if you think I’m going to go to a streaming service that I already pay for and pay more good money to watch a show that’s 20 years old and has zero relevance to today’s world you are absolutely correct. I’m going to binge this shit so hard it’s not even funny. Anyways you’re totally fine man I was tad drunk last as well hence the downvote thing I thought I was being funny and now that I read it sober it was a total face palm moment.
facepalm,ffhmxkg,t1_ffhk22d,1579943041.0,Keep in mind that I have developed other allergies in that same period.
facepalm,ffhmx2l,t1_ffhk22d,1579943021.0,But it’s been the same exact feeling for going on 20+ years now?
shittyfoodporn,ffhmv0v,t1_ffhjvgw,1579942932.0,Woah buddy while I may think cats are cute as shit I hate to break it to you but you cannot beat a dog. As I said in my original reply dog person here don’t fight me
WeWantPlates,ffhhqsc,t1_ffhhhlw,1579935775.0,Obviously I’m kidding but I only recently started liking brussel spouts like a year ago. I just would love to like bloody marys just to try this though!
WeWantPlates,ffhhn43,t1_ffhhhlw,1579935645.0,Is there such a thing as a reddit soul mate!?
videos,ffhhdwf,t1_ffhcyxw,1579935321.0,While I appreciate the new show to watch this so unrelated it’s not even funny. That’s also sad considering it’s a comedy page. Also 20 years old? I’m new to reddit but is it a thing to tell someone you down vote? Because in all honesty I would down vote this so much harder if I could.
videos,ffhd8mb,t1_ffhcyxw,1579930598.0,Wait wtf!?
physicsmemes,ffhd6pt,t1_ffhcdun,1579930544.0,Ok like I said new here thanks..
physicsmemes,ffhbfmb,t1_ffhaz4n,1579928802.0,New to physics here but isn’t that the joke...Hence I would be Dale in this picture?
facepalm,ffhb6a3,t3_etisar,1579928551.0,See my throat gets scratchy with almonds but never the slightest trouble of breathing. Weird or no?
WeWantPlates,ffhaw16,t1_ffh8znc,1579928284.0,I hate bloody Mary’s because I hate tomato juice is this a bit lighter and I could maybe enjoy this?
dirtyr4r,ffh94ri,t3_etlwwj,1579926689.0,well i do need to make another trip to florida here soon....what part are you in?
dirtyr4r,ffh7uum,t3_etiblc,1579925595.0,"well i see youve gotten a little wet there, thats just not quite enough though we need to get you all the way there."
MealPrepSunday,ffh4x6m,t1_ffh4u4d,1579923215.0,I’d be scared if it was her rather than him.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffh44s6,t1_ffgrbgv,1579922599.0,Here in America we have a running joke that anytime something completely batty happens it’s “the Florida man...” we have an entire state that contributes nothing more to the news than a comedy show for the rest of us and it’s also one of the larger swing states when it comes to elections. Not to mention if I want to know anything else outside of our country I can’t look at our news outlets because it’s all biased and crap not sure if that goes both ways though.
videos,ffh3ci8,t1_ffg32zd,1579921988.0,Oh good god. Now I have to binge this series for the 30th time because I didn’t remember this until the birthday quote and considering it’s my favorite show that’s just wrong. So thank you good friend I will be in hibernation for the next week.
shittyfoodporn,ffh2mx1,t1_ffh2hbw,1579921450.0,Lmao I saw the cute face and paw prints and skipped right over the title that’s my bad! Still I stand by that kitty’s decision.
shittyfoodporn,ffh2g27,t1_ffh20gt,1579921303.0,Honestly now that I actually looked more closely at the picture I’m not even mad I’d give that kitty a high five because that’s a sorry ‘grilled cheese’
foodscam,ffh2b6i,t1_ffgk9up,1579921201.0,"You’re over thinking it. With limited pep you want those first few bites of each slice to be cheese and build you up to wanting that pep then once you get to that crust you get it all in one. Nobody wants the last bites of their pepperoni pizza to be cheese only come on now. However, in retrospect I may just be the one who is over thinking it."
shittyfoodporn,ffh1y0a,t1_ffh1jwk,1579920923.0,My sisters cat (one of the few cats I love and loves me) spends most of his time on the damn dinning table walking from plate to plate. This was my introduction to the begging of cats. The bathroom thing is hit or miss though all my dogs have hated bathrooms.
shittyfoodporn,ffh1hg8,t1_ffgzq2o,1579920579.0,Dog person here starting to become fascinated that cats are more like dogs than dogs are when it comes to food.
MealPrepSunday,ffh14st,t1_ffgwipv,1579920316.0,Im not sure whether I should be impressed or frightened.

toptalent,ffgzmcl,t1_ffgtine,1579919168.0,Nah you can speak for me too. The last frame doesn’t show off the artwork very well.
shittyfoodporn,fffejte,t1_fff3pte,1579882235.0,A couple of the Doritos clearly have no cheese flavor in theme duh
shittyfoodporn,fffefkx,t1_ffefd8g,1579882162.0,Tortilla chips are too plain. I live life on the edge
shittyfoodporn,fffedlj,t1_ffe61uy,1579882127.0,Take a knife and make a bunch of slices throw a bit of garlic salt on it and mash it up with a fork.
shittyfoodporn,ffe17kv,t1_ffe0urc,1579834055.0,Now if only guac didn’t go bad in 0.5 seconds we might have something here.
shittyfoodporn,ffe0065,t3_esxckc,1579833179.0,This was a staple of mine in high school. Try doing like three layers though. You have to vary the amounts of cheese per layer in order to get the perfect melt. It becomes somewhat like cheeception and does take practice to make perfect.
WeWantPlates,ffdyxwh,t1_ffdlmt9,1579832407.0,I’m not even mad. I’m impressed.
AnimalsBeingDerps,ffbxrlk,t1_ffab0gp,1579786178.0,I mean it’s what I was drinking at the time.
AnimalsBeingDerps,ffbxn7n,t1_ff9nduk,1579786072.0,You’re the one picturing it...
AnimalsBeingDerps,ffbxk2t,t1_ffbd6hf,1579785998.0,Yep definitely the energy drink
AnimalsBeingDerps,ff9mntw,t1_ff9dcg3,1579716195.0,Sounds delicious. Maybe I’ll make that a reality for you.
AnimalsBeingDerps,ff9bnc3,t1_ff9ao06,1579709276.0,I spit my bang through my nose reading this. Well deserved up vote
Bitcoin,ff4rd86,t1_ff3tnur,1579570599.0,You’re in luck I happened to check and he just asked you if the thread was worth the read. I think we both know the answer to that though
WeWantPlates,fep27u0,t3_eq6nys,1579310489.0,Why are you wasting time taking pictures and not eating this before it melts is the real question here.
Bitcoin,feowz9f,t1_feoo70l,1579307203.0,Oof. That might count as your confession for the week my friend. This thread was mildly entertaining at best. For you to last all the way through I give you the utmost respect!
Bitcoin,feogpk0,t1_feoez9t,1579299939.0,For me or for the attendant? This could get interesting either way
facepalm,feo9gnq,t1_fenxgi1,1579296924.0,Commas...they’re quite helpful when reading..
Bitcoin,feo67f5,t1_feo520o,1579295666.0,Into my car? Are you trying to tell me I’m not supposed to chug it at the counter letting some of it run down my shirt in an overly sexual way while the gas station attendant gives me some dirty looks all while burning my esophagus?
Bitcoin,feo427f,t1_feo2wz2,1579294853.0,Honestly their cappuccino macchiato frappuccino stuff is ok I just can’t do that much sweets. My coffee needs dark and bitter just like my sense of humor.
