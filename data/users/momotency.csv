Some people interpret that as a societal issue, some as a feature of the system America uses to interpret privilege."

It sounds like you didn't care about the subject matter in your English classes, but don't mind writing in general?

Your optimistic attitude is inspiring. Best of luck to you! Feel free to reach out again if you need someone to talk to."
college,fecgf1i,t3_enunf2,1578973297.0,"ACT science does not actually test your scientific reasoning. There aren't national high school ""science standards"" the way there are for reading comprehension and math, so it's basically speed-reading convoluted experimental setups and answering questions about them. I went to a STEM-heavy high school and plenty of people there bombed the science section.

If it's really important you do well on the ACT, I recommend you continue to take practice tests to study for a retake. Treat the science section like weird nonfiction reading if you can. Or you can take the SAT, but since it's a different test, you'll want to practice for it as well."

college,fecfpoy,t3_envsaj,1578972818.0,"My psychology teacher in high school had us do trivia about him. A lot of teachers start with a slide about themselves, actually. It's pretty chill.

My physics teacher was a bit bizarre - he had us all fill out cards answering the same questions about ourselves (name, previous school, fun fact) and then pulled 1-3 out at the end of each class and asked us about ourselves one-on-one (in front of the class.) Wouldn't have been able to pull it off if he wasn't such an entertaining conversationalist.

In a small class, you can have them all fill out answers to the same questions anonymously, then pull one out at the end of each week and have people guess who wrote it (3 guesses generally works for this)

My contemporary history teacher did trivia about foreign policy/geography at the start of each class and threw candy to people who got it right. 

My CURRENT physics teacher had notecards (there's a lot of those, lol) that we had to turn into him during office hours. That way we'd know where to find him outside of class, and he could also get to know us a little.

Most unique icebreaker question I've encountered: ""You have 1 year to eat an entire door. How would you do it?""

You can do something that everyone is talented in - for example, in theatre class we usually start with an improv game, or in music class we listened to samples of 7 singers and worked in groups to determine whose voices had similar qualities. Then the teacher ran statistical analysis on it (most similar: Carmen McRae and Billie Holiday. Most different: Janis Joplin and Brittney Spears.)  


If all else fails, think back to when you were in undergrad (or just out of high school.) What's something YOU would have found fun to do?"

college,fecdly8,t3_eobvyh,1578971406.0,"I had a similar realization this term that I don't want to major in the degree my parents approve of most, and also found an artistic hobby of mine that I love doing and could see pursuing as a career. That being said, if you have 0 experience writing screenplays or in the entertainment industry, I'd recommend getting a major in something else you like and maybe taking a screenwriting course on the side (or getting an internship.) A major in the humanities could help you flex your writing muscles. You didn't mention *what* you hated about English - was it the books you were writing about? Maybe you'd find yourself more passionately writing about history, or comparative government, or international studies.

But you're not going to be able to function in college if you continue to feel depressed and suicidal through your studies. Taking care of yourself should be the first priority. Good luck with everything!"
relationship_advice,fbvfiky,t3_eep8s3,1577130063.0,"I know it's cheesy, but it's really the thought (and not the price) that counts. Think about what made the other gifts special. For the event, you helped her attend something she cared about. As for the jacket, she got you one she already knew you'd like and not a random expensive one just for the sake of it.

I can't give you suggestions based on what she'd like 'cause I don't know her. But I can list some ideas I've had for my friends that might get you started?

Useful things: anything she has that doesn't work very well or broke recently (a nice new pen, a chair). Helps if you can get them engraved or in a color/pattern she likes to personalize them.

Things related to her hobbies: books, movies, games (board/video). If it's a game you can play together, even better!

Events: Lots of people prefer attending things to ""stuff."" Ice skating and escape rooms are relatively cheap options.

Just comforting things: some people love chocolate, or scotch, or homemade mac-and-cheese, and it'll make their day to receive it no matter what time of year. Or you could get her bath salts/lotion/face masks. Also fuzzy socks, especially if it's cold where you are."
