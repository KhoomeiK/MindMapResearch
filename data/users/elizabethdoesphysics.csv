PhotoshopRequest,ffrcin6,t3_eutdgh,1580155226.0,I'm not sure if the request is specific enough. We want a person shaped hole in the photo. The person shaped hole should include my face/ neck and arms/ hands. Then fill those areas in black and have a dotted white outline. We will pay 5USD via paypal.
CrossStitch,ffnwhog,t1_ffnrm0j,1580071641.0,"You do not. However, please stick to the spirit of the competition and keep the back stitching small like the rest of the piece (e.g.; blackwork with 300 cross stitches would not be in the spirit of the competition)."

Though, to be fair, I might be silently judgmental of a piece with fewer than 300 stitches being called a large project. Unless it is physically large, like the size of a wall or something?"

We do not allow sellers to ""hire"" stitchers without paying them. It's not fair to the worker; they give you hours of their time for a pattern worth 3 to 6 dollars? How's that fair?"

CrossStitch,feoitvy,t1_feo9ynt,1579300781.0,Absolutely you can! You can do that with smaller piece of Aida too. :)
thisismylifenow,feohppc,t1_feohich,1579300376.0,Yep. I just slept and then made my husband put on various netflix shows for me to listen to.
thisismylifenow,feoh9me,t1_feoglx9,1579300100.0,I went to the institute founded by the doctor who invented the surgery. Maybe that's why my experience was so smooth and awesome?
thisismylifenow,feoggzx,t1_feofcr6,1579299827.0,"So I did a *very* interdisciplinary project. I created an apparatus to characterize how dye-doped optical polymer fibers and liquid crystal elastomers strain in response to laser light. The end goal was to use these photomechanical materials in various devices to cause macroscopic bending or conformation changes.

My post-doc was at an air force base creating novel liquid crystal optical devices. That's mostly classified info, but I basically made liquid crystals do really cool stuff while focusing on apparatus design, which is where my skills really lie.

I now sell lasers to the government and military. It's nice being out of the lab because I have time to do things like get lasik!"
thisismylifenow,feod7ec,t1_feocn0q,1579298536.0,"Like both eyes? Yeah! It was really smooth and easy! The first step was the most weird. The machine creates a flap the doctor will lift back for the second step. It is like a suction cup thing, and it pushes on your eye until you can't really see. But it's only for like 10 seconds. Then they do the other eye. The next step was the actual lasik, and that was easy peasy because the valium had kicked in and I was really excited about the laser part (I'm a physicist and my PhD work used high power lasers).

As for being scared/ brave, I brought my stuffed honey badger with me. It says phrases from the Randall's honey badger youtube video. When the surgery was over and I pressed his foot, he said ""oh look at that sleepy fuck!"""
thisismylifenow,feoanle,t1_feo9a0f,1579297402.0,"I literally just had the surgery yesterday. It took approximately 10 minutes for the surgery. It wasn't bad at all. I had a lot of nerves and was quite scared for the first part, but the nurses and doctors kept talking and it helped so much. Probably the worst part was keeping my eyes closed for 8 to 10 hours after. I'm 24 hours post op and I can see just fine. I'm using lots of eye drops, but I can see so freaking great for the first time in like 15 years!"

* The title and maker of the kit.
