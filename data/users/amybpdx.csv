Paranoia, delusions, fear and such ramped up agitation makes folks jump out in traffic, off bridges, engage in physical altercations with police, strangers and other users. The chemicals are toxic, cause respiratory issues for smokers, abscesses with needle users. Suicide attempts and self harm behaviors occur more with these users. People spend all day running and hiding from the FBI,  and are resolute in their conviction that their lives are acutely in danger.  I'm an ER nurse. The ONLY folks that freak me out are the meth users."
