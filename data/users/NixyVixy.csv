Portland,ffbf47r,t1_feli5lt,1579762569.0,I hope you get to a place in life where other people doing things they enjoy has no bearing on you doing things you enjoy.   It's clear you're not currently at that point.

CozyPlaces,fewsmsm,t3_eqp9sf,1579418884.0,I love that the kids have options to control their light levels and privacy with the sliding doors.  A bit of controlling your own environment goes a long way towards building self confidence and imagination in kids.
queen,fevbe0v,t3_eqml4a,1579395358.0,This is beautiful in oh so many ways.
Whatcouldgowrong,febtdns,t3_eoac5q,1578962483.0,"This really brings home a point I've seen written about in a lot of Articles talking about how employees don't want weird perks like ping pong tables and slides they just want decent benefits and PTO.   ""With perks like this slide, you're going to need health benefits, amiright?"""

aww,fe013ai,t1_fdy1uzs,1578800488.0,"Thanks to you I just watched ""To be of Service."" A well done documentary, thanks for sharing."
Portland,fdy0bhu,t1_fdxq9cz,1578774691.0,"I agree so much with your sentiment.  I struggle between feeling a bit possessive / protective of our city and how its adapting to change - and simultaneously realizing that every city is a living, breathing, ever-changing organism that we're all a part of.  

I miss open empty lots from downtown to St John's to Sellwood. I miss the rusty wet deteriorating industrial vibe of the Northwest  - almost reminiscent of the house Edward Norton lived in Fight Club.  I recently read The Lathe of Time by Ursula K. LeGuin, which is based in Portland and it only further brought this bizarre nostalgic feeling home having been written in 1971 and yet playing with the idea of future and past time, hence the book title."

AskWomen,fdp2tzq,t1_fdoca6j,1578618668.0,"At a minimum, you've grown some legitimate self awareness which is sorely lacking in most people."
CozyPlaces,fd7as87,t3_ek1h31,1578201687.0,"Linens make a HUGE difference.  Great job on the patterns of your curtains and bedding.  Smart move on the rounded backed chairs, smooth lines, no corners to catch a bruise on.  My only small suggestion is to add a throw pillow with a dash of bright green or blue to the bed.  You've got a beautiful setup and I hope life is treating you well.  Happy  2020!"

relationship_advice,fckuecw,t1_fckqe6l,1577733403.0,"I can emphasize with this feeling quite a bit. Didn't cry much as an adult, until I lost my boyfriend in college due to a freak accident.   Now, 15 years later I can easily cry at a well sung song. 

You're not alone - my husband and I openly sobbed at Coco.  That movie is seriously well done."

AmateurRoomPorn,fcd0bua,t3_egqztm,1577604790.0,"There is an old silly quote that goes something along the lines of, ""There are many people trying to find the right person, but few people trying to become the right person.""

Job well done becoming one the genuinely contributing individuals."

pettyrevenge,fc2cn8x,t3_efp71g,1577352345.0,"You admit the technology wasn't working effectively and it was taking a long time to get paying customers checked in at a tourist trap. You then admit to charging a customer twice and still being shity about the whole thing... the customer may have sucked, but it sounds like the service and experience you're providing do too."
Watercolor,fc23lt5,t3_efn0t1,1577339039.0,Lovely looseness and the emotions it evokes. Beautiful colors.
CozyPlaces,fbtnnaq,t3_eeeb7s,1577086371.0,"Beautiful space, naturally shows the loving effort it took to cultivate.  Nice mix of patterns, all the better when the room is clean! Fresh linens!"
