depression,fel43xt,t3_epm2ch,1579213638.0,In sickness and in health... love is unconditional (as long as you‚Äôre not abusing the other person of course). He was not capable of love. You dodged a bullet before marriage. You‚Äôll find someone way better ‚ù§Ô∏è
depression,fehe5zt,t1_fef0dbl,1579114693.0,Thank you so much for the info and advice! I didn‚Äôt even know the gene tests existed.

depression,fedr4ev,t1_fed2wpl,1579018090.0,"You don‚Äôt necessarily have to be ‚Äúuseful‚Äù, you just need to be important to yourself. Perhaps... like treating yourself like your own child. This means taking care of yourself and your needs. Examples: taking care of your hygiene, staying active, trying to learn new things, eating well, telling yourself to make friends, getting enough sleep. Taking care of yourself/caring about yourself is a really good step,"
depression,fecpe49,t3_eo71t2,1578979904.0,"I feel the same. Sometimes I forget and get distracted. I think when we are happy, we get swept off our feet by life. The only meaning I have been able to find for life is love. It‚Äôs the best distracter of them all. It‚Äôs also super great at throwing you back into an even worser depression when it fails."
depression,fecopro,t3_eofgoa,1578979324.0,"It‚Äôs not always a static answer. While some people may be so important to someone else, and others may not... it can also flip flop. I was once important to an ex... but lost it. However, I‚Äôve also gained it back. Even if you aren‚Äôt important to someone right now, you will be someday‚Äî today, you can be important to yourself."

depression,fc5ue0p,t3_eg7sl2,1577466104.0,Make a game plan with small attainable goals that will help you get there! Otherwise the large task itself can feel daunting. Force yourself to move on and attack each smaller goal. You got this.

However, you need to take action now. You feel as though you missed out on this perfect time, but now is the second-best time. People are still young and childless and going out and doing things. Get out there! Even if you can meet just one new friend, you can expand onto their social circle. You can also try Meetups to meet new people, or there are also a lot of Facebook groups (like hiking or festivals, etc.). You can even take an evening class at your local community college (learn a new instrument maybe?).  There are always new outlets. You can even try an intramural sport through the city or sign up for a yoga studio. There are a lot of opportunities. Don‚Äôt be scared, go for it!"

Gotta work on this and be happy for ME."
childfree,fc5nptx,t3_egaq30,1577462222.0,That‚Äôs so crazy. I assumed you meant that they wanted kids and they said they didn‚Äôt want any either and lied. But they already had one!? That‚Äôs a huge piece of your life to hide and it shows their true character anyways hiding their child!
sex,fc44raf,t1_fc3xsj9,1577406607.0,"I felt this way too. It helped getting comfortable with certain partners (and having a few drinks before too). Say what comes to mind, and don‚Äôt judge yourself before it comes out. Example: I love the way it looks when you‚Äôre pumping it inside me."

My dad recently had another baby with a new woman and the baby is an angel, I might be reconsidering! The 5 year old acts up because her parents divorced when she was so young and neither one tries to be the bad guy. Honestly, more times than not...it isn‚Äôt the child‚Äôs fault. It‚Äôs the parents fault."
relationships,fc3tvyp,t3_efxcto,1577398510.0,No one is easy. We all have our baggage. The goal is that we love our partners enough to stick by their side. You shouldn‚Äôt tip toe around what he said. You should try to find out where he is coming from. Don‚Äôt be accusatory and try to act in a more logical manner.
relationships,fc3tj9b,t3_efxu3z,1577398251.0,This will become a distant memory. It‚Äôll be alright. Keep focusing on the things you were occupying your time with.
relationships,fc3tg0k,t3_efwc9n,1577398186.0,"If you haven‚Äôt taken the love languages quiz (it‚Äôs online), you should take it and have him take it also.

relationships,fc3t8ky,t3_efvc4e,1577398035.0,I had this constant battle with my ex. We dated 3 years and were friends for a few years before that. We met in college. His sister started dating a guy and he could come to things like Thanksgiving and I wasn‚Äôt allowed to. It broke my heart. It felt like he was embarrassed by me and didn‚Äôt want me to be a part of his family. How would I ever marry someone like this? You definitely should talk to her. I‚Äôm sure she could have better reasons than my ex did. Maybe she hasn‚Äôt even noticed her behavior.

Drugs,fc3gjou,t3_efvri3,1577389316.0,"MDMA.  What feels better than feeling euphoric? I am surprised more people haven‚Äôt voted for this one. You gain a sense of love and togetherness with others AND the euphoria. It feels like life has just switched on. What can beat that? Unfortunately, I was taking it once a month and now I haven‚Äôt been able to get it to work for me since September. I have tried LSD and Shrooms a few times each. I get severe anxiety that manifests itself a physical way. I have no idea why this happens when I take those psychedelics (in low doses). I feel extremely claustrophobic and I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe (even half a tab of acid or one stem of shrooms). No place feels comfortable and I feel like I especially cannot he in public and like I won‚Äôt survive. I tried going to a warehouse rave a few months ago after having ONE stem. I like the visual effects and even the newness of the world. However, I spent so much energy focusing on showing my ticket to the bouncer and being extremely paranoid. When we got in, I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe (it wasn‚Äôt crowded). I had to go outside immediately and I still felt like I needed to be at home. I begged and begged my friends to leave within seconds of getting there. They wanted to stay for 20 more minutes and I was practically in tears. Not sure why."
Drugs,fc3frh2,t3_efu7qd,1577388819.0,She could still be worried with a condom. How long ago was it? You should ask her about it in a non-accusatory way AND in-person so you can tell if she‚Äôs lying.
Drugs,fc3fhq3,t3_efvhxb,1577388650.0,I twitch when I come down from mdma and I‚Äôm trying to sleep (12 hours later). It likely is that. Try to stay off of it until the negative effects go away.
Drugs,fc3f5x2,t3_efrdkq,1577388444.0,"I have done it 2x, and the second time... I didn‚Äôt realize it was kicking in yet until I looked in the mirror in a porta potty lol. It had been a few hours, but I was drinking and only had half a piece of acid gum and didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd work. When I looked at myself, I just felt a ‚Äúspooked out‚Äù feeling.

relationship_advice,fc3867w,t3_efqwf1,1577383788.0,"It has been a while since this lie occurred. If it were me, I would say ‚ÄúI just remembered something embarrassing I told you awhile ago that I need to confess to now haha‚Äù and then tell him. Make it nonchalant and tell him you forgot you lied and that you value honesty."
relationship_advice,fc37o1s,t3_eflimp,1577383441.0,"Accept that it‚Äôs also temporary. If you don‚Äôt accept it now, you will be alone later in life and for a longer period of time. Take the short-term pain for the long-term gain. I promise you won‚Äôt be alone forever, or even for long. 

I have suffered through the same thing. I am an extremely dependent person. I find it difficult to be happy in general, so then I get overly reliant on someone else. I have had a few ex boyfriends I have experienced this with. My last one was the worst. I was head over heels for him and he treated me shittily as well. I couldn‚Äôt leave. Argument after argument, we finally broke up permanently (a year and a half ago). It felt so surreal and so painful. We went from living together to NOTHING. I caved about a week or two later and tried to reconcile and he wouldn‚Äôt let me because he knew I was unhappy. Thank goodness he didn‚Äôt. I have now been dating someone much better, but I still don‚Äôt know with certainty if he is the one or not. And I‚Äôm okay with that, if I have to start over again. Even after the last one and I split, I wasn‚Äôt technically alone for a year. I had friends, I had family. I also went on dates and met a bunch of new guys. You won‚Äôt be lonely! You can talk to a bunch of new men. It probably sounds like the last thing you want to hear right now, but soon enough... you‚Äôll be excited to meet new men. Being with someone is often temporary, but being alone is also often temporary. Immerse yourself in a thriving social life, your work, getting caught up on cleaning (car/residence/etc.), meeting new people, download some dating apps (even if just to talk to them and not meet), etc. You won‚Äôt be alone forever. Don‚Äôt tolerate this garbage. It‚Äôs hard to see it from an emotional state, try to see it logically."

relationship_advice,fc34cdq,t3_efwb6e,1577381122.0,I don‚Äôt know why everyone is being so harsh here. I think that‚Äôs a completely normal reaction to have. I would‚Äôve bursted into anger also if I saw things like that. I would get her number and reach out to her and apologize and explain yourself and that it was an immediate angry impulsive reaction and you were very upset because you care about her brother a lot and you were in shock.

When we were friends or even when he was pursuing me, I remember saying ‚Äúguys always want what they can‚Äôt have‚Äù and him saying he wasn‚Äôt like that. Lol, there are no exceptions I guess. Maybe I just need to work on being less reliant anyways. In arguments, he DOES go about his day, and I feel so debilitated that I can‚Äôt do anything. It must be nice to be a man sometimes."
