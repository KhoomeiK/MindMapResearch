bipolar,fehql0l,t3_ep87o7,1579121902.0,I feel this way about becoming an actress or a model.
bipolar,fe3nmig,t1_fe16e9d,1578851072.0,Mania is like....if you took a bunch of uppers and then dont crash for a long time. But when you do crash it's like the end of the world. You never know what could happen if you were to take those all at once. You do a lot more damage to your body than you would want to. But I'd give your extra meds you dont take to your pharmacy to avoid the temptation.

bipolar,fckr866,t3_ehpxif,1577731450.0,I've slept with all my guy friends when I've been manic. It definitely complicates things. And I also understand not taking meds. I used to think it was poison in my body. But then I realized that it helped level me out.
bipolar,fcgmv4k,t3_eh8ao4,1577641799.0,I do the same thing. But I've been trying not to since it's not healthy.

bipolar,fbvfu38,t3_eeoaw1,1577130195.0,Definitely take it at night. I was prescribed it for sleep at night (800mg) and for anxiety (50mg) during the day and it always knocked me out. Make sure to talk to your doctor about it too. I hated seroquel
