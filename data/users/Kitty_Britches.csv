aww,fdlknj5,t1_fdlk3t3,1578526169.0,"Not a stupid question! I think because it's looked more in depth on a deceased person. They test many different fluids from several locations (blood from a few places, urine, eye fluid) A quick screen can show it's present, but I don't believe they can see exactly how much is. I think in cases of deaths where overdose is suspected they look into it much further. And I believe a few different people test the same fluids as well."
aww,fdlk9i7,t1_fdlgucg,1578525917.0,"No, I've never seen it happen.

Quick edit: and that information is protected via HIPPA and cannot be used against someone unless it was like a DUI resulting in injury of another person"
aww,fdlgf8j,t1_fdleq9v,1578523471.0,"EMT here, seconding this. Especially with opiates (a huge problem in my area) I don't give a single shit what someone has taken. If I can treat the OD, great. If not, the ER can when I tell them what has been taken. 

They'll run a tox screen anyways. May as well fess up."
Cruise,fcs6afw,t1_fcs2a0v,1577912033.0,I understand where you're coming from. I hope you have a good time!
Cruise,fcrmg06,t1_fcqxhtv,1577903724.0,To each their own. My husband and I are big introverts and spend a good amount of time in our cabin. It's also really nice to open the curtains at night and watch the ocean and the stars. :)
horror,fcoz6l5,t1_fcoo37a,1577845660.0,I watched that last night. So good.
AskReddit,fcjognf,t1_fcjjkjx,1577696611.0,"Definitely. I'm an EMT and I always speak to or about my patients as if they can hear me. Even if they're unresponsive, comatose or coding. I believe most of the time they can hear you."
peopleofwalmart,fcj9ckf,t1_fci25jy,1577680511.0,I suppose it was just them making fun that hurt.
peopleofwalmart,fchwus6,t1_fchjn68,1577655078.0,"Agreed. This happened to my Jeep and I didn't have the money to fix it. I tried to keep it up with a vice grip but it was stuck down a couple inches. When it rained I had to shut a trash bag in the door to keep the inside dry. 

I was at a store picking up a few things and my Jeep was parked out front. While I was in line these teens started laughing and pointing at my car saying ""Look at that ghetto shit!"" 

It was so embarrassing. :("
