Like, OP assumed she was gay from the way she looked and acted, and I'm sure most people do too. Homophobes aren't going to stop and ask if someone they think is a butch lesbian actually is one before they attack her. Presenting outside of societal norms is commonly rejected as radical or deviant, even today.

I think it's very likely she's been marginalized as though she was a queer person even though she isn't one, and that that slur or others have been deployed against her.

She has the right to a private circle, and a diary is still a diary if you show it to your friends. 

However - her parents absolutely are entitled to see. This is completely on them for not shutting the sister down when it became obvious that she was using the account to bully OP. It's their responsibility to protect their kids from each other."
politics,fehgemu,t1_fehden3,1579116001.0,"I think it's a decent look considering he went into a race against 3 candidates who everyone knows will lock up 70-80 percent of the voter base. Buttigieg, along with Booker, Castro, Yang, and so on went into this knowing he wasn't going to win. It's about getting his name out there."
TwoXChromosomes,fehfzwg,t1_feh60of,1579115760.0,"I think also important is that even if your family did cut you off, the church wouldn't be the one telling them to do so, and would probably advise them against it. There's no enforced shunning, even if there might be voluntary shunning."
AmItheAsshole,feg750u,t1_fee1zzs,1579080160.0,"I think it's NAH for the stepmom - being a dumbass doesn't make her an asshole, and it's pretty likely the dad didn't tell her the money was just enough to pay for college. It probably went down something like ""yeah my dad left his fortune to OP, she has loads of cash..."""

relationships,fecg60u,t1_fec744i,1578973123.0,"Without actually having seen the interaction, it's pretty much impossible to tell whether the OP was right or not honestly. Her previous insecurities might be coming from her own head, or reasonable reactions to shady stuff he's done.

The anger reads strangely to me personally - if I had a partner accusing me of flirting when I wasn't, I'd be distant and pull away, not stomp around throwing my anger in the partner's face. It's also super weird that the friend apologized if nothing actually happened."

You're entitled to want someone enthusiastic about you, and they're entitled to not be enthusiastic about you. Dwelling on brushoffs isn't going to make you feel better - just adjust to taking maybes as nos."
relationships,feceqro,t1_fe6zhgh,1578972167.0,"It's totally possible that OP daring to act like an adult human may in fact damage her prospects - within their crazy-pants religious community that is. In which case, another bullet dodged!"
environment,fecd7mw,t1_feaoyr1,1578971164.0,"I don't understand the point of asserting that conditions would be better if people acted significantly more compassionately, more responsibly, and more intelligently than we ever have - that's obvious. Every system that has ever existed has ended poorly because humans are selfish and kind of dumb. At a certain point you have to admit that the problem is humanity generally, not just one specific economic system."

If a Jewish politician started making noise about getting rid of Israeli Muslims and invading Lebanon, for example, that would be a perfectly valid comparison to make."

MurderedByWords,fe6g00p,t1_fe6fr5a,1578889759.0,"i don't consider it relevant whether he was touching himself or not or in the same room or not. he was sexually pleasuring himself while his wife was having a miscarriage. that's the part of this that's fucked up. clinging to details like ""he wasn't around to console her while her fetus was coming out"" doesn't make it sound any better."

MurderedByWords,fe4p1lz,t1_fe4mbsa,1578861545.0,"Yeah, I think it's pretty telling this OP left out the context that the husband is addicted to porn to the extent that he was jerking off during a miscarriage, and that he never makes her cum... 

I still think it's wrong to say it's the husband's fault she's cheating, but I think it's understandable how she would feel like she's trapped. It takes a lot to be able to choose to break up your family."
AmItheAsshole,fe3nyje,t3_enot71,1578851207.0,"I'm honestly surprised at the y t a judgements. Would OP have been wrong to confront her or be upset at her or trash her to his friends? Yes, of course. That's not what happened, though. He's entitled to feel upset and hurt after a breakup, even at things that don't make logical sense. He also has no obligation whatsoever to be friends with his ex. It's hard to see what other response he could have had to this in order to meet the standards of the people commenting - should he have just sucked up his hurt and continued to be friends with someone he didn't want to be anymore? That's not a reasonable ask. 

That business aside, the ex taking this opportunity to spill details about OP's fetishes to a mutual friend makes her a definite asshole. This is at absolute most e s h."
AmItheAsshole,fe10aam,t1_fdwj2c9,1578821004.0,"I don't think that it's just her money stops OP from being an asshole here - both because retroactively adding strings to gifts is automatic asshole behavior, and because pulling the tuition now completely guarantees the niece will veer hardcore into deep fundiehood."
relationships,fdzcaup,t1_fdz492s,1578788794.0,but like... what here shows he'd care about OP going to go visit a boyfriend in the same way he describes seeing the gf? it really seems like you're just assuming that the only reason he isn't against it is because he hasn't thought about it. i know it's a common theme in poly posts but it's not the issue here at all
