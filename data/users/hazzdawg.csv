digitalnomad,ff2vij6,t1_ff2v7bo,1579525768.0,"Certainly not the islands. And the ones that do are difficult to access, requiring you to clamber on and off ferries, walk across beaches, climb up steep Rocky paths, etc. 

I can tell you from personal experience that you don't want a suitcase in these places. Nor in many of the other 500+ plus I've been. 

I'm saying a backpack makes life much easier in these situations. After all, that's why they were invented."
digitalnomad,ff2v11v,t1_ff2uo6v,1579525255.0,"Off the top of my head...

The perinthian islands, kapas, labuan bajo, Koh Rong, Koh Rong saloem, the gillis, tioman, most places in rural Myanmar.

I'll be island hopping across the phillipines next month then overlanding across Sumatra. I expect having a backpack will come in handy there too."
digitalnomad,ff2uj4f,t1_ff2tvf3,1579524703.0,"Lots of small islands don't have taxis. And You sometimes have to lug your shit over several ferries to get to the one you need. 

Loads of places don't have smooth paths leading from your hotel to the nearest road, either. Sometimes there aren't even paths at all and you just walk across the beach to get to your accomm.

And often the only transport available are tiny little scooters.

I can think of about a dozen situations where a suitcase would've been a total pain in the ass for me last year.

But again, that's just me. I recognize that most DNs don't go these places. I don't have it in for wheeled suitcases; it just wouldn't work for me."

digitalnomad,ff2ncie,t1_ff2fntw,1579514632.0,I think it really depends on where you travel. Remote and off the beaten track destinations are usually far less suitcase-friendly. Those hopping between major cities every few months don't need to worry about it.

Neither Ireland or the US has anything near a ""low cost of living city"" by global standards. Not even one.

solotravel,fexknhy,t1_fexirr3,1579432527.0,"The places with low cost of living don't have high minimum wages. Period. Things are cheap because these countries are fucking poor. Minimum wage earners struggle to afford basic necessities such as elecricity, shelter, and three meals per day. A first world person is not going to enjoy these conditions unless they're used to living in poverty back home.

I've seen it first hand all too often, Europeans working their ass off for $10 per day. They get sick of it pretty fucking quick and have to work a lot more than 60 hours to make ends meet. Most are usually dipping into their savings as well.

If you honestly think you can have a less stressful life by living on minimum wage in a third world country, then I suggest you actually try doing it yourself. I have, and I can tell you it's anything but the good life. The romanticism behind the notion is fake as fuck. And besides, it's also illegal AND immoral as you'll be taking employment away from locals who actually need it.

You're better working remote to earn a day's minimum wage in like 20 minutes. Or just saving money at home in the first world and traveling on that."
solotravel,fexgh82,t1_fex6ebv,1579430597.0,A minimum wage job in the cheapest country you can find is just living in poverty. 99 percent of people wouldn't enjoy that.

digitalnomad,fe6rg4p,t1_fe6q3tt,1578901886.0,"Well, it's important to consider all the inclusions, exclusions, and excesses... But yeah, it's expensive.

The most overpriced thing imo is international expat/health insurance which costs several times more than travel insurance. Absolutely not good value at all for non Americans."
digitalnomad,fe6oj0i,t1_fe622h8,1578898228.0,">Seriously, go with a larger provider.  If their $200-300/month is too much just get emergency services (e.g. raise the deductible to $10k) and it should drop to around $50/month.  You'll need to pay for everything out of pocket, but healthcare in most of the world is pretty damn cheap anyway and you'll actually be covered in case of a $1M bill.  If you go with their normal insurance they will allow primary health care anywhere in the world (Travel insurance is only secondary, so they'll bitch whine and moan about you using them to do anything 'normal' even though it is covered).Insurance for stuff: Renter's insurance in the US is by far the best way to handle this.  I honestly don't know of a great solution for non-Americans, sorry!

OP doesn't say where they're from. If they are American, then yes they should certainly get primary healthcare because travel insurance will just send them home in an emergency, as you say. If they're from Australia, the UK, NZ, Canada, or just about any other developed country in the world, then travel insurance is fine because universal healthcare will cover you when you get back (just be sure your Medicare Card or equivalent has not expired). 

As for World Nomads, never used them but they're actually pretty expensive compared to similar Australian policies. I know they have a very generous affiliate marketing program, which is why you see them on every travel blog ever."
digitalnomad,fe6o5he,t3_enzum1,1578897790.0,"If money is tight then don't bother with all that stuff. You don't really need it, and the blogs that promote it are all just trying to make money off affiliate marketing.
