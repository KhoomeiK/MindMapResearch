Ah, yes. The character so unpopular, they intentionally *didn't* release a whole product themed around that character.

And it wasn't as if Gideon's death was the logical conclusion of his whole character arc. Now, Dack and Dovin, on the other hand..."

Regardless, this is one of my favorite pieces of THB, and definitely one of my favorite pieces of yours. Gallia looks like a fun girl I'd be happy to spend more time with. I'd sell my left hoof and horn to attend one of her parties!"

It was also used to “sanitize” water, as the alcohol content made it safer to consume, especially in urban areas.

Here are some examples I don't think anyone has listed yet. Those are all cards I do want to see in Standard, are of power level that is adequate, and can be reprinted in a Core set (so evergreen keywords only):

Conspiracy: Take the Crown

* [[Recruiter of the Guard]]

* [[Custodi Soulbinders]]

* [[Flamewright]]

Commander:

* [[Heirloom Blade]]

* [[Illusory Ambusher]]

* [[Restore]]

Battlebond:

* [[Bonus Round]]

* [[Cheering Fanatic]]

* [[Last One Standing]]

* [[Saltwater Stalwart]]

Modern Horizons:

* [[King of the Pride]]

* [[Segovian Angel]]

* [[Oneirophage]]

* [[Pondering Mage]]

* [[Defile]]

* [[Ransack the Lab]]

* [[Llanowar Tribe]]

* [[Goblin Oriflamme]]

* [[Good-Fortune Unicorn]]"

mtgcube,ff48hjp,t3_eqvvoy,1579557837.0,"Cool video! I see so many people praising [[The First Iroan Games]], I might give them a try!

On a similar note, have you ever considered [[Eat to Extinction]]? I know 4 mana is a lot for removal, but Planeswalker removal is always a premium, the spell is easily splashable with only a single pip in its casting cost, and it has the added benefit of Surveiling for 1."
magicTCG,feu7p00,t1_feu03fg,1579383900.0,Yep. That's what I mean.

magicTCG,fep6b0p,t1_fep4q6w,1579313100.0,"I remember somebody shared an Innistrad plane icon a few years back.

Ravnica and Dominaria are nigh impossible. Ravnica has so many iconography associated with it, it is impossible to combine it all into one cohesive symbol. Dominaria has the reverse problem, where there's a lack of iconography. I know the Dominaria set icon is supposed to be a shield, but I still can't help but look and see a robot's head.

Mirrodin will be quite hard to create a single icon for IMO, since so much changes between the two blocks.

On that note, some planes that might be possible to create such icons for:

* Ixalan (3 set icons)
* Tarkir (3 set icons + wedge icons)
* Zendikar (lots and LOTS of hedrons!)
* Amonkhet (2 set icons + archenemy)"

My current main cube list can be found here: https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/vistas

There are some differences, as I haven't updated the list in some time.

I'm currently 140 cards into my Theros cube, and for that cube I intend to proxy some of the cards (no way I am paying $200 for a bunch of God cards that make up 3% of the cube!)"
MagicArena,femztav,t1_femwtnb,1579273764.0,Which makes it a better experience compared to Arena draft IMO. The fact that it's virtually free makes it so much more appealing. It's easier to build a full collection for free through Arena in Hearthstone than through Draft in Magic Arena.
MagicArena,femx7ul,t1_femt8eg,1579271964.0,"Hearthstone has Wild and Standard ladder and casual (I'm counting those as two), plus Arena, plus this new Autobattler mode that came out since I quit, plus a variety of Single Player options, plus weekly Tavern Brawls.

Of those, the Tavern Brawls are the only event that's on a schedule – each week it is a different play mode with new rules, and the event is 5 days long IIRC.

Let that sink in. The only event in Hearthstone that is on a scheduled basis is Tavern Brawl, and all the major modes (including Wild ranked ladder, which is Hearthstone's version of Historic) are free to play and available all the time.

Meanwhile, Arena has ONE mode that's permanent. Best of 1. 

Yeah, ""heartstone doesn't have additional modes under paywall cause it has no additional modes"".

That's a funny one, tell another joke."
MagicArena,femp1zy,t1_femjbi7,1579265291.0,"I'd say it doesn't have a decent economy when compared to Hearthstone. Hearthstone doesn't keep game modes behind such absurd paywalls – it's just the (Hearthstone) Arena mode that costs 150 gold, which is the equivalent of 1,500 gold in MtGA, and no matter how badly you perform, you are still awarded packs and gold.

Magic Online is a thing of its own, more than 20 years old, different enough for a variety of reasons (notably, you *own* the cards, and can sell them). Comparing MtGA to a physical game is pointless."
europe,felcrnc,t1_fel2zt2,1579219129.0,I couldn't find almost any information on Adam Tolkien online. Is he really that involved with the materials? What about any remaining unpublished works?
MagicArena,fekt8i5,t3_epmy4u,1579207118.0,"I am not one who usually whines top much, but I am seriously considering quiting Arena. It's insulting that they are willing to put every queue behind a pay wall, but the client itself is so riddled with bugs you are extremely likely to lose multiple games on release day, and thus lose the gems you've paid.

In other words, you are paying with real money, and losing real money.

This is not a finished game, not by long shot."
