AmItheAsshole,ff4msvt,t1_ff4gao2,1579567414.0,I'm sure they aren't loved any less but you can't possibly give attention properly to 13 kids because there are not enough hours in a day with school and housework and jobs and the kid's lives. When they have them raise each other for whatever reason it is abuse through blatant neglect and a lot worse than just having so many. I knew these christian people who homeschooled their kids and they all raised each other. It was horrible and they were terribly restricted. Every single one of the kids was stunted in a couple ways and there was no way it was healthy. The parents clearly loved them all very much but it was a mess.

I'd almost say it's worse to ban the teachers from touching the kids because little kids often need to be lifted away for safety or what if some kid sprains an ankle and two other eight year olds have to help them to the nurse?

He doesn't deserve people telling him he doesn't care about his wife or child and the baby does need to bond with them both. There are just steps they could take to get help and move forward more healthily. A bit strange that she wouldn't trust him with the kid but hormones and adrenalin are a hell of a drug.

After washing and drying they fluff up and then you can do a touch up. For the log part, take small sections berween two fingers, stick it straight out from your skull, and cut it diagonally out. You should then have them naturally wanting to go in towards your head so it will require less styling. It looks like she styled it or has a pen with some product though."

TrueOffMyChest,ff2lnfq,t1_ff1t74a,1579512003.0,Body positivity is something that should be ' everyone has good points and deserves to be treated well regardless of body shape ' and not an excuse for an unhealthy lifestyle where you loose or gain too much. OP has done an amazing health transformation and real body positivity people would be happy for them. If someone can't fix it in under five minutes like bleeding or broccoli in their teeth then you don't point it out. People KNOW they have acne and scars and a lazy eye and wonky teeth. You pointing it out just makes them feel weird about it.

ADHD,fetdwn0,t1_feqzeew,1579374374.0,Damn dude that sucks. I'm asian and living in the west so I look about 14 especially because I am 5ft and 95lbs. I also have ADHD / ADD combo. I get infantilized all the time and it's horrible. Like yes I do have it pretty ' severely ' but I am a grown ass adult and even kids shouldn't have anything babytalked but instead explained in an age appropriate way. We are all smarter than what these people think. I can't believe you got someone so cold and insensitive. If you ever wanna talk hmu.
