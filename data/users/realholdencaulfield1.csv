aww,fgisc37,t3_eypbjd,1580829826.0,I like buddies working together. Coyote looks so happy he has found a friend.
aww,fg5580h,t3_ews2gp,1580518573.0,"That is just brilliant, I feel all senior dogs need a home to live out their lives. People that throw away a pet after years together do not deserve to own a pet ever again b/c they don't know what owning a pet means. It's for life, good or bad. They love you no matter what so do the honorably thing & treat them the same way with love, care& dignity. Your Dad is a great man for doing something that wonderful for Rock! I hope they are happy together, I'm sure Rock is over the moon! Cheers"
