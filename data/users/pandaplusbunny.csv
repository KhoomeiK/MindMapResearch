Also, the “massage” feature as described in the spectra manual was the opposite of what my lactation consultant recommended, which was fast light sucking for two minutes followed by slower deeper sucking for 18 minutes (to mimic baby’s actual sucking progression). The spectra has it set up to do the 55ish speed first and then says switch to 72 massage mode. Maybe try reversing that? 

I also did power pumping a few times around three weeks to prepare for baby to come home from NICU. I found an info graphic on Google but it was something like 15 on 15 off 15 on etc. for one session per day for three days."
