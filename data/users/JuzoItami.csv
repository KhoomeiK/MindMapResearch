OTOH, Family ""B"" are doing pretty well, but the roof is going to need to be repaired in a year or two and they should probably be considering setting up a college fund for their kids.  But they don't.  Instead  Ma and Pa ""B"" go on two cruises, buy a pair of jet skis, and get matching rings to symbolize their ""recommitment"" after 15 years of marriage.  They run up $20K in credit card debt to finance all this.  They have a great couple of years, but because they don't replace the roof they get leaks, which results in expensive water damage to their house.  And their kids hate them because they never started a college fund.  And their crappy rings and rusty jet skis have very little resale value.  And all they can think is ""We really need to get more credit"".
