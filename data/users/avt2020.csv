rape,ffh1fj1,t3_etjx86,1579920540.0,"I know how you feel to an extent. I was also raped by my boss. He kept making moves on me and kept forcing me to do stuff, so I tried to rationalize it in my head. He got worse every day and made me cry every time I saw him. Grabbing me, touching me, saying the ugliest things to me. 

I couldn't have anybody touch me for months after that. I was so depressed and wanted to die. I thought about driving off the road so many times. 

Hang in there, you are so incredibly strong.
It is the hardest thing ever. You will be able to have sex and feel love and be loved. It will sadly just take time. 

Slowly work your way up by doing what you feel comfortable with. 

Remember, it was never your fault. He knew exactly what he was doing. He was the adult. 
It was NOT your fault. 
And you are not alone."
Anxiety,ffaafja,t1_ff9zdll,1579731038.0,"I think I'll give that a try when I can, thank you!"
Anxiety,ff9vrl7,t1_ff9ukdd,1579722575.0,"So true, I'm going to give it my best shot. They're not going to be anything over 15 minutes. I usually try to get out of them if I can but it's just not going to be possible for all of these. 

I have friends in each of these classes besides one so it will definitely help. I just don't do well for huge groups but I'll try my best to imagine they're all gone and I'm only talking to 1-2 people."
gmu,ff9mz05,t3_eser6d,1579716381.0,"You can go multiple times in one semester, but the minimum is either the amount of semesters you'll be here for. Or if you'll be here for 5 semesters or longer, you have to take it at least 5 times.


They really don't recommend you to take it multiple times in a semester but if you want to knock it out that's what I recommend. The papers aren't hard to write."
Anxiety,ff9m427,t3_esex9u,1579715871.0,"Good job! It is so incredibly hard, I've been there before. I remember going and I didn't even want her to touch me and just left. She understood and it just made me feel so stupid and ashamed. 

That's such a milestone, congrats :)"

TalesFromRetail,fekrio1,t3_epkqap,1579206109.0,What a piece of shit. That poor dog deserves so much better than to be left out in the cold like that. I don't know how these people can do that.
WorkOnline,fei30rg,t3_ep5853,1579129164.0,"Honestly, it's worth a try. Lionbridge is a little unpredictable sometimes. I got fired after completing all of the onboarding, then months later when I didn't need the job, I get a message saying I can reapply and they'll take me."
MakeNewFriendsHere,fei2h5x,t3_ep0px8,1579128830.0,"That first point is literally a mood

Feel free to message me, 22 F

Would love to share music suggestions sometime, that'd be pretty cool :)"
Staples,feh7kfz,t3_ep5iit,1579110793.0,"That sounds pretty normal for Staples honestly, at least that's how it was for my store. At times I think it was only 2 who could open and close. One manager has to open and close certain days by herself at one point."
depression,fe07g7o,t3_engd6e,1578805069.0,"I really loved it in theaters, I honestly almost cried in the beginning. It was sad, but extremely relatable. It's just nice to know some people know what it's like to have any sort of mental illness."
gmu,fdzqgxl,t3_endmk7,1578793436.0,"It's a pretty good school and I'm an art major.

Anxiety,fdikhpn,t3_elf74v,1578444925.0,I'm completely the same way. Talking face to face with people is really hard for me when I'm used to texts. And I have always hated calling people. Or when people called me.
personalfinance,fdiifnj,t3_elgk11,1578443629.0,"I think that's pretty common for most people, I know I mentally panicked when I saw my bill on a very nice work computer being $1K when I knew it would last much longer than other computers I've had. 

To me it just seems like a force of habit, spending money in general makes me think. I try to do some quick math in my head on which option would be better and if it is the more expensive option due to the value, it makes me feel way better. 

Don't know if that'd work for you but it may be worth a shot."
depression,fdidbg1,t3_elhhgz,1578440316.0,"Not weird at all. I feel the same way all too often, not being able to get close to people. I have a long term partner and a few acquaintances but that's about it."
period,fdi5zod,t3_el7tpi,1578436332.0,"I usually feel very unattractive on my period with some combination of being horny and very turned off. When my boobs are like sandbags and when my stomach feels like it's a beanbag, I'm not into anything."
depression,fdf67l7,t3_ekqsl7,1578354235.0,I'm a lonely individual who is 22 and in a big University as well. I've had a hard time making long term friends and all of mine have either graduated or moved away. It's really depressing. I'm content being a loner most of the time but sometimes I just want one or two friends that aren't my partner that want to talk to me.
Frugal,fdcpqz0,t1_fdcitr8,1578280957.0,"Lately I've been trying to sell some of my old electronics and I'm thinking of selling some old books I haven't touched in years. I've made some decent money and even sold my surface 3 for the same price I got it for a few years ago.
I may try to go further with that. Thank you"

Frugal,fdbipxu,t1_fdba1j9,1578257784.0,"$13.50/hr, yeah I try to think about that, usually it does work."
Frugal,fdbcfvo,t1_fdb2dxz,1578255971.0,I do! I haven't been in awhile because of their new hours around the holidays but definitely a great idea! :)
toxicparents,fdawg9x,t3_ekfi60,1578251150.0,"I'm 22 and know exactly how you feel. It's hard to really know how to really deal with it. I know ever since I was younger I eventually stopped telling them everything I do but the bare minimum. I'd just start to do more of what I want. Otherwise I'd get never-ending doubt and disappointment from them.

My best advice to you would be to take care of yourself. See a therapist, get on antidepressants,etc. I'm not sure if you're doing any of those but I know since being on antidepressants, I don't feel nearly as depressed as I used to. It gave me more of an ""I don't care"" type of attitude about most of my anxieties."
Frugal,fdarnvm,t1_fdaojrj,1578249288.0,I'll give that a try! I've been thinking of doing that lately.
Frugal,fdaiyo8,t1_fdahsyi,1578246577.0,"I actually have most of my savings in a high yield savings, it's recently decreased it's interest to about 2% but every bit does help. Thanks!"
Frugal,fdai1be,t1_fdagm6z,1578246336.0,"True, I have an antique shop pretty close by I've only been to once. I'll have to give that a try, thanks! :)"
Frugal,fdahwm7,t1_fdagzi8,1578246277.0,"Yeah I definitely see what you mean. After I figure out my expenses for my apartment I got approved for, that'll be my next thing I'll do."
Frugal,fdagjp9,t1_fdaef39,1578245835.0,"Thank you, I'll give that a try. I have a decent amount of credit cards out but only really use 2/4. I never go over about $200 for any of them with the exception of very few high purchases (ex: new work computer, school parking pass). I've been thinking about investing some of that money but I'm just not sure of the direction I want to go. 

But I'm definitely leaning towards paying my loans off asap. I still have almost another year before interest kicks in on them. 

My main goal is just getting the hell out of my parent's house because of my job. Even though it's not paying a lot, it's enough to live off of (about $30K a year)."

Anxiety,fd3gp8h,t1_fd0dled,1578158194.0,"Thank you :) I really appreciate that. That makes me feel a lot better. I eventually want to own my own business and I genuinely enjoy being there. Sometimes it just makes me feel nervous that I'm not good enough for that place, but I'm just going to try my best and be 100% honest with them. Hopefully that's enough. :)"
Anxiety,fd3ged4,t1_fd0aj82,1578158098.0,"Thank you :) I really appreciate it, this is my first ""real"" job so at times it doesn't even feel like I earned it and my anxiety goes crazy."

Staples,fcybgwp,t3_ejflrr,1578077670.0,"It took another person reporting and my harasser acting like a psychopathic asshole before he FINALLY got fired. It took months.

Thankfully no longer work there and appreciate my positive new work environment. 

Good luck to you guys, do whatever you need to in order to get that dipshit fired."
Frugal,fcya6ek,t1_fcwbrrd,1578076980.0,"True, I didn't even think about that. I'll have to give that a try when I want someone else to do it."
Frugal,fcw5re3,t1_fcw4wm4,1578017794.0,That's insane! Great that you can do a trim yourself at home- I can't imagine having that unmanageable of hair. Mine is stick straight while my entire family has curly hair lol.
Frugal,fcw5l5k,t1_fcw4vy9,1578017680.0,"I know exactly what you mean! I'm a woman and I just hate being in a salon. I don't feel like I can relate to any of those women and there's always the pressure to hold a conversation with the hairdresser too. 

If I can get the job done myself in no time, I'm fine just doing it myself and maybe it won't be as perfect as in a salon but it feels like a great accomplishment! 

I've looked around on YouTube, it's something I'll definitely have to give a try following when I have more time. Thanks :)"
Frugal,fcw5eke,t1_fcw58dk,1578017555.0,"Hell, I'd do that too if I was into hats lol. Whatever works for you (plus you save money on shampoo!)"
Frugal,fcw5985,t1_fcw4fx1,1578017457.0,"Definitely, I'm not about to compare myself to someone who actually has the talent and went through training to cut hair. I've been told by others that I've done a great job and that they couldn't tell I cut it myself. 

(I'm a woman btw lol) I'm not one who enjoys the long wait and gossiping many women seem to love at the salon. I dye my own hair and cut my own hair and I'm fine with it. I just don't feel like driving there, waiting, driving back, and it taking an hour or so to get my hair cut or dyed. 

A trim is very easy to do at home honestly."

EPA,fclvoxe,t1_fcltse8,1577757606.0,"I've tried but honestly it's hard to find what I'm really looking for. I guess I'll just keep looking and trying to decipher it, some of it's hard for me to exactly understand.

Thanks for the response though!"
Frugal,fcluduj,t3_ehugl9,1577756696.0,"Honestly I prefer using credit cards because with either of my cards (discover It or amex blue cash everyday) I get 2% back. So that makes up for the difference it'd be in cash. I pretty much never use cash anymore. 

I've only prepaid inside once because I had issues with the pump. Otherwise credit is preferred to me."
Frugal,fclropa,t3_ehsmt0,1577754829.0,"Honestly, yes. I honestly havent found any tinted moisturizer I love as much as my Nars tinted moisturizer. The best compromise I find is buying my makeup on eBay (careful to make sure it's the real deal) or buying it in store on sale. I tend to spend less that way knowing I love the brand and sticking to what works for me."
Frugal,fc6j1w2,t1_fc44o6u,1577481756.0,"Oooo I have seen stuff about beeswax wraps, sounds like it'd be worth it!

Frugal,fc6iy10,t1_fc4ijo6,1577481684.0,"I've heard about that, it's not exactly something I'm willing to do personally, but kudos to finding something that works for you! 

My partner and I are wanting a bidet and are ok with spending some money on cheap TP for drying :)"
Frugal,fc4fjdo,t1_fc49scl,1577415189.0,"Give that a try for sure, I know I've been thinking of doing something for cloth makeup removers. I don't use enough to really want to buy premade ones so handmade seems like the best route to go."
Frugal,fc49m5j,t1_fc48erq,1577410371.0,"I definitely agree on the period panties and pads, plus they feel so much better on me than regular disposable pads. 

I'll keep up with getting more reusable bags/containers in the future. Those always seem very useful to have around."
Frugal,fc49i14,t1_fc46tya,1577410280.0,"That's pretty cool! I'll have to give the Mason jars thing a try, I've seen them very cheap in some places."
Frugal,fc49btf,t1_fc46m6v,1577410143.0,"I've always wanted to try one but I've been using reusable pads for about a year now. So far they're working really well. 

I'll have to get those wool dryer balls a try, I've heard those can really save you a lot of money!"
period,fc43p49,t3_eg2qkh,1577405817.0,"No, you're definitely not. I don't understand how he could think pads that aren't even used are so ""gross"". I know for my house my mom usually kept her pads in a specific drawer of the bathroom so I don't see how that's a problem. My brother and dad never cared. And when I got my period I basically did the same until I switched to reusable pads. 

He is definitely making an argument about nothing honestly."
Anxiety,fc219de,t3_efqerm,1577336477.0,I do that too sometimes. I just feel like whatever I say or ask is stupid and that the other person will be mad or annoyed. It sucks :/
