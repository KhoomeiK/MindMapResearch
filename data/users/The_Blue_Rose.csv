relationship_advice,ffv1p95,t3_evdbux,1580253655.0,"How could you be in love with someone you've only spoken to a handful of times? Do you know much about her? Are you in love with the idea of her, and what ideas projected onto her?"
relationship_advice,ffv1e9z,t3_evdecs,1580253456.0,"You're not going to spend your life with her. You're 15. Please realise this.

How could you possibly spend your life with this person if you can't communicate?"
relationship_advice,ffv0x90,t3_evdj3m,1580253150.0,"OP, If your husband is forcing you to have sex with him, he's raping you.

Leave him. You do not owe him anything and you owe yourself so much more. He clearly doesn't seem interested in actively making your marriage work, or even being married at all. He seems to - by how you describe him - just want a maid."
cats,ffv0lie,t1_ffujzrb,1580252953.0,"Your indoor cat views the other cat as a threat to its resources, and its access to/time with humans too most likely. Please do not bring this cat inside into your indoor cats territory."
relationship_advice,ffuzghf,t3_evdanp,1580252304.0,"You're currently infatuated with each other. It's not love. Just relax, take the time to get to know each other and have fun. There's no need for her to be panicking after your first date!

Her past issues are in her past. If she doesn't want to continue that behaviour, she won't."
twinpeaks,ffuz642,t1_ffuc5hd,1580252149.0,Because the moderators are somehow allowing it. And because Kaleviko/Karlos thinks he's ON THE BRINK OF SOMETHING HUGE....for the last 250+ days

badroommates,ffuv4se,t3_evcoz8,1580249925.0,Stop with the texts. Tell her that leaving dirty dishes for this long isn't on. You both share a communal space and it needs to be kept clean. If she doesn't get the message then stack them up and leave them at her door.
cats,ffuh3dd,t1_ffugh8z,1580241816.0,"Cats are like kids, the novelty wears off of toys pretty fast for some. You have to alternate what you use. 

It's often how you play with them as well. I don't know if you've already seen [this video ](https://youtu.be/sR0StLh6uKE)  but it has some good tips you might find helpful.

Also most cats sleeps for up to 18 hours, but they do need a lot of active playtime. Try to remember that it's crucial for a dog to be walked every day, it's the same way for cats and playtime."
cats,ffug8o8,t1_ffufup5,1580241310.0,"Most cats like being petted. Not all cats like to be picked up, so don't try to pick her up anymore.

She definitely needs positive attention and a decent stretch of playtime. What kind of toys do you have for her? How do you play with her? Do you have a brush for her? Does she go outside at all or is she an indoor cat?"
cats,ffu5uqx,t1_ffu4tus,1580235132.0,I'm fairly certain some companies offer salmon flavour or other palatable flavours for cats if that helps. Wish you both all the best!
cats,ffu3dzn,t3_ev8kwg,1580233627.0,He's only 2? Poor baby. I've never heard of any animal having this condition at such an early age. All you can do is make him comfortable. I definitely recommend a good brand of CBD suitable for cats. It should help with the pain and discomfort.
cats,ffu38sv,t3_ev8mrw,1580233537.0,That's because you're not supposed to bathe cats.
cats,ffthhgq,t3_ev614x,1580220668.0,Perhaps she's lonely and just wants company. Is she an outdoor cat or something? I'm just not understanding why your cat wanting to be by your side is such an inconvenience.
insaneparents,ffthdjt,t1_fftfupv,1580220583.0,He's clearly named in the post and his face is shared. Not sure how that's them keeping their anonymity.
cats,fftfjdf,t3_ev5pxu,1580219088.0,"If he/she fits, he/she sits."
insaneparents,fftfej7,t1_fftfbna,1580218976.0,"So it's somehow my fault that he's a misogynistic piece of shit?

That's gonna be a no from me dawg."
