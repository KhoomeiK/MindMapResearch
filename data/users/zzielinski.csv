I mean, an enormous segment of the population  believes that we are destroying the planet and collectively denying it in order to protect the market, but it’s radical to suggest that the powers that be would develop the same attitude towards this current scenario?

That being said...it’s more fun to imagine a catastrophe than to observe the world like an adult."

You could also factor in anti-scalper pricing that deters artists from doing cheap concerts in big venues."
