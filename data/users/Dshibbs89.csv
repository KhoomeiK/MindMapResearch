AskMen,ffdjckw,t3_esruuu,1579822099.0,"Married 8 years this year.  I wear mine at all times except for when I take a shower, work under the hood of a car, or work with raw meat while cooking.  It doesn't bother me to wear it, I think because I have the correct ring size and the style of my ring is comfortable."
USPS,ff6annh,t3_erp221,1579623025.0,My office has slightly more than a regular Monday volume and we're in an affluent area.  We were expecting to get hit.  I was asked to step up to higher level and close the building but I don't even have any 96s past 6pm!  Hallelujah!

dayz,ff07cto,t3_er1q8x,1579465965.0,I've only found one Vaiga there since 1.06 release.  There's no weapons to be found with the current loot economy coupled with the current necessity for people to horde high tier weapons.
