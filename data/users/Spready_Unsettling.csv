ThatsInsane,ffbltd2,t1_ffbd0aw,1579771660.0,"No, best case scenario, and most likely scenario if you play your cards right, is that you use your superior intellect to simply scare off the wolves. It may sound stupid, but all animals have a threshold for intimidation, and all animals use intimidation to avoid getting into too many fights. If you stand your ground, look big, shout, and move slightly in their direction the second they give ground, you've broken their entire momentum, and basically convinced them that it's not worth it.

Besides that point, humans are far better fighters than wolves. For one thing, we can actually calculate strengths and weaknesses. For another, think about how few movements and directions a wolf actually has available. Now think about how many directions you could go in, or attacks you could perform in a single movement.

You can even see it in the video: every time the dog turns to face and intimidate them, they're completely stopped, even though they're three to one, and the dog is pathetically small and weak compared to them. The second the dog turns and runs away from them, they're chasing again."

LeopardsAteMyFace,fetfh1w,t1_ferpdy1,1579374927.0,"Shit, if you're not gonna correct your US elementary level of understanding, I'll pile on too. Franks, Saxons and Angles are *not* the same thing. One is a French ethnic group (which I believe is Celtic in origin) with centuries of history with Rome, and the two others are a German/Benelux ethnic group, and German/Danish ethnic group. The latter two were famously border states for the Roman empire, which means a great deal in terms of European history.

Besides that point, the other three major ethnic groups to colonize England were the Frisians (Dutch), Jutes and Danes (Danish). There were native Picts and Britons, as well as older Celtic colonizers. We know at least 2000 years of French history in pretty fine detail, and there has never really been a huge migration to or connectivity with Great Britain. It's even quite likely that the Normans in northern France had more in common with the British than the actual Franks, due to both people groups being germannic and sharing a language group.

As for WASP, we must assume that this means Scandinavia (at least up to the southern border of Lapland), Germany (pretty fucking huge, and also one of the biggest immigrant populations in the US), Benelux countries, and major swaths of Central and Eastern Europe.
