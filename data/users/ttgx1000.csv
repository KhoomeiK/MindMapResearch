unpopularopinion,ffhr1zt,t3_etl69w,1579949389.0,"Toxic masculinity is thus defined by adherence to traditional male gender roles that restrict the kinds of emotions allowable for boys and men to express, including social expectations that men seek to be dominant (the ""alpha male"") and limit their emotional range primarily to expressions of anger.

A toxic masculine can't express emotions or they're a pussy. They can't use womens shampoo otherwise they would clearly be a fag.  Someones talking to your girl? Better role up your sleeves, slam that beer and go kick their ass, and defend your pride. This is the kind of thinking that is toxic masculinity...

What you described as toxic femininity does not equate to the female version of toxic masculinity... 

You just described an asshole and assigned a gender to it."

pathofexile,fef0s84,t3_eol8c5,1579045494.0,"Why cant there just be an in game trading post that is comprised of the items from everyone's public tabs. Give everyone 1 free public tab that way new players can have it.... You wanna trade with players go to the in game AH, use victario as the npc. The AH has the same UI as poe.trade. in poe theme of course.


This way you cant get scammed because you buy the item from the AH, it is then removed from their stash and placed into the AH UI where the player who bought it can grab it and pull it into their inventory.

Not sure but I think I would love this approach as it keeps everything the way it is...and it makes buying items easy as hell because you can just use the npc in your hideout to buy from people."
