aww,fepcexz,t1_fep4y37,1579317095.0,"Well I was trying to be nice and maybe share some of my perspective, but maybe it was a waste of time. Oh well, some people just don’t care. No skin off my back - I wrote that on the john, lol. 

Here’s hoping this particular person matures, but if they don’t - it’s their loss, to be honest. Must suck to go through life with such a shitty attitude."
aww,fep15eh,t1_feozxhj,1579309816.0,"There is a lot more happening to you that you aren’t even aware of if you legitimately believe that it’s funny/cool to laugh at people with disabilities.  

I went through an ‘edgy’ phase as a teenager, I get it. But at a certain point, you see enough of the world to realize that other people (disabilities or not) are just trying to live their lives as happily/successfully as they know how. Your criticism/laughter is just emptiness, and while it may get a reaction (the thing you are looking for) the only person you are ultimately damaging is yourself. 

I doubt Shane cares one way or the other, he’s lived his whole life being treated like a disabled person and he has one of the best outlooks I’ve ever seen, he’s extremely smart and witty; he knows how to laugh at himself and life. Your comment isn’t even that funny to begin with, so I doubt it would even register with him.

Anyway, I don’t really have a point here; hopefully though you can see past the need to make a cheap joke at someone else’s expense and realize that we humans are all just bags of bone and meat and we are all each other have in the grand scheme of things. We’re all just trying to connect with someone else and find some kind of meaning in life. You’ll get much better results if you try and empathize instead of cutting other people down. Cheers."

Witcher was good (although it can be confusing to people unfamiliar with the source material) but I do feel there are better shows on Netflix."
