SGExams,ff2mq6s,t3_er8j3z,1579513666.0,"Hey do PM me if you need any help, I just started IB Year 2.

I sent this to a friend that needed help, this might help you.

\----

There are 6 groups of subjects you can choose from, and you must take a total of 6 subjects, all from different groups\*.

Group 1: Studies in Language and Literature

Group 2: Language Acquisition

Group 3: Individuals and Societies

Group 4: Experimental Sciences

Group 5: Mathematics

Group 6: The Arts

\*You don’t need to take a group 6 subject, instead you can replace a group 6 subject with a group 4 (or 3(if I’m not wrong))

There are Higher Level (HL) and Standard Level (SL) Subjects, and of your 6 subjects, 3 must be HL, and the other 3 SL. Some schools offer 4 HL subjects for you to take, but I don’t know much about that and honestly, don’t do that cause you might die.

This is my Subject combination:

Group 1: English Language and Literature (HL)  
Group 2: Chinese B (SL)  
Group 3: History (SL)  
Group 4: Chemistry (HL), Biology (HL)  
Group 5: Mathematics (SL)  
Group 6: -

As you can see, I don’t take a group 6 subject.  


(from what I have heard, IB’s HLs are easier than A-Level H2 subjects, but don’t  take my word for this as I don’t know A-levels.)  


The grading scheme of IB is from 1-7, contrary from O-levels, 1 is the worse score, 7 is the best. The top score you can get is 45, and to pass you need a 24 with 12 in your HLs. 3 points come from your Extended Essay, Theory of Knowledge and Creativity, Activity, Service. ( I will elaborate further)

Okay so lemme explain a bit more: (btw, when you join IB, some syllabus may have changed, so what I am saying is not accurate)

——

For ALL your subjects, you have Internal Assessments (IA) Written Assignments (for languages). Internal Assessments are quite ‘fun’ to do. They are marked internally by the school, but IB will pick a few from each school to mark and moderate. These papers take up 20-25% of your final grade, depending on whether they are your HLs or SLs.

English: 

You do two Written Assignments (WA) one of them is on one of the books/poems/play you do in school, you get to write and additional scene based on your understanding of the play, and your other WA is on something more technical, like how audiences will react to a advertisement etc…

There will be an Interactive Oral Commentary (IOC) 15% of grades, where you will choose a random text (out of the few that you learn in class) during an exam and give a 10 min breakdown of the extract, your English teacher will then ask 5 mins of questions. This is also internally assessed. (Honestly, English O-levels will not prepare you for this, it is insanely much harder. It might be easier if you took Lit during os I guess)  


There will be externally marked exams too, like you will sit for an exam at the end of your two years, they take up the rest of your marks.  


Chinese:

 (lemme just say Chinese B SL is ridiculously easy (Primary school standard Chinese? Just do a few revision papers and you will get a 7. I took this as an anticipated subject and got a 7!)

You do 1 WA, based on a topic choose in class, you will also have an IOC, but since it is Chinese B, you don’t learn any texts, so it will be on a picture.

The exams are 2 papers, one is an essay one is a mcq/comprehension. The downside is that you don’t get to use a dictionary for your essay, but just learn a few words or learn how to paraphrase and tada, you get a great score.

History:

Your IA will be about something that happened at least 10 years ago, and you research loads about it and basically answer your research question. You get to do anything you like. It is fun but you will want to pull out your hair while you research and find books in the library. 

You will have one paper on various sources and it is just like social studies section a, just remember the format. Paper 2 is an essay on content.

Chemistry:

Your IA can be on anything related to chemistry, but you will have to conduct experiments and collect results before submitting a less Than 12 page research paper on it.

You will have 2 papers, 1 MCQ, 1 open-ended.

Chemistry HL is REALLY HARD.

Biology:

Your IA can be on anything related to Biology, but you will have to conduct experiments and collect results before submitting a less Than 12 page research paper on it.

You will have 2 papers, 1 MCQ, 1 open-ended.  
Biology HL is not very hard, but content heavy.

Math:

Math IA can be on anything related to math, you don’t need to conduct experiments, but you can. You can do computer modelling etc… Again a less than 12 page research paper.

You will have 2 papers, 1 with calculator, 1 without.

Math SL is pretty much O-level A-math with some additional stuff, pretty easy once you get it. I took a-math and failed it hilariously, but I’m doing fine in math now. (Don’t take HL math, it is way too hard, and not very useful unless you want to go into a uni course that requires it. Math Studies is very easy, people that take it usually want to do something related to art in the future)

———

Okay so there are 3 other things in the IB programme that is very important, they contribute to your 3 extra points.

Extended Essay (EE)

A 4000 word research paper/ essay on one of your HL subjects.

I am doing mine on Biology, and have spent more than 100 hours in the lab/ at home conducting the experiment, and several more hours sitting in front of my computer researching (and trying not to pull out my hair). To say that EE is a fun process is basically a lie. It is not fun, it has caused me and my friend to have mental breakdowns because of the fear of it not working out. But I recently finished all experiments and have submitted a draft to my supervisor, and it is highly rewarding. Your IAs and EEs are what differ you from a A-Level student. This helps you immensely in university when you have to write a research paper. All EEs are hard, so there is no easy way out (you can’t just pick a easy subject).

Theory of Knowledge (TOK)

Basically philosophy, and makes you think about everything in the world in another perspective.

There is a presentation which you can give in a group/ alone.

2 people - 20 mins

1 person - 10 mins

There is also an essay (I don’t know a lot about this because we have not started working on it)

Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS)

Basically VIA hours, but you must fulfil the requirements.

The school most likely will take you on a overseas trip for you to do volunteering. You pay a subsidised fee for the trip. It is very fun and rewarding. I went to a orphanage in Malaysia and helped paint walls, teach children stuff etc…

You have to write reflections on everything you do for CAS.

——

You will need a laptop for school (bring to school daily), and know how how to use word, excel etc…

Personally, I find IB prepares you for the working world better. My brother took A-levels in 2013 (I think) and he did really well, but he said that writing essays for University was pretty hard, so I think, IB is better than A-levels as it make you a critical thinker with all that massive research for your IAs and EEs.

Yes you will go through immense stress even though you planned your time well (sleeping at 2-3am occasionally is not uncommon), but like I said, you will feel accomplished."
