weed,fg0mtq0,t3_ew9ydv,1580410956.0,Well done. It’s great.
microgrowery,fg0meh3,t3_ew9sih,1580410710.0,Move the fan a bit. My plants seem to dislike heavy air movement. It can cause some damage to your leaves.
microgrowery,fg0lpva,t1_fg0dyet,1580410324.0,You shouldn’t grow in clear containers. Sunlight can damage new root growth.
aww,fg0g4b8,t1_fg03jip,1580407089.0,"Munchkins are a naturally occurring mutation that does not affect most animals in any way. They are simply cats with short legs.
Edit:  there are some bone and spine issues which some cats develop but for the most part they can live 12-15 years, many with no health issues."

canadients,ffs919q,t1_ffrb4hs,1580176108.0,Wouldn’t it be fun if it was suddenly totally legal and local growers could sell on the open market. The LP’s would seriously have to step up their game. Lol.
canadients,ffs8qoi,t1_ffrcpyo,1580175905.0,Never seen keif less than flower.

weed,ffjp5k7,t1_ffjomb3,1580003459.0,Thank you. I would love one. Are you going to start producing them for sale?
microgrowery,ffjc2zo,t1_ffjblqs,1579995161.0,I’m not a scientist but you would think by the way folks talk it’s a scientific project. Pot is fun and the minute I stop learning or stop having fun I’ll quit.   Take care and enjoy yourself.
microgrowery,ffjb7es,t1_ffjb3pg,1579994641.0,You could drown in all the info. I try to keep things simple.
microgrowery,ffjb0iz,t1_ffjawsm,1579994527.0,Lots of practice.
microgrowery,ffjaj66,t1_ffja8xc,1579994255.0,"Ok. Caught me by surprise. When I comment on something I try to be constructive and honest. I’ve been growing for a long while and it makes me feel bad when I see things go wrong for others. I’ve lived through so many “problems” growing, I like to help if I can."
microgrowery,ffja345,t1_ffj7sj1,1579993966.0,Sorry but I wasn’t being negative. Sometimes bad things happen. I was just saying what I thought might be the problem. I’m a tad offended. Disgust is pretty strong.
aww,ffj6g9f,t3_etv2kl,1579991592.0,Soooo cute.
weed,ffj6ezx,t3_etuwlz,1579991567.0,Don’t spit on the joint. Every time I get passed a soggy joint it’s gross. And when rolling don’t put the joint in your mouth and wet it down to slow the burn. Also gross.
microgrowery,ffj5ncf,t1_fficer3,1579991014.0,"I’m not sure this one actually recovered. If the stem was bent or squashed it can’t uptake nutrients so it feeds off itself until there is no more to use. IF this is the case, it won’t come back."
weed,ffixjo9,t3_etsnn9,1579985159.0,And so the saga begins. A life long trip starts with a single joint. Have fun.
microgrowery,ffix3xu,t1_ffiwytp,1579984843.0,Absolutely. I’ve grown for years but I started just like you. Go natural and then slowly figure out what it likes and doesn’t like.   Have fun.
weed,ffiwhej,t3_etoilj,1579984392.0,It’s fabulous. Is the ceramic porous? Will it absorb some of the oils?
microgrowery,ffiwcqe,t1_ffipy3x,1579984298.0,"It’s not out of reach. If you’ve got it dialed in now, it will continue to grow. Trim off some of the dead leaves and carry on."

aww,ffivbas,t1_ffiv6el,1579983589.0,I’m weak. I don’t know if I could resist.

microgrowery,ffiu42s,t1_ffhyzv1,1579982765.0,I grow autos and top them all the time. They are tougher than you think.   I treat them very similar to phenols but in a compressed amount of time.
aww,ffijnvo,t3_etocc3,1579975465.0,I was waiting for him to pickup and cuddle the baby.
canadients,fffryk3,t1_ffdfazx,1579890501.0,There is a drying process when making good gummies. They need to be stood up on end for two days and then laid flat for a day. Then they will have a chewy texture that’s not to soft.
aww,fffmra1,t3_et7o0i,1579887309.0,Look at the white teeth. This pup looks wonderful.
weed,ffb0mrr,t1_ff9oh9u,1579748865.0,Oh so sorry. I was speaking in a generalized way. Was it? Lol
canadients,ffb0hnb,t1_ffa77gh,1579748769.0,"But at the same time another layer of tarnish is taken. It’s like peeling an onion. A very short while ago the idea of asking the province wouldn’t have come up because the idea wasn’t acceptable. Then there was a dispensary running unencumbered or policed. Then it’s legalized. Although they have stumbled in the presentation. Every time another layer of government actually becomes accepting even as a political ploy it will test the hold the feds have on it until it releases the choke hold they have on the industry and pot is really truly legal, tradable, acceptable.   Someday."
aww,ff9h9x7,t3_es8g3v,1579712991.0,My arms fell off a quarter of the way through the video. A job well done.

weed,fevombg,t3_eqj7e0,1579399723.0,4 out of 10 for style   Points deducted for putting hand on the ice. Lol
Awwducational,fevno8r,t1_fevmpmz,1579399430.0,That’s sad. One of the stronger breeds and they get messed up. Great dogs. We got boo when we saw him dumped out of a car on the highway and they just drove away. He chased them for two kilometers till we caught up to him and could get to him. It was hard to drive with tears pouring down my face. I wanted to catch and kill those people. He was a great dog with no bad habits. Just lots of energy.
Awwducational,fevixyb,t1_feuslpj,1579397961.0,"Agreed, BC’s never stop. When my vet said this, I’m pretty sure he was referring in general.   He was also staring at a bloody mess. We had no further injuries when they were removed."
Awwducational,feuqj43,t1_feuocxl,1579389010.0,Thank you that was very interesting. It was our vet who told us.  Boos dew claws were always getting caught. They sort of dangled off his leg. He was stitched up 5 times to stop the bleeding. I’ve never removed them from my other dogs. Boo was a highly athletic Border Collie and it was an issue for him.
weed,fely4x1,t1_felcjr7,1579233907.0,"Details man, details. Lol. What ratio?"

aww,fe02eim,t1_fe01ost,1578801365.0,The low class criminals breed for aggression and a large part of the breeding pool is contaminated by it. You need to know exactly where the dog came from and make sure you get from the most reputable breeder. I’m an owner of Akita’s and I don’t leave them with small children. They love kids!  Intelligent caution has to be applied when young children are around. I love and trust my dogs but they are not 100% trustworthy 100% of the time.
microgrowery,fdzsj0g,t1_fdzrnl5,1578794768.0,Does it disappear or are the leaves always stained from it?   Your name is a wee bit terrifying.
microgrowery,fdzo2c9,t1_fdzjefn,1578792299.0,Wow. Does it stay on the leaves or?

Awwducational,fdz6m54,t1_fdz5d08,1578787186.0,Ear cropping has no value with the exception of fighting dogs. A truly barbaric and cruel display of human ignorance. I have never heard removing the dew claw was a negative. Our mutt was in the vets several times because she would snag it on things and tear the skin. We did eventually have them removed. They are like a holdover and serve no purpose now similar to our tail bones.

outdoorgrowing,fds1k6k,t1_fdq41e7,1578692950.0,It’s a bit difficult to overwater in ground plants unless it rains for 40 days and 40 nights but it’s highly unlikely a problem.   30 degree plus. It needs most the water it gets. Yellow leaves are sometimes just that. Yellow leaves. Rest of your plant looks robust. Try feeding every second watering.

We don’t spray with any poisons. Every little bit helps the environment. Besides, I really like bees and hummingbirds and having them in the garden.
