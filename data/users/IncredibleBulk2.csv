This is what I'm sensing too. You might be giving the impression that you want to get serious quickly. Thursday to Monday is a pretty short turn around time and you were on the phone for several hours between those dates? That's a lot of rushed intimacy. 

I also want to address this: 

>  I'm reasonably attractive and the people I'm trying to date are also in that reasonable attractive area, you could see us together in the street and be like that makes sense 

This is way too limiting of a way to think about meaningful human relationships. Strong relationships involve aspects besides two attractive individuals. This makes me wonder if you are getting to know these women in a well-rounded way. Are you taking interest in their lives or learning how they see the world? Are you evaluating whether you are compatible based on other factors than level of attractiveness?"
