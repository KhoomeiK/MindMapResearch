Advice,fg1tyoy,t3_en063k,1580433172.0,"My brothers a marine. It was really hard on my family when he first left to boot camp, and honestly, it doesn’t get a whole lot easier. It’s scary, sad, and just sucky, but more than any of that my family is incredibly proud and happy for him. He’s doing what he loves right now and has made some incredible friends. You just need to be honest, don’t lie, don’t sugar coat, just tell the truth and let it sink in. She’ll probably be mad and cry, my mom was pretty upset when the recruiter showed up at our house, but be patient and be supportive. The most important thing is, though, that if you really value this choice and want to do it, do it."
AmItheAsshole,fg1pa07,t3_eszvls,1580431209.0,"YTA, but kinda. Salads are side dishes, maybe during lunch a salad could work for the main course, but not for dinner. I’m no vegan, and love meat, but I know that there are lots and lots of vegan foods that are really tasty and much more fitting as dinner main courses and are very easy and accessible. Though, if you didn’t know, you didn’t know. Just learn from the experience, apologize, and move on. It’s not that big of a deal after all. If you really were being low effort though, then, idk, that’s pretty lame, but it really just seems like you just didn’t know that wasn’t the most acceptable of meal choices."
AmItheAsshole,fg1nv58,t3_ev4r6c,1580430501.0,"YTA. First, babysitting sucks and I would absolutely pay someone who babysat my kid. Second, you definitely seem to have a bias against Samantha and seem to be using it as an excuse against your daughter not having done the ‘crime.’ It’s possible your daughter could have done it, and you should have looked into a bit more. Third, why would you leave your very young kid with a supposedly unruly brat? I don’t know, seems like a bad idea from the start."
