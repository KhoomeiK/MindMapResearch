It definitely has been rare this season."
rupaulsdragrace,ffvy54p,t1_ffvy0vq,1580276916.0,"Ugh that is gross, I hadn’t seen her say that and also thought it was much longer ago that she’d expressed anti-vax views (I also thought all she’d ever said was the “it’s so polarizing” thing which is not a great look still, but yeah). She probably is keeping quiet and does still feel that way then. Very disappointing."
rupaulsdragrace,ffvxrsf,t1_ffvxki5,1580276566.0,"I don’t have anything concrete either, sadly - however, she’s gone from wanting to cure her daughter’s depression with nuts to acknowledging that she benefits from actual medication. So my hope is that her view here has evolved too."
Showerthoughts,ffvxkxn,t1_ffvsp7l,1580276386.0,"Same, but also in most YouTube makeup tutorials I’ve seen, the person looks crazy after just putting foundation on. I think you need to be good at the next steps too, which I am not lol"

theLword,ffv8fvs,t3_ev2elm,1580258161.0,"I totally agree with this!! Especially after they gave Rapinoe so much time, as others have said. If they wanted the interruption to happen, they should’ve given Roxane more time first on the show so we could actually hear from her first. Lord knows they could’ve cut a minute out of the airport running at the end lol"
theLword,ffv84aj,t3_evbcx0,1580257946.0,"I think I have to see them as two separate things - otherwise, yes, I would feel like Gen Q paled in comparison to the original, which felt so exciting. But I was also “coming of age” as an adult then, which had something to do with it. But I think the main thing missing from Gen Q is the friend interaction. That always resonated with me even more than the relationship stuff in the OG series. That cast had magic."

LifeProTips,ffsbzrg,t3_euwhhc,1580178098.0,"I couldn’t agree more, yet I still find it hard to break the habit. It’s “just” so ingrained, especially in women. (I’m also trying to cut back on saying “I feel like...” when what I really mean is “I think that...”)"
workinprogressSho,ffsbogr,t1_ffsbfek,1580177889.0,"SO many feelings! Enjoy the finale, it leaves a lot to discuss!! I’m so happy that there’s a season 2 coming and that there’s a little place to discuss it here :)"
