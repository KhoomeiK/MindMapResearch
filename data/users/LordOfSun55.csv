physicsmemes,ffbo4df,t1_ffbhb8d,1579775188.0,"Holy shit, I think I just had a TIL moment. *That's* why objects gain mass when approaching the speed of light - because by accelerating, they're gaining *energy*, and mass is a measure of energy!  
  
We just can't observe this effect at non-relativistic speeds because just like time dilation and lenght contraction, the effect is too miniscule to even measure in any way.  
  
Makes you wonder - if the speed of light was much slower, would a baseball get heavier as you throw it? Sounds like an XKCD *What if?* scenario."

cute,ff94y1j,t1_ff8uh59,1579704943.0,"I dunno, that looks like a hognose. Hognoses aren't constrictors, since they actually *do* have venom (although it's too weak to hurt a human and they rarely bite you anyway), so I don't really get what he's doing. ""His best"" would be my best guess."
ItemShop,ff93orx,t1_ff922fj,1579704076.0,"Looks like a hognose. Supposedly quite docile, they actually have a tendency to play dead instead of biting you if you spook one in the wild. Venomous, but their venom is too weak to hurt you unless you get an allergic reaction, but even then, they rarely bite.  
  
Sounds like they make fairly good pets."

You *can* choose to hear only what you want to hear and ignore the rest, but that doesn't make the rest go away. It's still there, and eventually, it's gonna bite you in the ass.  
  
Shocked that you no longer get to sit at the table after you leave the club? Tough shit, should've thought of that before. Anyone with half a brain and a basic understanding of causality would have.

writing,ff40aye,t3_erfrik,1579552751.0,"I think I heard someone say once that when it comes to writing, there are no ""good"" or ""bad"" ideas - it all depends on how you pull them off. What looks like a bad idea can be great if it's well executed, while what looks like a good idea can fail miserably if the execution is lacking. Naturally, some things can be harder than others to pull off well, but that doesn't mean you can't make them work.

As for your idea, you can try to go down the ""the journey was more important than the destination"" route - make the journey still be worthwhile because the characters gained something from it, grew and learned from the experience, and maybe now, when going to Place B didn't work out, they can look back at Place A and realize that, maybe, they can make this work, because they're stronger now or because they always were stronger than they thought."
