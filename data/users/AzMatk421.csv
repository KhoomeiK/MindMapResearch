EscapefromTarkov,ffbyaok,t3_esrzih,1579786627.0,"Hi. This game looks amazing. But I have a couple questions if you don’t mind. First, how is the player base in North America? Easy to find games to join? And second, is the game downloadable on any of the sites like gog or steam. Thank you in advance!"
guns,ff7hxgm,t3_es0l20,1579649954.0,Looks like Shooters world? I was there the other day and put 2 boxes through it. Easy to shoot and accurate. Looking forward to picking one up.

sciencefiction,fevbytd,t3_eqj9wa,1579395588.0,"Great comic! It was recently rereleased (couple years ago) I think with some new material. I could be wrong about it being new material, but it was very enjoyable reading."

Justfuckmyshitup,femv8h2,t1_fem1b7q,1579270506.0,Your link is probably the best thing that is going to happen to his “career”.
todayilearned,femucif,t1_femt17f,1579269827.0,"Just a thought. And I’m not trying to pretend I’m smart or anything. I think it’s pretty amazing that without this handful of people who are experts in this language this knowledge would be lost. But on the other hand, if so few people are experts, is it worth it? Thank you for reading and replying (if you do :))"

guns,fdpnhrx,t1_fdp3dcg,1578633731.0,"Post apocalyptic. Very formulaic men’s adventure stuff but entertaining. I listen to the audiobooks published by graphic audio. Great production, excellent voice acting."
guns,fdoqpr3,t3_em66v2,1578610767.0,Always equate this gun with the Deathlands series. Doc Tanner’s weapon of choice.

You will experience every emotion during treatment and it’s ok to express every single one. My heart goes out to your boy. I wish you all best. Keep fighting.

nursing,fcfxopn,t3_eh7390,1577634689.0,This isn’t bullying. This isn’t even worth being upset about.
