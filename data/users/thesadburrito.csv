Bootstrap can be great if you import just what you need. Their utility classes are good, their latest grid is good too.  

As for the jQuery, you can easily swap out for Bootstrap.Native, which is a vanilla implementation of bootstrap. With that you can also bundle only the js you need. 

So you can use the bootstrap grid and modal and utility classes and use everything else custom.

Hopefully Bootstrap 5 is more modular.  That's where the benefit will be. If you want a quick modal or a quick grid, or popovers right out of the gate, it is very useful."
