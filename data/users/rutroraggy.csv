What specific policies can you name that the self described ""socialist"" Bernie Sanders has proposed that is socialism in your definition? Explain that please. As for your private schools claim the statistics and context change wildly by region so there is no point debating it, nor is it relevant to the original argument which is apparently the definition of what socialism is in current American politics.
