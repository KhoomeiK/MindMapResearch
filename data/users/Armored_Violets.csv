Undertale,ffcndve,t1_ffbvo8a,1579803144.0,">I haven’t played genocide yet, but I want to just so I can experience the whole game, I still love the characters and the story to it, but I want to have that sense of accomplishment of seeing every route.

Well, the Genocide run is *literally* made for people with that mindset, so... (try to) have fun!"
BetterEveryLoop,ffcn7y2,t1_ffck8np,1579803040.0,"Evanescence was great. I still think Lithium is a beautiful song (and clip) despite the ""edginess""."
wholesomememes,ffcg1nf,t1_ffbhtkt,1579798678.0,"Honestly I think I'll keep this thread saved and read it time and time again when I begin (negatively) second guessing myself again. I really didn't expect to gain this much help and insight from a couple downer comments my depressed ass needed to vent... If I wasn't so dead inside I'm sure I'd have tears as well haha. Thank you for the sympathy, friend. It's hard to believe that I'm not alone some days, but this thread is quite the evidence!"
wholesomememes,ffcfez1,t1_ffbinhl,1579798292.0,"I see... so instead of thinking I'm lying to myself I can try to recognize that what I'm feeling is wrong, it's negatively influenced by where I'm at right now. Okay, I think I can get on board with that. It feels easier, and weirdly comforting, to have a clear target to ""antagonize"", in a way. Like something I can fall back on when I start second guessing myself. So I think telling myself what I did was good is silly? Well, that's my dork brain trying to keep me down because that's what's comfortable. Like you said I just can't blindly trust what I'm feeling - I guess I was doing that without realizing. Thanks."
wholesomememes,ffb8mpc,t1_ffasbp3,1579755159.0,"You have a good point, and thank you for the help, I'm trying to connect with the ideas being replied. But here's the thing about ""today's progress was good"": I rarely feel that way. I guess seeing little things as ""good progress"" is what bothers me... I guess it shouldn't, but I'll have to do some work to accept that."
wholesomememes,ffb86s6,t1_ffaurr3,1579754659.0,"Goddamn, have you actually met me or something? I guess my issues are just not as uncommon as I thought, which is a very good thing haha. I guess part of the issue is that I'm not accepting this is where I am right now, whether I want it or not. And part of *that* is because I've been in a hole for a couple years now, which is extremely frustrating... but yeah. You're right. Thank you."
wholesomememes,ffb7ww6,t1_ffaykr6,1579754400.0,"For sure... that's actually very relevant for me right now. The more I read these replies, including yours, the more it makes sense. Thank you very much for taking the time to help. Of course I'm not saying everything's fixed, far from it, but these different perspectives do make sense and give me hope."
wholesomememes,ffb7qlr,t1_ffb1ahm,1579754211.0,I'll take a look. Thank you.
roguelikes,ffaozzi,t1_ffamuz5,1579741109.0,"Roguelites are what you're looking for, friend. I love both roguelikes and roguelites, so I recommend both. But they're quite different for sure. Maybe give some roguelikes a try when you feel you need a break from the lites? rlikes are a bit rough to get into, but once you do, there's a world of possibilities. Very deep games."
wholesomememes,ffao1gz,t1_ffalfgw,1579740464.0,"No, don't worry, I see what you're saying. It does make sense. I'll try to adopt that mindset. It's just that I'm having a particularly bad new year so far, so it's hard for me to put things in perspective. But I do think you're right."
wholesomememes,ffal8q3,t1_ffakxtf,1579738556.0,"You see, that's where it starts entering sugar coating territory to me. It feels like I'm treating myself like a toddler. I hate that.

Edit: thank you very much to everyone replying and trying to help. At the very least you all have given me a bit of much needed hope."
wholesomememes,ffakpcp,t1_ffak4d0,1579738161.0,"That does make sense. Thank you for the insight. I think today I'm feeling too exhausted to try and ""force"" my thoughts like that... but I'll try and keep it in mind for the days to come. I've been told similar things before, but it's really difficult for me to break that ""cycle"", if I can put it that way. I'll try to remember that it's not about lying but changing how my brain works for my own benefit."
