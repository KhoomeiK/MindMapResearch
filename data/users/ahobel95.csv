mildlyinteresting,ffp3xca,t3_eucakq,1580085666.0,But how do I put a lime in it??
ShouldIbuythisgame,ffo7x7a,t3_eube49,1580074983.0,"It's a super stressful title! If you're looking for a shooter you can just jump right into, no bueno.

It's incredibly complex, all of the gun modifications have zero explanation, so you end up in the wiki trying to figure out how shit fits together.

The combat is intense! All of the audio is designed around how itd be in real life. If you are shot from behind for instance, you'll hear the loud crack of the bullet fly by your head as if the sound came 90 degrees to the actual shot. You have to listen after for the boom from the gun and then find your target. It's very difficult! 

I personally love the game, but it has definitely caused me to rage way too many times! If you have any doubts, get the cheapest variant. If you love it, I'd say go for the Edge of Darkness edition when it's on sale. It is expensive, but the expanded storage slots and 3x3 Omega Box is totally worth it for the power player."
ShouldIbuythisgame,ffo6g5b,t3_eu8nof,1580074597.0,"So heres the differences starting from most glaring down to minute:

Java and Bedrock Edition (Windows 10, console, mobile) are incompatible with multiplayer. Bedrock can play with literally anyone else playing Bedrock. So someone on mobile can link up on Xbox can link up to a Windows 10 player.

Java has way more mod support. Bedrock has mods, but you need to pay for them through their microtransactions store. I'm not sure if their is a way to inject them manually or not

The overall features are very similar, but their are differences,

Java has way more capabilities when it comes to graphics and rendering. You can see wayyyy further in Java to the detriment of your frames. Bedrock stays rock steady at 144 FPS for me, but draw distance is super limited.

The spawning mechanism for mobs is also entirely different. Without getting too deep into details, Bedrock edition makes it damn near impossible for a mob farm to exist. Java on the other hand is super easy to build a mob farm.

The last thing that I can think of is redstone. The redstone mechanics in Bedrock behave erratically at the complex end of things. It's also hard to explain, but essentially Java is entirely more stable when it comes to redstone contraptions. 


I personally suggest Java, there is just a ton more opportunity playing on big servers and the like. 

I'd only suggest Bedrock if you have no friends that play PC. I personally have both, Java to play with my long term friends that I've played with since 2012, and Bedrock to play with family that can only play locally on mobile."
ShouldIbuythisgame,ffo4dsg,t3_eu90u4,1580074022.0,"I know you mentioned Minecraft, but there is limitless potential in that game for aesthetics. The game is blocky, but the way the game plays helps remedy that blockiness.

As for a really deeply aesthetic game, try Planet Coaster! You can get stupid specific with you buildings. I'd say look up some tutorials on how to get build detailed stuff! I saw one guy on youtube spend more than an hour designing a flower pot with in-game vanilla scenery items that he shrunk down. I'd also say look up the 4 meter smoothing technique for the actual rollercoasters if you are super into the meticulous side of aesthetics! The 4 meter smoothing technique can take hours, but itll make your coaster absolutely perfectly buttery smooth."

pics,feuuxru,t1_fesiwt7,1579390212.0,I learned recently the quiet is from the snow itself! It's so loosely packed that it kills most sound waves that hit it. So that's why it's so eerily quiet after a snowfall!
science,fejr5dk,t1_fej1azr,1579183775.0,"On the flip side of this, here in Las Vegas our hottest summer day last year was about 8 degrees cooler than year's previous. I mean, it was still 116 F, but it wasnt 124 like the year before. And this winter has been just as cold as the previous year. 

Then again, we are coming out of a 20 year drought, so the climate is definitely changing.

The thing about global warming is that it's not just an increase in temperature globally. It's also going to cause much more extremes in temperature. The summers are already hotter, but the winters should also tend to get colder. It's a dynamic instability(larger peak temps) caused by an overall static instability(increasing average.) So this winter and summer here in Vegas is a bit of an anomaly compared to what is expected. In places like you're describing is a bit anomalous too! I know in Indiana(my birth state) temps and weather were fairly average for winter. I went back in early december and we got nearly 10 inches of snow while the temps stayed in the mid 20s to low 10s.

I'm not saying your point is inaccurate, weather is definitely changing. Some places are seeing more effect than others. Itll be interesting to see the peak of seasons in the coming decade."

So it very well could have been imminent. The fact it took 7 months for an ""imminent"" attack actually tells me there very well may have been. If I knew of the man's whereabouts months ago and was just gonna lie about an imminent attack, I'd have done it within the week."

AskMen,fe5uamc,t3_enlczz,1578875098.0,"I was friends with this absolutely gorgeous girl back in High School. She had shot me down once, but hinted at just not being ready. I stayed the course and just became great friends with her. She started hitting on me super hard, so I obviously took the bait and started talking with her a ton. We would go out on ""dates"" and hang out all the time. It was great! Then when I finally had the balls to get over the initial rejection, I asked her out again. She awkwardly told me no and that she honestly just liked the attention I gave her where there was no man in her life. That pissed me off that she led me on so hard for so long on purpose no less, so I cold-turkeyed her. I told her I needed to get myself re-oriented and that we should stop talking for a bit. About a year later we ended up bumping into each other and making up. I explicitly told her I didnt want to talk too much or too often because of how easy it was between us. She agreed, and we've been friends ever since! I have to control the amount I talk to her because I know for a fact she will try to lead me on again if she needs to. It's not necessarily anything on her, that's her personality and we have to manage that in our friendship without overstepping bounds."
