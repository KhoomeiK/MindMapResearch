You do realize there could be more detailed and verifiable information the books, right?  
 
  
  
You're only taking it with skepticism because some guy on the Internet said it was fake news.   

  
[Whittemore is officially recognized as a state hero of Massachusetts and has his own official day (Feburary 3rd)](https://web.archive.org/web/20070929123454/http://www.mass.gov/legis/bills/senate/st01/st01839.htm) but I'm sure that's not good enough for you either and you should also be completely skeptical of that too.  
 
lol, whatever, I'm done here."

And anyways all modern history is being added to Wikipedia as it happens. It is very much a historical record."
nonononoyes,fgmzw92,t1_fgmyi71,1580935068.0,And? Did you read the books? Or are you just assuming they're a bunch of lies because someone said fake news on the Internet?
swtor,fgmw50v,t1_fgmvqi6,1580933167.0,Ahh gotcha thanks

nonononoyes,fgmpbve,t1_fgmk37z,1580929298.0," >“On April 19, 1775, British forces were returning to Boston from the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the opening engagements of the war. On their march they were continually shot at by American militiamen.

>Whittemore was in his fields when he spotted an approaching British relief brigade under Earl Percy, sent to assist the retreat. Whittemore loaded his musket and ambushed the British Grenadiers of the 47th Regiment of Foot from behind a nearby stone wall, killing one soldier. He then drew his dueling pistols, killed a second grenadier and mortally wounded a third. By the time Whittemore had fired his third shot, a British detachment had reached his position; Whittemore drew his sword and attacked.He was subsequently shot in the face, bayoneted numerous times, and left for dead in a pool of blood. He was found by colonial forces, trying to load his musket to resume the fight. He was taken to Dr. Cotton Tufts of Medford, who perceived no hope for his survival. However, Whittemore recovered and lived another 18 years until dying of natural causes at the age of 98.”

*edit: Ok you people can go argue with Massachusetts if you think this guy is just lying. Massachusetts named him an official state hero of Massachusetts and has made Feburary 3rd a day of rememberence for him.

PrequelMemes,fgmmlxp,t1_fglte27,1580927673.0,The screech was actually a [Force Scream](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Force_scream) but the movie doesn't do a good job of showing the effects of it
