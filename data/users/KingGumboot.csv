newzealand,feltzg7,t3_epq9c6,1579230886.0,"I didn't realise that prices can differ between stores until I moved across to the other side of Lower Hutt and started ordering from a different Dominos. Now I get marketing emails from both and the deals are always a dollar or two cheaper at the one closer to me.

Worth comparing different stores if you're in range of a couple!"

AskReddit,felplx8,t1_fel096i,1579227854.0,"> And I'm surprised that the whole building/time travel to make changes hasn't been done anywhere else (or has it?).

Surely it's been done in other games by now. Ratchet and Clank: A Crack in Time had a couple of levels with a similar concept where you had to go back and forward in time to change things in order to progress"
newzealand,feljz1w,t1_felillh,1579223998.0,"Maybe if it was something like discrimination (""we're kicking you out because you're gay"") you'd have a case but aside from that I don't think there's anything you can do about it. That's the trade-off of being a flatmate as opposed to a tenant, you have pretty much no liability but pretty much no rights. You can have a flatmate agreement/contract but I don't think it's common for people to actually do that"
newzealand,feligkc,t1_feld57l,1579222951.0,"> And if she has a brain she will sue you when you kick her out over it.

No she won't, because if she's not actually a tenant then they're allowed to kick her out at short notice for any reason"
newzealand,feli9e7,t1_felhb29,1579222812.0,"Sounds like the most likely situation here is a relationship broke up, so one person left but there isn't actually a space to fill"

Fitness,felgth5,t1_felf6kl,1579221834.0,"Doesn't matter. When I was on PHUL I never had a strict schedule, doing all 4 days back to back isn't ideal but I did it sometimes when other things got in the way"
Wellington,fele4qh,t1_fel6v9h,1579220041.0,"Practising for another 12 days is pretty unnecessary if you've already got it down, just do a few more practice tests in the last couple of days before the actual test"

Wellington,fela241,t1_fel84as,1579217355.0,"I'd usually need to log in, but also it's rare that anything is particularly urgent so if it's something that can't be solved on the phone it'll probably just be a case of ""sure, I'll send you an email later today with [an answer/that report/whatever]"""

Studies have clearly proven this to be false."
Wellington,fel33sp,t1_fel1iuj,1579213016.0,"4x8, and yeah we've all been reading the case studies from the likes of Perpetual Guardian. 

The workload is definitely manageable in less time, the main challenge will be our clients and making sure they don't feel like our customer service is lacking with being closed for a day. Most likely we'll have to at least be available for phonecalls on Fridays in case anyone needs us.

4x10 is a good alternative for people that can't realistically go down to 4x8, however in our case I think that would make things worse... 10 hours is a long time to be sitting in an office"
Wellington,fel2t7b,t1_fel1gkv,1579212835.0,"Definitely, we'll probably have great results for the first couple of months but it'll be 6 months or so down the track that we find out if it's really working or not. The threat of returning to a 5 day week might keep us focused!"
