I like to desaturate one color and very slightly boost a second. Since this photo was likely already just reds and blues I don't know what I'd do, maybe desat blues around the person so that the white cloths came out white even in shadow. I'd also set the white balance using a region of the person's gown. 

Would be fun to just mess with the raw tbqh. We all have our own ways of editing photos and stylistically i can see this photo as good.

Cloud9,fg8ervm,t1_fg8e4s2,1580617358.0,"Sneaky exerts a ton of pressure on his own, often playing a bit too loose and heady leading to getting caught, Zeyzal started out pretty good but somehow became a pressure drain.

More likely that for the kid to feel like he can respond that way is because he constantly feels the sting of leather. Abuse breeds shitheads not the other way around."
