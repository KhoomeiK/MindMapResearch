SelfAwarewolves,fffn38q,t3_et4873,1579887511.0,Is that really trending? Good lord feminists are out of control. 100% If you hashtagged something insulting a female trope bitches would lose their fucking minds.
unpopularopinion,fffmlh5,t3_et9m99,1579887209.0,I like a chick with a face that's a little busted. They're usually much cooler to date than some super vapid cunt. I like small tits too. And fake titties are a deal breaker. They look to weird to me and it kills my boner.

gaming,ffb6n3q,t1_ffavame,1579753210.0,"I have to disagree on this point. You can pay $60 to play, but you don't get to have any of the coolest looking shit. What? Nah, pass. I'll spend my money elsewhere. 

Edit: FTP can do that all day, I have no problem with that."

gaming,ffb5y7x,t3_esmbn5,1579752674.0,"I have zero problems with free games selling shit, but when I already paid $60 for the game, $20 for the first dlc, $30 for the second, $60 for the third and another $60 for the fourth, you can shove micro transactions right up your ass. And then lock all the good cosmetics behind paywalls? Yeah Destiny, I won't be seeing you next season. I'm $230 into your game and this is how you treat us? Ouch man, that really hurt."

xboxone,ff990l0,t1_ff933qc,1579707620.0,"Yes, exactly. It feels like it could have been game of the year, 10 years ago. Even my buddy I play with every now and then saw that I was playing it and asked how I liked it. I said okay, it was a bit slow. He said he agreed and then at the same time we were like fallout, yeah, totally fallout. I legit thought it was made by Bethesda."
DIY,ff951kv,t1_ff94jpk,1579705011.0,"Really? I was talking about the balance. The last time I played a game with an actual shifter was decades ago in an arcade, and they had no clutch. So I was wondering, since that shifter is clearly for a manual, if they, by now, had actually come ouy with games that incorporated a clutch and if you actually had to balance the two. But you're telling me they have clutch controllers that actually feel real?"
