worldnews,ffl0loi,t1_ffkxjdd,1580032601.0,">You are not a scientist not an Economist, are you? Serious question. 

I have degrees in chemical engineering and philosophy, so I'm more scientifically and logically literate than you if we're simply going by credentials. 

Which is fallacious reasoning in of itself, but you seem to only care about what letters are next to someone's name, not the content of their arguments, at least not enough to understand them sufficiently to defend or criticize them in a productive manner.

> Scientific debate is centered around research. This research must be peer-reviewed and published. This has nothing to do with an argument from authority as you understand it.

It's centered around *critical examination of observations*.

>in scientific debate it would now be up to you to provide research that supports your point.

NOPE. 

I can criticize your ""research"" as insufficiently supporting the conclusion you claim it does. 

>The fact that you don't do that shows me, that you're not familiar with actual scientific debate. This is what I meant. This is unfortunately a level that I will not engage in. You are just presenting your own opinion without any substantial support.

I presented plenty. It just isn't compelling to you because you don't understand any of it from what I can tell.

You confuse a blue hyperlink with understanding.

>I have on the other hand provided a logical argument. And that was simply that people without money cannot buy stuff.

That's a premise, not an argument, and one I didn't dispute. That's not the same as whatever conclusion you draw from that premise being valid, let alone sound.

>I have then proceeded to provide not only research on the subject but also expert opinion. This comes from high-level Economist and researchers.

And yet you can't handle a very simple criticism of the methodology.

Your position stands or falls on its own merits. It doesn't win by default until something better comes along.

Scientific debate includes the idea that *maybe* we don't have enough observation to reach a conclusion on the causal effects of something.

>You have simply rejected the research without understanding it structurally.

Based on? I literally attacked the structure of it, and you just went ""nuh uh"".

> You have presented your own opinion without any scientific support.

Sorry but arguments are valid or invalid regardless of who presents them.

This kind of ignorance infuriates me. You think the only kind of truth is empirical truth, and have a limited understanding of epistemology and logic.

Not all truth is empirical. Want proof? All of mathematics, which is literally deduction from a priori assumptions; mathematical proofs aren't empirical at all, but deductive.

Debates aren't just citing experts while you have zero understanding of the topic. It's about critical examination. 

I provided a criticism of the methodology of what you based on your position on. You have provided ZERO valid reasons why that criticism is invalid, nor refined your argument to reconcile your position with that criticism.



>And you are still not providing any such detailed research. That is not a scientific debate, that is the level of debate at a pub.
