datingoverthirty,fe5zr1e,t3_enwiyz,1578878564.0,I love browsing a mall together. You can find out a lot about a person while shopping!! You don’t have to buy anything. Just poke around. My BF and I did that early on in dating and still do. Plus there is coffee and food all in the same spot! :)
datingoverthirty,fe5vr0g,t3_enuwx7,1578876027.0,"Oh golly. You just like her and want it to work out. It’s ok! We’re only human. Don’t be so hard on yourself. But do try and relax. The anxiety will eat you up and ultimately she is the only one who can decide how responsive she’s going to be. 

We all get nervous and insecure. It’s ok.  As long as you’re recognizing that it’s your own stuff to deal with and you don’t freak out at her I think you can work through it and you’ll calm down in time. 

Good luck!"

datingoverthirty,fe43bz0,t3_enp3a9,1578855388.0,"Sometimes I â€œex dropâ€ tidbits when Iâ€™m feeling a bit insecure in my relationship. Itâ€™s a bit of a shallow form of phishing for jealousy. As soon as I do it I feel like a tool and wish I hadnâ€™t. Itâ€™s just an old immature habit that I need to break. 

Iâ€™ve learned for the most part that if Iâ€™m not feeling validated enough I should just say that instead of something lame about an ex.  Iâ€™m fully aware my boyfriend knows what Iâ€™m doing anyway. He has no issue calling me out on it.  Lol. Whoops ðŸ˜¬"
datingoverthirty,fe1znm1,t1_fe1f3oc,1578832789.0,Yes! Thank you!!!!!
datingoverthirty,fe1zaqa,t1_fe0kme0,1578832660.0,"Itâ€™s not a game. The intent is always to ultimately go on said date. The notion is that if a girl needs more conversation before she gives you the blessing of her valuable face to face presence, then she must find a way to do so! 

Girls want to be chatted up, flirted with, wooed. Take a couple of days and charm a lady with your wit and then it will be easy for us to say yes and not have to stall in the first place! ðŸ’‹"
datingoverthirty,fe0cfs2,t3_enaf10,1578809698.0,"This may be a dick move but it works: When a guy asks to meet a tad too early you just stall the date a bit. I make myself seem very busy but still show interest and display that Iâ€™m going to try and find some time. Over the next few days, if he persists with flirting and is interesting then you can suggest a time youâ€™re free and go out with him. If heâ€™s a weeen, you can move on date free. 

It may seem manipulative, but it keeps them from feeling rejected, makes you seem like your life is very full (hopefully true lol) and buys you some chatting time all the while."
dating_advice,fe0bfd7,t3_enhtm4,1578808660.0,"Give it some time... that feeling will taper off. In a couple years youâ€™ll be married and by year 10 youâ€™ll be watching him eat his stupid sandwich reminiscing about the days when you didnâ€™t consider pillowing his face in his sleep. 

Just enjoy missing him for now :)"
LongDistance,fdzu0bt,t3_engb8i,1578795761.0,Lol.  This made me smile. Every LDR girl knows this flighstats tracker page well. Have fun!!!
LongDistance,fdycegr,t1_fdxm5vz,1578778287.0,"But we have had the conversation... Iâ€™m just stuck with the fact that even though itâ€™s known he wants to ultimately move here, he doesnâ€™t have enough security to make that decision a definite one...   How long do I wait for him to make a call?"
datingoverthirty,fdvfbpe,t3_en4556,1578746801.0,"Any guy Iâ€™ve gone on a single date with where it ended up turning into a quality relationship, literally could not stop texting me and vice versa. 

Even back before text existed; they were emailing and calling just to feel connected. 

When thereâ€™s a genuine connection you wonâ€™t have to force yourself to communicate in between dates; rather you wonâ€™t be able to stop yourself because they are always in the back of your mind and you are hyper-eager to learn more about them and feel the joy that the essence of them alone gives you. 

If I went on a date with you and you didnâ€™t follow up with me afterward and didnâ€™t want to chat a touch each day until the next date, I would assume your temperature for me was luke warm and Iâ€™d stop dating you. Sorry but there are far too many men out there who are willing to show show ample enthusiasm for us ladies to sit around waiting for a text.... and it goes both ways so this is not a double standard, but when men take the lead on this and chase us a bit we feel a great deal of attraction towards you for said effort. 

Be interested! Be charming! We need that. In return weâ€™ll be sweet and giddy and excited. Itâ€™s fun!! HAVE FUN!!!

EDIT: I should add Iâ€™ve realized you havenâ€™t gone on a date yet ... my bad there. 

Still ... same principle. If youâ€™ve chatted enough so far that thereâ€™s some kind of click that is urging said date to occur, arenâ€™t you the least bit excited to chat with her a touch each day? Doesnâ€™t it give you any sort of feeling of anticipation or some sort of butterflies to text with her leading up to the date? I think it probably should!! Otherwise where is the drive for the date to take place even coming from?"
LongDistance,fdth3jh,t1_fdtepyy,1578716666.0,"Yes. In your situation, and given your age I can see how more time makes sense. 
I suppose as Iâ€™m pushing 40 and because I wish to build a family life again sooner than later it changes my ideal timeline. 
Every LDR is different. The one thing we all have in common is how hard they are! Bravo to you guys for working towards a happy long term goal to be together. 
Thank you!!"
love,fdtg9ct,t3_emyuzm,1578716328.0,"You may be right (I hope so) youâ€™re probably not, and even if you are... even after 30 years of marriage things can go to shit without constant work. Just donâ€™t become oblivious to the reality of what real efforts it takes for a relationship to work. 

Even when it is â€œit â€œ it can easily become â€œnot itâ€. Iâ€™m not jaded... I do believe in true magical love stories... but Iâ€™m a realist too. Pay attention to how your compatibility unfolds as you come to get to know each other in this early stage. 

I think we can become so infatuated and feel like because everything is just clicking so well that all our wildest love dreams are coming true. In a lot of ways this can happen.... but you have to take the time to really know each other to truly fall in love. 
If we become so attached to the idea of the fairy tale at only a month in, when something comes up that causes a breakdown in the relationship we are so utterly shattered that picking up the pieces can be beyond insurmountable. 

I really hope you two have a beautiful marriage and life together. Please donâ€™t think I wish you ill will. But give things time to unfurl before you decide for sure!!  

Truly all the best."
LongDistance,fdte7zq,t1_fdtd40v,1578715498.0,Thanks :)
LongDistance,fdtctnk,t1_fdtc7pp,1578714937.0,"Good point. I feel both ways about it. Like I should be patient, because he ultimately does need a logical plan before moving. But also I feel like a plan of some sort should be made so I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m spinning my wheels on something that will never come to fruition. This is the debate..."
LongDistance,fdt1htv,t3_emg1qv,1578710700.0,"My BF and I play scrabble and QuizUp. Also FaceTime during commutes to coffee, lunches, work... those types of things make us feel more united. 

Last month I was sad at Christmas so he filmed the pretty lights on his street and sent that. 
I send him bath tub nudes. He does his hair in his towel on FaceTime while I do my makeup. 

Tonight I sang a Smule karaoke and sent him the clip. He sent me a video of his niece picking her nose. 

He had his Starbucks banana bread while I ate my cinnamon roll via video chat. He called me beautiful for the first time. We got in a bickering match about weather or not it actually WAS the first time (it was) LOL. 

Little daily activities shared over FaceTime are what keep me going. I couldnâ€™t do it without the face to face interactions. 

But .... even after all that, tonight, like last night I feel so alone itâ€™s like a stabbing ache. Ultimately, weâ€™re not going to bed together. I canâ€™t sniff his neck or play with his hair. He canâ€™t put his palm under my cheek while I drift off. 

LDRs are HARD. Even when we have a very â€œconnectedâ€ day, when night comes I wonder how long it can go on like this. Then I wake up and his special ring tone sounds and as I pick up the call, and see his face, I remember... I can go on again today because I love him. 

Itâ€™s a roller coaster of emotions. Not for the faint of heart. Iâ€™ve learned to shut up the â€œquitting devil voiceâ€. I try to mentally reference all of the reasons this IS worth doing as opposed to not. 

Good luck. Stay strong. ðŸ‹ðŸ½â€â™€ï¸ðŸ’›"
LongDistance,fdroi36,t3_emrhee,1578687355.0,"Iâ€™ve been in an LDR for almost 5 months now. We see each other about 1.5 weeks per month as he can fly to Canada from US to see me fairly often. Even still, yes.  Iâ€™ve never been so into someone and yet so depressed about the geography of the relationship. I know I want to continue exploring how our relationship can grow, but many days it is so depressing to not be sharing experiences with him, having physical contact and just being in the same space. 

It really feels like a roller coaster of emotions. One moment I think I canâ€™t stand another moment of the uncertainty (no real plans of closing the gap just yet). And 10 minutes later we could be FaceTimeing and I feel like the happiest girl in the world. 

Itâ€™s a very challenging dynamic. I think you just have decide if you think the long term value of the relationship is worth the pain of the current distance. I personally have realized I can only take it one day at a time. As long as there is sound effort on both ends, the good tends to outweigh the bad, even though the bad does feel REALLY bad. 

Good luck."
love,fdcf3ff,t3_ekec31,1578273339.0,"Iâ€™m scared of NOT being in love. After 13 years of marriage I have to start all over .... I used to love being alone and thought Iâ€™d be ok in my own after separation. Turns out all that time with someone constantly by your side conditions you. I lost my ability to sit quietly in my own presence and not feel panicked. 
I hope that goes away :/"
LongDistance,fd6698d,t1_fd58s2d,1578186107.0,Oh man! How embarrassing. Lol. My bad
dating_advice,fd4pprq,t3_ejxus0,1578169857.0,"Iâ€™ve been dating a guy for 4.5 months. I am only a year out from a divorce, so although I know Iâ€™m ready to move on, I also know that the separation changed my dating style  (at least temporarily). 

I am a bit insecure at times, a little defensive and can be a touch needy. These are things that I NEVER would have described myself as in my whole life, until after leaving a 13 year marriage. It just changed me.  My current boyfriend was getting the brunt of it unfortunately. But hereâ€™s the thing....

I was hyper aware of my behaviour and made a point of explaining it to him. I let him know that the betrayal in my marriage has somewhat jaded me... but that I was working on it in therapy and that I was confident that if he could afford me some patience he would see I could come out of my anxious attachment style and into a more secure one. 

A good partner will be able to look passed certain behaviours (so long as theyâ€™re not abusive or manipulative) and as long as youâ€™re making an effort to work towards a healthier state of being together. 

It took me a lot of biting my tongue, trusting him when I wasnâ€™t sure I could, and seeing what issues were coming solely from my insecurities vs. directly from his actions. Be VERY self aware. Communicate your triggers. If he really sees you for you, heâ€™ll understand that baggage is part of dating and that people donâ€™t stay broken forever. 

Heâ€™s chosen to support me through my healing which is more than I would ever ask anyone to do... but he wants to. My job however is to make sure I keep an eye on my emotions and not let them overwhelm him or I. Remember that logic is your friend. Do not let emotions overpower you! 

It sounds like this guy isnâ€™t as invested as youâ€™d like him to be, or maybe just not willing or mature enough to handle someone whoâ€™s fragile. 

Best to move on. A standup guy will hold you up-not push you away."
LongDistance,fd4lj96,t3_ejzh6r,1578168667.0,"It sucks... but if your BF is not bothered by period sex, just hop in the shower and make the best of it. I actually asked my bf when we started out our LDR if he was for or against period sex. He said â€œforâ€ and I was relieved. Lol.  Day 1 and 2 can be a bit crampy and uncomfortable... but if your period isnâ€™t insane then the showers a great option :)"
datingoverthirty,fcyyzoh,t3_eji1aq,1578090205.0,"My boyfriend and I matched on Bumble. We chatted for a few hours and then he asked if Iâ€™d rather text via our tel numbers. I said yes and gave him my digits... waited for the text but instead he showed he actually had a pair and just called me. I loved how he was anxious to move our communicating along :) 
And it was such an exciting surprise to hear my phone ring and find out it was him. Gahhhh the best."
lovestories,fcxlhq8,t3_ejdvu7,1578065818.0,I looooooove this!   Thanks for sharing. Glad you  got the happy ending you deserve.
LongDistance,fcpf600,t3_ei762h,1577861305.0,"How in the world did you manage 7 years?! Iâ€™m 4 and a half months into an LDR and going nuts. Congratulations. Well done. Best of luck together, finally!!"
dating_advice,fcpe95w,t3_eiecwu,1577860238.0,"Yes. I met my ex husband while he was married. He and I had an affair and he left her for me. We were together for 13 years. Separated a year ago. It was a great love with my 2 step children and one child we had together. 

We separated due to many different reasons... but Iâ€™ll tell you that while he was faithful for the whole time, it was two weeks after we separated that he ended up with someone else. Very painful. Some people arenâ€™t emotionally equipped to be alone. So keep that in mind. If they bounce from relationship to relationship or overlap them, it can be a sign of emotional issues. 

I also had to, and still do live with the guilt of being the â€œother womanâ€. They wouldâ€™ve divorced regardless of me, but itâ€™s always there. In hindsight the better union wouldâ€™ve been one that didnâ€™t begin with dishonesty. 

No one is perfect. Things happen. But consequences are heavy when decisions are made at the expense of others. Especially with children involved. 

One good thing that came of it all is that I hold zero ill will toward his new partner. I could be bitter and angry for her moving in on my then husband so quickly after we split, but I was once in her shoes. Ultimately she just wants his love like I once did. I encourage her and my exâ€™s partnership for the sake of my daughter and the woman who will ultimately be her new stepmother. 

These are things you likely wouldnâ€™t think about as you enter this union. I certainly didnâ€™t 14 years ago when I fell in love with a married man. But do I regret it? No. Not for one single second. 

Best of luck."
datingoverthirty,fcj7sab,t1_fcj2or2,1577679412.0,"Youâ€™re absolutely right. To say Iâ€™m less then confident he can do it is an understatement. I have serious doubts that even if he does... it will be in a way that he feels is sufficient and I really do not. I guess this is where it comes down to weather or not two people are compatible. Iâ€™ll give it some time. Allow him to ease into it, but not forever. I just want to know Iâ€™m wanted. I guess we all do."
datingoverthirty,fchnzhi,t3_eh25gl,1577652246.0,Thanks! And yes will do!!! My bad lol
wholesomememes,fcf38i6,t3_eh2ej4,1577626232.0,Ahhhhh! Ok. Thanks for the context :)
datingoverthirty,fceuvx9,t1_fcdooks,1577623943.0,Iâ€™m so sorry. That must have hurt. I think youâ€™ll find someone who will gladly give you all you need. Hugs.
datingoverthirty,fceu8za,t1_fccncwc,1577623841.0,Good! Or maybe they were meant to be in your life ... but just to teach you that lesson. ðŸ™‚
datingoverthirty,fcethju,t1_fcegs7q,1577623607.0,Thank you for saying so! ðŸ™‚
wholesomememes,fcet668,t1_fcend7x,1577623540.0,No. No. I think sheâ€™s walking to school with her dad and he gives up his coat so sheâ€™s warm in class! No?
wholesomememes,fcec4ig,t3_eh2ej4,1577619052.0,If thatâ€™s her Dad... cute :) If thatâ€™s her teacher... Instant teacher lady boner! ðŸ¤“. Sorry... couldnâ€™t resist.
datingoverthirty,fceainm,t1_fccn23z,1577618552.0,"I follow you... the tone was a bit â€œme me meâ€. 
I understand that feeling of a bygone era you speak of. I think it still exists more than most believe. I think maybe youâ€™re talking about a simpler time? Less analyzed moves in love?  A more organic flow and common sense in how to operate? No YouTube videos on what tactic to play, perhaps?
Thatâ€™s how I imagine relationships can still unfold  ...with less thinking and more just freely â€œbeingâ€. 
That is exactly why I decided to stop beating myself up with all the questions and just call him and say â€œhereâ€™s how I feel. Can we do anything?â€ 
Thanks for reading my post even if it was a tad egocentric. I appreciate the feedback, truly. :)"
datingoverthirty,fcck79c,t1_fccg5j9,1577599340.0,"1. No I wouldnâ€™t.  I believe, that for me I need actions AND words to align (within reason) I do not expect to be doted on. 

2. His love language is acts of service. This is why I regularly make efforts to make sure I shop for the food he likes here when he comes, why I pay for half his flights. Why I help him with anything I can when he needs it. 

3. I wish I could go see him where he lives but I cannot. He travels for sales all across his state. Iâ€™ve asked to come visit several times but heâ€™s not stationary so it would be feasible. 

Men deserve to have their needs met too. We all do. That is why I asked him if there was anything I could be doing better on my end to make him feel more appreciated. To which he replied:  â€œNo. Youâ€™re doing great.â€ 

But thanks for asking anyway!"
datingoverthirty,fc3mykb,t3_efywhh,1577393561.0,"Man. I just think itâ€™s sad that the old fashioned sentiment of being so very excited with someone new that youâ€™re dating... excited enough to spend months together has seemingly dissipated. Is it just me who meets someone and decides to continue seeing them for several months because theyâ€™re so special to you? Always in your thoughts? Iâ€™m not talking about instant love, but genuine infatuation that makes you solely focused on that person with the hopes it could blossom into love. If I were dating someone but wanted to fuck someone else ... I would cut the tie! Period! Whatâ€™s happened to respect as a core value? To romance? Breaks my damned heart!!!"
datingoverthirty,fbwxqbq,t3_eepkua,1577162306.0,"One thing Iâ€™ll add is that it can be a little tricky to now have to navigate the inevitable baggage that each partner has accumulated from past relationships. Hopefully, however youâ€™ve both also gained some maturity and skills to work through this. 
I just think itâ€™s to be expected that by our thirties weâ€™ve mostly experienced some great loss in some form or another that leave some wounds. 
Happy dating!"
