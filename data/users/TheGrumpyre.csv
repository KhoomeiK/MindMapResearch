tabletopgamedesign,ff80jn6,t3_es58cp,1579662840.0,"Is there any game related info other than the name and number to be taken in here?  I think it's a really distinctive design for a simple functional card, as long as there aren't any more complex cards that need to follow the same aesthetic.  Very surreal, and different from what you usually see in games."
custommagic,ff561wg,t1_ff52y5i,1579581249.0,"I think the new-player confusion is actually a bigger deal than whether or not it does something, now that you put it that way.

A card that said ""Create a 1/1 token, then sacrifice a creature"" is equally as useless on its own, for instance, but it's much more obvious WHY it does nothing.  I trust a new player to be able to find a use for a repeatable creature-death engine more than I trust that they'll grok how state-based effects work.  Especially if it's in a set like Innistrad or New Phyrexia with lots of death themed interactions."
custommagic,ff52j70,t1_ff4znmv,1579578473.0,"I completely agree with the principle, but I think the sheer breadth of cards that can turn the ""nothing"" into ""something"" pushes it out of the danger zone.

That said, I would approve of some kind of minor triggered ability when a creature dies just to round it out a bit more."

If you're looking for feedback, be careful that you keep the overall volume of things consistent.  If he crouches down and squashes shorter, he should spread out and get wider horizontally so it looks like his body has real mass.  His resting frame feels much bigger than his moving frames right now, so he kind of 'inflates' instead of bouncing fluidly."

But they do fill a hole that's arguably pretty important for the game.  It's just a matter of design finally clicking onto a full-time solution, like they did with Red's ""impulsive draw"" effects."
custommagic,fesxawj,t1_fesmq7o,1579369873.0,"It's not just the fans, I'm pretty sure I've seen Maro dropping hints.

He's certainly said that in his opinion the ""synergistic"" White card drawing abilities we sometimes see are color pie bends or breaks, not a legitimate part of its color identity.  ""Whenever you do a white-aligned action, draw a card"" is equivalent to ""Whenever you do a white-aligned action, your opponent loses 2 life"" as far as the color pie goes.  In his opinion at least."
custommagic,fesl306,t1_fesgyky,1579366344.0,"Yes, but there have been rumblings that White's color pie is being experimented with.  The lack of card drawing abilities in White is a bit of a sore spot among the fans, and there are some new cards that hint at ""everyone draws"" being a narrow form of card drawing that White could theoretically specialize in.  Blue gets unconditional draw, Black gets sacrificial draw, Red gets discard-and-draw, Green gets conditional creature-based draw, and now White gets group-hug draw?"

custommagic,fdkmjtl,t1_fdketqp,1578506662.0,"Well it's a sort of ""tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it"" situation.  Is an effect asymmetrical if it's played in a board state where there's no advantage gained from the asymmetry?  I'd say yes, just like a Murder effect is generally (with obvious exceptions) stronger than an Edict, even if your opponent has just a single creature in play.

The built in advantage always exists, even if there are cases where it doesn't matter."
custommagic,fdkdpwr,t1_fdkd9qh,1578501697.0,"The caster is not guaranteed to have an advantageous board state. But their own board state is guaranteed to give them the maximum possible cards, and their opponent's board state is guaranteed to give them the minimum possible cards.  It's not necessary to have higher devotion than your opponent, it's only necessary for your best color to be higher than their worst color.  That's always a built in asymmetry.

I like the idea that it could punish players for playing multicolor, but if you're aiming for ""plausibly printable"" color pie expansion it makes more sensr if it punished the caster just as much as it punished any other player."
custommagic,fdkcu26,t1_fdkbidn,1578501171.0,"Not saying it's unconditional, just that the conditions are fairly loose, and harder to justify as a symmetrical effect.  

The fact that you and your opponent could have identical amounts of devotion to your respective colors but still draw different amounts of cards sticks out like a sore thumb.  You no longer need a particular board state, you ALWAYS get an advantage in card drawing and your opponent always gets an inherent disadvantage.

I don't know what your goal is in designing this card.  If it's exploring new design space, I think you should go for the version that feels more equitable to all players because that's what makes ""white card draw"" feel plausible and printable.  If your goal is to fix a metagame issue by forcibly bending the color pie, you could get away with pushing it much farther.  But people are going to rightfully point out that it's a bend/break."
custommagic,fdk9m7f,t1_fdjko0n,1578499189.0,"As much as it fits White's flavor to be a little hypocritical in its definition of ""devotion"", this would push it further towards Blue's domain of unconditional card draw.  The easier it is to twist it into an asymmetrical effect, the less White it feels."
custommagic,fdjdz61,t3_elmrxk,1578466851.0,"Symmetrical card draw could be an interesting angle for White in the future, but this isn't symmetrical card draw.  It's way too easy to draw three or four cards and not give your opponent anything at all.  With such a minor 'hoop' to jump through, you're basically just stealing Blue's version of card draw wholesale.

If you were to change it so each player could pick a color of their choice and draw equal to their devotion to that color, now you're cooking up something that actually innovates in White's new design space."

todayilearned,fd4u5y4,t1_fd0m7w2,1578171146.0,"Ah, I see.  I'm still thinking of ""fighting to the very end"" as a choice to stay in the game, not a choice to keep committing resources to a particular conflict.  If you're fighting for territory in a board game or rts game, knowing when to retreat is a great strategic skill.

But if you're in a losing situation in a game, all your optimal long term options still include playing the game.  If you decide to put down the controller/cards/dice and walk away, your long-term gains are nothing (except maybe doing something else you enjoy more).

The exception would be meta-game situations where the outcome of a single game has out-of-game consequences like time limits or gambling real currency.  If you surrender in game 1, you have more time/money you can use towards winning the next game, etc."

tabletopgamedesign,fcspf1q,t1_fcsog1f,1577921772.0,"It sounds like player elimination isn't a downside if the game usually ends quickly.  Instead of changing the economy to ""solve"" that issue, maybe just keep playtesting ways of resolving stalemates faster.

Have you played Love Letter?  It's a fast game that often ends with all players except one being eliminated, but there's a deck of cards that will eventually run out in the few games where it lasts a little longer, forcing it to end."
IntoTheBreach,fcs0agl,t3_eimqpi,1577909358.0,"Hard to say without knowing movement values...

I'd say step 1:  Move the jet to the square between the two hornets, then smokebomb the Alpha so you end up on the top right side of it.

2: Move your rocket along the top right edge and hit the psion (should stun the worm too)

3: Move the pulse mech to where the psion was sitting, and push the other hornet off to the side so it's aiming at the Alpha.

BUT this has the nasty side effect of lining up that bomb with the robotics lab, so you'd lose the core...  Hmmm."
tabletopgamedesign,fcrzcpe,t3_eijncs,1577908865.0,"Sounds like a great game, and it could definitely become a product if you want to pursue that goal.  I love small box games with simple rules.

From the sound of it, the key thing you have to figure out is how to end the game.  The player elimination leading to a drawn out two player duel could be tedious after a while, and if you can find some other condition for ending the match it could hit that magical ""leave the players wanting more"" sweet spot.

As a suggestion, you could use something like Monopoly's ""pass GO, collect $200"" mechanic.  If players collect cash every turn you can keep players in the game longer even if they're behind, you can raise the stakes as the game progresses ($400 might be a lot early in the game, but later on the auctions get steeper) and you can end the game when the bank is depleted.

  BUT maybe I'm being a bit harsh on player elimination games.  They get a bit of hate among boardgamers, but they have their place."

tabletopgamedesign,fc9vorm,t1_fc7v2u1,1577558895.0,"It's not so much about the reward as the fact that the easy path means not interacting with as many elements of the game.

So yes, the path that takes them through more variety of challenges should also be a good strategic choice for winning the game.  ""Make the rewards for the harder path better than the easier path"" is just re-stating the objective, but it doesn't really give me an idea of how to make it happen."
tabletopgamedesign,fc6siwr,t1_fc61p4l,1577488375.0,Drafting seems like a reasonable way to do it.  Still a little worried that players will pick the path of least effort any time they get a chance.

tabletopgamedesign,fc4iq0k,t1_fc4ducn,1577417817.0,"The skills are sort of situational.  It's mainly a dice based game (similar to Elder Sign), with different challenges requiring specific dice combinations such as three of a kind, all numbers being odd, all numbers adding up to at least 12, etc.  Minor encounters are resolved by the same mechanics as the major game objectives, just with different difficulty levels.

  Each player has a role (such as the Driver, the Hacker, the Muscle) that give them different ways of manipulating the dice pool.  The Con Artist can remove a die from the pool, the Muscle can turn 1s into 6s, and so on.   There is never a situation where a specific role can't complete any task, but some have advantages.  Most players start in the same location, the Lobby, but there's a possibility that role cards can change that rule such as letting one player sneak in from the roof.

  It's possible that I could have the character roles define the challenges in some direct way (If you have the Driver in your team, the last challenge of the game is always a car chase or something) but I feel like that's too much stick and not enough carrot."
