stopdrinking,ff907hz,t3_es4zn1,1579701491.0,You SHOULD be proud! 30 days is a huge accomplishment! Congratulations! Keep it up!
stopdrinking,ff7er34,t3_es0ka8,1579647857.0,That’s awesome. When I first got sober (I’m still new - 6 months in) I bought 3 cute sober-themed shirts on amazon. There were days in the beginning that wearing one of those shirts was  alone what kept me going.
stopdrinking,ff65sr3,t3_ers9mc,1579619823.0,Congratulations!
stopdrinking,ff60b2i,t3_ertepl,1579615818.0,I know you can do this!! I was a chronic relapser. Eventually you will stop forever. This is your time!
loseit,ff5dc9n,t3_erpu66,1579588160.0,You’ve got this!
stopdrinking,feocza8,t3_eq70r9,1579298403.0,That was something that was involved with my all time low... did that the last day that I drank back in July. I didn’t even know how it happened (was blacked out) and just threw the shorts I was wearing away. Good luck to you! I can tell you that quitting gets easier each day.
stopdrinking,feob89q,t1_feoaih4,1579297689.0,"Yep, I have them a lot and that’s how mine go. I relapse in my dream, but wake up thanking God it was just a dream/nightmare."

stopdrinking,felkxd2,t3_epejv2,1579224647.0,"I am SO thankful for my wonderful sponsor. I came and went to many AA meetings for about 3+ years before finally committing to the program and asking for a sponsor. I was SO nervous. I felt like it was bothering someone to ask for sponsorship. What my sponsor tells me now is that the relationship helps her in her sobriety journey, too. So... if anyone is hesitant, I’d recommend you give it a go and ask someone to be your sponsor! It makes all the difference for me. Six months and going strong!!"
fatlogic,fek8eyq,t1_feilx4f,1579194765.0,This is great to hear. That will be my total weight loss as well (when I’m done... 50 lbs yet to go!).
stopdrinking,fehx1g9,t3_eozajh,1579125561.0,"I took my last drink July 14, 2019, so today I picked up my six month chip! What an amazing feeling. IWNDWYT"

fatlogic,feeryre,t1_fedts4f,1579039936.0,"I’m sorry for your loss :(
Your words are very inspiring to me. I was a morbidly obese alcoholic not too long ago. Down 85 lbs now and sober 6 months. Your post inspires me to continue my efforts."
fatlogic,feepnoa,t1_fee96mq,1579038582.0,"Exactly! I was pissed last week that I’d come back from vacation and gained from 185 to 193, even though I ate at “maintenance” per LoseIt. Got my period yesterday, suddenly I’m 184.6. That PMS bloat can be deceiving!!"
Volumeeating,fedi03y,t3_eolosw,1579012026.0,Yum. Love liver.

What you *should* do is exercise portion control. 

Wtf? So... the solution is: DIET, but just not *call* it a diet...?!"
leaves,feamjqc,t3_eo8pxr,1578950310.0,I think you made the right choice! Good for you!
