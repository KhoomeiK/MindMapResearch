The incompetence of those in charge and lack of foresight on actual practical approaches to security are directly correlated as well as so naive that resistance to reform out of partisan obstructionism to compromise despite repeated attempts to show evidence to the contrary is quite frankly criminally negligent, but treasonous in that it threatens and has harmed national security by ensuring quid-pro-quo with POLITICALLY supportive regimes that back burner as temperamental allies when dealing with the other party.

gaming,femhpde,t1_fem8nsp,1579256116.0,"Not really, Japan caused such lasting damage against mainland China that many nationalists in rural china literally still want nuclear revenge. The both kinda did the same flamboyant tyrant routine with absolute ruthless state control being more open since Japanese control was mediated by the religious emperor while Germany believed a new Hegelian normal was about to synthesize human progress with human nature in order to make the whole species more efficient by effectively breeding ourselves into subjective superiority by selectively culling. But when all humans view their own genepool vicariously better and not just ideas, actual defects become more dominant when you force inbreeding for simply the procreation of specific mostly aesthetic phenotypes. Nice phenotypes to look at in your selfish view due to evolution hardly have ANY efficacy toward the possible outcome of ANY human or hominid descendants being enjoyable for any who isn't irrationally intrigued by the past's ignorance.

People around the world celebrate as live footage shows the coward country's surface bubble is breached and the rest of their people and infrastructure is sucked quite literally into the vacuum of space to create a new accretion disk around the earth slightly beyond geocentric altitude to fall eventually to the moon leaving a goldmine of spare parts for space colonization on the surface. Not one life elsewhere is lost that day or then on out of relatable joy. The nations that eventually do build this debris in a colony that would one day terraform it, dedicate a plaque in the very first lunar settlement town square reading ""New Switzerland thanks Old Switzerland, the savior nation of mankind"" with a statue of people pointing and laughing at a flying turd flying upward with a mushroom clouds sticking out at different angles with missiles flying toward it.

And while elected officials contend the greater interests of usually two oligarchies in momentary compromise on how to compete or stonewall, the shill officials are more of a combination PR spokesperson to nationales from revolting, but to look out for the interests of their respective oligarchy, sometimes deflecting with a puppet with relatively more power and wealth than any oligarch but never more than 49%. The real power in our world is who controls the majority of military power with generals(shills too) who ultimately have nonoligarch families in their lower ranks who literally carry out power, land, and resource grabs.

This whole system in perpetuation is the intent of all the oligarchies with military power in general to insure they can compete with each other, but not the vast majority of the troops who swear fealty to them. They are our hostages who have gotten good at convincing we are trapped on earth with them, and therefore at their mercy. But in fact, they are ours and would like you to forget that by giving away ANY biased propaganda of blame elsewhere.

This system of wealth and disproportionate power under the law has a name and an inverse. Respectively, hegemonies and republics. In 1776, Americans were sick of the continental hegemony of all Europe's competing royalties who kept industry titans as the seconds by using a religious shill in clergy. After the industrial revolution, hegemony worldwide changed to industry oligarchs getting fat on the increasingly easily manipulated source of downtrodden cheap semiskilled labor in huge numbers.

In the confusion of throwing out the old oligarchies who would not evolve, hegemony grew by convincing the people that progress for the better was happening.

Today industry titan oligarchies have made the interconnectedness of this worldwide hegemony system the new normal by disguising legitimate military leaders as servants of the people with ties to the legislature of members of disproportionate or reserved enfranchisement.""

Can 4 be my denominator?

tl;dr today oligarchies banning together is global hegemony to together compete with people at large. While some still republics exist, although all of varying degrees of impatient turning, there's still hope. Oh yeah, also this sort of drama is just an intended catalyst."
