They are obsessed with The Office to the point where my son and his friends have watched all 8 seasons three times through... Where were they when Office aired originally? Yeah, they werent born yet so absolutely Netflix has made it even more popular than it was."

StockMarket,ffc23am,t1_ffc0bt3,1579789599.0,"I worked for Wells in the '90s and was there as a business and personal banker/loan officer. I always asked permission but I can see how that happened. Wells had a reputation for very aggressive sales goals and had very high turnover rates for their officers. You didn't meet your goals you were replaced by someone younger and hungrier fresh out of college. Also being California in the '90s, there was an inordinate amount of grads pumping out like an oil gusher to replace us at any moment. It was some of the most stressful times of my life.

Wells was a glorified car dealership sales dept."
StockMarket,ffaqowm,t1_ffakhs6,1579742245.0,"My kids and their friends in middle and high school all got Disney+ on goading their parents. They've all kinda run their course on it and are back on YoutubeTV and Netflix, pretty much after Mandalorian finished. Sure the toddler demographic parents will keep it for all the animated classics to babysit their kids with but the preteen through teen demo are moving back.

Netflix has some VERY huge hits, where you been? The Irishman, Stranger Things, Ozark? Theyre dumping BILLIONS into original programming, far more than any other service so there's a lot more coming."

And as for the R party who continue to enable him, thats all about power. They'd sooner lose an election than voluntarily give up the reins to Democrats. Even admitting Trump is bad for the country and letting Pence take over is a sign of weakness they would never abide by. My only hope is enough of us show up at the polls to entirely decimate the R party and president."

The trailer park demographic will always vote for him no matter what while the Democrat voters and independents will be paying attention (mostly) to new developments and additional investigations. Long as voter apathy doesn't set in for them the trailer park vote will continue to be the minority. Besides, just because Bernie cant make it to my state to stump for his vote doesnt mean I ain't gonna show up Nov 2020 to help him out.

politics,ffae13u,t1_ff9wada,1579733389.0,"Dude, this has been done. Nothing happened. A sitting president's CURRENT LAWYER flipped to testify against him with mountains of recorded audio and tons of other evidence and zilch, nada. If this happened to Obama/Clinton/Bush even? Heads would have exploded and they would have been impeached and removed by both parties. Not even counting the others such as Bill Taylor, Sondland, Yavanovith, as a collective with their own SOLID evidence brought collectively to congress. Nope.

The massive expose' NYT did of decades of Trump's financial fraud and dealings? If you had read it it would have made your head spin, it wasnt just some op-ed. Nope.

The Mueller Report detailed full mountain ranges of obstruction evidence, not hearsay. Nope.

Never before in our history has a president gotten away with so much anyone else would have gone down for and with 100% complicancy by the Republican party.

wallstreetbets,ff9ruyt,t1_ff9jk0y,1579719800.0,"They are not listed and have never released their financials so your ""margins"" has no evidence. That being said, Wall Street Journal did an expose' on them using former employees and other financials they could dig up and found they DO NOT make money. In fairness that was in 2015. However unless they do go public we will never know unless WSJ does another one.

Musk has been quite clear the reason he hasnt listed SpaceX on the exchange is because he doesnt want profit margins to drive what he wants to accomplish, such as his goal to get on Mars (which is extremely commendable). When you have Alphabet investing $900MM in your company you dont really need to list anyway which defeats your argument.

We built everything on our own, no promoters as the big name guys wouldn't touch a ""Nirvana"" tribute. We had to prove we could sell out venues, not just bars, and we did and continue to do so, until the major promoters took us on. I will say the bands succeeding in this at our level do the full monty; gotta dress and act the part, play the instruments right, have the same gear, etc. The guys who just go up there looking like any cover band and call themselves a ""tribute"" never break out of the playing to 30 people in a bar. We're pulling 300-1200 a show depending on venue size because we try 100% to give the audience the feeling like they're at an actual Nirvana show back in the early '90s. You do that and the marketing will follow on its own. Obviously you gotta beat down some doors, get good shows with video, sell that on a bigger venue, keep climbing up the ladder. Its taken is four years to get where we are. Hope that all helped!"
