pics,ff4ymvs,t3_erll28,1579575603.0,"Gun-loving Americans are idiots. They think guns make them free. All they do is imprison them. All their schools are enclosed because of guns. Their outdoor shopping centres do better because there are clear escape routes in case someone starts shooting. They say that they carry guns so the government won’t oppress them, yet they are massive Trump supporters (whose government has made massive tax breaks for the rich and taken away free health care for the poor). Their guns are carried across the boarder to Mexico to support the Mexican drug cartels. Some American dummy will refute all of this using their crazy-Fox logic, so I leave you with this: other countries don’t have mass shootings. Idiots. You are too brilliant to keep dying like this. You have given the world so much. It is so incredibly frustrating to see you keep hurting yourselves like this!"

AskGayMen,ff24rtl,t1_ff2431g,1579493792.0,You are very defensive for someone who is not hurt.
AskGayMen,ff23q2i,t1_ff23c45,1579492969.0,"Well said! And, we’ve all been there in some shape or form - so no shame or judgement here!"
AskGayMen,ff23f7p,t1_ff217gw,1579492735.0,You have made contact with his other partners to discuss his conduct. His behaviour with others is none of your business nor is it your responsibility to rescue others from sleeping with him. Take responsibility for your own behaviour and the changes you can make to YOU. You hooked-up with someone you already knew was in the closet. You slept with someone outside of a exclusive relationship. These actions caused you pain. These are things YOU have control over and that you can change.
AskGayMen,ff212k9,t1_ff2063y,1579490958.0,"His actions are his own to worry about. I wonder if some of your concerns are caused by your own feelings of rejection. It sucks to be treated like that, but punishing him is not going to make you feel better. Grindr is a hook-up app. If this guy has not told you that you were in an exclusive relationship, then he has done nothing wrong. You, however have imposed on his privacy."
AskGayMen,ff1zjyg,t3_er6j5s,1579489860.0,"The following is going to be some tough love. It sounds like Grindr dude may have an alcohol problem. He is not going to bring you love or fulfilment. He is in the closet so, even if you were the only guy you would not be in a healthy relationship. You won’t fix him. Association with him will bring you pain. You may also have some dependence/self-esteem issues (your behaviour could be described as ‘stalker’.) No one can complete you - only you can do that. I am sorry you got hurt. Find a guy that is worthy of YOU!"

australia,fdftzs8,t3_el1opb,1578370173.0,I wonder if we should be cautious about blame-shifting. Everyone who voted for a Liberal MP in the last election is in a small part culpable for this government’s inaction. I think we all need to take responsibility. It is not ok just to blame ScoMo & Co without owning that we were the people that put them there. We have to make the hard transition away from coal.
brisbane,fdfsc7h,t3_el264c,1578368991.0,"Bloody brilliant. I think there are many artists inspired by what is happening here in Australia. I wonder if a publisher would put something together, not only as a fundraiser but historic record? I think a record will be important because I think history will judge the Morrison Government and the Australians who voted them in harshly. I believe the fires will be a significant turning point for us. Because, how many lessons do we have to be taught before we give up coal? It is is a tough road ahead for all of us, but works like your wife’s will keep calling us to be our best selves by reminding us of the truth!"

JusticeServed,fclx5qy,t1_fclw8pf,1577758635.0,"No, I am saying that ensuring someone’s safety is more important that catching a perpetrator. Unless it was certain that the people in the overturned car did not need help, the driver should have stopped there to render assistance. There could have been kids in there, someone having a heart attack and, what about oncoming traffic? Easy to say in hindsight though. And, we don’t see if others are in fact stopping to render assistance. Let’s just be glad...justice was served!!!!!! :)"
