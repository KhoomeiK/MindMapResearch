Hitler inspired by Mussolini modeled the Nazis off of Mussolini's model.

Furthermore

The Nazis controlled the means of production.

The Nazis had no free market, they decided what was built and in what quantity.

The Nazis were anti Capitalist, they considered Capitalism to be Jewish.

Although private property was allowed on paper.
There was no true private property in Nazi Germany, everything was owned by the state for the state.
Any business could be confiscated by the state at any time and they were.

The enemy of Nazism was Judaism, The Bolsheviks and The Capitalists. The enemy of Marxism was Capitalists.

The Nazis had a large amount of left wing elements with a few right wing elements (debatable). Some say their militant outlook made them right wing but Marxism, Stalinism and Anarchism contain the same militant attitudes and a similar state enemy model.

The Nazis simply had a Nationalist form of Socialism that opposed Marx's international form of Socialism."
