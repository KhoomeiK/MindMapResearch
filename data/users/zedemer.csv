Better said: the day men can get pregnant and not be allowed to have abortions  that will be the day women can stop having abortions (but even then)"
history,ffnvfss,t3_eua5jb,1580071367.0,"Not from US, so here's my take on it: 

\- either they like the power and prestige that comes from having that position

\- either they didn't get a chance to accomplish all/most they wanted in one term (see Obama's last 6 years with a republican senate) and they want to have a more meaningful legacy

Of course, it can also be both."
TwoXChromosomes,ffnup9j,t1_ffnmd6o,1580071084.0,"You need to take a break from this guy, not necessarily sex, though I understand why you'd want the latter as well.

The guy has been escalating being an asshole in the last few times. This could be for reasons which had nothing to do with you (such as personal grief or anger or frustration), and he chose to take out on you, during sex. 

You don't deserve somebody taking it out on you in any way shape or form, but especially not in a physical way (sex, or just abuse).

Believe me, there are other fish in the sea, no matter your age or your perceived physical beauty (I mention this because I've seen all matter of type of girls who felt ""ugly"" despite what I believed to be the contrary). 

Maybe he has a ""good story"" to why he acted like this, and it's your choice to give it consideration or not (like you said that he didn't respons cause maybe he's sleeping.... he's likely not), but again, you should seriously consider a permanent break."

Tell him that they are waking you up at night, that at the very least they should do this at reasonable hours.
If this doesn't change anything, just blast loud music, porn, wtv, back at him when he is trying to sleep, or better yet after they are trying to sleep post coitus."

worldnews,fffxj27,t1_fffwl4u,1579893972.0,"Ok, what is honestly to criticize about this girl? Look at freaking Australia with their fires, and that's just the beginning. She's creating awareness about climate change and the inaction (at best) or negative action of the rich, the politicians, the corporations. She's giving away some of the years of her childhood trying to make a difference in anyone's future.
So please to tell why else would they criticize her as opposed to all other nameless scientists who have been saying this all along?

I'm not calling those who disagree with me old, white men...I'm saying MOST of those who criticize her the hardest are these type of people. 

I dont think you are one, nor care about it, though you obviously disagree with my assessment. And it is my assessment based on empirical evidence. I'm a guy, white, moderate, middle aged and I have no allegiance to any political party. I just call things the way I see them. 

To give you a similar assessment, ever notice how most GOP politicians are actually old, white men? Does that make me racist? No, it's an assessment based on empirical facts."

gaming,ffffasa,t1_fffcwaw,1579882710.0,"I haven't followed any tips from online. I kept playing the default faction. I never used weather cards. I kept artillery that had multiplied stats when using the same card, the attack guys that had same effect and the ruler that had the clear weather effect. As you can tell, it has been a while since I've played, I can't remember any names.
And I kept adding neutral faction powerful cards to my stack as I got them. I also kept the number of cards in the stack to the minimum as much as possible so I always had the best chance of getting my cards with special effects. 
Lastly, I tried one tactic per round. Either force the other to use up cards while I used spies with cheap cards. Either push for lot of damage up front. Either solid artillery with a double effect card at the proper time."

explainlikeimfive,ffeyy0l,t3_et6lim,1579870852.0,"Ratios and percentages don't care on what they are used, they work. But often companies find (dis) ingenious ways of using them. 
I'll give you another example: store says everything in store is 50% off. Then when you browse, you find another promo, get an additional 40% if say you apply for a store credit card.

You say great, I'll only pay 10% of the price and sign on. When the bill comes, you actually notice it is 30% of the original price and freak out. What happened?

The price was originally reduced by 50%, so it's 50% of the original price. The additional 40% is actually applied on the remaining 50%, so the rebate is actually an additional 20% on the initial price. You can work it out with a starting price of 100$ to make it easier.

So, increasing by 100% means having 200% of what you already had. If what you had was 0.1% chance, then that becomes 0.2%.

Similarly be aware of lotteries or casinos special event where your chance of winning is 2, 5, 100 times better. If your chance was 1 in 300mil, you're still more likely to die in a car accident than win the big prize.
