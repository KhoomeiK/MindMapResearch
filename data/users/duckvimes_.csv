CatastrophicFailure,ffc18ec,t1_ffbuky5,1579788956.0,">	But they have still been expelled from numerous states and countries correct? And the one common theme amongst all of those expulsions is what?

Yes. But that doesn't mean it's their fault. People accused them of starting the Black Plague and of eating Christian children in bizarre rituals; clearly they did not have to *actually* do anything wrong to get people to hate them. And furthermore, ""you don't follow our religion"" was considered a perfectly valid reason to expel people for a very long time (and probably still is in many communities). 

What am I supposed to say, ""the one common theme is the Jews""? Yes, when you take a list of things involving Jews and only look at things involving Jews then they will all involve Jews.

And you just happened to use that *precise* language. ""Annudah"" instead of ""another"". ""Shoah"" instead of ""holocaust"". That's not simply imitating people; that's repeating a meme used by neo-Nazis.
