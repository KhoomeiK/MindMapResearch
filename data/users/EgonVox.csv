PoliticalHumor,ff703pk,t1_ff6j690,1579638439.0,"authoritarians already took your rights dumbass and you let them. you are posturing with weapons you barely know how to use against liberals and snowflakes and your so loved liberties are already being eroded by the very people you think are defending those rights. You are not Spartacus, or George Washington, or the french people taking the Bastille. 
You AR 15 will not stop authoritarianism taking hold in the US, because guess what? it already has."

SubredditDrama,fejz8qd,t1_fejxtru,1579189204.0,"the author of the books himself praised Cavill's performance comparing it to Mortensen's Aragorn for fucks sake. and that guy has been pretty critical of the videogames so you can't really say he's doing it for the money. 
But no obviusly there are at least one thread a day bashing the cast either because they didn't get the characters right, or they are black, or they are too muscular, or for whatever reason."
SubredditDrama,fei0awt,t3_ep6m7w,1579127510.0,"That sub is as orthodox as you can get for a fantasy series. I do love some accurate lore and nerding as much as the next man but they really are the Saudi Arabia of the Witcher. One of the biggest circle jerk out there I'm sure. .
They really fucking hate that TV series and its producers and actors. There are threads up stating that even if they just got 8 episodes of a first season on a streaming service, the future of the series is pretty much doomed and irredeemable."

netflixwitcher,fc09bl9,t3_ed13lj,1577283804.0,"The whole renfri story, the brooch in the sword, who's a real monster and who's not, are really fucking with my head so much. 
Just beautiful. Maybe a bit more manifest tragedy would have made things clearer but it's great nonetheless.

Edit. I wanted to say, it introduces geralt as a profoundly tragic character, alone and despised by most, yet used without much regards from the very people that think a monster of him for something he has no control over. He's more a victim of his fate rather than its master."
