>Whether you thrive or rot doesn't matter much to me. But to extinguish all potential purely because life is not aligning with the utopian narrative you want is hollow. 

As I said earlier, you're making an awful lot of assumptions. At no point did I ever express a desire for a utopian narrative, you don't even know what I wanted.

>You can choose to have either a *potentially* meaningful life, or a *definitely* meaningless death. 

Well seeinghow anything I sayis justan excuse then I guess I can just say option B with no justification. Holding on to life for the potential of a meaningful existence is a pretty blatant example of hope.

>The thing is, having been in your shoes myself, I know the truth. If you were as certain you want to die as you claim, you would be dead. It is not hard to make this happen in a way that people would not realize until it was too late. 

This i a genuinely dangerous thing to say to someone at risk of suicide. Any time I've seen someone say this the end was result was either breaking any trust between the two people talking or pushing that person closer to suicide due to the sense of imposter syndrome that it brings.

We are not alike, I have my reasons for still being alive and you wouldn't know them since you never asked.

I was a dick to people all the time then cried I had no friends; the people who still showed me kindness, I accosted because ""they weren't *real* friends"" -- a goalpost I moved at every opportunity. And when a girl I dated wronged or left me, I was ready to jump off a bridge over the heartbreak completely unaware that I was an insufferable burden to them. 

Yeah, literally none of this in any way matches what I'm going through which makes everything else you've said even more suspect to me.

>Even here in this convo a stranger has reached out to you in kindness and sympathy and all you can do is try to find fault in that. 

Because you're looking at your comment in a vacuum. Your comment is filled with all yhe exact same flaws and arguments that many other comments have, following the exact same patterns that so many others down to exact same same phrases being used.

You call what you're doing an act of kindness but considering how this entire comment is you belittling me and calling me insufferable despite claiming to have also been through what I have, which would imply that you'd know this wouldn't work yet here you are. Insults will get you nowhere.

>You probably do the same elsewhere in life.

Nope. ""Don't let them know"", remember? I have to fake being a functional human being, and this would not help me do that. 

I guess I do it because existence is circular.

>This is what let's a guy jump. It's on the way down, when he turns from you into me. 

Jumping was never on my list of potential suicide methods, so it really doesn't matter. And while we're talking about junping, there has never been cases where 100% of jumpers regretted it, so even if I jumped, there's still a chance that I wouldn't regret it."

I'm not going to talk like everybody else does in these situations and pretend that a better life awaits you around the corner and all your problems will magically be solved.
