NatureIsFuckingLit,ffcb1zx,t1_ffc4pqj,1579795579.0,Thank you so much! I can't wait to share this with my coworkers!!!
NatureIsFuckingLit,ffby3dk,t1_ffbtl2e,1579786456.0,"I'm being honest! I put up inspirational quotes and memes on the fridge at work to try and boost moral a little bit. (I'm the HR manager) and I saw this picture with something similar to ""it doesn't matter what's in front of you as long as you remember who's behind you"" or something as such and I wanted to post it for my colleagues to remind them I have their back."
NatureIsFuckingLit,ffbrw99,t3_esrp90,1579780368.0,I love this picture! I saw it somewhere (either reddit or Facebook) a few days ago and it had an awesome quote to go with it. Does anyone else remember seeing it? If so what was the quote? I want to put it on the fridge at work as one of my quotes of the week.
AskReddit,ff6qgep,t3_erstu3,1579632739.0,"I have a bathrobe near my bed in case of a fire, but I own 3 cats, 2 of which are pure black. In the case of an intruder there are 2 possible options. 1) They will step on one of the two cats, alerting me and my husband (a former marine) to their presence or 2)  my black cats like to sit side by side in the same pose and stare at you like the twins from the shining. It's creepy as fuck by day and in the dark you just see 2 pairs of glowing eyes. I think they'd shit and run. Especially if jack starts meowing because it's a thin ghostly meow."

AskReddit,fem03kh,t3_epp36x,1579235505.0,"I would buy Microsoft office or an embroidery machine, both if I could swing it.

Office helps me with all 3 of my hobbies. Word to write, excel to make spreadsheets for my mmo inventory and PowerPoint to create the custom designs for my embroidery projects.

If I could buy an embroidery machine, it would make the baby bibs I make for my coworkers go much faster and I wouldn't be limited by my inability to draw for the designs on other pieces of mine."

AskReddit,fe9rb6o,t1_fe68msz,1578940822.0,Omg i love the unicorn hunting license. I seriously wanna add it to my resume JUST to see if anyone notices.

AskReddit,fe6owt8,t1_fe6nxtt,1578898685.0,"I don't care too much but I get a lot of ""you two should grow up. Kids do that stuff"" I figure acknowledging it right up front avoids being lectured about having to act my age. :-)"
AskReddit,fe6ostr,t1_fe6o0sb,1578898554.0,Reeses pieces. In the spring i like to buy him the ones that look like carrots because he likes that they're all the same color (he has mild OCD) and I like that they look like carrots because I'm 4 at heart!
AskReddit,fe5v2lr,t3_envws2,1578875607.0,"For us, it's the little things. Bringing home my husband's favorite candy if he's had a bad day, him rubbing my back when I'm having a hard time sleeping, putting little notes in each other's lunch boxes. Just the little things to show you care. Yeah, it might seem childish, but these kinds of things keep my heat still fluttering after 8 ish years.

Edit: I can't believe how much this comment blew up! It's been great reading about all the little things you all do too! And thank you to the nice person who gave me my first silver!"

aww,fcqrrlx,t3_eihpk2,1577891191.0,The all look sooooooo happy.
offmychest,fclwuob,t3_ehq19p,1577758417.0,Can't like this enough. I blocked a huge chunk of friends on Facebook and told them to let me know when they were done hating on others and were willing to go back to being the good people I knew them as. Surprisingly (not) we're no longer friends.

AskReddit,fbvpz62,t3_eekte9,1577134384.0,"My issues is time, not money. (No I'm not rich, my favorite hobbies are reasonably priced.)

I love to embroider and I take that everywhere with me, but I'l love to be able to take the time and learn to quilt, (yes I know quilting is in fact portable) and spend time with my mother making jellies and jams. We always say ""next fall"" and then time slips away."
