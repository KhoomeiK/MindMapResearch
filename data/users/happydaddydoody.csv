gardening,fgf9hbb,t3_exy4aa,1580731173.0,"I’ve had corn like this in my small batch corn stalk plantings. Even with a bunch of plants it’s still not enough pollen in the air. Remember every strand of silk is a kernel. So what has worked for me even with crops as small as a handful of plants. 

After you have tassels at the top dropping lots of pollen at the tiniest tap, cut a tassel off and shake it into a ziplock or paper bag to get all pollen off. Do this with a bunch of tassels for more pollen. Then take a handful of silks and trim them closer to the plant. This exposes the ends of the silks in a very uniform way that makes pollination way more successful. Then just use a children’s paintbrush and dip into the bag and brush pollen all over the newly trimmed and much tighter silk bunches. I started getting almost perfect pollination when doing this."

UpliftingNews,fg81hk9,t1_fg812z5,1580607002.0,Those are excellent words to describe it. Murderous overreaction.
UpliftingNews,fg7zt7v,t1_fg7zftd,1580605737.0,From what I understand it’s because that initial reaction is the bodies reaction to the protein that is determining it’s a threat. So they can be more mild but tend to get worse. Still freaky though!
UpliftingNews,fg7yhuu,t1_fg79rx9,1580604741.0,thank you i really appreciate it. and you too! fingers crossed things get easier for everyone that has these allergies!
UpliftingNews,fg7yg5b,t1_fg77xwx,1580604706.0,"Honest answer, I don't know. As the allergist said, that is the issue with allergies. You're not carrying the epi-pen to jab her every time she has a reaction. You're carrying it for that time that it's a deadly reaction. She has come into contact with them before. Puffy lips, red eyes, itchy neck. Based on her few reactions, skin tests, and blood results, it is highly recommend she stay clear of peanuts and have a pen around in case of emergencies."
UpliftingNews,fg7y8yo,t1_fg76tv8,1580604557.0,Would you mind asking if any of the blood tests for the allergies came back extremely high? For a lot of these therapies they typically have to fall within a certain range
UpliftingNews,fg7y5mb,t1_fg74j6s,1580604487.0,"I'm sorry you've had to work so hard for so many years with so many close calls over so little! I really try not to think too far ahead with all this because it's not only going to be a lot of work for us, but for her as well. At 5 she is very aware of her allergy. Now she has to become aware of others and what they may have come into contact with. In the fall she will be sat at a separate table during lunch for kids with allergies. I only hope their are others to share that table with her so she doesnt become self conscious about her allergy. 

Thank you for the warm wishes!"
UpliftingNews,fg7xvlf,t1_fg70hzx,1580604277.0,"THat there is the worst part. When non allergy parents hear peanut and allergy, the uneducated dont understand that for a lot of kids this literally could mean death. It is truly terrifying. Even as a parent I have trouble wrapping my head around the possibility that this tiny thing could be so catastrophically dangerous. Absolutely terrified for public school"
UpliftingNews,fg7xqe3,t1_fg6zmmu,1580604169.0,This is extremely interesting and detailed. I appreciate your response. You'll be the second person I've heard of that has head out to cali for this treatment and who has spoken so highly of it. As I've mentioned in other comments I am curious if your son's numbers during his blood tests were very high or if it even mattered to at this clinic or for this specific therapy. Our daughter had very high peanut numbers and apparently they were out of the range they considered safe for immunotherapy. As a parent it's nice to see the lengths some people are willing to go to try and give their kids a fair shake at life or at least not have to be on their guard all the time. Parents without allergy kids just dont get it and dont seem to even be concerned about it. In conversation I have spoken to parents who seem offended that they'd have to give their kids something other than peanut butter because some kids at school may be allergic. Especially with how prevalent these allergies are becoming!
UpliftingNews,fg7x1z7,t1_fg6u7wd,1580603661.0,We were at Sinai! The doctor their said that her peanut numbers had gone too high and didnt qualify for the OIT. That hopefully over time they would go down so she could qualify for them.
UpliftingNews,fg7wumc,t1_fg6tvc7,1580603508.0,"That certainly is extreme and I can't imagine how difficult it must be to deal with these allergies when they get that extreme. Thankfully I do not think we're there yet and hoping they dont progress further to that point. She's attending public school next year (has previously been in nut free schools) and their solution is a different table for allergy people. 

My wife was a peanut butter machine during pregnancy! So annoying to be here now."
UpliftingNews,fg7wjah,t1_fg6s9zw,1580603278.0,"how were your little guys numbers overall when it came to these allergies. i know that our girl had peanut numbers that the clinic said were too high to qualify for the therapy. also are these proteins that your son has to ingest every day in order to continue the immunity? if so thats a lot to be sure to have daily! 

how often do you have to go to this clinic? i know someone in NY who takes their son all the way out to this location."
UpliftingNews,fg7wab5,t1_fg6rfig,1580603095.0,"this actually was the same with me and fin fish believe it or not! i've come into contact with fish in different forms before and never had an issue except for salmon. years later when my daughter finally went i asked them to test me and sure enough salmon popped up and said to keep an epi pen. after years i've never had any major issues and any contact has been fairly mild, but like you said any reaction could be THE reaction that gets deadly. we've had epis on board for 2 years now and i think it's a backup for that random response that happens. 

in regards to my girl she had peanut butter as an infant as well as almond crackers a few times and never had any issues. we did the blanket tests as well as they almost recommend doing the whole nut families these days. tested positive for almonds too but never had any reactions to it! they recommended doing challenges in the office which i believe were going to get to soon to see what her overall reactivity is to some of these"
UpliftingNews,fg7vv06,t1_fg6ql4o,1580602777.0,Well that's pretty terrifying. It seems like such a heavily regulated state when it comes to health oriented things.
UpliftingNews,fg7vrf4,t1_fg6oghz,1580602701.0,do you remember if her reactivity numbers were very high? when we originally took her they said he numbers were too high even for the program. i guess she couldn't have handled any of the smallest doses? she is going to be checked again soon actually and hopefully her numbers have come down a little.
UpliftingNews,fg6oj20,t1_fg6of26,1580573228.0,Yes she is. Peanuts for sure!!
UpliftingNews,fg6o737,t1_fg6kl6u,1580573004.0,"Our allergist and their facility actually had their own immunotherapy. Same as the article says, a benefit is it could be more standardized than places formulating their own protein quantities. You had to fall within a specific reactivity number to qualify for therapy but like you said this is only for accidental ingestion. So a peanut or 2 in the end. 

A friend pointed out a therapy in California their child was going to that promises full freedom to eat any quantity of whatever you want when done. Here is the program. I know we aren’t going to Cali from NY but can anyone speak to how this is actually possible?

science,fg375ll,t3_ewelka,1580472984.0,"I teach art/graphic design in high school. Every year overall attitude towards education has dropped. Especially as educational standards have changed, for the worse. The new obsession is conversation. Constant student to student conversation. But it’s all accountable and measurable for grades. Have you have seen teenagers interact. Rarely are they having meaningful long last educational discussions that better them as students. They’re teenagers! All across the board lower and lower evaluations for teachers because of this discussion ‘protocol’ madness. And when you ask the kids how their day has been or how their classes are going, “Mr. it’s endless bullshit and talking. We’re not learning anything.” They want students prepared for college and career, but sometimes you just need to sit, shut up, and take notes. These are skills as well. I’d be bored too!"

Occasional leaking issues in the basement so may or may not be foundation issues. We've dealt with an architect to smash and rebuild so we get a bit more effective property. If we did demo we'd do extensive changes. The heating/AC needs a total overall. There has been plumbing/leaking issues in addition to electrical (who knows whats behind those walls). 

So we have the property and weighing options now. We LOVE the idea of a fresh start for some higher ceilings. It's very claustrophobic feeling in some areas. We'd also like a second floor. If we left the original foundation (one story) I dont know if it could support another story.
