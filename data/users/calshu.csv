confession,fgs1ta2,t1_fgrxxc3,1581067191.0,"There’s nothing in the story to indicate it was his weed or only his weed, so we can’t really comment on that. But even if we say it was his weed, there’s too many gaps in your version. It’s not just that the girl reminds him to leave. She reminds him to leave in time to catch a particular train. And he doesn’t. And even with him being late to leave, she’s the one that has to say “dude really, you HAVE to go now or you’ll miss it.” What if she hadn’t said anything? Like, at that point he was already late — why wasn’t he jumping up himself? Because he didn’t intend to catch his train. 

If someone is *constantly* reminding someone to leave their house in time, why would they not leave in time? I can imagine missing the bus if nobody reminded you or reminded you once (even though that’s still being really bold with someone else’s house), but missing the bus after being reminded constantly? It’s a stretch to say that’s an innocent mistake. Let’s say we excuse him for that and say that he’s the most irresponsible, can’t-take-several-hints adult ever, but made an honest mistake.

His connection doesn’t exist. He lied about his route.

I think your example is actually perfect. You got bullied for red hair, pale skin and freckles. But can you deny that that’s still largely considered pretty? Someone just needs to listen to the lyrics to Jolene or watch tv to know that it is. 

So I’m saying that her argument that this girl *had* to do this because she got bullied to the extreme and this was the *only* way to be pretty makes no sense. She is obviously conventionally pretty in the first photo. She’s just not trendy, but she’s traditionally pretty.


Unless we’re saying blonde hair and pale skin is considered ugly now?

The difference is that not fitting this trend doesn’t mean people will get bullied. There are a bunch of celebs that are considered gorgeous that don’t fit this trend, but they’re still considered pretty. So I don’t buy that people are being forced into it and are bullied if they don’t fit it. It’s a choice."
trashy,fgqu745,t1_fgqtawx,1581031581.0,"I think they can get bullied, as in being told to tan or annoying jokes.  I don’t think they experience severe constant bullying comparable to what people can get for having extremely dark skin experience (children being pressured to bleach their skin by adults, not being allowed to go outside by adults, called roach and excluded from friend groups etc). Like I truly don’t think anyone is getting excluded from a group of peers because they are not tan enough. I went to a predominately white/Jewish high school and I just never saw it. Correct me if I’m wrong though."
trashy,fgqtabo,t1_fgqr320,1581031024.0,"The picture itself obviously suggests that. However, there absolutely are even more obvious pictures showing that blackfishing is a insta trend if you want to look that up. There’s a whole sub full of it. The argument shouldn’t even be about if it exists because it’s *obvious* to anyone who isn’t lying to themselves. Anybody with eyes can SEE that she is not only tanned, but darker than many black people. Again, there is a difference between changing yourself to be tan and changing yourself to be DARKER than many black people.

The actual argument is, has this girl been bullied to the point that she felt the need to change herself to this extreme? That’s suggesting bullying beyond an occasional annoying comment. You’re the one reaching saying she experienced that with no proof. Unlike my point, your point can not be clearly seen by anyone that looks honestly at the photo.

US trends are not proof. The US prefers tan rn, true, but having a preference for one thing does not  ALWAYS mean that another thing will cause severe bullying. The US also has a preference for high cheekbones. That doesn’t mean any  girls without high cheekbones will be severely bullied. That doesn’t mean there’s a normal cheekbone bullying epidemic.

“And frankly, until you’re the grand jury on what is and isn’t culturally acceptable your opinion doesn’t hold much levity.”

True. Neither does yours. But at least I draw my opinion from what’s in front of my eyes, which is at least some support, rather than make up a backstory for someone with no evidence?

You also suggested I go up to everyone I see who has this kind of tan and speak to them. I can’t. Do you know why? I have NEVER irl encountered anyone who thinks this is okay. 

Pointing out that you think something is off is not “hateful”, otherwise your own speech to me could be called hateful. But I won’t call it that because calling anyone that disagrees with you hateful is silly, and I think it’s silly that you tried that with me too.

 Americans in general. It doesn’t represent American culture in general either. It is special *only* to followers of a very specific political campaign and represents *their* culture. That is to say, half of the country thinks the hat is great and the other half thinks it’s abhorrent. Why, then, is the hat being used to represent Americans as a whole on a global scale? It’s weird, it doesn’t make any sense, and — since it’s literally an item of campaign merchandise you can get by going to the website of a campaign for a specific political candidate — it’s *inherently* political. 

Some will interpret it as antitrump in an ironic way and some will view it as protrump. But regardless, it’s making a commentary on Trump at an inappropriate time. That’s another thing — it draws attention away from the people of China and towards America in a distracting way for no good apparent reason. Support for China could have been written on a sign — like every other character with a message had. There was no reason to give America special distracting accessories that are associated with a divisive political campaign. It’s a divisive symbol and it didn’t just pop up there. Someone drew it on.

BrandNewSentence,fgf53lf,t1_fgf4l5u,1580724910.0,"I think the better thing to do would be to realize we all get upset over seemingly small things — we just get upset over different small things, for different reasons. And it always seems reasonable and important to us. A partner leaving a filthy plate on the table seems like a small thing to someone else but it might represent more to us after a years of having to clean up after them while they’re being inconsiderate.

The issue isn’t the getting upset over small things, it’s what’s the source of the getting upset. If the source is understandable then it’s better to just respect that people have different peeves. If the source is bad it’s better to address the flaw in the source rather than the fact that it’s a small thing. 

Ex: there was a time when Gordon Ramsey was calling someone a seemingly harmless variation on their name and the guy really didn’t like being called by that variation. What a small thing to get upset over, right? But the source was childhood abuse being linked to that name. The source is understandable so it’s better to respect that this is a small thing that upsets this person. 

Meanwhile there are people that get upset at the phrase “happy holidays”. What a small thing to get upset over, right? But the source is a sense of entitlement and xenophobia. The source is bad so it’s better to address the source rather than get caught up talking about how they’re being annoyed by a small thing.

I think we instinctively reach for terms because we don’t want to engage in these longer conversations about what mindsets underlie over sensitive behavior.

Teacher,fgeyiwv,t1_fgep8rz,1580715250.0,"I’m not sure if this is true for other states but in NY, you can begin work with a bachelors but you are required to have a masters degree within five years or you can’t teach anymore. 

My advice to the OP would be to pick a well respected CUNY. Good four year CUNYS like Queens and Hunter are very affordable and pretty well respected. I’ve always heard that Queens had a good elementary education program. Hunter is a little more respected in general (slightly lower admission rate) and their secondary ed programs are good. But I suppose if someone already had initial certification they most likely already have their ed requirements and will be going for a degree that is special to their subject. In that case Hunter is slightly more respected that Queens but the most respected CUNY is Baruch. Hunter and Baruch are only about 10-20 minutes away by train. If you decide to pursue CUNY and Baruch offers the degree you want go there. If not go to Hunter.

Since you are a math major you’ll have zero trouble finding a job in NY so don’t dump money on an expensive graduate school. In fact, you can take out a teach grant (they can give up to 4K a year I believe which pays for a good chunk of CUNY tuition) and teach at a high needs school and you’ll never have to pay back any of the money because math is a high needs field in NY."

Tinder,fg6196b,t1_fg609wm,1580548356.0,"I find that really surprising. The annoyance at women who have preferences is a daily ritual in this sub — the whole sub is basically defined by pickup line posts and posts whining about girls who say they want tall men. 
There’s a “how dare women prefer tall men” post every day. There was one yesterday.  I’m pretty sure there were actually two yesterday, but it might have been from the day before that. 

 It’s late af where I live but if you want I can link both posts I’m referring to tomorrow. If you can find a “how dare men want x” post from yesterday I will be glad to take a look at it though."

Tinder,fg602a9,t3_ex0xog,1580546648.0,"If a dude posted a convo of a girl matching him just to ask for a taller dude, he’d be insulting her in the title and most likely being passive aggressive in the convo and everyone would be applauding him. Then invariably there’d be thirty comments saying he’s right and whining about how people can’t help their height. 

I’m glad we all grew up and decided preferences are fine just as this post arrived...Ah, who am I kidding. The next girl to even ask about height is gonna be crucified by the same people who are super chill responding to this post because women aren’t allowed to have preferences.

Edit: it’s worth noting that this guy—if we’re going by this picture—has nothing to make any friend comfortable in his home and is completely satisfied with that. 

I’m an introvert. I like the majority of my time to be spent reading or playing video games. But if my friend couldn’t come over twice a year and have at least a chair or beanbag to sit on, I would not be completely satisfied BECAUSE I care about their comfort.  That’s not to say I would shame the apartment in the photo — but if someone is completely satisfied with that and doesn’t even want any kind of change made, it suggests that they either a) don’t have friends b) are okay with always having to go out to hang out with the friends they have (which costs $$$) or c) is okay with always being hosted and never being host, which is a situation I was in because of poverty and was eager to get out of because again, I care about my friends and I don’t think they should always have the responsibility of hosting. 

Someone else mentioned the possibility of long distance friends. I think that’s one of the only good answers to how this setup might mean something different. But tbh that’s sounds kind of lonely too. Not AS lonely, but lonely."

Saying that everyone else’s arguments against you are bad because you decided your argument is better is circular logic — a fallacy.

Teachers,ff0hmnv,t3_eqxbx9,1579468924.0,"I loved Junie B. Jones as a child. Reading those books helped me develop a love of reading. She gets in trouble, yes, but she faces consequences for it. I’ll never forget the book where she cuts her own hair  with a pair of scissors — it made me decide not to do the same lol. I forget the exact situation, but the teacher didn’t want her to wear a hat in school and seemed like the enemy until she found out what had happened. It taught me that sometimes, people do things that embarrass you or put you in a weird spot but that doesn’t mean they have bad intentions. There were books about her freaking out over not being invited to parties and books where she dealt with the fact that her best friend was much wealthier than she was. Each time, she made bad choices and learned from them. Junie was a troublemaker, but she had a good heart. 

My point is, sometimes stories about mischievous kids are more useful than stories about good kids because mischievous kids get into *realistic* trouble and real kids can learn what might happen to them as a result if they do the same. The grammar issues can be balanced by having kids read lots of other books. I always knew the books express Junie’s unique speaking style and nobody had to explain that to me. As for words that make kids giggle — well, if they giggle, they’re engaged and are having fun reading!"
