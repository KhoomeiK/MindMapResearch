SuicideWatch,ffc4qmd,t1_ffb89wi,1579791487.0,"courts? can they really be that involved in this scenario of feeling suicidal, sorry to seem so dense, i wonder if it's the same in other countries too."
ihatemylife,ffbiz6d,t3_erxa6o,1579767508.0,"I'd probably not worry about them, let them be in their own little world, talk to new friends and don't worry about them or gossiping all that much, especially if you have a crush on the person you're gossiping about, better to talk to your crush to try to spark a common interest if you like him that much, of course it's better to take time building into love than to dive straight in, just thought it was worth mentioning, there's no pressure whatsoever, anyway a friend should be there for another friend, if a friend doesn't leave you in an instant to go hang with better friends then they must be worth something to hang around, well take care anyway, i'm here if you need a friend."

ForeverAlone,femyw6x,t3_epxsxk,1579273132.0,"Literally i think i wrecked it with one before christmas, and another i'm holding hope on my efforts but somehow believe it simply won't turn out right, i'm starting to believe a good number of them simply can't like me for me, for what's wrong with me that many refuse to understand what makes me what i am today and would rather see someone more normal than me, so yeah i'll tell you when i see many attractive crushes that i know they simply won't work out no matter what i do and so i'm slowly more and more not even bothering regardless, things just don't seem worth it anymore."
ihatemylife,femhmv0,t3_epkeq2,1579256012.0,"Well i do respect your request for people not to respond, but i will respond anyway because it draws me in about some things, i've been thinking back to previous years in my life with some people that were hurtful and horrible and even thinking about how this world is made for those horrible and hurtful people, i get where you're coming from, it seems like it's best to stay in our own safe little world where we can only be happy and understood in it and not real life, it actually does seem that way to me at least, judgement and hurt to those of us that are different but not to those that hurt or affected us in the first place is a joke, well i'm offering if you need a friend anyway, not dm though, it don't work right for me, i don't promise anything but i'll try my best to be here as a friend anyway."

CPTSD,fe0qtkm,t1_fe06k3z,1578817599.0,"I do agree with you generally speaking, i've seen too many that would rather play a safe role to themselves than actually try to say or do anything, i consider them professional a## kissers so to speak, but speaking from more than a decade ago for me that when you're in that situation it's either toughen up or stand back to stay safe, this is different to the a## kisser scenario that i see as in that situation in general one has to learn to tolerate what comes afterwards as opposed to a## kissers risk whatever their position or status in society is to become an outcast for choosing to say or do differently to what's become expectation, forgive me if i make no sense."
ihatemylife,fdn8dvn,t3_em5rrl,1578580040.0,"Maths was okay until it got harder and more complicated, i ended up just learning it quickly to pass once and then forgot how to do it afterwards, i wish you luck with it anyway friend, grades don't always matter, just do what you can and don't let it bother you too much."
SuicideWatch,fdjhi6c,t3_elnyk2,1578471044.0,"They have no right to talk, they are not in our shoes and have never been in our shoes no matter what they say or try to make out, when we feel suicidal we are struggling to feel any worth or value in this life, they became content with their lives easily and never struggled that badly, at least that's how i feel about it."

ihatemylife,fddc7ze,t3_ek8es2,1578305201.0,"As a loner i do understand, it does suck being alone in this world, sometimes we have to find our own purposes in this life, if it doesn't present itself then we either have to seek it out ourselves or make it up on our own, i mean it's your life after all, figure out what you like doing or what you want to do that may very well be achievable for the amount of effort you wish to put in, if it seems worth the effort then by all means try whatever things you want to try, no need to commit right away, just see what you like doing or enjoying, anyway you're probably right about love early on, from my years which includes later years as well i think it's one of two things, either their mother or someone else among them gets an idea that the person that asked them out isn't really worthy or actually interested or some garbage, the other reason is the individual was either panicked and asked someone else out quickly or made it up to stay safe, or possibly she doesn't take it as seriously, either way there's probably someone out there that's way better for you and worth your time anyway, hopefully that special someone will be there one day and will treasure being with you and doing things with you, well good luck with it all anyway."

ForeverAlone,fdc5s43,t1_fd99nnh,1578267659.0,"I've noticed in my time when it's the other way round guys get treated like dirt, maybe i've seen enough horrible women in my life that i missed the actual good ones, idk, it just seems a little perceptionalized without any true respect or understanding for some guys but to push a societal view of how each woman is supposed to be and how guys are literally scum apparently, at least it seems like a fixated perception to keep forcing down people's throats with intimidation and intimidative pressure, apologies if i seem pushy on my view or thoughts, i'm not trying to pick anyone off here.

ForeverAlone,fd8cv84,t1_fd6gbmt,1578216993.0,"I actually thought the opposite, seeing someone that was FA escape this, hearing a success story out of being FA made me feel like maybe i could do the same too and maybe i could tell my story someday, well maybe i'm too hopeful."

ihatemylife,fd81fbm,t3_ejj5qm,1578212857.0,"I know that feeling of being stuck in life, except for me it was more about wanting to get on track with it all like finding love and starting a family, maybe enjoy a nice holiday, at least you've got what some of us don't, anyway the most important thing is to be there for your child, it's hard to get free in this world, maybe when you get your finances better you could talk to your fiance about just having a small holiday either with or without family, just throwing out an idea at least, maybe you just need some space at times which is also something you could talk about with your woman, depends really what you're resentful of, do you resent your fiance or your job, bad desicions perhaps or something entirely different, well whatever it is have a think of what you can do to break that mold and do differently, coming to accept things as they are isn't always great, but if it affects you then by all means change is worth a shot, if i'm entirely off the mark then i apologize, anyway it's your life, i wish you luck with whatever you choose to do, i'm here if you just need a friend and your free to vent here if you wish."

ihatemylife,fcmnbvh,t3_efydl0,1577782728.0,"I totally get that, high expectations with school then to follow with working especially with complete turds that have no consideration of others particularly for their own enjoyment to bully or yell and scream at someone for their own entertainment which is pretty f##ked up to put it nicely, at least there's a few good people amongst us all including you and me friend."
SuicideWatch,fcd59ya,t3_eh2oqn,1577606526.0,"Hey, firstly happy birthday, anyway loneliness does suck and all, it doesn't just happen out of nowhere, it takes time to build up that connection, i've been alone a long enough timeframe and should know it sucks that it simply won't happen for me that quickly despite how long it's been, taking time and just talking to different people you're interest in is what helps, sometimes it just happens for some out there, others it takes time like us, only thing is it takes the effort to actually go up and talk to people we like."
