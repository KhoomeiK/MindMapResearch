The main problem is to design a team of three pkm that can 100% beat all others... which isn't possible and that's why over time the rng will screw you over. (maybe except the pyramid which gets easier over time due to the pyramid bag)

From the other games I would get at least Blissey and Suicune. Both are great and CroCune Hase no weakness :D

Crocune is: rest, sleep talk, surf, calm mind

Because all elec and grass moves in gen 3 are special and calm mind can protect  by boosting sp. Def the only way to defeat it is breaking through with physical neutral matchups or hoping for a special crit while getting bombed with +1/+2/+3 stab surfs. Only some mons like vapereon can efficiently deal with that. 

It was/is a beast in adv ou and super useful for battle frontier.
