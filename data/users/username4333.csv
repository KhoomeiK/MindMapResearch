confessions,fdev47b,t3_ekzrqr,1578347234.0,"So, can I just correct your phrasing a bit here: You're glad for the opportunity to turn your life around and pursue your medical degree, not for the death of your daughter.

From the sound of it, you are not glad your daughter died, but for the opportunity it provided you. I mean, her death is not the thing that makes you glad. That is a very important distinction.

A 5-year-old's death is a tragedy on top of the tragedy of her mom dying. Appreciating the bright side of a horrible situation does not make you a bad person.

I mean, you could frame anything badly if you say, ""I'm glad this bad thing happened, because it gave me this.

For example:

>I'm glad Apple uses sweatshop workers who commit suicide on a regular basis.

vs

>I'm really happy with my iPhone.

or

>I'm glad that westerner's diseases wiped out 90% of the Native Americans' population.

vs

>I'm glad to live in America.

You had an unwanted and unexpected burden placed on you at a very early age. If you didn't admit you were relieved about having that burden lifted (albeit in a tragic way), you would be lying to yourself. You can do your duty and still be honest with yourself about the situation.

I am sorry that your life has been filled with so much tragedy, but most people never face even a fraction of the adversity that you have gone through, and you should not feel guilty being glad about one of the obstacles being out of your way.

It sounds like you have some sort of survivor's guilt, like you don't think you deserve happiness, because one of your burdens mitigated itself. That is the only reason I can think someone would frame the amazing amount you've accomplished and overcome as being ""glad"" about the death of your niece/daughter. That is simply not true. So, I would try to work on separating your gratitude for your life's direction from the pain of losing your last remaining blood relative.

I hope you can find (guilt-free) happiness."
