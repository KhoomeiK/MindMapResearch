This would have been changed if he finished it though, he changed his mind about the time frame but didn't fix that detail -- it was originally set 100 years into Aragorn's reign, but he thought that was too pessimistic so he moved it 120 years later. The Dark Tree has a mysterious leader named Herumor. You now know basically all there is to know. If you can find The Peoples of Middle Earth in a bookstore, it's chapter 16.
