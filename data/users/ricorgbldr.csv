politics,fezv1gp,t1_fezm08j,1579462022.0,"We're not as dense as those cities, with a few exceptions. But you can bet your sweet ass we could have a very American-style protest where people just stay at home. Businesses close, people call in sick, en masse, and people just sit at home and don't spend any money for a day. That's the kind of protest we could easily pull off, just with the right call to action."

Oh...... The eastside trail is tres' bougie. That'll change when (if) the light rail goes in and impacts all the foot traffic."

Class P-1a/NU-1a (Locobase 5584) 
Data from the 1930 guide to Dimensions and Classifications of Locomotives seen on [] (May 2003). See also ""Mallet, 0-8-8-0 Type Locomotive for the Lake Shore"" Railway & Locomotive Engineering, Volume , No 5 (May 1914), pp. 180-181, (Thanks to Wes Barris of steamlocomotive.com for his 28 June 2018 email reporting the missing metric equivalents to cylinder diameter and stroke; and to Chris Hohl for his 2 October 2018 email noting the original tender coal capacity and weight as well as providing the link to the R&LE report.) 

Works numbers were 54132-54134 in December 1913; 55908-55912, 55999 in July 1916 and 62368-62370 in January 1921.

This particular design worked as hump yard pushers; similar engines were delivered to the New York Central itself (9) and Michigan Central (2) -- see Locobase 16372-- as well as the , Pittsburgh & Lake Erie (2)--Locobase 13995.

NU-1s were among the very few articulated locomotives operated on the New York Central and were designed to supplant the M-class 0-10-0s (Locobase 12630). Earlier G-5 and G-6 heavy Consolidations (Locobases 5369 and 5377, respectively) had to break up the trains they could haul in order to sort them out in the gravity yards and the all-adhesion ten-wheel M-class switchers had relatively long rigid wheelbases.

In exchange for a 47% increase in weight and almost no increase in average axle loading, the Mallet offered much greater tractive effort. R&LE noted the extensive use of vanadium steel in ""engines, frames, driving axles, main and side rods, rod straps, eccentric cranks, driving springs, tender elliptic springs and crosshead keys."" Cast-iron cylinder castings also contained vanadium.

14"" (356 mm) piston valves admitted steam to the HP cylinders and Allen-Richardson balanced slide valves supplied the LP cylinders. The firebox had a Gaines firebrick arch with arch tubes and was fed through a Street stoker. Firebox heating surface area included 54 sq ft (5.02 sq m) from the arch tubes. The blast pipe had six nozzles of three different diameters: 6"" (152 mm), 6 1/4"" (159 mm), and 6 1/2"" (165 mm).

Bi-directional operation was made possible by providing linked throttle stations on both sides of the cab.

Original tender coal capacity was 14 tons (12.7 metric tons) and the loaded tender weighed 156,600 lb (71,033 kg).

All three remained in service through the end of World War Two before being scrapped in 1947."
