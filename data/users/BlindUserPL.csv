depression,ff2rk5o,t1_ff2puoo,1579520957.0,"What do you mean I don't understand statistics? What statistics?  What are these gender roles that you are talking about.  Internet makes ppl smarter and gives them knowledge to question some stupid things  like ,,wage gap,,. Through our whole conversation you were mainly insulting me and trying to make me look stupid without providing any arguments or proof. I really encourage you to look up for Jordan Peterson on yt or on Google. He explains why most of the things you belive is bullshit. It's funny how you insult me that I act like a child while YOU act like that all the time in every message."
depression,ff2b18q,t1_ff0r95y,1579499221.0,Pay gap holy fuck. It literally made my morning thank you for that. You know that it is just average earnings of men and women right? Just because man work harder and longer doesn't mean that they are getting paid more than women who usually picks less paid jobs and don't work extra hours. For me sex isn't a problem so i can't tell from my own experience but guys are very sensitive to looks and women are more sensitive to emotions. Women usually are chased by guys not the other way. Why do you think there are so many sexy women in ads? Also I have this strange feeling that you are a feminist am I right?
depression,ff0qs5l,t1_ff0q9l3,1579471429.0,I have gone through the worst part of my day which is early in the night when I feel worst so I guess that it is kind of good now. I hope that tommorow is going to be better
depression,ff0o7d2,t1_ff0l4t6,1579470705.0,Sure. Funny af. I guess that I don't live in today's society and I have never met any women so I don't have any clue what I am talking about. I don't say that women are treated like queens or that they have easier life. The society's attitude towards them is different. You need to care about children and cook that's everything you need to do. That's the way you are ment to be by nature itself. Men on the other hand are the protectors and the ones that provide food and shelter for his family. When we can't do this we feel like worthless peace of shit and we don't see any point of life at all. If it is the opposite and women have it worse tell me why do men make up to 80% of all deaths caused by suicide? Why do men make more than 90% of deaths at the workplace? And it's funny that you have bring topic of incels. Women have so much power over men and their sexuality and jet they are the ones that complain about it the most. It's not the contest and we schould try to help both men and women  but it is true that men got it worse.
depression,ff0kztx,t3_er1qrp,1579469807.0,Men commit more suicides than women do. Women are told from the young age to talk about emotions and how they feel and men are told the opposite. I personally love depressed girls and I would love to have one. I don't care if you are man or woman if you are pretty or  handsome and you are depressed I want to be your friend. I am so fucking shallow. I am so fucking alone and miserable.
depression,ff0gyp0,t1_ff0gvj7,1579468798.0,Why would you like to beat up any woman?
depression,ff0flz2,t3_er252b,1579468422.0,"Society want from man to be brave, strong and provide for his family. Only then he can be called a man. And a woman? Only think she needs to accomplish in order to be a part of society is to be a woman. Its simple. It's not fair and it's not okay but it is how it is. You can't change it. And you schould not get upset about it. It doesn't have any impact on you personally. Try to find light man. Don't let the darkness consume you"
depression,ff0eo96,t3_er27ia,1579468186.0,"Sometimes when I want to live and I don't think about suicide as the best option I just dream about little house in mountains, food and one person that I truly love even tho I don't have one. I know that it will never happen."
depression,ff0d9o8,t3_eqwuvt,1579467810.0,Yea I can't believe that our society still functions
depression,ff0c9pa,t3_eqyok9,1579467562.0,Actually very accurate
depression,ff0c2oo,t1_ff0bneq,1579467487.0,Depression is very hard to label and everyone expirience it a bit different I think. If suicide is what gives you peace of mind I am the last person to stop you because if I got courage to do it I would already be dead. But I'm not. Maybe we will find light in our life who knows. Seek help go to a therapist or just talk to someone. You can  talk to me if you want
depression,ff0bcez,t3_er0p1d,1579467178.0,I feel sorry for you. Not because possibility that you may and up dead but because of what has led you to this decision. I feel truly sorry for everyone who struggles with this sickness.
depression,ff0b200,t3_er0ssg,1579467059.0,I feel exactly the same. I am in very similar place as you are and I don't know why the fuck schould I love longer. Do you feel that working out doesn't help you anyhow too? Or socializing with ppl. I don't have anyone that I love because I usually feel sadness or I miss someone. I only have ppl that love me but I don't love any of them. I haven't kill myslef only because I don't want to hurt them and I also still love life but I just don't want to do this anymore. I almost burst into tears when I think about future
depression,ff096ab,t3_eqqhlp,1579466552.0,How was your day?
depression,ff08rs5,t3_equ7ke,1579466398.0,I usually stay up late with headphones on my head because I fear silence and staying by myslef. I never had any problems with falling asleep but now I can lay in my bad for hour before I actually fall asleep.
depression,ff07wd8,t3_eqsxda,1579466168.0,"Fuck. This is exactly what o think. On Friday my friend told me that he really likes me and I am a valuable person for him and that I matter. He didn't notice that but when he told me that but my face has changed. From real smile to mask of smile. In my head I was thinking ,,fuck fuck fuck fuck,,  and I realize that this is another person that I would hurt. Not so long ago we had a conversation about suicide and depression. I have told him that I will probably not do it and he told me the same. But now situation got worse and I truly want to kill myslef. I don't like him as I used to as well. I don't like anyone that much as I did actually. I feel very tired of social connections. I just want to be alone even tho I love talking to others. Fuck this"
depression,ff0673d,t3_er15cg,1579465652.0,"For me is to do some activities. I have found a half used bottle of graffiti spray. I was happy whole day it literally made my day. It costs only few bucks but it gave me happiness. I also really like going for a ride with my bike and just do tricks and having fun for few hours. I want to buy a motorcycle so I can have more fun with it and maybe I would kill myself. I like exercises because they at least hurt and I love how I look because of them. I like playing with knifes and some other weapons too. I like riding on my skateboard but I don't have any decent place to skate and it's also winter. I would also like to try parkour but for now I enjoy walking on the edge of the bridge from time to time. All those activities help me deal with myslef. There are other things like drawing, music, coding and journaling and probably even more. Just try to find out what works for you"
depression,ff04mtw,t3_er0lvl,1579465178.0,It always amazes me that ppl can function for so long with this fucking disease. I can't imagine living even one more year not even thinking about my whole life. Try to seek help. Go to a therapist. Call USA suicidal hotline if you feel like ending it
depression,ff03qum,t3_eqy0k1,1579464829.0,"I am on my first year of highschool. I am not sure what do I want to do in life. I know that I probably have very well paid job as a programmer but I'm not sure if I can make it through those few years. I want all my friends and my family to dissapear so I could waste my life for a bit longer and just drown myself in sadness do I could  just end it all. My grades are still good I don't fucking understand why but I don't care. J know that I have few tests this week but actually I don't give a shit. I have watched today a great film called ,,breakfast club,,. Andy from this film is someone that I want to become because I don't have any better idea for my life. And when I think about death I just remind myself about him and who he is and that he still can live his life and enjoy it. But I hate having hope. I rather don't have any."
depression,ff01qpv,t3_eqyt1w,1579464266.0,No problem feel free to message me
depression,ff01jg1,t3_eqymht,1579464176.0,I always feel sorry if other ppl say things like that. But I really wish to kill myslef too and I accept it. It's weird. I always feel like I schould tell you that life is good and worth it but I don't believe it myslef so why even try to fool others if I can't even fool myslef? But I have heard a lot about suicides. Some of the ppl that has jumped off the bridges have actually survived this. And every single one of them at the very moment they have jumped knew that it was a bad decision and they regret it. Try to ask yourself is life really that bad and worthless as you think? Can you do anything to make it better? Do you have any not fulfiled goals or dreams? Try to find some hope man I really wish for you and me to get better.
depression,ff009nh,t3_eqndfm,1579463752.0,I remember the day when I woke up. It was dark. After laying for like 10min I thought that o schould probably light on some light. So I did. And I immediately turned it off again as I saw the world for the first time this day. I spend 2h more just laying in the darkness
confidence,feszf5y,t3_eqj2tn,1579370444.0,"Why you prioritize sex that much? Focus on self development rather than having sex because it will never lead you anywhere. Find passion, start working out and find a gf. Then go ahead have as much sex as you want. And also don't try to use porn instead od sex it will not help you anyhow and you will become addicted to it. I personally really don't recommend this shit"
selfhelp,feogli2,t1_feofo4w,1579299896.0,Thanks mate. But I don't even want to wake up tomorrow and I just know that I have so so so many fucking years ahead of me that it terrifies me. I think that I just get used to thinking about dead and wishing for it to happen. I still enjoy life at times but it doesn't matter for me. I just want to end it all. But don't worry to much I am a pussy I will probably wait with this few more years to at least become an adult( I am only 15). I honestly don't know what could make me happy on this world. Everything is so fucking empty and pointless.
depression,feog583,t3_eq6h8r,1579299626.0,I guess this could be depression. If you don't get better after few months it's not just regret or sadness. But I am not a therapist and I don't know shit about anything. It is a good idea to go to a therapist. For now try to find yourself something meaningful to do. I know how it feels man. This is the only think that helps me feel ok except socializing.
depression,feof9ks,t3_epzn1b,1579299350.0,I just don't understand ppl like that. Or maybe not that I don't understand them I rather don't understand why do they still live. I would like to kill myslef but I have to much ppl that I will hurt if I commit suicide. If I was alone in the world I would be dead already. But I am also a pussy so i would probably struggle with this decision for a long time. But I wish to be dead everyday for like few months now and Im only getting worse
depression,feoez1t,t3_eq5z5o,1579299165.0,Try not to push yourself too hard. Forgive yourself. Understand that you need time. Don't give up on drawing just try to find something that you can easily draw that will improve your skills.
depression,feoecdo,t1_feoe6b8,1579299005.0,I do find peace of mind. When I have a knife on my throat or I am standing on a bridge. I feel really calm at those moments. Or when I am alone and I just think.
selfhelp,feoe33p,t1_feocqua,1579298854.0,I want to die not to have a better life. I want to feel better that's for sure but I certainly want to kill myself. I'm sure of this one thing more than I'm sure if I want to be happy. Life involves too much effort and I don't want to live it anymore. I feel sad for no reason and I feel really bad. Of course I also do feel good but good things passes so quickly that I can't even enjoy them. Life is beautiful at times and I really love certain things in it but I overslept just want to die. It will be great to just go to sleep and never wake up. I don't know how long i will be able to pretend that I care about anything. I don't give a shit about pretty much anything and I don't want to do anything anymore. I feel tired as hell I don't even have energy to talk with others. I really want to enjoy life until I am old enough to go for a trip by myself. A trip that I would never comeback from. Maybe I will stay in mountains alone but even my own company sometimes feels like a crowd. I feel really alone in this world. I just really wish for it all to end.
selfhelp,feo8bo5,t3_eq6oiz,1579296469.0,No I don't got this. I truly don't. I don't even want to be better at all. I want to be worse actually

depression,feo2kkj,t3_eq3hqt,1579294207.0,Most od the music that I listen to makes me emotional in one way or the other. But actually not so many things makes me feel better. No matter what type of music it is I just don't feel good. Only lofi hip hop gives me sense of calmness and warmth. I love coding and listening to this. It puts me in a good state of mind
depression,feo1qpb,t3_epvzb0,1579293979.0,"I don't even want to be better actually. Because it will involve living life. I don't fucking want to live. I want to have something that will justify my suicide. But at the same time I want to feel good at list until I kill myslef. It is not decision that depression has told me to say and if I got better mood i would change. This is my choice, a rational thought. I truly want to dissapear but I don't want to commit suicide that much. I would rather just go to sleep and never wake up. No regrets no pain. I fear life. I fear everything even tho I don't. Even good thoughts makes me depressed because I know that good things will pass eventually. I  hate and at the same time really like it when other people like me because I don't fucking want to have anyone that  cares about me so it will be a great excuse to commit suicide. I feel pretty good when I think about being dead and that's my goal in life except finding a gf even tho I know it will probably make me even more depressed. I still like life and I am able to enjoy things so I feel worse about my thoughts and my choices. Fuck this I don't know why I write it here"

depression,fehyxik,t3_ep1tuq,1579126683.0,"I want to have a gf. I don't know if it will make my life any better. But not just a girl that you hang out with and all this shit. I want someone to be with me, to live with me and sleep with me. I want someone that will care about me and who would love me for who I am. That's my only life goal. I am in highschool now. I have 4 more fucking years to get out of this shit and start living on my own. For now I don't even look for a girl, they are way to young for me even tho I am their age.There are girls that I like but none of them is a girl that I could love. It will also be impossible to have a life that I dream about in highschool living with parents. I also fear rejection as hell. I am just sure that if someone that I love would break up with me I just kill myself. Suicide is my second goal/dream in case I don't achieve the first one."

depression,fehxihi,t3_ep78py,1579125836.0,Past 3days were blessing and I felt like a fully stable mentally person for a while. It isn't happiness. It is rather end of suffering. I was doing all of the things I schould have done and I was enjoying them. First time in a long time suicide has not seemed to be a good idea. Even if I was alone with nothing to do my mind was a warm and comfy place to go and I was able to rest. I was hoping to stay like that for the rest of my life. But today i feel as bad as before. Great :/
depression,fe30pbw,t1_fdp907m,1578844786.0,"I don't go to a therapist but when my ex gf and few ppl I knew at this time was facing depression I helped them. I know how to talk about my feelings mostly from this  expirience which also gave me knowledge about this illness. I still have pretty good contact with my ex and when I feel really down I can text her. There is also one guy on Reddit who is very nice and wise and he has been depressed too so he knows how it is. But usually when I'm down it is to late and they already sleep (I tend to stay awake for way to long). Now the school starts again I will be ok for the most part of the week. I fear weekends. But I have made it three weeks straight (I mean I was sick in home without friends and classmates) so I will go thru weekends. I made a promise to myself that I will never commit suicide. But when I feel down I am not fully in charge of myself. I try do to the things that I am really interested in like programming music, drawing/journaling and workouts. I also try to quit porn addiction but I struggle a lot because of my depressive episodes."
depression,fdz5h3x,t3_endmnd,1578786898.0,I am not sure if you seek for any advice or you just wanted to share it with others. But there is a lot you can do. Try to quit drinking or your vape but don't try to quit them both you will fail. Start working out. Start taking cold showers. Meditate. Eat healthier. Seek for help. Quit porn if you watch it too. I'm sure there is even more you can do those are just the best that comes to my mind now.

depression,fdz0u7k,t3_ene131,1578785523.0,"I always wonder why do others complain about adjusting to others. Even before I got depressed and I stopped caring about others I was like "" everyone wears jeans? Allright let me just get my pair of tracksuit frome the wardrobe"". Stop giving a fuck about what others thinks of you. It doesn't mean that you schould act like a dickhead and treat others like human trash. Just be yourself and don't care what other will think of you. Try to meet other ppl if you are not satisfied with what you have. The ultimate advice is not to be a creep. Really it is all you need to do. The hardest part is  to engage ppl to  conversation. Try to have a little smile on your face just before you say something and your whole sentence will have a bit of it. I don't know why others stress so much about school so I can't help you with that. Wish you best bro"
depression,fdyy8qf,t3_ene1hk,1578784742.0,Start working out. Even tho I am generally very tired all the time when I workout I give my Max and I try to push myself as far as I can. Try to fix your diet. Go outside. You don't have to meet with anyone or anything just go outside the house. Spend some time walking listening to music or whatever you want. Get some sunlight. Try to meet other ppl. Take supplements. Find a new hobby. Something will eventually click for you. Do you take any antidepressants?

depression,fdyszey,t3_enc98p,1578783293.0,We as humans are social cretures. I enjoy being by myself too but you just need to have some friends to talk to. If you don't know anyone who has similar interests like you try to find them. If you like chess join the chess club. If you are young try to meet new ppl at school. But you don't have to have a lot of friends to feel better. I am one of the most sociable person i know but i have only 1 really close friend that I meet up with and I am consent with this.

Most of my days are good or at least bearable but there are days like today when I feel so fucking bad that I just want to die. Not dissapear or feel good just die.

But today I had knife on my throat 3 times and I was thinking about death pretty much whole day. I have even attempted to cut myself for the first time in my life.

But when I try to write some code I often got bored. I mean if I write something by myself I feel cool- the flow state. I just don't like going throu boring yt tutorials and learning absolute basics. But usually I forget how great feeling it is to write code by myself and I just dont do it. But thanks for reminding me about that. I am also glad that you are better with your depression I hope I will get better too. God speed
Stoicism,fcywt57,t1_fcywkt8,1578088806.0,This is very interesting topic at least for me and I think that computers and AI is the future and ppl who knows a lot about this stuff will be way ahead of those who don't. But I am very lasy person and even tho I am smart I find it really hard to motivate myself to do anything actually :P

howtonotgiveafuck,fco06d5,t1_fcnzkep,1577821712.0,"Thanks mate. I know that I schould just enjoy life and stuff but I feel like I schould do something really productive. I do enjoy programming and all the stuff I do but sometimes it feels like I MUST do them to live and to find work in the future and I don't do it for myslef. It's really stressful sometimes. It is hard to be happy tho with no goal or any desire in life. Sometimes it just hurts. But I will try to be myself more and do things that I enjoy and are meaningful. Thanks for your time, wish you best in the new year"
