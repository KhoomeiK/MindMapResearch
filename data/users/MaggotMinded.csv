For uncircumcised guys, the foreskin ""rolls"" back and forth over the head, so even without lube it's not abrasive. It's like the difference between rolling a pen across a table versus sliding your hand across the table's surface. I don't get how circumcised guys aren't chafing themselves without using lube to reduce the kinetic friction."

Instantly lost all respect for her as a mother. If she'd said she was concerned about hygiene, I wouldn't be so appalled, even though I strongly disagree with the notion that uncircumcised boys can't be healthy, because then at least then it would be coming from a place of good intention. But the fact that she so nonchalantly admitted that she would surgically remove a part of her child's body out of pure laziness really pissed me off."

PSA: Phimosis is often caused by an underlying condition such as a fungal/yeast infection and in such cases can be easily cured with a combination of clotrimazole (or other antifungal agent) and hydrocortisone."
MakeMeSuffer,fdjjqsu,t3_elfkg5,1578474053.0,"PSA since it comes up every time the topic of circumcision is mentioned:If you suffer from tightness/dryness of the foreskin, it may be the result of an underlying condition such as a male yeast infection (yes, men can get yeast infections, too). Before you resort to the nuclear option of circumcision, consider treating it with medical ointments first. A combination of clotrimazole and hyrdocortisone applied twice daily does wonders for fungal/yeast infections. Using this treatment I went from being unable to retract my foreskin without cracking the skin even when flaccid, to having a completely healthy, functional foreskin that I can retract fully even when hard. Again, that's clotrimazole and hydrocortisone. Clotrimazole kills the infection and hydrocortisone heals the damaged skin. Use them both together, not one or the other.

Here's the most important part: when you are once again able to fully retract your foreskin without discomfort, keep it that way by making sure to always wash up *immediately* after sex. Do not wait until morning.

I'm typing this because these are things that I wish I had known when I first became sexually active, and because phimosis seems to be something that gets brought up a lot on circumcision threads, without many solutions being offered. Knowing how easy it was to treat my own infection, I think of circumcision as being a lot like cutting off your toe to get rid of a wart. Technically it works, but it's much better to just treat the wart. I'm tired of seeing men say that they had to cut off a part of their own manhood because of an easily curable condition. As men we have to look out for each other. If this information helps you, please consider passing it on whenever appropriate."

videos,fdh6cry,t1_fdgu3uu,1578416337.0,"By that stretch of the imagination you could call literally anything art. An athlete might also explore a number of different techniques before finally settling on one that maximizes his/her performance, does that mean that their training process constitutes art? The act of discovering faster routes is not 'abstract'. You can do what the game allows you to do - even if it wasn't designed to allow it - and you choose the action that results in a faster time. As for it being like a choreographed dance, again, that is something that allows for a great degree of variability in its execution and its interpretation. Whether you like Swan Lake as a ballet or reimagined as modern dance is totally subjective. In speedrunning you're either the fastest or you're not; there's nothing subjective about it."

Can you, though? I don't think that art is a good comparison because art isn't necessarily about optimization, whereas in speedrunning you're always trying to do it in as little time as possible, no matter what. If it was about finding new and inventive ways to complete a level *regardless of time taken*, then I'd say you might have a point, but speedrunning is only concerned with finding *one* way: the fastest way. If you took ten painters and told them to paint the same subject, you'd get ten different results and not one of them would be more ""correct"" than any other, whereas in speedrunning if someone finds an innovative way of shaving off a few fractions of a second, then all of a sudden everyone is doing it that way. Speedrunning is more comparable to a sport than it is to art, in my opinion, due to the metrics by which it is judged."
todayilearned,fdg59k3,t1_fdfzmwy,1578380551.0,"Google tells me that the risk of death from skydiving is 1 in 100,000 each time you jump. For comparison, if you drive 10,000 miles in a year, your risk of dying in a car accident is 1 in 6,000. When you go skydiving, the expected outcome is that all goes well and you land safely. Same thing with most sports and other physical activities, which have the added benefit of reducing your overall risk through good health (in other words, a sprained ankle every now and then is worth it). What do you think is the expected outcome of gorging yourself until you can no longer move?   


Also, it's not some contest where only those who lead the most risk-free lifestyles are entitled to criticize the morbidly obese. When you think about it, every activity boils down to either a net positive or a net negative effect on your health. As long as a person's lifestyle balances out such that they are improving/maintaining their health more so than they are harming it, then they have ""done their part"", so to speak. That doesn't mean they have to be in perfect health, just that they've done the bare minimum to ensure that their continued existence doesn't come at a cost to those around them."

I'm speaking more in terms of games like League of Legends where even if everyone on your team is dead and the enemy is in your base, there is always going to be some ridiculously slim chance that someone on the enemy team jokingly starts a surrender vote and they all hit 'yes' by accident or some stupid shit like that (and yes, I have seen this happen).

news,fbv6gxa,t1_fbu9p96,1577126306.0,"Yep. I grew up on a farm where I was put to work from an early age. Then I worked a variety of manual labour jobs to get me through school. No benefits, no paid time off, nothing. Now I work at a large company making twice as much doing desk work with health and dental coverage, free snacks, breakfast on Fridays, weekly social events, parties on holidays, etc., etc. And if I decide I want to go back to school for a class that is relevant to my work, they'll even help pay for it. Most importantly, deadlines are realistic and I'm not overloaded with stress.

Corporate work environments don't have to be soul-crushing nightmares. When I go to work in the morning, nothing about it feels ""antithetical to the human condition"". If anything it makes me feel a part of society, knowing that I am one of hundreds of employees working toward a common goal. 

Toxic workplaces aren't the result of corporations, they are the result of poor leadership. If you hate your job, you should make it a priority to find a new employer who values you. It could literally save your life."
