I believe if there was a breed of dog that was specifically bred to kill humans, there would still be people out there who would want to own it and take pictures with one around their kids to prove some sort of point (just like people who own dangerous exotic animals for reasons unrelated to rehabilitation). I don't see how you can be a level headed person and not feel sobered by that quote. Here is a person who has a PhD in canine research, spent 1000x more time on this subject than you or I have, has written dozens of books on dogs, some of them defending pitbulls saying that good training can make them viable, and she STILL cannot stop them from nearly killing her other dog."
