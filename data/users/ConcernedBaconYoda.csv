Often times what scares you is just created by your own mind.
Also, smile in front of the mirror and when talking  to  people, it gives you a better mood and also to the person you are talking to. Start from little things in the inside and build it up to the outside"

AskFoodHistorians,fcyz73g,t3_ejlmm0,1578090340.0,"[Not food historian] Hard to say, we would have to go really back.. I did some research but found nothing concrete.I think it could be due to the Arabs introducing sugar canes in Spain in 700 a.C, combining to the fact that greeks in the past used to eat bread soaked milk or wine in the morning. 
Some suggest that the term ""breakfast"" comes from latin (collatiònem, that means ""to give and reunite""). However, there are historians who think that ""collatiònem"" was misinterpreted by monks around the VI century, confusing ""colatio"" with ""collatus"". I know, kinda confusing but I will clear your ideas immediately.  ""Collatus"" and ""collatiònem"" have the same meaning ( breakfast, as I said above) while ""colatio"" means  ""soup"" as in milk soup. The monks misread ""colatio"" (with 1 L) and thought it was ""collatus"" (with 2 Ls) changing the meaning of the words. 
SO, to answer your question, it could be due to greek's sweet tooth."
diet,fcywfvo,t1_fcymn3v,1578088575.0,"Agree, as long as you don't make it an obsession, it is a good way of losing weight. I'd say to look at your overall daily caloric intake in a week span. I.e.: 2400 calories? Maybe too much for how much active you are,  so you just go down to 2300 to begin with. Still too much? Let's go down to 2200!! Veggies and proteins can fill you the most without increasing too much the overall calories, so that you don't get cravings and feel satiated during this new routine. It takes time so don't stress about it, slow and steady bring lifetime results"
nutrition,fcxnny9,t1_fce4w68,1578067249.0,"YES, sorry for the late reply. I was experimenting new alimentary choices and now I prefer fibrous foods, fats, and protein, over fruits. Now is a matter of reducing the portions in order to not indulge. I noticed I was getting a little fatty on the belly area when I used to eat tons of fruits, but not when I ate quite a lot of the substitutes I quoted previously. Probably insulin resistance... I also feel more satisfied when I eat, so that's even better"

No willpower, you suffer at first and then enjoy the benefits of your actions.  Mediocrity is easily rewarded nowadays, you can see it with children. It doesn't take much to be just  better than average and successful. If you want it, you get it. Decide what you want and know that you can't complain if you don't put in the work to be better. That's where consistency comes... pleasure in ""struggling"" and in getting better every day. Self talk is important but silencing that voice that says ""oh but you can't right now, you will not be comfortable doing this"" or ""don't get up of bed, it's cold outside, you wanted to run at this time in the morning? Sike, stay in bed"" is important as well. shush that little voice everytime it comes up and PUT IN THE WORK!"

It was an extreme method but I can say for sure that it works well. I lost my physical achievements (flat stomach and showing abs) but it was worth it in order to re-establish a healthy habit.

nutrition,fcafr14,t3_egvzou,1577568458.0,"Not a Doctor nor a Scientist. As far as I know visceral fat builds up once you aren't active, thus the build up of stored energy. Subcutaneous fat is the same in terms of energy reservation. The difference resides in the fact that you can get fattier even by being active and working out, by eating more calories than you consume. A good example I can think of is Sumo wrestlers.

So if I think about a good way to get a little fattier, is to eat calorie-dense foods or just increase your daily caloric intake little by little.  However,  I suggest to stay away from refined sugars and not to consume many sugars in general because your body might get insulin resistant, conserve a lot of water,  and give a jiggly effect that impacts your vision of yourself. Plus other shit but you know yourself better than me
If someone could correct me about anything, I'd really be grateful.
