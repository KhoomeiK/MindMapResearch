Apologise to the person and thank them for being there for however long they were. If they don't want you back in their life or they are just unsure it's more than okey to not be. Stuff happen we are hurted we move on we heal and get better. If you are not able to be part in their life now and it hurts you you can take that as a punishment if you believe you deserve it. But one day hope to be able to be with then again, reintroduce yourself as a person who grew up now and try again.

Also there's no weight limit (there is a carry limit but you won't get overcumbered )

Look I played horizon zero dawn for the first time about 2 years ago and I loved it but I didnt appreciate it as much as I should had, lately I've been playing the witcher 3 and even tho a great game its not nearly as beutifull and aesthetic as hzd is, I try not to use fast travel on witcher but its the same (with the exception that on witcher il probably lose a sidequest if I fast travel) if I do or don't the world in hzd is unique and I believe more games should had been like that, I believe that future open-world games should not have a fast travel option but instead make it so it's enjoyable to travel on your own"

You lost 2k fucking stupid, take the L and move on you can't do nothing about it don't linger to it anymore you don't have to, take your time you just acted imediately after being hurted it is not you, you know you are better than this just make sure it won't happen again remember to take time to procces your feelings.

2: I believe videogames can cause a ""better"" attraction to gore and anger issues
3: it is really annoying when this happens but not because of whatever restrictions are gonna be in the future of gaming, accusations of this issue is made by people who consider humans to work in a a+b=c order while humans are much more complicated than that, and even through studies it shows that videogames aren't the causation of mass shootings, violence etc people still choose to scapegoat videogames wich only shows how ignorant they are, scary even on not believing facts and having an unturned head.
4: modern videogames are a form of art like cinema is a form of art. People of this age don't seem to regognise this with a few exceptions (Hideo kojima, David cage and many others this are just my favorites)  but all this hate towards videogames has been almost eliminated through the last decade's and I believe that as years pass we are gonna see even more attention to videogames.
