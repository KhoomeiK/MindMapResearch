AskReddit,fgkwvfy,t1_fgjdy9n,1580875524.0,"While you are welcome to make your own personal rules, they are based on an erroneous assumption. If a woman doesn't sleep with you on the first date may not be because she is not into you, but entirely the opposite. That she *is* into you. Women and men are often raised under a different set of [dumb] rules and they grow up with these ingrained in their heads. For example, the idea that a woman is slutty for having sex with someone quickly is a common one, so many women will purposely hold out longer for guys they want want to impress because they don't want the guy they are really into to think they are slutty."
AmItheAsshole,fgil270,t3_ey9ou3,1580824718.0,"I think there are NAH, but I believe if your boyfriend had communicated better, you wouldn't be in this situation. It is definitely a common expectation that your partner will pick you up from an airport. Had you arrived to a message saying ""I am really sorry but the weather makes it hard for me to see and I don't feel comfortable driving at the moment so I am sending a lyft for you, let me know when you've landed"", you would have been disappointed, but understanding. Instead you had to make contact with him and essentially ask him where he was, only to find out that he wasn't coming at all. I think most people would feel a little hurt that their partner hadn't shown any concern that they had come all this way to visit and landed with no attempts at communication from their partner."

AskWomenOver30,fg58p6s,t3_ewpjxp,1580521086.0,"Skip washing your hair everyday. It's costing you time in the shower, and then extra time to dry and style it.

AskWomenOver30,ffweicq,t3_evdtoc,1580297930.0,"I don't like the word cheating, because it implies a tangible physical act, and this is not always the case.

Instead ask ""is this a betrayal to the vows of my marriage, and the unspoken agreement to remain loyal and respectful to each other?"". Then yes, this is cheating. Basically, if the other person is going to be hurt by it, and you know they are going to be hurt by it, and you yourself would be hurt by it if the situations would be reversed, then it's a betrayal. He knows this is going to hurt you, and he has decided that his own enjoyment is more of a priority than respecting you. I have no doubts he would be having sex with someone in real life were he able to, it's just the situation has not presented itself yet. It sounds like he's using you to fund his life. Time to pack up and move forward with your life."

AskWomenOver30,fft1847,t3_euowxi,1580201620.0,"IMO thinking you would make cute kids is not a reason for having children. You have children because you are really excited to put in the long haul to parent children into adults. That looking after people is something you would choose over sleep, over the loss of free time, knowing about the monetary expenses, and the 24/7 care that your children will need from you. Also, that you would still love to have children and raise them regardless if you were not partnered anymore."

AskWomenOver30,femjffj,t3_epxnmy,1579258653.0,"While we would all love to see all the horrible things our exes have done to us to make it easier to move on, the reality is that they are never going to willingly hand that information over. People who can lie and cheat, aren't the type of people to confess when confronted, instead they double down on the lies, and often turn the argument back on you, and it becomes an undignified shit show where you end up with none of that proof you wanted, and instead feel guilt and sick in the stomach that maybe it was your fault that he treated you badly. They are very good at doing this. 

The truth is, you don't need a ""valid"" reason to break up with him. If you don't like his little toe, and can't imagine spending your life with someone with that little toe, then it is your prerogative to leave him. Having a gut feeling that he isn't the one for you, is more than enough reason not to commit to someone forever. Your forever person won't make you feel good only sometimes and bad other times, it will be a wholesome consistent feeling of support, and care, and trust that remains even if you have a fight. A warm feeling of safety and love. Keep looking for that feeling, and make no apologies for leaving someone who can't give that to you."
