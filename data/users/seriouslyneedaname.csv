todayilearned,ffmih0e,t1_ffmh441,1580055192.0,"I have to admit that after decades as a corporate drone, I have almost lost the ability to concentrate on one thing fully. I am so used to being on a conference call, pinging with a colleague or three, and doing my actual work all at the same time that my brain seems to seek out extra stuff no matter what I'm doing. Even after declining most of the meetings that didn't meet my do-I-benefit/can-I-meaningfully-contribute threshold there were just way too many."

todayilearned,ffmfvyr,t1_ffmc6v2,1580054119.0,Then the Yahoo CEO decides that working remotely is a bad thing and your unrelated company starts laying off the employees who don't go into an office because of this. (Obviously not a very smart company if they're looking to Yahoo for guidance)
todayilearned,ffmfmtc,t1_ffmco2w,1580053976.0,"Collaboration tools like Slack and IM (and IRC channels before that) had long ago erased that issue, and in some ways make communication better. If you're online and available, you're ""at work"" and if you're not, you're not. You can even set your status as ""in a meeting"", ""on vacation"", or whatever.

The biggest pro was that it is so much easier/more efficient to get a ""quick question"" answered. If I would go to someone's office or work space, there is the time spent with pleasantries, maybe we'd start to chat about something else, etc. Or maybe I'd see they're busy with someone else and have to wait and then go on to something else only to have to circle back around later. Also, they would have to drop everything to address this person who has come over to see them personally. On Slack, it's much easier to ask/answer asynchronously and was much less disruptive. You could also choose to talk in the public channel (I used that a lot with my team for how-to stuff that anyone would benefit from seeing) or as a private sidebar. Another huge pro is that the team can be located where the expertise is. I've worked fully remotely like this with an international team, and have also managed a team that was mostly based in a different state from me.

The downside is that you get less chance to build personal relationships, and to stumble upon knowledge by happenstance. If you are the only remote person on an in-person team it can be a real disadvantage, as even being in tune to the office gossip (more of the rumors-of-a-reorg type, not Fred-is-sleeping-with-Phyllis gossip) is very useful. If the entire team is remote then it's a lot less of a disadvantage, and can sometimes be beneficial since one poison person can't infect the entire team's morale as easily."

WhatShouldICook,ff7ji5y,t3_erzke8,1579651020.0,"Make booze balls! Pulverize cookies in a food processor and put into a mixing bowl. Mix in a bit of Kahlua or another favorite booze (peppermint schnapps also works well) until moist but not wet. Ratio is approx 1/4 - 1/2 cup of booze to a regular-size box of cookies. Start on the lower end so you don't end up with a gloppy mess. Roll into balls, and then roll the balls into some powdered sugar to coat them. 

If you want to be fancy, you can add chocolate chips before you add the Kahlua. But since you have so many cookies I'm not sure I'd bother. They'll keep in the fridge for weeks, or in the freezer for a long, long time as long as they're packaged well (I put 6 or 8 into a Food Saver bag and remove the air)."

They both have some pink on the leaves, but on the older plant it's much more of a reddish tint, which is why I'm not certain they're both the same."

funny,fesrood,t1_fesjz3y,1579368313.0,"Go to Amazon and search for ""K&H cat bed"". I have had several of them for years and haven't had any trouble with them. They're relatively inexpensive and can be left plugged in all the time since they aren't as hot as heating pads made for people. I have a flat one on the couch, and another on the bed, and they were instant cat magnets. I also have one of the round beds, but the kitty who liked that one has since passed. 

My one piece of advice is to cover the bed with a towel since it makes cleaning a breeze: just change to a different towel while you launder that one. The covers that come with the beds are washable, but the furry overlords don't like to be displaced while you do laundry."
