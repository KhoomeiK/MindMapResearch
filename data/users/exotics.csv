ArtCrit,fesyv53,t3_eqgfti,1579370278.0,"Honestly well done. 

Two things I notice. The first you can’t change which is that the dog is too low in the painting leaving so much space above the head. That’s something to keep in mind for the future.


The second thing is fixable. The body. 

You see how you’ve got it at the bottom fading away with three points slightly lower. If a person looks at it too long it sort of becomes confusing as to if the chest faces left or right. I’m pretty sure it’s facing left (our left). But because you have a low point on the right it’s odd. The body is there and the body is going away from us so you want to suggest that by not showing as much lower on the right. You can fix this by putting your dark color over the lower part a bit on the right somewhat curving it up from the bottom. 


Generally speaking with pets where you can’t show the full animal to end it in a nice curve.  Sort of fading away like you have but with a curve if that makes sense.  Right now it almost looks like two front legs on the left so I’m also suggesting filling in that area a bit more so that it ends in a rough curve going up more at the very right. 

So adding more light colours on the left and removing them by painting dark on the right."
