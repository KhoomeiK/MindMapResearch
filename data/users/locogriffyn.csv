My dad was born and raised there in a suburb called Redford, if I remember right.  In about 1989 the area he grew up in went downhill.  Some murders, fires, etc. If I recall correctly, there was a drug related murder on the other side of their back yard.  What forced his mother to move was her house was broken into several times by crackheads.  Last time we visited Detroit, it was a boarded up, burned out abandoned house with a hole in the roof badly painted with polka dots.  I think it is now a vacant lot.  The elementary school he went to is now closed and boarded up.

I think Detroit is doing ok, trying to rebuild.

You gave your friend the best life!  Going to work with you, his Kong wobbler, him protecting you.  He showed his love for you in so many ways!  

It will hurt for a long time, and I am sorry you had to make that decision of letting him go.  I always ask my animal friends to come back if they can, and who knows?  Maybe the do.  

I wish you and your family peace in this time.

Edit- adding the Rainbow Bridge poem

Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.
When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.

All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.

They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.

You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.

Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....
