https://www.history.com/news/the-history-of-birth-certificates-is-shorter-than-you-might-think

During WWII hiring was a problem because estimates were that 200,000 people a year were being born without a birth certificate and that one third of American-born citizens didn't have a birth certificate.

Younger people have very different experiences than older people because things in a country are always changing. Fifty years from now the Republicans would not have implemented a birth-certificate-based voter ID system because by then the millions of Americans born without a birth certificate would all be dead. They did it now because now it still works to suppress a targeted demographic."
HomeImprovement,fg14af0,t1_fg0ukz3,1580420466.0,"Couple of thoughts about your posited scenario. One, OP didn't mentioned three-way switches in use. Basements typically have just one entrance, at least the ones I've seen, and as such a three-way switch would not be useful or appropriate. So, removing the three-way switch as a significant probability leaves one with the condition where all of the kitchen outlets are being supplied by power going through a light bulb filament. Light bulb filaments are essentially resistors, dissipating current in the form of heat and light. 

If you wire an incandescent bulb in series with kitchen outlets, the available power to those outlets will be reduced. A very small draw device will still be able to receive enough voltage to operate mostly normally, like small device chargers, but anything significant like a blender, microwave, mixer, etc, the most commonly found items in a kitchen, will not. The voltage drop will be so much that if the devices operated at all, they would likely quickly suffer damage from the undervolt condition. 

Sure, it's theoretically possible that OP has three way switches, or that they only ever used their kitchen outlets for small draw devices and never for any of the typical appliances most people use in their kitchens, but the more likely scenario is that whatever was wrong OP's wiring, the light bulb wasn't part of the problem and their basement light isn't wired in series with their kitchen outlets. If OP had replaced that bulb with an LED or CF bulb then the scenario would be even less likely, especially with the LED option since the current flowing through one of those would be measured in hundred of milliamps at most."

You mean, other than having founded several companies before being hired by Burisma, and having served on several boards including Amtrak? You do realize he's got a Juris Doctor from Yale, right? They don't just hand those out like candy on halloween. He also has a degree in history, but his law degree is the big one.

Now, I don't disagree that his hiring by Burisma was politically motivated, but that motivation was on the part of the CEO of Burisma who was looking to make his company look more legitimate. Along with Biden, the CEO also hired a previous president of Poland along with several other famous names. He was paid up to $50k a month, but certainly less than a million dollars a year. If someone backed a dumptruck load of money up to my door and I didn't have to do anything illegal or immoral to accept that money I'd be a fool to turn it down, just as you would be. The fact of the matter is that Biden didn't do anything illegal, immoral, or unethical by accepting a board position at Burisma. 

Was the CEO corrupt?  Probably, and the prosecutor that Joe Biden and the rest of the world worked to get fired was refusing to do any real investigation of corruption anywhere in Ukraine, including Burisma. It was official US public policy to get that holdover prosecutor fired, and the new prosecutor appointed by the new Ukraine president Zelenski is doing a much better job of rooting out corruption."

Think about this: ID wasn't required to vote until relatively recently, and our elections have been relatively free of in-person voting fraud for decades and decades without any ID requirement. It's been proven over and over again than voting ID requirements suppress voting, primarily Democrat voters, and combined with voter purges drastically skews voting to the benefit of Republicans.

That requirement was specifically chosen because it targets poor people, and poor people are more likely to vote Democrat. Birth certificates are a relatively new thing in America, it wasn't until the 1900s before they even began to be issued, and even then they were more of a novelty or memento since no daily activity required having one. You could vote, drive, join the military, etc, all without a birth certificate. Many people didn't get one simply because the main way to get one, via a hospital birth, was financially out of reach. In the south, if you were black you were often excluded from entering a  white-only hospital, and being black in the south often meant you were too poor to afford a hospital birth anyway. You would be born at home, and there would be no birth certificate. These limitations on obtaining a birth certificate were widespread through the 1950s, and even today in places of extreme poverty, such as along the southern Texas border, it's not uncommon for a child to be born at home. There are processes in place now to obtain a birth certificate from the county for a home birth, but it's not cheap, and they are often challenged by the government if the demographics of the birth are not to their liking. Currently the Trump administration is refusing to accept the validity of county-issued birth certificates hispanic home births in south Texas, for example.

Being born without a birth certificate is not the only way you not have one. Poor people tend to have difficulty keeping documents and such due to frequent moves, for example, or the originals can be destroyed by accident. That's what happened to my original birth certificate, it was lost in a fire. There are generally processes to obtain certified copies of birth certificates, but they're generally not easy or cheap, and they require knowledge that you may or may not have access to. There are lots of people that don't know where they were born, for instance, and not knowing what city/county/state you were born in creates a serious impediment to getting a replacement birth certificate. Again, this is a problem that affects poor people much more than it does middle class, and again this is often why birth certificates were deemed critical to getting a voting ID.

I was lucky, I know where I was born and that county was not far away. I also remembered my parents' full names, including my mom's maiden name, and that information was required to get a certified copy of my birth certificate. It cost me a bit over $20 in cash for the certificate itself, and a half-day off work to go over there and apply for it. I had a car, too, and could afford gas. A few minor changes in my life path to that point might have rendered it impossible for me to get my birth certificate."

The Chinese government itself has a well-documented history of destroying both cultures and people, both past and present. Presently they are mass-incarcerating Uighurs, and are systematically destroying Tibetian culture and society, to name just two examples. Another is what they are doing in Hong Kong, violating the treaties they agreed to when Hong Kong was returned to China from the British. The Chinese government and leadership lied when they agreed to allow dual rule in Hong Kong, and have made it clear that they'll destroy Hong Kong if that's needed in order to bring HK's citizens fully under Chinese authoritarian rule.

A lot depends on how the roof structure is connected to the house and the garage. There also may be local and county rules about this, so I would start off by going down to the local city office and ask about what permits may be required, if any."
HomeImprovement,ffxhq9x,t3_evn0xl,1580325385.0,"If all the hinges are tightly screwed into the door jamb and door, look at the gap across the top of the door. Is it even? Or is it tapered. If it's tapered then the foundation has shifted a bit. Moving the striker plate is trivially easy, all you need is a wood chisel, hammer, and screwdriver. It will leave an indication that it has been moved because of the old pocket's outline.

Make a small pencil mark on the door even with the center of the latch striker, close the door and make a small pencil mark on the door jamb across from the mark on the door. Open the door, remove the plate, and move the plate so that the hole in the plate is even with the mark, then trace the edge of the plate and the hole onto the door jamb. Use a hammer and chisel to create a new recess for the plate and make a new hole for the latch to fit in. Mark the new holes for the screws and drill a pilot hole (a pilot hole is a hole that's smaller than the screw threads but helps the screw go in straight), then install the plate in its new location. It's likely you'll need a longer screw if one of the screws is going in through where the old latch striker hole is.

I do this all time time in my house, it's an old pier and beam home with some of the piers not going deep enough, so I have to adjust my door striker plates as the seasons change and the soil dries out or gets wetter."
HomeImprovement,ffxgtoy,t3_evnwne,1580324862.0,"From a physical and financial point of view, you can probably get the inside of the house significantly quieter by spending ten or twenty thousand dollars, but the outside will never be much quieter, especially  from aircraft. If you're allowed to, a tall concrete wall faced with foliage will limit noise from the highway, but the wall will need to be between the yard and the roadway as well as at least partway down the property line away from the highway on each side of the property. This will be prohibitively expensive even if the city allowed it.

The psychology here will probably be the most important. If you cannot learn how to divert your conscious focus from the noise then the only other option you will have will be to move, otherwise your mental health will deteriorate and you'll end up moving at some point anyway, but with worse financial and mental health consequences. 

People learn to adapt to their environment all the time, it's part of being human. People in densely populated cities learn how not to hear traffic noise, sirens, neighbors clomping around upstairs, etc. People learn how to live on ships and submarines which are extremely noisy. Even in regular homes you learn not to hear the HVAC unit running, the toilet refilling, the dishwasher running, etc.

I think you're going to need a combination of things to get to where you'll be happy in your home, and if you're unable to achieve that happiness then I would seriously consider selling and moving on. I can say that it's likely that any money you might lose by selling will be far exceeded by the money spent attempting to fully soundproof the inside of the home."

I thought ""lying bastards"" would be too...extreme, though it also captures my thoughts about the matter. The clear intent of the people attempting to prevent trans children and adolescents from receiving puberty blockers is to force those children to go through the irreversible physical changes that come with natal puberty. These physical changes make gender-reassignment surgeries far more difficult and much less effective, and I presume the thoughts in the minds of these folk is that increasing the costs (both physical and financial) and reducing the effectiveness of gender-reassignment would make it more likely that a transgender person would chose to (or be forced to) remain in their biological gender. These folks don't care at all that one of the major outcomes of this is misery that often leads to suicide or other forms of self-harm, and in fact I suspect that for many of these folks that outcome is considered a good one. For many of them, any harm of ""other"" is a good harm."

worldnews,ffxc3h6,t1_ffx7i90,1580322097.0,"Corona virus' estimated mortality rate is 2-4%, compared to seasonal influenza mortality rates that average 0.01%. This makes corona virus 200-400 times more lethal than an average seasonal flu. However, it is less lethal than SARS (10%) and MERS (34%). Corona virus also shows early indications of spreading between people a bit easier than some other viral infections, though nowhere nearly as easily as measles.

China has 1.4 billion people, if only 10% catch corona virus and 3% of those die as a result, that will mean the deaths of over 4 million people. That is not insignificant. Even if only 1% of Chinese in China are infected, that will still be almost half a million fatalities. It's important to note that these fatalities (so far) are occurring despite relatively modern access to medical treatment. It's likely that outside of a hospital setting that the mortality rate will increase dramatically."

At the founding of our country, the age of puberty for females was often 15 to 17 years of age, not the 10 to 14 that it is now. So, giving puberty blockers to someone until they are 15 years old only produces the results that existed naturally 200 years ago. The people now saying that puberty must occur when it naturally occurs don’t even know that today’s puberty age onset is much younger than it used to be."
