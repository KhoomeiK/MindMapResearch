Look, some people have few or even no friends.  Some of those people just get on with life and do the best for themselves they can and put time and effort into themselves and their education/hobbies/job and eventually they make changes and see changes in their life.  These people don't sit and cry about being lonely.

The people who just sit around and cry and whine about aren't likely to see any changes."

She was laughed at for all her 'shenanigans' - she'd be stumbling around outside her flat, or out of venues, getting in fights, doing strange things.  People just laughed and reported on it in the sense of her being a druggie and a problematic person - not in the sense of needing help.

She was still getting booked for shows, even though she was in no state to do them.  She'd show up, absolutely hammered and put on a terrible and embarrasing short set and disappoint the punters and be reamed in the papers the next day.

I kept thinking to myself *WHY?  Why are people still booking her?  Who is letting this happen?*  She was called 'controversial' in the newspapers, 'out of control'.

And then she died... and suddenly she was the voice of the generation and a lost talent.   Where was that admiration for her talent, and the concern for self-destruction when she was stumbling around in Camden Town?  Where was their worry for her health when she was still able to be reached?"

Ok and *if* you change your mind, you can then change your actions.   *If* you decide you wanted to get married and/or have kids in the future you can then start living your life with those goals as your intention.

I don't see what the big deal is and why people try and hold it over others heads with ""you'll change your mind!"".  You haven't decided to amputate a limb for no reason, you've just decided that marriage and children is not an intention/goal for you.  Hardly a worrisome decision that you can't come back from.

Do what you want with your life, yes there will be push back because some people can't imagine a woman not wanting to be married or have kids for some reaon.  Society is totally fine with men not wanting to be married, and is fine with joking about men being conned/tricked/dragged/bullied into marriage by women who are just *desperate* to be married because it's a mandatory step for women to be people or some shit.   

But fuck that.

To me the idea of having children is like Prison.  You're timetable and desires are mostly out the window, and you are at the mercy of tiny dictators who will expect you to respond 24 hours a day.
