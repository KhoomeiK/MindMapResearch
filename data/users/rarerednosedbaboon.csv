beautifully written, thought this was a movie quote."
CVS,fgiczpn,t3_eyid2h,1580817299.0,"Unfortunately you're question won't ever get a clear answer. It might help you to know that when people treat you like that, they are hurting inside. They subconsciously think that treating you badly will help them feel better, but it wont. They are taking their pain out on you because they have poor emotional intelligence.

Be glad you dont have their miserable life and try not to take it personally because they would treat you like that no matter what you looked like or how nice you were to them. It isn't personal. And it's about them not you."

Political_Revolution,fgagmqa,t1_fgac1g2,1580650940.0,Ok I agree. I just think its odd that you would defend the DNC?

ender3,fg0neqa,t3_euiist,1580411310.0,maybe if you had enough life experience you could screw the nozzle in without asking for help.

Anticonsumption,ffzs8z5,t3_ew0nw1,1580391414.0,we need some type of service like this! I would pay the same price I would for a new phone/computer to get my old electronics fixed so that they could run the latest software.
pharmacy,ffvm35k,t1_ffvad5q,1580267334.0,Ugh that's where I live too

It's a shitty world.

Edit: and I was in Pennsylvania. No fare. CVS owes me bank. I should boycott them.
Edit #2: Fair*"
CVS,ffti7lf,t1_ffthsof,1580221223.0,"yeah! I definitely ask for raises now at my job. 

I think the way I messed up with CVS is I started when I was 18 years old and had just been fired from Subway as a sandwich artist. I asked for $7.25 (minimum wage in PA) because I was afraid if I asked for more, they wouldn't hire me. I probably could have asked for $9 or $10 and got it. I did not foresee being there for 6 years."
CVS,fftabao,t1_ffsete7,1580214242.0,Ugh
CVS,fftaao7,t1_ffsqzlg,1580214223.0,Yeah. I stopped working there in 2016 so nothing I can do now but I wish I would have advocated for myself to get more pay.
CVS,ffrb9kz,t1_ffr6jdl,1580154461.0,"thanks everyone for sharing. I made $9 as a pharmacy tech after 5 years. then i transfered from central PA to New jersey and the cost of living was higher there so i got 12.50

It is still such shit pay for what is demanded of you"
CVS,ffqfbig,t3_eult1t,1580132902.0,I think you should do it! But dear God it pisses me off to learn that shift supervisors only make $13.28
mildlyinfuriating,fff3w64,t1_ffeg8ep,1579875018.0,"thanks, this is very comprehensive! Seems like a lot of people volunteer for noble reasons, so it's a shame they get stuck picking up after some lazy nightmare person. Seems like there could be a better use of their time."

Meanwhile, customers who are courteous and respectful and would never complain because they're understanding \*dont\* get a $25 gift card."

TrueOffMyChest,ff8r5vc,t3_es5vqz,1579692734.0,"Shit i had no idea people treated others like that just for doing a repost. Well youre right. Its harsh and extremely over the top. For what its worth, you dont deserve to be treated like that and when someone says things like ""you deserve to die,"" something is wrong with them, not you."

Scams,femwvo6,t3_epstwg,1579271719.0,"My guess is that this is for a door-to-door sales position. Not really a scam, but a shitty job and they will probably misrepresent it to you. Door-to-door sales recruiting is shady.

One thing I struggle with for that is how do I measure 400 meters? Do you go to a track? or is there something I'm missing? Sorry, I guess I'm just really clueless.

Edit: I forgot for a second that Google exists. Sorry!!! I am going to take your advice and try this out!"
CVS,fege5oa,t3_eoxa1r,1579089577.0,"I love seeing this post too. I remember people at my store always getting frustrated with new people and having no patience for them. It sounds like you treat your new employee with kindness. Which is important. This job is very hard to learn. 

Thanks for the positive post!"
Resume,fedekom,t3_eoelzb,1579009361.0,"Honestly, the best thing to do is not worry about it. You know now, so just move forward and submit as a PDF from now on. At least you figured it out! 

Also, I'm not sure I agree with everyone on here who seems to think it's a hard and fast ""No"" just because you didn't do a PDF. I could see some people not really caring. You'll never know what they'll think, and you can't change what you've already done, so just move on and do your best."
TrueOffMyChest,fe9gonj,t1_fe8v6qa,1578937385.0,:) I didn't think you were being snappy! Good day to you too!

TrueOffMyChest,fe7r6rk,t1_fe6a047,1578918243.0,I was a server in a state (NJ) where servers earn $2 an hour. It was a small restaurant that wasnt very busy. Some days id work for 10 hours and make like $50 for the whole day.
careerguidance,fe7pg05,t1_fe32qfh,1578917714.0,Sounds like a plan! I know it suckkks getting rejected constantly. Just remember you only need 1 yes. It doesn't matter how many nos you get. And getting rejected means you're trying!

careerguidance,fe21wbn,t3_enipc5,1578833612.0,"I'm a writer too. I eventually got a job as a copywriter at a digital marketing agency. Some ideas I have:

*Decide what job you want. I know you said you want to write anything. It might sound counterintuitive but youll probably have more luck if you choose something specific and take steps to get there.

*stop saying things like ""i have no experience & I cant get hired."" Neither is true. Have some self confidence! (I know it isnt that easy)

Try to do an internship at a place that's similar to where you want to work.

Start a blog on wordpress.com and write about something youre passionate about.

Write for a local newspaper.

Edit: forgot to mention how i got started! My path was a little nuts. Graduated in dec of 2014. Couldnt find a job in the first 6 months so i got a TESOL certificate and taught English in South korea. I thought id become an esl teacher but my boss in Korea was a total asshole and i got verbally/emotionally abused and threatened by him constantly so i came home after 2 months, my contract was 1 year. I got a job answering phones for a bank and writing for a newspaper on the side and spent all my free time applying for jobs and after about 4 months, i finally got one, the job I mentioned at the top of this post.

I also had a lot of help from the alumni center at my school. The woman there was great and instrumental in my job search. Very helpful and encouraging."
