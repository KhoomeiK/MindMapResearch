GODZILLA,ff6t0xo,t3_erl9xu,1579634279.0,"I'd say a solid 6.5/10. I absolutely love the movie but Im also objective enough to be able to see it's flaws. There was unnecessary comedy in the film with too many one liners and quips (Dr Stanton being the worst for this) so it kind of took away from the gravity of what was happening. 

I also think the story on the human side was a bit corny and the whole ""avenging my dead son"" was a bit overly grandiose. 

I also hated how they kept cutting away from big titan fights to deliver more human exposition. It's a Godzilla movie. About monsters. And you're cutting away from the titular monsters every twenty seconds just to show me some more bullshit about how Millie Bobbie Brown is still sad. Like gtfo. 

As such, the pacing was really odd. The editing certainly didn't help (Godzilla throwing ghidorah scene being spliced in half just do they could insert two seconds of scared looking humans). 

I also really didn't like how Dougherty kept covering up the new Legendary Godzilla roar in favour of constantly shoving classic Toho roars over top. We like the legendary roar. Stop covering it up. 

That all being said, it's a movie that is greater than the sum of its parts. I've seen it several times now and always enjoy it. The fights, when we get to see them, are awesome, and the respect given to monster designs is amazing."
