depression,fcukh2y,t1_fcuib7o,1577983023.0,"Yea I agree with that, but how about never getting what we wanted, then it has to be a problem in me and so I can't be glad about this. It would be ok if I thought she was the promlem here, but I don't, I was too anxious, shy and depressed and thats something I have faild to fix over the years. I rearely like someone and rearely feel like people like me, but this once I felt that way, we build the connection over the past year and it was good for me because im slow with this kind of stuff, and then all of a sudden she left me and here I thought she felt the same connection as I did, she left just like that after all we talked about, all the lies she said, gone and when I look back its possible she didnt really care, I might have been too slow, but I tried, god I tried so hard, to be funny and ineteresting around her, despite my awful life, but she was the best thing in my life and i knew i shouldnt tie myself to her this much because i knew this was gonna hurt.. 

Thanks for the comment I told you all this because I feel like you undetstand my situation."

depression,fcu5em6,t3_eiy5xo,1577972983.0,"Bro, I can't even explain how much I relate to you. This morning the girl I was going out with the past few months told me it was over, I also didn't see her this december because she didn't talk to me, she found a boyfriend yesterday, and left me, probably because my anexiety and depression even tho I always tried, god I tried so hard, to be funny and interesting around her despite my awful life, she moved on in a week and found someone else, I remember telling her how I dreamt of her ignoring me and how much it hurt me, and not long after that happened.. Why? I was just not enough, not enough in my own oppinion, which made me shy and to slow which forced her away at the end. She used to tell me how she will wait for me and that she wont look for anyone else because she found me and then this happened. I was depressed before partly because I knew this is the most possible outcome and yet I was so attached to her and I knew things will get worse, but how could have I done anything differently when she was the only good in my life, all the things she told me all the lies, and I still cant blame her, I can only blame myself which makes it so much harder. Bro I feel you. Why can't  they understand that we will be there for them but we need help too, just a little time, just a little understanding, why so cold. I really dont know what to do because nothing seems exciting and knowing myself it never will.

Drugs and dreams, thats all I can think of but it doesnt help much, I wish I had better life so I can grief properly but I don't.. Anyways Im sorry for you man, Im here feeling similar..."
