TwoXChromosomes,ffpftjo,t3_eu829x,1580093989.0,"Your first sentence resonated with me the most. I know that many men out there don’t get praise or compliments, which is really sad. However, I can’t tell you how exhausting it is for my SO to do SOME of the dishes, or SOME of the laundry, and expect the highest praise in the land for it. Sorry, but he needs to do better. I promise that I’m not being overly critical but when I do a whole day of errands and chores that simply need to be done, I don’t want praise for it. I certainly won’t praise him for doing less than the bare minimum. Also, I want him to join me and either help out with separate chores, or for him to assist me with splitting the same chores. I don’t want a bunch of “Yay we did so much!”s peppered all around our conversations, when it takes all my effort not to snap and reply “No, I did it. I initiated and you half helped just so you could claim some portion of credit and feel justified for staying on your computer for 14 hours a day.”  He doesn’t get praise for normalcy. 

Sorry for the rant. I’ve clearly got issues and need help expressing this to him :("

CatAdvice,febacag,t3_enwzo4,1578956873.0,"Ohhhhh yes, one of my cats in particular LOVES to chew on things.  Mostly paper and cardboard, but she also chews on the wooden handles of toys if we leave them out.  She chews on tissues and books as well, and will shred them like crazy.  Any toys with feathers, tails, limbs, or ears gets decimated within days.  We are considering getting something similar to dog chew toys, but haven't bitten the bullet.  For now, if you haven't already, I would definitely keep things you don't want to be chewed on out of reach.  Just put it away in a drawer or closet and keep the doors shut at all times.  Toys are meant to be played with, but Q tips and straws are not."

rurounikenshin,fe8ubo7,t3_eo3e1d,1578931008.0,"Bringing back Shishio would be kinda terrible writing, on the account that not only is he glad to be in hell, like u/KurtZysa said, but his body was burnt to a crisp, and there were several witnesses to his death.  Outside of actual necromancy, I don't see how that's possible in-universe.  And besides, that was the whole point of how Shishio was seen as this all-powerful, terrifying figure-- he didn't die even after the government shot him in the head and burned his body.  He was already considered a kind of ""undead"", and being wrapped in bandages like a mummy helped solidify that aspect too.  No need to rehash what was already done well enough ;P"

CatAdvice,fd6cgyt,t1_fd4rz8p,1578188858.0,"I know that all cats are different, and that's fine.  I'm not trying to change them into completely different cats, but more accepting the few good times I do get from them.  It just really lets me down when I go to pet the male kitty and he will quick as lightning whip his back paw up and push me away hard, then hold me away with his front paws if I'm still around.  He's very forceful/firm about it 90% of the time :/  Being able to touch his belly is extremely rare, but it is nice and soft.  Perhaps one day he may tolerate it, but that day is not today haha :P"
CatAdvice,fd6ba45,t1_fd6a74j,1578188344.0,"I've been trying to be more conscious today (since making this post) about letting them sniff my hand.  They can be very skittish if they don't see my hand coming, so I always make sure it's in their line of sight before even moving closer to them.  Otherwise, they're jumping  a mile high and any petting is definitely NOT happening!  They will jump up on the couch, but only to either pass through elsewhere or to curl up on the far side away from me.  I suppose getting closer will just take time.  They do curl up on my sweaters or my bf's jacket, so I know they like our smell.  I just want them to realize that it's okay to lay next to me or on me!  Your cat sounds adorable btw :)"
CatAdvice,fd4sqzs,t1_fd49j0v,1578170784.0,"They both see the brush as a chew toy, or just something to swat at, so not really, haha.  He definitely likes treats, so I suppose that will have to be the way to go.  I just don't fancy the thought of filling him up with those.  He's already quite fat!"

Perhaps it is a case of being generally overwhelmed.  He will, at most, sniff my hand and that's about it.  His sister will sniff, bump her head against me, and rub her whole body against my leg.  If that's how they are, then it's definitely a me problem; I just need to get used to it."
books,fcatoyj,t3_egqxbb,1577576407.0,"I don’t even know if this counts but I loved all the footnotes in the Bartimaeus trilogy. It was something really unique that I had never seen before, not counting the Bible. It gave a new facet of narrative that rounded out the story from his POV."
