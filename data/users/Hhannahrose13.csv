depression,fdp1eae,t3_emj10f,1578617695.0,"you're right bro. fuck maturity and harsh judgement. like maturity is boring. I'm a freshman in college who likes cats and other cute things and watching anime and playing nice aesthetic video games and watching cartoons like Steven universe and the amazing world of gumball. my family will often ask me if i know who a person is like that was an old actor from the 80s or if ive seen a certain show. when i say no they're like you need to stop watching cartoons and playing games and focus on the real world. well so-rry that i like what i watch and absorb into my brain to be pretty and colorful and beautiful and happy instead of watching shows with real human actors. you don't know who sasuke is. i don't know who you know. we live in different times. maturity should be based on who you are alone and your own progress on the world. it shouldn't be based on other's. and fuck people who would judge someone harshly by the way they look or act. like so what if i like naruto running through the halls or heelying to my next class. it's much more fun than whatever ""mature"" thing you're doing. i just wanna enjoy my own life and be happy and you can enjoy your life and be happy"

AskReddit,fbxpu2r,t3_ef1w5q,1577197092.0,"my boyfriend (19) of almost a year and his family has been going through a really rough patch monetarily. he has four younger brothers (15) (15) (10) (4) and loves with his mom and dad. hiss dad has lost two jobs in Judy a free months and doesn't buy anything from the family and hasn't gotten anything for his children for Christmas for the past few years. his mom is basically the only person who takes care of the children. my bf has become the second source of income for his family giving any money that he makes to his mom or going out himself and buying groceries for the family. his mom works her hardest for the family and they live on food stamps and through the months, I've seen them struggle to even feed the rest of the family and to pay phone bills and for gas. just yesterday, my bf told me that he was gonna be gone for a while bc of his mental state and bc he was going to be trying to make money in any way that he could. i asked him what happened and he said that his mom tried to buy food at the grocery store and her cards got declined. i don't know how much food they have left at home but it hurts my heart that they can't even buy food to eat this close to Christmas. and i hate to think about his little brothers not getting anything under the tree for Christmas. i tried to send him some money but 1. I'm broke af too and 2. the card that i thought had money on it was empty. so here's my request: if anyone can spare any money at all that would help so much
if you can spare anything, his PayPal is
