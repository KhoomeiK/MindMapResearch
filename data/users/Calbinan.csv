If he was single, I'd say it was just a personal space thing, and maybe he was trying to send a signal hoping you would initiate something. Though if he's still doing this even though he's ""occupied"" with someone, it's still a red flag.

It's also possible he doesn't really mean anything by it, but just likes touching you. Maybe he tried it once, you didn't object, so he kept doing it because touching girls is just the best. I'm not saying that's necessarily okay, just saying it might be that simple. This may be worth an awkward conversation with him."

Next time some asshole decides killing you for the cash in your pocket would be better than getting a job, just let the fellow make his own way in life. 

I'll grant you it would be better to end the fight without killing your opponent, but sometimes it just can't happen that way. If you've ever fought a guy who's high on a cocktail of hard drugs, you may notice that non-lethal force isn't enough to stop him. You can find videos of cops tazing and shooting these people, to little or no effect.

Personally, if someone puts me in a situation where I have to kill or be killed, I would prefer that the murderous asshole who started the fight is the one at the losing end of it."

Magic makes your gameplay much easier than a college degree. Some say too easy. 

The RoM gameplay is carried out into your normal gameplay, your house life, out and about, etc. Your spells are always available to you, and you'll often run into other spellcasters, and you have magic interactions with them.

Advice,fekaj68,t3_epm8td,1579196013.0,"I have two ideas.

1: Some therapists, (I'm not one,) might encourage baby steps. Pushing yourself into situations that bring up the trauma, and slowly acclimating to it.

Practice with the highway. Get on the highway, and then get off at the very next exit. Get back on, get back off. Just spend an hour or two doing that over and over, until you can handle it. Then later, try driving longer. It might begin to feel like a normal thing again.

2: Acting and improv are great ways to learn not to give a shit. I used to have terrible social anxiety. I was diagnosed with a social phobia because it was affecting my ability to function. I pushed myself into both of these things, and after growing pains, I can shrug off stressful social situation and embarrassments easily. Job interviews, dates, shitting myself in public on the walk home from Denny's a while ago, whatever.

Acting is usually a class, which would cost you. You're more likely to find an improv group that you can just join up with for free. Most groups will let you sit in and watch, so you can acclimate to it and learn how their games work. Eventually, try to participate in some of the simpler things they do. 

It might be terrifying at first. You might suck at it, but if you can push yourself to tough it out and participate, I'd bet money you'll see some improvement."
