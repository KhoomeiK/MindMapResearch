AskReddit,ffcnzd1,t3_esvgbn,1579803513.0,"Not the worst, but the night before last I had a dream that 3 guys who looked like a maintenance team came to my apartment (not unusual). One of them let himself in, the other two guys stood by the door. I was chilling on the couch with my sister.

The only equipment this guy had was a giant butcher’s knife. When I looked alarmed as he walked by he was like lol what do you think I’m gonna stab you?

He kept walking into the kitchen and I kept reading but then suddenly he was in front of me and laughing like he was messing with me but actually trying to stab me in the neck while I was shielding myself with a paperback book and my sister was apparently unaware that I was getting murdered :("
AskReddit,ff38468,t3_erdnes,1579535935.0,"Others have accurately pointed out that, in the west, there’s more familiarity, it’s punching up rather than down, etc, but another thing worth pointing out...

With any demographic, the best jokes at that group’s expense are going to be funniest *to members of that group.* As a non-religious example, look at Ron Swanson from Parks & Recreation: he’s a caricature of libertarianism, but most libertarians I know find him hilarious. He was clearly written by people who knew enough about libertarianism to exaggerate it in a way that would be especially funny to people familiar with the ideology.

Look at well-received media which does contain humor around non-Christian religions—eg Marvelous Mrs Maisel (Judaism) and Ramy (Islam). The jokes are actually funny, not just “hurr durr Jews are cheap” or “hurr durr Muslims are backwards.” The writing is informed by knowledge of the religion and its surrounding culture because the writing teams and casts include current or former members of those religions.

In the US, it’s tough to find a writing team and cast which *doesn’t* contain current or former Christians, so the jokes are likely going to be more informed than “hurr durr christians are stupid.” It’s more commonplace because it’s just statistically easier to get decent writing."
fatlogic,ff13hz7,t1_ff10qoo,1579474809.0,"I just don’t think that’s the implication of the initial post. I don’t think it’s worth debating, so we can agree to disagree here, but my takeaway from that part of the “translation” is that someone may have lost weight for reasons you’re not aware of, and when you compliment that, this is what it might mean to them. Saying that the original poster is implying that everyone who says this has malicious intent strikes me as a bit of a strawman tbh

I’ve lost weight in the past due to personal circumstances (eating disorder, depression, grief), and it’s really awkward to receive compliments on it. I know the person may mean well, but what they’re complimenting me on is something I don’t want praise for, but which may be too personal to disclose. If that’s FA rhetoric, then it’s one of the few instances where they’re right."
fatlogic,ff0w5xl,t1_ff0m5nk,1579472824.0,"Yeah, these sorts of posts pop up here regularly, but I don’t think they’re fatlogic. If someone has discussed their weight loss goals with you, absolutely compliment them, but otherwise, yeah, you have no idea why they lost the weight and shouldn’t comment. In general, unsolicited comments on other people’s bodies aren’t polite."
AmITheAngel,ff0n9r2,t1_ff0d45n,1579470493.0,"OP said he has a tradition which his sister is aware of: celebrating good news by ordering himself a special pizza. He does this when the bully dies, she comes home and understands immediately that he’s celebrating her friend’s brother’s death. Sure, he wasn’t throwing a party in the streets, but he also clearly said that he was celebrating that the bully died, not just being free of the bully’s behavior.

To be clear, I don’t think OP is a bad person, he’s just young and in pain. But a bevy of internet strangers validating his bitter, vindictive outlook is not healthy. What the kid needs is therapy."

offmychest,ff006tq,t1_fezunsl,1579463715.0,"Thanks for the empathy. It sucks feeling this way, but it’s comforting to know others have been/are here too. Even though it doesn’t feel real right now, I choose to believe that things can get better, and I’m gonna do what I can to facilitate that. Good luck getting through this, it’s such a shitty state of existence."
fatlogic,fez57p8,t1_feyon1j,1579453964.0,Right?? Why can’t my vices and dependencies be repackaged like this :(
AmITheAngel,feyt7zt,t1_feypqnm,1579450286.0,"Ugh yes—like that one where OP‘s “bully”—a teenager—died, and he was openly celebrating in front of his sister, who was best friends with the bully’s older sister? And his sister was a traitor for crying with the her friend who lost her brother? And OP wouldn’t even acknowledge that the kid could’ve outgrown it, because “once a bully, always a bully”?

At the time I looked, everyone was saying NTA, because “fuck bullies,” and “sure you were obviously celebrating this child’s death but you didn’t SAY what you were celebrating til your sister asked.”"
AmItheAsshole,feka89e,t1_fejpzgo,1579195835.0,"Studies have shown that adults who have autism are more likely to prefer “identity-first terminology,” and that it’s generally parents/relatives who are insisting that’s offensive. The main argument in favor of this is that autism isn’t something inherently bad which we need to separate from the person, it’s a part of who they are, and it’s no more offensive to say that someone is autistic than to say that they’re Canadian.

Obviously there’s no universal opinion and it’s important to respect individual preferences when referring to a specific person. But saying that it’s unilaterally not ok to use anything other than person-first terminology ignores self-advocacy and centers non-autistic voices.

AskReddit,feiq74i,t3_eparjn,1579144471.0,"Compulsively trying to please everybody.

It’s resulted in me being taken advantage of, staying in toxic relationships, shrugging off sexual harassment, etc. Also, while most people I know see me as very empathetic and kind, I’m genuinely not sure how much it is empathy vs fear of upsetting people."
fatlogic,feip0p4,t3_epajry,1579143673.0,"A private healthcare provider doesn’t care about your health or your weight. They care about making a profit. Your premium reflects their expected cost, and weight is an easily measured indicator of that. United doesn’t care about your BMI because they hate fat people; they care because they hate losing money.

I strongly believe that healthcare should be universally available, but I also think it’s important to maintain incentives against actions which increase the anticipated future cost. Nothing prohibitive—no matter how much you overeat, how many cigarettes you smoke, how much booze you drink, you still deserve healthcare—but enough that, if your actions are likely to increase the burden on taxpayers, you’re impacted accordingly."

AskReddit,fecg36o,t1_fecfute,1578973071.0,"Machiavellian means “cunning, scheming, and unscrupulous, especially in politics.” Think smart, socially savvy, and unscrupulous, like Littlefinger in Game of Thrones.

Comes from Niccolo Machiavelli, the author of “The Prince,” a Renaissance-era book about political pragmatism."
fatlogic,fdomsf4,t1_fdom9h0,1578608333.0,"Oh I agree 100%, definitely not in good health. Given that she doesn’t seem to be pushing the idea that being overweight is healthy, I don’t see that as being my business, but when other people start pushing it for her, well... that’s a big yikes."
fatlogic,fdomka7,t1_fdocq0k,1578608199.0,"Thing is, the type of person who frames their outlook on life in terms of how the whole world is against them for being fat—ie, the type of person who’d volunteer for this article—is much more likely to be emotionally fragile.

The phrase “victim mentality” is thrown around a lot, but it 100% applies here. You’re interviewing someone who thinks clothing sizes are bigoted? Of course they’re gonna cry when they talk about every rude comment they’ve ever heard."
fatlogic,fdoltms,t1_fdoj7e7,1578607758.0,"Yeah, it looks like they’re offering Lizzo as a counterpoint to the argument that fat people are unhealthy: “Most people can’t even go up 2 flights of stairs, but Lizzo can dance! Checkmate fatphobes!”

For the record, I love Lizzo. She’s obviously not in the best health, but I’ve never seen her shill fatlogic. Some people just see any plus size woman who loves herself as naturally supportive of all “fat activism.”"

fatlogic,fbxrcww,t3_eewkvm,1577198380.0,"Oh, come on. This person isn’t demanding that the menu erase the calorie counts, she’s just commenting that she, individually, has to remind herself that she’s not being judged by a piece of paper. That’s a super common sentiment among ED survivors. Calorie counts ARE legitimately triggering to some people, they just need to handle it on an individual basis, which this person seems to be doing.

A quick look at this her blog/insta confirms that she’s not a fat activist (or fat at all). She seems to just be promoting healthy eating/meal prep without calorie counting. And again, if you have a history of disordered eating, counting calories could legitimately trigger a relapse."
