Embroidery,ffojeex,t3_eu6zan,1580078300.0,I LOVE this! Absolutely stunning work.
Embroidery,ffneiu2,t1_ffmlmhu,1580064916.0,Thanks so much! I was wondering how I was going to do the knots!
youseeingthisshit,ffm8hnn,t3_eu47t2,1580050316.0,"I know someone made a comment about my response about this being creepy. I can't see it. However I just want to say, I do realize this woman is likely suffering from an illness. I worked in a nursing home for years until I was unable to work at all. I took care of many patients with many mental disabilities including dementia. It is one of the cruelest diseases I could ever image. My heart does go out to this poor woman. So I apologize if my statement seemed heartless. With that being said, I still find this unsettling."
Parenting,ffl3g8d,t3_eu3fw2,1580034107.0,"I was in a very similar situation. My husband and I got married when my son was 3. My son bio father has never wanted anything to do with him. And that's fine. My husband and I decided when our son was old enough we would tell him. And we did, we were completely honest without bashing his bio father. We told our son if he ever wanted to seek out his bio then he could and we would help him and support him in any way we could. From day one our son has always said that he has a dad. And has no desire to seek out his bio father. But he knows if he ever changes his mind he has our support. I think being honest and transparent about the situation was best for our family. Everyone is different of course, but I have always felt that if we would have hid it that it might have caused some animosity . I hope this helps. Good luck!"
Eyebleach,ffl0gbc,t3_eu44zt,1580032511.0,This brought tears to my eyes. My great nephew has autism and his dog passed recently. Its been so hard for him.
youseeingthisshit,ffkzqb9,t3_eu47t2,1580032136.0,This is creepy as hell. Even if by some off chance it's fake. Still creepy. I won't be going back to sleep now damnit!
mildlyinfuriating,ffkz8mu,t1_ffkvwal,1580031853.0,I was wondering the same thing.

Embroidery,ffiv4or,t1_ffipb1q,1579983472.0,"Not normally no. My husband gave me his grandmas embroidery machine, I can use it But it also scares me a little! Aside from that I just REALLY like doing it by hand. Its very calming. But there are so many of these patterns I would love to do them. So I'm gonna take your advice and give it a go! Thank you!"

Embroidery,ffhb68l,t1_ffha784,1579928550.0,I was surprised to! It turned out to be really good. It was a little slow to start out. But I ended up really enjoying it.

awfuleverything,ffdvmdm,t1_ffdavwh,1579830037.0,Well said!
awfuleverything,ffd1yid,t1_ffccy68,1579811819.0,It's good that you do have someone that you are so close to. No matter if you are blood or not.
awfuleverything,ffd1u2z,t1_ffcwq4v,1579811751.0,"I honestly don't think that people stop to think of what they tell their kids to grow a set means. It does often turn out the way it happened to you. They turn into the bully. My son is a kind hearted guy, but these past few years have made him start to grow into a bitter young man. That really dislikes alot of people. And that is just sad to me."
awfuleverything,ffd1ao9,t1_ffcjjem,1579811451.0,I completely agree. The way the schools say that they have zero tolerance is shit. I talked with the principal multiple times last year he said he had no idea. I responded with may be He should get out from behind his desk. The middle school my son goes to is known for the bullying. Sadly it's our only option. My son is so excited to go to high school next year. He has a lot of friends in a grade higher from his wrestling team. Aside from that he says he is just ready to get out of hell. I hope that things turn around for your girls. I hate that they are having to deal with that crap!
awfuleverything,ffccvz2,t1_ffccncs,1579796727.0,Personally I don't see someone as being weak if they decide to be kind. In fact being a caring person is literally the hardest thing to do some days.
awfuleverything,ffccr6e,t1_ffccnf0,1579796644.0,Well I'm happy I could brighten your week just a little! And I know huh! My dad is short too so its all his fault LOL
awfuleverything,ffccmtw,t1_ffcapoi,1579796569.0,I know!! I could NEVER think of doing something like that to another living creature. I don't understand how their brain gets there. And what happened to them to make them so mean. Its awful.
awfuleverything,ffcchiw,t1_ffc8bne,1579796478.0,"No it wasn't my fault, but sometimes someone needs to apologize for the way people treat others. And yep it sure was, I was bullied until high school. Mainly because of how small I was and still am. Sadly it's the same exact reason my son is being bullied. Although he is already taller then I was at his age lol!"
awfuleverything,ffc890m,t1_ffc85e6,1579793801.0,I'm sorry you were treated that way. And apparently teaching kids to be good people isn't a thing
awfuleverything,ffc856v,t1_ffc7z3s,1579793731.0,I don't think bullying of any sort is fine. But that's just my opinion and everyone is entitled to have one.
awfuleverything,ffc81bp,t1_ffc74nf,1579793663.0,"Exactly!! It's awful how people respond to our kids getting bullied. The other thing that gets on my last damn nerve is the ""boys will be boys"" that's just a bunch of BS! Teach your kids how to not be asshats!"
awfuleverything,ffbzbss,t1_ffbvxcj,1579787472.0,"I understand what you are saying. And don't always disagree. However my 14 yr old son has been both physically and verbally bullied since starting middle school. I cannot tell you the sheer number times that I've been told that he needs to toughen up. And that he has been told to fight. And that this wouldn't be happening to him if he would just start ""kicking some ass"" I just personally think that it's victim blaming. Just like saying to a woman whose SO verbally abused them. Bruises will heal, words don't always. Ive been in those relationships. I finally broke the cycle. But as I said, I do see your point."
cats,ffbtvmr,t3_esrwbs,1579782561.0,I thought it was just my cat that used pads.
awfuleverything,ffbttgr,t3_esry5f,1579782502.0,"Poor child. It's terrible how the children treat others. And I know this may not be taken well. But I'm so sick of the children who are being bullied being told that they need to toughen up, get over it, grow a spine or any other nonsense that is said. Fact is that I see it as just one more thing that the victim is blamed for something terrible that happens at the hands of someone else! I also feel that most, not all, but most kids learn their behaviour from their parents."
SphynxCats,ff8wkeq,t3_eo6arc,1579698454.0,Frequently.

cats,ff8qn41,t3_es4l7m,1579692051.0,My son just turned 14 and has started having issues with depression. His cat does the very same thing with him. Especially on really rough days. Im so happy that you have such a great kitty to help you!

insanepeoplefacebook,feqv4dd,t1_fepjbmp,1579346398.0,I am glad I'm not the only one!
mildlyinfuriating,feqndzo,t3_eq2tm0,1579343908.0,Just wanted you to know you are not alone! Mine does the same freaking thing! So I spend most of my time sick as a freaking dog! I'm so sorry you have to go thru this as well as damn chemo. Insurance companies suck. But I try to keep telling myself it could be worse. Feel better friend!
Embroidery,fels11z,t1_felrkch,1579229510.0,Yeah I just finished a piece that had a bunch of knots. I love how it turned out but it seemed like it took me forever !

ShitMomGroupsSay,feka2iq,t3_epm2dm,1579195741.0,Yeah that shit didn't happen. Or he needs a new Dr because his is a broken idiot!

gofundme,fejjbb3,t1_fejivz7,1579176669.0,Yes ma'am I have. And I've filled out the in house financial help. So fingers crossed on that front. I also have household bills that will need paid. At this time we just don't know how much lasting damage there will be. I'm waiting to hear back from state insurance and will have an interview with them to see about it.  I appreciate so much you taking the time to respond and for your help and suggestion.
CrossStitch,feiyuqk,t3_ejt17s,1579151090.0,What a great idea!

blackcats,fe7k3b9,t3_enxwjl,1578915688.0,You have some beautiful plants and house panther ! I've found that keeping my kids and furbabies alive is all I can do. My plants are and have been screwed since the kids came lol!
Eyebleach,fe7ju8t,t3_enwnoj,1578915584.0,I have never wanted to be a fence painter more in my life.
CrossStitch,fe7hfe2,t3_enyack,1578914501.0,Ok so I REALLY need to make this for my husband. Long story short. We just got of the ICU for accidental Tylenol liver shock. We are thankfully out of the scary part. The reason this is so funny. Aside from me watching the shows....they legit asked him if I would ever hurt him!!!!
insaneparents,fdsp6pw,t1_fds45ty,1578706150.0,I was just thinking the same thing. But I'm sitting in ICU. Nothing will phase me LOL!!
shittytattoos,fdslsz8,t1_fdrauk7,1578704856.0,"We want so badly for our kids to be safe. To me that includes EVERTYTHING they may decide to do. Especially since we have tattoos and it's just is normal for us, and a large bunch of my family!"
blackcats,fdnp0yg,t1_fdnh6m3,1578590212.0,You're welcome !
shittytattoos,fdnoyuf,t1_fdnlb1r,1578590185.0,I have never understood parents who would rather be preachy about tattoos. The art ass been around for thousands of years. And if your kid wants to do it then they should be told how dangerous it is to not have them done the proper way. But sadly it isn't like that and so many get tats that they regret like your cousin. Which by the way I'm so sorry for your loss. All of mine have been done in shops. Some have really faded over the years and need to be redone. But I don't regret any of them.
blackcats,fdnfrb0,t3_em94zy,1578584859.0,They are beautiful!
cats,fdnfoc4,t3_ema20o,1578584808.0,Good luck Max!! Well wishes to you both! You are doing a great job! And he will be a badass pirate!
insanepeoplefacebook,fdneadf,t3_em7ux1,1578583959.0,I just don't understand why some people have to be so freaking awful to each other. They need to find a hobby besides being complete asshats!
Embroidery,fdn5wdn,t3_em2jza,1578578162.0,Very cute! Well done!
Embroidery,fdn5c0f,t3_elzn2a,1578577714.0,I really love this pattern!
Embroidery,fdn58tg,t3_em5m18,1578577643.0,That's VERY pretty!!
shittytattoos,fdlx6v8,t1_fdksyxz,1578534644.0,"I agree, on both accounts. I would have torn his face off. And thankfully both of my daughter's learned from me drilling it into their heads. That if they were going to get any ink it had better be in a shop, by someone that knew what they were doing. And that they themselves had looked into the artist beforehand and liked their work! My husband has a horrid tattoo on his arm that makes me and my niece ( who is a tattoo artist and owns her own shop) cringe every time I see it lol."
toxicparents,fdinvyg,t1_fbsxqw5,1578447095.0,Thank you so much! This past year I've felt so much exclusion from them and my stepmother. My dad just falls in line. He has cancer as well and frankly I just think he is tired. Still it's hurtful. And by extension it is happening to my son. I have four kids but he is the youngest and my only biological child. He was sick with pneumonia and spent his bday in bed. None of them called or anything. So at this point I'm just done with the lot of them. I try to always attend their kids bday parties and my oldest sisters grandchildren as well. Its not even about gifts. Its just the principal of it all. I appreciate your well wishes and I hope you had a great holiday And new year!
shittytattoos,fdhn2p9,t1_fdhkt3l,1578426134.0,"LOL luckily mine is well done. I think if it looked like the one above I would probably chop off the ""artist"" head and then cut my skin off. I have always been so so careful to do my research before I let anyone put something permanent on my body!!"
shittytattoos,fdgvk26,t1_fdgfd5u,1578409395.0,"Hey now..That hurts! LOL  I have a shamrock with my son's name and date of birth on my shoulder. I've never done crack, I had a great career until I was unable to work. And I don't think I'm white trash. I just really like well done tattoos."
Embroidery,fdgv55z,t3_el27vq,1578409099.0,The only feedback I can give ya is this....They are freaking adorable ! You did a great job!
cats,fdgv1ez,t1_fdguwbw,1578409027.0,"Thank you! She is a little bit of a bitch sometimes. She didn't want her sisters getting the toys, she sat like that for nearly a hour until they all got tired and needed a nap!"
EntitledBitch,fdgfsb3,t3_ejsynq,1578394798.0,People can be so uncaring. When I lost my hair from chemo I started either wearing a scarf or wig. Sometimes I would just rock the bald head. So anyway last thanksgiving my daddy made the comment that he liked the wig I was wearing. My baby sister actually said...well now you get attention. People can be a bitch. Lol
