depression,fejqtbg,t3_cml6ni,1579183530.0,I woke up in the middle of the night and all I want to do is cry. I realized that I have people who care so much about me and my happiness and I never really understood why before.
depression,fejqnac,t3_epemgf,1579183398.0,I’m very proud of you!! I try to keep my room clean throughout the day but I haven’t cleaned in weeks either. Thank you though for motivating me :) I sometimes forget there are good times

ucr,fdhg1l2,t3_eletvu,1578421873.0,There are a handful of people who realize they are not prepared for college and that’s okay. So a lot of them drop out or take a quarter off
depression,fdfzk2n,t3_ekwbox,1578374738.0,These past few days have been really hard on me. I’ve caused a lot of pain on people I care about and I don’t really know who to talk to about it. I feel like talking about these things just causes me to hinder them and worry. But sometimes I just want to give up. It’s really hard sometimes you know.
SuicideWatch,fdfed8m,t3_el0pqb,1578359720.0,I’m sorry about your boyfriend. I can only imagine the pain and heartache that you are currently enduring and I’m proud of you. I’m sorry that I don’t have anything else to say but you are loved and time will help you heal.
SuicideWatch,fdfe50j,t3_el0ny6,1578359569.0,There are times when I’m doing something or even nothing at all and I’d just wish I’d get hit by a car or just drop dead. I don’t feel like I belong here or anywhere really. I know I have my friends and family but I know they’re all doing their own thing and that’s not a bad thing you know. I love that for them and I’m happy for them. But there are times when I just feel really bitter and envy how normal or at least seemingly normal they are. No mental health issues. No voices telling them what a piece of shit they are and how they’ll never amount to anything. I wish I could have that. I wish I could be content. I wish I could just be happy.
depression,fdf9i2j,t3_el1q99,1578356444.0,Hey I’m really proud of you!!! I haven’t cut in a few weeks but there are definitely times when I feel so low and want to focus on something else that it gets tempting but I’m doing my best to stay strong.
depression,fdf9ef2,t3_eksxke,1578356376.0,"Hey I totally understand what you’re going through because I went through that in high school. My parents thought I was crazy and have never felt more alone in my entire life. I remember in the morning when my mom would take me to school she would just yell at me nonstop telling me how much of a slut I was and how I wasn’t gonna amount to anything. It hurt a lot and it sucks. 

I’m sorry that this happened to you. You don’t deserve to be yelled at for two hours. It’s not your fault that they are the way they are. I get it. Existing is shit. We never asked for it yet here we are. I hate it. But you shouldn’t kill yourself. You just have to accept that some people just can’t be reasoned with and it sucks."
depression,fdf8gfx,t1_fd4s6f9,1578355737.0,That’s the thing. I never feel good enough. But I appreciate the kind words and I’m always here too if you need to chat!
depression,fdf86ms,t3_cml6ni,1578355552.0,"Hello, it’s been a few days since I last felt depressed but today I woke up not wanting to get out of bed or eat. My life’s going great and I’m about to graduate college but right now I’m just crying. I hate myself and I hate everything about me. I wish I never existed and I wish I wasn’t alive."
depression,fd2laj6,t3_eju46v,1578148833.0,"I’m really sorry that you feel this way but I understand how you feel. There are times when I don’t feel heard or when I just really hate myself especially how I am. I always fuck things up and I never seem to know how to make things right. 

There are times when I think I should just end it all ngl since everything seems beyond repair but that’d be too good for me."
