eczema,ffxynee,t1_ffxuf3a,1580335006.0,"Its also on her torso, inner elbow, back of knees and her ankles. Im tired of using steroids, they only make it go away, not keep it away. Looking at trying to change her diet to try no inflammatory foods, but shes a picky eater."
eczema,ffwdbdl,t3_evh8qu,1580296425.0,We started using recently on my daughter. Its really saved her skin on her face. Teething drool rash + ezcema really sucks.
socialanxiety,ffwd7vb,t3_evafi5,1580296297.0,I have a great sarcastic sense of humor that causes me to regret things Ive said. Im usually regretting in the middle of the night instead of sleeping.
orlando,ffvg03f,t1_ffv1ycc,1580263241.0,Was that on the 6pm news? Can't find anything on their website about it. I was at Avalon and 50 when tons of cops came to the area. Saw the Osceola sheriff and though oh shit this must be bad.

socialanxiety,feol47d,t3_eq6r70,1579301650.0,I have a hard time talking in a group setting. I end up being the weird quiet one and then anxiety and self consciousness about how I am looked at by others if I don't participate.
socialanxiety,feokvp5,t3_eppuyr,1579301515.0,I'm too shy to outright tell someone I don't like how they did my hair. Conflict avoidance sucks.
GalaxysEdge,fel4am5,t3_epn0fy,1579213752.0,Do they have a show at this stage? When we were there we heard some effects but had to walk away as it was scaring our toddler.

BackstreetBoys,fdn8o98,t3_em1j8x,1578580246.0,"I met them about 10 times back in 1998-1999. They were recording Millennium at a studio very close to my house. I found out they recorded at the place when reading the liner notes to Backstreets Back and saw the name of a studio I knew since it was right by me. About 6 months after reading that they were back working on Millennium. My mom was taking me and a friend to ""Backstreet Boys Day"" in Orlando to see them get the key to the city and when we passed the studio a limo was outside. My mom was bold and stopped by the talk to the limo driver to see who was at the studio. The driver laughed but tried to act like it was nobody famous. A moment later AJ walked out of the building to get into the limo and my friend and I lost our minds. We ended up getting to stay and meet them all as they came out of get into the limo. After that day we just kept bugging them until they were done recording. We figured out what cars they drove and knew when they were there. As an adult, I actually feel really bad about all of this and wish I could apologize to them. They were all very nice to me every time, even when I could tell they may have been annoyed by my presence. Howie and Kevin were always the absolute nicest. AJ was really good too, but he showed some odd behavior and that was before we knew about his issues. Brian and Nick were nice enough lol. I think I remember once Brian tried to politely tell me to give them space and I heard from a friend that knew Howie they considered me to be a stalker. I was a 15 yr old girl who was obsessed and just bugged them too much."
