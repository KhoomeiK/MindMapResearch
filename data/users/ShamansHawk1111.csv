Ayahuasca,fgi4clw,t1_fghpjws,1580804932.0,"Hi, I recently brewed Jurema (Mimosa with Syrian Rue) successfully (at a threshold dose because I didn't want to go in too deep, got exactly what I needed). I read all the forums posts about this specific combination of ingredients before attempting it and succeeding on my second try.

&#x200B;

My advice to you for avoiding mistakes when brewing is \~

\#1 Do not use too little or too much ingredients 

(I calculate 2-3g syrian rue, 3-6g Mimosa first time, & a  squeeze of lemon. Some will agree or disagree. I think this is a safe rule to go by. I also did not grind up the ingredients and still had a significant experience. My successful brew was 2g Syrian Rue seeds and 4.1g Mimosa Hostilis Root Bark. I experienced brief mental chaos, had a light brush with insanity and a sense of a power greater than me, brief vivid textures and pattern recognition, mild closed eye visuals and then 3 hours of beautiful lasting clarity and a cleansed feeling for hours after which included pearl-star like visuals that complimented edges of objects. The most important thing about this was the internal experience of chaos and fear, surrendering to the universe, choosing to connect with God, and this beautiful cleansing that left me with ts clarity, purity and a brighter worldview. Anything stronger than that would have been difficult. 2g Syrian Rue and 4.1g Mimosa did this when brewed correctly)

\#2 Boil or simmer the ingredients thoroughly

 ( it will work whether you separate them or brew them together. I boiled the ingredients together until it reduced to a cup or two of liquid. Poured through strainer into mug or bowl. I used a regular pasta strainer, not a coffee filter, t-shirt or cheesecloth. Those things seem to strain out the alkaloids of interest some times. idk)

\#3 Do at least two washes with your Mimosa 

(Scoop ingredients from strainer back into pot for boiling or simmering a second time. Boil or simmer until reduced. Strain again through pasta strainer into a mug or bowl. You could repeat this step and do a 3rd or even a 4th wash, but I didn't need to.)

\#4 Follow the Ayahuasca/MAOI diet at least 24 solid hours before drinking this. 

(If you cannot avoid soy, red meat, processed foots, fermented foods, SSRI's, or anything else on the freakishly large laundry list of MAOI contraindications, or if you are uncertain of anything, don't drink the brew. You are risking a serious medical emergency when experimenting with MAOI's.)

nutmeg,fg8la7n,t1_fg6uezi,1580623139.0,"To be honest, nutmeg should not be compared to powerful LSD trips. I do not get a powerful LSD feeling from nutmeg. I do see nice motion tracers when waving my hand or seeing passing cars, people, or birds. And I feel immersed in my thoughts on nutmeg, similar to a stoned cannabis day dream with more vivid mental pictures.

I start to really feel nutmeg's pleasant effects 5 hours after dosing. I get a moderate hash or cannabis feeling that lasts all day and slowly gets stronger until I go to sleep. It makes life bearable and pleasant. Nutmeg is more like a stoney nootropic, not a powerful hallucinogen or psychedelic. 

Nutmeg does act as a mild psychedelic like Cannabis, but Nutmeg is not like LSD. You will not get an LSD-like trip from nutmeg alone. But you may feel a gradually increasing pot-brownie high all day. I love that.

To answer your question about calculating a dose for weight, I don't think that's possible unless you mix several grated nut's powders so the powder has EQUAL POTENCY. All nutmeg nuts are unique, similar to how mushrooms and weed nugs are each unique in their size, their weight and their alkaloid content. The best way to find your right dose is to grate a lot of nuts all at once, perhaps in a bowl or container. Mix it up completely to even out the potency and then start testing your doses from there.

Your english is great, by the way. I recommend exploring Whole Nutmeg providers on amazon or other online sites. Try ordering a few different brands. Compare and see which ones work best!

Most of the nutmeg haters are ignorant and just consume Preground nutmeg instead of grating the whole nutmeg nuts. Preground nutmeg powder gives me headaches every time, and sometimes giving me stomach discomfort, with hardly any pleasant effects. 

I also agree that nutmeg can affect people differently like Cannabis or any other plant medicines.

Feeling this giddy feeling, I would slur alot when talking( I was very talkative), which was funny to me but probably weird as hell to anyone around me. None of my DXM experiments were bad to be honest. I still have more delsym and robocough tucked away for the right day.

Personally, I'm sticking with Nutmeg as my regular go-to because it's cheap, euphoric and stoney and happy, makes music sound different too in it's own special nutmeg way, makes activities more immersive, lasts all day til my head hits the pillow, and helps me to open my heart and my mind.

Psychedelics have changed my life for the better too! 

The good quality Whole Nutmeg I use has a similar level of psychedelic activity as middle shelf cannabis, which personally is perfect for me. Nutmeg's psychedelic properties give me a good mood lift, feelings of mild euphoria and lasting well-being, a more POSITIVE WORLDVIEW, and kindling for creative inspiration. Sometimes I get teary from my heart opening on nutmeg, like a psychedelic spiritual cleansing. I experience all these different effects on different levels with different amounts of nutmeg. 1-2g is perfect for work. 7-15g is great for events like going to a themepark, a movie, a night out, a long trip, or even just a lazy stoney day at home playing video games. I LOVE how it lasts all fucking day and takes care of me until my head hits the pillow! I think these tiny doses work well on me because I grate my nutmeg nuts.

To answer your question on the 25 gram dose..... Did you grate or grind your original 15g dose? You do not need to ingest more nutmeg for a stoning effect! 15 grams should be way stronger for you than before if you GRATE the nuts! What brand of Nutmeg do you use? (it's possible your nutmeg may just be low quality, ingesting more will not help that..) 

You need to get a grater, or at least smash them and put them in a coffee grinder. Turn the nuts into powder in some way, because there is more surface area exposing nutmeg's special active oils, making it totally more effective! Wash back with cold water and enjoy. 

On 6 grams of nutmeg and a little black coffee, 4 hours after dosing I see shimmering on striped surfaces like vents and window blinds and I can even see faint patterns dancing between the grooves, and LOTS of motion tracers and mild colorful static, in a mild stoned haze. During this I'll feel happy and calm, maybe even feel giddy or excited if I'm doing something normal like grocery shopping or cooking at home. The whole experience is enjoyable especially with headphones ;)

To answer your question about serotonin depletion, I think too much nutmeg too often is not healthy for your brain or your body. Doses like 1-4 grams daily is not bad at all. But 10+ grams every day for over a week is too much. I get mentally and physically slow from doing too much of it like that. I get perfect results using nutmeg every other day, or 4 days on & 1 day off & repeat. 5 days on & 1 day off is pushing it. Too much nutmeg too often will not help depression, it will make you feel tired. If you find your sweet spot with nutmeg dosage intervals and caffeine, you are set for life!

I'm currently 14 hours into 3 grams of grated nutmeg as of now. Only 3 grams. I feel a nice tingle in my head, body and legs. I also have the munchies. I felt a little irritated at work today but I was definitely not miserable, I was able to be friendly with customers and co-workers and work hard through my shift, without hating life :) and that's all I could ask for. For work I combine Nutmeg with tiny doses of Kratom and L-Theanine as well.

I felt care-free and a bit spaced out and a little drunk, but honestly it's not as good as whole nutmeg to me. 

DXM is an interesting occasional adventure into a spaced out care-free place but it doesn't uplift me or inspire me like weed or whole nutmeg always do. 

Taking more DXM would lead to more Diarrhea and drunk feelings, which is not desirable to me. As a sufferer of depression, I want to feel good, not drunk.

For Whole Nutmeg nuts, don't just eat them. 

Either grate the nuts with a fine(small holes) cheese grater and wash(parachute) back with water. Or smash the nuts, then grind the smashed nuts in an electric coffee grinder and then parachute the powder(harder to swallow than grated nuts). You could mix your grated or grinded nutmeg nuts in oatmeal or applesauce, but that honestly makes me gag... especially with any amount above 2 grams of nutmeg.

For me it's easiest to just grate the nuts by hand, weigh the dose, and wash back with cold water little by little. No gagging, no problems. I'll sit down and grate up to 80 grams of nutmeg in one sitting for a month's worth of dosing, so I don't have to do it every day.


Oh shit, I just remembered my NUTMEG RECIPES!!!
Sometimes.............. I'll get cookie dough from the store and infuse the cookie dough with nutmeg.... by putting one section of dough(one cookie's worth of dough at a time) in a pot on low heat with a tiny smidge of butter and 4-7 grams of grated nutmeg. I'll mix the dough and nutmeg together with a wooden spoon by rolling and kneading it together in the pot. The butter helps the nutmeg powder stick to the cookie dough. Once the dough collects the 4-7 grams of nutmeg powder, I place the dough on the baking sheet to be baked. Bake to desired texture, whether you prefer mooshy cookies, crispy cookies, or right in between. With chocolate chip, the flavor is WONDERFUL when dipped in BLACK COFFEE. That is the ultimate morning ritual. Nutmeg cookie dipped in black coffee. I called them Space Cookies.

An EASIER recipe is to mix your desired amount of grated/grinded Nutmeg powder with PEANUT BUTTER. Put some regular butter in a pan or pot, and mix your nutmeg powder with your preferred amount of peanut butter.... Add sugar to taste :) This one is ADDICTIVE. You can put it in a sandwich with jelly, or just eat it with a spoon! haha I loved this one.

nutmeg,fg2k3u7,t3_ew0352,1580446582.0,"Hi Ssshponged, my short answer is YES, Nutmeg can help you with depression. It helps me. 

&#x200B;

I've been using Whole Nutmeg for about 3 years specifically for depression. I used to always smoke weed for depression but I needed to pass drug tests, and I needed to stop stinking like weed every waking minute of the day because I'm a Dad and need to be responsible. Also, the weed tolerance made it more expensive and less effective. Nutmeg has been a GODSEND to me, and I've written a detailed post about pot alternatives and included Nutmeg on my list. My life has gotten much better, and I've held a job in food service for over a year and I'm almost ready to buy a car! I could not have done this without Nutmeg (or without a solid mental/spiritual foundation). Thanks to Nutmeg for helping me not need weed anymore.

&#x200B;

I've had high doses and microdoses and can explain it all in detail. 

&#x200B;

There's also GOOD(whole) and BAD(preground) nutmeg too.

&#x200B;

I'm eager to share my Nutmeg experience with you to help you with depression, but I'd rather you ask me what you want to know about Nutmeg.

I've read a lot about Datura and Benedryl, and both cause scary insect and haunted ghost hallucinations and make you sick. 

I've taken much higher doses of high quality nutmeg. The only ""spiders"" I've seen were those black lint balls in the carpet looking like black widows in the corner of my eye, which I see sober! haha.

I used to take 19 grams of fresh whole nutmeg 4 times a week and my strongest hallucinations were vivid motion tracers, faces in cooked burgers and chicken nuggets at work, symmetrical textures on walls, hazy translucent static covering everything(like cannabis) and closed eye visual mandalas and geometry. I also experienced Cannabis-like immersive day dreaming, where I feel like I'm almost entering my day dreams and forget where I am on high doses of nutmeg.

Small amounts of weed, small amounts of Nutmeg, small amounts of Kratom, L-Theanine, Kava, and caffeine all individually and in varying combinations all give me just enough relief to feel good and enjoy life. I made a detailed post about all of those, called ""Legal Highs - Finding a Replacement for Weed - Pot Alternative"" and a lot of people responded with questions, personal experience, and opposing opinions, all contributing greatly. I recommend you check this post out if you're interested in legal routes of relief that give a mild ""high"" without fucking you up. After trying Kanna only once, I believe it would fit nicely on my list of pot alternatives.

I got this weird foggy floaty head buzz from it. I felt sort of chilled out and sort of care-free.

It felt good to articulate and express myself.

I would try it again."
Ayahuasca,ffw3jsg,t3_er7cn3,1580282777.0,"Hey guys. I tried Mimosa with Syrian Rue, which we can call Mimosahuasca or Jurema. I overall had a positive experience. It was threshold, yet somehow intense enough to cause some apprehension, which led to surrender, which led to this beautiful clarity and purity that felt holy and sacred.. From only 4.1g of Mimosa and 2g of Syrian Rue! It was mild yet heavy.. Visuals were light but the mental weight was rather heavy and personally significant. 

&#x200B;

To wrap up the mystery, I've calculated that the amount of Syrian Rue required to activate the alkaloids in Mimosa Hostilis for psychedelic purposes is probably very dangerous to combine with San Pedro. 

&#x200B;

To explain, I normally count 10-20 individual Syrian Rue seeds for 12 inches of San Pedro cactus brew and have a decent ++ trip with realizations, strong hand trails, strong mental activity, mild closed eye visuals, symmetrical textures on walls (fractal-like), some rainbow coloring, and sometimes vivid ancient faces and animal spirits in the trees and the clouds. (((Without an MAOI, I experience nothing but nausea, discomfort, light sensitivity, stimulation and some anxiety when consuming San Pedro on it's own. To me this is pointless.)))

&#x200B;

50 Syrian Rue seeds weigh about 0.2 grams. Yes, 0.2 grams. Not 2g, 0.2g!

So in other words, I need about 20 times as much Syrian Rue for Mimosa activation than I would need for San Pedro Activation, since drinking Mimosa on anything less than a couple grams of Syrian Rue is not worth the hours of preparation and nasty taste. I tried 50 individual seeds (0.2g) and it did not activate my 3.5 grams of thoroughly brewed Mimosa, I only got a mild Rue buzz.

&#x200B;

Combining Mimosa with San Pedro (basically the subject of the post) would mean consuming the 2 grams of Syrian Rue with San Pedro Cactus(Yikes). 2 grams of Syrian Rue with a San Pedro Cactus brew is likely way too much MAO inhibition for Mescaline and probably will cause excess physical discomfort during a very intense and sensitive psychedelic experience. Not desirable.

&#x200B;

Drinking Mimosa in that situation would certainly add more physical discomfort and possibly more intensity to the mental weight of the experience. I think the only way this could work is by probably using 3 to 5 inches of San Pedro maximum, with 1-2 Grams Syrian Rue and perhaps 3 grams of Mimosa Hostilis. Should anyone try this? Hell no. The idea is interesting though.

Psychedelics,ffsnhvp,t3_eur1jp,1580186274.0,"Good post. This combo is intriguing to me. 

&#x200B;

I've once taken about one tab (Mentos with blotter in it) of LSD around 8pm or 9pm, then ate 2.5 grams of good mushrooms about 10 hours later at 6am the next morning.

 It was so delayed that it does not even count as a combo, really.

But let me tell you, those mushrooms were powerful. I had no tolerance to those mushrooms, and had a very good memorable trip from them. I believed the recent LSD dose actually potentiated the mushrooms, rather than causing cross-tolerance.

Personally, I've been very interested in taking a low dose of LSD, like 100 mcg as you said. Then taking 2-3 grams of mushrooms like 4 or 5 hours later. I'm sure you will have a very dynamic, interesting experience with distinctive phases from that sort of ""peak delay.""

kratom,ffedljj,t3_esv3y2,1579844118.0,"Interesting post. 

&#x200B;

I don't know if this will matter to anyone, but I normally dose 0.5g to 1g (grams) twice on my dosing days, usually spread out over my work breaks. 

&#x200B;

This plant is so harmless and helpful, especially when kratom is used frugally and only when it is needed. I stress that kratom is a safe plant and should never be considered a hard drug. It is much safer to me than nicotine, alcohol, and even safer than cannabis in most cases (when it comes to working, driving and operating machinery, it's safer than pot).

&#x200B;

Small amounts of kratom consistently give me wonderful mood lifting benefits and the vigor to push through stressful physical and mental tasks with more ease, as long as it's a decent batch. I also always combine kratom with green tea, 50mg L-Theanine and some watered down coffee with another 50mg L-Theanine in that. When using this combo, and eating healthy and exercising every day, I only experience benefits from kratom. Small doses may work well for me because I'm a stoner type, I am NOT an opiate/hard drug/barbiturate type in any way. 

&#x200B;

The only time I got withdrawal symptoms was after using kratom 7-10 days straight, taking at least 1-2g throughout the day. Sometimes up to 3g. I got the shakes for a little bit, and it kind of freaked me out. From then on, I stay away from anything above 2g per work day, and only use kratom on work days only. I normally work 3-5 days a week. I have experienced no withdrawals since, only benefits. I've had caffeine crashes way worse than this kratom withdrawal experience. ( I avoid adrenal fatigue and caffeine crashes by watering down my black coffee half n half)

&#x200B;

Drinking Kava on my days off helps alot too and probably completely covers any minor withdrawal symptoms I would be experiencing. Cannabis alone would help a lot non-kratom days too.

&#x200B;

I think taking more than 10 grams of Kratom per day for any reason is probably too much, a waste of money, and a recipe for unwanted sickness and undesirable withdrawals. If I need some good pain relief, I can get that from combining the same low dose of kratom with Kava, quality Whole Nutmeg, or Cannabis. Combining all of them in one day zombifies me. hahaha. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR, Kratom is a safe harmless plant, especially when used sparingly and only when needed. 0.5g-1g doses of kratom combined with caffeine and L-Theanine give me all the benefits I need to carry through undesirable tasks with ease, with no withdrawal symptoms ever."

It may be a while until I get it but I'll be sure to post on it! lol I'm also feeling apprehensive about trying a powerful Ayahuasca analogue during this time in my life.

Agreed! I've read similar things like this many times said by experienced users, shamans and Ayahuasceros. It's called Ayahuasca for a reason, people!



I also agree that reducing the confusion around these plants would be greatly helpful for seekers too. Thank goodness there's tons of forums and information on this exact subject out there for those willing to seek the truth on the matter... myself as an example of a rather ignorant yet curious and sincere explorer, I've found the correct information multiple times. I've been reading about Ayahuasca consistently for about 3 year now and understand the feeling of frustration with seeing some people calling something Ayahuasca that is simply not Ayahuasca.

I think your highlights on Ayahuasca here are valuable, and appreciate you using this place to collect these thoughts of yours. Thank you for sharing this with us!

Also, please share your friends experiences whenever you get hold of them! I'm obviously curious about their visions and personal realizations and lessons learned, but more curious of the physical effect it has on their bodies too. Like, how sick or how tense they felt from before and after the combo. I'm also curious about the mental weight they felt from this Aya + San Pedro combo as well ( if they felt like they were going permanently insane, or felt unbearable terror, how alarming the trip was for them)

Regardless, I may end up eventually partaking in this combo at home once I can successfully brew Ayahuasca or one of it's analogues. I'll start pretty small too.

I also make sure to use the nuts with more darker veins in the inside. If it is all tan with very little to no dark brown veins, it's not the good quality nutmeg.

I agree with what you say about the name Ayahuasca being rather carelessly pasted onto Mimosa/Rue brews that have no Ayahuasca Vine in the brew. I see how it can even be interpreted as disrespectful and ignorant.

Please bear with me... I think ""ayahuasca analogue'"" is somewhat appropriate. Other explorers on the interwebs have made up their own names. Anahuasca, pharmahuasca, etc. Truth is, most of said explorers are only searching for a way to experience and explore their consciousness with DMT, whether for wholesome or selfish reasons, and why shouldn't they explore it? For the sake of people searching for their souls, this name would make it easier for them to find these alternatives, for their chance in this short life to explore. It's hard for many people to find a vehicle to explore this psychedelic frontier. It's a rare precious experience that more people are searching for, and some even need to experience. This is where I think ""ayahuasca analogue"" may be fair to use for Mimosa/Rue preparation, in the same way that ""shroom analogue"" can be used for 4-aco-DMT. It's not mushrooms, but 4-aco-DMT may be instrumental to someone searching for their soul, for that someone who may never find mushrooms in their whole life. (imagine how sad that would be.. it's a reality for many) Pailocybin Mushrooms and Ayahuasca are well-known names of powerful botanicals, compared to Jurema and 4-aco-DMT, which are less popular but more easily accessible to many seekers.

I may possibly never brew true Ayahuasca with Caapi and Chacruna correctly at home, or ever meet a shaman, but if one can correctly and safely brew Mimosa with Caapi(not rue) and have a powerful inspiring experience, I think one could call it an ayahuasca analogue without misrepresenting true Ayahuasca. I don't think calling Jurema an ayahuasca analogue is a sin either, considering the mechanisms of both brew's chemistry.
 
I don't expect anyone to agree with me, and totally understand and respect you if you disagree. I just think that name ""ayahuasca analogue"" can help the others find what they need for their chance to explore the infinite in this short life. Just a thought I guess."
Ayahuasca,ff59j35,t1_ff3s0f5,1579584319.0,"Wow! This video you linked of the Caapi preparation, I find it very powerful and touching. The music is beautiful.. and it's more than just music.. it's medicine, heart, tradition, togetherness, and power.. wow. Beautiful. I needed to see that :)

Thank you for the good advice! I understand now that the true Ayahuasca is prepared with the leaves and the caapi vine, and that Mimosa is not a traditional ingredient for the 'true' Ayahuasca brew, but it is rather an analogue. You also reminded me that LOVE is the most important ingredient in Ayahuasca. Now curiosity leads me to look into traditional Jurema preparations and experiences, but preparing the traditional Ayahuasca with Chacruna and/or Chaliponga with Caapi will never be off my list until I do it successfully. The experiences I've read and the art I've seen have me forever curious until I live through it myself.

Ayahuasca,ff57gyu,t1_ff3b9x7,1579582456.0,"That's why I'm conflicted about sharing my experiences with San Pedro and Syrian Rue in detail. It only works when I put 10-30 Syrian Rue seeds into my brew of 12-18inches of San Pedro cactus and I've had some strong ++ level experiences, pushing into +++ slightly. But I don't want someone to try the same thing and hurt themselves just because I was perfectly fine doing this about 17 or 18 times.. Aside from interesting visuals and insights and heightened intuitions, I would always feel a very strong tension in my body, and I'm sure that same tension might be the straw that breaks someone's fragile health if they try this brew without researching it.

I honestly think the variance on how nutmeg effects us humans can be from our differing genetics. Some people report with conviction that they get flu like symptoms every time they take nutmeg, and I swear on my life that nutmeg consistently gets me sky high and gives beautiful warm fluffy cannabis-like feelings and a similar head space to go with it. I felt better on it when I actually HAD the flu! lol And today I only took one gram nutmeg combined with my daily stack and felt a gentle soothing feeling in my head and body throughout my work shift, all day, even now as I type. It only happens when I consume nutmeg though. Why? Who knows.


Also, if you or your crack-using acquaintance were using preground nutmeg, that solves the riddle of you guys having awful nutmeg hangovers.

It must be a true blessing to know workers of these medicines that can brew it for you and guide you through the complex worlds the medicine can take you to.

I think my question of combining these two plants of power comes from my personal longing and coveting of Ayahuasca (I bet she will kick my ass for this when I finally meet her...). I've tried brewing it at least 5 times and failed each time. I did this with gentle singing, prayers and wholesome intentions the best I could. A reliable Ayahuasca recipe is a subject for another thread, and there's already TONS of threads on it. Good ones too. 

To be fair, once on an attempted Aya brew, I briefly floated through a space/ star tunnel with closed eyes, and later saw a perfect circle in black darkness, and the circle led to a place with blue skies and tan desert mountains, and the circle was framed by a series of small benevolent eyes. I wanted to go there but it was too distant. This was with Chacruna (diplopterys cabrerana) and Caapi. I combined Chacruna, Chaliponga and Caapi once and it did nothing but clear my digestive system. I was hoping the Mimosa Hostilis would work better, since I've read tons of experiences using this ingredient with wonderful results.

A hangover that is NOT a hangover(?)

Hard to explain but I'll try. A hangover is commonly known as the nausea, pain, headaches, and general sickness felt from consuming lots of alcohol the night before. I do not get any nausea, pain, headaches, or sickness AT ALL from weed or nutmeg the morning after, so perhaps using the word ""hangover"" was inappropriate. There are some mild, negative side effects I do experience consistently from nutmeg and cannabis on the following morning after use. 

1 - I do not want to get out of bed!
2 - My thinking is slower
3 - My mouth and body will feel dry as hell
4 - Dizziness when first standing up

I guess we can call these ""after effects"" instead of a ""hangover,"" if that term works better for everybody. 

I remember in my daily smoking days, I would immediately wake up and smoke a bowl first thing in the morning with some ice water and feel completely fine. Nowadays, I notice the same thing when I wake up and immediately consume a few grams of nutmeg and some cold water.

nutmeg,ff1wure,t1_ff0uv9z,1579488008.0,"I hear you. How many grams of nutmeg do you normally consume before getting a hangover like that? Do you use preground powder or fresh whole nutmeg nuts? 

Within minutes of having caffeine, a decent meal and hydration, the ""hangover"" for either of these substances subsides for me. I find both to be harmless, wonderful plant medicines. Inspiring and warming.... and dehydrating lol"
Kanna,ff1wdlu,t1_fevg631,1579487685.0,"I'm glad you're okay! I recently ordered some Kanna, so in a few weeks I'll be trying it! The idea of a smokable ""shroom like come-up"" is simply impossible to say no to."

YES, I say Kratom is in fact a stimulant because, 1, I cannot sleep after consuming kratom. Red Sumatra is said to be the most relaxing and pain killing strain, and I could not sleep until it wore off. I was laying awake going through all these social scenarios, goals, memories, just thought after thought. At that time I think I drank a 1 gram tea of that Red Sumatra. Someone close to me who tried kratom for pain relief at night had trouble sleeping too.

2, The outdoor laborers in the SouthEast Asian islands and countries (Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, etc, this is where Kratom and Nutmeg come from!) love Kratom and drink it throughout the day. It relieves them of their tiredness and gives them energy to do intense physical labor all day. They pronounce it kruh-TOM and they chew the leaves, 1-3 leaves per dose for them.

I'm sure some people can sleep on kratom, but I cannot. I'm more of a stoner, never an opiate user (other than kratom) so that might have something to do with it's effect on me.

Kava is more of a downer. I usually drink Kava on days off, and nutmeg breaks."
nutmeg,ff0kwnt,t3_eqrkkg,1579469796.0,"I respectfully disagree with Nutmeg's classification as a Deleriant. 

I've used nutmeg regularly for almost 3 years as a cannabis substitute. I've used whole nuts and tried the nutmeg essential oil recently. It's effects are of the same category as Cannabis. That being: Intoxicant, Stimulant, Mild Psychedelic, and at times, even a Depressant too. From 6-10 grams of grated whole nutmeg, all day i'll feel a state of care-free well-being and peace with the moment, with some fluffy cannabis like euphoria in my head, body and limbs. I'll see mild tracers on moving objects, and see the world around me as beautiful. I get munchies and red eyes from it. It also creatively inspires me. I'll wake up the next day with a weed-like hangover, which is not even a hangover haha. Smaller doses of 1-2 grams work like a nootropic or a microdose for me, gently lifting my mood and state of wellbeing. 


Datura is a deleriant, and is very dangerous. Hit erowid's experience reports on Datura and Brugmansia for some freaky, scary and dangerous 'trips.'"

Drugs,feuejwl,t1_feqyjfc,1579385777.0,"Cool! Just to be clear, Kratom is a cleaner stimulant than nutmeg forsure.. nutmeg alone is rather hashy in terms of effects.

You can also break up 1 half gram of hash as fine as you can, sprinkle it on butter/coconut oil in a baking dish, cover with foil, and bake on 230f degrees  for like 22 minutes. Let that cool down, then put your baking dish with the hash butter/oil in the fridge. I'll take a little ""shard"" of this concoction and eat it, washed back with water. It's about 8-12 doses that will get you stoned like people's crazy edible stories!! Big 3 hour come up for the high. Crazy thought immersion and strong couch locking.

Kanna,fepv6qr,t3_eq8y76,1579332462.0,"I think, to be safe, you should not combine DXM with Kanna. I know that MDMA and Kanna are contraindicated, because of the way they act on Serotonin (I do not know exactly how). And DXM is reported to have a strange effect on Serotonin re-uptake(?) as well. I'm no expert but I would wait at least 24 hours to avoid any potential serious risks to your health."

The way you describe kanna makes me want to try it much more than before. I'm more interested in smoking it, since I've never snorted anything in my life (I mean, other than sniffing dank weed..). If you ever figure out what makes kanna work consistently, pleeeaaase share it with us. I'll do some further investigation, and perhaps some experimentation as well. Do you like to smoke it as a joint or in a pipe or bong?"
Drugs,feptz9j,t1_feoo47x,1579331213.0,"Here is one thread on the essential oil posted by 69ron.

You can easily find more threads on Nutmeg essential oil by simply googling ""nutmeg essential oil forum"" and you'll run into plenty of reading material and experiences.

https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/herbsmxf/nutmeg-oil-a-far-better-psychedelic-than-nutmeg-nu-t3619726.html

But the way 69ron doses his oil in capsules is just weird to me..

Here's an easier way to dose the oil. I get a cookie. Any cookie. Like chips ahoy or something. I measure 1ml (don't over do it!!) by using my measuring spoons. Using the 1/4 teaspoon (one quarter teaspoon), I fill that spoon flat with nutmeg essential oil (using a dropper that comes with the oil) and dump it onto the cookie. The cookie is necessary because the oil soaks into the cookie surface and will not be lost. Goes down easier on chocolate chip cookies too. 

1ml is enough. 2ml was pretty strong and made me giggly while at work.. which is a bit too much! Was reminding me of my mild acid trips. I don't need to be mildly tripping and giggling at nothing while serving the public! lol 


The effect of the essential oil on 1ml is less stoney and more focused and stimulating than regular nutmeg. The stimulating effect literally gets stronger and stronger over a course of 12 hours, like regular nutmeg. I always have my caffeine with this too, and I seem to be more jittery under the effect of nutmeg essential oil. I generally feel happier on it too, and work harder. I stress that it's pretty stimulating.. So, if you plan to get to sleep at 9pm at night, you need to dose this essential oil around 7am that morning. It may still be pretty stimulating past 9pm that night... It can keep you awake past midnight easy. When I need to sleep, I'd pop a Melatonin and just lay as still as I can to get to sleep. 


I'm sorry that all this is so complicated and long lol It's one thing after another! Please be careful and do lots of reading if you even think about trying any of this stuff. I'm willing to go into more detail on any of this if you want."
Drugs,fepsbvv,t1_fenxji1,1579329598.0,"lol phenibuttt, not a significant source of relief for me. Kratom does taste nasty, unless brewed like a tea and sipped like tea. I never have a problem with it's flavor because of that.



I tired using alcohol for relief. Have not had a drink since 2015. I don't like spending 10-30 bucks on something that just makes me feel dumb and sick. Used to be fun but that died quick with regular use. I don't need or want alcohol anymore.


That buzz I get off of nutmeg is undeniably pleasant, and has been since 2017! No point in lying about it. Considering the strong internet stigma against nutmeg, I don't blame you for not wanting to try it. As long as you got your lovely weed and noice noids by your side, you won't need nutmeg anyway. This whole message was for the poor souls out there that could use an alternative to take care of them til the dry storm or legal issues blow over.

Have you tried Kanna? I would love to hear your experiences and how it compares to Kratom.



I would microdose psychedelics and make posts about it but I have no access to psychedelics other than San Pedro and Ayahuasca(which I cannot make correctly yet).



Relating to microdosing psychedelics, Nutmeg contains myristicin and safrole, which both look very similar chemically to MDMA. It contains elemicin too, which looks very similar to mescaline. Personally, I experience mild psychedelic effects from nutmeg, and these chemical structures seem to correlate to the feelings and experiences I have with nutmeg. 


I know this may sound silly, but I often microdose with nutmeg. 1 or 2 grams for me works like how I would expect a nootropic or a psychedelic microdose to work. Subtle mood lift, subtle positive outlook, subtle mental stimulation, subtle inspiration, feelings of life making sense and being okay for me. It's wonderful.."

I understand the 'men just tough it out' paradigm. I can tough things out with kratom and nutmeg lol. We just do what we need to do to survive, and perhaps, hating life (because of stone cold sobriety) is no way for us to survive. 

Those warm soft furry feelings you mentioned.. I literally get that feeling from whole nutmeg. That's what kept me using it for about 3 years now. To me personally, that fuzzy feeling is comparable to pot. Nutmeg actually contains 1 or 2 of the terpenes(not cannabinoids) found in marijuana. One of them is B-Pinene, I think."

Just a warning, I'm going to mention some of the same stuff I just said, but I'm going in more detail about how I use coffee.

&#x200B;

For staying awake, instead of a cup of coffee with cream and sugar, I do half water and half coffee. No cream, no sugar. Now add L-Theanine to this, and you might never have a bad caffeine crash again. Caffeine crashes used to destroy me at work, and this coffee with water trick has been working wonders for me for several months now. If that's not enough to help, throw kratom into the mix.

&#x200B;

I'm sure you know you should get enough sleep too.

&#x200B;

Are we talking about staying awake? I can't get to sleep right now because I dosed about 1ml of nutmeg essential oil today at 8am. It's fucking past 11pm and I'm still stimulated. I think this is relevant. Food for thought..

&#x200B;

Speaking of food, I recently discovered that cutting certain FOODS out of my diet made a massive difference. I love french fries and pasta and junk food, but I gotta kiss all that shit goodbye if I want to feel alert and energetic at work (even while stoned on nutmeg lol). Foods like chicken breast, veggies, fruits and nuts are going to make you feel fucking great if you can commit to keeping your carb intake(and junk food intake) super low. Whether it's vegan sausage or chicken breast, this concentrated protein with veggies combo will likely make you feel much better (if your body chemistry is similar to mine!).

&#x200B;

TL;DR

Water down your coffee and add L-Theanine to it, eat more protein with veggies,  and get enough sleep.

I hope this helps somehow. Good luck with work and school!"
Drugs,fem8zzo,t1_fejbl8t,1579244186.0,"Hey, nonpalo. Have you ever had a salvia-like trip from nutmeg? I've tried both and personally feel like they are opposites. Salvia experience to me is short, uncomfortable, scary, and feels like reality and my body is getting ripped and torn.

Nutmeg, when dosed 1st thing in the morning, for me  it lasts all day past when I go to sleep, feels cozy and warm, feels familiar and pleasant, makes reality feel like it's coming together and makings sense.

Worst feeling from nutmeg I could get is taking 15 grams or more, eating junk food like doritos, and forgetting to drink water. That combo right there is like sahara-mouth hash-land with stomach cramps.
