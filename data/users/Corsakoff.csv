The punishment for a crime is not there as satisfaction for the victim, but as a deterrent for the would-be criminal. You are supposed to punch no one and no one ""had it coming"". 

Look at your convictions and then ask yourself why people prefer even Trump to what you're proposing! He's offering a nothing-burger, but you're offering a shit-cake with the suggestion that people don't have to eat it, if they really don't want to."

FragileWhiteRedditor,ff6i3yf,t1_ff6fkw2,1579627685.0,"I told you that Free Speech good, punching bad, what goes around comes around and concentrating on a minority with politically extreme views doesn't change anything. Gotta work with those, who disagree on some things and get them on board for your most important goals. That's a hell of an argument!

FragileWhiteRedditor,ff654wr,t1_ff62v5o,1579619366.0,"The last point you made is important. You won the last round of federal elections and you will win more, if you push for Sanders, instead of Elizabeth Warren, because there will still be Democrats who won't vote Neo-Liberal no matter what. Winning elections and pushing progressive legislation is key, punching people will not be a deciding factor. 
You asked, why I would support them spreading racism. Because Freedom of Speech isn't convenient, yet important. If you change the laws, so that ""hate speech"" can be prosecuted and hate speakers punched with impunity, you will find yourself in a hell you created yourself. 
Trump declared Qassem Soleimani a terrorist, so that they would have a legal basis to assassinate him. Now Iran declared all American military personnel terrorists, a fact that will have relevance once they inevitably get hold of their first American POW's.
Tricks of that sort seem incredibly intelligent in the short term. When you give someone the tool to declare certain views hate speech, they might declare your views hate speech. I believe you Americans describe that with the saying, that eventually the chickens come home to roost."
FragileWhiteRedditor,ff61ejg,t1_ff5u4gm,1579616661.0,"There are more people who are now vocal about their racism, but there are way more people who are now vocal about their view that racists suck. Racism is not a winning strategy and you should team up with allies where you find them, like the people who also don't like racists, but are worried about an uncontrolled influx of illegal immigrants, which should also worry people on the left, because it's actually a Neo-Liberal switcheroo to bring down wages and weaken unions in the homeland. This creates resentment among workers, that didn't exist before and that is what you should be focussing on. Don't look to the guy with a swastika tattoo on his forehead, the real danger is a currently tolerant, white working class that more and more loses the support of people on the left and then runs into the arms of whichever snake oil salesman promises them a better future. You folks are promising them literally nothing, you don't even talk to them... and then wonder, why you lose elections!"

The US government only carries out genocide outside its borders and it never happens because of race, but because of resources. Americans advocating for turning America into a Nazi regime have existed forever, but the result was that the country abolished slavery, because a human-trafficking dictatorship doesn't have public support in your country. And you still can't preemptively kill people for God's sake, UNLESS YOU AGREE WITH TRUMP!"
