And if the plaintiff can prove that they have called the police on other black customers and/or *not* on customers of other races (which is obviously more difficult since he doesn't have the bank records) that significantly helps his case.

There are two ways to prove discrimination (beyond reasonable doubt) - direct and indirect proof. Direct would be if the bank said ""we are calling the police because you are black"". That obviously doesn't happen often. The *majority* of cases are indirect 

In the indirect method, the plaintiff has to prove that the bank knew that he is a member of a protected class (which they obviously did) and that they acted with disparate treatment.

The bank has given their reasons for the decision. The person suing only has to prove that the reason is a pretext. If he can show evidence that calls the bank's stated reason into question (such as that other such cases occurred and the bank simply put a hold on the money and did not call the police, or that the bank policy is to put a hold on the money), then that is reasonable evidence to conclude that the bank engaged in disparate treatment and that the stated reason is a pretext for discrimination

Does that mean there are 4 categories of cookies: chewy, soft, crunchy, and crispy?

Or can a cookie be both chewy and soft, or even both soft and crispy? (soft on the inside, crispy on the outside?) Or crunchy and chewy?"

Basically the conversation usually goes something this

""The reason universal healthcare wouldn't work in the US is because of our racial diversity""

""Why would racial diversity affect the ability to implement universal healthcare?""

""Well because the differences in language and culture make a universal healthcare system more difficult""

""Well Canada and Switzerland have more racial diversity than the US and both have universal healthcare (source)""

""But they defined race wrong! Switzerland is mostly white""

""They defined race as a distinct language and culture, which is what you said makes universal healthcare more difficult. So if it's not language and culture that's the problem, because Switzerland is able to do it and they're white, then you're saying that it's the difference in *skin color* that's the problem.

Because the American government spends $38 billion each year to subsidize the meat and dairy industries, but only 0.04 percent of that (i.e., $17 million) each year to subsidize fruits and vegetables.


Also, for restaurants specifically, food cost is only about 25 of the total operating costs

So even if vegetables were *free*, you'd only get at most a 25% reduction in price of a meal at a *restaurant* that was purely veg"

It's not technically wrong. If I heard someone explain, say ""I'm storing the value as binary"", I'd assume they're talking about boolean, but it's an awkward way to say it because 1) *everything* is stored in binary. And 2) binary can also refer to *a ton* of other things in programming (""non-binary"", not so much)

Given how much of a stretch it is to think of a scenario where referring to binary and non-binary in this context makes sense, I think this is definitely bait. Otherwise the poster would have given more context"
