depression,ffh0z54,t3_etkvgj,1579920195.0,"That's tough... were you guys just teasing each other, or was your friend aware that they were hurting your feelings? If so, I would not want to continue being around such a person."
depression,ffh0mcm,t3_et6dc3,1579919921.0,"Me too, I regularly refer to myself as a lazy piece of shit and I tend to be very unproductive/have very poor time management skills."
depression,ffh0iju,t3_et934t,1579919841.0,That's awesome! Which flavor did you have?
depression,ffh0ftn,t3_etk40u,1579919784.0,"Not that I have any experience with dating at all, but... maybe you should be direct and ask him why he doesn't want to talk anymore? Just to get some closure."
depression,ffh04sl,t3_etep5d,1579919553.0,I love sleeping a lot too... I wish I could just sleep through some days uninterrupted honestly.
depression,ffgzyjz,t3_etgu0i,1579919424.0,"I wish I had a cat... my parents would not let me keep one while I was at home because they didn't want fur around the house, and I'm not allowed to have one in my dorm either."
depression,ffcuoui,t3_eswd3w,1579807630.0,"I totally feel you, I'm an introvert too. I think, though, the truth is 'normal' people don't have these magical traits that causes everyone to reach out to them and care about them. It's a mutual thing, they also have to reach out to and care about others, and that's what I think I'm struggling with."

depression,ffbbf3h,t3_esiopv,1579758467.0,same! I'm in college and I feel like I'm always one step behind my classmates.
depression,ffajf14,t3_esedcq,1579737213.0,It's probably a little kid or a teenager who thought it would be a funny joke and weren't aware of the hurt they were causing you. I'm so sorry.
depression,ffaizz7,t3_esh66s,1579736900.0,me too
depression,ff4gk9o,t3_eriz5y,1579563089.0,There are people out there who don't judge people solely by their height. Hang in there.
depression,ff4gc5g,t3_erb1dj,1579562935.0,That looks so interesting! I wish I had your skills.
depression,ff4g73u,t3_erllm6,1579562840.0,"I can relate, sometimes I feel desperate to get away from my depression and try and search for anything that will help to distract me from it. In these situations, though, I find it can be helpful for me to take a step back, take a deep breath, and meditate a little. Sometimes if you acknowledge it rather than trying to drown it out, it becomes a tad more bearable."
depression,ff4f8v8,t3_ereieo,1579562195.0,Congratulations! Keep up the hard work. You can do this.

depression,fepag4t,t3_eq1xd4,1579315773.0,"I used to feel this way as well. What helped was making an effort to talk to people a bit more, whether irl or online, and realizing that I had a story of my own to tell too."
depression,fep8yep,t3_eq0um9,1579314801.0,"I can relate. Sometimes I feel like I wasted all of my potential and that I'm worthless for not having tried harder, and that I just give up way too easily. I still have hope that I'll be more committed to my field of study one day, though. Hang in there bro."
