AskNYC,ffr2hj1,t1_ffp4d9v,1580149020.0,"Its amazing how when our space is compromised, our needs become less. Sometimes I think the more space and options we have, the more unsatisfied we become. You were able to be okay just from just having that door and 30 minutes to yourself. Thats pretty amazing."

yoga,ffr1ylx,t1_ffprlbw,1580148688.0,"I had a lot of health problems happen Oct 2018. I noticed this last October I started feeling pretty bad. I had some symptoms come back, and then leave. I do believe the body remembers. What helped me was walking mediation, where you just walk slowly and mindfully, focusing on the breathing, or what ever helps you breath better. Maybe music or watching Planet Earth (if indoors on a treadmill). Its best if done outside in nature, though the cold can be rather uncomfortable. I took that same approach back to the yoga mat. Just doing very slow mindful poses, pausing in between each to acknowledge the transition. Eventually I became a little more brave and started walking uphill and faster. In my yoga practice, I started getting a little more active with Sun Salutations and Surya Namaskar. Everyday is different and some days I dont get on the mat at all. I just take it one day at a time though and try to remember that Spring will come again."

selfimprovement,ffqzoj6,t3_euhybf,1580147247.0,"I think it might be good to exam how we look at age and time. Its all made up. You are as young as you feel. When I was in high school, I felt like an old person. I was slow, depressed, and just not at all excited about life. I remember seeing my parents have all this energy and I would wonder, how? Well it was because they were doing their life. They were doing what they wanted. If possible, find something you want to do or work on or try many different things. If you dont have the energy and motivation you can accept that and be more meditative to see if that helps bring about a different energy. I do believe that we tend to absorb the energy of the people we are around. Cutting out negative people is a really good idea. Watch who you talk to, how to speak, what you say, it all effects how you feel about life in the day to day."
yoga,ffntjzs,t1_ffnsab4,1580070619.0,"That make me feel better too. :) By chance, are you or your ancestors from a warmer climate? Mine are from Portugal. I cant help but think this has something to do with the discomfort I feel."

adhd_anxiety,ffh37cx,t3_et67yl,1579921877.0,"I can relate a lot with what you are saying. I had a very very hard time focusing in high school, especially the last year. I almost didn't graduate. When I went to college, I still struggled. It was so difficult to stay motivated, even though I was interested in the topics I was studying. It was very frustrating. In my last year of school I went to a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with ADD. I started adderall and was finally able to focus on my studies and appreciate my what I was interested in. My grades improved and I became excited about my future. Many might say that this is just the medication helping me feel this way, and that may be true to some extent, but it did give me that lift I needed to gain momentum in my life. Looking back it would have been beneficial if I was in some kind of therapy as well. I ended up relying on the medication 100% creating a psychological dependence. Being off the medication now, I can see how much is was able to help me maintain my focus, but I can also see how I could have really benefited from therapy during that time. 

At your college, is there a health center you could go to for medication and therapists? If I could go back. I would have gotten a good therapist and gotten on add medication in high school. It would have really helped me make better decisions down the line."

adhd_anxiety,ffcn10e,t3_esp1vr,1579802921.0,"I know this feeling, and it can feel like you are drowning and panicking at the same time. For me, I know its because i am believing my thoughts to be true. So I try to practice this:

When these thoughts come up, try to remember that they are just thoughts, and they are temporary. You do not need to personally identify with them, meaning you dont need to have any sense of self tied to them. They are separate from you. Dont resist them, let them come up. But remain unattached.  Notice how you feel, and try to do what seems right in that moment to ease your anxiety."

spirituality,ff6msot,t1_ff63t5d,1579630538.0,"Me as well, a couple years ago I started getting this lump in my throat that would not go away. Its is better now, but still comes up here and there."

therapy,fezv1vi,t1_fes1kvm,1579462027.0,"I can relate so much to this. It seems I get everything done better, faster, and more efficiently if I have very little time to do it in. I dont have any drugs or alcohol to keep me going though, just adrenaline. At the end of the day though, I know this cant be good for my overall health."
therapy,fezq1au,t1_fenxphx,1579460216.0,True for both I believe. I hear that intermittent fasting is good for mental clarity. So I am looking into that.
therapy,fezprl1,t1_fepnki8,1579460129.0,"This seems like a really good tactic. 5 things might be too much for me, maybe I would start with 3. I have noticed that I like doing one activity at a time and really devoting all my efforts to that activity. Its just hard to get other things done. So it usually creates an imbalance in my life."
therapy,fezpdhq,t1_feq3oxy,1579459988.0,I just hope that I can sit still enough to talk....The problem I had last time was that I was just so anxious during the therapy that i just kept rambling and not getting anywhere....

therapy,fezo7fz,t1_feufen9,1579459586.0,"You just described me. Walking on a steep incline is one of the only things that makes me feel better. And I can do it for a loooong time. I tried running, but I would become too fatigued, and could not eat enough to keep it up. The walking uphill was a good compromise. Have you had luck with any medications?"

therapy,fepjfaw,t1_fep1eaa,1579322050.0,I stopped meditating and I have fallen apart. So I’m going to start again. One thing I really liked about meditating was that I could finally know how I was doing. Usually I would realize I was okay and actually happy and grateful and hungry. Then I would eat enough finally and rest.

benzorecovery,fdkuf3u,t3_eluj3e,1578511371.0,You have a very sturdy brain. It would be abnormal if you were not feeling the w/d symptoms. Your brain and body are doing the right thing which happens to be really painful. Right now is the worst of it because the body is now completely without the drug. It will get better with time.
