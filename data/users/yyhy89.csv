MadeMeSmile,ffbv85f,t3_eshh2q,1579783893.0,"Yea, I’m cynical. Tattoo artists are notorious for being drug addicted and opportunistic with the girls they pierce and tattoo. 

Maybe it’s genuine, though (it isn’t). 

5 seconds into your post history suggests I’m not wrong."

MLBTheShow,felzump,t1_fe5sc2q,1579235297.0,"I agree. This sub is presumably for the players, not the game and the company making it. This is like the difference between MLB and the player’s association. 

This game has had major gameplay issues for years now. The players/customers/users here want to know what the gameplay is like. Of course it should be discussed here. What’s the advantage of following SDS guidelines as it relates to this subreddit?"

Red light; ran right through it. ‘You don’t even have your permit. What the fuck are you doing?’ Maybe if you shut the fuck up, we’d be cruising, and you wouldn’t be sitting boohooing ‘bout your bruises, but no, you wanna be Ms. Fuck-with-the-music. I’m zoning off Relapse. She’s sliding on Blueprint. Three seconds it takes for her to turn blue. With my hands around her throat, her arms stop moving. Pulse stops too. In the back they look confused as I turn to tell ‘em both not to do shit stupid. Red, white, blue lights in the rear view. Shit. Swerved to the shoulder. Tell them both, ‘No moving. Sit down in the back ‘cause the window’s tinted.’ As I roll down mine to forge a new friendship. ‘Aren’t you a little young to be driving?’ ‘Look officer, I’m just trying to get home.’ ‘Get out the fucking car with your license and registration.’ ‘I ain’t getting outta shit, and you’re starting to try my patience.’ Didn’t have backup, I could tell by the humming bike. Reached to the glove to grab the muhfucking hunting knife. Stabbed in his neck and hip. Threw him in the trunk and dipped back to the crib for some tea and crumpets, shiiit."
