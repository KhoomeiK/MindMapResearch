COMPLETEANARCHY,fcov0de,t1_fcop8z4,1577842315.0,I agree wholeheartedly.

IWantOut,fcn2n7p,t1_fcmsiyf,1577801549.0,"In all fairness, the Dutch conservatives are not worse than the American ones. I'm not sure if you were being hyperbolic there as you are otherwise very correct in your assessment, but the American Christian Right is actively trying to remove women from the workplace and they currently hold the Vice Presidency."
worldnews,fcn25pi,t1_fcn1qeq,1577801139.0,Ok so what do you do?
TheMajorityReport,fcn1z8x,t3_ehxvpp,1577800985.0,Obviously this has nothing to do with the fact that Weinstein is funded by Peter Thiel.
COMPLETEANARCHY,fcn14uo,t1_fcmvdi0,1577800240.0,Circumstances do matter. But some of the poorest people are the happiest. The most depressed are those who have been well off and lost it.
Anarchism,fcmu41t,t1_fclzhxy,1577792351.0,"Respectfully, that is a piss poor excuse. Waiting to be in ""better shape"" to start training is like keeping kids out of school until they're ""smart enough."" And on a personal level, I cannot tell you how much I've worked on my anxiety and PTSD via self defense classes. There's really nothing like it.

You do you, and I'm sorry to pressure you even slightly, but this particular comment looks like Swiss cheese! I love you."
Anarchism,fcmtvln,t1_fcmf9qe,1577792025.0,I just assume they're all Chinese bots
blender,fcmttno,t3_ehlphn,1577791949.0,Oh god that made me sick. Great job lol
IWantOut,fcmtqc9,t1_fcmntat,1577791819.0,"There is a distinct lack of understanding in this comment. Just think about the word ""relatively"" for a second longer. If OP's monthly salary totals less than $350, for example, *relatively* that course is insanely expensive. Let alone considerations for travel, housing, visa. I'm sure you mean well but this is shortsighted."
IWantOut,fcmtjew,t1_fcmj0xx,1577791554.0,"Glad you clarified, damn. You really did a number there."
COMPLETEANARCHY,fcmtc1o,t1_fcmrhwx,1577791269.0,"That's terrible advice. Don't think about penguins or white elephants either.

The truth is this: Some knowledge requires action from ethical people."
COMPLETEANARCHY,fcmt6dw,t1_fcluyh9,1577791050.0,Taking threats seriously is different from hopelessness. Have faith.
COMPLETEANARCHY,fcmt46s,t1_fclw6qp,1577790963.0,"I had the sudden realization today that we stand in solidarity with not just other leftists but the entirety of the world outside fascism. Fascism as a movement makes all those outside of it leftists by default, in practice. Keep eyes on target. We (the left) will win because we (humanity) cannot afford to lose."
COMPLETEANARCHY,fcmsxli,t1_fcm8qv2,1577790705.0,"I vacillate between this mindset and worrying that Crane Brinton was right. On the one hand, we do what we must to survive, a la For Whom The Bell Tolls, but on the other we must fight for meaningful change or it's not a worthwhile battle. I wish you peace and I will stand with you against fascism."
COMPLETEANARCHY,fcmstae,t1_fcmra6g,1577790538.0,"People will be mad at this comment, but it is ultimately true. No matter how dark the night, depression and anxiety are caused by our perspective, not our circumstances. This is why faith/hope/confidence/whateveryouwanttocallit is vital today. We must not give up the ghost."
COMPLETEANARCHY,fcmsmim,t1_fclv7ch,1577790268.0,"When you're backed into a corner, the only way out is to fight. Be steeled by the fact that, quite literally, we are all going through this together. We are suffering, but we are not alone. Take heart at the global uprising. Know that your struggle is worthy and valuable. Think of the future generations of humans who will thank and praise you for your actions against the Fascists in 2020."
FakeProgressives,fcmsabn,t1_fcms2vn,1577789782.0,"I understand where you're coming from. Those with morals and an interest in ethical action want to remain objective and unbiased. It is an objective and unbiased view that the GOP is a criminal syndicate, not to mention one of the world's most dangerous organizations."
FakeProgressives,fcms6gj,t3_ei069i,1577789627.0,"I'm glad to see call-outs across the board on this sub. Yang gets a lot of undue credit online. His ""I support the spirit of M4A"" nonsense is the definition of Fake Progressive.

Bernie or bust, folks."
FakeProgressives,fcmrkki,t1_fcmia84,1577788749.0,"Both. Also, who's surprised? Show me the policy gap between Biden and the gop."
FakeProgressives,fcmre39,t1_fcmqajs,1577788484.0,"5 or 10 years ago I'd have agreed with you. But the fact is that the Republican party has unfettered itself of any sane position, fully committing to racism and apologetics for the uber rich. To continue to call oneself a Republican in the face of concentration camps and science denial is effectively admitting membership in a criminal organization."
tifu,fcmqx5e,t1_fcmq9c3,1577787805.0,Wholesome!

fightporn,fcmdi1a,t1_fcl381y,1577771389.0,"Actually, it's worse than that. Before they were state-sponsored they were openly mercenaries, working to protect the property of the rich. They still do the same thing, just under the guise of being ""public servants."""
COMPLETEANARCHY,fcl8v7m,t1_fck6aec,1577742328.0,Thanks! You too! :)
geopolitics,fck3f2o,t1_fcjmm9q,1577715419.0,"Well, going by the currently perceived aim of Russia, the goal is probably to create instability in neighboring states so as facilitate future influencing efforts (seen in Dugin but also contemporarily in Surkov). Neostalinism is on the rise in Russia and other former USSR states. Stalinism never truly died out there, in a similar way that Nazism never truly died out in the west. Revisionism is a vital part of this resurgence, naturally.

As for your second question, I believe it is generally accepted that any wedge between European nations benefits Russia as an ""outsider""."
geopolitics,fcja0n6,t1_fcj7kee,1577681006.0,Just general revionism with a hint of neostalinism.
PoliticalHumor,fciv0yq,t1_fcidtpa,1577670480.0,"But if we arrested all of these people today, the system would automatically generate replacements for them tomorrow."

PoliticalHumor,fcgmamd,t1_fcgh2z1,1577641688.0,"It may seem like ""someone"" is to blame, but these problems are largely systemic. We get nowhere by blaming individuals, real or imagined."

dsa,fc4hivv,t1_fc2vs97,1577416825.0,"Who's talking about evil? These people have the right to exist. They're not demons or warlocks. Even Bernie Sanders is a millionaire. That doesn't make him evil, you goofball.

Now that we're beyond the hyperbole, can we discuss our civil disagreement with the manner in which these humans are using their power to prop up a disingenuous liberal politician and thus very likely bring about gruesome austerity measures?"
FakeProgressives,fc4e6wo,t3_efwhki,1577414084.0,Buttigieg is by far the most disingenuous snake in today's grass. Read his book. Seriously.

It must be exhausting being so much smarter than all of us. I wish you the best of luck.
