admincraft,ffxwf3r,t3_evcjey,1580333752.0,"These answers are considering Minecraft as the game, and not as an engine on which to build a completely different game (like WynnCraft).

A:3  
Crafting is a core mechanic of the game, but it is very simple and I think there are some ways it can be made more involved. Drops should typically have some unique quality that is unavailable or difficult to give to crafted items.

B:5  
I am against any land claim system. Land claims are invisible walls. I think a better system would be to make blocks more difficult to break in protected areas. Players should instead use clever building techniques to protect valuables. If you expect interaction between player-states, land claims only eliminate that danger.

C:3  
Server shops should be limited, incentive should be given to collect most resources. However players will only benefit from some system to let them easily sell things to other players.

D:2  
The game can be balanced around a physical currency. A physical currency presents an additional danger to the player, but having currency as a stat actually eliminates part of the (only) danger in the vanilla game."

Your employees aren't simply getting paid for their labor, their labor is a necessary component for your business to even exist. Further, working for your company presents risks to your employees. Now that you've moved your profits into off-shore accounts and removed them from the economy completely, your employees are now at greater risk than you, on top of their hours being more valuable than yours given the amount of work their hours represent."
