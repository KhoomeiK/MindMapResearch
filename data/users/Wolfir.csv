Buttigieg really is quite perfect on the surface. But when you look at his corporate donors, you know he won’t change the country. Just like Obama, people might get excited because it’s something new after 44 straight white men. But Obama didn’t do enough in 8 years of presidency, and Buttigieg won’t get enough done since he’s being bribed by these corporations and billionaires. 

Still, I’m not Bernie-or-Bust. I will vote for the democratic candidate regardless of who it is. But I believe that it’s f Bernie loses in 2020, then we have little change electing a “true progressive” in 2024. I think the progressive movement will die out, and we’ll all be screwed. We’ll hopefully elect democrats for the next twenty years until the boomers die and the republican party reforms itself to stop being evil.

WayOfTheBern,ffghkhh,t1_ffgdfwg,1579906393.0,"I think the problem is that the democratic establishment would absolutely rather have four more years of Trump if the alternative is Bernie Sanders. Bernie is threatening the way of life for career politicians. If Bernie wins, it proves that we can get big money out of politics. Which means people are going to start paying attention to how many billionaire donors each candidate has.

For the democratic establishment, it is ideal that Bernie loses and people just forget about him. That way, the idea of having a candidate that runs for president using only small donors from the individual people . . . well that idea will die, and politicians of both parties can continue to accept bribes from billionaires. The democratic establishment wants people to think that Bernie Sanders was a weird radical who got popular in 2016 and 2020, but he was just a fad that is better off forgotten. His ideas for radically changing the country were nothing more than idealist pipe dreams that he used to try and get elected.

I was shopping for my first shotgun a few months ago. My primary interest was all-around hunting, and my secondary interest was clays.

I wanted an O/U because they seemed so classy and so beautiful, and it just seemed cool to have an over-under. And I loved the simplicity of a break-action gun.

I started shopping around for a ""budget"" O/U. My initial budget was $500. But then I read that the Stoeger guns are not good enough to withstand long-term use.

So I expanded my budget up to $600 or $675 . . . and I started finding some used Franchi O/U guns that were about this price because they were scratched up. I didn't initially plan on spending this much on my first firearm, but I figured that spending over $600 would be worth it if I got an O/U from a reputable company. 

But I didn't pull the trigger on the used Franchi O/U because I realized that it was fixed chokes instead of choke tubes, and because it was a little ambiguous as to whether the barrels could fire steel shot. And also because the gun could only handle 2.75"" shells, so no magnum shells. That's sort-of how I realized an O/U wasn't for me at this point. I wanted my first gun to be a shotgun because I love the versatility of being able to basically hunt anything and everything. But the 2.75"" chamber meant that waterfowl hunting might not be in my future.

I think it depends a lot on what you are ramping into. I think there are quite a few four-mana green sorceries that put two lands onto the battlefield.

So let’s say that you’re on turn 4. You cast the Circuitous Route or whatever it’s called, and you put two lands onto the battlefield. Assuming you hit your land drop the next turn, you now have seven mana on turn 5. I have two problems with that scenario . . . the first problem is that you aren’t guaranteed to naturally hit your fifth land drop unless you have a high land count or some good early card draw. So that’s why I like Cultivate and Kodama’s Reach . . . because putting two lands directly onto the battlefield is only better if you’re going to hit your next land drop anyway. So you may as well cast Cultivate, put one land directly onto the battlefield, and then be guaranteed your next land drop. I consider that to be just as good as those Ranger’s Path cards that cost four mana . . . except Cultivate costs 3 mana, so you can play your ramp earlier. The second problem I have . . . is that I can’t imagine spending turn 4 on ramping when other players are spending four mana on cards that will win the game outright if they aren’t dealt with, such as planeswalkers or other card advantage engines. 

—-

Anyway, I haven’t loved any deck as much as my Varolz deck because . . . I like efficient ramp, and no ramp spell (except for sol ring and mana crypt) is as efficient as the one-mana mana-dork. And as a golgari player, I get to play like nine or ten of these one-mana mana-dorks . . . and they aren’t even dead draws in the late game because of the various synergies within the deck. Obviously drawing a mana dork in the late game is a weak draw, but it isn’t completely dead like it might be in some other decks.

I mentioned being able to cast a seven-drop on turn 5 earlier in my comment . . . sure that’s good, but it isn’t nearly as good as casting a 3-drop on turn 2 . . . or casting a 5-drop on turn 3. I guess that’s why I value efficiency in my ramp spells. Like I’m sure a lot of people have had enormous success with expensive non-symmetrical mana/doublers like Mirari’s Wake. But my problem is that if you drop Mirari’s Wake on when you have five mana, you have access to up to 12 mana the next turn . . . but you need to have a play that actually takes advantage of that mana. Best case scenario is that you can cast something like the OG Kozilek and you already have lightning greaves on the table so you can immediately annihilate someone. But for every one game where you pull off the Mirari’s Wake into Kozilek + Lightning Greaves combo, there are going to be four other games where Kozilek rots in your hand because you couldn’t ramp all the way up to 12.

—-

Anyway, I tend to value midrange threats that can be devastating when they’re cast early and still quite decent when they’re cast on curve. Generally, my last game consists more of flex-cost cards and mana-sinks that let me do something when I have tons of mana. I’m always going to be vulnerable to decks that have a better late game if I fail to punish those decks in the early game . . . but that’s more fun to me than playing a late-game deck that gets punished in the early game because I was durdling around."

2ALiberals,fekesii,t1_fek8vxd,1579198539.0,"People who are anti-gun basically agree that it would be impossible to just ban all guns overnight because then all the gun owners would complain and start shooting people.

So it the best way to ban all the guns is to just slowly make certain things illegal, one at a time. So ""aesthetic modifications"" like handrails or telescopic stocks being partially illegal is a step in the right direction, as far as the anti-gun people are concerned. A lot of anti-gun people also think that law-abiding gun-owners who own long guns are basically the same as violent mass-shooters. So if a non-violent law-abiding gun-owner gets put in prison with a felony charge because he didn't realize it was illegal to put a vertical foregrip, then that's a victory for the anti-gun people . . . because anti-gun people see long-gun-owners as school shooters that just haven't scheduled their school-shooting yet."
EDH,fekd1db,t3_epe47f,1579197493.0,"Eh, I really like fine-tuning a deck. I’ll definitely start building a deck and then realize that some things aren’t working out.

I’m honestly a bit spoiled and a bit of a one-trick pony when it comes to EDH. My only deck is a creature-based Varolz sacrifice deck. I play a low land count to avoid flooding, and I get away with it because I have a lot of cards like Sylvan Ranger and Satyr Wayfinder that will find lands, as well as Springbloom Druid and Wood Elves and Farhaven Elf to ramp me out into the big threats. 

So I don’t have to worry about being color-screwed either. Green provides ramp and fixing. Honestly, it shocks me that people are willing to play 3-color decks and get significantly screwed in terms of colors or land drops in like 15% of all their games. That’s ridiculous"

Modern is basically half-dead at this point. I feel like Modern Horizons was supposed to breathe new life into the format . . . but instead, Modern Horizons just helped to kill the format. The entire format got shaken up to the point where a lot of modern players decided to focus on other formats. And then the Mox Opal ban meant that Affinity players basically decided to abandon Modern, too. In the glory days of Modern, a ban meant that players would switch to a different deck. But nowadays, a ban in Modern just tells the players to switch to a different format. No one is interested in exploring the post-ban format and figuring out what the best deck might be when there is so little benefit to being the best Modern player in your area."

I think the reason there are so few articles and stuff is because the Mossberg and Remington are the pump guns that everyone has.

I own a Benelli Supernova for hunting purposes. It’s a great gun for sure, but some people wonder why I spent a bit more on a pump when Mossberg sells a cheap pump with a good reliable track record and a ton of aftermarket support.

So if you’re looking for a pump gun for home defense, most people tell you to get a Mossberg 500/590/590A1 or they tell you to get a Remington. And then some people chime in and say that all the new remingtons are shittyz

Once you start asking about semi-autos for self-defense, then it gets to the point where everyone is asking about whether they should get a tactical Benelli M1/M2 or whether they should get the Benelli M4 or whether they should get a Beretta 1301 or whether they should get a tactical Rem V3

I think actually don’t think I’d ever buy a semi-auto shotgun as a dedicated home defense gun. I think a pump is the way to go when it comes to self-defense. The thing is that if you’re using a pump for self-defense, I don’t think you need anything fancy. I think you can find a lot of used guns for $200 apiece that will do the job just fine."

Shotguns,feekxtp,t3_eoi25i,1579035847.0,"I used to think what you think. I was basically like “the chances that a meth-crazed home-intruder who is armed and trying to kill my family . . . well that just doesn’t happen, so I may as well load the gun with non-lethal rounds because I don’t want to kill anyone”

I thought my logic was sound.

The problem is that I came to understand the law a bit better. Basically, you really can’t fire your gun at an intruder except in some pretty narrow circumstances.

Like imagine if an unarmed guy wearing a ski mask breaks into your house. You grab your sexy Benelli M4 and point it at him and scream at him to stop. He raises his hands, tells you not to shoot, but he won’t get on his knees. You yell for him to get on his knees and you yell that you’re calling the police. He still doesn’t get on his knees, but his hands are still raised, he’s backing away and saying “I’m just going to go, man. I’m going to go.” He tries to back out the door and run, so you shoot him with your beanbag round, which breaks his rib and incapacitates him. The police arrive and arrest him.

The thing is that you weren’t supposed to fire your gun at him because he wasn’t threatening you. The police or the local prosecutor won’t come after you with criminal charges of any kind, but this guy is going to sue you in civil court for tons of money. The fact that you used a beanbag round here doesn’t help your defense at all. The shotgun is a weapon capable of killing a man, and the fact that you used a shotgun against this intruder who wasn’t threatening you with violence . . . well that doesn’t look good for you. I’m not saying this burglar will be successful in his lawsuit against you, but it’ll be expensive to fight this guy’s lawsuit.

Okay, so now we have a second scenario. We have a meth-crazed armed burglar who breaks into your home, and he’s got a handgun. You point the gun at him, yell at him, but he still advances and raises his gun at you. You fire the beanbag round at him, which basically knocks the wind out of him, but he still manages to raise his gun and shoot. 

In this scenario, you were justified in actually firing the weapon. But the non-lethal ammo didn’t do the trick. Again, I don’t think this scenario is very likely. There aren’t any methheads who I’ve ever seen in my area, and most burglars aren’t looking for a firefight over whatever petty cash and jewelry that a person might keep in their suburban house. 

So my point is this . . . any situation where you’d want non-lethal ammo is a situation where you shouldn’t actually fire your gun. So there is no point in having non-lethal ammo. 

—-

That being said, if you still want beanbag rounds, I don’t blame you. Like I said, I don’t envision actually needing to defend myself against an armed psychotic weirdo, so sometimes I figure that if I need to threaten an intruder, like maybe a drunken asshole with a pocket knife, it might be prudent to have the gun loaded with *something* but not necessarily loaded with buckshot because I don’t want anyone to die in case the gun does go off. But in those scenarios, I’d probably just loaded the #6 shot I use for small game. At close ranges, it might kill the guy anyway."
