CryptoMarkets,ff9mfct,t1_ff90azd,1579716055.0,And then when it goes up in 2021 everyone they’ll  be like I told you! Meanwhile they commented this every year...
gadgets,ff9m5m1,t1_ff9lbv3,1579715896.0,Interesting
orthotropics,ff9laq9,t1_ff9e2zg,1579715392.0,So what? Little improvement > no improvement. Just wanted to know if it’s more than a „placebo“ effect
orthotropics,ff9dua2,t1_ff9dngf,1579710855.0,My jawline is already not bad but why not improve?
orthotropics,ff984on,t1_ff97qm3,1579707049.0,Nice. Thank you. That does look better!
youseeingthisshit,ff78sik,t1_ff78moj,1579643377.0,Yup. So the only option left was selfies which of course aren’t good for tinder ..
gatesopencomeonin,ff77h6a,t1_feg4tz8,1579642630.0,That’s too bad but they definitely get some people just because of that edge between them and their competition. My friend took the lower paying job just to have his buddy there all day which is nice
youseeingthisshit,ff76hwq,t1_ff6kce1,1579642079.0,Same man. I was like yeah let’s put the best looking pictures of me in... oh... I don’t have any at all
youseeingthisshit,ff76fgz,t1_ff6fw9j,1579642041.0,Seriously tho. That’s why I don’t have pictures of myself ...
Blowjobs,ff0fjbp,t1_f2h23rp,1579468394.0,Took her back now... I called him simp but man would I take that ass back for some fun
HydroHomies,ff0cs2l,t1_ff088uv,1579467627.0,"Yeah man. True that. 
I really only live in hope of a bigger picture we can’t understand (yet?). I mean we can’t even really 100% explain where we / the universe came from (if it didn’t always exist). 

The things we don’t know that we don’t know are probably far more than the things we do know or know we don’t know (if this sentence makes sense to you). 

So there’s always hope for a meaning we can‘t or don‘t know about / understand. 

In the end it’s always just hope"
MapPorn,ff0awgk,t1_fezbhrv,1579467003.0,No don’t get it wrong. The most attractive 25% find a partner... We don’t :(

RoastMe,fekua9r,t3_epmugv,1579207738.0,So average you can’t roast him. Literally nothing exciting about him or anything standing out

Edit: oh okay. What the fuck does expert mean? And how does it determine this haha"
BikiniBottomTwitter,feh0dzd,t1_feguwks,1579106507.0,"Actually I agree. Prohibition is a bitch. Not everyone has to do drugs but every one should have the option to. Psychedelics can help with so much more than self actualization (which is already great!). 

They’re much more effective for quitting smoking than anything we ever invented for example"
BikiniBottomTwitter,feh07fo,t1_fegyo6l,1579106396.0,"Or: The first people to be people were the first people using drugs. /s. 

No but we’ve been using drugs since the very beginning. All of our ancestors have had some kind of drug culture. 

Since 2020 years ago! /s again"

PublicFreakout,fef03tz,t1_feesr4j,1579045050.0,Seriously ... I agree with you
PublicFreakout,feezy1w,t1_feepybs,1579044944.0,Just draw the obvious line at that then? You can’t compare those two examples
gifs,feeyt2j,t1_feeyf4t,1579044204.0,The fact that he always looks depressed is that he’s actually always depressed!
science,feey41b,t1_feevdr2,1579043754.0,Oh you’d be surprised about the history of drugs and society even going way back..
whatsapp,fdsqm3t,t3_en0s60,1578706676.0,Also I can not export chats to get an email example since it’s been banned in Germany
tifu,fdr1t9z,t1_fdqohqj,1578678347.0,Yeah sad but this happened to me. My friend didn’t inhale. It was the last weed for the night....
marijuanaenthusiasts,fdqgho3,t1_fdpvneh,1578666073.0,I know this is the joke. It’s obviously _not_ obvious that r/marijuanaenthusiasts is about trees

trees,fdnq2ty,t1_f0iw5ew,1578590706.0,Seriously tho

dataisbeautiful,fdl8tnc,t1_fdknn1f,1578519001.0,That’s a good point
dataisbeautiful,fdl8m8u,t1_fdjrmo4,1578518903.0,Damn that’s what a friend told me the last day. I thought 18-25 is the prime for most people and it’s downwards from there. That’s why I always have this urge/ sense in me to enjoy life as much as I can right now which isn’t really possible because I work too much. This changed my perspective a bit into planning longer term and not stressing myself too much
politics,fdjkftd,t1_fdjejol,1578475052.0,Can’t be true.... that’d be straight propaganda
dataisbeautiful,fdjh6iy,t1_fdj58bn,1578470634.0,Why would you want to be older?
AskReddit,fdi55pf,t1_fdi3tjb,1578435912.0,You know what. I was tired and thinking emotionally. You’re right. The discussion has to be how strict these laws are and that’s a big topic already

AskReddit,fdhwgwj,t1_fdhquug,1578431405.0,I know. A bad thing if the family hasn’t committed crimes
AskReddit,fdhqlqb,t1_fdhhhge,1578428233.0,That’s such bullshit anyways. Did they harm anyone? No one should be deported just because

WatchPeopleDieInside,fcs7y8y,t1_fcqd8yz,1577912706.0,The best thing that ever happened to me was that I found a machine that wasn’t rigged and actually held firm every time. I emptied the machine and the dude actually came to me (a little kid) and wanted to buy all the toys back for 2€... luckily my mom was with me and told him to fuck off
youseeingthisshit,fcs5vvy,t1_fcrf97f,1577911877.0,What context?

aww,fcmtxxu,t1_fcmq4h5,1577792113.0,I didn’t disagree with you. Funny how people downvote me because they’re just assuming I am. Of course you have to put a towel under your dog. So should dirty people. And their clothes aren’t clean like the towel I put under my dog. Their clothes stink just as much as they do...
ATBGE,fcmtvz7,t1_fcmlldt,1577792039.0,Nah. More in an ironic way of crying for someone else when he‘s facing a minor inconvenience but making a scene eg.: „Me when right wings can’t take their nazi boots into court“ (this happened in Germany btw)

wholesomegreentext,fck3eay,t1_fcjxb3k,1577715400.0,Honestly those are the only true friends that stay for life. Others may stay for life too but just because nothing bad came in between you
PublicFreakout,fcidnd4,t1_fci2kj9,1577660987.0,Exactly. That’s the problem we have in Germany. They shouldn’t let harmful people stay. But they do... such an easy fix but not so easy in practice it seems

specializedtools,fci1eq9,t1_fchm0vv,1577656590.0,I don’t think more criminalization is the way we’re headed to. We’re going toward legalizing everything but informing the public

antiwork,fc60jcx,t1_fc580k3,1577469591.0,It is pretty utopic and relies on a lot of beliefs. But the belief is that AI and robots will pretty mich take over 99% of jobs. Design will also be done by smart AI probably and if something breaks a robot can’t fix the AI will call human assistance. It’s pretty far off in the future and most people here shouldn’t dream about that really but hey who knows
