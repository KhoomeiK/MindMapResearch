relationships,fe051pf,t1_fe04jb9,1578803251.0,"She doesn't, but my traumatic experiences have contributed to the intense anger that I have."
relationships,fe04sey,t1_fe03zxm,1578803071.0,"I know I'm never going to have her love again, but I just want her to understand me because she's the only person I've ever loved."
relationships,fe043za,t1_fe03v36,1578802591.0,"I'm not saying what I did was okay, but jesus. I've had so much shit happen to me at once and at such a young age, and I bottled it up. No one is immune to things like that."
relationships,fe03rgy,t1_fe03lux,1578802335.0,Yeah but how many people have that much trauma?
relationships,fe03pi0,t1_fe03lux,1578802294.0,Define help
relationships,fe030o8,t1_fe02i16,1578801805.0,"I wanted her to understand that about me, but she doesn't want to listen to me. What should I say to her? All I want from her is to know that that's what happened and not that I'm a psychopath or something. She thinks I'm legitimately crazy."
relationships,fe02rli,t1_fe023m6,1578801625.0,You don't think that there's any way that things could work out between us?
relationships,fe02hfi,t1_fe029m9,1578801421.0,"I know, but you've gotta understand how hard that is for me given my circumstances."
relationships,fe02cc1,t1_fe023m6,1578801325.0,Thank you for your understanding
relationships,fe02570,t1_fe01yi7,1578801187.0,You say that but you haven't been through what I've been through. It's hard to do the right thing when everything is going wrong.
offmychest,fdzsoek,t1_fdxjlwj,1578794870.0,Why?
relationships,fdz5s1s,t1_fdz56n7,1578787000.0,"I don't expect for a therapiat to care about me, that's why I don't want to see one. I don't think a therapist could show me how to fix myself, I think the only thing that could fix someone like me is love."
relationships,fdz43e6,t1_fdz3adq,1578786442.0,You don't think we could at least be friends in the future? People can change.
relationships,fdz2yfl,t1_fdyzi3b,1578786139.0,"Yes I have, but it hasn't done anything for me. Talking to a therapist is not the same thing as talking to someone who actually knows you and cares about you. I just want her to understand me, and to see me for who I really am. It's hard to do the right thing when everything is going wrong. Most people who have been through the kinds of things that I have are in prison or are terrorists or something. I'm not like that, even though I said some really violent things. You know, when you're in a dark place your mind goes to a dark place too."
relationships,fdz2b9s,t1_fdyzjn1,1578785932.0,What exactly do you mean by help? Talking to someone who doesn't really care about me but it's their job to act like they do?
offmychest,fdxjiuy,t1_fdxi0wm,1578769315.0,You've done what 3 times?
offmychest,fdagtnh,t3_ek6u5r,1578245953.0,"I love you too, and a big virtual hug back."
offmychest,fca18fv,t1_fca0vt9,1577561391.0,Yeah she did do something to me
