Wellthatsucks,ff4o0ww,t1_ff484q4,1579568277.0,I had x-rays showing 4 impacted wisdom teeth and was schedules for surgery to get them removed almost immediately. They said they had to get them out sooner or later and it was better to do it sooner before they shifted around all of the rest of my teeth.
TooAfraidToAsk,ff4lwcf,t1_ff41ww2,1579566778.0,"Of course it does. Straight people may not be homophobic but since they will never have the prejudice directed at them, they may rarely witness homophobia and thus think it doesn't exist or isn't a big problem."
Showerthoughts,ff4isy6,t1_ff4cxu9,1579564629.0,"Ancient Runes was never a mandatory course in the books anyways, just an optional one. That's why harry and Ron never took it. They emphasised many times that the most important courses for harry and ron (both who became aurors) were defense against the dark arts, charms, transfiguration, potions. It is also stated that auror training takes a further three years after completions at hogwarts and considering most of the previous aurors had all died at the battle of hogwarts and before at the hand of death eaters, I think it makes a lot of sense that they went right on ahead to auror training since they had already proven themselves as being able to handle dark wizards at length and aurors were in short supply. In times of war, peoples credentials are often waved i. Plus hermione completed her 7th year and probably got Os in everything."

facepalm,feld3rh,t1_fekbqjz,1579219354.0,"I took engineering in Canada. Mostly used metric, but we had one thermodynamics professor who made us do some of our assignments sometimes in imperial units instead of metric because some of us might work for American companies and we should get use to it. Took us twice as long because we weren't used to the units and all of the conversions were irregular. We hated it so much."

Why wouldn't you make up your own mind, just like you do with all other stories and books? Belief that it is real is the whole point of getting others to subscribe to that doctrine that you want them to subscribe to. Religion has always and will always be about control."

AskReddit,fe4fx5s,t1_fe3zxqs,1578858863.0,"Experiment design involves practice of trying to repeat the exact same conditions over and over again. Scientists put a shitload of effort into making sure that conditions are as close as they can get over and over (i.e., same temperature, same pressure, same velocities, same materials, same conditions) went testing something. Then they repeat the tests over and over again to get a statistical average and only draw concrete conclusions when something is statistically significant and back their hypotheses. If the results indicate unexpected results or something seems unexplained, they don't draw conclusions at all and try and find new hypotheses to explain what is going on. Drawing back to your example, there is nothing hitting a piece of metal with a sledgehammer that can't be measured. The only factors are the materials Young's modulus, poisson's ratio, the temperature, the strain, the force, the area of the material, and the observed deformation of the material. All can be measured. If we didn't have a concrete understanding of the way that steel behaves under loads, we couldn't trust any of our bridges or skyscraper designs at all, but we do because we know exactly how steel behaves because of successful experimentation and can design these structures.

The the extraordinary success of pure science so far is majorly attributed to the perfection of this sort of experimentation. It a pretty robust method."
AskReddit,fe0p3lc,t1_fdznzkx,1578816996.0,You can tell via experimentation what the strain in materials are. People who do material testing do this sort of experimentation all of the time. How else would they find the exact values for Young's modulus for different metals? How would they find out exactly under which loads materials would break? This is a perfect example of a repeatable experiment actually. Just because you can't visually identify it doesn't mean that the difference in the strain of a material can't be measured.

AskReddit,fdxvgad,t1_fdwnaye,1578773343.0,"This is about statistics and scientific experimentation, this is not about discouraging practice and improvement. Einstein was not wrong here. If you find you make progress by doing the same thing over again, it is actually because you are modifying the way you do things in order to improve. If you actually did the exact same thing over and over again one must expect the same results if the process is repeatable."

science,fcwqojh,t1_fcvxcmf,1578033842.0,I think the decrease in health of people was more related to the diseases that developed due to farming livestock and more people living together in groups once agriculture was invented because people could stay put in villages as opposed to moving all the time to find food. I haven't heard any evidence that this was nutrition related.

AdviceAnimals,fctuajx,t1_fctni4z,1577959883.0,"A lot of people who make Charcuterie put a lot of effort into the selection of the cheeses, olives, meats, pate, crackers, etc. Some even go as far to pair specific wines with the cheeses and olives specifically.

It may be instagram trendy recently, but people who make and enjoy wine have been doing this for hundreds of years and they did not do it for the instagram fame of it."
