AskReddit,fegny6w,t3_ep1mtj,1579098352.0,Make a video to my children about how much I love them and my wishes for them to carry on and live their best lives.  And let my parents know that I felt loved every day of my life because of them.
offmychest,fefpus1,t3_eouk6d,1579061829.0,"Maybe it's a ""grass is greener"" kind of thing? As a white American, I grew up wishing I was Asian.  I find Asian people to be so beautiful and the Asian cultures always fascinated me.  I think sometimes we just crave something different than what we're used to.  They say variety is the spice of life.  
As for being attracted to taller guys - that could be part of our human survival instincts still playing a part.  Women wanting the most formidable partner for protection, hunting, survival, etc. Just like most men like big boobs and curvy hips in women that signal fertility to keep the species going.  
I don't think you should feel bad about what attracts you, you can't help that."
relationship_advice,fe9wm4s,t1_fe9pctc,1578942110.0,"Haha, it's indeed real.  I guess the contractions and hormones released during climax can set things off if the body has already begun preparations (ripening cervix, etc.)"
relationship_advice,fe9kwmc,t3_eo5r91,1578938812.0,It's pretty messed up that you shouted and called him out on it.  How traumatizing for him.  You should have just left quietly and let his parents know so they can deal with it how they see fit.  It almost sounds like you were waiting for this to happen so you could shame him about it.  Weird.
relationship_advice,fe9i4xq,t3_eo3nno,1578937741.0,"I would tell her anonymously somehow.  That way, she gets the truth and can look into it if she chooses to and it won't make things awkward when you see each other in passing. 
I would hope someone would tell me."
relationship_advice,fe9akao,t1_fe8qfdp,1578935881.0,"Hey, you make it work.  It's temporary.  The baby will be fine right up until she goes into labor.  Doctors will even tell you to have sex if you're trying to naturally induce labor at the end of the pregnancy. 

But like others have said, just share your concerns with her and understand that the hormones coursing through her body right now make everything seem 10 times worse.  I once bawled my eyes out because a restaurant was out of something I was craving lol. 

If she continues to shut you out, maybe write a heart felt letter about your feelings and leave it on her pillow so she can read and process it in her own time. 

This will pass and I'm sure you'll both laugh about this one day.  Best of luck and congrats on the little one!"
NoStupidQuestions,fdl6oay,t3_elwglg,1578517961.0,"It looks like a shrimp-possum, or a shrimpossum, if you will."
confessions,fdhcjdl,t3_elarx6,1578419939.0,"That's tough.  There was a girl I knew growing up that wasn't nice to me.  She didn't exactly go out of her way to torment me, but she was friends with people who did bully me. She definitely made it clear she didn't like me and would purposely exclude only me. Years later she became terminally ill and everyone began gushing about how wonderful she was and that she was such a lovely person with a beautiful heart, blah blah blah.  I felt bad for her family and friends, but I couldn't help but feel angry that for whatever reason I was the one person that was victim to the mean and hurtful side of her.  
If you think you can stand being around a bunch of people praising your bully like she was some saint of a person, then go if you feel God wants you too.  Just prepare yourself mentally and emotionally."
confessions,fde54rg,t1_fddd7lj,1578331394.0,"My older brother is physically disabled and played sports in a special Olympics type league so we were frequently around lots of kids and young adults with downs.  Some were sweet and quiet, some were mean and some were downright inappropriate because they didn't know any better.  I was a shy little girl amongst these kids and I had enough bad experiences that even now I get uncomfortable around downs people because of their unpredictability.   Call me harsh, but between my experiences and my social anxiety, that's just how it is for me. I have a hard time with knowing how to react to behavior that is out of the ""norm"" and get incredibly stressed out in these situations.  It's not like I hate them or anything and I'm thankful for people who make it their life's work to work with these kids and give them joy and love.  I think I was kind of scarred by my experiences as a child.  I'm sure it would be different if it was my own child, I know I would love that child with all my heart and it's my wish that all downs kids have someone loving in their life."
offmychest,fcyxbv2,t3_ejdc6m,1578089137.0,"Thank you for sharing your story.  I'm so sorry you went through that, but I'm glad you were rescued and have a good support system. 

I'm going to share this with someone I know who is young, beautiful, and getting into modeling.  This is a huge fear I have for her. 

Best wishes for your continued healing."
AskReddit,fcy3qgw,t1_fcwna4v,1578074390.0,"This!  My parents, especially my dad raised me this way.  I'm in my 40s and I'm still trying to teach myself that the queen and the pawn all go back into the same box at the end of the game."
AskReddit,fcy29f4,t3_eje7fc,1578073810.0,"I had just come out of the grocery store and was putting my two bags of groceries that I carried out into the backseat of my car.  It was a crazy windy day and suddenly a rogue cart from somewhere nearby starting barreling across the parking lot.  I ran and tried to grab it, but it was rolling way too fast and it slammed right into someone's car across the lot.  A woman nearby turned to look just in time to see me, arms outstretched toward the cart, and the cart right as it smashed into the car.  I'm sure it looked like I pushed the cart toward the car.  I've never been glared at harder in all my life.  She shook her head at me and got into her car before I could muster any words to explain."
AskReddit,fcoh6xf,t3_ei4bkv,1577832139.0,I hope Gordon Ramsey brings his knives.
offmychest,fckcbuy,t1_fck4i1d,1577722127.0,I do this too.  I love going to the movies by myself!
