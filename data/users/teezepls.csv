Drugs,ff4slmo,t1_ff38hp2,1579571451.0,I always seem to find that comment on reddit. Always reminds me to keep doing what I’m doing
apexlegends,ff2s1tk,t1_ff2rop0,1579521636.0,"I never said it was the subs fault. I agree that the devs could do a better overall job improving the game but I don’t think some small positive praise like this is doing any harm. They get a lot of slack, which to be fair is in good reason, but some reassurance that they are at least not ignoring everything is nice."
apexlegends,ff2ralx,t1_ff2r0ou,1579520580.0,"Lmao I know I’m late but I just found this old post. There’s a lot of negativity on this sub, I’m just trying to spread some good"

PublicFreakout,fdvdl5x,t1_fduw8tn,1578746288.0,I think that if they are raping these kids they don’t have the brains to think that far ahead. Either that or their impulses take over. Both are fucked

dataisbeautiful,fcsnzj3,t3_eij4pn,1577920758.0,Something I’ve been wrapping my head around more and more lately is that some people don’t poop everyday. I’ve literally had to poop at least once a day for as long as I remember. Most I ever pooped in a day was maybe 4-5 times.

unpopularopinion,fbwhrrp,t3_eeloum,1577150269.0,"You’re an idiot. I’m an idiot. We’re all idiots really. The sooner people realize that we don’t know anything and have everything to learn is when we’ll know. 

Know what? I don’t know. I wanted to say something deep but couldn’t come up with anything. Like I said, I’m an idiot."
