AskReddit,ffeqktj,t1_ffd91v6,1579860574.0,"Last year, annual Halloween Party; I had quite a bit to drink as is customary before the beer pong starts. 

During the face off to see which team goes first I got tired of missing so I stopped actually trying and was going to let my wingman win the faceoff for us. We counted to three, I threw the ball and walked away, trying to be all cool.

Except...IT WORKED. I hot the other teams ball out of the air backwards and it landed in a cup. I missed the whole thing but looked like a badass but I missed seeing the incredible shot."

Depending on where you were hit, they might have pulled it out or attempted to save the existing body. 

Here where I live, it's pretty common for a body shop to just buy a new cut of a straight one from the wrecking yard and then cut out all the damaged steel and weld the two together.
