I also understand the importance of scrutiny and scepticism before jumping on a narrative bandwagon. Further, your argument does have merit, don't get me wrong—however, you're disregarding a fair amount of circumstantial evidence that they do know each other, outside of the Lev's video. 

You do make an important point that is quickly forgotten: Lev was very recently working with these people, he's under criminal indictment, and now he's on a media campaign to save himself—not because he's suddenly realised the error of his ways, but because he's cornered and desperate. He's not credible in general, but it's crucial that much of the documentary evidence he's revealed, much like Cohen, should be taken seriously. Nevertheless, what he says should be evaluated with utmost caution."

""CNN has a tendency to twist facts, at times, to promote a self-serving narrative"" is a more accurate and fair statement. They're leagues less brazenly propagandist than right wing media platforms. Fox, Breitbart, r/conservative, T_D, the list goes on.

I studied about 100k pages preparing for my ongoing case, and considered the applicable principles across the world. I'm not from the US but I've analysed your major supreme court cases on the issue. State law does diverge on certain aspects but the fundamentals share a common source.

As soon as the proceedings terminated in your favour, you could have launched a civil claim for malicious prosecution. But, as I said, in your particular case, definitely not worth the risk or effort since the harm you suffered was relatively insignificant. If you'd been arrested and detained—entirely different story. 

Just pointing out that ignorance of the law is no excuse for police. In fact, they ought to be held to a higher standard than the public given their training and duty of care.
