SpaceForce,ffgzk69,t1_ffgzh1w,1579919124.0,Maybe. Stamp us out before we could become a threat. Sorta like getting rid of the ant nest before they take over your yard.
SpaceForce,ffgze9n,t1_ffgz8i7,1579919001.0,Or bring us our first interstellar war...
SpaceForce,ffgz430,t1_ffgyyfc,1579918789.0,"Oh yeah, I’ve seen that. Very cool and inspiring. I hope one day it’s a reality."
SpaceForce,ffgyubw,t1_ffgxjr6,1579918583.0,"One step at a time. Right now, they’re bringing all military related space stuff under one command, rather than spread out between 2-3 different agencies. And right now, we can’t really leave this big blue marble we’re hurling through space on. Sure, we can get to the moon, we can send probes and stuff across the solar system, but interstellar travel is still fantasy material for the time being. We’ll have to figure out how to negate the laws of physics or find a loophole in physics before we can have interstellar travel. 

Because even if we managed to figure out how to build an FTL Drive, we’ll all be dead before we get a message back from our explorers... unless they’re at Alpha Centauri, which would be 8 years before we got anything back from them. And how good would the signal be anyway? It’d be like being in NYC and trying to hit a speck of dust traveling along I-5 somewhere in California. 

So, it’s one step at a time."
SpaceForce,ffgxyf3,t3_ethrbg,1579917926.0,"Honestly, linking past with future is a good message. One of linage and hope, and of ambition. Right now it’s bringing satellites and other military space concerns under one branch command, rather than being under Air Force, NASA, and the Navy. Others have mentioned the Flying Delta is historical in our military, Gene Roddenberry used a stylized version for Starfleet Command... and using this symbol now is a nod to that, it’s a nod to military history, and it’s an optimistic look to the future. Though I’m not Air Force, I think they have the Delta symbol in some of their unit patches as well, so it’s not unheard of."
SpaceForce,ffgursj,t3_ehc9lb,1579915585.0,"Essentially every branch of the military lol. Finally, you launch. When you’ve returned, it’s been eighteen months since you’ve seen your family, who are all waiting to see you. But first you have to wait in the shuttle for an hour and a half, nobody tells you why, and when you do finally get off it takes an additional hour and a half to turn in weapons and sensitive items. Then, you get to see your family... from afar as the base commander goes on and on and on about god knows what while sweat is lubricating your ass crack and your balls/hoo-ha itches because you haven’t showered in a few days because you were too busy getting everything packed for redeployment. After about another hour and a half of speeches from every self-important fuckstick in the region... you are finally released. You’ve been thinking about how great it’ll be to get laid finally, but instead the next several days are spent mostly sleeping and eating and showering and... being by yourself for once. 

Your spouse fails to understand and it leads to a fight. Your kids think you’re a complete stranger and an insane asshole. It’ll take a while, but with some work it’ll be ok. Or it won’t, especially if Jody was warming your bed while you were gone."
musictheory,ffg7p60,t3_et9298,1579900247.0,"I don’t have a music career, but I was at a big New Year’s Eve party about twenty years ago. Middle of nowhere, big crowd. Mix of cowboys and bikers... I know this sounds like a strange mixture, but in BFE Montana it’s normal. 

Anyway, my wife and I were new to Montana and my best friend apparently knew the band because I’m standing there filling a Dixie cup with beer when the band calls me up. I almost didn’t go, but my wife and several other people were really encouraging me, so up I went. 

I don’t remember what I played, but I absolutely forgot the lyrics to the second song I played and stopped mid chorus and just left the stage. The band was great, not good mind you, but nice bunch of guys. They tried to get me back up but I was done. I was so embarrassed lol. And talk about pissing off the crowd! Lol Apparently they were really into it. 

I was put on the spot, so it’s not like I have a running set list going. I didn’t have a huge library of shit to play, but I learned that if I ever do that again, have a game plan. 

I also learned that it’s important to know the song inside and out, back to front. I knew the songs I was playing, but not well enough to be confident. Today I could play those songs and it would be fine. 

I also learned that it’s ok. Screw up, it’s fine. Laugh it off, make a joke, try again. Relax and have a good time, because if I’m having a good time the crowd will too. And if it’s a small screw up, a bad note, then just go with it. Nobody notices. One time I was playing a song and accidentally hit a wrong chord. Rather than stop and start over, I ran it in a different key for a few bars, improvised vocally, then went back to the original key with a second round of the chorus. They thought it was great! Lol The joke’s on them tho because I totally screwed up!"

Specific to Star Citizen, I watched YouTuber BadNewsBaron and saw him explain his stick setup and so that’s what I got: a T16000M and a LogiTech Extreme Pro, but I never quite got them to work together.

starcitizen,ff4begd,t1_ff4a6ct,1579559672.0,"Yeah, that was my intent, along with the ability to update as needed. I’m sure my old pc build would  have been able to do that as well, but I bought it on a smaller budget. But I’m keeping the ATX case to put my build into that, it’s a fairly big case and everything should fit. It also has the bonus of liquid cooling already, and I’m hoping I won’t have to get a new liquid cooling system. Everything else though... I wanted to run my games without a problem... FO4 has some performance issues if I don’t set everything to medium and when I add mods, it’s just ugly. I’m sure an SSD would have fixed that, but I wanted a better build anyway."

It does take as much room to use, you just jab it into the skull. It has the cross piece on the blade to ensure that you don’t go too far, which enables you to pull the spear point out quickly in order to continue relatively quiet zombie extermination. Of course, save your bullets for the very much alive monsters that are all too willing to kill you and take all you have."
Thetruthishere,fei6lgg,t3_ep3cid,1579131426.0,"I’ve long held the same idea. I’ve another idea that in some cases, the emotional energy tied to a place is so extreme that it leaves an imprint and this is why we find old asylums, hospitals, battlefields, and the like that are reportedly haunted. In other cases, parallel worlds are bleeding into ours and vice versa, so while we are experiencing a haunting, they are too. I believe this veil is paper thin and this is why there’s bleed through when the two worlds rub together. 

At the end of the day... our perception of reality is limited. Things are far more complex and strange than we’d admit, though it’s possible that it’s just simply beyond comprehension. It’s like when I showed my daughter Venus in the evening sky and told her that planet was 110 million miles away. She couldn’t comprehend it. I showed her Orion and told her it was 1300 light years away and said that light was the fastest thing we can see in the galaxy and that it takes 1300 years for the light from Orion’s stars to reach us. She found the concept incomprehensible. I believe this is the same for the rest of us regarding a great many things in this universe. The multiverse, parallel dimensions, whatever you wish to call them."

The biggest tell earlier on was Micah and Dutch talking as they’re on their way to meet Colm. There was nothing genuine in that whole conversation. Micah and Dutch both spoke like it was just a contrived line of BS.

If speed is a factor we’re talking about with swords, women can have just as much speed. They have just as good eye hand coordination. We see this all the time.

I fight with self worth, I fight with unwarranted anger, I fight how I view the world, I fight my view of who I am. I fight with how sometimes I still hate myself... there’s no reason for it. I know I’m a good person, I know I am loved, but it persists, though less so now than it did before. I wish it would go away... but I do my best not to let my children think that way about themselves. I constantly reassure them that they’re good people, that I love them even if I get angry about something. 

When I have bad days, because they happen, I’ll let them know about it. I’ll explain what’s going on and that I’m struggling with whatever it is at the time. I’ll let them know I need to be alone because I don’t want to be mean and I’m afraid sometimes that when I’m having a rough time that I might be and I don’t want to be. I’m open and honest with my kids. They know life can be struggle, that it’s ok. We work through it and push forward. And I won’t hide that from them. It’s helped them, I think.

Like today... it’s been off. My thoughts have been a bit dark. Just a mix of garbage, though nothing serious. Some doubts about our move to Montana, though that’s just the pessimist in me and I’m fighting against all that today. It’s ok. It’ll pass. Maybe I need some sleep, or maybe a long shower.

aliens,fdrwup1,t1_fdpua6u,1578690872.0,"They certainly are very interesting shapes; there’s one on the left has that roundish shape too. I don’t know why that is, I’m not entirely sure our geology fully applies to Mars as it’s a dead planet and I can’t imagine it has too much water erosion, though I have seen photos of water erosion in mars so if I’m honest, I can’t say water didn’t cause those rock shapes. 

However they ended up that way, round, looking like it’s potentially part of a column... it makes you think. Don’t it? I know I wonder about it. I mean we know Mars was once Earth-like. Long, long ago. Who’s to say civilization didn’t exist there? Until we have boots on the ground, we may never know. And even then, if it’s government agencies, we still may never know."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdruuqn,t1_fdrtdue,1578690149.0,"Because of biased statistics, which you swallow whole. Like I said, in the 43 years of my existence, I have never seen pitbulls do evil things. I’ve only seen bad dog owners. 

Did you know that a pitbull used to be America’s #1 family pet? All of these statistics created to make the dog seem inherently bad are recent. Like from the last decade or two. Know what else? My city just unbanned pitbulls because they realized the statistics are biased. 

I could do the same thing. Without doing a study on any other animal, I can prove to you that house cats are the single, solitary threat to families all over the world. But it wouldn’t be true. My sister was once mauled by a chocolate lab who wandered into our yard. I was once bit by cocker spaniel. My wife has been caused to bleed twice by Chihuahuas who chased her down just to bite her. None of us ever attacked by a pitbull. 

Our pitbull has been best friends with our son since he was 1 year old. She’s never once been aggressive. He’s hurt her on occasion, not knowing any better when he was little, and she never got angry. He broke her tail when he was 3. She never hurt him. 

So tell me how pitbulls are evil? How they’re inherently bad? How it’s in their nature to kill babies?"
TrueOffMyChest,fdrsljl,t3_emv6r6,1578689052.0,"I grew up abused, homeless half the time, starving half to death. I never fit in at school, it was very obvious we were poor and other kids just can’t keep themselves from making fun. It was “I saw Eddie moving today. Yeah, he was kicking a can down the street because they got evicted from the Safeway parking lot!” 

It’s true, lots of times we did live in a camp trailer in various parking lots, but the kids always made it out to be a soda can. It’s not like I ever told anybody anything. I never had anybody over. I was embarrassed. I was ashamed that I couldn’t have new shoes like those other kids. 

I grew up knowing for an absolute fact that I would be nothing. Nobody. That all the days of my life, I would be a worthless piece of shit. What a gift, huh? What a gift for parents to give to their children! To tell us all through our childhood that we’ll never be good enough. Well... except for my half brother. He could never be wrong, never do wrong, and when he did do wrong it was me that got punished and it didn’t take long before he began to do things on purpose to get me in trouble. He was five years younger than me and he knew that if he did something he shouldn’t, I would get the unholy fuck beat out of me and I’d go to bed without anything to eat, if we had food. 

I grew up combing the sides of the road for recyclables, digging in garbage cans and dumpsters, even doing that to find items just expired; sodas, bread... 

And I had 3 parents. My mom, stepdad, and real dad. By the time I was a teenager I was so... angry. I loathed myself so much. I tried to kill myself once, found myself in a mental hospital for a week. It was no help. I drank a lot. I drank a lot all the way into my 30’s. 

When I was 20, my life going nowhere, I joined the army. Best thing I could have done. I wasn’t a good soldier, but I did my best. I had something to have a little pride in. I’d never had that before. Went to Bosnia, then ETS’d. 

Got married when I was 23. Went into the National guard. I was a drunk and we were so poor. But my wife was, and is the most wonderful person. Stuck with me and loved me no matter what. Eventually my daughter was born. I went to Iraq, came home a different person. Stopped drinking when I was in my 30’s. 

Today we own our house and we’re about to move from Seattle to Montana. We have two kids, both teenagers. My daughter’s a junior and looking at college for psychology. I’ve worked myself nearly to death to make sure we bought this house we live in so that my kids wouldn’t be constantly moving. My refrigerator and pantry are overfilled, nobody goes hungry in this house. When we buy our new house in Montana, I’ll continue with that. I have NEVER told my kids they were worthless, unwanted, or any other thing like that. I’ve never beat them. I don’t play favorites, and if you did something wrong, you’re the only person who will get in trouble; you’ll only answer for your own misbehavior, and not that of your sibling. There is nothing but love in this family. 

So, I guess what I’m saying is I understand. I’m glad you changed your life. I’m glad you will not do that to your own little family. I’m glad you’re breaking those chains."

I treat her well, I feed her, I don’t beat her, I keep her well fenced. She’s part of the family, just like any other dog we might have, have had. There is nothing in their nature that makes them more prone to tearing into an old lady, or whatever else the news media makes claims to. 

I’ve been bitten bitten by FAR more Chihuahuas than I have any other dog. Never once in 43 years been bitten by a Pit tho. They’re good dogs."

I hope the criminal in the OP stays in jail a long time for what he did. As for the commenter, there aren’t bad pitbulls, just bad owners. It’s like any other dog... if you’re a bad owner, you’ll have a bad dog. Simple as that. Treat your animals well and don’t abuse them. Train them, love them, socialize them and you will end up with a good dog regardless of the breed."

FuckYouKaren,fdq2p35,t3_em91cl,1578651928.0,"I went to Walmart earlier and saw a couple stalks down that this woman had parked herself diagonally across two parking spots. I saw her get out of the car and was behind her when she went into Walmart. The parking lot was pretty full. When I came out, she was standing by her car shouting, red faced, and crying. I didn’t see t first what had happened, but it didn’t long. Someone had smashed her windows, broke her headlights and taillights, and left a huge dent in the drivers door. All I could do was smile. I don’t condone doing things like this, but sometimes a body just flat deserves it."
offmychest,fdq2c3y,t3_emoezv,1578651417.0,"We all change. I had friends that I hung onto for a couple decades that were wrong for me. Serious pieces of shit, one went to prison and the other is just a scuzzy, nasty, sociopathic, pathological liar who’s sole purpose is to use people. I’ve cut them both out of my life. I’ve cut family out who were drunks, addicts, and abusers. I used to be like all of them in some ways. I negotiated with my fists, I stole, I sometimes used drugs and I drank a lot. I treated people like shit. To me they were just a nothing and deserved whatever they got, but I changed. I joined the army and I changed. 

One day I was married and had a daughter and I just changed. I knew I cared about more than myself, though at that time I was still a drunk. 

I went to Iraq and when I came home, I wasn’t the same person. I’d changed again. My wife had to get to know me all over again, and I her. She’d changed too. She was stronger, more independent, not that she wasn’t this before but now she didn’t NEED me for anything at all. And I didn’t deal with that well. 

We never divorced, though there were plenty of times when I thought we would. As things became more stable with me, I changed again. I’m not so angry, I don’t drink, I do my best to be a good father and husband. 

What I’m saying is change is inevitable. You just have to accept it and move on. Life’s short, get rid of anybody and anything that doesn’t reflect the love and care you give to it. It’s like feeding money into a slot machine; most the time you can give it money nonstop all day and never win. It doesn’t give back, only takes and friends and family can be like that and when it’s their habit to take and never give... you’ll go broke. You’ll exhaust all the life that you have in you and you’ll become bitter and mean. It’s not worth it. Let them go and find those people that agree that friendship is give and take. 

Good luck, and I hope things improve for you."

Isn’t that amazing! Sorry, off topic a bit, but my god that is inconceivable! What a wonderful age we live in!!! 

Ok, back on topic... the pic could just be an interesting rock, or it could be part of a column, or it could be some other thing and it’s very unfortunate that we can’t trust governments to be truthful. Because even if it was remnants of an ancient ruin from a very long lost Martian civilization... the government would say it was just a rock. 

But for our purposes, being that these photos just aren’t clear enough, we could do much speculation about it. Personally, I imagine it’s part of a very ancient ruin. Maybe when that world was destroyed, part of it hit Earth and seeded some of our life. It may not have happened like that, but it’s certainly interesting to think about."

firefly,fdoiw2z,t3_emd174,1578606050.0,"New crew, new ship (or Mal sold Serenity), new stories, same universe. Only way a Firefly Revival makes sense. Maybe appropriate original cast plays some role in this new series; mentors, boss... something useful to the new story. We can’t resurrect the same Firefly that left us with the movie Serenity. Wash is dead, Book is dead (in real life too), and too much time has passed since then and they’ll never again catch that same magic with the old cast that they did back then... but they CAN build a NEW magic with a new ship or the same old ship, a new cast, and let at least Fillon take a part in the show, but not in the same capacity or role that he did before. Mal could be retired. Or maybe Mal could still be the aged captain but with a new crew. Or maybe something else entirely, but still Mal. 

Whatever the case, this really has to be a new story with a new crew or it will really do a disservice to the original series."
