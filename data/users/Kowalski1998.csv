zillakami,fclbnxn,t3_ehkhfz,1577744103.0,How does a country like that exist. Itâ€™s not like youâ€™re doing those crimes just listening to music about it so youâ€™ll be fine anywhere
SuicideBoys,fc6y0fh,t3_eg9ysf,1577492410.0,We all do I love them but with time I feel like theyâ€™re getting worse and worse in terms of music but thatâ€™s just my opinion
leaves,fbw1me8,t3_eekspn,1577139232.0,Same position and Iâ€™m confused how am I this addicted. Like itâ€™s only weed and feels like Iâ€™m addicted to something worse. And yeah Iâ€™m in the UK as well but Iâ€™m only like 2 days sober and thatâ€™s because Iâ€™m away from home atm but when I get back it will be hard to stay away from it because all my friends smoke it 24/7
