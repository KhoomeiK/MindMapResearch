I was taught by my parents and community that only lazy and weak people took drugs for mental illness (something I now know came from a place of ignorance and self-righteous). I refused to do it for a long time. I only ""gave in"" when things started getting really bad and I could honestly say I had tried everything else. Even then I just sat and stared at the pills for hours after i got them, working up my nerve.

TooAfraidToAsk,ff4phgy,t1_ff4ni92,1579569308.0,"Even though it may be technically possible for any woman to produce milk, there are plenty of reasons not to do so just for kicks.

If you're not expressing milk regularly, like every couple of hours 24/7, you run the risk of clots. Those are painful all on their own, but they can also cause a flu-like sickness if untreated. 

Boobs filled with milk may look great, but they can be super tender and even painful when touched. And the increased size is really a curse in disguise. Once you stop producing milk, the volume may go down, but your skin has been stretched, leaving you a lot more floppy and squishy than you were before. 

The more you know."

I grew up with an abusive and toxic religion, and I've found that being away from religion and spirituality completely is very good for me. 

On the other hand, I have a friend who grew up in the same church, also suffers from depression, but is very passionate about her relationship with Christ. However, she's very vigilante about the kind of church community she involves herself with. Recently moved to a new city and visited at least five difference ones until she found one that was non-toxic and a good fit.  

I believe if religion is done right, it can have a very fulfilling place in people's lives. Unfortunately it's been used as a method of control and abuse too often and for too long that it's not reliable. It definitely don't think it should be someone's only source of help and guidance."

I joined a support group for emotional eating on FB that has been helpful. The main idea is to address the underlying cause of your addiction (shopping in your case). What is missing  or damaged in your life that you need to turn to artificial/temporary sources of joy?

You assume that others aren't sincere, and you don't see yourself as worthy of their friendship either. 

The best way I've found to deal with this is to look at the evidence I do have. Maybe I have an awkward conversation with someone that makes me think they must hate me on the inside.

At the end of day, I feel the wedding is for the sake of your family and friends, and including them in your big day. And there are other things you can do besides a big wedding.

Quietly elope, then have a big house-warming party where someone ""marries"" you.

Marriage is about the two people who are to be married. A wedding is not going to make or break your marriage, that notion is so absurd it's making my brain hurt. 

My husband and I had a courthouse wedding for practical reasons as well, but we told very few people and had a conventional wedding later when we were ready.

Also people who are faced with mental illness regularly (whether it's their own or someone close to them) sometimes let go of their prejudices as they learn more. However, my parents' generation is the main reason I can't bring myself to be open about my own mental illness. I know too many people who are staunchly set in their ways, and I don't have the energy to deal with their criticism or try to educate them myself. 

There was also an interesting study done a few years ago (will link if I can find it again), about people's tendency to dismiss factual evidence if it didn't support their own beliefs.

There's also the fact that it takes a while for kids to learn to play on their own. Mine is almost three now, and he can go for about an hour a day on his own, but inevitably he wants someone else to play with. Part of that is definitely because he's limited by his own abilities.
