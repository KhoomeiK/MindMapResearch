OhioMarijuana,ffmg1i7,t3_eu6s9i,1580054192.0,Ohio Marijuana Card is the most expensive doctor office in ohio and somehow they’re the shittiest too. I can’t tell u how many patients i’ve heard ab going to their renewal and having to wait up to a week for them to upload the recommendation because they over schedule so they have way too many patients to take care of but for some reason they’re still accepting new patients. It’s honestly a shit show. I would find somewhere cheaper to go like ohio green team. they only charge $100

witchcraft,ffgctbv,t1_ffg3emk,1579903388.0,"the point of meditation in a witch’s practice is to ground one’s self and to raise your aura & your vibrational frequency which inherently repels negative energy (ie. negative entities, or “demons”) . so while it may make sense through the eyes of a christian how meditation could be dangerous, it doesn’t make sense to me personally as a witch. but that’s just me! we all have different beliefs and that is totally cool"
AskHR,ffgc88x,t1_ffg1dzs,1579903029.0,"i get that its frustrating to have to explain this to people, but the person did say its their first job, so of course they didn’t know. you didn’t have to be rude about it. you could have just told them without the condescending tone."

OhioMarijuana,ff9o3bw,t1_ff9nqy3,1579717044.0,I agree completely. It’s really unfortunate that this happened.

OhioMarijuana,ff9laop,t1_ff9ka90,1579715391.0,"to be fair, its not like Bloom did this intentionally. i’m sure the staff had absolutely nothing to do with it and they can still run a nice dispensary that ur family member has a good opinion of, even if their higher ups are clearly fucking up in terms of their data safety procedures."
OhioMarijuana,ff7tfkn,t1_ff7te75,1579657933.0,"well its the same thing, i just printed mine out"
OhioMarijuana,ff7kgqg,t3_es32ic,1579651677.0,"There’s two separate places that you have “expiration dates” for. One is your physical card that the dispensary scans when u get there (which is the one u got the email about expiring 2/29/2020) and then your “fill cycle” which is the one that expires in 8 days. the “fill cycle” is your 90 day prescription that allows you to actually purchase the product, whereas the card is just your identification within the program that allows you to carry your product with you places."
