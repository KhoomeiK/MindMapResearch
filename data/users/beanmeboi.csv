My ass HURTS after sitting in these chairs for more than an hour, let alone the 8 hours I’m at school.

I really like Vegas and I obviously don’t drink,smoke or go to strip clubs. Neither of my parents drink or smoke and they love it... hell we took my grandpa and grandma and they had a great time despite not drinking or smoking.
