Because the uh... grateful people you come across will give you their daughters to fuck and you do the flaming dick thing so they think you're a god or something.

She has nothing to base this on other than the fact we're a poly family. The father of these kids was a pigwit bigot so I'm sure he was involved. If she'd said oh, I'm not comfortable with anyone but us I'd have understood. I asked her to pay me back... anything out of my investment and she refused.
