BlackPeopleTwitter,fdsob8g,t1_fdsdxwi,1578705834.0,"Island communities are geographically isolated though, bit different to a continental village in Egypt. Also pretty much every Scottish island has been influenced by Dal Riatha in the 600s and the Norse in the 800s to 900s, so there's still genetic mixing going on there."

Admittedly they could be hiding their ownership but I have friends who work at them and they've always told me that they're privately owned. Although tbh my town isn't very large, only 8,000 people, so maybe it's more common in large towns to have chains own pubs."

interestingasfuck,fdilwqu,t1_fdi84vq,1578445828.0,"I had a conversation with my irish grandfather recently, and he told me about a story he was told by the groundskeeper at his school when he was young (sometime in the mid to late 1940s). He told him about the time in 1916 when his father as a 13 year old held up a knife to the groundskeeper, handed him a Bible and made him swear an oath of allegiance to the rebels who were partaking in the Easter rising at that time. It's wild to think that was over 100 years ago now."
