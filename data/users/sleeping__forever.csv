SuicideWatch,ff4tlok,t1_ff4t7nc,1579572138.0,"3 years ago I was a completely different person. I had something happen to me (most likely vertigo) Sept 2018 and it honestly ruined me. Created soooooooo much anxiety and fear me. I cant emphasize enough how much that incident has changed me and has since followed with constant dizziness/faintness and constant reassurance from doctors.  (anxiety)

Typical day is honestly just pushing through work. No activities or hobbies outside of work. No friends either. I feel I cant express myself because I dont want to burden others with my defeat and because I cry so hard you cant understand me.

I've talked to my sisters and husband. I'm in counseling too. My husband lost his dad at 16, hes about to lose his mom. Hes only 24. I don't want him worried about losing his wife too. I talk to him about it but I'm not 100% open because I dont know I just dont want to say it outloud how sad I am I guess because I'm in denial
