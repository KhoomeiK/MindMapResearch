Futurology,ffh8mr0,t1_ffgppom,1579926254.0,"it reads like those studies done by people in a field completely separate from the field the author of the study is involved in. like economists dealing with things like dating or other fields they have no specialization in except for their application of statistics. but they fail to point out that statistics can be heavily manipulated and can be very unreliable when applied by a person with an agenda. 

this reads like that mit study of the boston school busing schedule and how they fixed it to allow kids not have to put up with insane schedules. but they eventually went back to their old schedule because the wealthy and powerful did not like that the schedule did not fit their own personal schedule. and inconvenienced them. so they pushed back and they had to go back to the way things were. 

traffic will never be a solvable problem due to the imbalance of power.

I can't seem to find anything regarding rapes when it comes to south asians. but that's a very disturbing thing in that there's no demographic data regarding rapes in the west. a lot of crime statistics in america puts asians in an others category because of how few crimes they commit. but at the same time it hides that possibility that many of the asian females are victims at an insanely high rate and very likely having their perpetrator not be a person of their own ethnic group."

BUT BUT BUT THE STEREOTYPES SAYS THAT ASIAN ARE CRIMINALS AND RAPE ALL THE TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

no, this is the classic case of people projecting their own deficiency on a race of people in a desperate attempt to brainwash females into believing them. I bet a lot of females are putting themselves into very real danger because they see the world through these stereotypes. bet a lot of females been to europe or america and have gotten raped but are too ashamed to tell others. if they had done so everybody would have realized how much social engineering and lies have shaped their views of the world.

whattabout all those posts about gang rapes in india? I bet a lot of the gang rapes are occurring in places that are comparable to the ghettos of america. these are places nobody would ever think of going and would not be surprised if they got violated there. so you have these naive tourists who see the people via stereotypes and travels to the worst ghettos of india and then get violated and then go around telling everybody that india is a crime ridden country.

on the other hand in america, rape is a part of the culture. a lot of parties involve running trains on a female and nobody gets charged with rape. Rape is so common in america they don't bother reporting it on the news. but in india the chance of some kind of rape occurring is very likely due to the fact that there's over a billion people there. so this could be a matter of shitty people manipulating statistics in that you can promote any stereotypes when you have a population of over 1 billion. western people are desperately trying to keep the brainwashed female population convinced that the western world is treating females better than the eastern world. when you can never take away the fact that there are far more females in asia who have spent 9 months of their lives bringing a baby to term.

most european workers who come to america via europe are going to be high level executive types. or people who are paid to come here and primarily interact with high level executives. so they see with their own eyes the lack of diversity.

They are the only demographic of females who marries out more than they marry into their group. Their experiences are probably more in line with the experiences with that of a native american female. But in america most minority children are isolated from their peers and as a result their views are largely defined by the stereotypes of the people around them.

BUT BUT BUT ALL THOSE ASIAN STEREOTYPES! DEY GOTTA BE TRUE! No, people like those implicated in the #metoo movement perpetuated the stereotypes because they knew what would happen if females actually found out the truth.

this is not the first time hollywood starlets were enamored by an asian man. Sessue was only second to charlie chaplin when it came to pay. And charlie was only there for comedic relief while Sessue was hired for his looks and demeanor.

>When Sessue was getting out of his limousine in front of a theater of a  premiere showing, he grimaced a little because there was a puddle. Then,  dozens of female fans surrounding his car fell over one another to  spread their fur coats at his feet

There were a lot of injured stuntmen from the taping of the ""green hornet"" show, to the point where they couldn't find any people willing or people even healthy enough to do the stunts. gene was one of the few stunt men in hollywood who actually trained in the martial arts and competed professionally in the field. Plus he was a huge man who probably had 50 pounds on bruce along with being half a foot taller. gene putting bruce in a hold and carrying him around was probably to soften bruce up and to make sure that bruce knew that he's not going to be a push over. Gene and bruce probably revolutionized the notion of what a stuntman is in hollywood. learning martial arts became a standard for the field.

most people from europe do not go around telling people that they are european. they tell people they are british, french, italiian, etc. the term european to them is too broad of a term. it really should be used sparingly. can you imagine a person building an identity solely on being european american? what would be their traditional clothing be like? what language would they speak?

obviously those whose ancestors came from africa a long time ago to the americas may have lost their connection to their culture and ethnic/racial groups. so them using the term african is an attempt to regain that cultural and ethnic identity. the term african to them is like the term nigerian to op.

what op should be writing is that people in america who goes by the term african american, should find out where in africa they are from.
