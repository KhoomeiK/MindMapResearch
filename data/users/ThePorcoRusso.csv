Art,fffop74,t1_fff80b3,1579888487.0,"I wish that weren’t the case. The pose OP is in is great for figure sketching and isn’t meant to be sexual, but some think with the wrong head I guess

There’s also something about drawing women that appeals to me more than drawing men. Again, not sexual; I compare it to preferring to draw one kind of landscape over another. Something about a woman’s hair and face make those features fun to draw

reddeadredemption,ffeju45,t1_ffejjo5,1579850990.0,I once got lassoed by a dude and fucked with because he was talking to me and I didn’t have a mic so he got annoyed when I eventually left to continue my hunting
Whatcouldgowrong,ffdrh2u,t1_ffcuy9p,1579827124.0,"A pellet gun can still really hurt someone, especially when it hits their face/head. I feel like they should know how to handle that gun as if it were shooting live ammunition (sounds extreme, but so too does blinding someone because you held a pellet gun the wrong way at a carnival)

That employee needs to be reprimanded or fired and customers need to be given basic instructions on handling a pellet gun (like: don’t shoot it if someone is in front of you!)"
Chodi,ff9oghm,t1_ff9e2of,1579717279.0,Well shit if there’s a one way scientific expedition out of Earth then sign me up
todayilearned,ff9o70b,t1_ff9nqy8,1579717107.0,"Idk in retrospect my points do seem weak. I guess I just want more solid proof, something we don’t really have for the time being. Maybe in the near future? I’d be excited if so.

In any case I, for one, welcome our new alien overlords lol"
todayilearned,ff9maao,t1_ff9lezv,1579715971.0,"I can’t say anything about the 70+ years part but the trend of military technological developments being hidden from the public until they’ve become outdated/ fully deployed is a trend for sure. It makes sense too that they would maintain a PR blackout about such things as that would confuse foreign intelligence and leave them unaware of the true nature of the phenomena. The F117, SR71 and B2 are great examples of this

As for the Fermi Paradox, again I’m not saying extraterrestrial life doesn’t exist. It’s just that the odds that they live near enough to us that they know us, can visit us, and have visited us with a frequency even close to the number of reported UFO sightings are nigh improbable considering possible factors like the Great Filter or even just the size of the universe"

Chodi,ff9dacq,t1_ff9ck3w,1579710477.0,"I guess the same could be said for men too, with the whole patriarchy thing and all that. But then that leaves us at an impasse. Can we truly have equality in any society?"
Chodi,ff9c7qw,t1_ff8odl8,1579709669.0,"This isn’t feminism, this is straight discrimination

Feminism believes in equality between the 2 sexes so in this case, both men and women could carry knives lmao"
todayilearned,ff9boh0,t1_ff8fses,1579709297.0,"It didn’t have to be a UFO to warrant that reaction. Even secret military prototypes would best be kept covered up

AskMen,ff8f862,t1_ff4fekp,1579675910.0,"I mean self deprecating humour can mean other things too, for example your ability to look at yourself and identify aspects about your body or personality or upbringing or whatever that could use work or are just worth joking about. It’s a great way to talk about a concept while adding a layer of legitimacy since it is your own experience 

In any case OP should just thank her and move on lmao"

Indians were viewed as commodities, not people. He wanted to keep them fed so they could keep providing manpower

For the good stuff Churchill did and said, there’s also a darker side to him when it comes to India, as with most British government officials back then really,"
