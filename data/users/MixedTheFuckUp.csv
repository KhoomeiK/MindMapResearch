bipolar2,ffpedfn,t3_euhfg3,1580092951.0,"I don't think it was in the DSM until the 90s and there was definitely not a spectrum paradigm of Bipolar. Since, it is regularly missed and misdiagnosed as MDD even today, my guess would be most definitely!"

bipolar2,ffp9eos,t3_eud23t,1580089457.0,"I'd be interested but all I could find was something called ""family-to-family"". If you don't mind, I'd like to PM you for more info."
BipolarReddit,ffp8q72,t1_ffp6q2g,1580088999.0,"Yes, and he is really not a bad guy but he actually screams at people in group and acts out a little bit. I think I got something in my email about an online training for facilitators from DBSA last week. A a little variety in the facilitator department would make all the difference in the world."
BipolarReddit,ffp8c6e,t1_ffo9hjd,1580088745.0,"I'm sorry. When I've been in a similar state, I try to take it one minute or hour at a time because one day is too much."
BipolarReddit,ffn9nuy,t3_euah2y,1580063484.0,It's just a bump in the road. The Valium is. You are probably self-medicating. Your suicidal ideation should not be ignored though. Reach out to your psychiatrist and support system.
bipolar_irl,ffn7snb,t3_erc6su,1580062913.0,"Yes!! Eating dinner a couple of weeks ago, I thought ""Why are you still alive? Kill yourself"" and then it passed. I figure it's coping strategy that I find to be a good option when in a mixed state and even once I'm not in a mixed state anymore, my mind is just used to going there and taking that path."
BipolarReddit,ffn0n48,t1_ffmzi9d,1580060752.0,"Don't be scared! I think it's a good thing. Unfortunately, I was in a mixed stated and the agitation from the facilitator was aggrevating my agitation. I was so irritable that when the depressives spoke, I didn't give a fuck about their unipolar shit and when the schizoaffectives shared their paranoid delusions, I was irritated by that too. LOL!! But I also met people there who were just like me. They were my people and they had words of wisdom for me that really helped."
BipolarReddit,ffmyz1z,t3_eu9px0,1580060318.0,"I've been and found some comfort being around others with the same dx. On the other hand, the facilitator was so damn agitated every single time that I stopped going. Oh, they joy of being Bipolar and then being around others who are also Bipolar and manifesting symptoms!"
bipolar2,ffmxxht,t3_eu8t7f,1580060057.0,"OMG, I so relate to your post that it brought me joy. I love the ""Being Bipolar sucks even when you're not Bipolar""!!! LOL! I think many of us have experienced similar situations to yours. You are absolutely right in that they can't make up their fucking minds and it is dx fuckery!! So, just thank you for sharing. Thank you for your wit! I am actually hoping a millstone does not crush you!"
rtms,ffmh1qk,t1_ffmcs70,1580054591.0,Wishing you the best. Mental illness is fucking brutal.
rtms,ffmbcuc,t1_ffmardx,1580051779.0,"Right! Definitely bring it up with the doctor. I got theta burst which I think is also deep on the left side and then I got like three minutes on the right side for anxiety. I'm not sure how precise any of it is but it is my understanding that you should not be twitching. Also, if it's any consolation, I had a very bumpy ride that was mostly in a positive direction but there is the ""dip"" and I wasn't always convinced I was getting better."
bipolar,ffm8jm2,t1_ffm7thp,1580050364.0,"If you already took your Zoloft this morning, I would think you could take your Abilify whenever you want. Is there some reason your doctor wants you taking the Zoloft at night and Abilify in the morning? For example, Zoloft makes you sleepy and Abilify keeps you up? Is your dr available via email on the weekends? Maybe email him or her."
bipolar,ffm7jy5,t3_eu7frp,1580049805.0,"I wouldn't worry. In fact, I find it unusual that you take the Abilify that can cause drowsiness in the morning and the Zoloft at night."
rtms,ffm61q0,t3_eu5nbz,1580049184.0,"Yikes! My techs all used a measuring tape every single time after placing my cap on my head to make sure that it was exactly where it was supposed to be--not that I would have known otherwise--and I only had twitching during my first calebration session with the doctor. I would be concerned if I were you. It sounds like you brought it up but was the doctor present or did you just bring it up with the techs? Considering the cost and what is at stake, I might consider switching to a different clinic."
bipolar,ffjuuju,t1_ffjsu7h,1580007579.0,"Yep! I thought they were going to switch me up to BD I too! The lesson I've learned is that anything--expcept likely ECT--that can treat depression in an average person, can and will fuck me up."
bipolar,ffjsa9h,t1_ffjpft5,1580005582.0,Nothing really offends me except what you see above. Do not fucking blame my mental illness if I disgree with you and/or you don't like the way I'm behaving.
bipolar,ffjrudo,t1_ffjqsb7,1580005247.0,I had a great--read maybe too great--response when I was first put on it. I loved it! Then I experienced severe agitation and irritability which my doctor tried to tell me might be due to the Wellbutrin. It wasn't until the neverending mixed episode from hell that I agreed to stopped taking it.
bipolar,ffjrm6a,t3_etz5j3,1580005094.0,Check out [psycheducation.org](https://psycheducation.org). I have never had full blown euphoric mania but mania can manifest if many different ways. More and more doctors are understanding that this is a spectrum disorder.
BipolarReddit,ffjr7sy,t3_eu0014,1580004827.0,"I feel ya! I've been seeing my psychiatrist for well over 10 years and during my last mixed episode I started crying at the thought of him retiring. He told me that he had no plans to retire any time soon. I pay out of pocket to see him because every single time I try to see someone covered by my insurance, I am deeply disappointed at their lack of knowledge of their own damn subject and even their lack of empathy."
BipolarReddit,ffj0jg2,t1_ffimctm,1579987330.0,"Hopefully, you have a skilled psychiatrist doing the diagnosing. I'm only a licensed clinical social worker and can tecchnically diagnose in my country but would not diagnose myself and am lucky enough to have found a doctor I really trust and have been seeing for over 10 years. I've been working as such for over 20 years and feel like if even I can differentaite betweeen BD of any kind and BPD--although if a client has both, that is a whole other ball of wax--certainly medical practitioners should be able to do so and are not meeting their duty of care, if they do not take the time and energy to properly diagnose before putting a patient on psychotropic meds for over 10 years. Feels very sloppy to me and assuming the patient has been truthfully reporting his or her signs and symptoms, this should not happen."
BipolarReddit,ffiie8t,t3_ettbq9,1579974597.0,"I think a good way to differentiate is that one is physical and one is characterlogical. WIth Bipolar disorder, you can see episodes that are triggered by events but the episodes are very physical and are not necessarily triggered by events. There is often a disruption in sleep, energy and appetite as well as other physical symptoms like increased heart rate and blood pressure during mania and psychomotor agitation. BPD always manifests in response to events--real or preceived. Bipolar will respond to some extent to sleep hygiene and exercise but BPD does not and the only widely accepted treatment is DBT. Those with Bipolar are more likely to complete suicide or attempt to because they want to escape the intense pain whereas, those with BPD often do it as a ""cry for help"" and their suicide attempts are often less likely to be fatal. Bipolar epsisodes can come out of nowhere and the person with Bipolar may attribute the episode to an event but is less likely to blame a person. Those with BPD typically split (see a person as good one day and then all bad another) and typically attribute blame to others for all of their perceived problems.

I see this question so often on this subreddit and it is so disheartening because no one should be on the heavy duty psych meds those of us with Bipolar take when there is zero evidence to support their use in those with personality disorders. I also don't think that it is that difficult to differentiate between the two and find it very concerning that there are so many poorly trained clinicians out there.

I can only imagine how frustrated you must be and wish you the best of luck in finding the answers you need.

Edit: I have to add that the differences are even more pronounced between BD I and BPD. Any clinician who can't distinguish between full-blown mania and BPD, should lose his or her license."
bipolar2,ffi5rf3,t3_etj4nh,1579965819.0,"I've been a vegetarian a little longer and have gone vegan multiple times over the years as it is always my goal. If anything, it helped with some weight loss while on antipsychotics but can't say it ever contributed to any kind of episode that I know of. I also take B12 and D3. I only started the D3 because my dr said mine was low and put me on prescription strength for a couple of months and then told me to buy otc. Please keep us posted here on how you're doing and I'm sorry that your experiencing an episode."

bipolar2,fffdjx3,t1_ffei4a9,1579881598.0,"Mine doesn't respond to meds anymore. So, I'm not sure how treatable Bipolar is for everyone. I was referred for ECT and about to start when I got approved for TMS. It helped a lot but I've learned over the years that what might work for me one year, might not another. One of my friends is only 40 and been through two rounds of ECT and one of TMS and obviously every med combo and nothing is working. So, I  wouldn't presume to say she doesn't have the same right to death with dignity someone else does."

BipolarReddit,ffe2rte,t1_ffe2l0b,1579835195.0,"Yes!! After being on meds like Depakote and Seroquel which cause a ton of weight gain, it is really hard to not appreciate some loss of appetite--especially when it isn't coming from a depressive state."
BipolarReddit,ffe2h9v,t1_ffe2d9a,1579834978.0,"Yes, yes and yes! I've experienced it. I usually like it and refuse to see it as a concern but it should be viewed as one."
rtms,ffe29qb,t1_ffe22k0,1579834823.0,"Oh, thanks. It sounds like it's not working for you then. Personally, I believe MDD has at least a genetic predisposition. It may have never manifested without the trauma; it could have been dormant."

BipolarReddit,ffdx6uo,t1_ffdkbya,1579831153.0,"Yeah, I know what you mean. Today at work a colleague referred to someone as ""psychotic"" no less than five times when in fact,  none of this person's behavior is indicative of psychosis. She was just using it as a way to say the person is a liar. People misuse psychiatric terms all too often."
BipolarReddit,ffdwttn,t3_et38jj,1579830893.0,"Do it when and if you feel comfortable. My  mother has no understanding of mental illness. So, I did not share my dx with her for years. When I did tell, her she didn't know what it meant anyway. Also, I'm 50 and have seen so many doctors and not all of them agree. Some say I am Bipolar II and some say MDD with mixed features. The doctors who have seen my manic responses to SSRIs and TMS are more inclinded to say I'm Bipolar. The DSM is always evolving. It may be more important to let your mom know how she can support you."

BipolarReddit,ffdio25,t1_ffdhujr,1579821682.0,"100% agree with this. We are taught to use people first language these days but never assume you speak for someone else. Personally, I am Bipolar.  It doesn't even matter if I'm currently experiencing symptoms that are stereotypical of manic, depressive or mixed states. It's like alcoholism for me. I am always struggling with it and must always be aware of it even if I'm in remission or recovery."
bipolar,ffclbxw,t3_eso3x7,1579801896.0,"I'm sorry but I wouldn't take advice from a dr. who had to look up the med. Plus, she may have just gotten that info from the manufacturer of the med. It sounds like your psychiatrist is being more honest and definitely knows more about psych meds. My psychiatrist is always up to date on all the peer reviewed journal articles on my meds. He is always able to tell me about side-effects not mentioned online."
bipolar,ffayeeo,t1_ffay47o,1579747368.0,"Oh, I've done that too. I had a couple of amazing rolls and then went into a mixed episode for eight months. I've wondered if the MDMA is what caused the episode. So, I've been staying away from it but I feel ya!"
bipolar,ffay7gd,t1_ffaxzd1,1579747241.0,Interesting. My doctor talks more about my anxiety than I do. Maybe I'm perceiving it differently.
bipolar,ffay164,t1_ffaxsr1,1579747128.0,Right!?
bipolar,ffaxxtd,t3_eskreo,1579747065.0,"Yeah, that sounds like my mixed episodes. Tell your psychiatrist and take it very seriously. Mixed episodes are the most dangerous for us as we are most likely to kill ourselves in one because they are so fucking miserable."

My heart goes out to you and I wish you the best. I am actually scheduled to start a master's in Deaf education program this summer because I cannot handle the stress and politics of my social work job anymore. I'm licensed and have had my master's for almost 20 years. I chose Deaf Ed because I have a friend who does it as an itinerant and she said it is rewarding and there is very little stress.

bipolar,ffavyxt,t3_esjsr9,1579745758.0,"BD and GAD are very common comorbid. My pdoc gives me the GAD inventory everytime I see him. There is a lot of overlap with anxiety and dysphoric manic symptoms like agitation, racing thoughts and irritability."

bipolar,ff7o5jv,t3_eryqoi,1579654244.0,"I experienced that during my last mixed episode. I'm not sure how much of it was the episode itself, the massive amounts of Seroquel or my low sodium from Tegretal. It was terrifying! I have a master's degree and job that requires me to have some cognitive function. I'm sorry you're suffering through this. Mine did pass but very, very slowly. I started to be able to read and process information. I still struggle with peer-reviewed journal articles but I am hoping I will continue to recover."
bipolar2,ff7mwku,t3_erzk3c,1579653366.0,"I completely empathize. I never had children but I really appreciate your post. I fucking hate those kinds of speakers. Honestly, I'm totally annoyed by anyone who loves life. Thanks for sharing Hunter S. Thompson's suicide note. I never knew that he wrote that! I so get it. As my dearest friend who is also Bipolar always says, life is hard for us."
BipolarReddit,ff7m28f,t3_ery7s1,1579652788.0,I was on that for many years. Wellbutrin to treat the depression and Seroqel to calm me down and ease the agitation and irritability.

TherapeuticKetamine,ff6iome,t1_ff4x0or,1579628033.0,"As a licensed therapist, I can say therapists don't know a whole lot. I've been one for almost 20 years and about 80% don't even have a good grasp on Bipolar. Even my regular psychiatrist wasn't sure about the TMS. He wanted me to do ECT. My TMS dr was amazing.  She adjusted the protocol for my Bipolar because the first session made me manic."
bipolar,ff6hxwz,t1_ff3wpxg,1579627581.0,"Specifically, Xanax. Lots of it, though. Up to 4mg a day."
bipolar,ff3v5vj,t1_ff3pl0m,1579549542.0,"For me, about an hour. Two at the most."
bipolar,ff3ksnm,t3_erghua,1579543160.0,"When not in a manic state, I would never ever take it during the day and 25mg would knock me out for 12 hours. When in a manic state, I can take 800mg and it does hardly anything. Agree with the poster and you about your dr prescribing it for daytime use as very odd. It can be super sedating."
bipolar,ff3kfd3,t3_ergl3c,1579542937.0,No but it doesn't help.
bipolar2,ff3k808,t1_ff3i47k,1579542813.0,"Obviously, I'm not your doctor but keeping someone on Prozac during a mixed episode seems like a really bad idea. Prozac is what caused my first mixed episode. I'm sure your instinct about it causing anxiety is correct. How long have you been on it?"
bipolar,ff3jy6m,t1_ff3hewe,1579542646.0,"Didn't work. Neither did Triliptal and Tegretol lowered my sodium so much, it made me ill."

bipolar,ff3jodv,t1_ff3gram,1579542482.0,Totally!! So many roadblocks when we just want to be stable.
bipolar,ff3gwum,t3_ere6ut,1579540788.0,"That is total BS!! My Bipolar doesn't respond to much anymore.  After being diagnosed with TRD and having a manic response to all of the SSRIs a nurse said, "" Well at least if you're Bipolar, it's easily treated with lithium"" . That bitch was dead wrong."
bipolar2,ff3gcta,t3_erg33c,1579540475.0,"All I want to do is die and Seroquel can help sedate me for the first week or but if it lasts longer, nothing works. It is incredibly painful. I often wished I could exchange it for cancer or ALS. That's how awful it was."

TherapeuticKetamine,ff3eiaf,t1_ff3awlo,1579539442.0,"Oh, I'm sorry. Mine works like that too and only my first infusion gave me any relief by turning it from active SI to passive. I should note that I'm Bipolar. So I have a whole other level of crazy going on. What has helped is the intranasal ketamine my ketamine dr prescribed. Not so much with the SI but stopping my racing thoughts. Also, TMS was a godsend. That is what actually got me stable."

bipolar,ff38ft1,t3_erch0x,1579536150.0,I can work my way up to 800mg a day of Seroquel and still have hardly any sleep during an episode. Benzos help when I'm not in the middle of a severe episode but nothing seems to work when I am. I'm sorry you're experiencing this. It is fucking horrific. I want nothing more than a good night's sleep in life and it is hard. Working out as much as I can and using amber goggles at night helps even during a horrible episode.

BTW, I completed a round of TMS in October and I feel like it saved my life. I don't have any memory issues or other cognitive deficits from it but I do have issues from the severe mixed episode I was in for eight months before I got it. When I told my psychiatrist, ""There go 15 IQ points I'll never see again"" he smiled knowingly. If it's not the illness, it's the treatment. Anyway, wishing you the best of luck with that.

BipolarReddit,few3pja,t1_few3hl9,1579404908.0,I'm so sorry. Mixed episodes are the worst. Scary and dangerous. Take care of yourself and let your psychiatrist know what is going on.

I was referred for ECT and about to start when I got approved for TMS. It helped a lot but I've learned over the years that what might work for me one year, might not another. One of my friends is only 40 and been through two rounds of ECT and one of TMS and obviously every med combo and nothing is working.

I'm not saying that I haven't had some pleasant hypomania over the years but to say that to me while I was in a months long mixed episode and more suicidal than I'd ever been in my life, disgusted me and I realized that she was not someone I wanted to be in contact with at the time. We are back to speaking but my point is that people are ignorant and can and will use it against you. I have never not taken my prescribed meds and never not had a psychiatrist.

You would still be able to be a teacher and you might even get paid more and have more opportubities. So, all is not lost. Be gentle with yourself as you recover and learn about your illness and how to manage it."

bipolar,fe8hwzx,t3_eo16q2,1578926354.0,"I've never understood the ""swing"" part and find that a really inappropriate term to describe what I experience. Swing makes it sound like it's a smooth ride and consistently flowing from one to the other. It's not even a roller coaster for me. Mixed episodes are my most worst episodes and there is no children's ride to describe that shit!"
bipolar,fe6ffzx,t1_fe68avg,1578889292.0,Sounds good.

bipolar,fe65ccu,t3_enxm7t,1578882134.0,I am!! I am happy to say that these horrible genes end with me and I will never be responsible for another person having to live with this illness.
bipolar,fe651mq,t1_fe5ygpq,1578881943.0,Suicidal ideation is scary for everyone. I can't speak for your SO or you but maybe try to reframe so that it's the thought of losing you that he hates and not the behavior. We can't control our SI. Our loved ones need to listen to us and be open to hearing about it because it means we need help and are in a lot of pain. Don't ever keep it to yourself. Always share those thoughts with those you trust.
bipolar,fe5y7du,t3_enwk3y,1578877583.0,I totally relate. Just remember that people who do not have this disorder not only don't understand it but may be afraid of it. In long term relationships my SO gets to see me in various episodes and that is really how they learn about it.
