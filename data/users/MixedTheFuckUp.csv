bipolar2,fffdjx3,t1_ffei4a9,1579881598.0,"Mine doesn't respond to meds anymore. So, I'm not sure how treatable Bipolar is for everyone. I was referred for ECT and about to start when I got approved for TMS. It helped a lot but I've learned over the years that what might work for me one year, might not another. One of my friends is only 40 and been through two rounds of ECT and one of TMS and obviously every med combo and nothing is working. So, I  wouldn't presume to say she doesn't have the same right to death with dignity someone else does."

BipolarReddit,ffdx6uo,t1_ffdkbya,1579831153.0,"Yeah, I know what you mean. Today at work a colleague referred to someone as ""psychotic"" no less than five times when in fact,  none of this person's behavior is indicative of psychosis. She was just using it as a way to say the person is a liar. People misuse psychiatric terms all too often."
BipolarReddit,ffdwttn,t3_et38jj,1579830893.0,"Do it when and if you feel comfortable. My  mother has no understanding of mental illness. So, I did not share my dx with her for years. When I did tell, her she didn't know what it meant anyway. Also, I'm 50 and have seen so many doctors and not all of them agree. Some say I am Bipolar II and some say MDD with mixed features. The doctors who have seen my manic responses to SSRIs and TMS are more inclinded to say I'm Bipolar. The DSM is always evolving. It may be more important to let your mom know how she can support you."

BipolarReddit,ffdio25,t1_ffdhujr,1579821682.0,"100% agree with this. We are taught to use people first language these days but never assume you speak for someone else. Personally, I am Bipolar.  It doesn't even matter if I'm currently experiencing symptoms that are stereotypical of manic, depressive or mixed states. It's like alcoholism for me. I am always struggling with it and must always be aware of it even if I'm in remission or recovery."
bipolar,ffclbxw,t3_eso3x7,1579801896.0,"I'm sorry but I wouldn't take advice from a dr. who had to look up the med. Plus, she may have just gotten that info from the manufacturer of the med. It sounds like your psychiatrist is being more honest and definitely knows more about psych meds. My psychiatrist is always up to date on all the peer reviewed journal articles on my meds. He is always able to tell me about side-effects not mentioned online."

bipolar,ffaxxtd,t3_eskreo,1579747065.0,"Yeah, that sounds like my mixed episodes. Tell your psychiatrist and take it very seriously. Mixed episodes are the most dangerous for us as we are most likely to kill ourselves in one because they are so fucking miserable."

I am actually scheduled to start a master's in Deaf education program this summer because I cannot handle the stress and politics of my social work job anymore. I'm licensed and have had my master's for almost 20 years. I chose Deaf Ed because I have a friend who does it as an itinerant and she said it is rewarding and there is very little stress.

I'm not sure how much of it was the episode itself, the massive amounts of Seroquel or my low sodium from Tegretal. It was terrifying! I have a master's degree and job that requires me to have some cognitive function. I'm sorry you're suffering through this. Mine did pass but very, very slowly. I started to be able to read and process information. I still struggle with peer-reviewed journal articles but I am hoping I will continue to recover."

I've been one for almost 20 years and about 80% don't even have a good grasp on Bipolar. Even my regular psychiatrist wasn't sure about the TMS. He wanted me to do ECT. My TMS dr was amazing.  She adjusted the protocol for my Bipolar because the first session made me manic."

bipolar,ff3ksnm,t3_erghua,1579543160.0,"When not in a manic state, I would never ever take it during the day and 25mg would knock me out for 12 hours. When in a manic state, I can take 800mg and it does hardly anything. Agree with the poster and you about your dr prescribing it for daytime use as very odd. It can be super sedating."
bipolar,ff3kfd3,t3_ergl3c,1579542937.0,No but it doesn't help.
bipolar2,ff3k808,t1_ff3i47k,1579542813.0,"Obviously, I'm not your doctor but keeping someone on Prozac during a mixed episode seems like a really bad idea. Prozac is what caused my first mixed episode. I'm sure your instinct about it causing anxiety is correct. How long have you been on it?"
bipolar,ff3jy6m,t1_ff3hewe,1579542646.0,"Didn't work. Neither did Triliptal and Tegretol lowered my sodium so much, it made me ill."

bipolar,ff3jodv,t1_ff3gram,1579542482.0,Totally!! So many roadblocks when we just want to be stable.
bipolar,ff3gwum,t3_ere6ut,1579540788.0,"That is total BS!! My Bipolar doesn't respond to much anymore.  After being diagnosed with TRD and having a manic response to all of the SSRIs a nurse said, "" Well at least if you're Bipolar, it's easily treated with lithium"" . That bitch was dead wrong."
bipolar2,ff3gcta,t3_erg33c,1579540475.0,"All I want to do is die and Seroquel can help sedate me for the first week or but if it lasts longer, nothing works. It is incredibly painful. I often wished I could exchange it for cancer or ALS. That's how awful it was."

TherapeuticKetamine,ff3eiaf,t1_ff3awlo,1579539442.0,"Oh, I'm sorry. Mine works like that too and only my first infusion gave me any relief by turning it from active SI to passive. I should note that I'm Bipolar. So I have a whole other level of crazy going on. What has helped is the intranasal ketamine my ketamine dr prescribed. Not so much with the SI but stopping my racing thoughts. Also, TMS was a godsend. That is what actually got me stable."
bipolar,ff3au6t,t1_ff3amyk,1579537588.0,"They've helped me with that too. Not when I'm in a severe episode but coming out of it, they've definitely helped."
bipolar,ff39b95,t3_er9c3p,1579536725.0,Not sure about pupil size but my primary care was convinced I had hyperthyroidism because my eyes were bugged out. Tested my thyroid and I was hypo! When I was at a Bipolar support group I saw a guy with his eyes all bugged out and realized it's probably not an uncommon look during an episode.

bipolar,ff38ft1,t3_erch0x,1579536150.0,I can work my way up to 800mg a day of Seroquel and still have hardly any sleep during an episode. Benzos help when I'm not in the middle of a severe episode but nothing seems to work when I am. I'm sorry you're experiencing this. It is fucking horrific. I want nothing more than a good night's sleep in life and it is hard. Working out as much as I can and using amber goggles at night helps even during a horrible episode.
bipolar,ff37wox,t3_er6yok,1579535798.0,"If you don't have sleep or energy changes that are severe and you're splitting, it's probably BPD and not BD."
TherapeuticKetamine,ff37h7t,t3_er67k6,1579535514.0,My suicidal ideation lingers long after an episode. I believe it becomes a habit to think about and it doesn't just go away. I've been fairly stable for three months and still think about it.
BipolarReddit,ff372js,t3_erbaxd,1579535238.0,"Over the years, I've been on every mood stabilizer and most of the other usual Bipolar meds and I either experience a side-effect that results in having to stop or they don't do anything for me. (The antipsychotics usually sedate me until I become tolerant during an episode and then nothing calms me down). My psychiatrist referred me for TMS and ECT. Ended up responding to a very modified TMS protocol that has enabled me to function again."
bipolar,ff31npq,t1_ff2vg5n,1579531315.0,"I will detinitey check that out!

BTW, I completed a round of TMS in October and I feel like it saved my life. I don't have any memory issues or other cognitive deficits from it but I do have issues from the severe mixed episode I was in for eight months before I got it. When I told my psychiatrist, ""There go 15 IQ points I'll never see again"" he smiled knowingly. If it's not the illness, it's the treatment. Anyway, wishing you the best of luck with that. My TMS protocol and meds had to be adjusted quite a lot as it was very ""activiating"" for me--in other words, made me more manic."
bipolar,ff1ivhc,t3_er44nm,1579479918.0,It is. A lot of people are going to warn you about the evils of benzodizapines but they've been incredibly helpful to me.

bipolar,feyqbpw,t3_eqxryl,1579449260.0,"I believe it is genetic. As time passes, more and more research comes out always indicating that even our personality traits are genetic. Of course. lifestyle, drugs (including those damen SSRIs) and trauma can trigger episodes but I think they only trigger what was just beneath the surface."

BipolarReddit,few3pja,t1_few3hl9,1579404908.0,I'm so sorry. Mixed episodes are the worst. Scary and dangerous. Take care of yourself and let your psychiatrist know what is going on.

bipolar,fevdfko,t3_eqo8vr,1579396112.0,Another Seroquel user here. It's been at least 10 years but I only used it as needed. During severe episodes I take up to 800mg a day to sleep.

socialwork,fet0que,t1_fesxjhc,1579370782.0,"Yeah, I can see where that would be murky. I am a salaried employee and have been sent to many conferences paid for by work but I still always get a ""duty-free lunch"" and if I spend it with co-workers, that would be my choice. I can't imagine reporting back to a supervisor anything said at lunch but that is just not my style. If I take issue with something someone says, I tend to either let it go and not associate with that person in my off time or say something directly to the person myself."

socialwork,fesd6kp,t1_fesbrka,1579364041.0,"I agree that if it impacts the workplace, the empoyer could say something and in this case, I believe a conversation would have been appropriate but not a write-up. You really can't compare this to having sex with a subortinate or intaking any substance during lunch that could impact your work performance. Maybe more comprable to having sex with a colleague outside of work. Which I also think is no one's business."

During my last horrible mixed episode, one of my closest friends said so many obnoxious things to me that I had to write her a long email explaining why I was taking a break from her until I felt better. She's actually said to me ""It seems like you enjoy it sometimes and maybe you don't really want it to get better."" I'm not saying that I haven't had some pleasant hypomania over the years but to say that to me while I was in a months long mixed episode and more suicidal than I'd ever been in my life, disgusted me and I realized that she was not someone I wanted to be in contact with at the time. We are back to speaking but my point is that people are ignorant and can and will use it against you. I have never not taken my prescribed meds and never not had a psychiatrist. So, I have no tolerance for anyone who would say cruel things to me right in the middle of the worst mixed episode I'd ever experienced."

I am easily triggered by anything reminding me of them, I fear that every little bump in the road is another one coming and even flashback-like memories of them which are terrifying. I can't imagine anyone who has been through a bad episode recovers right away or isn't haunted by it. I got out of an eight month long mixed episode the end of October and am still not right.

I got a master's to work as a school social worker and was recently accepted into a different graduate program to get a special education credential to work in Dead Ed. In other words, there are all kinds of things you can do. You have a solid foundation to build on and can probably find a less stressful job with a master's in something like Deaf Ed.

I can't speak for your SO or you but maybe try to reframe so that it's the thought of losing you that he hates and not the behavior. We can't control our SI. Our loved ones need to listen to us and be open to hearing about it because it means we need help and are in a lot of pain. Don't ever keep it to yourself. Always share those thoughts with those you trust.
bipolar,fe5y7du,t3_enwk3y,1578877583.0,I totally relate. Just remember that people who do not have this disorder not only don't understand it but may be afraid of it. In long term relationships my SO gets to see me in various episodes and that is really how they learn about it.
