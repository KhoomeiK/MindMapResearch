worldnews,fdjxw7p,t1_fdjt8ss,1578490944.0,"> Maybe it's because of Haifa's large Bahai population (which the Iranian fanatics aren't a big fan of)...

You are very correct that Iranian conservative clerics persecute Baha'is in Iran. This is actually why there are so many Baha'is in Ashgabat and Southern India.

However, there are actually very few Baha'is in Haifa, or in Israel in general. Baha'is typically only travel to Israel at the invitation of the Universal House of Justice, our central religious body, and are encouraged to only live in Israel if they are serving at the Baha'i Gardens.

Heck, if an Israeli asks us about the Faith, we have to guide them to other resources. The UHJ is very serious about not influencing Israeli politics. Our prophet just happened to die as a prisoner of an  Ottoman prison city. That's largely why we're there. We predate much of the Jewish resettlement of Palestine.
