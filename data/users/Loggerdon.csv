IndianCountry,fgrp8d0,t1_fgrlw8o,1581053025.0,"You make good points. Let me address them.

UBI is not a perfect solution but I think it's the best we've got. The jobs are already going away and 30% of all jobs will probably go away in the next 10-15 years, never to return. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't WANT for there to be a UBI, I just think that it's probably unavoidable at this point. The artificial intelligence that is coming in the next few years will be WAY better than previous versions. The workforce is changing and no one is confronting the problem. We've already automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs in the last 10 years. Next will be clerical (call centers), transportation (self driving cars / trucks), retail, food service. That's 50% of the jobs in America. It's already happening. Have you seen the kiosks at MacDonalds?

Where UBI has been tried it hasn't raised inflation or prices much at all. 

If someone is already receiving gov money, some programs will be exempt, although to be honest I don't know which ones. The way welfare etc is set up you can't earn even a dollar or you lose your benefits. Not so with UBI. If there are 2 adults then $24k / year. And someone (like your brother in law) could still work and earn that money too. 

Regarding the VAT it's only on consumption, with many essentials (such as food, clothes) being exempt. How else are we gonna tax the corporations? That wealth tax had been tried in 4 European countries, including France and Germany. It failed and they abolished it. The rich people were too good at getting around the tax. 

Personally I don't believe forcing companies to pay a higher minimum wage is the answer. People work bad jobs because they don't want to starve. If people had enough money to eat and pay a little rent then the bosses would have trouble filling the terrible jobs and would be forced to raise wages or go out if business. 

I wasn't raised on a Rez but I've worked in literally hundreds of Native communities. If you had a small community of 4,000 (2000 adults), then it would mean an extra $24 million in the economy every year. How could that be bad?

Most big corporations pay zero in Federal taxes. Is that fair?"

AskReddit,fgoqn14,t1_fgoqgty,1580981805.0,"Once the tumor is large enough to see, you have had cancer for a very long time:

""The natural history of the growth of Steve Jobs’ pancreatic cancer can be determined by mathematical calculations. The interval between his diagnosis at age 48 and his death at age 56 was approximately 8 years (October of 2003 and October 5, 2011). From these dates it can be determined that the tumor mass in his pancreas doubled in size every 10 months. (Commonly, solid tumors of various organs double in size every 3 to 9 months.) His was a very slow growing tumor.

By knowing this stable rate of doubling (every 10 months), the date when Jobs’ cancer began can be calculated. His cancer started when he was a young adult, possibly as young as 24 years old. Similar calculations show that his cancer spread from his pancreas to his liver (and other parts of his body) more than two decades before his surgery on July 31, 2004. (Exact methods for doing these calculations are found at the end of this article.)"""
