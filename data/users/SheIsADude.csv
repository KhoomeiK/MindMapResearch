His first gig was to build a program for the school that could create correct schedules for the students since the school merged the boys school and the girls school. He didn’t do it all alone though. He did it together with Paul Allen who had a bit more experience with the computer. The school project was how he and Paul got known in the Washington area and got more gigs, since cheap capable programmers were still rare. There is a documentary on Netflix where they interview Bill about his early life and the foundation."

funny,fdkj17h,t1_fdk4ib3,1578504767.0,Phones are only 100% guaranteed waterproof the day you bought it. A lot of phone makers use glue to waterproof their phones and glue tends to break down or crack after a while. And even when gaskets are used if you’ve dropped your phone there is a chance that the gasket isn’t sealed correctly anymore. And even pocket debris can compromise the seal.
