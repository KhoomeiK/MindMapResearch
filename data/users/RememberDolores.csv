bipolar,ffik645,t1_ffiguqw,1579975816.0,"It's ok. They should be sensitive to these spiritual/new age type/philosophical ways of thinking as long as they serve us and we reconcile them in healthy, metaphorical ways and don't get carried away. For instance energy work is a part of yoga and meditation.  Totally healthy. Thinking you're an earth witch who can tap into earth's consciousness by leaning against a tree and feeling the roots electromagnetic network as if it was telepathically charging you with ineffable information and healing may earn a dose increase or involuntary admission lol. They're working off check lists, they don't know better since the DSM is their bible. Psychiatry is an nascent science still and they're still relying on blind trial and error. It's dangerous. And they're so tight on time in each appt because they're squeezing so many ppl in on top of three month wait lists. All of which is exacerbated by the significant shortage of qualified psychiatrists per patient population. 

Sooooooo.... I think a marriage of eastern philosophical and metaphysical understanding with our very materialistic, physical biological psychiatry will be the key. Often times the meds are a cast that isnt meant to stay forever and can actually prevent physical improvement. If the cast is always on you'll never get to work those muscles or exercise those bones and cartilage. It can stunt healing more than help. Or worse, the labeling and belief this is chronic and manageable only with insane side effect inducing medications is only going to lock us into square pegs when we are much more fluid than that. 

I'm 30 and learning as much as I can and keeping myself in check. But still, I wont deny after all this, my stable, educated and skeptical brain still embraces the idea that the Saturn return and big white spot storm have influence over us, just as the moon does. And I have SCIENTIFIC studies for the latter. So idk. You're growing and parenting a new ego post self realization and it's time for the work. The rebuilding schemes and a health sense of self and futurity. I felt the same. But lost at first. Now I'm beginning to see it as an opportunity long overdue.

We just have to respect we will forever live with one foot in the water, keeping ourselves from diving in headfirst but also remembering the water (emotional experience) nurtures us. If we always kept both feet on the ground, we risk depression and feeling disconnected from ourselves... part of the macrocosm that is earth. One big humming interconnected web of energy and consciousness and matter. We were never separate.

changemyview,ff46dc1,t1_ff45zqm,1579556527.0,"Yeah that I would agree isn't ok.  I thought extra breaks OP referred to would include a single break before and after lunch.as a manager I'd always allow a ten to whomever for whatever. A call, a snack, a step into sunlight, a sit down, etc.

All I'd ask when it was customer service was to go when reasonably lower volume moments came around and always to ask me first so 1. I'd know this where they went and when and 2. So I could confirm it was a convenient time for the business

Edit: I reread OP post and could see how they meant outside of the 10 commonly allowed and I def think the employer can always discriminate that. Maybe allowing it on special occasion or super dead times or during peak stress in the employee but def should never be expected to allow it regularly."
changemyview,ff41p5r,t1_ff418ta,1579553620.0,"Yeah assuming the standard 10 is allowed every 4 to 5 hrs before and after lunch in the type of work it's reasonable. And if not, there IS the lunch where they can have a smoke off the clock. 

Taking more than one 10 in those 4 to 5 hrs though  sounds like time clock abuse. As a smoker I think that's unnecessary abuse of breaks that would def be an understandable  concern for any employer. Longer shifts or shifts in fields where they'd be working in airports or on planes or in medical offices or teaching....in basically  any field where they can't leave for extended periods of time tho? Then I'd say having a nicotine patch or gum is a good idea. I'm going to be a poll worker for the elections and I have to stay in the room for all 14 hrs so I'm bringing lots of food and gonna sport a patch. Seems fair"

changemyview,ff3v48k,t1_ff3tna7,1579549515.0,"Most logical answer here.

She has an uncontrollable biological illness that is taking a toxic toll on her body, mind and, consequently, affects those around her.

However you have a choice where she doesn't.  You can consciously choose how to respond and you're choosing to remain ignorant to the nature of her illness and you justify the lack of empathy because she seems frightening and your children may be frightened should they see her. 

in order to address her illness and outburst your suggestion is to simply make her disappear. Well I have a question for you then.

What about if your child got a football related traumatic brain injury and psychosis followed and he behaved this way because of swelling in the brain (legitimate consequence and a TMI is relatively common. 

Would you suggest to the strangers who see him in a store as he panicks that they kick in his teeth and lock him up and throw away the key? 

Or if you have a daughter and she is raped and the traumatic stress triggers a psychotic break and she displays irate psychotic symptoms like this....

Should someone see her distress and verbally abuse her despite seeing full well she isn't making lucid decisions or thinking coherently and tell her to go to hell or leave before she gets her teeth kicked in? Would you like seeing a son or daughter aggressively handcuffed in public like this and dragged out like a rabid dog all while video is taken, laughs are had and internet strangers scrutinize them and even search for other videos  of them behaving this way to further propagate that material? So that's all they'll ever been seen as?

And you? If it happens to you? What's worse. Your children seeing you behave this way? Or seeing you behave this way and being responded to by being recorded as someone tells you off, kicks your teeth in, cuffs and drags you away, and then locks you up and throws away the key?

These are people. Not rabid animals. To say she shouldn't be around civilization when you're describing it as a society that would discard the ill as if they were unwanted pests tells me that the only lack of civility here lies with your reaction. 

Please reconsider your opinion of mentally ill people and keep in mind that you and your children are absolutely NOT immune to experiencing extreme mental illness, psychosis addiction and there very well may come a day that one of you will depend on the kindness of those more empathetic than you are being right now."
Whatcouldgowrong,feyff8e,t1_fey2akd,1579444791.0,"Thank you for sharing your experience. I'm sorry you went through it, it's awful and while I feel a lot better than I did two years ago when it happened and even one year ago when I was in the middle of coming to terms with it, I know there is a long way to go still. The pain of my experience is getting a little less heavy to carry every time I share it ""outloud"" and I think that's the only way we are going to be able to heal as individuals and then as a society. 

It just really sucks being one of the first but we can't start any kind of movement without someone giving that initial push. I went through this when sharing my assault experiences. I kept them secret from 11 years old until 22. Then I had a breakdown from unleashing it all at once after bottling it up too long.
Then i started sharing a little more to a few more people. Then more, and more. At this point i cant count how many people I told about my rapes who immediately said ""wow.well since you told me I actually have been through something like that but I've never told anyone else before/only told one person/etc.  And this was a couple years before #metoo. I remember thinking it was insane how many people *men too!* who I told had stories of their own. I felt less and less alone but also heartbroken that the pain I had felt, they felt too. Turned out the thing that i thought had alienated and broken me was the thing that connected me to people who also felt broken by the same kind of traumas. 

I feel like I'm seeing it all over again with mental illness. More and more media on it, positive and negative, factual sensational, etc.. but I see that as a sign that it's on it's way to becoming sort of de-tabooed. I've ended up connecting with multiple people i have known for YEARS as well as ones I've just met  who have the same mental disorder(s) and if I never spoke up (or if they didn't) then I'd have never made such close connections with people who truly understand. We both end up benefiting from that initial vulnerability in ways we couldn't have imagined. And then the fear and shame that others who DO NOT understand make us feel end up losing their power over us. 

I sincerely hope you're doing well now and continue to share your truth as well as make meaningful and supportive connections.

I had to stop crisis counseling because of the compassion fatigue but I'm glad I was able to help a few people at least"
Whatcouldgowrong,fexkg44,t1_fexj0l0,1579432432.0,"Yeah tbh I felt a twinge of pain watching it because I, a college graduate type A personality and not ""some methhead"" experienced true psychosis. The stereotypes exist because it's what media portrays the most. It can and does happen to anyone. I was only diagnosed with ptsd but extreme stress, inappropriate medication, and then the abrupt withdrawal of that medication due to lack of insurance ended up  triggering latent bipolar disorder. The initial doctor who diagnosed me years ago said he experienced psychosis once after years of helping veterans and seeing their pain coupled with a painful divorce. At the time, not knowing what psychosis really was, I was horrified. I was ignorant but eventually I learned first hand. It was horrifying but no matter how horrified someone else might have been by seeing me, I know being me was absolute unendurable hell. 

 I remember how intense and frightening the psychosis could be. Having ptsd means I'm now prone to flashbacks of childhood assault and now ALSO my own psychotic experience triggered by compounsed traumatic stress happening as a young adult. 

At times I had delusions of grandeur, others I swore I would die if I slept and when I tried I had horrible night terrors and saw shadows in my room. It is unlike anything else and her voice just chilled me to the bone. The hardest part for me to recall is deep, deep down under the psychosis symptoms I expressed, I was still in there. I think of it like the character in get out being in the sunken place. Deep within there is a part of you that knows you're no longer in control and some neurological tectonic shift is taking place but your consciousness ends up interpreting the distortion with whatever it retrieves, or knows, and for that moment you are hijacked by whatever narrative your neural pathways take you to.

It's really not a funny life to live while its absurdity may look funny or downright angering to someone not imagining how the psychotic person must be feeling to be acting that way.

This really could be you. It could be your mom. Your sister. Your teacher. Your friend. Your therapist. People like this woman are out there and they are someone's mom, sister, teacher, friend. Seeing them that way humanizes them and recognizing that is a good first step."
Whatcouldgowrong,fexi9az,t1_fexh1x9,1579431441.0,"Agreed I was inclined to laugh at some of the narrations of what was seen here but I've seen such a wide spectrum of mental illness in so many different people over the years, not excluding myself, that I've consumed an excessive amount of media and literature on abnormal psychology and I realize this is specialized and complex information about relatively rare disorders such as bipolar and schizophrenia (around 3 percent of the population) that I never would have found without specifically looking for it, for personal reasons at that. 

tbh I was delusional once and seeing this and especially seeing the comments, I am reminded of the ball of shame that sits in my stomach and the horror of losing my mind just once which is plenty of material to make you doubt yourself for the rest of your life.  

Psychosis can present in a euphoric and not dysphoric way, it can also be seemingly neutral. Subjective experiences inform the unique  manifestation of psychosis, whether drug related or otherwise, and some people act like this whereas as the other less notoriously know side of that same spectrum goes up to everyone and tells them they're a chosen one or says that they are the reincarnation of christ ...but that they are here to tell you god loves you because God told them just a moment before and that you are a chosen one, etc. The latter doesnt usually end up viral because it doesn't disturb us yet the severity may be the same. Some psychotic people will go catatonic and dit quietly and say absolutely nothing at all. The chaotic psychotic makes a neutral spectacle of themselves wearing absurd clothes and runs up to everyone in a park to tell them the trees are watching us all and there are shadow people in the sky doing experiments on us. 

I don't want to spoil making humor over serious topics. Comedy breaks ice where we would rather the topic stay frozen and laughter is a response to discomfort. But at the same time I have to be ""that girl"" and emphasize that mental illness isnt just depression and anxiety disorders. Psychosis and addiction are so misunderstood that we have to make light of it, otherwise the general population will continue to condemn or belittle and even shame those who struggle with an invisible but very real, very biological illness. One time I called my ex and screamed at him for drowning me for being a witch in a past life and I honestly believed it so fervently that it raised the hair on my neck. It was a short lived but life shattering experience that was the result of an abrupt SSNRI withdrawal. 

So idk. I could go on but I just want to implore others to become educated about all illnesses, especially mental illnesses in a time when we are having an accessibility crisis for those in need of treatment...

I tend to only wear stretchy clothes, no bra (tank with stretchy built in support under other shirts only), etc. Because I am still hyper sensitive. I have to wear ear plugs at concerts or crowded events which I generally avoid, I have a lot of trouble with auditory processing if more than one sound is in the room around the same decibel level, and I can spend days in near silence without a tv or music in the background. I am also sensitive to light and when given an option I wear a hoodie everywhere I can just because it feels like it contains my sensory periphery lol. Idk tho. I'm a mess. My resting heart rate is close to 90, I'm always inflamed and have chronic muscle tension, I'm extremely sensitive to touch and tend to recoil when touched without warning.  I'm just hypersensitive af. It's why I used to abuse drugs and drinking. Anything to dampen the intensity of everything. Without meaning to invoke any idea of being superhuman, I have to say I related to Superman in the more recent remake when he was a young Clark Kent hiding in a closet in panic when he became overwhelmed by his senses in class.

Touched by Fire by Jameson discusses the potential link with bipolar. If I'm to be honest, and this is biased, it seems to me the highest IQ scoring students  in my classes ended up turning out bipolar and/or addicted (including the two who passed away). Substance abuse and bipolar often go hand in hand. Comorbidity seems to be the norm. 

I think the closer to 130 I.Q. the gifted kids were, the better they fared. I personally believe 110 to 130 is the ideal based on my assumptions of this link between IQ and mental wellness. Bright enough to perform well without struggle but not so bright they burn out.
