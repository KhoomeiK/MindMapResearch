slowpitch,fffpk8l,t1_ffeyjmp,1579889018.0,Hope on free agent list. Join 2-3 teams. Pick the best one and find new teams through some of the people you like and play well with.
slowpitch,fffc4n9,t1_ffduxyr,1579880705.0,You're better off lurking at other games or tourneys and trying to get picked up on a team who can actually play. It'll save your sanity.

slowpitch,fffbxr0,t1_ffdylse,1579880584.0,"We have this guy. Loveable dude. Can only hit the ball 100 feet. Plays catcher. Near top batting average on the team that doinks over the infield every AB.

I think we're fortunate to have him honestly."

churning,ffc9xk7,t3_esr1bo,1579794874.0,"referred myself for a CIP2 from CIP1. Got denied and had to call recon to straighten it out and get approved.

I havent received the 20k bonus yet but i was only approved on 1/4.

Should it take longer than this to receive the bonus or did something get screwed up because my app was initially denied?"
YouShouldKnow,ffar3mc,t1_ffaabuq,1579742521.0,Great!! Did not know this! Thank you kind sir!

If you're content, stick with it man. I have a good job with good benefits and am casually looking elsewhere for other jobs but nothing comes close to the gig I have now. I want a good work-life balance (which I have).

Find things to do and be ambitious about outside of work. You can move up, get better, improve, etc at hobbies, side hustles, yard work, and all sorts of other things outside of work."

baseball,ff75bj2,t1_ff6kwb2,1579641420.0,Good. Fuckin do it. Bridich is a cancer to the team. Any stretch of good ball we have gets fucking plagued by his stupid decisions.
baseball,ff6hrbr,t3_erq3m4,1579627469.0,"How many years do you need to play at the top of your game, be the best in the league, to have Lebron status in saying who stays and who goes? Coaches, players, or FO?

Is he there yet? Can he pull a ""Bridich or Me"" card yet?

Cause nows the fucking time..."
AskAnAmerican,ff6f7yu,t3_erv98w,1579625895.0,"This is one of a few reasons why I refuse to move too far away from Denver. Im close to the train (15 walk, 3 min drive), Ubers usually arent more than 20-25 or so to the city and back.. split it with a friend or 3 and its cheap.

We're looking at houses now.. alot of what we like and can afford are in the burbs.. but even thinking about moving there depresses me and moving to rural Colorado is not even a consideration for us. Both my parents live in the middle of no where in Ohio and I just can't handle more than 3 days there.

FWIW, I had a DUI 10 years ago (on the 26th actually) in college. 1-2 years before uber/lyft became an option. It's completely changed the game now and I love it.

Taxi's were ""available"".. if you wanted to order one knowing you had to wait 2-3 hours for it to even show up.. then possibly be taken by someone else if you weren't there within the 5 minute window they offered.

Rarely do we have DD.. but every now and then someone has other shit to do so they can't drink much anyway so we roll with them to brunch or something and uber back home later that day."
