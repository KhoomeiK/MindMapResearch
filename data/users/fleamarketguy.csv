thenetherlands,ffhxi6y,t1_ffht40g,1579958210.0,"Maastricht is quite modern. But the buildings in the center are just old. If you want a more new looking city, your best option is Eindhoven."
thenetherlands,ffhsm3i,t3_etp8ay,1579951791.0,"Maastricht is a very international city due to its university and its proximity to the Belgian and the German border. Native Maastricht inhabitants like to call themselves burgundians and historically speaking they have a lot of French influences. Maastricht has a similar atmosphere and vibe as Amsterdam, Utrecht and Den Bosch due to the similar building style. Nonetheless, Maastricht is not a really big city compared to e.g. Amsterdam. But you can easily get everywhere by bike or bus. It probably takes you 30 minutes to cycle accross the city.

The nightlife in the city centre is mostly focused on students, hence the bars in the city centre and the the two main squares play mostly charts music, a bit more out of tje center and it is more towards Dutch/Limburgish music. There is not really a clubbing culture, there are 2/3 decent clubs, but they mainly focus on Techno. Although Muziekgieterij has a lot of bands as well. My favourite go to places are Complex (Technoclub), Gouverneur (craft beer bar) and Shamrock (Irish pub). Carnaval is huge in Maastricht, it is every year in February and you dress-upnas whatever you want, get drunk and party for 5 days. Although the carnav music can be reaaaaaally shit.

There are three cinemas, 2 are focused on the bif blockbuster movies and 1 on the alternative, smaller movies. There are many restaurants in Maastricht and I try to take another one every time I go out for diner.

There is a decent amount of nature in and around Maastricht. There are several city parks, St. Pietersberg and a lot of fields and forrests around the city. 

Whatever your hobby is, you will probably find people to share your hobby with. Even as a non-Dutch speaking person.

This also means that cultural wise Maastricht is a bit different compared to the rest of Zuid-Limburg. The Parkstad area (Heerlen, Brunssum, Landgraaf, Kerkrade) is culturally different. The area itself is quite ""poor""  for Dutch standards and the cities I mentioned are not appealing to me at all. Furtheremore, the area has some German influence, for example in the local dialects.

Lastly, Eindhoven is not my cup of tea, but it is a very nice and modern looking city. I like to call it Heerlen with money. It is very central in the country and very much focused on technology. Furthermore, I think people in Noord-Brabant (province in which Eindhoven is located) are a bit more inclusive and welcoming to outsiders and newcomers. They also have carnaval, but a bit different and in my opinion less fun than Maastricht.

In my opinion Maastricht is a lovely city to live, especially as an international. Everything is easily reachable by bike. The inhabitans are a bit less arrogant than the people from Amsterdam, but very stubborn. If I didn't have to move for my job, I would have loved to stay here."

Just that anti-semitism was very common back then. 

The extent of the holocaust was not clear in the beginning of the war. It started out with deportation/prison camps/ghettos. Which are of course horrible, but not unique to the nazis. Many countries employed similar practices back then, also allied countries (e.g. France was known for sending people overseas to detain them).

The mass murders started in 1941, first mostly by gunfire, later by gas. The nazis unfortunately did a good job of hiding what they were doing exactly. There were rumours, but it was not really believed in the beginning. Later on in the war it was more and more known what the nazis were actually doing.

A lot of countries declared war on Germany because they were attacked or because Germany attacked other countries, not because of what nazis were doing with unwanted minorities. The US got involved at the end of 1941, so before that they had no reason to not do business with Germany, because the US was neutral.

Neem bijvoorbeeld topsporters, Ziyech verdient ook heel veel keer wat de schoonmakers bij Ajax verdienen.

Of artiesten zoals als Martin Garrix of Armin van Buuren, die in principe gewoon BV's zijn, en ook een heel team om zich heen hebben verdienen ook vele malen meer dan de minst betaalde persoon in hun team.

Iedereen klaagt steeds dat topmanagers heel veel verdienen, maar over artiesten hoor je nooit iets. Die mensen zitten daar niet zomaar, maar omdat de mensen die die personen aanstellen vinden dat ze daar horen te zitten met dat salaris. Naar mijn mening mag een privaat bedrijf, binnen de wet, doen en laten met hun geld wat zij willen. Bij overheidsorganisaties is dat natuurlijk een ander verhaal."
