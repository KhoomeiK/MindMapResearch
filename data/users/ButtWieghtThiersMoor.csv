madlads,ff9315o,t1_ff91rnv,1579703613.0,average windshield is 1888 sq in.  At 1m depth PSI is 1.4  So if the windshield is already submerged you will need about 2643 lbs of force to kick out the windshield.  This is not including the force that normally bonds the windshield to the body.  If you are deeper you'll need that force for every meter of water. I hope you didn't skip leg day.
