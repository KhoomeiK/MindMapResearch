SkincareAddiction,ffw9a3r,t1_ffvfrie,1580290630.0,"Same, some people rotate through their actives and main ingredients; retinol, vitamin C and acids, niacinamide or antioxidants for example can't (or shouldn't in some cases) all be used together (or need a long enough wait time, or are too irritating together etc).
 I also have 3 moisturizers (with different purposes & ingredients) and 2 of them I have already repurchased, and if I end up not liking one of them, boom, it's a hand or body cream."
malepolish,ffsw9js,t1_ffstw2o,1580195022.0,Thanks for looking it up! I love combinations like this! :)
malepolish,ffsv7yi,t1_fflt97a,1580193786.0,"I did that once. I asked a then closeted trans women (who I thought was ""just"" a feminine guy) why they wore nail polish. I meant it as an innocent question back then, wanted to find out if they wore it because they liked it or maybe someone painted their nails for fun, but in hindsight I feel so bad for it, because it sounded like I might've questioned their gender expression (or even if they were 'just a man' as I thought, I wouldn't want someone to feel like I thought it was weird). I did meet a cis man once who had them painted once for silly fun and then decided that he liked and who was happy to talk about it, and I just asked out of silly curiosity. If you're insecure I suggest to have a sentence in place like 'I always liked how it looked on others/on person X/(or whatever is true for you) and so I tried myself and really enjoyed it"" because then it's all explained and still not made into a big deal. :)"
malepolish,ffcb8vi,t3_esntx1,1579795700.0,It's so damn cool!
torties,ff8kuq9,t3_es1hpb,1579683358.0,"Male or female, such a beauty! I hope this cat finds a good home!"
aww,ff4cg12,t3_erl1bl,1579560364.0,Aww he does look like a big baby! And how cute is the colouring on his head! Give us more photos!!
Hair,ff4c048,t3_erl00o,1579560053.0,"I like your hair colour! I don't know much about haircuts, but I was wondering if you're okay with styling it in the morning or if you want a cut that doesn't need any ""help"". Maybe that'll help others to find a good look for you! :)"
torties,fer65yi,t3_eq8cp7,1579350362.0,Ohhh she reminds me of a floof I rescued but had to give away! Such a beauty!
malepolish,fejyvhi,t3_epecrs,1579188973.0,I love that colour and how you wear it! Have another compliment <3 what's the name and brand of the polish?
lgbt,fef9r98,t1_feeu8e1,1579051523.0,"There is nail polish that is designed to taste disgustingly bitter to help you stop biting them. I used to bite them, but never with that polish on them (or just once haha). Maybe you'd want to try it out :) it's mostly sold as a clear coat!"
EuroSkincare,fedsd1n,t1_fecwvfq,1579018860.0,"I have it too, and I really like it! Already had to replace it once!
E: oh, and I also own the urea 15% Sofortpflege as a body lotion, especially for dry legs and some ingrown hairs, it does moisturize them well enough for my after a shower :)!"
SkincareAddicts,fedr4k3,t1_febm9z4,1579018093.0,"Darker skin has a bit of a natural spf, (afaik up to 13ish spf). With those kinds of active skincare ingredients you definitely would want to use sunscreen, because they make you more prone to sun damage otherwise!"
aww,fedp8ki,t3_eojpt6,1579016908.0,Yeeees! They're very awww! More pics please (a full Imgur album :3)!
SkincareAddicts,fe9kvr6,t1_fe6j19c,1578938797.0,"If you try Retinol/retin-A or chemical peels like glycolic acid, it's important to use a sunscreen during daytime (afaik at least SPF 30!). Just adding this in case you didn't know, or are not using one already. (:"
aww,fe8u3tx,t1_fe8mz2v,1578930886.0,That's so nice!! If I die early please let me be reborn as your next cat!

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdjtv9w,t1_fdjp21x,1578487308.0,Why?
aww,fcyxm84,t3_ejhuow,1578089321.0,"Yes, this dog looks mad (in a good way)! Although this pic does look a bit more like r/whatswrongwithyourdog than r/aww ! :D"
BeautyAddiction,fcxl4za,t1_fcw6a5t,1578065579.0,"I love the zodiac one too! I like the purples and the selection of mattes and shimmers! And I agree, the shadow perform really well! :)"
EuroSkincare,fcxip6j,t3_ej6yei,1578063911.0,"I'm german and in the same boat. I don't know of any good german brands that do retinol sadly, so I'm planning to get some from TO after finishing my bottle of granactive retinoid. In my city they even have a physical store, so no shipping needed! :)

ETA: as a moisturiser I use sebamed vitamin e 2% and I quite like it. I also have another moisturiser that has a lot of urea from the 'medicated' section of rossman (or DM, not sure, also forgot the brand and I'm currently not at home). For sunscreen I ordered the Dr jetske ultee suncover spf 30 bc it has very good filters and is reasonable priced! I'm on my second 250ml bottle and I like it so far, it's a bit greasy and shiny but I just blot some powder over it and it's all good."
beauty,fcvgduq,t3_eiz7ie,1578001534.0,"I think I am you apart from the smoking - I vape. I have an appointment with a derm in february, I hope they can help me! Let us/me know if you find a cure!

ETA: I hate how I can't stop picking them (I know it's bad) but the comments convinced me to give the 'no picking' another go..."
Hair,fch3myo,t1_fcfupag,1577646940.0,I agree with that! It's a gorgeous look!
