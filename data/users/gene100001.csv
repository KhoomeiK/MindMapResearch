I think a lot of people think that the scientists/research groups themselves are the ones profiting from their publications, which is the opposite of reality. Scientists want their research to be as accessible as possible. It's the system around funding that's broken.

A possible analogy for blindly enforcing open access publications for public research would be the government telling a successful YouTuber they will only fund them if they average 5 million views per video, but then also telling them that they can't publish on YouTube. Instead they have to publish on a bunch of shitty video sites no-one has heard of.

Take a look at [this map](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_food). Almost every other country in the world has food as a human right, including dictatorships and poor nations. The US is the richest country in the world and it is one of the only ones without food as a human right. That should tell you how out of touch the US is with the rest of the world, and how little its leaders respect its citizens

Edit : also have a look at [this list](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_systems_by_country) of the health care systems in each country.

There are very very few people who can pull in the budget required to push an entirely new technology into cinemas around the world. When he does get that funding he's obligated to target as broad an audience as possible to maximise profits for the big investment/risk involved.

newzealand,fc91iin,t1_fc7ffmt,1577545511.0,"Yea you're right I shouldn't have appealed to popular thought. You're also right that most of my other arguments don't seem to be directed at them but in other comments in different threads the same user had shared similar views to the upstream poster, where they were focused solely on the fact that less cats is good for native fauna, which I don't think is a very nice point to be focusing on in this particular incident"
newzealand,fc8zyvm,t1_fc7l3xd,1577544817.0,"I know about all the things you listed in 1. I'm doing a PhD in biomedical science. I just wanted to know if your reasoning was the utility to humans presented by nature. That's a fine approach to take, however I'm doubtful about the utility we could gain from bioprospecting the native fauna living in Palmerston North suburbs. Bioprospecting is an extremely expensive and time consuming discovery tool in biology. The only things it discovers these days are in organisms that evolved in extreme environments, or organisms that are extremely unique in a way that is relevant to humans (eg long life or ability to regrow limbs) because those are the only places where it makes economic sense to look. The birds living* in the middle of palmerston north are none of these things. Their genome and proteome are not being investigated for any utility and I doubt they ever will be. 

That being said, I still think we should preserve nature for the sake of it, but like I've already said there are better ways to control cat numbers and limit their effects on nature. Yea you're right that a lot of people aren't taking the responsibility they should be taking, and I can see how that can be frustrating. But coming on the thread full of people upset about some teenagers driving over a pet cat and going ""but ackchyually... "" has not helped your cause, and has only served to further entrench the belief that people like Gareth Morgan are heartless demons who hate cats (not something I believe btw). The biggest problem with Gareth Morgan is his approach. It's why he'll never achieve any progress. Don't follow suit"
newzealand,fc75j0d,t1_fc709wh,1577498099.0,"> So any and all comparisons to Nazi are godwins law and thus means you don't have to think or respond.

No not all comparisons to Nazis are Godwin's law, but your comparison to Nazis on a reddit thread about a cat getting run over most certainly is. 

You're right that popular appeal doesn't automatically denote correctness, so I was wrong to imply that. However, receiving a negative response from society about a moral dilemma should at least make someone reassess their opinion rather than simply charging on. I honestly don't think you or the other guy have considered the ethics at play here at all. Your line of thinking of cats = bad for native fauna therefore cat death = good is so utterly simplistic. Here's some things for you to consider :

1) why is preserving native fauna good? I'm not saying it isn't good, but you need to think about precise reasons why. For instance do you think it is good because biodiversity serves utility to people?, or because diversity is nice to look at? Or do you simply want to protect biodiversity for the sake of biodiversity?

2) How important do you think it is to avoid human emotional suffering and protect human wellbeing? If you think preserving native fauna is good because nature provides utility to humans, why do you think that utility is better than the utility the cat served in this family's life? Do you think 30 more native birds in the bush bring as much happiness to this family, or to people as a whole than this family got from that cat? I'm doubtful about that. I'm also certain that having their cat killed in front of them in that manner gave them a lot more suffering than they would feel from 30 native birds dying.

3) If you don't put that much value on human emotional suffering (ie you think the suffering of the family is of low importance in this instance), and simply think we should protect our native fauna for the sake of it , have you ever sat down for a long time and thought about why that is? I personally find it deeply immoral to put an arbitrary concept like ""protecting species for the sake of it"" ahead of human suffering. 

4) As I already mentioned in a previous comment, did you consider that cat numbers can be reduced in ways that don't cause suffering for people or the cats themselves (which are also living intelligent creatures)?. Amazingly enough there are ways to reduce cat numbers  without driving over them with cars in front of their owners. 

5) Do you put any value on having a respectful society that cares about the wellbeing of it's members? Because a society where people can intentionally run over people's beloved pets and mock them afterwards, and then be congratulated for their actions simply because they inadvertently saved some native fauna is not a society that gives a shit about the people in it.

It seems to me that you're willing to ignore the suffering of the family, ignore the suffering of the cat, and ignore the damage to the fabric of our society caused by congratulating this incident, simply because it means 30 more native birds get to live. 

Do you think all the people downvoting you are just supportive of the family because they think ""ooh cute cats"" and are somehow stupid and unaware of the effect cats can have on native fauna? That's the impression I get. The action of the people in the car was immoral, and the suffering of the family was real regardless of whether the cat would've killed native fauna. That's why you and the other guy are getting downvoted."

Edit: also just to play along with your nazi argument, did you forget about the bit where the rest of the world overwhelmingly didn't like the nazis, and rose up against them, resulting in ww2 and the eventual demise of the nazis? How does that fit in with your shitty argument?"
newzealand,fc5h42p,t1_fc4zhv0,1577457426.0,"Imagine getting an overwhelming negative response to your thoughts and comments and still thinking you're right. 

There is a difference between introducing laws around neutering, cat ownership, and keeping pets indoors, and brutally running over someone's pet in front of them and celebrating. By your logic some psychopath going outside and torturing and killing cats is acceptable because it leads to more native birds saved. The fact you can't empathise with the owners here is truly disturbing. 

You seem to think that you're applying some sort of utilitarian logic when you say thousands of birds are saved, but you are ignoring the fact that there are more ethical ways to achieve the same result. The end doesn't justify the means. What you're showing is *edge* because you're so sure you're right when you're not"
