There's a high chance that you're either exaggerating or a victim of a forgetful memory here. I felt the same way with one of my kids, and when I pointed it out to my husband, he said that he'd been acting up and slowly getting worse for weeks leading up to this conversation. I just hadn't noticed, which I'm sure was part of the reason he got so bad... You can't fix problems if you aren't aware of them in the first place... He had been getting away with things for a while... I just didn't noticed until they were really bad. This leads to the following:

>He does not listen at all

>screams and kicks like a maniac when he doesn’t get his way.

Tantrums are normal for kids, including at 5yo. The best way to handle these are basically ""cry it out"". Just put them in a place where they aren't in danger or disturbing everybody else, and let them have at it. NEVER cave in to a tantrum! You can try sitting with them and explaining why your answer was no or why they can't do something, but also remind them that tantrums will never change the answer. It could take days, it could take months, but if you stick to your word and ignore them during these tantrums, they'll eventually learn that they don't get anything out of them and they'll stop.

>All of his actions have consequences

Again, it's incredibly important that you are consistent with this. Never make a threat or a promise that you can't keep, because once you don't follow through, they will question their trust in you. If you let them get away once, they'll continue to test you. 

We found that it helped us, family and babysitters stay consistent by typing and printing out the rules and the consequences to breaking each of them, then we hung it on the wall in the laundry room, that way we could avoid over or under punishing an action. We also made and hung a reward chart for good behavior.

Finally, I found keeping a journal really helped me. It's hard to keep your memory straight when you're currently frustrated. Write down what behaviors are bothering you the most right now and check back in a week or so. You may be so busy frustrated with right now that you're forgetting the progress that he's made. ""Yes, today's tantrums are terrible, but hey... He hasn't thrown his food in a month!  That phase is over!"" Seeing progress helps keep you motivated and less frustrated with what's going on right now because it reminds you that this too shall pass!"

It doesn't hurt me; they have a right to believe what they want and I can just ignore them and walk away. 

What bothers me is when people try to use their religious beliefs as a way to control my life. I despise people who try to vote away someone else's rights, and the most common excuse for that is religion."
atheism,ffabiaz,t3_esixjy,1579731661.0,"I get it. But it's also important to understand that even though you and I think religion and god is a farce, it really does help some people. For some people, all it takes is a prayer and the belief that ""it's all in God's hands now"" to relieve them of stress... I wish I could do that, but I just can't bring myself to believe in it, therefore it does nothing for my stress. If that's all it takes for him, that's great. But now you have to find out how big of a deal he's going to make of this.

You need to have a discussion about what his plans are and decide what to do as a couple. If he can follow religion and leave it out of the relationship and kids, that's great... But if you plan on having kids and he thinks it needs to be in their lives, it's going to be an issue and you may as well consider splitting up and not getting married.

It's going to be hard to bring up if you're worried about offending him, but it has to be done. I don't k ow of any magical way to bring it up nicely, but my best advice is bringing it up when you're both calm. DO NOT do it spur of the moment when you're frustrated, because all that will come of that is words that you regret."
