I think what your looking for is the gentleman that gives you the Rotom Magazine, a Key Item for Rotom to “swap forms” with. :)

The gentleman is in one of the house in Wyndon. He has the appearance of League Staff. His Pokémon I believe is around 36~40 give or take.

Once you beat him in battle, he will give you the item.

Other than that, the Rotom Bike is just that; Rotom Bike. Can’t use it in battle but to zoom around. You get floaties/floating tires upgrade for it after beating Opal who I think is the fifth gym.

You can after get more Rotoms in the Lake of Outrage during thunder weather I believe.

Hope that helps!! :)"

Never again.

WC pay was SHIT compared to working normally. I struggle enough as is to make ends meet and that me back!

I’d rather suffer and live with it and chance it than do WC again."

Please know he’s in a better place and is no longer suffering.

He waits for you at the end of the Rainbow Bridge."

It’s carbonated for sure though.

It’s sold mostly in Asian specialty stores.

It’s can certainly be seen as “weaboo juice” but I don’t give one damn. 

Ramune is great and I’d recommend giving it a try.

It comes in a variety of flavors :)"
NintendoSwitch,ffcyggu,t3_esugn2,1579809869.0,"Is there a demo for this game? I’d like to give it a try to see if I really would like it.

It seems like something I’d enjoy from the trailer but I just wanna make sure if that makes any sense...?"
neckbeardRPG,ffcy5xb,t3_esoooe,1579809695.0,"I fucking love Ramune.

I love the melon and strawberry flavor best."
