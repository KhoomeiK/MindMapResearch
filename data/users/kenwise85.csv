niceguys,fdhy0nz,t1_fdhf133,1578432217.0,"Right here, Internet Friend. 

I spent junior high and high school being painfully shy, and thus no dates. This continued on for a while and then, when I was 20, I met, Her. Third girl ever to notice me in that way, so naturally I glommed on hard. We dated for 4 months. A month in we went exclusive, then shortly after she felt trapped and ended it. 

Then, a week later, she said she made a mistake and we got back together, but not exclusive. Yay!

Then, of course, it ended. She was doing things with someone else that made her feel uncomfortable seeing multiple people. I told myself just bad timing or whatever, didn't work for each other right now. But, maybe at some point it could, if she didn't work out with this guy. 

So, I became her ""best friend"" for the next 6 years. I figured, I'm here, in the friend zone,  and soon she'll see how nice I was compared to all the assholes she was dating. On and on it went. And I held on to hope, never mentioned what I was wanted, just was there being a friend. Getting more pissed, feeling overlooked, and honestly entitled. 

Once she called me out on it.  I was shit talking her ex that she was hooking up  with again. I told her I thought he'd hurt her again, and she said I was just mad she wasn't fucking me. Again... yay... Eventually, I decided to ask about us trying again. No go, just friends. And then, less and less replies to text and more missed calls. Then silence. 

So, after a time, I decided to get over her and move on. And I did. Made friends, met new girls, got a lot less shy and a lot more attention. And eventually snagged some dates and even a girlfriend. And now I'm here, many years past meeting Her, much much better off. I'm still with my girlfriend and going on 4 years now.

I see now how awful I was. Under the guise of friendship I was deceptive, and actively worked to manipulate someone to my ends. I would have never admitted it then, I'd have said I was trying to protect Her, to keep her safe. That just also happened to be synonymous with mine, something I didn't dwell on. 

So yeah, stop fixating on how you're owed anything. And don't manipulate. If someone wants to be with you, cool! If not, find someone who does. Anyway, there's my redemption arc. Thank you for listening."

helpmecope,fdg9bqc,t3_el712z,1578385599.0,"I'm sorry that has happened to you. That must be violating, I can't even imagine. I think something that may help is getting out in front of it. With professional help (therapy) you can figure out a way to accept and own it. 

Once you get there it'll be far easier to deal with it coming up because it won't trigger anything in you. 

Again I am so sorry that someone hurt you like this. I wish you well, Internet Friend. Godspeed"

My thinking is all it takes is one in every 10 to upvote and it hits the top pretty quickly. Most people probably aren't thinking in terms of shit posts or validation seeking, and story of dickish guy being a dick to a girl who did nothing wrong let's us feel like we're I'm the right by agreeing with her position.

facepalm,fcvtfmp,t1_fcvqaxy,1578009704.0,"Agreed, a lot of the systems in place now operate (by necessity) within a framework of transactional exchanges. 

Ideally there'd be a worldwide commitment to distribution of food and water, shelter, clothes, and access to education (fundamental for  several human rights) to all, before any economic concerns are considered. 

The technology and industry exist to make this happen, and I'd love to see a grand change in this direction. Then no nation states would need aid and people would be in a position to build their lives to their fullest potential. But, the resistance of the already wealthy makes this more dream that reality for now."
facepalm,fctov1h,t1_fctejal,1577952038.0,"Really we're all becoming more and more out of touch. This world is deeply fractured and the way we consume information these days has altered our shared reality. 

I definitely don't have the answers, but they will be found outside the box. The current structure operates on imposed scarcity, and that can't last forever. 

We, as a species, have the technological power to feed, clothe, house, educate, and keep well every human on the planet. The limitation is logistics and getting resources where they are needed. 8n a post wealth world, maybe. But for now the idea of need, at exclusion of the other, dominates."
facepalm,fcta408,t1_fct2exr,1577936982.0,"'tis true, you never know who's on the other end. I think people trust systems and institutions too much. There's a reason we call it the establishment, because it is established. 

Now, I am a full on radical, I know this. But, I am also wise enough to know that with wealth granting power, and money embedded in our political structure, I got no juice. 

So, while I believe the nation state (if we must have one) ought to see to all of its people's needs, I know that what we get is going to be very different.

I guess smaller numbers are easier for math, I hadn't thought of that. Seriously though, government has not really done much for me.  Ambition tends to serve itself and is pretty much a requirement in politics. 

On average, regardless if Team Edward or Team Jacob wins, not a whole lot changes at the street level. I just try to get from one day to the next while the State rolls from one oligarch/plutocrat to the next."
