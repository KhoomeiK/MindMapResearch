PraiseTheCameraMan,fdtdog9,t1_fdst2km,1578715272.0,So the coalition of the ÖVP and FPÖ failed a while ago because Heinz Christan strache at the time leader of the FPÖ was secretly filmed trying to sell out Austria with support from Russia. When the coalition failed there was an expert group put in charge until the new elections. In these the elections the FPÖ who was Second or third strongest party lost a lot of votes and the green party who lost a lot in the election before got a lot stronger . So now the ÖVP and Greens are forming a coalition. Sorry if there are some mistakes I am on the phone and on the toilet writing this.

HistoryMemes,fcxpy80,t1_fcxppgb,1578068699.0,Yeah true I would think it is more like the beginning of the end like Russia turning communist was part of what started the Second world war. So I don't think there was much talk in the 20s of the next world war but in the 30s.
