Manufacture a cover for the engine to help cut down on noise and disguise it as a BBQ grill. Bonus points if it's a working propane grill for snacks. Replace the steering wheel with a bowl, and fill it with potato chips, or maybe a jello casserole."
MapPorn,fff1i0f,t1_ffey6um,1579873113.0,Wisconsin has a combination of heavy snowfall and a strong dairy industry. This means that rural roads which would be dirt or gravel in other places are paved in Wisconsin so that the daily milk deliveries from all those cows can get through.
BurningMan,ffd66zd,t1_ffd4fmx,1579814198.0,"Two possibilities. A very restrictive list of requirements means the poster has a specific applicant in mind, but needs to post an ad to check off a requirement. The other is the common understanding that job requirements are more of a wishlist than an actual requirement."

Shadowrun,ff1a5yy,t1_ff14ari,1579476765.0,"Yeah, personally I feel like bricking guns is a waste of a decker's talent. GMs are fine with editing cameras on the fly to make characters technologically invisible... why not do that to the opponent's gear. Or better yet, fool the enemy into shooting each other. Crashing the local food delivery drones, or better yet a crosstown bus into your enemies can be a fun option too. All better options than destroying a single easily replaceable gun."

Discord_Bots,fetvcr1,t3_eqloxd,1579380430.0,"You can't display mesages in a channel for just one person. The easiest thing to do would be to send a DM to the user with the translation. Alternatively, you could do something weird like deleting the original message, replacing it with a bot-written message that includes the translation as a spoiler following the original, or just posting the spoilered translation after the original. 

There's a Google api for automatically detecting and translating text, which should make this bot trivial to create once you decided how the translation should be displayed."

Discord_Bots,febqgrk,t1_febdusr,1578961598.0,"Blocking a user from using the bot on every server because they have a blocking role on one server sounds like a bad idea to me.  Unless you're explicitly writing a bot with interactivity between servers you always want to treat guildid+userid as a unique individual, and in some cases you even want to include channelid as well so that the bots responses can differentiate between activities in different channels on the same server. Adding a blacklist of guildid/userid combos wouldn't be that hard.  It adds some complexity to ensure that nobody accidentally bans everyone with unban permission, but presumably this would be part of a bot that already has administrative users, so including a blanket amnesty for them or just the server owner wouldn't be difficult."

BurningMan,fdwy522,t1_fdwkc22,1578763416.0,"It's already effectively a lottery, and it's been long enough since the first lottery that the ""problems"" associated with it have been solved. Why not just collect payment and purchase info as a part of your pre-sale sign up info. Then assign everyone a number and begin selling tickets. If getting sale info in advance is too complicated, just assign people rolling start dates, with reasonable numbers of people in each group so that the system isn't overwhelmed by everyone jumping on to purchase at once. There are months to spread the sale out over, and no particular reason to do it all in one day."

BurningMan,fdqqjmf,t1_fdhnre5,1578672734.0,"There used to be a certain cache associated with having the cheaper tickets. You were ""more of a burner"" if you were on the ball and bought early enough to get the cheaper tier tickets. The Org always pitched it as a way for people with money to support the event by buying the more expensive tickets, but I've never known anyone that was rich enough to toss money away that way."

Discord_Bots,fdo5271,t1_fdo3613,1578599032.0,"You're basically running a web page from your bot, so your main web page can send data to it and receive information back. There are probably better ways to do it, but I'm guessing your web provider doesn't offer access that would let you use a better way. You might want to investigate that if you haven't already.

Depending on your use case, you could also allow your web page to access a database running on your server. There are positive and negatives to that as well."

Discord_Bots,fdkbwm3,t1_fdk9wrh,1578500613.0,"No reason to scrap the GUID and force the user to recreate it every time they want to edit the config. It's more secure than any password a user is likely to pick, and letting them bookmark the link makes it easier on the user in the future. If you're really concerned about security, perhaps record the IP of the access and ping the user on Discord for authentication if it's new."
Discord_Bots,fdk4jfg,t3_elt44r,1578495875.0,"I wanted some web integration in my bot and just rolled my own. Mine was a bit more complicated so I won't go into it, but for just configuring a bot it would be easier. A simple web page that accesses your config settings, with a password that maps to a particular server/user. For instance, when an Admin asks for the config link, DM them a url with a random guid included as an argument. In your database assign that guid to that particular user/server pair. Now when the website is accessed with that link it knows which server to display and which user to log the actions for, assuming you care about logging."
BurningMan,fcyyg96,t1_fcyvpwt,1578089859.0,"I think an easier solution than shutting down the event for a year (which would kill the Org as a company) would be to sell the tickets without a DGS allotment before Theme Camp applications are taken. Once people know who has tickets and there's been some time to allow for planning based on that information then open up applications for Theme Camps. Sure, people would complain about not being able to do the same damn thing they've done every other year in the past, and some people building businesses around the event would have difficulty making the same profits, but I think it would allow for much more turnover in camps and activities people set up."
