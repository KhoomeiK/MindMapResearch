HomeImprovement,feyuqrv,t3_eqy4zh,1579450774.0,"Take some newspaper and light it, shove it up near the top to ""prime"" the chimney.  What is happening is the cold air in the chimney is preventing the smoke from rising so you get a little smoke in.  The newspaper will help warm up the chimney to get it pulling smoke up.

If you get a little smoke inside when you first light it, it isnt a big deal and isn't that out of the ordinary.  It's a lot of smoke you need to be concerned with.  As long as its minor, don't worry.


As for the fire itself, you need newspaper(or brown bags) but you also need kindling.  Small dry sticks.  There are different ways of building a fire but I have always been partial to the ""log cabin"" method.  Here is an illustration I found to show you what I mean.  http://www.comingbackalive.com/images/cba/drawings/logcabin.gif

Frame out the log cabin with your small kindling, fill the inside with newspaper.  Then put 2 small logs on top of it.  Light the paper.  It should burn well if the wood is dry.  If you have troubles you can look into buying some fatwood.  Throw 2 sticks of that on top of the paper inside the ""cabin"" and light it."
