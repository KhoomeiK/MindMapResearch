CasualConversation,fdpcn8z,t1_fdp92cf,1578625275.0,"I might just add to this though- it really depends on individual people. I've known some people, and we can get really deep and talk about our feelings, what made us feel that way, etc, opinions, views. But then other people I know just don't relate in the same way, and the conversation isn't about that kind of thing. Like, I tried talking to this one guy I knew, and he just didn't seem to understand the concept of talking about feelings. We weren't close friends, just friends and  I pressed it, and he said he mostly talked to his close friends about video games and things, since that's how he knew the friends. 

I think it also depends on context, like there are some people in my social bubble I'd never talk about deep feelings with, and just have more of a joking around relationship with.  Both are fine, you don't have to talk about that stuff if you don't want, but if you feel like you want people to talk feelings with, see if you can meet people elsewhere who you can connect with in the way that you want."
