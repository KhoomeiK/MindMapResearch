unpopularopinion,ff1exny,t1_ff1e28x,1579478326.0,I know but maybe as scots and Irish we haven't experienced the same degree of racism and all that goes along with it as say a black person. Their sensitivity levels are obviously increased for good reason. It's just like if someone makes a misogynistic comment I'm highly sensitive and never find it funny. For good reason.

unpopularopinion,ff1b5aq,t3_eqx3o1,1579477027.0,Maybe there's just an increased sensitivity around issues like race for good reason. I'm Scottish and depictions of Scottish people can at times be irritating but I'm not offended. Think it's different if ur race has experienced extreme levels of racism.

TrueOffMyChest,ff111gz,t1_ff0va42,1579474182.0,Sorry but having sex without protection is what caused the formation of a new life. U don't want that either use protection or abstain. Ending a human life is wrong especially because it's an inconvenience to u and ur life. People really need to stop succumbing to the brainwashing.
TrueOffMyChest,ff10oih,t3_er23ia,1579474054.0,Not sure why the word 'phobia' has to be involved. U might disagree with something from a moral standpoint but that doesn't make u phobic.

TrueOffMyChest,ff0talj,t1_ff0bphz,1579472050.0,You're lack of regard for another human beings life is cruel and disrespectful. Unborn doesn't mean inhuman.
CPTSD,ff0a354,t3_eqk0pb,1579466801.0,It's so often not a conscious choice though. U were harmed so sometimes people become harmful. I was that person. Experienced a lot of harm from birth right through my life. Then I became this angry rage fuelled monster who hurt others. I never made a conscious choice to be like that. I never thought it was ok to hurt others. I changed and have become a much better person but feel terrible for ever hurting anyone.
TrueOffMyChest,ff08z45,t3_eqzv8h,1579466477.0,Please reconsider ur decision. This child is a unique person and is your son or daughter. I think people are so brainwashed these days into thinking ending a human life is ok. It's not and never will be.

reactivedogs,feos67k,t3_eq4517,1579304665.0,Personally I don't think daycare is for every dog anyway. It's too high paced and intense for some dogs. Can't believe it was such a big deal ur dog baring her teeth. My two would do that if a dog they didn't like kept approaching them and I wouldn't have a problem with that.
Chriswatts,feooidw,t1_fenwplh,1579303078.0,I wouldn't be surprised if she was or wasn't either way. Just wonder though if she was involved why the police wouldn't have spotted it same way u have?

Chriswatts,fejcg4q,t1_feig7x2,1579167073.0,"Yes absolutely, but conspiring to murder three children and their mum is a wholly different matter. There are so many men and women up and down the country with standards like Nicole but how many would do what watts done?"

CPTSD,feb524a,t3_eo8jae,1578955487.0,I get u and have struggled with this my entire adult life. U need something that doesn't exacerbate ur anxiety and emotional issues. Maybe working in a highly social fast paced environment isn't good for u. What about something more solitary like dog walking or window cleaning? Environment might be the difference between u being able to cope in a job or not.

CPTSD,fe57ovk,t1_fe3vs3r,1578866322.0,Yes I cant believe the person I was purely because I was trying to cope with lifelong trauma. It's not something I feel I can even explain to anyone. U know why they say 'reality bites' because coming into reality can be so genuinely painful.
CPTSD,fe4i0nl,t1_fe3d5o1,1578859539.0,"Aw good. I think ur on a path to recovery pal, things will get better for u x"
CPTSD,fe3cpjm,t1_fe318gn,1578848088.0,Yeah I was the same. Addiction makes u disconnect with ur feelings because they're so painful but in turn that disconnect impacts on ur human relationships. Connect with ur experience and ul connect with others to a much greater degree. Have u read Bessel van der kolks book on trauma?
CPTSD,fe2zktg,t3_enmjqd,1578844500.0,"I think the first step in any real progress is completely acknowledging what actually happened to you. Seeing it for what it was, how wrong it was and how it affected you. You will get better if ur brace enough to do this.
