TaylorSwift,ffoanch,t1_ffo7840,1580075765.0,Imgur is one of the rudest places I’ve encountered for comments sometimes. Let her grieve for a moment for the loss of a friend.
lotrmemes,ffo49o4,t3_euc2pb,1580073982.0,I love this so much. The look of concentrated boredom one feels while straightening hair is spot-on.

TrueOffMyChest,ffnw6pe,t1_ffnu8g8,1580071515.0,"I will probably not know what it’s like to be in your position, no. You keep changing your argument though, which dilutes it as a whole. 

I’m not at all blaming transgender people. I never implied I did either. 

I think if you see a problem and it upsets you, use that fuel to educate others, not shut them down. I also hope you have a group of supportive people or a therapist to talk to because it’s good to talk to someone about stuff like this in a non-argumentative setting. Best of luck to you."
TrueOffMyChest,ffntrw6,t1_ffmfhyr,1580070710.0,"I’m not ignorant. I’m actually taking the time to look into things you’ve mentioned & tried to understand your view. Ignorant people don’t do that. 

It’s unwise to isolate a specific group and make a blanket statement that no one in that  group could ever commit a specific act. 

I’m simply stating that there is a chance that at some point someone who actually is/was transgendered could have possibly been a rapist- just like anyone else, regardless of their sexual identity. 

I am not at all agreeing with the people who are simply using the identity for their sick benefit; that definitely damages transgenders as a whole."
TrueOffMyChest,ffmextd,t1_ffmdsqv,1580053613.0,"Being transgender does not magically exclude someone of the potential of being a rapist. 

You’ve stated that no actual transgender person would do that and then state that if a transgender person did commit a rape, it denies them from being transgender. Your logic negates itself."
TrueOffMyChest,ffmd2cc,t1_ffmbmch,1580052634.0,"You can suffer from dysphoria and not be “trying to fight it.” It would depend on the psychological disorder. Some people don’t do well processing things internally and act out (sometimes in intense, terrible ways) as a result. 

I don’t know what gives you the right (unless you are the personal psychologist for Yaniv) to speak so confidently that Yaniv does not have dysphoria. 

Of course you can have your own opinion on how you view him/her (I’m not certain what the proper pronoun is because sources have used both, so I apologize for any inadvertent incorrectness), but please take notice that your argument that started as “all trenders” has narrowed to this one person."
mildlyinteresting,ffmbw8g,t3_eu6xf5,1580052049.0,"I’m going to need a explanation for this.

Edit: Apparently someone on r/askscience answered this years ago when someone else found square water droplets on a trampoline. https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/35i9w6/how_do_square_water_droplets_form/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
TrueOffMyChest,ffmb8pz,t1_ffm9qkj,1580051704.0,"Okay, for one, I’ve been asking for proof to back up your opinion and you have provided none, so it’s ironic that you would demand it now. 

Two, Yaniv’s actions (based on my quick perusal of google) could easily be related to Borderline Personality Disorder, Adjustment Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, or Dissociative Disorder all of which include dysphoria as a symptom. Therefore, it is possible for this person to suffer from dysphoria (proving your statement of “no dysphoria” false). 

Now, please take my words with a grain of salt because I am not a medical professional and I do not have full access to any psychological information on this person. I am solely stating that Yaniv could be suffering from other mental disorders that still include dysphoria. 

Regardless, this Yaniv person needs help and seems to be doing more negative than good in the community. It’s not okay for anyone to assault another person."
TrueOffMyChest,ffm90r2,t1_ffm4tyw,1580050680.0,"You’re still stating that out of all bathroom rapes, none of them have been from transgender people. To think that transgender people are not to be included in the possibility of committing rape is absurd. 

I am not familiar with that case, so I can’t speak on it much. However, I do hope you know that dysphoria relates to several psychological disorders/conditions and isn’t solely for gender.

Edit/Update: Just googled Yaniv. What a uniquely insane person... in so many ways. I feel like regardless of the gender Yaniv identifies with, they’re just a terrible person through & through."
mildlyinteresting,ffm6lq9,t1_ffm1jpz,1580049341.0,I think you mean “dam”
TrueOffMyChest,ffm4hwr,t1_ffm3f2m,1580048358.0,"Once again, just asking for a shred of proof/an example/etc. I mean, I watch the news and I haven’t seen any of this. I’m active online & I haven’t seen anything this extreme.  

“Properly trans people… respect the law”
Really? That means you are 100% certain that there is not a single one transgender person who has not committed rape in the whole history of humanity? I feel like that’s a pretty high pedestal to put an entire group of people on. We are all human, I’m sure every group of people (however you categorize them- by gender, race, job title, country) has law-abiding people as well as those who have committed crimes."
TrueOffMyChest,ffm2kup,t1_ffly8t7,1580047548.0,"Following your logic, you’re saying that no transgender person is ever a rapist or a creep and it’s only “trenders” who are the rapists and creeps. 

I’m also curious as to your proof in your opinion on this matter. Maybe it’s just in the communities you participate in, but I haven’t heard people blaming solely transgender people for these atrocities."
AskReddit,fflyt3u,t3_eu630g,1580045871.0,"My boyfriend enjoys cooking. (We met working at the same restaurant). I don’t know why, but watching him chop up veggies or fruit in the kitchen gets me every time."
TrueOffMyChest,fflvq84,t1_fflqjmm,1580044758.0,"Pretty sure putting a blanket statement and saying that another user “treat[s] dysphoric trans people as like they are creeps,” when you have no proof & probably don’t know that person in real life doesn’t reflect well on you."

NoStupidQuestions,feyr1v7,t3_eqx97g,1579449542.0,I think she means that there’s pauses and such in the sentences maybe. So it would seem like a slow conversation if you have to talk quietly and be constantly aware of someone else listening.
