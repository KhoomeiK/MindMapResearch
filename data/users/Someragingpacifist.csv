Hell, I'm very small, 5'4 and I'm a bass 2. On top of that I wasn't even born a male lmao. It's mostly based on your genes I guess, if your father and grandfathers had deep resonant voices with the low ranges of a bass, you most likely will too."
scad,ffdnuko,t3_esy8n9,1579824852.0,"I applied for as many scholarships as I could. I wouldnt be able to go here if I hadn't done very well in high school and submitted a solid art portfolio. 

Communicating with a financial aid adviser beforehand can definitely help you milk all your efforts for what they're worth and get you extra money off your tuition. 

I did my first year online too, which eliminated housing costs and whatnot. You can get some of your gen eds out of the way that way too while still being at home so you can work or whatever. 

Next year I'm possibly gonna be living off campus in an apartment because just living in a dorm and having a meal plan is so expensive especially considering how much better an apartment of a much lower price would be. Not that the dorms are bad, but it's quite expensive for their quality. That's just how all schools are. And crazy enough this is one of the cheaper art schools to go to."

ftm_irl,ffc8xmz,t3_esrd1z,1579794242.0,"Not supposed to hurt that bad. Make sure your binder is the right size. I understand the desire to go a size down but it is very unsafe. And if you're binding without a binder (using ace bandages or other dangerous methods) I ought to come over their and open up a can of whoop-ass on you.

After awhile though even with a real good binder, it doesnt get easier. You're just gonna always feel uncomfy but at least your dysphoria will be minimally helped."
fatlogic,ffbvw1e,t3_esqqw3,1579784513.0,"The thing is, I've mostly seen weight loss from some sort of disorder or illness in people who were already in shape. Recently I saw an Instagram post from an old high school friend who was average in terms of weight, not fat or even chubby, but not skinny. She looked very thin in her post and there were many comments complimenting her on her weight loss which made me really sad afterwards when I found out she was battling severe depression and wasnt really eating much, which I only found out because of a post a couple weeks later after she had gotten out of the hospital. 

I also had an aunt who was always on the leaner side and I found out she had breast cancer and the treatment made her so thin. It was so sad to see. Fortunately she's better now and we're hoping she stays that way. 

The thing is, all larger people I know who have lost weight have done so intentionally. Obviously that's not going to be the only reason for any person's weight loss so I never comment on it unless they've told me they're actively trying to lose weight - of course I'll compliment them in their progress. 

What this person is doing though is trying to guilt people out of complimenting weight loss entirely because theres ""nothing wrong"" with being fat and weight loss ""shouldn't be celebrated"" which pisses me off. Just because you dont care about your body doesnt mean you have to shit on other people's progress."

FTMMen,ffb1hqa,t3_esh7cq,1579749446.0,"Yeah I mean the packer itself can look realistic but doesnt look realistic in my pants. Even with an ""extra small"" packer the bulge is almost comically large and it just feels unnecessary, like when girls used to stuff their bras. I'm not insecure about my lack of dick because its not something people will notice unless I'm just in briefs (which is never lmao). What I care more about is what helps my dysphoria, and T has made me less dysphoric in my nether regions because I am fortunate enough to have gotten substantial growth down there and hope to get a meta within the next few years. I kinda already have the ""sensation"" of a little weenie so having a whole extra fake one in my pants to me feels like putting a coat over a jacket. Its not that cold and I was fine with the jacket and the coat is unnecessary and is making me uncomfortable."
AskReddit,ff6a2e9,t3_ero8mj,1579622643.0,"He'd be excited that I never gave up art and went to a great art school to become an animator. He'd wonder why I went for 3D instead of 2D though.

It doesn't match my voice even now that I've been on T for over a year, it's just a stranger's voice in terms of sound but it's my own inner voice I guess."

I don't even refer to classmates as ""men"" because even though we're in college it's the ""student"" part that makes my brain think ""young"". But I'm not a boy, I feel kinda miffed when I'm called a boy because I don't like being perceived as way younger than I actually am. I'm a guy or dude or bastard, doesn't matter too much. If I had to choose between boy and man, I'd say man because I'm an adult (even though I definitely dont feel like one)"

tifu,ff1honk,t3_eqxnrk,1579479394.0,"That's so sweet :)

At least I know some people have had worse stories from the airport than me. I still think about this one time - and I should mention I've always looked a lot younger than I am - where I was walking through to the TSA checkpoint and one of the employees was trying to make everything go faster so he asked me ""12 or under?"" And in a deep gruff voice I just reply ""I'm 20."" He profusely apologized. My mom thought it was hilarious, but I guess I was in a bitchy mood that day and didnt find it as funny as I do now lol"
AskReddit,fevm30k,t3_eqies2,1579398959.0,"One morning I was driving home from work. There was snow on the ground so anything that wasn't white was clearly visible. The roads where I am are bleached a pale gray from all the salt, so same thing for that. The sun was out for once, making everything clearly visible.

I saw a woman in a black coat and a light blue hat (with one of those pompoms) walking her dog, a golden retriever specifically, along the side of the street. Suddenly she decided to cross the street and I was driving right at her. I slammed on the brakes and my car slid on the slush on the ground and I held my breath because I was sure I would hit her. For a second I squeezed my eyes shut. When I opened them, my car was completely stopped and I didn't see them. I got out of my car to check, and there was nothing under or around my car. There was no woman or dog in sight, nowhere in the vast clearings on either side of the road, not on any driveways, nowhere. I got back in my car and drove home, wondering what the hell that was about.

I had been working a night shift and was on my way home from that, and I had been working the three nights before, all 12am-8:30am. The previous day I had gotten only a couple hours of sleep for those whole 48 hours and I was working 2 shifts within those hours that were very physically taxing (a lot of lifting heavy things and whatnot). I was very sleep deprived and must have hallucinated so vividly."

AmItheAsshole,fekzlhd,t3_epmdeh,1579210897.0,"Absolutely NTA. Actually it's not both you and your husband's money and I'm disgusted that she thinks she's entitled to your daughter's money. What kind of argument is that, that it could even be considered *partially* her father's money?

Not to be gruesome but if, for example, your daughter was still alive and maybe had a terminal illness, she would have made a decision about what to do with that money. By donating it to a specific charity like that (an awesome idea btw) you're doing your best to honor what she might have chosen to do with that money. She most certainly would not have given it to a random grown woman who should have her shit together. Maybe there's some other deal you can work out outside of this with her. 

I'm so sorry for your loss. You're a good mother, especially for respecting her passion after her death. It's always difficult losing anyone, and definitely when that person is so young and so dear to you. I'm sorry that your stepdaughter is being selfish with this and I hope you guys can come out the other side understanding each other better and become a closer family."

scad,fek7onm,t3_epl546,1579194331.0,"You dont need it right away if you're not taking a class that requires a lot of large project files that cant fit in your dropbox, such as a class where you'll be doing a lot of film editing or animation. 

But eventually you will need one and it's generally better to have an external hard drive than a thumb drive in my opinion. Mine is just a 500GB one off Amazon and it's been working without a hitch for a few years now and I've only used a small fraction of the storage. It's just one of the ones marked ""Amazon's choice"". 

Its tempting to get one of the little thumb drives that says ""256 GB"" only marked at $20 but those are never really that large. They're usually 8GB at best - it's easier to find a good external hard drive that's trustworthy. Unfortunately these things are usually $50-60 for a 1 or 2 TB one, wo if you dont need it now, start setting a bit of cash aside.  You really won't need one of the $100 8TB+ ones, it's just excessive and by the time you use it all up you'll be long out of college lol"

AskReddit,feipxf2,t3_ep7tm4,1579144287.0,"I remember around the time I lost my grandfather I was listening to a lot of Kurt Vile - it was early 2016 right after his arguably list depressing album came out and for some reason one of the more obscure songs on it ""Wild Imagination"" can still make me cry 4 years later. I saw him live last year and he played that song and I was just bawling in the audience and hiding my face.

I'm assuming top surgery will help my overall figure too considering most of my fat sits there even moreso than my belly. I dont even look like an ugly woman anymore but I do look like a high school kid in the weirdest part of puberty. I suppose it's like I'm a few years behind the puberty curve but its catching up to my age gradually. 

It's so hard to describe this phase and you never see it in before/after pictures because they're always basically pre-pubescent looking boy and then full bearded biker lookin dude, and sometimes an American eagle outfitters model kinda guy."
