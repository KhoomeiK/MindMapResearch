carbonsteel,fg72ozs,t1_fg6x3h4,1580582587.0,the next time i use it (probs next week) i will do the vinegar and metal scrub thing and just redo the whole bottom of the pan. i also use carbon steel woks but i've never had to strip the seasoning. it will be a good learning experience :)

carbonsteel,fg6r9mo,t1_fg6p1qq,1580575054.0,sorry for the mislabelling but it's obviously carbon steel. no cast iron would be that thin. and yes i own both lodge cast iron and carbon steel as well and yes the carbon steel is proving to be a bigger headache. v to be fair though i took the time to build 8 coats of seasoning on the cast iron 2 years ago. i was watching youtube vids of how people season their carbon steel pans and they basically just put one layer and say it's good to go lol

i dunno how to strip the seasoning to strip the rust and have it seasoned in time before it forms new rust lol. if i don't strip the rust, you think it'll get worse under the seasoning?"

u_alexaguilarp,ff91int,t3_erizht,1579702506.0,"you need to watch a lot of his interviews on youtube to get the whole picture, he has his own system. but in a nutshell, this is what he wants:    
- meditate, clear your mind until you reach that void where you are nowhere, no one, no time.     
- when you reach that space/void, that's where you get heart and mind coherence. it is important to get this coherence because it means you're not clinging on reality and letting it distract you  (remembering your aches, pains, problems, etc) and you're not thinking of the past/present/future either. all your energy is consolidated for the creation process (for your visualization)   
- when you have heart and mind coherence, your visualization with emotion can easily alter your reality. the visualization has to come with feelings. visualizing without feelings is not effective.   
- doing this entire system enough times where it comes to a point where your visualization with emotion is so strong you don't care anymore about if/when it'll happen, that's when it will happen."
