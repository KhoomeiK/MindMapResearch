So yes it came out after the articles of impeachment.

And Schiff mentioned it yesterday.

 ""This bombshell legal opinion from the independent Government Accountability Office demonstrates, without a doubt, that the Trump Administration illegally withheld security assistance from Ukraine. The publicly available evidence also shows that the President himself ordered this illegal act,"" Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said in a statement. ""

Maybe it wasn't just a lie of omission...and maybe that was more of a contractual thing which really crossed the line for them and ""strongly encouraged"" Peter to cut her loose.

And then they can dangle the carrot and ask her to come back so she can stir the pot and play villain. Which of course she will jump at because she thinks she has been wrongly accused and will do anything to have another chance to explain herself and convince Peter that his impression is wrong and that he based his decision off of someone else's opinion.
