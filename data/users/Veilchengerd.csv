rpg,femfh49,t3_epnyok,1579252754.0,"I really like Splittermond. I always found combat rounds pretty sluggish. Splittermond replaces rounds with ""ticks"", an abstract time measurement.
Every action is assigned a certain amount of these ticks. At the beginning of combat, initiative is established by dice roll. The character with the lowest initiative acts first. It is easiest to use a kind of gameboard to visualise the order of actions.
So, for example, one stab with a sword costs 7 ticks. You stab the orc, your marker moves 7 ticks forward. Now in all probability, someone else has the lowest initiative and it is their turn. And round and round it goes.
Dice rolls are just ordinary skill checks with the defense value of the opponent as threshold, though you can try to actively parry (3 ticks) to increase the difficulty.

Unfortunately, the rules are only available in german, but the core rules can be downloaded for free at the publisher's website (https://splittermond.de/bibliothek/downloads/) and maybe google translate can help you, if you don't speak german."

I don't listen to the kind of music Lizzo makes, so I cannot judge whether it is any good. She is a musician and should be judged on her musical accomplishments. Most of the stuff I read about her is not about her music, though. Which I find somewhat demeaning."

The AF gave up and once again, there is no danger of anyone twerking during the match."

fatlogic,f9tf9id,t1_f9rxqb5,1575621135.0,"It often had to do with taxes. In many places in Europe, property taxes were determined on the width of your house's streetfront. So you bought narrow, but very long plots of land. 
That is why - for example - Amsterdam's old city centre has these very narrow houses.
Or as another example, Prussia did this until the early 20th century. Hence Berlin's multi-courtyard housing-complexes."
