“But whatabout Obama’s phallangy policy, which also caused harm to thingamabobs and watchamacallits. Or did we forget? Go ahead. I’ll wait.”

So... the person replying isn’t even bothering to address Trump’s issues with phallangies. It’s not even being discussed now. Now we’re on to Obama’s.

I’m optimistic enough to think cooler heads would prevail. There’s a difference in Berkeley students throwing a violent tantrum because Milo was going to give a talk antithetical to their core sensibilities and Harris refusing to have him on because, as Harris once said, he just doesn’t think he has anything interesting to say. 

Sunlight is the best disinfectant. The best way to ensure shitty ideas and beliefs continue to promulgate is to force them underground and ignore it.

ABoringDystopia,felb6ny,t1_fel5cd6,1579218082.0,"It appears that Amazon donates far more to Democratic candidates and PACs than conservative ones (opensecrets.org). Considering that Democrats typically endorse taxing the wealthy, that seems antithetical to his alleged agenda of reducing the taxes he pays. 

Anyway, if the current tax structure and law allows him to pay less (or zero, evidently) in taxes, that’s an issue with the government, not Bezos. 

Finally, last I checked Amazon’s tax obligations were to the US government, not Australia. So I fail to see how fixing the tax structure would provide additional benefit to Australia and its firefighters. So yes, I’d say we should celebrate any charity provided by anyone, regardless of how they game the system (or in this case, just participate in a system that allows it to be gamed).

So I go to book a solo trip for my wife with all my miles, cause sheâ€™s got a girlâ€™s trip planned in Napa Valley, right? So Iâ€™m thinking sheâ€™ll get the complimentary upgrade, right? Totally doesnâ€™t apply to companions traveling alone. She doesnâ€™t even get to go to the SkyMiles Lounge."

Anytime the topic of donations comes up on Reddit, itâ€™s some contest in the Generosity Olympics where commenters get in some pissing match over how to best get rid of shit they donâ€™t need. Letâ€™s not overcomplicate the issue. If you have a way to offload shit you donâ€™t need, do it! 

This service is particularly helpful for people like me. I have shit to give away that sits in my closet for months because I live in a huge city, donâ€™t own a car, and have no convenient way of getting to my nearest donation shelter. So if you tell me I can reuse my boxes from my routine amazon shipments to offload it, and it costs me nothing, and I donâ€™t even have to fucking put on pants, then thatâ€™s amazing! Who gives a shit if Amazon gets a tax break. 

I swear, if I bet if I wrote that I actually give my stuff to the local shelter instead of Goodwill or the Salvation Army, someone would probably reply: wHy dOnâ€™t YoU JusT go FiNd a rAnDom poOr fAmIly to GiVe iT tO? DoNâ€™T yOu kNoW ShElTeRs aRe TeRriBlE fOr tHe EnViROnMeNt?!?!?!11"
