You’re not doing women any favors by acting like it’s normal, either."
GCdebatesQT,ffeznqy,t1_ffexrl4,1579871513.0,"330 is in the advanced range for women with a bodyweight of 230+. Do you have any idea how rare that is for a healthy woman? (Cause I assure you, it's not the obese women breaking lifting records). It's literally off the BMI chart if you're looking at healthy weight. It's at the high end of overweight for someone who's 6'2""--male or female.

My point is that you're over here talking like 330 is ""not even that impressive"" when 330 is elite, no bones about it. This is exactly the problem the OP was talking about when males start getting into conversations about female fitness."
GCdebatesQT,ffewx3e,t1_ffedjf1,1579868851.0,"Lmao “330 isn’t even that impressive” my ass. This is exactly why it’s a bad idea for trans women to talk about women’s fitness as though they know shit. If you watched a woman pull 330 on deadlift, you were watching an elite lifter.

Hell, just the other day I had to explain to a guy that the new Army Combat Fitness Test isn’t “easy” by any objective measure, it’s built to a benchmark of an average-to-bigger male and it’s gonna be difficult for anyone else. He was like “I’m sure you can do it!” And I had to explain that I’m in pretty good shape, but the test requires me to deadlift over 2x bodyweight for 3, and carry/drag my full bodyweight at top speed for 50m, twice, in the middle of other exercises, in 2 minutes, and that yes, I’m worried about being expected to pass that 6 months after giving birth. He had no response.

I have a higher than average strength to weight ratio, and when I was lifting every day with my guys (sometimes 2 a days) I struggled to hit bodyweight on bench. I would have felt like shit if I hadn’t looked up statistics and realized I was lifting at an intermediate level for females. Guys in general have no idea what’s a reasonable fitness level for women, and clearly many trans women don’t either."
