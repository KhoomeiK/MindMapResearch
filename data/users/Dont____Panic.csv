Instead, he might agree to revisit the issue in 1815.

But as I said, that situation has flipped back and forth several times, and even in a different way since at least 1998, when the Athlon came out to challenge the Pentium 4. Same deal there, Intel went with a long simpler pipeline to try to get clock speeds up and AMD targeted IPC with better speculative execution and faster caches.  The Athlon trounced the P4 because of that and Intel had to get lucky on one of their speculative designs out of Israel (Pentium M aka Core) to catch up."

bestof,ff1d2ga,t1_ff19eb2,1579477623.0,"I tend to see a lot of ill-informed opinions, but I am a person who tends to believe in some slightly conservative ideas at times, such as I believe in equal opportunity instead of equal outcomes. I also believe in the efficiency of competitive capital markets. 

Other ideas that would currently be considered “conservative” (but were traditionally liberal) is that overall productivity and cohesion of a society can sometimes be more important than any individuals particular feelings about a given topic. I believe that in the very long run, if we are to survive as a species, we may have to make some hard choices that may not be ideal for each and every individual. 

So you may be reasonable in pointing out that many conservative policies are detrimental to specific individuals. As far as what I understand of many of the more considered conservative positions, they’re genuinely held beliefs that people feel will better everyone, admitting that it is sometimes at the expense of some individuals (note, I don’t always agree with said opinions)

Sometimes (and often with specific hot-button issues), I think they’re wrong, but I refuse to categorically dismiss the fundamental concept of conservatism, and simply make the logical shortcut to call all conservatives evil. That’s an immature approach that may be cathartic, but it’s far from accurate. 

Of course, the argument goes both ways. 

I may spend more time around liberal people, so I may be biased in my life that I see way more hypocrisy from those arguments. Maybe if I spent more time in the “hurrr durrr libtards” crowd, I’d see it the other way, but standing on a hill and declaring yourself enlightened and the “others” ignorant cretins isn’t helping anyone and I actually find their beliefs often ***make sense*** and have a small amount of appeal, even when I choose to disagree with them in the short term. 

For example, I believe that our society exists on a knife edge of decorum and stability. Destabilizing cultural forces are dangerous to that. A pervasive flood of anti-education and anti-establishment arguments that are linked together is DANGEROUS to the long term stability of society and may lead to a new dark age.  I saw that shit in the tea party and in Palin Republicans, but I also see the same thing, possibly even more dangerous, at the core of many inner city cultural pressures and groups. 

I find the hard-core “small/no government” arguments to be a bit dangerous and something to be shunned, but find the “all in socialism” arguments to have the same level of danger.   But both groups seem to claim their opinion is the only one that is reasoned and correct and that the other side is just a vacuous, emotionally-manipulative bag of dicks with no more logic than said bag. 

But sometimes, there is a middle ground. For example, highly regulated free markets are a middle ground. Providing social benefits, but basing them only on programs that have research-backed positive outcomes, and cutting those that are prone to abused is another.

Sorry, I voted for both Obama and Justin Trudeau (and H Clinton). 

Also, your claim that YOUR opinion is “considered” and every other opinion is some ignorant “passing moment”, is so smugly immature it’s a bit sad. 

But remember if you decide to attack me, that we vote largely the same and I find the way you express your opinion shockingly immature.

I also find Trump (and Bernier in Canada) and their hard-line followers equally as obnoxious. 

Know that I likely agree with a lot of your political stances, but I think the far left is AT LEAST equally far down the “obnoxiously smug” line as the right.

This is good advice in general for dealing with retail or support staff. Getting angry at them just shows that you’re a bad person. They have little/no say in the issue and will often try to be as helpful as they’re allowed.
