relationships,febcqa2,t3_eoc68e,1578957544.0,"Girl, I hate saying this but have you guys had a conversation about even having the baby? Because thata could be what's blocking him rn. He could not be ready to be a father, and he might just want to not try hoping you'll leave him. 


Beside that it's not an overreaction, its completely understandable. As kids are expensive and take time and well every you have to raise. 

Ylu could give him ultimatums  but that's not gonna help. Honestly, your best bet is to have a conversation with him about this life you made. Whether you guys are ready to be parents, and if you both want to be. 

If he works fast food or in like a min wage retail tell him to ask for a mgt position. So he doesn't necessarily have to leave his job he will just get an upgrade.

And I hate say it but if he doesn't want to do anything. Then you might have to leave  and look to your  family for help. Or abort the child but that's completely your choice."

In a sense, talk less and smile more. You know listen and process what he says. Try not to jump the gun and dont over think it as that can get you guys hurt to."
relationship_advice,feaebo6,t3_eo9rkl,1578947604.0,"You might want to ask her about it and why she that feels about you. It seems like shes been hurt before and that shes fear full that your are indirectly distancing your self to find some new side piece.

Not all girls do this, I've seen it in girls and guys who have been burned before. So just work with her on it and show her that she is your and you are hers and that's not going to change ge anytime soon."

AskReddit,fe5t3za,t3_envww2,1578874349.0,"When I was 14-15 ish I played alot of halo and meet a girl over it. We started to ""date"" over a long distance. We skyped every night, we talked about everything. I mean everything from our dreams to our families. I knew everything about her, I truly loved her.

Well a few weeks passed where she had been really depressed, she wasn't talking to me about it . So I stopped trying to pry just telling her I was there for her and I loved her.  So at the end of the week she seemed happy. 

That night as we skyped and talked, she told me our dreams are only ever ment to be dreams. But she was going to see them for real, and soon. I didn't know what she ment. Well until she pulled up her dad's pistol. She held it to her head she claimed how much she loved me and how she'll be waiting for me. She held it right above her ear and pulled the trigger. Tell me all the while how she will miss me and how I was the best thing that ever happened to her.

I was crying, screaming for her to not telling her that I loved her telling her that itll be ok. But she pulled the trigger I watched  how her eyes glazed over. And how they slowly lost all of the remaining life in them. I watched as he mom ran in to the room  minutes later  crying asking me looking at me for a reason why........"
relationship_advice,fdhou8d,t3_elgh93,1578427184.0,"Nah, you have full right to ask bbn him to cut it off. But I'd have a conversation with him about it and about you guys.

Like sit him down just you and him after a good day of work. Tell him how you feel about him, tell him what he means to you and what you want from him. Dont hold back, and from there you can see what his response is and either tell him that you guys become a thing or you dont. But give him a chance to defend and talk about how he feels. Make sure he knows your on his side through and through. That your not gonna be like his ex's. 

Im sure you've already tried this and that you've been trying but its worth a shot."

https://www.helpguide.org/articles/abuse/domestic-violence-and-abuse.htm

https://www.thehotline.org/


These sites should have some more information on how you can help her.

But being a family you should be able to contact the hospital and tell them. They are mandatory reporters  they will log the information. Then contact her and the child, without the abuser around and see what's up. Then help her with the preceding events."
relationship_advice,fd3vruq,t3_ek0539,1578162067.0,"Ik that this is just a snap shot of the story but. It still sounds like you need to contact the police, or talk to the hospital staff about the situation. They have resources to help and keep her and their child safe. And will give her a place to stay and be safe when she looks to get away from him. But they can only help if she wants it.

And as a side note, it's ok to be saddened and angry about this. You have every right to be, but try to stay calm. Look to help the ones that need it  help break the cycle and get them out of their."
