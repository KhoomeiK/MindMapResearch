AskReddit,ffs45lu,t3_eutai7,1580172682.0,"To set the table, I never got that Trapper Keeper sponsorship, found myself shoving my school papers in my Jansport backpack.  Then mid junior year decided to throw the party of a teenage lifetime when my parents were out of town, but skipped a week of school (had a guy I worked with call the school saying he was my dad and that I was going to the funeral back east), whilst doing so.  The school finds out that I wasn't at the funeral, everyone's mad (legend status at school that year however) and failed me on those classes so I had to repeat the core ones in my senior year (thankfully I was on track to graduate early as I didn't dick off in the first couple years of high school).  Moved out of my parents house middle of my senior year and skipped some more school to work odd jobs to pay the rent.  Somehow my shitty paper stuffing practices saw me through to graduate...barely.  Skated professionally instead of college for a while, then went to school but dropped out a few times.  Never graduated. 

Fast forward to now, i'm self employed, run two businesses, and been a speaker at countless events mostly in North America, also a full time single dad. My mission is to add value to other people!  My organization skills aren't great, but my assistant is super organized so i'm good.  Just hire to cover your weaknesses and you're all set!"

Instead of being married to your thought of ""i can't be confident"" or ""I can't \_\_\_\_\_\_"" whatever the case is, replace that with ""who would I be without that thought?"".  Then flip your internal script, step up, and realize you have nothing to lose.  It's kind of like if you never ask, then the answer is already no.  Be the ball.  You got this!"
