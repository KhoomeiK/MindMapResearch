wow,ff8zgr1,t3_eresy9,1579700904.0,"It's only a week into patch and I'm finding myself struggling to find purpose. My guild fell apart so I'm not raiding right now.

The Vicious War recolor this season isn't doing it for me. I don't really want to do the Magni 8.3 intro questline again so I'm not messing with alts. I could level a Mechagnome but that would result in another world tour with Magni and they look absolutely hideous anyways pretty much no matter what I try to transmog on them.

My game right now revolves around killing rares and hoping mounts drop and doing horrific visions. Visions are fine. Mounts are gated to hell and back via being bound to specific assaults.

Unless I find a good hook within the next month I'm going to unsub after the yearly Love Rocket disappointment season."
crashteamracing,fey7sh9,t3_eqs3po,1579441903.0,The Wumpa coin stuff is just cosmetic. You can still have just as much fun as anyone else racing. Is the point of owning the game to play it or to unlock different tires?

borderlands3,feizgbu,t1_fegpxg7,1579151614.0,"It kind of works for Angel because the game leads you to believe she's something akin to an AI with her flat manner of speaking and the fact that she isn't presented to us physically until her arc is at an end. There isn't really anything to compare her to since you don't see her and then when you finally do she's only there as that in-game character model for a handful of moments.

You see a TON of Lilith and Tannis over the course of the games so your brain has registered what they're ""supposed"" to look like and then the live action actress pops up and it clashes against all the information you have in your mind."

So much has changed that I suggest you make a level 1 and tool around some and wait to use your boost. At least get a feel for what's changed. Do a couple dungeons. Do a couple battlegrounds. See what looks cool and go from there.

An educated guess on what to boost is better than a blind one.

wow,febjkfi,t1_fe9ytep,1578959481.0,"The Klaxxi being a thing establishes, though, that they can reject their queen and do something else despite being a sort of hive-minded race.

Playable Mantid will never happen in a million years but I don't think incompatible lore is a strong reason for that. They are a war driven race that doesn't even name their young until they have proven themselves in battle. That's the best in-universe justification any Allied Race would have for character creation (and thus, getting a name) at level 20.

They're basically wired to serve a monarch and do what is best for their people even if it directly results in their own deaths. I really like their special brand of zealotry and I'd like a ""darker"" minded race to play as."
SuicideWatch,fe2jyiw,t3_enkgaa,1578839289.0,"Last October my best friend died in a car accident.

But that was it.

We all just had to keep on keeping on. And now just bringing up his name makes people sad so...no one wants to. It's depressing beyond measure to see how easily the world moves on without us.

Obviously his death wasn't a suicide but he was taken from us far too young and I still miss him every day. If I died, I don't think people would be openly weeping or it would be a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but I do think more people would be quietly hurting about me the way I hurt over Jarret now.

wow,fdqqj5t,t1_fdqlyek,1578672727.0,"This is just me but I can accept things like Dark Iron as being a different race in the same way that we consider someone from Thailand to be of a different race than someone from Ireland. We're the same species, sure. But we do consider those to be separate races. The physical, natural adaptations of the species are different. That's not really up for debate.

A Mechagnome is not a characteristic of the species. This is like suggesting that I could cut my own legs off, tape blenders to myself, and declare myself Mechahuman. That isn't a thing. I'm still biologically exactly the same, there's simply less of me. This is not how race works.

The Highmountain have different physical adaptations than the regular Tauren. That's a race.

The brown orcs are a bit harder to argue because we know the change in their skin color to green is from demonic influence. But they are PHYSICALLY different.

Lightforged are a mess because they're simply stuffed with Light  and tattooed which are not actual physical changes to their species. It's more like they were charged like a battery. This one shouldn't be considered a new race either imo."

Life is heavy enough as it is without all the fakery of social media. I feel like I have to be fake at work because I deal with the public. I feel like I have to be fake on social media or else everyone will dismiss me. I have to be fake around my family or they treat me like shit.

The only time I feel like I'm me is when it's 2AM and everyone else is asleep and I don't have to do anything to appease anyone else. And it's cripplingly lonely being the real me.

Then corporate had to clarify all the reasons why most of us aren't getting them and those that were faced massive deductions for not being around for decades. Also they got rid of the people who had stuck around.

So corporate got an asston of money and the Republicans got to pat themselves on the back very loudly and publicly while those of us in the trenches just kept going ""Wait, what bonuses?"" Until the event had come and gone like a weak fart.

The fact that so many of my coworkers were directly jipped by an obvious PR stunt that gave us nothing is frustrating enough. But then they will argue with you that Trump and his crooks are the good guys. Imagine robbing yourself and defending your mugger."

She's been working with the jailer and is aware of the fate she's inflicting on her enemies. If they want her to be playing 4D chess and be a savior that's silly but it's also something she could have done through her position of power within the Horde just by bringing them into the knowledge of her Jailer relationship.

So, here's the thing. Baine is a good guy. But he is still my enemy and I don't super care about him enough to want to go free him from Sylvanas. And the culmination of the story involved my faction hiding on a distant hill watching Horde politics play out.

What are Genn and Tyrande doing? Tess? The Dwarf leadership council? Velen? How are the Gnomes reacting to having their king lost? What about all the Night Elf refugees? I feel like we could have had a cool heritage quest as the Night Elves come to terms with being without their ancestral Homeland but we got nothing. What are we doing about Gilneas now that Undercity no longer looks as a threat over it? Also nothing? Oh. Okay.

What is my faction doing? I don't know, because our story centers around Baine and Sylvanas. And then Saurfang and Sylvanas. And soon to be Bolvar and Sylvanas.

Like....there was a cutscene one time when I recruited the Kul'Tirans where I got to name a boat. That happened. Did that boat go anywhere or do anything? Did it fall down the big hole the Naga queen made? Was it ever mentioned again? I'm actually asking because I don't know.

Often even when it isn't actually flooded it's still super muddy and gross from runoff so you can kind of sink. The whole thing is a lawsuit out waiting to happen.

The other reason (and this is directly related to the water issue) is that it's a major problem running any sort of electric lighting system down in such an active, wet area. Anything we can't light up effectively isn't a super great place for tourists and doesn't make for good sightseeing or photography anyways.

Dr. Stone feels like every arc is a training arc which is......weird for a shonen anime but in a way that's kind of neat?

AskReddit,fcgin7g,t3_eh6tfh,1577640441.0,"It's not a building but I work for a company known for its cavern system and one of the coolest areas is a chamber that's a bit of a walk and about 15 feet further underground than the public gets to go. There's an absolutely huge, gorgeous column that's mostly white calcite, whereas most of the rest of our cavern formations are largely orange because iron oxide is a thing.

It's literally one of the tallest formations in the US but nobody ever gets to see it."
SuicideWatch,fcgfxuq,t1_fcgbiab,1577639556.0,"Most recently? Demon Slayer and Dr. Stone. Our office computers don't have sound so anything with sub titles can help get me through the day. 

Hopefully your heart situation will be manageable and it won't require surgery. I'm not exactly what one would call a person of faith but I do send my best wishes.

As for my friend, his complication is giving him trouble but he's in good hands. He will hopefully be okay after his surgery, it's just a matter of getting it scheduled. I've told him he's welcome to stay with us during his recovery but I doubt he will take the offer."
SuicideWatch,fcg847n,t1_fcg551f,1577637441.0,"Grateful for. Hmm. Well, right now I'm glad that the phones are so dead since there's no one else to help if I run into anything complicated. It's nice and warm in here, which is nice because previous to this I worked in a cavern system. I have a computer so I can piddle around on Amazon or watch something on Crunchyroll or whatever.

I don't want to pry or ask anything personal but your heart issue.....do you just need to take it easier on the ole heart or is it a major complication? I know a guy who is awaiting heart surgery currently because one of his cables is going bad and I worry about him every day. I do hope your situation doesn't give you too much trouble and that you enjoy your bath."
SuicideWatch,fcg3c2b,t1_fcg074r,1577636129.0,"Kind of, yes. Today is crazy because there's six desks in the office but I'm literally the only one here. No one has called any of the phone lines. It's like purgatory. I'm just packing around wishing I had a reason for being here and it's very stressful.

How does the day find you?

Edit: miscounted. I forgot someone was fired recently. There are eight desks but only one has someone sitting at it."
funny,fcfxwfy,t3_eh6fyj,1577634727.0,Oof. I feel this. Except my 2019 group is a hedgehog who is coming up on the end of his life. I'm going to lose it when he passes.

I can't focus on a single sound, I just hear everything around me at once and people have given me shit for not listening to them and I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I just can't filter noise. Am I just dumb?"

I would also accept a puppet show."

movies,fc5r0lc,t3_egby1u,1577464045.0,"Man, this bit in the closet freaked me out too. Also the notion that the girl I guess tried to hide from Samara in the closet and I can think of all kinds of ways that ended and none of them are pretty.

But you know what helped? The dude that does the Pitch Meeting series on YouTube does one about The Ring and it really took the bite out of that closet shot for me. Give it a watch, maybe it will help you like it did me."

Obama was president for a full eight years. Trump has eclipsed his golf time in less than one complete term.

Now who's wasting more time?"
crashteamracing,fc3nzy8,t1_fc3api9,1577394300.0,Oxide Station is the last one I need and I can't even unlock the ghost to race. I'm apparently awful at this track.
wow,fby6qtj,t3_eexwgy,1577209444.0,For me it's probably the Dark Iron Dwarves. The mole machine is cool and helps me immediately teleport to Blackrock Foundry once a week so I can go not get a mount faster. There's also a lot of cool fire weapons and armor pieces from over the years that suit a Dark Iron transmog nicely.
