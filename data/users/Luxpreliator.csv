It describes a hairy, [heavy-set](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight) (sometimes muscular) [gay](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual) or [bisexual](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexuality) man. A bear typically projects an image of rugged [masculinity](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masculinity). Some bears present a very masculine, over-the-top image of a ruggedly masculine man. These men may disdain or even shun hanging out with men who exhibit any trace of effeminacy (womanliness).[[1]](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_(gay_slang\)#cite_note-suresha-1) Bears often form clubs modeled on [biker](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle) clubs. Clubs are formed for bears to hang out with their own kind. These clubs may have [bylaws](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bylaw&action=edit&redlink=1), membership requirements, and charities the clubs support. They may host bear-related events such as ""Mr. Bear"" male [beauty contests](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_contest).
A younger (or younger looking) version of a bear is called a cub. A cub can be hairy or not. He typically has (but not always) a smaller frame. The term is sometimes used to imply the passive partner in a relationship.[[2]](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_(gay_slang\)#cite_note-The_Bear_Handbook-2) An ""otter"" is a slimmer or less hairy bear regardless of age.

I don't understand it, but way too many guys share those pictures.  Bragging rights or they are wanting me to share pictures with them is all I can come up with as a reason.

One guy sent me pictures and a video finger blasting his Gf from behind while she was in bondage gear.  ""Hey dude, I know you're in a dry spell, here is some pussy.""

My dad told me when I was in middle school that he loves it when his dick falls  out of a girls pussy and she grabs it to put it right back in.  We were talking about fishing and he decided that was an appropriate tangential story.

Another time he told me after a college swim meet he saw a girls bra strap had broken and her fly was unzipped.  He then suggested they, ""Shared a look,"" lustfully was his implication.  Also commented in her juggs. She was the high school daughter of another parent.  Some people just don't have respect for others.

You didn't do anything wrong and feeling betrayed is enough to feel sick about, but you didn't do anything wrong.

It sounds like in one of your replies that you're not dead set on breaking up yet.  That is up to you and what you think is right.  Assuming you and the BF patch things up and you don't send nudes anymore, the father will probably make things uncomfortable.  Father asks for more nudes, BF says you wont let him, father calls you a bitch behind your back, BF casually agrees, Findmyipad is a prude.  If it makes you uncomfortable to the point of vomiting you probably should move on.

The only men that consistently don't share nudes and the single guys, the guys with unattractive girls, or the men over 40.  PSA for all women, assume the pictures will be distributed.  It isn't right and I don't condone the behavior."
