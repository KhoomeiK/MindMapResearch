PointlessStories,femt25k,t3_epyhb7,1579268803.0,"I understand. I never felt real love until I was 47 and I did not know how to act either. He died and I thought it would never happen again.

But, I started seeing an old friend and it did happen again. 

In my case, I did not feel loved by my parents growing up and I did not feel like they were in love, so I do not have self confidence or a good love relationship model.

I am very insecure. If he seems to be pulling back for awhile, right away I think he is not loving me.

I think we are in different situations, but I think we both could use counseling. Counseling could help you find out why you are feeling so bad. I think talking (even just to a friend or writing) helps us figure things out.

I am really discovering the most about myself since I have been living alone for 3 years. I did not know I had so many issues!

I hope you figure out your issues and live happily ever after."
AskReddit,femrth4,t1_femhmun,1579267783.0,"I was lucky enough to have a great toddler who had only two tantrums. I was able to pick him up and leave each time. But, there are single mom’s that are struggling. Sometimes they just need to get groceries and it is just too hard to take the child out of the store every time they have a tantrum, especially if it happens a lot. Some have multiple kids / babies to worry about.

Tantrums just allow the child to get his anger out. Sometimes they just need that, which is why you might see mom’s “letting” their kids do it. It happens when the child is overwhelmed with emotion and does not know how to express it.

I think we should be compassionate. Most of the time the mom is embarrassed. 

Instead of judging her, maybe see if you can help her with anything. Maybe you can direct the child’s attention to something else or even give her a sympathetic glance to help her feel better. Remember, you will be leaving and not seeing the child anymore."

politics,feg9og4,t1_fefx5im,1579083784.0,"No, why do you think people voted for Trump? Not for his sparkling or moral  personality. They think he can get things done and he has gotten some things done. Record unemployment. He has addressed trade imbalances. He has tried to do something about every one of his promises . He wanted to do something about healthcare, but was convinced by Republicans it was not the right time. 

Not everything has worked out well, but he has tried to keep his promises. The mainstream media and the Democrats have been pounding on him ever since he has been elected. They have never just allowed him to do his job without being harassed. No, I don’t think he has done everything properly, but I think the Democrats have had it out for him from the beginning and were devising an excuse to impeach. Their “whistleblower” is nothing but another Democrat that wants him out. He is not a real whistleblower."

Adoption,fdptxwh,t3_emkspa,1578640354.0,"Yes. I have 4 older kids that I adopted, 2 had to wear pull-ups at night until an older age. My daughter adopted at 3 wore them until she was 12 and my daughter adopted at 9 wore them until age 10. The doctor says sometimes it is just like that.
They also have a biological brother adopted by different parents with the same problem.
So, I don’t know if it is genetic or because of trauma. Some kids just sleep too deeply to wake themselves up. There was another girl that had the same problem in my younger daughter’s Girl Scout troop and she was NOT adopted.

I am not going to lie - sleepovers were hard on her. She would have to sneak the pull-ups in her bag and wait until they were going to go to sleep and secretly put them on - hoping no one noticed the crinkling sound. It is good if she has an understanding friend that she can tell. One girl did point it out at a group sleepover and made her feel bad, but she got through it.

I could not allow my oldest daughter to attend sleepovers, so I do not have any experiences from her."

Their birth dad is available. He did not play much of a role in their upbringing. The oldest is in contact with him, but he hurt her badly. She has forgiven him, but the other two have not really wanted to see him much.

Adoption,fcb6sre,t3_egwx6a,1577583102.0,"As long as you are confident that you can keep the child safe, of course you should adopt!
There are so many that need homes and they do not care that your family is not perfect - as long as it is not abusive.
It sounds like you even have a husband, which is a plus!
Those kids have been through hell and just want a family for keeps. It was very hard on my adopted children because they were bounced around to different homes.
Please make sure they get attachment-based family therapy. The other kind is a waste of time for these kids. I can’t stress that enough. I wish I would have known that before my older kids got too old to help. We were able to help my youngest a little - but would have been able to help her more if we had gotten her in sooner.

Some have called my other daughter an Oreo for the same reason.

My third daughter had a black Big Sister. She gave her inappropriate music (for her age), scolded her for getting C’s even thought she worked damn hard for those C’s and actually committed suicide.

Also,  a black social worker illegally interferes in the adoption of our son and caused him great anguish because he thought we did not want to adopt him. She would have rather he live in a home that was previously declared abusive than be with us and his sisters. He is Black and they are Black & White.

They also have Black friends that are good friends and my daughter’s current partner is black. 

What you fail to mention is that many Black people don’t want to befriend white people. It is changing, but I experienced some real coldness coming from her extended family when we took them to visit.

The thing is - they are doing just fine. They don’t have any problem getting jobs or “surviving”

Adoption,fbxfopu,t1_fbwx3hz,1577185008.0,"I don’t necessarily think lack of “race relations” knowledge is a bad thing. I personally don’t think identity politics is helpful. From what I understand, black children born to black parents “warn” their children about white people treating them badly. I think this causes them to see racism where there isn’t any.

I adopted older kids - 3 transracial  (white/black) and 1 black. I did not even know to “warn” them. They are doing fine and don’t feel that they have been treated with racism.

Maybe  if we just let kids be kids, we would not have so many bitter black people that hate white people (which for some reason is not called racism). The relationships of black and white people are greatly improving  and you may be poisoning their minds with things that are no longer true."
Adoption,fbxehg5,t1_fbx526k,1577183126.0,"He must have experienced a different type of attachment therapy - the kind you see on CSI Special Victims Unit.

The type I am talking about is a type of family therapy. Parents attend counseling with the child.  At the beginning, with help from their parents, they create a timeline of their life. Some is good, some bad. This helps them understand their history. It also helps parents learn about the child. For instance, my daughter revealed that her previous foster mother locked her in her room for long periods of time . She would just give her cereal and leave her in there. She also spanked my daughter a lot. My daughter asked me to tell the foster care agency about the spankings - so I did.

After that, there is counseling based on attachment theory. I am talking about emotional attachment. Basically it helps parents and children to have a closer relationship and it did work.

Nobody is forced to be held against their will. I am sorry that your husband went through that."
