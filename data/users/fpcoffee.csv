teslamotors,fffxw04,t1_fffwlyy,1579894193.0,"Every article I've read always conflates voluntary and deliberate decisions to do business in China (happens), reverse engineering (happens everywhere, not just China), and outright IP theft (yes, there is some of that going on in China, as well as other countries, and  also the United States when it was going through its modernization period which was a longer time ago).

Do I think China can do better at IP rights protections? Yes. Do I think that some share of blame falls on the businesses who can't help their greed and choose to ""break into"" the Chinese market? Also yes.

But there's a lot of times where I just see some mouth breather on reddit post ""hurr durr china bad"" as a knee-jerk circle-jerk reflex without any real understanding of the issues."
teslamotors,fffvu90,t1_fffvmpl,1579892913.0,"I'm saying they're not ""stealing"" anything. They clearly state that  **as a requirement for doing business in China** they have to share their technology. There is no ""stealing"" happening.

nottheonion,ff3tfcp,t1_ff3s8og,1579548464.0,"If you type into a mortgage calculator what the [monthly payment for a $300,000](https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/?q=Vk2a-AKR) with 20% down (a $240,000 mortgage) house at current interest rate is, it comes to $1400 a month INCLUDING home insurance and property tax.

So, ok, it costs $300 more a month to own than to rent. But if you are smart about it, and choose a home in a good area where prices will appreciate, then your house value might appreciate 2-3% or more a year (gain about $6000-$9000 in value). Not to mention $4.5K per year of equity and growing. Also, the down payment immediately becomes equity, so you will get that money back if/when you decide to sell.

/u/thuglyfeyo isn't trying to bamboozle you or whatever... it really is worth it to look into owning real estate, especially if you plan on living in a house for 5+ years. You have to weigh *all of the benefits and all of the costs* in order for the calculations to make sense. You can't just look at your monthly cost because there're a lot of other variables that are in play here.

From a financial standpoint, home ownership is the most readily available way for most people to build wealth (positive net worth). The combination of equity and appreciation will usually have you  come out ahead in the medium-long term."
