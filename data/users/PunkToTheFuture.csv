AskReddit,ff8oxye,t1_ff8od4u,1579689612.0,"From my observations, people just want to talk about themselves. If you are listening politely and agreeing, you are validating the boring conversation. You can use physical cue's to show this. Eyes glazed over, half/insincere smile, body half turned/not facing person, no eye contact, nodding at wrong moments. If they get fussy about it just point out that you are trying to pay attention but it's just not your thing. If you are worried people will think you are self absorbed then you are wrong. Everyone else is self absorbed and the least they can do is talk about something you find interesting if they are going to go on a tangent. 

I'm not kidding when I say the most important lesson I have ever learned was told to me like this. 

""With every interaction, we teach other people how to treat us""

If I text you and you text back almost immediately, then you have taught me that I can get ahold of you whenever I want. If I text you and you text back the next day saying you where busy with no other explanation then I can conclude your time is important to you and my text wasn't a priority. 2 outcomes and the only difference was timing. EVERY interaction we are telling others what we expect from them. If you sit and listen politely you are just an ear to vent to and not a person to talk to. Be the person you want them to treat you as. It's really hard at first but please fake it till you make it. Standing up for yourself will change your life and incidentally make other people more sufferable."

Capitalism is great in the beginning stages because everyone benefits but the further on it gets the worse. More money begets more money and the supply is limited.
