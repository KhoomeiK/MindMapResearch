AskWomen,fezyr8m,t3_eqxs0f,1579463370.0,"Structure and boundries.  Taught me so, so much and made me into the woman I am. She taught me how to take care of things, told me she loved me a trillion times, hugged and kissed me and listened to me. She divorced my father when I was 10. He was a ragging ragging alcoholic.  I had a wonderful life growing up. I'm now 43, been married for 18 years and an RN."

I have no idea how old she is but when we got her, her poor nipples hung so low. She is a fabulous dog. So calm and behaved. I'm an RN at a rehab and often take her to work with me."
