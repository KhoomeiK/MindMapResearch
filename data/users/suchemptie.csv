witcher,fcnry93,t1_fcn8zvr,1577817287.0,"Nope. As a female, I can tell you it's much easier to appear older than it is to appear younger. When you are young, your skin is a smooth canvas, you can easily add years to your face with just shading and colors. In your 30s, lines and wrinkles start to appear and skin starts to loose its firmness, so you'd have to try and hide those signs of aging to look younger, and it is always easier to add than to take away.  Btw I don't know if it's a typo on your part, your statement  ""But the jump from 23 to 31 is more visible than 30 to 40 imho"" is true, but it pretty much supports what I was saying about easier to look older.

witcher,fcmyfqf,t1_fcmx868,1577797609.0,"Well that's the plan. And of course the show runners will be casting according to the planned number of seasons rather than what looks best for only 1 or 2 right.

Speaking of GoT, IMO I think towards the later seasons Arya was starting to loose that special spark and charisma she had when she was younger (not exactly sure if this conveys what I'm trying to say but I can't think of a better term at the moment).   Same with Bran, did not age well. I guess when you hire kids you can't always predict how their looks will change as they grow older."

witcher,fcmrg8y,t1_fcmqxnw,1577788570.0,"Exactly my point, I'm talking about the actress's real age. It's easier for them to make a 23 year old look 30 than a 38 year old (if they got a currently 30yr old actress, and by season 8 they'll be 38) to looked 30, especially if the person doesn't age well.  And since each season is at least 1 year apart, any aging in the actor/actress in the past year becomes really obvious. Case in point, I just watched the newest season of Orange is the New Black and man a lot of the girls look so much older than they did 1 or 2 seasons ago, even though only months have passed in the show."

witcher,fcmnmrk,t1_fcmmsbd,1577783147.0,"I think they deliberately found someone younger to account for 8 seasons (years) of aging. Probably easier to make someone look older with makeup rather than younger.

Edit: I’m getting a bunch of replies saying Yennefer doesn’t age. To clarify to these people, I’m referring to the actress’s real life age. Let’s say Yennefer’s appearance is about 30 years old throughout the entire show, in that case, it’s easier to make a 23 year old actress look 30 years old than it is to make a 38 year old actress (assuming she is cast when she’s 30, by the 8th season she’ll be 38) look 30.  The whole point is precisely to maintain Yennefer’s ageless appearance through the entire lifetime of the series."
