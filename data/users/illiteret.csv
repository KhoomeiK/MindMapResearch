OldSchoolCool,fesqwsu,t1_feroq3f,1579368058.0,I just read that in Hank Hill's voice.
ModelCars,feki2om,t1_fejxfnc,1579200492.0,Cool man! Thank you!
ModelCars,fejwmhb,t1_fejq42z,1579187534.0,"I was kind of teasing because you said the smudge wasn't the biggest problem I had and a drinking problem would be a much bigger problem than a smudged paint job. I was hoping nobody would notice the orange peeling. Yes, it was done with rattle cans and honestly it's the best paint job I've gotten using spray enamel. Then I smudged it during final assembly. I'm going to practice these polishing methods on a different car perfect before I hit this one. It was so close to being a good job. So close. I see the work that you guys post on here and then even more on Instagram I am trying to learn the keys to that kind of quality"
ModelCars,fejq064,t1_fejfl91,1579182891.0,"Thank you, I'll give it a shot!"

ModelCars,feiy2to,t1_feiviyf,1579150423.0,As in car wax?
ModelCars,feiutzo,t1_fe3bpyt,1579147815.0,"This is a hobby of both perfectionism and enthusiasm. It's very difficult to achieve perfection but we can't let that spoil enthusiasm. At the same time, I just had mega problems getting my last one into the home stretch, so I can totally relate."

ModelCars,fee219f,t1_fedz9p8,1579024758.0,"Thank you for the compliment! It's nice to hear especially with all of the amazing work people post. I did this one all in enamels. I haven't mastered brushing or airbrushing acrylics. I haven't amassed a full collection of basic blacks, silvers, white, reds, and blues in both acrylic and enamel paints so I use only one kind because of the incompatibilities."
todayilearned,fdz1guk,t1_fdx6dea,1578785742.0,"Under my employer's health plan, I pay extra monthly to have a $2,500 deductible (whereas most of my coworkers have a $5,000 deductible). I haven't gone to the doctor for any reason because it'll cost at least $250 just for going...two-weeks' groceries. I pay for the lower deductible so if i fall off my bike it doesn't cost more than the sum of my assets to get a bone set. It's ridiculous. My SO's employer doesn't even have a plan, she buys from the Marketplace and pays $400 cash per month ($17.50 an hour as a medical office administrator) for a $6,500 ded. She broke her foot walking the dogs. She paid the $6,500 plus the knee scooter and boot. I get that we have high risk lifestyles with the bicycling and dog walking but the expenses can and have been crushing. The US needs to pull it's head out of its greedy ass and remember that we're living beings that have a duty to take care of ourselves and one another."

TheWayWeWere,fdtkxnc,t3_en0xv2,1578718253.0,"I remember we had 4 extra students in class so we had to have four rotate out. We were back with the teacher and Nageli noticed on the teacher's control board that Roberta's speedometer was pegged at 140 mph. We were like ""Mr. Simmons, look at 'Berta!""

ModelCars,fc2k1k4,t3_efryw7,1577364208.0,Your details are truly amazing.
schnauzers,fc214rj,t3_efotte,1577336344.0,This demonstrates how powerful schnauzers are. And how smart they are how to use their center of gravity for power and leverage. Explains why either of my miniatures can yank me almost to the ground when we are walking and they find something they want to pay attention to.
