Monks were the ones copying down ancient Greek and Roman texts, although during the Early Middle Ages it wasn't done in great enough numbers to make a significant difference. 

To be fair, Islamic scholars were far better at preserving Greek manuscripts than Christian monks during this time."

Famously, Galileo was asked to write a book evenly comparing the geocentric and heliocentric theories by the Pope. The comparison was not even at all and quite insulting to the Pope, which is why he was tried for heresy - not because he supported heliocentrism, which he didn't even provide sufficient evidence for. These events have been largely misunderstood in modern times as the Catholic church being oppressive of knowledge."

However, children with more persistent and severe gender dysphoria in childhood, often find symptoms of gender dysphoria worsening as they become adolescents. In the case that dysphoria worsens during puberty, puberty blockers are administered, and if gender dysphoria continues to persist then sex hormones are given. 

There's no conspiracy here. When gender dysphoria persists from childhood into adolescence it will only continue to worsen in severity till adulthood."
