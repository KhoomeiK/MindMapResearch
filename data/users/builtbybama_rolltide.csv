lupus,ffeeago,t3_et6292,1579844799.0,"They might have been out of generic and subbed brand at the same cost as generic. My pharmacy will do that on occasion if it is the only way for a patient to get their needed medication.

Edit to add yes brand name is usually 3-4 times more expensive than a generic. I wouldn’t mention it this time but if it happens again I definitely would. It’s possible the new employee made a mistake and gave you the more expensive brand name on accident and could be fired for that even though it’s essentially the same drug just with a huge difference in cost. 

My migraine medicine is $1800 for 9 pills if I get brand name. Generic is right around $450 for the same 9 pills. With my insurance I pay $60 for the name brand and $10 for the generic. I always do generic. One time my pharmacy was out of the generic and I had a terrible migraine almost bad enough to go to the ER and they subbed the brand name for the generic and charged me for the generic. My pharmacist is the best! They literally ate almost $1400 to help me as a patient."
dogs,ffee5hj,t3_et5zro,1579844661.0,"I would definitely do a 2 week shutdown with a new rescue just to let them adjust to you, your other dog and a new home. It can be pretty traumatic for a rescue dog.  

Once you get through the initial 2 weeks then you can start gradually socializing the rescue with family and friends first, then other known and trusted dogs like a friend or family member’s dog. Trips to the pet store and walks in the park are also good to gauge their reaction to other dogs in a more controlled environment.

After about a month you should know if your new dog is dog park ready or not. If they aren’t that’s ok. Just keep working with them. Make sure during all this time you of course are still keeping with your current dog’s regular schedule so they don’t feel deprived or punished"
Eyebleach,ffedqqo,t1_ffectyr,1579844260.0,"That’s pretty common with the breed. My first English bulldog passed away at almost 13 and I rescued a 2nd one because I had such a positive experience with the breed. I don’t regret it. My second one is just as sweet, even tempered, mild mannered and goofy as my first one.

She might even accuse you of cheating with your ex because of this. There’s a lingering self doubt whenever a woman goes through something like this just like cheating. She’s going to feel like she’s not good enough, she hasn’t been good enough and always compare herself to another woman which is exactly what women who have been cheated on do. It’s going be an ugly process to try to fix this if you can even fix it at all."

Having those pictures is going to make a woman wonder if you still have feelings for your ex, if we’re good enough, etc. In our minds if you really over the relationship you would have gotten rid of everything especially pictures like that. We are going to wonder if every time we have sex are you thinking about her and always question where we compare to your ex. Good luck dude. She’s hurt, pissed and probably very insecure wallowing in self doubt. I can guarantee she’s already talked to her friends and they are telling her to get rid of you. If she does keep you around she will forever have nagging doubts of her own worthiness as a partner even if you get rid of the pictures and your relationship will never be the same. Almost as bad as her catching you cheating. She’s not going to trust you."

creepyencounters,ffd3y6a,t3_esz41h,1579812950.0,It’s very likely. I would call your non emergency police line and ask them to do some extra patrols by your house and let them know what’s going on in case your house is targeted. Our local news in Nashville did a story about this recently and said it was a sign that either your house was a good target or a not so good target.

If that was my mother or my granny work would have to wait because I would be at the hospital with her and then at her house with her until I was 100% confident she could be alone for the work day.

dogs,ff893ba,t3_es6ohu,1579669607.0,"Pet insurance literally is health insurance for your dog. If your dog is killed in an accident you would have to go after the responsible party in court.

Personal experience I had my English bulldog killed by my neighbors dog.  We sued her in court for the vet bills, his burial expenses, the cost of another bulldog, pain and suffering, emotional distress, my medical expenses ( I got attacked as well. I don’t recommend having a German Shepherd eat your arm) and my lost wages. The judge gave us every cent we asked for and then more because he hit her with punitive damages as well because she admitted she was on her phone not paying attention, knew her dog was dog aggressive and had tried to attack my dog 3 times prior and the fact she was an EMT and failed to render aid when she saw I was severely injured as well as my dog. She also admitted to paying the initial vet bill. Ultimately my dog never recovered and we had no more options left but euthanasia.  We were on our front porch enjoying our day and this happened. It was a nightmare and took a year to resolve. 

If you invest that kind of money you are doing it solely for your own enjoyment, your love for your dog and doing what you think is best for your dog. Pet insurance is worth it though. When Duke got attacked with all the treatment and surgery we had nearly 20k in bills. We only paid 2,700 of it. Pet insurance covered the rest. We would have been bankrupt trying to save him without it."
dogs,ff881al,t3_es6yn1,1579668668.0,Have you had his thyroid levels checked?

We both laughed about how we met the first time, he asked me to dinner properly that night and we’ve been together ever since. 

What we struggle with now is my intense schedule I work 60-70 hours a week and I’m exhausted all the time. He is self employed and has a very flexible schedule.  I on the other hand am very structured and over scheduled. We joke about saying I probably have my bathroom breaks scheduled. My typical day begins around 4-5 AM and doesn’t end until well after midnight so I’m scheduled to the hilt. My days off we make a priority to spend time together. We also make a point to cook dinner and eat together every night even if it’s late. 

You have to prioritize dating if that’s what you want. You also need to find someone that understands that in order to be successful in your career you are most likely going to be busy and accept that. My partner loves the fact that I am as successful as I am, how independent I am and values the fact that he knows I’m with him because I want to be not because I need to be. Even though he’s self employed I earn more than he does and he’s ok with that because he knows I’m doing it to make sure we will have a solid future with a paid off home and well funded retirement.  You have to prioritize time to find that person that accepts you the way you are and then once you do you have to prioritize time to nurture that relationship."
managers,ff2sqwy,t3_ehgto8,1579522560.0,"One thing that helped me be a better leader was humbling myself and listening to my staff, their concerns and their criticisms. By allowing them to see that I make mistakes too and acknowledging my own FU’s  I earned their respect. Another thing that helped me was never expecting or asking a staff member to do anything I wasn’t willing to do myself. I find leading by example to be very effective in motivating my team and also in building confidence in me as a leader. The bottom line is I figured out that treating my team how I would want to be treated if I was in their shoes has been the best policy."
talesfromcallcenters,ff2sfes,t1_ff2m4nb,1579522144.0,"I have a brindle English bulldog and people are terrified of him because they think he’s a pit bull. English bulldogs look nothing like pit bulls lol.  He’s the biggest goof you could ever meet and he’s the sweetest dog ever especially with babies and young children. He lets our 4 year old niece dress him up in a tiara and tutu for princess tea parties and lays so still the tiara doesn’t fall off. He guards my neighbor’s 3 little girls with his life and will herd them back home if they step out their yard. He’s dog and cat friendly and he loves people. 

That being said I volunteer with a pit rescue every week. I’ve seen the transformations of scared, abused dogs that seemed aggressive but honestly were just terrified from everything they have went through. Our trainer specializes in rehabilitation of fighting dogs and even worked with Michael Vick’s dogs. She also has started a program with inmates at our county jail to work with the dogs to help train certain pit bulls to be service dogs for disabled veterans. They are an amazing breed in the right home with proper training and socialization. I would trust a pit bull much more than a chihuahua that is statistically proven to bite more often than pit bulls but because their bite is so small it doesn’t get discussed."
talesfromcallcenters,ff2ru5v,t3_eqyxfm,1579521346.0,"Tell you what I’m more afraid of a chihuahua than a pit bull. I believe in the breed so much I volunteer every Sunday for a pit bull rescue. They are some of the sweetest, loving, loyal and intelligent dogs you could ever have in the right hands of a good owner. Any dog can be dangerous if treated poorly and abused. I got attacked by a Golden Retriever when I was 4 and had to have a skin graft on the left side of my face from it.  But nobody would ever expect a Golden to be aggressive but this one was. Sadly the Golden tested positive for rabies which is why it attacked me unprovoked(I was playing in my sandbox in our yard and wasn’t aware of the dog)and I had to go through rabies vaccines.  If that dog had been taken care of and not dumped off in the woods (we had a 5000 acre farm and our nearest neighbor was approx 5-7 miles away) it wouldn’t have gotten sick or attacked. Good job handling the Karen!"
confession,ff2qyq7,t3_erc2dd,1579520102.0,"You need to bite the bullet and take the consequences. That was a really shitty thing to do to someone that obviously really cares about you. The reason he’s not coming around is he’s afraid of you and what YOU are going to do. Not only have you jeopardized your relationship with him but every child in your family’s relationship with him. You need to apologize and tell him the truth. Hopefully, you can repair the damage but it might be too late. That’s a pretty severe form of manipulation and emotional abuse. I hope you find help and forgiveness

Edit to add: you need to tell your mom what you did and explain that’s why your uncle isn’t coming around. If she’s anything like me you won’t like the consequences but hopefully she will help mediate the situation between you and your uncle. Don’t expect to ever hang out with him alone for a good, long time.  He is going to need to rebuild his trust in you and see you have sincerely changed."

dogs,fevx3i7,t3_eqqmul,1579402575.0,"I wish I could hug you right now! My heart is breaking for you! I lost my beloved English bulldog in 2018 and I’m still not over it. I’m in my 30’s and a mom of a kiddo not much younger than you. I wish I could tell you the pain will end but you will always miss your dog. It does get easier to cope with and you learn to adapt to life without your dog. 

My best advice is to give yourself and your other dog time to grieve your loss. It will take time to process your loss. We waited almost a year before adopting another dog. He helped but he will never be the dog we lost. I love him but I still miss my other dog.  Only time will tell you when it’s right to get another dog."

dogs,fev6iyk,t3_eqoy0z,1579393664.0,"I have a Leavitt bulldog which breed out a lot of common health problems of the English bulldog. They are taller and longer which helps with the joint and spine issues that plague the breed. They also have a longer and wider muzzle which helps with the breathing issues that they face. I think in some breeds it’s a good thing in others not so much. For instance if I get another GSD I want a working dog for a guard dog. Obviously, a well trained guard dog that knows when to stand down and not aggressive to family, friends, strangers we meet at the park etc but if someone broke in I want my dog to put the fear of God unto them and pin them until police arrive."
