And the aftermarket 9 cell I got for it was even worse, at best it got me an hour and a halfish but within a year had degraded to 10 or 15 minutes. 


My guess is those battery packs had long since gone out of production by the time I ordered and the cheap batteries degraded just sitting on the shelf, which is likely to be a problem on any laptop that's more than a few years old."

No financing though? Having to sell to someone with cash means you could be waiting awhile when you go to sell it and it may be worth keeping until the value is low enough you can find a buyer who doesn't need it without too much trouble.

I've only had front plates (or at least properly mounted ones) on 2 of my cars in the years I've been driving around here. 

My old '90s Camaro? They'd swing a U turn through traffic for the missing plate in hopes of an easy ticket/bust/whatever. I got pulled over for it 7 or 8 times in that thing with the plate up on the dash over the years and it always went similarly when they realized there was nothing easy for them.
