SkincareAddiction,feztiyp,t3_e0ka9z,1579461464.0,"What about retinol cream? I been using it to help with the scarring. Thoughts on sulfur body wash? I have tried so much routine, and find that exfoliating is key to  minimizing KP. But this is great that you providing more in-depth info on KP—I definitely understand the cause behind it better! I just recently purchase sulfur/salicylic acid  combo body wash to exfoliate with, and then use the retinol cream to aid with discoloration etc. but now I want to add in AMlactin and Jojoba oil. 

I used AMlactin before but my skin was very irritated. But now that you mentioned to stay out of the sun, it’s probably why it happened! My biggest thing is the redness, it is so visible! 

Thanks for sharing this with us all!"
