Perhaps there could be some sort of system that helps cities become megahubs as people flock to them. There would need to be some kind of control measures to deal with housing and food demands of course, and maybe an extra use for citizens who are not working tiles. Perhaps some kind of unique buildings in the city centre, or further upgrades to neighbourhood districts, which could grow to support increased numbers of citizens or extend the range of workable tiles.

They were to take into account an individual's social background and familly set-up. Many issues would end up being treated for free, or from community savings schemes set-up for communities to support local healthcare for themselves, their families and other local people.

 In 1911 the National Insurance Act provided coverage for lower-paid workers and laborers. By 1936 over half the workforce was covered (the poorer workers).

ukpolitics,fdkyxd0,t1_fdkx6d7,1578514029.0,"The technology to store energy doesn't exist???? 

I think you've got seriously confused somewhere along the line here.  We are already storing substantial amounts of energy in lead acid batteries, lithium-ion batteries, redox flow batteries, hydroelectric pumped storage, flywheel energy storage, etc. 

As well as increasing upgrades in battery technology, scientists are also advancing the use of other methods such as thermal storage, liquid-air storage, methane storage (from biomass) and even a Californian trial of advanced-rail energy storage.

The problem isn't the energy storage technology right now, which is continuing to advance. The problem is the infrastructure, the availability, the regional projects. How is nuclear supposed to address these issues?

It is all or nothing. The climate crisis is an all or nothing job - there isn't a planet B. I don't know if you've noticed but it takes us 4 years to perform maintenance on Big Ben. Major nuclear investment would be an arduous and problematic process that I don't honestly believe could take us less than 15 years. It took 6 and a half years for Hinkley C to find investors and to be approved. Even now it's controversial because of energy security concerns. Add on 10 years for construction and the planet is already toast. Add on to that the fact that there isn't going to be a complete transition of the economy at least in the next 5 years, and probably until 2030 at least (because the current gov. aren't going to do that)  and you're stuck shovelling snow with a teaspoon.

The infrastructure is expanding but more investment into infrastructure is a necessity as we transition. The UK benefits from its natural geography, allowing for more constant capture of wind and tidal energy.

The current plan is for second-life battery pack storage centres in various regions. Spending 10 years and most of the budget building extra nuclear reactors doesn't provide this growing industry with a boost.

Whoever has fed you this drivel about long-term investment into nuclear power somehow saving us from a crisis that has already begun needs a reality check. The science says we need to act now, not in a decade. The strength of location means we have plenty of more immediate options."
