Cruise,fdhvywd,t3_el4ai5,1578431134.0,"I haven't seen the 6pm time for a very long time, not on their website and not on board.

The last time I was on board they still had a mention of shorts and tank tops not allowed in restaurants for dinner.  On the newest daily programs I saw online that seems to have disappeared and they only show the **suggested** dress code of the day. 

Shorts in the dining room might still push it a bit, depending on the ship and destination though. Other than dinner whatever day, time or suggested dress code shorts and t-shirts are perfectly okay."
shitcruisecriticsays,fdeifqz,t3_ekvxq8,1578339706.0,Whenever I cruise with NCL I always see  so many more staff member than kids grabbing a slice of pizza. I never thought of it as a proper lunch/dinner though. But going up there before they close the buffet as a break from drinking at the bars it actually isn't too bad.
fatlogic,fcwtk3a,t3_ej6o9x,1578037037.0,"I have disagreed with my doctor, went to a second one to get a second opinion or declined their medical suggestion when it was about something minor. I think that is fair as ultimately it is my body. 

But I would never even think of telling him or her how to do their job. How does anyone believe it can be a healthy doctor/patient relationship after pulling of such a stunt."
fatlogic,fcnrp6u,t3_ei5c6c,1577817153.0,"I never got this whole diet industry hate thing. Sure there are more than questionable companies, like everywhere, but there are not many areas where most is available for free (good nutritional information, youtube and healthy eating/fitness channels, reddit, ...), much is cheaper (clean eating, replacing expensive processed foods with healthier and cheaper unprocessed options) and the few things you might need are not as expensive (good running shoes, pair of dumbbells, pull-up bar, resistance bands, ...).

Instead of blaming the diet industry rather spread good and free information."
fatlogic,fcn2rmr,t3_ei2y94,1577801650.0,"One of those anti-diet dietitians that is bashing the evil money grabbing diet industry  and then...

* has a book to help people ~~for free~~ ... oh no you have to pay for every version including the digital one
* a $479 online course

WTF???"
Fitness,fcjoyq2,t3_ehjr7r,1577697332.0,"I think it depends a bit on what type of gym it is. Does it have a dedicated area for these kind of workouts? If yes absolutely go for it. For me the gym membership has helped tremendously to get into a routine and sticking to it.

After a while you might even feel like using the gym equipment, weights and machines, in addition to those workouts."
fatlogic,fcglk7q,t3_eh89po,1577641392.0,"That is the whole misconception behind this intuitive eating idea. It probably works well when all your choices always have been unprocessed natural foods. But nowadays we have stores full of products designed and researched to trigger our brains and emotions in a way to eat more of their products and more often. Now we need to understand the nutritional value of foods and know when something is appropriate for pleasure, how much and how often.

This is sad in a way but necessary reality. 

I take short time pleasure through milk chocolate and potato chips. I am not ruining my health and my life for short time pleasure anymore."
fatlogic,fcfp44o,t3_eh2rd7,1577632369.0,I tried to find more background information about that claim but when searching for it and studies proving/refuting the 50 or 60 year old study I only found hundreds of haes and anti-dieting articles. I can hardly believe there hasn't been studies refuting this claim as it is so out of reality.
fatlogic,fcfidqx,t3_eh6ews,1577630298.0,"It annoys me so much that every ""movement"" that has a good core idea gets ruined by crazy insane people. I really want to accept and support people who are obese and struggle but reading that bs by their most vocal representatives makes it really hard."
Fitness,fcdyqss,t3_eh3ali,1577615148.0,">And can we all agree to NOT be that person that complains non-stop about the ""extra crowded gym""?

Guilty of that. Will try to keep that in mind.

Other than that I am actually excited about everyone I see who works on themselves to get in better shape."
GYM,fc2d5fp,t1_fc2bdyj,1577353228.0,This. The gym here was running some 3 month free when signing up promotion around christmas time. Super annoying.
