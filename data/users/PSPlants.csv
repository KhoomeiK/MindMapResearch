Spray with hairspray and fool around with it. (This should help it fall more to the side/back versus on your forehead)"

MealPrepSunday,fesg1i5,t3_eqibia,1579364804.0,"1/2c diced, seasoned, & baked sweet potato (dash of olive oil, salt, pep, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder)

1/2c baked beets

1T goat cheese

1T candied walnuts (in a pan melt butter, add walnuts, stir then add a touch of maple syrup, brown slightly) 

Baked salmon (I just do a little olive oil, lemon, salt and pepper to keep it versatile incase I get tired of salads)

I heat everything but the cheese up, put it on salad mix,  top with cheese and balsamic vinaigrette."
