Capitalism,ffc3wd2,t1_ffc251g,1579790911.0,"Well that is just an ignorant comparison. The French and Russian revolutions were about rejecting and replacing a monarchy system of government. In a monarchy, you have the nobility and the peasants. Merchants were a step above nobles but still *far* below the nobility. While yes, there was drastic inequality between the noble and peasant class, that's where the comparison ends.

In our modern capitalistic democracies there is still wealth inequality yes, but there are no barriers to moving up the wealth ladder by your own efforts. You can be born a nobody and die rich in our society. That is markedly different from an absolute monarchy. Capitalism is not a zero sum game. Just because Bezos and Gates are billionaires does not mean that no one else can be. Everyone has a chance for success, no matter what station in life you start."

Wouldn't you want your man to do the same if the situation was reversed? Say something when your friends or classmates start up with this. Then tell your man what you did.

AskCulinary,ff76udv,t1_ff6bx5e,1579642274.0,"I disagree on home sushi being the same price as the sushi restaurants.  I'm a big dude and I can put away some sushi. My tab at a restaurant is regularly around $40 for just me. I have a couple Asian markets near my house where I can buy a couple sashimi grade tuna steaks and a salmon fillet for about $16 total. I have a big bag of calrose (short grain) rice, a tin of powdered wasabi, and a pack of nori (seaweed sheets) that all cost about $2 each and last for several sushi sessions. A tub of gari (pickled ginger) is about $2 as well. I also like to make miso soup with tofu and green onion, again $2 each, and miso paste lasts forever in the fridge. The dashi (fish broth flakes for miso soup) is probably the most expensive ingredient besides the raw fish itself, but that too lasts through several sessions.

So, sushi at home is mainly the fish ($16), some fresh gari ($2), a package of tofu ($2), pickled daikon radish ($2), a cucumber, avocado and a bunch of green onions (say $3). The rest I have on hand or only buy one at a time when I run out. That works out to about $25 for fresh ingredients that makes enough sushi for at least 4 people with leftovers, or enough for several days of food for a single person. No way can you get that much food for that price at a sushi restaurant.

I will concede my rice is not as perfect as the restaurant, but I've done sushi at home 10-15 times at least. I'm getting better each time. I'm confident I'll get close soon."

As OP commented, the only way we know of instant communication even in theory is through a wormhole, but even that will have some issues. Let's assume somone on earth wants to communicate with a ship traveling a significant fraction of light speed to another star.

How does it spin so fast? It used to be a massive star many times the size of our sun that probably spun relatively slowly. When that star ran out of fuel and blew up, the star's core remained behind and the spin increased by the conservation of angular momentum. 

If you spin around in a desk chair or bar stool with your arms out, you will spin slowly. When you pull your arms in you will spin much faster. Your mass hasn't changed, but the same energy that spun you slowly with your arms spread spins much faster when you take up less space.

If you really do believe that, you are not using your facts and logic.

As a conservative myself, I do not agree with your sentiment that a conservative will not help someone in need. I would argue that most conservatives are also religious, and church parishioners routinely try to help people. Many will happily roll up their sleeves and pitch in and try to help others directly. I have certainly done that when my friends have needed help. What I see from many of my liberal friends is they aren't content to wait for people to pitch in and help, they want the government to step in and make rules to force people to do something. Oftentimes the result is these new rules don't help at all and wind up doing more damage. Take homelessness for example. Many churches help fund and run homeless shelters and try to help people restart their lives and get off the street. The government solution is to pass ordinances allowing ""urban camping"" and make illegal drug safe-spaces and provide clean needles. These don't really help the homeless, it encourages it.

It is undeniable that temperatures have risen about 0.8 degrees Celsius since we started keeping track, but even 140 years is just a very tiny snapshot of a hugely complex and ever changing system. Technology has changed in that time, making our instruments ever more sensitive, and the very countryside has changed. For example, some temperature stations that used to be in the remote wilderness are now surrounded by concrete and urban sprawl. These changes will affect the readings and by extension the findings.

To state it clearly, I'm not saying the climate never changes, I'm saying it's always changing as it always has. Also, I don't disagree that man has an effect on the environment. We obviously do through deforestation, agricultural production and pollution. What I disagree with is that we are headed towards any kind of global catastrophe where we will destroy humanity and all life on Earth. 

We can't really know where we're going unless we know where we've been. Our empirical data goes back only 140 years, so how do we know what came before that? The science of paleoclimatology, which uses arctic ice cores, fossilized tree rings as well as geological data to estimate what temperatures were in the near to distant past. You could argue [this data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_temperature_record) are also just projections no different from the climate prediction models I disagree with, but at least this data is based on real, empirical evidence. It shows that the Earth has been both much hotter and much colder than it is today and all without any influence from mankind. Also, CO2 concentrations have been higher at colder temps and lower at warmer temperatures than it is today. [This graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_temperature_record#/media/File:EPICA_temperature_plot.svg) in particular shows that global temperatures were much hotter, by about 4 whole degrees, before the last glaciation about 130,000 years ago.

coolguides,fdf5oik,t1_fdf2uao,1578353887.0,"Look, I'm not trying to be argumentative here. There are a few differences between a regular open fire and the Swedish torch method. One of these is controlled air flow. Oxygen is one of the ingredients necessary for fire, and if your fire limits the amount of free oxygen flow, the fire burns more slowly. An open fire with no limits to airflow will always burn more quickly, I don't care how slowly you add wood. By bunching the split logs together, you control the airflow and control the speed of the burn. You don't have to make this out of one solid log, though you can. The fire burns from inside the ""log"" to the outside. eventually it will hollow out and the top will crumble in atop the flame, then the base will burn. Once made it is entirely automatic and self feeding. It all burns just fine leaving a pile of ash with very little waste. As far as trouble putting it out, you wouldn't really want to. My whole point has been I wanted our limited fuel to last as long as possible."
coolguides,fdf1cot,t1_fdeyv7t,1578351087.0,"You don't seem to understand. A well maintained fire, in my opinion, will burn through an open fire very quickly, like in an hour tops, likely less. I wanted the wood to burn in a controlled fashion to conserve the fuel and last hours. For kindling I just feathered the interior of the wood with a hatchet. This was a seriously picked over, fuel free park. If this design is too difficult for you, obviously don't use it. My point is there are definitely times when it is useful."

coolguides,fdew68s,t1_fdeslvz,1578347859.0,"Went camping once in a well-picked-over state park with one bundle of store-bought wood, about 8-9 small split pieces. I knew a regular fire would burn through our supply super quick and I wanted a fire to last several hours. So, we did the Swedish torch and a small amount of wood made heat and light for 4-5 hours. There's reasons to use that fire design, and fuel conservation is definitely one of them. I will admit, a chainsaw was probably used to cut the store-bought wood before it was split though."

Take Barack Obama for example. He was president for 8 years on the presidential salary of $400,000 a year (8x400,000=3,200,000). Yet, he just bought an [oceanfront house in Martha's Vineyard](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenhowley/2019/09/01/inside-the-obamas-new-marthas-vineyard-estate/#1046f0e72286) for nearly $15 million.
