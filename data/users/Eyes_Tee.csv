fatlogic,ffctgnb,t1_ffcszks,1579806916.0,"They never call the average woman slim. Honestly, this doesn't strike me as an infographic about health as much as just factoids about fat. You're right that health isn't really mentioned. I think thats because it wasn't meant to be a health guide"
fatlogic,ffcs3ke,t1_ffcrgin,1579806114.0,I feel like a lot of things posted here are just fine unless you assume the person responsible for it was a fat activist or HAES.
90dayfianceuncensored,ffbr6dv,t1_ffbi2ot,1579779492.0,"It's not as extreme as the biggest loser. If your TDEE is 3000 and you start eating 1500 calories and exercising every day, you'd easily lose 3-4 pounds a week. Morbidly obese people don't have to overdo it with restricting food and exercising to lose that kind of weight. There's a reason the doctor on my 600 lb life tells his patients to lose 50 lbs a month. It's because they're 600 pounds--the weight melts off, even if they're basically immobile.

I don't know, I feel like I see a difference. But we'll see."
90dayfianceuncensored,ff8s6f7,t1_ff8llqb,1579693996.0,"Maybe she was eating right and exercising, we don't really know. Besides, considering that a lot of her initial weight loss was probably water weight, an average less than of 7 pounds a week for two weeks is not unheard of for someone her size. Possible scenario: she lost 8 pounds the first week (mostly water) and 4 pounds the second week, and 2 pounds for the 4 days following. That rate of weight loss is not implausible for someone who starts out morbidly obese and isn't necessary likely to be muscle loss.

Regardless, if she's losing weight and making improvements I think we should be positive about that instead of making snide remarks about how 14 pounds isn't enough or speculating about her muscle loss."
comiccon,ff84h66,t3_eryyr2,1579665749.0,Some of the perks may be different from the sdcc landing page. Booked the DoubleTree through On Peak and noticed that they offered free internet and 50% off breakfast. The landing page says 50% off internet.
90DayFiance,ff5u5md,t1_ff1qchw,1579610345.0,"I said living off the land is weird for them because they're not self sufficient enough to pull it off. And while there are natural remedies that can help with health problems, everyone I've ever met that talks about ""natural medicine"" a lot are in some straight up bullshit."
90dayfianceuncensored,ff5ty9m,t1_ff44jr6,1579610136.0,14 pounds in 18 days ain't nothing to sneeze at. She does look much better than when she first appeared on TV.
fatlogic,fdvvidp,t1_fdv7611,1578751992.0,"Good as Hell is my jam. My go to ""I need a pick me up"" song."
AmItheAsshole,fdq3s0u,t1_fdpm8hk,1578653456.0,"They're not here. No one is talking to them. We haven't seen their house (and as other said, your description doesn't make it sound that bad). They may or may not need counseling. We wouldn't know. But that's beside the point.

People HAVE interacted with you. They've heard the story from your perspective and they've determined that the behavior you've exhibited here and the behavior you describe in the past is atypical and probably requires the help of a mental health expert. So GET HELP."
90DayFiance,fcj4ilr,t1_fcj2j3o,1577677081.0,Yeah it's confusing. TLC asked them to revisit an argument they had when they weren't mic'd up. So they did and it spiraled out of control to the point where even Tania thought she sounded crazy.
90DayFiance,fcj1v8e,t1_fcj1qxw,1577675198.0,"No, they asked if they needed to film the initial meet up at the airport again.

This is an argument that was apparently a re-creation of an earlier argument that spiraled out of control into its own crazy argument."
90DayFiance,fcj1oxn,t3_eh8nnu,1577675069.0,I'm so sick of Anna and Mursel. Nobody wants to see them sob over their doomed romance.
90DayFiance,fcj1fs9,t3_eh8nnu,1577674892.0,Don't wipe with the hotel sheets!
90DayFiance,fcj1cvc,t3_eh8nnu,1577674837.0,This is some teenage romance bullshit.
90DayFiance,fcj0bfm,t3_eh8nnu,1577674111.0,lol they're arguing but they still can't speak the same language. It's like listening to cavemen argue.
90DayFiance,fcj01kw,t3_eh8nnu,1577673922.0,"Sasha's ridiculous for throwing away the junk, but Emily and company trying to claim that it's totally healthy is ridiculous. ""She needs calories!"" She does but they don't have to come from Twinkies."
90DayFiance,fcizvl6,t3_eh8nnu,1577673808.0,I can't get enough of how huge Emily's baby is. Those cheeks!

90DayFiance,fcixdry,t1_fciwxyd,1577672096.0,Mursel knew. Anna just participated in the lying to Mursel's family. She actively denied having kids to them.

90DayFiance,fciwu38,t3_eh8nnu,1577671720.0,Anna told on herself on instagram--turns out she did lie to his family.
90DayFiance,fciwmip,t1_fciwfvq,1577671577.0,"I'd imagine it's like when you get rejected by someone you weren't interested in. Yeah, they didn't like him. But the fact that he's leaving because he/his family is ashamed of them still probably hurts. And they also probably don't like seeing their mom sad either."
90DayFiance,fciw8av,t3_eh8nnu,1577671303.0,"Anna doesn't really have to explain it to her kids, seeing as they let the kids in on the conversation in the first place."
90DayFiance,fcivyrc,t3_eh8nnu,1577671121.0,What opinion? All I heard was facts.

90DayFiance,fcitc8e,t3_eh8nnu,1577669324.0,Baby clearly took over the whole house. It's like that sometimes.
90DayFiance,fcit7nj,t3_eh8nnu,1577669237.0,Does she think that just tasting the food will make her fat? Will all the terribly unhealthy seasonings go straight to her hips?

90DayFiance,fcirftr,t3_eh8nnu,1577668049.0,He keeps saying his family is aggressive as if they're going to fly over to America and beat Anna and her kids.
90DayFiance,fcirdke,t3_eh8nnu,1577668005.0,This is not a conversation that requires the whole family.
90DayFiance,fbv485n,t3_eenvim,1577125153.0,"It bothers me that there are so many clips of her talking shit about him. I know that TLC can edit in storylines so I try to give people a little leeway but Tania seems so willing portray Syringe as reckless, naive, clingy, lazy and stupid. No where else on this show have I seen someone talk about their partner the way Tania talks about Syringe. If she thinks all these things about him, I don't know why she's with him."
