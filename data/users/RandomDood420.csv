Father tells me that ""correlation is not causation."" So I asked him, 'isn't T2D linked to being overweight? How can there not be causation?"" He told me (hedging his bets) that there is probably a factor that makes both weight gain and T2D happen, but it isn't weight gain that is the cause.

I pointed out that if there was a root cause of both, and that by successfully losing weight,  A2T goes into remission, so it doesn't really matter what the cause is. Both conditions are positively affected by IWL. He wouldn't hear of it.

Son starts aggressively CICO and doing moderate exercise. Loses 100 pounds in a year. And he's officially not pre-diabetic anymore.
