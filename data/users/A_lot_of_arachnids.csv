aww,fep0fts,t1_feowh0t,1579309366.0,"I definitely enjoy hearing about the coffee. How can a random stranger from the internet get ahold of said coffee?

And if it wouldn't be a bother or hurt to much, may I ask about your pooch? I'm definitely sure that I, and at least a few other internet strangers, would like to here the life your pooch lived. Sometimes for me to get over sad times is to talk about the good times before the sad event."

Mr Phil is a giant sack of shit. He literally shames people on tv for his own praise. Or uses people to make himself look better. Example you say. Remember that time he asked a guy how he specifically murdered his mom with a sledgehammer. Asking him how he raised the hammer and how he swung it at her head. What a wonderful person he is for having that broken and damaged person relive such a horrific memory on tv for the world to see.

unpopularopinion,fecdwqq,t1_febkfoo,1578971604.0,Absolutely not saying you are wrong. But growing up I've seen plenty of bullies that I knew for a fact had a good upbringing and a good life at home. Some people bully just because it makes them feel good. Some people just like having that power and the crowd behind them to cheer them on. But then again there are a lot of bullies from terrible backgrounds that don't the same thing. In the end is a bully is a bully no matter the upbringing.

videos,fbx4esl,t3_eenxq4,1577168903.0,I've never watched star wars. Not a single full scene ever. But I know all I need to know from tv shows and memes and literally everything else that has ever used star wars as a reference. It honestly wouldnt even be worth it to watch at this point. Same with lord of the rings and game of thrones.
