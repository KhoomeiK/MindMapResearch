BorderlinePDisorder,fck9r0y,t3_ehhrnq,1577720366.0,I gave mine up like 5 years ago. It was honestly the best thing I could do. I really don’t care what other people are doing that much and I don’t like having people in my business. Overall social media doesn’t seem like a very healthy habit anyways.

Nails,fc9j4ob,t1_fc9dz4i,1577553420.0,I got it done at the nail salon it’s black nail polish with the sparkly powder spread on top. I know they have nail polish like this on amazon. Just look up iridescent/ holographic nail polish.
