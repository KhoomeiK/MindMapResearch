To put that total points record into perspective: I was at the Blackhawks game last night and saw Patrick Kane get his 1,000th career point. Kane has been in the league since he was 19, and in 12 and a half seasons he has consistently been one of the best offensive players in the league, and also missed very few games due to injury. 

And yet, even for a player of Kane's caliber (or Crosby, Ovechkin, etc), it is not remotely possible that he could even come within striking distance of Gretzky. It is within the realm of possibility that Kane could have another 13 year stretch like the one that he just had and get to 2000 total points, but he would need to be playing at just as high of a level and stay healthy into this mid-40s. **And he'd STILL be 857 points short of Wayne.**

Unless the game undergoes massive changes and scoring dramatically increases, I don't think Gretzky's points record will ever be broken."

""White began her television career in 1939...*.""* 

*""*In 2019, White joined the voice cast of Pixar's *Toy Story 4*...""

So yeah, just your standard EIGHTY YEAR CAREER. And assuming she gets a credit this year (which I'm sure she will), her career will have spanned **TEN DECADES.**

She is an American treasure and a living legend."

news,fdo6t01,t1_fdlwr19,1578599892.0,"Big time. Now please for the love of god let's elect a new president. The oldest members of the court are RBG at 86 and Breyer at 81. I know they're both pretty spry, but there's a not insignificant possibility that neither of them would be able to make it through another Trump term. We could be staring down the barrel of a 7-2 conservative majority. Not great, Bob!"
todayilearned,fdklb2a,t1_fdjvlnv,1578505907.0,NO WAY REALLY!?!
worldnews,fdkkz0u,t1_fdkjacg,1578505726.0,"Yup. And I think it will extend beyond just Trump. Even if someone else wins the presidency this year, how the hell would the new president be able to ask Iran to comply with a new nuclear deal without getting laughed out of the room? Any semblance of detente between the two nations that existed prior to Trump is dead and gone."

AskReddit,fc5il4h,t1_fc598z4,1577458593.0,"Very, very important advice. I've gone to the gym semi-regularly for about 10 years and this is still the hardest thing for me. I would absolutely love to be able to do morning workouts because my job is such that I never really know how late I'll be working, sometimes done at 5, but often stuck in the office until 8. Morning workouts before work would be so much more convenient, but the fact is I am a terrible morning person. I KNOW from \*so much experience\* that I will get up and go for a few days (pretty much hating it the whole time), then one morning wake up after a not so great night of sleep, and my sleepy brain will tell me ""It's ok, you can just go tonight after work, go ahead and sleep an extra hour..."" And then I'll work late and decide to skip that day, and one day missed will turn into two days missed and on and on until I'm off the wagon. I always manage to get myself back into it but man it's tough to find that sweet spot where I know I can always get there consistently."

So the QBs on those teams have all managed to overcome a few dropped passes but Mitch....can't? Just seems like kind of a meaningless stat."
