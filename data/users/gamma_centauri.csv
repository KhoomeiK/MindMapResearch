The nurse says, ' i think that oral sex will bring her out of her coma.' so the nurse closes the cutains, and leaves the husband with his wife in the room.

Everyone always pushed me  from a very young age and  expected great things out of me.  To everyone's surprise but my own, I just simply broke during the middle of my junior year.  Long story short, I figured out I preferred working outdoors with my hands, but tended to overthink everything including the very articulation of my hands.  This led to many panic attacks, I had to learn to slow down and focus my attention on the exact moment I am in.  It wasn't easy overcoming the ""failure "" I ended up becoming.  Easier said than done, but I had to force myself to let go of what I thought I was, learn somethings about myself, and also learn how to proceed forward.
