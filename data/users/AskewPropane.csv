I’m not saying that it’s there in everyone and everyone should have kids. But I believe that having kids is going to be a positive experience for most people, just like, idk, marrying the opposite sex. Now, I for one am attracted to women AND men , so I very well may go off and marry a man; however, I can’t deny that on average there is a strong evolutionary drive for men to be attracted to women. If having kids sucked for most people the human race wouldn’t have survived, as people would just give up after baby %1"
