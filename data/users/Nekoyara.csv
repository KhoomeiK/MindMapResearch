relationship_advice,fdu0ltt,t3_en3qsh,1578725385.0,"My bf (31M) and I (28F) and I are both ""gamers"". He plays on a PC and I have mostly my ps4. I'm the bread winner and he's a stay at home right now so he games pretty much all day, alternating between casual and ""can't talk now"" modes. Sometimes we develop different sleep cycles because of gaming (mostly him) due to staying up for raids or events. We game in the same room and do things together like watch shows and go out but it can feel a little polarizing when you're both caught up in your own thing for so long. Sometimes when I feel like this I break out the coop games so we can at least play something together."

cats,fds22oa,t3_emxqjy,1578693149.0,My kitten does often! He does it at other creatures (squirrels and ducks in our apartment complex) and when my sister gives him the *bird*?!? Not sure why about the second one but it's consistent ü§∑

relationship_advice,fdrsozy,t1_fdrskxg,1578689109.0,I've been taking the Walgreens generic of 24 hour Allegra and sleep with my cat despite my allergy.
relationship_advice,fdrsi94,t3_emwu9s,1578688995.0,I'd offer her Allegra and let her make the decision. TBH she's behaving a little bit immature so if you give her the opportunity to make the choice at least you did your best. The mom visiting is temporary but your cats are your home.
cats,fdrp21r,t1_fdrotu9,1578687653.0,"If anything they also sell like hairball gel to help keep kitty intestines moving. We ended up having to give him soft food and mix miralax into his food for a bit but doing better!! Congrats on the new home, hope you and kitty enjoy (:"
Eyebleach,fdropqs,t3_emwdqn,1578687483.0,"Kittens suckling just gets me right in the feels. When my vet said to stop letting my kitten suckle my fingers I got so sad, but it was to help him transition to hard food"
cats,fdro4me,t3_emwfir,1578687266.0,"My cat's the same way but after a $1400 vet visit because he got a ball of hair stuck in his belly and started vomiting because he was constipated, we're a lot more careful about how often he licks my bfs beard or my hair, that I have to tie up in a bun more often."

povertyfinance,fdrcuj4,t3_emv26j,1578682632.0,Congratulations on the success. I hope you continue on this upward path in life!
tifu,fdrblaf,t3_emv6r2,1578682107.0,Tell her it's a misunderstanding. Fix the ass-hole on the horse and try to clean the stain. Hopefully they will understand it's your stuff and you want to keep it but good luck with them forgetting the mental images

wholesomememes,fdqysjv,t3_emtoc1,1578676965.0,28 and still sleep with a plush bunny my mom gave me for Easter years ago. My boyfriend moves it in the middle of the night sometimes but it has it's own spot on the bed
