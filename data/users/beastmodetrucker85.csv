atheism,ffhyr8z,t3_etibuk,1579959576.0,"Leaving them in the garden was definitely based on a bet between God and Satan. Satan just cheated a little. (Although this setup basically made them well kept prisoners so maybe God cheated)

GOD: Even without omnipotent power we would be great. 

SATAN: I bet if you made some mortals in our image they would do terrible things wherever they go.

GOD: Bet! I will create a world and give them everything they will ever need so they will never be bad!

SATAN: Well give them a chance to be bad put an apple tree in the garden and tell them they CANNOT eat from it.

GOD: You're on!"
