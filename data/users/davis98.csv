books,ffqlcwo,t1_ffqkwih,1580137703.0,"In that case I’d recommend “The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.” It’s one of his shortest novels. It’s about a little girl that gets lost in the woods while on a walk with her family, and accidentally walks deeper and deeper. She has to survive using only what’s in her backpack and her natural instincts, but she slowly realizes that she can no longer trust her own mind. Amazing book that doesn’t get much attention."

Where Jack’s meeting doomed him, Danny’s led to him finding a purpose in life and helping others. Also, both interviews would land them in places surrounded by death. Jack would be overtaken by the death that surrounded him, and Danny would help others move on peacefully into the afterlife."

911FOX,ffecasl,t1_ffeb3b0,1579842894.0,Any specific examples of the show teasing a relationship? I’m pretty gay but I’ve never caught vibes from them. I’ve always seen a strong friendship but never really sensed sexual tension
911FOX,ffeatxa,t1_ffealn9,1579841563.0,"Not disagreeing with that, but at this point making the characters gay would always feel like fan service. Maybe it wouldn’t had they started a relationship earlier, but at this point the writers and producers have been endlessly harassed over this issue. Giving in to fan demand at this point would just leave a bad taste in my mouth, although I completely understand that it would satisfy a lot of viewers."
911FOX,ffead0z,t1_ff8e1q7,1579841153.0,I just think it’s noteworthy that neither character has even hinted at being gay or bi. I think the inclusion of gay characters should happen naturally instead of turning straight characters gay due to fan demand
TheOutsider,ffe8cb0,t1_ff8z9ui,1579839461.0,"True detective season 1 definitely has a similar vibe, as does season 3. And I have seen doctor sleep! I was one of the five people that paid to see it in theaters. I loved it"
