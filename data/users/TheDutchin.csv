> where do people get off writing these wiki articles

Is that all you have to say on that?  It doesn't seem odd to you that decades prior to the first genetics test we were able to determine and change the racial makeup of an entire country with the stroke of a judge's pen, overnight?  How, exactly, does that fit into your outlook?

> what's the problem with breeding out all the jews

Nothing, because you can't, and even if you could, the method being implied (letting them live their lives freely and unmolested, but they mix their genes with non-jews) doesn't sound bad.

> just admit some races are smarter on average

They are, but not due to genetic factors.  If it were because of their genes, that sub saharan African wouldn't have scored 68 in the year 2015, because 68 in the year 2015 means hes a few standard deviations more intelligent than the white kids scoring around 100 in the 60's.  

> you literally just pontificated why it wouldnt matter

If I waxed poetic about how insignificant it would be for a tree to fall in the woods on it's own, would that make you think I'm planning on cutting the tree down?  The question I find myself repeatedly asking you is: how does one lead to the other here?  

> youd freak out

Only because you seem to have a strict definition of black people, and I doubt that youd be referring to letting them freely intermix with whomever wishes to intermix with them so that generations from now the classification becomes largely meaningless.  *If* that was what you meant then yeah, that's cool, no problem there.

> telling dumb people they're smart doesnt help them it just fucks everyone

Who's doing that?  Did you not read the Flynn Effect article I linked you?  Are you assuming I'm out here advocating we treat every individual as equally intelligent?  Because I'm not.  But every group, as noted and proven by the Flynn Effect, is capable of producing 'smart' individuals."
MemeEconomy,ff20gf5,t1_ff1vnm9,1579490510.0,"How do those not follow.

Premise one: Race is mostly a social construct.  Even Finnish people weren't considered white until [1908](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_whiteness_in_the_United_States), prior to that they were classified as Asian.  Nothing of their phenotype changed in 1908, but the classification, because it is not based on genetics, was able to.

Premise two: there would be no problem if this classification were to change.  What *would* the problem be, exactly?  To use a statistic stonetoss alludes to, the Bell Curve, or, intelligence plotted along racial lines.  Intelligence (a dubious thing to measure to begin with) is more closely correlated with environmental factors, such as nutrition and the quality of education, for example.  Coupled with the [Flynn Effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect), it appears that non whites are just as genetically capable of reaching the same intellectual level as whites.  The average non white kid, raised in the same manner as he was today, but testing against white kids of the 60's, 70' 80's etc, would crush the field.

Conclusion: nobody says with people are going to stop existing, but as a social construct the definition is capable of, and therefore inevitably will, change.  That's okay, because it isn't a particularly useful predictor of many other genetic traits beyond melanin content in the skin (note I did not say all)."
