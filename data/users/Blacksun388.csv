AskReddit,fgnvfv2,t3_ezewgo,1580953766.0,"It was a time where I was at my lowest shitiest unemployed and emotionally unstable point. I got into an argument with my parents because they wanted me home by a certain time and I intentionally took their “be home by [time]” as a suggestion. I was in college. I know how to manage myself. 

My dad at that point was fond of the phrase “I brought you into this world and I can take you out of it”, which is honestly still a stupid phrase in my opinion. But he said it that night and I couldn’t take it anymore. So I grabbed the shotgun from my closet and loaded it (yes, a depressed man who owns a gun. How could that possibly go wrong?) slammed it on the table in front of both my parents, and dared him to “take me out of it”.  Because I was tired of hearing that stupid phrase and I was tired of feeling like my life was going nowhere.  I did not give an inch in that shouting match between my dad and I. 

But eventually I unloaded it and took it back to my room and cried. My mom woke me up at 1 am to talk to me the next morning and we both had coffee and spoke about what happened. I never saw her more afraid and broken than that night. That’s about when I started seeking help for my problems. I’ve gotten a lot better since then, dad never says to me anymore, and I’ve forgiven both of them and they forgave me. No police were called even though I thought they might. Still it was pretty traumatic for all of us and I deeply regretted it ever since."

CasualConversation,fgi0tzk,t3_ey21yx,1580800486.0,This is a solid and healthy way to talk about relationships with your children. Non-judgmental and non-confrontational. Guide and protect them yes but at the same time allow them to make their own experiences and teach them how to be a good partner to their significant other. They’ll really appreciate and I’m glad my parents decided to not make a big deal of it when I found someone I really liked at that age.

MrRobot,fgg71pt,t3_ey7c3v,1580755636.0,The cinematography works because it emphasizes distance between characters physically and mentally. Sometimes they can appear uncomfortably close or on opposite sides of a frame to make a point about their relationship to each other. It inspires smallness or claustrophobia that can come along with paranoia and distrust of other people. Also it emphasizes how small they are compared to their general environment especially in the face of the monolithic E-Corp settings.

explainlikeimfive,fg5nqf0,t3_etqfkh,1580532663.0,"Phones now are just computers that fit into your hand. They have software, firmware, operating systems, applications, and hardware that can be exposed in a variety of different methods. Some of the most common methods doing this involve the user downloading infected files or applications, weak or non-existent application security that can be exploited, connecting to a malicious system via usb, or operating system bugs that can be exploited before they are discovered and patched.

As for Bezos? He downloaded an infected mp4 file. We’re only human. Even people who have years of knowledge and experience slip up sometimes."
