Most of these movies and shows were very successful outside the ravenous bubble of prequel worship that exists on reddit. They brought up Marvel. My point to them wasn't that marvel movies were panned, it was that not everything was perfect from the beginning as they were scting like.

What I will say, tbough, is you'd be surprised at how much fat you can change the appearance of, especially as you start to build muscle. You won't be able to spot burn fat, but larger abdominal and core muscles will help with the way it looks. Additional upper body muscle will change the visual lines as well; I used to have a ton more muscle and belly fat wasn't as noticable. As I'lve gotten smaller, I actually look fatter with *less* bodyfat than I had before, because my chest and shouldefs have shrunk."
