There is none. All gun control is infringement. But should have thought about that more than 90 years ago. Now its basically damage control, and trying to figure out what will actually work. 

>Also neither .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 are ""of a high caliber""

Never said they were. In fact i said they were varmint rounds. But any semi auto gun firing those is getting banned when they renew the assault weapons ban. So i was not really thinking about them having ammo limits."
progun,fgmilod,t1_fgmakpz,1580925306.0,"Its not a registry. It just requires background checks for private sales. That is what a universal background check is. 

When they record sales, they are already recording a sale anytime you buy from a store. Those receipts don't get deleted you know. And they keep track of  every time the database is accessed for the background checks, and for who. 

I mean seriously there is no privacy in this country anymore. 

They record all information they can possibly get their hands on. Data is constantly being collected. 

If you carry your phone around with you. They know everything they could possibly want to know about you. They know how many guns you have. They know when you take a shit, and for how long for fucks sakes. 

The universal background check would only have one purpose. Which is to force the people that sold guns to anyone to go in to get a background check for the sale. 

I have literally witnessed violent felons getting weapons from private citizens like this to avoid a background check. 

It is only a minor inconvenience for something that would actually work. Compared to all the other bullshit that has been passed.

I mean the people that are selling their guns to criminals. I doubt they are purposely doing it. Its most likely just them not giving a fuck on who they sell to. Like if they put a gun on craigslist or something. The guy shows up, buys the gun without a background check. The owner doesn't know what the fuck they are going to use that gun for. 

There is a devil may care attitude about the whole thing. Me, and a lot of my acquaintances, make sure to always sale to people with weapons carry permits. Because of the stuff you have to go through to get one it is usually a safe bet.

But a lot people don't even bother."
progun,fgmgct7,t1_fgmawxo,1580923986.0,"It would effect me to lol. I would not condone anything i wouldn't do myself.

Like i said before. Why the fuck y'all draw a line in the sand on this one. This one actually has actual feasibility. 

Most gun control is bullshit. Truthfully gun control is all infringement on our rights. 

But we should have done something about it more than 90 years ago. The first gun control law that was not eventually overturned was in 1927. https://www.thoughtco.com/us-gun-control-timeline-3963620

Basically the american people allow a million gun control laws to pass, and do nothing about it.

Then when it finally gets to something that would actually work it is suddenly to much?

Like i am honestly not pro gun control AT ALL! But the time where that stuff will be reversed without a literal overthrowing of the government is over. 

There is no going back without bloodshed. That is not how government works. They can only add more legislation. 

I like this one because it actually does close up a security gap. Unlike most of this shit that is security theater. Which means it is supposed to make you feel safe but actually doesn't do anything at all. 

I have personally seen violent felons get guns without background checks like this. 

The thing is, right now a lot of us in the gun lover community use weapons carry permits as proof that someone is safe to sale to. But a lot of people will just sale to anyone. This is dangerous. 

The thing is. What i want is actually pretty  different. What i have always wanted (besides no gun control at all) was a licensing system. I want a compromise from both sides. The pro gun side. Would be required to get a gun license. By taking safety courses,and tests. Then getting a background check, and fingerprinted. Like what is required for all weapons carry permits. Then get a mental check. That is the one everyone balks at. But it is probably one of the best ways to stop a lot of the shootings with the mentally ill shooters. So pretty much all school shooters. Now here is the kicker. The reason it will never work. Because in exchange for going through a licensing system. I want the anti gun crowd to drop all other gun control. Including the nfa. Allowing us to own all types of firearms. No restrictions except for the license. The license would also double as a concealed carry permit. It would also be used in private sales. I want to make it illegal to sale to anyone without that license. Its the best compromise we could ever achieve. Because it actually would make a significant difference. Unlike 90 percent of the stuff we have now.

I don't even give a fuck if you think im a gun owner or not. I would say ask me questions about guns that any gun owner would know. But you know everyone has google now. So yeah i only have 3 guns right now. P220 8 round 45. 12 gage pardner 5 round tube mag, and browning 1911 22 10 round. But i mean damn its not my fault you have not had much experience with guns. Even the famous 10/22 one of the most popular guns in the country comes standard with 10 round rotary magazines. 

The real funny thing is i have owned more than twenty guns. So that i can take them apart and figure out they work. So i can be better at fucking gunsmithing.

But honestly this entire conversation is hypothetical. Bernie is never getting elected. Trump is guaranteed to win this election. Which he will most likely pass the assault weapons, ban. 

Y'all are so focused on labels, and bullshit that no one notices the truth of the whole matter. The elections are rigged, and presidents are pretty much pre selected.

>handicapped by an out-of-touch legislator who lives in a safe, suburban neighborhood full of mansions, and who's never owned a gun in his life.

 Trump does own guns but not everyone that owns guns is pro second amendment, or pro poor people owning guns. Trump is a pretty good politician. He knows who his supporters are, and what to say to get what he wants.

But he let his hand slip when he condoned taking guns away from people without due process in support of red flag laws. 

And he renewed the patriot act again. I don't trust him as far as i can throw him, and neither should the american people. 

If bernie were elected, he would most likely get rid of the patriot act, the assault weapons ban would be passed, but that is going to happen with trump anyways. He would most likely be blocked on every other anti gun thing he tries to pass.

>What type of person that has owned all types of pistols, handguns and rifles rents a .22 from the range? 

I didn't say I owned every type. I sayed I owned like 20 guns.  Rifles, shotguns, pistols, and hand guns. The reason i tried that gun out at the range. Was just to see what those types of guns are like. A very specific type of gun. A knock off of the bigger version. They have 22 versions of lots of famous guns. One of my favorites was the H&K MP5k. But i much rather the real ones. I cut down a lot. So now my only knock off 22 that i have is the browning m1911 22. Its pretty fun. 

Sorry but I am very progun. Im just tired of the bullshit. Either y'all  can get off your asses and start the revolution now. Or you have to fucking deal with shit like this. 

Honestly I  was more or less playing devils advocate. Trying to find the good in the bad. Bernie he is a pretty honest person, unlike literally every other politician except maybe yang. I think he would make a good president. But the chances of him getting elected are extremely low. 

Mostly because the shits rigged to begin with. He was supposed to be the dem candidate last election but got fucked over by hillary. That is the main reason i trust him. 

Bernie has actual good ideas, especially about mental health. He realizes unlike the other stupid mother fuckers on the left that people kill people, not guns. If he actually got elected he would be blocked on every gun bill except the assault weapons ban. Im sorry to tell you, but that's part of their plan now. 

Its most likely gonna be trump that passes it next term, because he is pretty much guaranteed to win. My entire comment was mostly to say rogan was not wrong for endorsing bernie. And no neither of them are anti gun. Just because you support gun legislation does not make you anti gun. It makes you thinking human being that is trying to find a solution to a problem.

All those guns have more rounds because it takes a lot more them to put anything down. Hell an AR-15s 556 round is considered a varmint round. I carry a Sig P220 with hollow points for my CCW. 

Besides your missing the part where i said he will never get the magazine 10 round capacity law passed. To many people against laws like that in congress.

>Bernie is way more anti gun.

No not really. He says anything over ten rounds. Ten rounds is about as standard as it gets when it comes to civilian guns.

I read his policies just now, and out of all the democrats his is the least insane except for maybe Yang's. But there is no way in hell yang is going to get into office. Bernie might pull off some miracle.

I am pro gun as hell but I agree with most of what bernie says on guns. Except for banning of 'assault' weapons, and high capacity magazines. But I mean its not like he will be able to get those passed. 

Other than those i have not read anything actually bad. Most of his ideas are actual common sense. Like we should definitely require background checks for all gun purchases. Not just the ones we get from shops. I have already personally seen violent criminals getting guns from private citizens. 

Me personally, I only sale to people with concealed carry permits. But not everyone does that. As far as I can tell background checks are not that bad, and I have not read or heard anything about a gun registry from bernie. 

We already deal with background checks for private sales when buying online. Since it is illegal to have an actual gun shipped to your house. So they must be sent to a certified gun dealer so they can do the background check for the gun. So it is already a very simple matter. 

Meanwhile Trump openly endorsed red flag gun laws, and actually said that people should have their guns taken away without due process. So what the fuck. Bernie actually acknowledges the truth about mass shooters, and school shooters. He wants to make the mental health care in America better. To combat this problem. Which I honestly believe it would have an effect. 

I have always held to the belief that guns don't kill people, people kill people. Better mental healthcare would definitely help with this. Im tired of every other fucking country making fun of the school shootings in America. Even our own fucking citizens do it. Its fucking disgraceful.

Plus the way things are going, trumps probably gonna pass an 'assault' weapons ban anyways. Most civilian guns wont even be effected by the ban on any magazine over ten rounds. Quite honestly 10 rounds of a high caliber round is good enough to handle pretty much any situation. Even fighting off an army of police, the military, shooting armies of wild boar or whatever else. If you need something more than that. You might as well just get a belt fed. Because honestly those drums are stupid as fuck. Im pretty sure no actual military force uses drum magazines anymore. I think they used to be used on the Russian PPSh-4, or the  DP-2( also russian). I wonder if belt fed counts as a magazine over ten round lol. 

I have owned like 20 guns. Rifles, handguns, pistols, and shotguns. None of them have ever held more than ten rounds. Except for the 13 round magazines i bought for my 1911s which were honestly garbage. The magazines not the 1911s lol. Hell even the AR-15 22 that i rented at a gun range to try out came with standard 10 round magazines. So i don't know what you mean by banning standard magazines."

All though I'm pretty sure it affects you worse than most people. Because a lot of times the ones that are affected the most by negativity from others are first to throw negativity at others as sort of defense mechanism. 

But yes most people can go out into the world perfectly fine while dealing with negativity. Most people are affected by mean words though. And that was your definition of a snowflake. So by your definition of a snowflake, everyone including you is a snowflake. 

The reason people are able to go out into the world despite dealing with negativity on a daily basis while largely ignoring it. Is because we slowly get used to it over time. Sort of a social immune system. Like if you call a small child a mean name they might go off into a corner and cry. But some kids respond in anger. Social immunity means you can eventually just ignore it. But even if you ignore it, it still affects you on some level. It is largely do to to humans being very social creatures driven by the approval of others. 

I was actually the type of kid to get into a lot of fights when insulted.  But i grew to the point where i just ignore most things. But there are certain things that get to me. Not what is said but how it is said, and from whom.

Presidents have failed to be impeached with the abuse of power charge to. I think trump is actually the first not only to go to trial for two articles of impeachment, but also on obstruction of congress charge to. Even though that is technically the presidents job. 

This is guaranteed to fail. Just because the ravenous crazy leftists managed to stick something after throwing blindly, does not mean he will be put out of office. Which is unfortunate actually.

unpopularopinion,fg4wj9j,t3_ewrfv1,1580512678.0,"Nah. I don't think so. Basically the differences between the boomers, and millennials are more different than any other generation in human history. Sure there might be some hate between future generations. But it will be no where near as bad as the rift between boomers, and millennials. 

Boomers are literally the most privileged generation as a whole in the history of human civilization. Sure not every boomer was rich. But even the poorest boomer was richer than the vast majority of  millennials today. 

By the actual stats. By the time boomers were the same age as millennials, they owned way more of the wealth in America than millennials. Now they hold onto that wealth, leaving us to suffer and starve. 

When they went to college it was affordable. When they went to the doctor it was affordable. Houses were affordable. Not every boomer was rich, but even the poorest ones lived in better conditions than the vast majority of millennials today. 

Millennials now can barely afford to feed themselves after spending four years in college. Boomers could raise a family of six comfortably with a factory job they got just for finishing high school, and put all their kids through college too. Even the most basic living wage jobs today, require a degree and years of experience to get. There are even memes about it. https://www.thethings.com/15-memes-you-will-only-understand-if-youre-job-hunting/

I find it funny that you mention them participating in civil rights, when every major civil rights leader was of the greatest generation. Here is a fun one. Even the greatest generation hates on boomers for being to privileged, and spoiled. So they get hate form the older, and younger generations. 

Saying that boomers, had anything to do with civil rights is like comparing them to the teenagers that skip school to go to a rally now. They had no real effect at all. It was the greatest generation that did the most work in hundreds of years to achieve equality in this country. Honestly boomers have done the most to destroy the freedoms afforded to them by their fore bears. 

The patriot act, was the most destructive piece of legislation to ever be passed in american history, and it was a boomer president, and a boomer government that did it. 

This is not some generalization crap. This is not normal generational hate. This is a younger generation crying out because the ones that came before them have destroyed everything that they were supposed to inherit. 

The biggest difference comparing every other generation that came before us to  millennials, and boomers. From basically all the way way back to prehistoric times. All the way back to our ancient human ancestors. Hundreds of thousands of years.  The way basic human evolution works. Our most built in instincts when it comes to the continuation  of our species. 

Boomers were the first generation in that entire line of hundreds of thousands of years. To out right fuck their offspring instead of trying to make the world better for newer generations.

Millennials are literally the first generation in all of human history to have a lower life expectancy than their parents. Boomers, have contributed almost nothing but negative shit to the human species.

I even tried looking up if boomers actually really did anything. Amazingly, even the articles that were supposed to paint them in a positive light. Like this one.
