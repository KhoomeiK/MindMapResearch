Spanish,feznpwx,t3_eqzzc4,1579459418.0,"The literal translation of this sentence is ""I promised to you I have/need to forget you"".
I think ""He prometido que te he de olvidar"" would be more correct. 
""Te he prometido que olvidarte"" isn't grammarly correct. It'd be sth like ""I promised forget you"" which doesn't make sense. You can't put after the ""que"" ""olvidarte"". ""Te he prometido olvidarte"" would be correct, but ""He prometido olvidarte"" would be even more correct, because putting the ""te"" two times feels repetitive.
Though the sentence ""He prometido que olvidarte será lo último que haré"" it is correct.
So based on that, I think it has to do with the subordinate clause.
I'm sorry if I didn't explain it correctly, as I'm a spanish native speaker it feels complicated to explain why it isn't correct"
