AskReddit,fegmd5n,t3_ep2kop,1579097144.0,"In New York City a lot of people have a sandwich containing eggs, cheese and some sort of meat (usually bacon or breakfast sausage.)

Bagels and cream cheese or a bagel with lox is also a pretty popular here.

A traditional Weekend breakfast for a lot of people usually consists of eggs, breakfast meat and some style of potato. On weekends I like to have pancakes or waffles with sausages but throughout the week I usually just have a bowl of oatmeal since the bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches tend to be really fatty and unhealthy.

A lot of the younger adult crowds tend to do brunch on weekends and brunch menus typically have a huge assortment of different kinds of breakfasts but usually have at least one or two traditional American weekend breakfasts like eggs and meat or an omelette with potatoes."

I deleted Instagram and haven't had that urge or impulse to see a pair and instantly go on eBay and purchase it.. I'm not sure if you use any kinds of sites that show u figures that would convince you to buy, but if you do, cutting back on the site's usage is without a doubt a huge help."
