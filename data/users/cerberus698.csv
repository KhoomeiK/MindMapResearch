This is a really bad hill to die on as an argument for liberal democratic governments in the west.

A collectivist government won an election and the US basically injected jet fuel into the right wing paramilitary groups present in the country as a response.

Holodomir is another one I see people bring up, a genocide perpetrated by the Soviet Union against the Ukrainians. Stalin was attempting to rapidly industrialize Ukraine, in order to do so, he had to incentivize them to move to the cities. This was supposed to be done by making food more plentiful in cities and more expensive in rural regions, unfortunately there was a poor harvest in Kazakhstan which resulted in about 3 million ethnic Kazakhs and Ukrainians dying of starvation. The USSR attempted to make up for it by buying grain from the western European nations but they embargoed the USSR in an attempt to, literally, starve out a communist revolution. This sounds horrible, and it was, but people rarely have such a harsh criticism of the British who's Indian colonial agricultural policy was directly causing famines that killed over 10 million Indians every decade from the beginning of their colonial rural; the last famine occured in the mid 40s and killed over 2 million people.

It can be absolutely infuriating. For example, my employer changed insurance providers when I was already a year into HRT. My new doctor and my HMO informed me that the HMO only accepted internal letters of recommendation from their own mental health department. I was told that the HMO would not pay for my hormones until I met the criteria for diagnosis with their own therapists and that would take about 2 months. Of course, its illegal to refuse continuation of care in the state of CA but my doctor told me the HMO would try and do it anyway. She pointed me to a government agency to complain to and as soon as I told the HMO I was going to complain they immediately accepted the outside diagnosis.

A lot of people just go to informed consent clinics and get it over with because obtaining treatment can take months and cost you several grand just to get started. For example, when you're poor, the cost of going through the standard process can be entirely prohibitive, so you just save up 300 dollars for blood work and find an informed consent clinic with a sliding payment scale that works out to free at your income level."

Most people avoid politics. Most people don't vote. A very common response to why that is is ""it doesn't matter."" Whether it matters in a materialistic sense doesn't really matter because these people think it doesn't. Most platforms play with margins. When you don't have much, that margin isn't much. The ACA is actually a great example. Even in medicare expansion states you still have people who inhabit the middle ground where they make to much for the credits but the plans on the market basically wipe them out. You have low income families who are paying 200 dollars a month for a plan with a 10,000 deductible and that was just the option that hurt the least. You gotta understand how disheartening that is to live that reality and be asked to vote for more of it. The ACA was a fantastic thing. It helped millions of people.

The thing that Sanders brings to the table is voters who don't normally vote. He activates a group of people who feel that whatever the normal politicians are serving up doesn't help them or have any meaningful impact on their lives; and they're right. If you made 45 grand a year working a full time or multiple part time jobs in 2016, your life is probably in no way meaningfully different today under Trump than it was under Obama. It probably wouldn't be meaningfully different under Clinton. You would still be making the same amount of money. You would still be pushing questions like ""how will I ever retire"" to the back of your mind because you know the answer to that question is ""I wont be able to retire"". There are truck drivers out there who make 120k a year but spend 50,000 of that fuel and another 30,000 on servicing. That guy knows it doesn't matter if ""democrat/republican #54003"" gets elected. So he doesn't vote.

Bernie and Trump, in the context of 2016, were different though. They promised something different and thus, activated some of those people. A lot of the Bernie primary/Trump general voters would have never even bothered to vote had it been Clinton V Cruz or Clinton V. Rubio because there would have been no ""other"" option. No one would have been there to say ""we're going to try something radically different because this isn't working out for you."" I feel like people need to remember that Trump lied in 2016. I think that gets forgotten, not that he lied, but what his lies were about. The racism was the only honesty he showed. There was a segment of his base that ignored the racism because there was an economic message. It was incoherent and obviously full of shit, but it was a different message than the one that they felt had failed them for the last 3 decades.

So, here we are in 2020. If you've completely disassociated from politics and ignore it, like most Americans, chances are you're life hasn't really changed as a result of his administrations policies.

They have a problem with owning massive amounts of vacant housing and then leaving that vacant housing unoccupied for large amounts of time, arguably to control property value.

They're trolls. By definition, you will almost never engage with a trolls sincerely held beliefs. Their arguments won't be conveyed to you in good faith. The only ways to beat their discourse is to punish them for engaging in it. If you have a receptive audience and an advantageous medium of communication, you punish them by simply silencing them. If you don't have a any form of control over the medium, you punish them via social consequences. You cannot appeal emotionally to a troll because if you appeal emotionally to a troll, you reward them because, again, they do not have any consideration for the condition of the people they are directing their ire towards.
