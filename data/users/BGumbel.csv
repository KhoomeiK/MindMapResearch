I know it's stupid, but not being able to see far bothers me. It's great to visit but for whatever dumb reason, I feel most comfortable in the flat plains."
todayilearned,ffgucjj,t1_ffgslsd,1579915278.0,"How could you live in such a disgusting featureless and boring place? How dare you, you really have some nerve. If you had a SHRED of adventure, you'd move to Davenport Iowa, you know that?"
todayilearned,ffgtl1u,t1_ffgq8v7,1579914718.0,"Why would it be funny? I mean, what do other people even look at? One tree then a big stupid mountain is up in their face? Where do they even keep their corn? In the stupid ocean full of salt? Oh look I have a dessert full of sand and shitty spiny trees. Do me a favor and just gimme a break. Just this one time, just cut me some slack, okay?"
nfl,ffgpvvf,t1_fffgank,1579912040.0,I was changing a wheel bearing on my car in during that game. I made a record 7 trips to the parts store. It was cold and I was working on gravel and I haven't yet forgiven the Broncos for that.

firewood,ffgmuek,t1_ffglyvu,1579909909.0,"From what I can tell from the website, they are all the same until the Aspen model, the size is just different. I have read that vermont castings got bought out semi recently by a pretty big company, but it's the good kind of buy out. Parts are more available and the secondary burn chamber is more robust firebrick, and customer service is far better. As far as price goes, that's the cost of any decent enameled stove, as far as I've seen, and the vermont castings is far and away the prettiest, especially in what I call ""kitchenaid red"". Plus they have the top loading, which is something a down draft stove really lends itself to."
firewood,ffgkk5o,t3_enspnm,1579908364.0,Those look like Turkey tail mushrooms from the picture l. That's just a fun little fyi for you.
firewood,ffgjubm,t1_fejjt5h,1579907890.0,"Do your homework on vermont castings. Also see what people think about their down draft design. I haven't found many reviews of their newest versions, like 2016 and newer, but prior to that it was fairly common to see people on hearth.com complaining about the maintenance. Like 600$ in parts a year maintainence. Some say the down draft design is inherently flawed and when you look at it, it is sort of counter intuitive. If you want an enameled cast iron stove, quadra-fire makes some pretties, as does Lopi. I'm going window shopping tomorrow at a few other local places, and one of them sells vermont castings. I'm curious to talk to the sales person."

It has a touch screen which drives me absolutely insane. My dishwasher, not cheap either, also has a fucking touch screen. I cannot imagine having to pull open my phone and try and navigate some piss fucking poor app with wet or oily or greasy hands. Ah fuck i just set my stove on 500 degrees for 4000 minutes and then dropped my phone so now i can't stop the damned thing. I guess we're eating charcoal tonight."
