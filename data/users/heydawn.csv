AskReddit,ffbc529,t1_ffbbone,1579759229.0,"The importance of watching the health of a U.S. President: the Spanish flu and a flawed peace treaty

January 2, 2019
by J.m. Opal And Steven M Opal, The Conversation
EXCERPT 

Researchers recently used nucleic acid recombinant techniques to recreate the Spanish flu virus genome from the lung tissue of victims long buried in permafrost. Unlike the ordinary flu, the reconstructed strain can directly infect the brain tissue of laboratory ferrets. Specifically, it strikes the olfactory bulb, disrupting wake-sleep cycles and inducing symptoms similar to those of Parkinson's disease.

This research opens a better view into how this illness behaved a century ago when U.S President Woodrow Wilson arrived in France for the peace talks... 

on April 3, 1919, Wilson fell ill with flu-like symptoms. Recognizing that ""the whole of civilization seemed to be in the balance,"" his physician downplayed the sickness and ordered bed rest... 

Wilson wasn't the same man. He tired easily and quickly lost focus and patience. He seemed paranoid, worried about being spied upon by housemaids...

In other words, he acted like a man with residual neurological problems stemming from a recent bout of Spanish flu."
AskReddit,ffbbone,t1_ffb9und,1579758748.0,"The Great Influenza, by historian John Barry

Washington Post article, 2018

“The president was suddenly taken violently sick with the influenza at a time when the whole of civilization seemed to be in the balance,” his doctor, Cary T. Grayson, wrote to a friend back home on April 14, 1919. “From your side of the water you can not realize on what thin ice European civilization has been skating. . . . Some day perhaps I may be able to tell the world what a close call we had.”... 

He was an enfeebled shadow of his former self, quickly caving in to Clemenceau’s demands.

“It is of course impossible to say what Wilson would have done had he not become sick,” historian John M. Barry wrote in his best-selling book “The Great Influenza.”... ""influenza did at the least drain from him the stamina and the ability to concentrate. That much is certain. And it is almost certain that influenza affected his mind in other, deeper ways.”

I've also read that his flu-related mental deterioration was downplayed at the time, and that this strain of flu triggered neurological damage and symptoms"

AskReddit,ffalpax,t3_esispc,1579738878.0,"Emotional and mental RESILIENCE 

Life will get difficult, chaotic, messy. Pick a partner who can roll with it, who is not easily defeated, who will handle a set back without falling apart, who can problem solve. 

Compatibility (values, interests, sex life) 

Pick a partner who shares your values (very important), who also shares at least some of your interests (not all - you need your own separate interests too). But, yeah, you need to have some things you both enjoy doing together. And you need to be sexually compatible (similar frequency, similar things that you both like)

Trust, integrity, honest/open communication

Pick a partner that you can trust and rely on to tell you the truth - good news or bad - you'll get honesty. Pick someone who communicates easily with you, expresses honest thoughts and feelings, confides in you, trusts you, trusts you enough to be vulnerable with, trusts you to listen. 

Kindness and support

Pick a partner who treats you and others with kindness, and who will support and encourage you. You don't want your partner to be your opponent, to be jealous, or controlling. You want someone who genuinely wants what's best for you, who will help you achieve your dreams, who will have your back and stick up for you, who will want to listen, who will immediately give you a HEARTFELT APOLOGY (rather than a defensive response) upon learning that you feel hurt or disappointed. You don't want someone who takes your honest expression of hurt as an attack that must be defended against.

Ability to handle conflict well

Pick a partner that you can disagree or argue with productively - without resorting to emotional blackmail, name calling, manipulation, etc. You want someone who can compromise, who can let stuff go, who can work things out, who will respect you and your feelings, whether or not they agree with you

Commitment

Pick a partner who will stick it out, be loyal, be happy with the sometimes mundane parts of life, who will not be tempted by the new. A long term relationship can't ever sustain the whole new relationship buzz. But what replaces it is so much better, deeper, fulfilling, and sustaining. But your partner needs to be someone who knows that, who knows newness can't last, and who knows that feeling is not as important as the deeper stuff that comes with a real commitment to a shared life.

Family and household 

Pick someone who shares similar goals and desires regarding kids/no kids, basic philosophy on raising kids, extended families, holidays, and other family stuff (like money habits, lending, spending). It also helps A LOT to have similar tolerance levels for messiness/cleanliness, and to be able to equitably divide chores and tasks.

Qualities that you admire

Other than the essential stuff (honesty trust, communication), pick someone you admire. If you love creativity or humor or athleticism or intelligence or ... (fill in the blank), then pick someone who has that something special that you see as a gift, as something to admire.

Mutual attraction 

Pick someone who you are attracted to. This might seem like a no brainer, but there are plenty of people who picked a safe, solid, wonderful person with a good job (or who checked off whatever boxes you have), but the attraction is inexplicably weak or non existent. And this has to go both ways. You want a partner who is attracted to you. 

Forgiveness 

Pick someone who is slow to anger and quick to forgive. We all fuck up and we don't need someone who can't wait to pounce on our mistakes and who will hold a grudge. Fuck that noise. 

Best wishes."
