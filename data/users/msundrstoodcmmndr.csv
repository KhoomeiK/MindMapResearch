The ones I’ve specifically seen are bright vivid green packaging, but of course that could vary based on where you live. They’re delicious and super crunchy. My favorite are the cinnamon apple flavored ones."

wholesomememes,fee5519,t1_fee2m2w,1579026597.0,"With how you worded it, that person is claiming it themselves and giving others credit for help, which is fine. It looks like you were trying to flip the genders to make a point? Looks like you meant to say “I gave my guy so much confidence” which is still a self-serving pat on the back regardless"

AskWomen,fe3eudc,t3_enlknn,1578848658.0,Sometimes it was at the very beginning they would confess a crush and I would just keep it as friends. The ones who were cool with it and didn’t treat me any differently were the real ones. There are others who make it obvious with big hints most of the time but I just clearly and bluntly turn them down and then go back to talking like normal.
AmItheAsshole,fe3ehea,t3_eno5q8,1578848545.0,"NTA I’m the same way as you about being secretive at first and now in my mid-20’s openly taking it.

godtiersuperpowers,fe3423h,t3_enn5wa,1578845738.0,Maybe nice but as a woman I feel we’d have to turn these off and only have them on when we see our crush or whatever. There’s creepy ass men out there that get horny for anything and I’d rather not know if I’m doing that to them or not

Not sure, I only use Skillshare, and always look through behance and things like that. Mine is Behance.net/savanita if you have one. I’ve heard good things about Lynda.com but never used it.

Websites like Dafont you can sort out through which are 100% free, or if you can then donation-based. If you only create outlines for text as a way to go around it - nah, you’re still using their text! Don’t outline your text for that reason because its not a loophole. If anything you can outline it and then mess with the fonts to change them a bit (soften edges, play with the width, etc.) to make it different enough then that might be your best bet."
