Speaking from experience, a kid lacks the perception that there's a way out if abuse is a factor. Unfortunately the way out becomes taking their own lives."
offmychest,fdq4b27,t3_eml4h2,1578654187.0,"First time I thought of dying by suicide was during winter break. I was in 8th grade.

Here's the deal: summer breaks, winter breaks... are prime seasons when kids are at high risk of taking their own lives. The support network that they would otherwise find through counsellors, teachers, etc, isn't there. If for any reason they find themselves in crisis at home, they can't just talk to someone in school. In the case of abuse in the hands of parents (my situation), they may fear that talking to a friend's parent might just eventually get found out by the parents, in which case shit will hit the fan even harder.

Just speaking for myself here, but don't be so quick to think of some parents as ""strict but loving"". From the outside looking in, so were mine. Yet you'd be appalled at how emotionally, verbally, physically abusive some parents still are nowadays,  under the guise of ""we're strict but it's for your own good."" However you see your students' parents behave in front of you, I'd wager is a small, ""curated"" sample of how they treat  their children behind closed doors.

And I'm talking about ""nice parents"" with income in at least high six - to seven figures in some on North America's richest postal codes.

P. S.: I know it wasn't intentional but please consider updating your language. One commits a crime. In Canada and 50 US states and territories suicide is legal.

Edit to add: I was first abused when I was still crawling. First bullied by classmates at 5. By the time I was 8 I had been to two open casket funerals (relatives) and knew damn well about the finality of death. At 10 I had already been brainwashed that I wasn't a good daughter, despite outstanding grades and never causing trouble to teachers. Always tried being helpful to classmates because that was the only way I could be remotely accepted."

One of those numbers turned out to be of an angel whose name I still don't know.

I asked her if she knew him, told her I was worried about him. She said the words that saved my sweet little ass:

When you call, if the receptionist tells you it'll take a while to be able to see the advocate, ask if there are drop-in hours. If yes, show up as early as possible to see the advocate, and explain your situation along with the mental health background.

CMHA advocates know of resources and avenues that most of us don't, and can also hook you up with a social worker.

That said, though it's hard, I'd open up to your sister and would explain the situation. The prospect of homelessness (especially at this time of the year in TO) is to be avoided at all costs.

MakeupAddiction,fcg0cvm,t3_dwfewa,1577635359.0,"Hey Abbey, I found this post via the skin graft update you posted yesterday. I also saw the post about the z-plasty contracture release.

I know it's not at all similar and it pales in comparison, but I had a skateboarding injury on my face earlier this year, and have learned a few things that might be useful. Keep in mind I'm not a doctor or health practitioner!

&#x200B;

* For the first while (about 10 days, including after the stitches were removed) I made sure the area was always clean, then covered the area with Vaseline, and applied a specific type of film bandage on top of that, called Tegaderm. From what I've read, you don't need to change the Tegaderm bandages more than once a day. From the research I've done, many plastic surgeons recommend Vaseline for burns and cut injuries as it keeps the new tissue moist while creating a barrier against microbes, etc.
* To clean the wound, I used Iodine Povidone swabs, which I found at a surgical pharmacy across the hospital I went to. It's inexpensive and easy to use. The stains went away.  It was someone from the pharmacy who recommended using the Iodine Povidone swabs, and I did some research and found some scientific evidence that it helps with scars (here's one paper abstract: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19168293](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19168293)
* Once I was no longer using the Tegaderm bandages, I started applying La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Gel B5 Epidermal Recovery a few times a day on the wound. It's a gel that absorbs super fast; there's no perfum, and it definitely has helped my scar to heal faster. I still use it when I remember.
* For coverage, I have a [Makeup Forever concealer](https://www.makeupforever.com/us/en/face/concealer/full-cover-M12306.html) that I got before this happened, and it's definitely full coverage. The one I bought is called ""Makeup Forever Full Cover"" (not very creative, eh?). Found it at Sephora a while back. La Roche-Posay also has a milder foundation-type product called Effaclar Duo+ Unifiant, that comes in different shades. It's not full coverage, but it helps my face when I have an allergic reaction.
* There's another concealer called ""[Amazing Concealer](https://www.amazingcosmetics.com/collections/all/products/amazing-cosmetics-amazing-concealer)"", by a company called ""Amazing Cosmetics"", that provides a lot of coverage... a little goes a long way!

&#x200B;

It goes without saying that your injuries are a lot more severe than mine, and like I said, I'm not a doctor. I don't know if you're still at high risk for infections, etc, so check with a plastic surgeon if you can. Plastic surgeons often know good products they can recommend for scar coverage.

offmychest,fdq4b27,t3_eml4h2,1578654187.0,"First time I thought of dying by suicide was during winter break. I was in 8th grade.

Here's the deal: summer breaks, winter breaks... are prime seasons when kids are at high risk of taking their own lives. The support network that they would otherwise find through counsellors, teachers, etc, isn't there. If for any reason they find themselves in crisis at home, they can't just talk to someone in school. In the case of abuse in the hands of parents (my situation), they may fear that talking to a friend's parent might just eventually get found out by the parents, in which case shit will hit the fan even harder.

Just speaking for myself here, but don't be so quick to think of some parents as ""strict but loving"". From the outside looking in, so were mine. Yet you'd be appalled at how emotionally, verbally, physically abusive some parents still are nowadays,  under the guise of ""we're strict but it's for your own good."" However you see your students' parents behave in front of you, I'd wager is a small, ""curated"" sample of how they treat  their children behind closed doors.

And I'm talking about ""nice parents"" with income in at least high six - to seven figures in some on North America's richest postal codes.

P. S.: I know it wasn't intentional but please consider updating your language. One commits a crime. In Canada and 50 US states and territories suicide is legal.

Edit to add: I was first abused when I was still crawling. First bullied by classmates at 5. By the time I was 8 I had been to two open casket funerals (relatives) and knew damn well about the finality of death. At 10 I had already been brainwashed that I wasn't a good daughter, despite outstanding grades and never causing trouble to teachers.

CMHA advocates know of resources and avenues that most of us don't, and can also hook you up with a social worker.

That said, though it's hard, I'd open up to your sister and would explain the situation. The prospect of homelessness (especially at this time of the year in TO) is to be avoided at all costs.

MakeupAddiction,fcg0cvm,t3_dwfewa,1577635359.0,"Hey Abbey, I found this post via the skin graft update you posted yesterday. I also saw the post about the z-plasty contracture release.

I know it's not at all similar and it pales in comparison, but I had a skateboarding injury on my face earlier this year, and have learned a few things that might be useful. Keep in mind I'm not a doctor or health practitioner!

&#x200B;

* For the first while (about 10 days, including after the stitches were removed) I made sure the area was always clean, then covered the area with Vaseline, and applied a specific type of film bandage on top of that, called Tegaderm. From what I've read, you don't need to change the Tegaderm bandages more than once a day. From the research I've done, many plastic surgeons recommend Vaseline for burns and cut injuries as it keeps the new tissue moist while creating a barrier against microbes, etc.
* To clean the wound, I used Iodine Povidone swabs, which I found at a surgical pharmacy across the hospital I went to. It's inexpensive and easy to use. The stains went away.  It was someone from the pharmacy who recommended using the Iodine Povidone swabs, and I did some research and found some scientific evidence that it helps with scars (here's one paper abstract: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19168293](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19168293)
* Once I was no longer using the Tegaderm bandages, I started applying La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Gel B5 Epidermal Recovery a few times a day on the wound. It's a gel that absorbs super fast; there's no perfum, and it definitely has helped my scar to heal faster. I still use it when I remember.
* For coverage, I have a [Makeup Forever concealer](https://www.makeupforever.com/us/en/face/concealer/full-cover-M12306.html) that I got before this happened, and it's definitely full coverage. The one I bought is called ""Makeup Forever Full Cover"" (not very creative, eh?). Found it at Sephora a while back. La Roche-Posay also has a milder foundation-type product called Effaclar Duo+ Unifiant, that comes in different shades. It's not full coverage, but it helps my face when I have an allergic reaction.
* There's another concealer called ""[Amazing Concealer](https://www.amazingcosmetics.com/collections/all/products/amazing-cosmetics-amazing-concealer)"", by a company called ""Amazing Cosmetics"", that provides a lot of coverage... a little goes a long way!

&#x200B;

It goes without saying that your injuries are a lot more severe than mine, and like I said, I'm not a doctor. I don't know if you're still at high risk for infections, etc, so check with a plastic surgeon if you can. Plastic surgeons often know good products they can recommend for scar coverage.

I wish I could do a lot more to support you. I can't say I know what it's like, but you've got yourself someone cheering for you here north of 49. Stay strong, and be gentle with yourself."

Thank you so much! I've been getting professional help and am very thankful for it -- it's just that the holidays are hard (and the professionals are off on vacation (much deserved).
May you feel at least ten times as happy as you've made me."

GoForGold,fc9qoi2,t3_egswq2,1577556752.0,"Wasn’t invited by anyone to spend Christmas with them, even though people close to me know I don't have family to spend Christmas with. The person I love is thousands of miles away and in no position to fly over to see me. Neither am I. I didn't get a single Christmas card either. 

I survived a serious suicide attempt a couple of years ago (very close call). So being by myself on Christmas made me feel that all those messages of ""you're not alone, we love you, etc"" were just lip service.

I don't expect silver or anything, it won't do me any good... Just feels less lonely to vent."

notlikeothergirls,fc4vedz,t1_fc4u6yr,1577429971.0,"Wow, Ad hominem much? 

I'm far from being a moron. Mistaken? Perhaps. I wrote that based on the fact that an older gentleman I know, from Afghanistan, told me his religion forbade him from drinking coffee.

Which, in retrospect, doesn't make much sense, given that when I visited Berlin I was invited by Turkish shop owners to have coffee with them.

So I don't know why the Afghan man told me coffee isn't allowed."

xxketo,fc4dknf,t3_eg1fw1,1577413570.0,"Electrolytes and maybe low blood pressure would be my guess. There are no-sugar electrolyte powders you can drink throughout the day to avoid that (Vega Energizer in Berry flavour is the one I like). You can also carry a packet of salt with you and put some salt under your tongue if this happens again, in case it's low blood pressure.

Edit to add: There's no shame in stopping your run if you feel like this again. Passing out is extremely unpleasant (and unsafe if you hit your head). Then lie down with your legs up against a wall."

It'd have enjoyed being able to give something in return (even though it might not have been much, given my current financial situation)."
