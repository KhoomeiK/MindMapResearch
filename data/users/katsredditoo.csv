dogs,fehzki4,t3_ep5jpm,1579127069.0,"Hi
I took my first dog when he had a lot of the symptoms your dog is having.
I was unsure as to whether I was doing the right thing but in your heart you know it is the right thing to do.
It will be very hard for you but you must think of the suffering your friend will go through if you prolong saying good bye.
Thinking of you both.
Best wishes xx"
