15% of Clinton voters voted for McCain, 12% of Sanders voters voted Trump. And you’re right that what about ism is wrong. In this case, I think it’s relevant. It keeps getting brought up that Sanders cost Hillary the election even though he campaigned for her from the day he dropped out. Some suggest it’s because of strong attacks against her during the primary. If a candidate can’t be criticized during a primary without fear of them losing the general, they’re a weak candidate. But really, the fear of Bernie-or-bust types is unfounded. They’re a minority of his voter base, who themselves are not the majority of Democratic voters.
