The private prison example isn't really a great argument for you to make because while it's not a good business model ethically; it is literally the only option of a business model for private prisons to make a profit (friendly reminder that this is the primary purpose of a business).

All of that aside, nothing you have said actually addresses my original point. I simply said paying less taxes is in Amazon's best interest (as it would be for ANY business). The poor or otherwise unethical practices of other businesses doesn't really apply to this discussion. So no, neither were great examples."
