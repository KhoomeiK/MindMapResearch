CollegeBasketball,ffazarm,t1_ffaz4ri,1579747965.0,It's fucking wild. Like UNC is worse than wake forest. Wake Forest had their worst product in years. And that's special in itself
CollegeBasketball,ffayzms,t3_esl7hl,1579747758.0,"God damn the ACC is brutal. You could spin a wheel, and this game would be the 2 teams playing"
CollegeBasketball,ffaylcw,t1_ffayfe4,1579747493.0,That game now is an average kenpom of 70 something
CollegeBasketball,ffaydjk,t1_ffaxydd,1579747352.0,"For what it's worth, if it came down to us making the tournament or you beating Georgetown and taking our tournament spot. I'd probably pull for you."
CollegeBasketball,ffaxr0t,t3_esl7hl,1579746942.0,"I can't say I want UNC to win, id just really like maximum chaos. And vt to lose"
CollegeBasketball,ffaw4eq,t3_esm5mv,1579745859.0,Girard is shaping up to be our most controversial character since devendorf. I'm into it
CollegeBasketball,ffavpnl,t1_ffauvw4,1579745588.0,"Ya. Like when I was a 20 year old dude I punched people in the face sometimes. I never really wanted to but I had no control over myself and my emotions. 3 years changed alot and a decade later I couldn't see myself using violence for anything. It's not exactly unreasonable to say I went bat shit crazy and it's not the man I want to be or how I see myself. Infact if he sees himself as the bat shit crazy guy, he's got much bigger life problems coming."
CollegeBasketball,ffask6f,t3_eskv1e,1579743503.0,Gurrier really does look like a young rak. I'm so excited to see him next year
CollegeBasketball,ffarxo6,t1_ffarrw8,1579743080.0,You're kind of a whiny bitch yourself you know. Discussing calls and coverage is 2/3 of the purpose of a game thread.
CollegeBasketball,ffartm5,t1_ffaq987,1579743003.0,Fair
CollegeBasketball,ffaq4ta,t1_ffaprgz,1579741874.0,"I'm not so sure. Maybe if he kembas us to a decent tourney run he will, otherwise he's gonna get told to go back. No intangibles per say and undersized for an NBA 2 or 3"
CollegeBasketball,ffapm4g,t1_ffapfdo,1579741522.0,I'm still sad
CollegeBasketball,ffapjoy,t1_ffapdt6,1579741475.0,Probably worse than them making the tournament atm
CollegeBasketball,ffan67r,t3_eskv1e,1579739878.0,"So like, you need to establish position to draw a charge .."
baseball,ff7xhia,t1_ff78fra,1579660686.0,"I think it's important to remember that all accounts of shoeless joe are that he was pretty stupid. beyond just illiterate, his contemporaries make him sound like a true dumbass"
baseball,ff7x1d9,t3_es3p16,1579660381.0,As a Cooperstown local tho. Fuck Jane Forbes Clark. I feel bad for Larry she had to ruin his moment. Lady is one of those people who wields money for respect and in a small place like Cooperstown it works. She's done a ton for the community but then fucks it all up every time she desperately wants something.
realestateinvesting,ff65fq3,t3_erp8ge,1579619574.0,"Walk/drive. I don't travel to Target new markets, but I certainly aquire target markets while travelling. I generally just park and walk. Small town, suburb, city. It doesn't matter. You will pick up so much non quantifiable data your head will spin. I walk and then I go back and look at rents and price points. I don't actually remotely invest, but this is the kinda shit I find fun. Needless to say, my wife disagrees."
snowmobiling,ff62eh1,t1_ff60d05,1579617409.0,S11a is where I was guessing. Youre just a few miles south of it
news,ff61omg,t1_ff5xjme,1579616871.0,"Use an aluminum body instead of plastic? I mean, pretty much all trinkitity shit like that could be made from aluminum or other metals that are incredibly easy to recycle, they just aren't because plastic is insanely cheap in dollars. It's insanely expensive in environmental terms, but we don't bill for environment yet."
baseball,ff5xf7b,t1_ff56qcd,1579613430.0,"I always have skeptism about calling X local millionaire a saint. Like, dude made millions while people on the sales floor were making what 40k tops? King, maybe. Saint...umm no. It's not even to say he's a bad guy, just certainly not a selfless saint"
baseball,ff5w4qk,t1_ff5afho,1579612250.0,Ken really doesn't need anymore angst and pressure in his life. Leave the poor guy alone
politics,ff567ll,t1_ff54d92,1579581379.0,I think you're mistaken about surveillance. True leftists are certainly about individual freedoms and not impressed with the state.
snowmobiling,ff54f6d,t1_ff52ltj,1579579932.0,Wondered the same thing. Looks a lot like the trail headed east out of forestville ny
worldnews,ff43lsw,t1_ff3u07f,1579554799.0,"I'm in the trades and have been most of my life, I'm 30 so there is still a ton of room for melt down, but I have none of the physical issues. Why? Because I take care of my body and treat lifting appropriately. If an employer tells you to do differently tell them no. Make them fire you for safe work practices and profit. That's why you save a rainy day fund."
realestateinvesting,ff1ujcn,t1_ff1mfro,1579486499.0,Because most people would prefer the world not entice them to keep and use a handgun on another person. Many of us with our ccw would prefer not to have it.
baseball,fezgpir,t1_feyqt91,1579457179.0,Lol. You don't need to quit your job to be an official. Grass Roots is very real and where it all starts.
baseball,feygga9,t1_fey35wu,1579445189.0,"so what you are saying is, ""no, I don't care that this is what his umpire training has told him to do, it doesn't matter to me what the rule actually is, I'm going to complain that I don't like it while doing absolutely nothing but being a keyboard warrior to fix it"" got it. Dude. If you don't like how baseball is being umped, you can get paid to change that."
CollegeBasketball,fewusoh,t1_feul5te,1579419817.0,"Ken pom is a fantastic tool to compare past performances. Using past performances to predict future outcomes is on aggregate, very effective but subject to hard-to-quantify variables. That influence a college basketball game at least a perceptible amount."
