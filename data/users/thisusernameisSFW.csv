Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ffjxtla,t3_ety184,1580009918.0,You look amazing! And those brushes are cute af. Can you share how you apply your eyeliner? I love it!
biglittlelies,ffbhcm3,t1_ffaqhyk,1579765337.0,But it is explained what happened and the context. Perhaps you missed those episodes.
GoodGirls,ffbcb7c,t3_esotws,1579759412.0,Ok
ContagiousLaughter,ff2jkxb,t1_ff2hytn,1579509062.0,Copy and paste the link into google. I had to do the same because the shared link wouldn't load for me either.
aww,ff2iyyu,t1_ff2g79b,1579508238.0,Aw I want to see a picture of them.
GoodGirls,ff14tzt,t3_eqzksp,1579475190.0,"Annie is a hoe? Why? 

You sound like a not very nice person."
ContagiousLaughter,ff13egn,t1_fez6kws,1579474796.0,"And before you know it, they're learning to drive, graduating, and moving away for college. Everyone tells you about that part, about how fast it goes. 

But one thing people don't really express to you is what it really means when they say to cherish every moment. Your child will always be your child, but they are not the same person they once were. No one tells you that you ""lose"" your little ones. You don't get a chance to say goodbye to them either because you won't realize it when it happens. Until one day when they are in middle school and it suddenly hits you that they've grown up, and you'll never be present with the little version of them again. Their faces change, and after a while, you can't see the baby you once held anymore when you look into their eyes. 

So take tons of videos. Damn near every single day if you can. Keep them saved and backed up to have forever. Of all the things a person can regret in life, let me tell you that recording too many moments with their kids won't be one of them. 

Thank you for sharing yours. <3"

AskReddit,fegrq1l,t1_fegpjkk,1579100988.0,"You could try a therapy light. You can find small desktop sizes for around 30 bucks. You dont have to have it glaring directly in your face for them to work. I work in an office with no windows, I only get about 30 minutes of daytime light on my way to and from work. I turn my light on, facing slightly away from me but to where I can still see the light peripherally, while I work during the first half of the day. It helps some.. Better than nothing at least."
