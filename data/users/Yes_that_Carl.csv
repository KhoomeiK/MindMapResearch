Put it in an email and copy her on it so she’ll have a record of you putting her in her place. I’m sure it won’t be a problem for long."

1. Complaining about people not cleaning up after themselves is hardly limited to “old woman bitch”es. That kind of thoughtlessness irritates a large swath of the population.

2. Are you certain there’s a “whole department” to take care of dishes? Most places I’ve worked, the janitorial staff wouldn’t clean dishes. It was seen as something that should be taken care of by the individuals who used the dishes.

3. Not being acknowledged is a real thing for women over 40. Not in the sense of being praised, and not in the sense that women over 40 choose to be upset about this, either. It’s a legitimate phenomenon that the older a woman is, the less likely she’ll be acknowledged as _simply being in the room._ So yeah, it’s probably a legit grievance for her.

4. “Shrill house marm”, assuming her only life experience is in raising kids, “shrill ass whiny voice”, “such an old woman complaint” — you do realize that if you’re lucky, someday you’ll be a woman in your 60s, right? Or do you just assume that you’ll be a “Cool [Older] Girl” and that sexism and ageism won’t apply to you?

5. Are you really in your 30s? (Hell, are you really female?) If so, I’m straight-up _embarrassed_ for you. Learn some shit. Do better. Be better."
