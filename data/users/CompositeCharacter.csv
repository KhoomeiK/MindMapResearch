From 1970 to 1992, the population decreased from 65,000 across the African continent to 2,300, a drop of 96 percent, according to statistics from the International Rhino Foundation.

Put another way - since permits to hunt black rhinos have been available, their population has more than doubled.

>Aging male rhinos can be territorial and will interfere with mating female rhinos and younger male rhinos, hindering population growth. South African officials argued that by allowing game hunters to target only that problematic group of old males, the policy had the potential to not only increase the chances for healthy reproduction but also increase discretionary revenue.


>In their study on rhinos in 2011, TRAFFIC noted that the introduction of sport hunting in South Africa coincided with a steady rise in white rhinos. In 1968, when game hunting was introduced, there were 1,800 white rhinos in the nation. By 2011, the population had swelled to more than 18,000, according to the report."

If productivity gains are the result of the business investing in computers as opposed to handwritten tickets, or mechanization / automation (capital investment) then the productivity gain wasn't due to a greater sum of work being done by the new and improved labor, but rather the capital investment.

>These results continue to support the basic story in our earlier work; namely, the data still show a substantial pickup in labor productivity growth and indicate that both the use of IT and efficiency gains associated with the production of IT were central factors in that resurgence.

>The Trustees project that the combined trust funds will be depleted in 2035, one year later than projected in last year’s report.

>Social Security’s total cost is projected to exceed its total income (including interest) in 2020 for the first time since 1982, and to remain higher throughout the remainder of the projection period. Social Security’s cost will be financed with a combination of non-interest income, interest income, and net redemptions of trust fund asset reserves from the General Fund of the Treasury until 2035 when the OASDI reserves will become depleted. Thereafter, scheduled tax income is projected to be sufficient to pay about three-quarters of scheduled benefits through the end of the projection period in 2093. The ratio of reserves to one year’s projected cost (the combined trust fund ratio) peaked in 2008, generally declined through 2018, and is expected to decline steadily until the trust fund reserves are depleted in 2035.

>Under current projections, the annual cost of Social Security benefits expressed as a share of workers’ taxable earnings will grow from 13.8 percent in 2018 to roughly 16.6 percent in 2040, and will then decline slightly before slowly increasing after 2051. Expressed as a share of GDP, program costs equaled 4.9 percent of GDP in 2018, and the Trustees project these costs will increase to 5.9 percent of GDP by 2039, decline to 5.8 percent of GDP by 2052, and thereafter generally rise slowly, reaching 6.0 percent by 2093.

Raising or eliminating the 'cap' will not completely solve the problem.  Some other increase in taxes or reduction in benefits will be required.  Both of those things make it more of a transfer than it presently is."
