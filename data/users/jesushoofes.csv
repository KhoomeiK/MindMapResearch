&#x200B;

I imagine it's mostly been made illegal because it makes it too easy to hunt deer, and promotes overhunting even when the hunter has met his maximum quota.

But I don't see anything wrong with spotlighting for your hunt other than the fact that it makes it less difficult and is somehow less worthy of a method of hunting."

todayilearned,ff8fjig,t1_ff8cwqr,1579676273.0,"Yes and why do you think the costs are so high? Because there is no single payer system! If Canadians are being charged too much for a procedure, the entire province can tell the doctor performing it to go fuck himself, you're charging way more than anyone else.

 What about in the states? Well that's a case by case basis, but your insurance has to haggle with the hospital in general, and that's why you have absurd costs to begin with, and if you aren't insured you don't have any power at all in lowering the costs, you're on your own. Yes things vary state to state hospital to hospital etc., but that's how things are so crazy in general. 

The same things happen with medication. You can't just raise the price of a medication arbitrarily in Canada, because we collectively say no. 

If you don't have that collective bargaining power, why wouldn't a drug company jack up the prices of their drugs? Why wouldn't a hospital triple the price of a procedure? You want a government body to regulate this, but where is it getting the funding from? I suppose it would have to take money from income taxes in order to do so, in sort of a single public system... hmm..."

The bigger factors were the lack of trust in the Concorde after one of the only fourteen airliner's crashed and killed all 109 aboard, the general downturn of passenger flight after 9/11, and the final straw being that the manufacturer declined to continue providing replacement parts after over 30 years since production."

And they were banned to begin with because sonic booms are really loud, not because of some nonsense about competition. There were only 14 production aircraft anyway, and most flights would be close to 20k USD each way in 2020 dollars. They weren't going to bankrupt the American aviation industry."
todayilearned,feulrus,t1_fetxoym,1579387731.0,"Well one crashed and killed everyone aboard in 2000, so that was a pretty big factor. Then people stopped flying as much after 9/11, and lastly the manufacturer decided to stop offering replacement parts.

Another user already explained it better than me in the youtube comments:

&#x200B;

> That man playing Luca Brasi is Lenny Montana, a former enforcer in the Colombo family.  His role in the movie was part of the deal the producers made with Joe Colombo for him to stop opposing the production of the movie. This was Montana's first tole ever, and he was incredibly nervous to play the part against such a legend like Marlon Brando. So Coppola tricked him by saying this is only a rehearsal before the actual shoot and shot the rehearsal. Coppola later added to the script that Brasi was overwhelmed by the Don's invitation to his daughter's wedding to explain the nervousness of Montana in the scene. Compare it with the later scene in Bruno Tatglia's nightclub with Solozzo. He is very calm,collected, and comfortable. That is because that was a scene of a situation that he was very familiar with, a mob sitdown. He was practically playing himself.
