cringepics,fe62dlp,t1_fe5ulid,1578880239.0,Exactly this. This happened to me with a Hello Fresh delivery driver and it scared me to death. I turned the guy down and stayed at my parents’ for two weeks because I didn’t feel safe in my apartment.

gifsthatkeepongiving,fdwwj0i,t1_fdwgnar,1578762992.0,Can we stop with the misinformation from that stupid copypasta? It’s so on brand for Reddit to take something that’s cleverly written and run with it as fact.

TheMandalorianTV,fclpcrl,t1_fclo8ao,1577753213.0,Have you read the lore of the weapon though? Or like...seen any Star Wars where the idea of the Dark and Light sides are fundamental to the universe? That the balance of the two sides is key to almost every Star Wars story? Are you aware that *all of this is imaginary?*
TheMandalorianTV,fclnjgf,t1_fclleyg,1577751977.0,The Darksaber is canon though.

Statistical analysis is oppression."
fatlogic,fci5vyd,t1_fci5jdp,1577658131.0,"Even if people in the 1940s and 50s were cooking with these ingredients, *their portions were reasonable.* According to this girl on FB though, that doesnâ€™t even matter."
fatlogic,fci4adj,t1_fci2pfu,1577657613.0,Her post was so hilariously wrong all I could do was screenshot and share. The opposite of almost *all* of her statements is true and she has like 200 â€œyou go gurl!!!!â€ comments supporting her.
