Finding someone you can spar with and still respect for having a different point of view is awesome, and she's my polar opposite in so many ways..  I wouldn't want it any other way.   Obligatory ""to be fair"" part of my post:. We did break up and get back together like 3 times... It wasn't until I finally realized that  without her I felt like I was missing a part of me, and I finally admitted how much I wanted and needed her in my life.  Once that happened and I accepted her and myself exactly how we were.. it was amazing.  For your sake I hope it doesn't take you all the pain and time it did me to realize what I had in front of me.  Good luck OP!!"
