beauty,ffavbhn,t3_esm1xl,1579745332.0,I have that same problem but I didn't used to. It's mainly under my nose and chin area. I moisturize and use a primer. Maybe it's the wrong combination primer and foundation? I'm using the Smashbox pore reducing primer and the Armani power fiber foundation.  If I don't put foundation in those areas just primer it looks ok.
