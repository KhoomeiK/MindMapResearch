depression,feyc0h6,t3_eqs4h8,1579443525.0,"Saying "" suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem "" isn't pretending depression has a cure, and it's not a promise that your life will be nothing but sunshine and unicorns some day.  You have shitty days, and you have good ones.  It's acknowledging that nothing is changeless.  Some days I wake up happy to be alive, others with the knowledge that my dog is counting on me the only thing that keeps me going.  A good psychologist and medical management helps.  NOBODY is worthless, and the only thing that is forever is death.  If you aren't already doing so, I urge you to get professional help in coping with your depression, and learn to take joy in little things - for instance, when I get severely depressed, I treat myself to sushi.  It ain't much, but it's something I love and so it's like a little gift to myself - and sometimes it's enough to help me carry on."

depression,fe2fdnp,t1_fdsjcz3,1578837749.0,"Nothing is forever - except death.  Back in the mid-eighties, I worked search and rescue in the San Francisco bay area.  One of our stations had the unenviable duty of responding to suicides off the Golden Gate Bridge.  Only about 1 in 20 survives the jump, so usually it becomes a body recovery mission.  One night, however, it wasn't.  When the boat crew pulled the kid aboard, the first words out of his mouth were ""As soon as my hands left the rail, I knew I had just made the biggest mistake of my life, and all I could think while I was falling was 'Please give me a second chance.""  That has resonated with me ever since when times got hard.  


This isn't the kid we pulled out of the water that night, but this guy had a similar experience.  He's worth a listen.

Between then and now there have been a lot of ups and downs, but I wouldn't trade those experiences for anything.  If I would have taken that last step a long time ago, I would have never had them.  Hang in there, OP.  It's worth it."
depression,fdqynub,t3_emt07l,1578676886.0,"Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  Yes, life sucks right now, but it WILL get better - you're absolutely right: This isn't the time - and it never will be.  Somewhere, you have people who care about you and who would miss you if you were gone.  Sometime, you will meet the right one, and the pain will all be worth it.  Posting here is a great first step toward reaching out for a connection with people who understand and empathize with what you are going through, and can offer a shoulder to steady yourself on when it gets to be too much."
