MentalHealthPH,feiy7l7,t3_ep3ndg,1579150535.0,"Hi, OP! Thank you for taking the time to do all the things you do for him. May I know what his treatment plan is? Is he seeking professional help? If so, it would really be great if he could discuss this to his doctor.  

As someone who has Bipolar, I understand the depressive episodes. I just got over mine like a few days ago. And it really sucked the life out of me. My girlfriend helped me a lot through it. We're not always physically together, but she always makes me feel her presence. Goddamn, when she tells me, ""I'm here for you, mahal"" and ""You're not alone,"" I feel like I'm about to burst into tears! Those are simple words but they mean a lot, trust me.   

What can you do? Think of the things that he used to do when he wasn't depressed, urge him to do them. Too depressed to do a thing? Be with him. For example, if he used to like reading and he can't even flip the pages over, read to him. Ask for permission and hug him or put an arm on his shoulder. Do not invade his privacy, please. Do not force him to do anything at all. Make it feel natural. Like, how about you bring over a puzzle and start by forming it altogether by yourself, then say something like, ""I'm lost, and I think you can really help me with this."" It's a bonding experience for you two. Listen to music, sing along, remix, make up lyrics! The possibilities are endless.  

And it's true, you have to be patient. Chances are, he's already exhausted. Having a brain that tells you that you're worthless and not deserving of any love is even more exhausting. After an activity that you decided to do together, tell him some encouraging words again, like, ""Wow. You did really well. I'm proud of you!"" Celebrate little accomplishments.  

Aside from these, it's also really important that you know his coping mechanisms and make sure that they are healthy. Plus points if you could find out the triggers. That way you know better next time.  

Good luck, OP! Don't give up on him! And thank you!
