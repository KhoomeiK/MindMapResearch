Smite,ff7ysqk,t3_es5l6a,1579661598.0,I thought there was voice chat just as a general option and it wasn't ranked exclusive?
Smite,ff7avl8,t3_es1zn3,1579644980.0,"Awesome, thanks bro"
facepalm,feypem8,t1_fexwru6,1579448669.0,It's not but that's not the point of the post. The point was just to point out the stupidity of the situation because he really shouldn't be angry to begin with.
facepalm,few7yg9,t1_few6tlg,1579406661.0,No but the point is the situation wouldn't be a problem to begin with if the guy didn't park over the line. Dude has no right to be angry for his incompetence.

People don't grow without experience so to simply say they don't deserve a ban is kinda short sighted if you ask me."
