mildlyinteresting,fez8xg1,t1_fez500r,1579454946.0,"It depends on where your center of gravity is for the container, not the weight of the can. The CG dictates the moment of inertia, which tells you how difficult it is to roll a body. So, the weight or the content of the can doesn't matter. You could even roll an empty can and it would be faster if it's moment of inertia and the rolling friction is lower than that of the other can"
mildlyinteresting,fez8ct1,t1_feyo6jy,1579454758.0,"Exactly! It matters at speeds where air resistance is a bigger factor. But at slow speeds, like cans rolling on inclined surfaces, it is barely a factor that you need to account for. In case of feather, even low speeds cause massive drag on the body and hence should always be accounted for. But in can of cans, they have a fairly good coefficient of drag in the rolling position and don't cause much drag.
Another thing to note is, that both cans have the same coefficient of drag and hence both cans will cancel out the drag caused in the race, going back to moment of inertia and rolling friction as the deciding factor."
