raisedbynarcissists,ff8nyv7,t3_es2xzm,1579688150.0,"I feel that because of my home life my seizures weren't controlled (n mom didn't want her daughter diagnosed with epilepsy so she stopped doctor's visits) so I had a very hard time in school. Also I felt suicidal due to my lack of social skills. So between trying to stay alive and conscious and graduate, I wasn't able to excel like I should have. All my parents focus was on the Golden child. Now he's a drug addict alcoholic living with his wife's parents and I own my own house and have two grown and high functioning children. I still wonder about what and who I could have been but I am so proud of what I managed to do with no help."

If you have a goal and you keep pursing it, you will find ways to achieve it. Nothing and nobody should stop you. I saw a guy on YouTube that lost his ability to speak become a teacher.
