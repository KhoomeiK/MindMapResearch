fountainpens,ffosid8,t3_euc30a,1580081139.0,"Mine didn't even work. The reviews online are atrocious. I honestly almost got turned off from fountain pens altogether because of this one, but thankfully I have them another chance by getting my first Metropolitan."

AskReddit,ffoj16w,t3_eu725g,1580078170.0,"I was 12 when it happened. I remember waking up for school and my mom telling me what happened. The TV was on and that's what they were reporting. I remember watching it and not wanting to go to school so I could see updates, but as it turns out the news had already spread like wildfire and my teacher actually played the news on a TV in her classroom so we could watch. For several weeks after that, that's all people at my school talked about. My memory is a little fuzzy, so I don't remember everything about it, but I do remember we even had to write poems about it as a class assignment."
