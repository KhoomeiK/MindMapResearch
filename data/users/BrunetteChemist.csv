bipolar,ffbulf5,t3_esknln,1579783281.0,"What can people without bipolar disorder do to help make your life a little easier?

Ask questions when I do things out of the norm. Forgive me for things I‚Äôve done before being diagnosed... this doesn‚Äôt mean that I‚Äôm not responsible for the repercussions of those actions, but nonjudgment and loving me through it means a lot."

bipolar,ff3tpl2,t1_ff3ru7r,1579548639.0,"Hey you respond to all my stuff. I see you! Prozac made me manic too. Lamictal started working at a low dose for me. I‚Äôm so sensitive that I can‚Äôt increase my dose by more than like 12.5mg/day every two weeks. So take it easy, it may work for you. If you feel like it makes you more up than it should you can talk to your doc about titrating up more slowly."
bipolar,ff3okrx,t1_ff3jy6m,1579545497.0,Bah humbug! Hopefully you find what works for you soon. Much love ‚ù§Ô∏è
bipolar,ff3mvxv,t1_ff3kygp,1579544454.0,"Thanks for chiming in! I'm on a combo of meds, but lamictal actually usually works surprisingly well to keep me from going so high. I have Wellbutrin for depression, and Vyvanse for binge eating and ADHD. The vyvanse does give me a little more racing thoughts and the irritable bad kind of symptoms, but then when I add lamictal  it feels like it literally slows my entire thought process down so the racing thoughts and the rest are way better. It's just the stupid adjusting period that sucks (I hope that's all this is... like I said in another comment, if it lasts too much longer, I'm going back to my doc and stepping back my dosage of lamictal by half the amount I increased it to recently.)"
bipolar,ff3hewe,t1_ff3gwum,1579541090.0,Lamictal?
bipolar,ff3gko8,t1_ff3g7xt,1579540598.0,"Yeah. The issue with taking Xanax right now is that if it works too well I‚Äôll fall asleep at work üòÇ I‚Äôve only got a little under 4 hours to go, so I‚Äôll just power through. Then it‚Äôs off to a session with my personal trainer and then I get to go get my eyebrows and eyelashes tinted üòç Then home to good ol‚Äô Xanny to help me sleep. If that doesn‚Äôt work then I‚Äôm gonna actually be concerned."

bipolar,ff3ff3w,t1_ff39d53,1579539953.0,"This just happens for a few days whenever I increase the dose of my Lamictal by too much at once. I have to titrate up suuuuper slowly because otherwise this can happen, I get manicky. It‚Äôs just kinda worse than it‚Äôs been before and possibly lasting longer... I‚Äôm like.... siiixty?ish? Seventyish percent sure I‚Äôll sleep tonight and my brain will have slowed down like it always has when I increase my dose by like, not too much. But if not I‚Äôll back down off my dose increase by half the amount of what the increase was. 

I keep trying to increase my dosage by 25mg at a time and it seems like even as I get closer to therapeutic doses (I just tried to jump from 75 to 100mg,) it‚Äôs just too much of a jump for my body to handle. 

Like I said before (I think I said before?) I‚Äôm working with my doctor on this. I‚Äôm not super worried because this has happened before, it‚Äôs just that the symptoms are not usually this significant... at least I don‚Äôt think. I‚Äôll have to talk to my support peeps and run it by them to confirm."
bipolar,ff2k3bz,t3_er6m52,1579509756.0,"It may not be a great idea if you are unsure, but to offer a counter to the no‚Äôs:

I can go back over ten years in my life and point to specific things that could have been noticed and used to diagnose me and get me into treatment. The reason it took ten plus years for me to get help was that no one in my life knew what BP looks like. 

I don‚Äôt really post my own experience, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve actually posted ‚ÄúI am bipolar,‚Äù anywhere (other than reddit, but no one in my real life knows my reddit username.) But I did start posting educational information. Info graphics, posts about ‚Äúsometimes bipolar mania can look like xyz, sometimes depressive episodes can look like this‚Äù

When I ‚Äúcame out‚Äù on Facebook and began posting these things, I got an overwhelmingly positive and supportive response. Three people commented on my first informational post that they had been diagnosed as bipolar, and I had an aunt call me on the phone and tell me how brave I was for talking about it so publicly. 

My goal is this: to educate the people in my life, so that 1. they might recognize it quickly and get help for the people in their lives, and 2. give information to the people around me so that info might be spread through conversations that they may have with others. This increases the potential for more people to recognize and respond more quickly to those in need"

I just want to state that statistically, the reason STI rates have been higher is due to old folks having sex and not caring if they get an infection because they're already done living anyways."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fenwnxq,t1_fenvq2w,1579291984.0,"OMG I can't believe I didn't think about the fact that saying ""100% black and white thinking is unhealthy regardless,"" is a black and white statement of its own, lol. You are quite right, and thank you for saying such."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fenvonk,t1_fenv85q,1579291630.0,"I guess I can see your point, and to that extent I agree with where you are coming from. I still don't think it's necessary for every woman to give up sex until they find a HVM, but like I said I'm not actually here to argue for one position being better than the other."

FemaleDatingStrategy,fenuice,t1_fenu23w,1579290977.0,"I get that tough love is a thing, but there is still a line between tough love and rude judgement.

I'm not really here to argue the point of sex or no sex, I'm just calling you out to caution your lack of consideration for the other women here. FDS is here to build women up, and 100% black and white thinking is really unhealthy, regardless of what it's about."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fentnjp,t1_fensyw1,1579290646.0,"Thank you! I agree entirely. Take what works for you, leave the rest, and respect everyone else who isn't going to have all of the same things work for them."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fentd0j,t1_fensvfm,1579290526.0,"I'm pretty sure that many of the posters on here advocate for making FDS work for you. If you stick to FDS 100% that's great, but a lot of people are going to take what's useful for them and leave the rest. You kind of just come across like you're judging the hell out of other people who aren't strict disciples, rather than supporting their growth.

Personally, I really like the parts of this sub which support women in the building up of their self respect and ability to command respect from others. I think it sends a really strong positive message. I don't really like it when it just sounds like women cutting other women down."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fenro3l,t3_eq3h19,1579289760.0,"Some of the comments in here really make it sound like there is a chip on some people‚Äôs shoulder. This seems to be causing an issue during the discussion of whether or not casual sex is ever reasonable or okay.

I know that FDS says to keep sex very close to you until he deserves it, but if you‚Äôre not expecting a HVM and relationship out of him and you are confident in your own value, then there‚Äôs really nothing wrong with having a sexual arrangement IF THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE EXPECTING."
bipolar,fefqpld,t1_fef5fks,1579062471.0,"For memory I try to stay on a low carb diet and take fish oil. For energy, vit C absorbs best when taken with food, and the B vits work well with carbs so eat like a piece of toast or whatever. D is for the winter blues."
bipolar,fefqepy,t1_fef5fks,1579062245.0,"Something that I found interesting was that until I got diagnosed with bipolar, I don‚Äôt think that there was ever a question about my ability to succeed. I think that reading the statistics about bipolar probably hurt me more than helped me, because now I subconsciously can ‚Äúmanage my expectations,‚Äù aka not strive to do as well, since ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm going to have fight that the rest of my life. 

In any event, I take vyvanse and Wellbutrin Xr in the morning. I also do a gummy multivitamin, a gummy calcium chew, a gummy vitamin d supplement, a vitamin K chewable, and a fish oil pill in the morning. If I‚Äôm ambitious I‚Äôll add vitamin c as an emergenC brand packet or a vitamin b kool-aid type drink. At night I take lamictal and a magnesium gummy. If I can‚Äôt sleep after I dose up on lamictal I take xanax PRN until I adjust to the higher dose.

It‚Äôs a lot, but most of it is by choice. I like my gummy vits because it feels like I get to eat candy and not feel badly about it :)"

Life is not black and white. The stigma is that people with mental illness can‚Äôt achieve the successes that people without mental illness can.
