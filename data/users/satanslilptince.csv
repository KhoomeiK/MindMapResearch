depression,ff1r8ci,t1_ff04gqy,1579484411.0,I'm glad I'm not the only one who felt like it was more depressing joining this than not and dealing with my depression with myself and my own support group and therapist and psychologist
depression,ff1nzdh,t1_ff1mb50,1579482356.0,"I'm just saying playing off each other's depression isn't helpful either. I mean it's not my business what you do I'm just saying noone has gotten better or out of suicidal feelings when surrounding themselves with only depressive topics. There are lots of things that are proven to help and trust me I KNOW how hard it is to do those things. I've been suicidal on and off for 10 long years. At least one suicide attempt per year. What didn't help? Wallowing in it and not accepting help or suggestions. I'm just at a point where it's do or be actually a husk who thinks of death every minute of every day with psychotic breaks or dead before 24 and I couldn't do it anymore. My dad used to say ""sometimes you need to get angry."" I'm not saying you guys don't deserve to vent but it's not healthy for me anymore and it doesn't seem to be helping any of us in the subreddit because there is no ""ah this post made me have hope"" as far as I can see. We all have small small things that bring us comfort (not that it makes us completely forget) even if it's hey I pet a cat today, but it is all just venting and I was just wondering if anyone had felt the same way I do. I wasn't trying to attack anyone."
MentalHealthSupport,ff1ko1i,t1_ff0bvmd,1579480728.0,Yeah you have to be your own advocate and fight for yourself! I'm sure you will get there! Good luck!
mythology,ff05y1f,t1_fezuvr7,1579465557.0,I agree. Humans tend to want answers for everything and since death effects us all (I've yet to know of any person(s) who are immortal) it goes that humans make stories to explain their own beliefs and make sense of the few big questions answered by religion. I.e. what is the meaning of life? How do I be a good person? What happens after I die? How is or how was life created (either in the womb or from the beginning of man)?
MentalHealthSupport,ff04km2,t1_fezcccl,1579465155.0,Good for you I would have been offended by that as well! It's one thing for the person with the visions or anything uncomfortable to say they think that but to be told to think that way is bullshit and never helps it just makes you angry! My mom told me if I believed in a higher power I wouldn't be so depressed because it would be gods planðŸ™…ðŸ™…ðŸ™… ugh no thanks just turns you off to the whole thing
MentalHealthSupport,ff045x5,t3_eqt1no,1579464996.0,"I would really push with your doctor that it could be a condition relating to psychosis. Honestly I'm an artist as well and lots of my friends are and I would NOT describe what you said as ""normal"" even for an artistic person. It sounds like schitzophrenia or a psychotic break to me?? Maybe start writing down what happened in that day and all your thoughts. Like ALL detail you can recall and once you get a few of these attacks written down maybe you can make connections? Sometimes we can't think of it till it's written down lol

Also I've seen psychologists blow people off who function well or blend in with society and really only take it seriously if it ruins the person's life and is no longer hideable. I would say be your own best advocate and insist in what you believe. Insist that you need help and that you can't just live like this. I used to date someone with schitzophrenia who functioned really well so psychologists never felt the need to really help him. He could hide it really well in front of people and knew it wasn't real but at the same time it didn't stop it from effecting his life and his happiness. I hope you feel better and get the help you need! Maybe try a new psychologist?"
depression,ff02eus,t1_fezyb5v,1579464471.0,"That's so true. And what I said I didn't mean to discount that somepeople might need to vent and not need suggestions but when it's all that I see when I log in is very tiring and makes me want to close the window?? I guess I'm just curious if anyone had the same feelings of ""is this subreddit worth it to me?""  Not that it doesn't help others but is it a detriment to my own mental health?"
dating_advice,fezs6kr,t3_eqv3tl,1579460963.0,"DO NOT LET THESE PEOPLE MAKE YOU FEEL BSD FOR HAVING A SEXUALITY!
 To me it seems like the right guy for you would be committed but not controlling with your body, and sexually open. Maybe try FetLife? Lots of guys just looking for sex but there are a few gems. Guys and girls and everything in-between aren't that different. A lot want just sex the other part are serious.

There are people out there like that. Just be open and try to be yourself and try more dating apps than just tinder. Also put in your profile you are looking for more than just sex and will wait for it. I always put in my profile I'm kinky but i am in it for the long haul too and won't just give it away. Though sometimes I do when I feel like it because that's my business lol! Just unapologetically be you. I met my ex fiance on OkCupid (didn't work out because I'm gay and she came out as a trans woman) and she was perfect personality wise and would have worked out if she hasn't been a she lol there are good people it's just finding them!! 

Also one of the good suggestions is finding hobbies or clubs or meet ups or through friends. Honestly I'd try all of the above! 


Remember just because you show your chest doesn't mean you deserve less, and if they believe that you don't want those men anyway! Men who think that have prob send unsolicited dick pics anyway and are total hypocrites or just straight up shammers. Yuck. ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤¢ Good luck!"

Makeup,fezaosd,t3_eqwo1e,1579455418.0,"Honestly I see a lot of what not to do makeup tips in here and all I can say is the brands they recommend in drug store are great but at the end of the day makeup washes off. They are gonna make mistakes and wear too much or look like a ""clown"" some days. Honestly makeup is self expression and as long as you are supporting you can never go wrong. Let them find what doesn't work for them or does or if they even want to abide by these arbitrary rules. Makeup is about making the WEARER love the way they look, not about people telling you what to look like. That's just being a robot and takes all the fun out of it for me!

Want a shiny brow? Do it up! Want highlighter all over your face? Work it! Want literal clown makeup? Hey I love clowns! Want to wear lipstick that's an odd color? Hey that neon is looking good! 

Just let them explore it but also let them know when it's appropriate to experiment. Like a funeral is probably when you want to be subdued. If they are going to the grocery store then go crazy! 

Tbh everyone in this thread looked ""ridiculous"" in a makeup look they did on themselves at one point but I bet you they loved it and felt FIERCE. we all go through that! (I still do I like more artistic makeup not makeup to make me pretty) ðŸ˜‚ 

Sounds like you are a great dad! They will all figure it out as long as you are supporting and listen to them and just want them to feel good about themselves and teach them when it is appropriate and when it isn't."

depression,fez7z23,t3_eqs4h8,1579454631.0,"No that is a misunderstanding. It can get (not all of the time but a good part of the time) better if YOU really honestly put your all into the therapy, are open with your psychologist in what's going on, and actively change the way your brain is patterned to think. I'm not saying it's easy, it is one of the hardest things I've EVER done. You have to get mad enough to say ""Thoughts you are broken and don't get to tell me when I feel bad anymore. Whenever you tell me something negati e I am am going to actively work to tell myself different and cast aside the negative even if I don't believe it."" You are the only one that can change your thought process and catch those running thoughts and talk back to the voice in your head. You need to realize that a depressed brain tells us shit that isn't true more than 50% of the time. I know depression, I've been in the psych ward more than ten times, so I am a part of a program called PACT that helps youth stay out of the hospital for a year and then you ""graduate"" and I've been in it for about three years. This past half a year is the longest I've been out of the hospital since maybe five years. I have scars all over my body from it and it's not pretty. But what got me to change is realizing that only I have the power to save myself. Honestly I see a lot of self pity on this subreddit and that's fine and all for venting but it won't save any of us from our own demons if that's all we think, it strengthens them. It can get better, IF you are willing to do the hardest job you will ever have in your life every minute you are awake till it becomes a habit. Changing every thought you have in your head. It may take years for it to stick but it's worth it if you want to live. Sure there's the way out but that's a personal journey. You have your fate in your hands, and I'm not saying to do anything just that it is possible. You have to make the choice. I wish you the best of luck and hope you get angry enough for it to stick one day. It took me so long to make that choice. I wasted so many years agreeing with my thoughts. Hope all ends well for you.   I wouldn't blame you if it does sounds too hard because honestly it is almost too hard for me and would have been too hard a year ago. It depends on your will power and if you are willing to work on it EVERY waking minute. Honestly you are only capable of what you believe you are capable of. I hope you don't give up and make a change. I'm here for anyone who needs a positive pep talk! (And no this doesn't mean you are to blame for your depression, there can be so many factors and I don't know you personally. It just means only we can fix it!) I hope I worded this right."
PoliticalDiscussion,fez1kmy,t3_eqtw3s,1579453069.0,"Bump so I can get someones opinion?? I have decided not to call anything racist unless it's very clear but if it's not clear call it just ""not something I want to support as I wouldn't want to be treated that way and judged for something I am born as.""

Makeup,feva3ud,t1_fesbgwm,1579394979.0,Your eye sight might be important to you but for most people it is lol bacteria that her body might have built an immune system to can really damage another persons. Just like when English settlers came to America they killed over half the population of American natives because they didn't have the immune system. It may seem silly but it can save your body a lot of trouble and medical bills or paid time off. Better safe then sorry and in the doctors office lol

depression,feeqtsc,t1_feeqjwt,1579039256.0,Also everyone my point wasn't to all the commentors it was to the poster to look into it as a possibility.

I hope the OP has the best of luck in their HEALTH. Thanks all :)
depression,feeqjwt,t1_feepco6,1579039096.0,She ate what she could but could for the most part only eat a BRAT diet and while under doctor care had to be given hormones to make her BMI go up because she was loosing weight. That's why I know hormones can have a lot to do with weight. While I guess I was upset at the bedside manner I only had mentioned toast but she certainly was not eating enough to make her gain as much weight as she did and I saw her throw up more than 50% of what she ate so we were trying to force feed her at times. She was one of the few cancer patients to gain weight because she was given hormones such as steroids to make it go up. I'm just saying it's something to look into I didn't say 100% that's it it's PROVEN 100% of the time that's what causes this. No 99% of the time it's diet and exercise but it's something to look into.
depression,feeq2fl,t1_feek36s,1579038815.0,"Dude some people have hormone shit that makes them heavy though I'm not saying that most people do and I'm not saying I do, I do not. I'm saying that if she is actively dieting and trying everything there could be medically something going on. It's not impossible but it's not most people either. And honestly anyone can log in online and say they are, not saying you are but it's possible. I'm just surprised you aren't even open to the idea that someone can have weight issues that aren't immediately solvable by just a ""eat better."" Also if you are a nutritionist I'd work on your bedside manner as people come to you in moments with low self-esteem. Saying obviously just makes them feel shit about themselves and doesn't get that motivation for change even if you ARE right. Ya get my drift? And I know for a fact hormones can have a lot to do with it because it happens in patients that have underlying serious issues medically like my mother. Doctor's also don't know EVERYTHING. they gave my mom 100% she would die in six months and it's 15 years later and she's alive because she did her own research because the doctors didn't know everything. She has lieomyosarcoma stage 4. She had a tumor on her heart with spicules going into the heart and lungs. Science is AMAZING and GREAT and come so far but it doesnt 100% know everything. Just food for thought dude. :) Good luck with your bedside manner hope you don't make someones self esteem worse, instead of helping them make a change."
Makeup,feeddt4,t3_eopmd4,1579031442.0,I have very oily skin and large pores from bad acne as a teen and I use pore filling primers with silicone heavier ingredients like benefits porefessional though nyx makes one that's exactly the same and a fifth of the price and I use Maybelline superstay 24hrs and it works great because it takes a while for the oil to break it down!!

depression,fee6kj0,t1_fee00ud,1579027447.0,Ok then why did my mom gain so much weight through stage 3 cancer and chemo when all she ate was toast maybe once a day and threw that up??? Oh right it was hormones. Are you a certified nutritionalist? Probably not seeing your response. Have a good day.

depression,fedzn3w,t3_eomc3t,1579023251.0,"Go to the doctors and get your hormones checked. If you have an bad balance it can cause you to gain weight no matter what you eat. I honestly suffered from an eating disorder (still do) and I get where you are coming from but diet pills are NOT the answer. Neither is just dieting and exercise (though great) can be worse for those that obsess over it (honestly the other commentors sound sliiiiiightly oblivious to ED's.) I would seek help from a therapist and nutritionist as well as your general provider. remember thin/=healthy or beautiful. it all matters how you see yourself and if you are healthy in numbers like heart rate, blood pressure, endurance, weight strength(weight lifting), breathing, hormones, cholesterol, and weight isn't keeping you from getting around. Honestly sounds to me like you might be suffering from an eating disorder or body dysmorphia. I don't think people without those issues would take diet pills that are hurting them daily?? I could be wrong though. But it may be wrecking havik on your stomach and intestines. If there's smoke there's fire.  I hope you get better. Let me know if you have questions!"

depression,fedyj3j,t3_eok6mu,1579022591.0,"Can I ask if you are of a darker skin?? Lost of people will automatically call someone ugly just for them being slightly darker and I know it's very prevalant for Asian communities as well. I can tell you to me I find very few people genuinely ugly. Most of the time what is ugly in one community is beautiful in another. In first world countries thin is beautiful, in third world being bigger is beautiful. It's all about the country and community that can dictate what is beautiful and honestly it's all very up in the air as to what is and isn't. Like in ancient Rome it was the height of beauty to have a unibrow. Is it now? No. Do I personally think it's ugly? No. You can find a community for everything and I think it's important to remember you can't please everyone or be beautiful to every man or woman you meet. Beauty is 100% dictated by their past experiences and bias based on where they lived and in what social group. I personally love strong features. crooked teeth? Beautiful (especially in Japan they think it's cute)! Darker skin? Amazing (white girls will make fun of it but tan like crazy)! Crooked nose? Distinguished and very good looking to me (shows you have some personality to your face, who wants all the same features? Yuck!) Wide nose? Very common in POC (I'd call it a button nose and that's adorable!!!)! Everything is in the eye of the beholder. though honestly I think it's the confidence that really sells it. You could be disfigured and be beautiful as long as YOU believe it and YOU sell it. maybe try looking at self esteem  tips and tricks? Like I try following models that are different than the norm on social media! Get rid of those socially accepted people on your feeds or magazines and start consuming alternative models and media! See if that helps your perspective?? (Also these men calling you ugly are no Lookers I'm sure and even if they are guess what? Looks fade and all you have is your shining personality in the end. Also who would want a boyfriend or girlfriend just because they think you are beautiful? Where's the connection, the trust, the honesty, the communication?) Try telling yourself you are beautiful and see how that feels :) look yourself straight in the eye and say it till you believe it!"
Makeup,fedvs7q,t3_eom867,1579020936.0,"
I disagree with the whole no high coverage concealer. Not everyone is looking to look natural as noone wakes up with perfectly bright under eyes lol at least not at anything above 16. I would definitely try under eye cream along side better sleep schedule (unless it's genes then just the cream) and a heavy concealer. Shape tape doesn't need as much powder and the powder is really drying. But for the eye shape you could look at deepset eye tutorials but I would go for a rounded eye look but honestly it's all about personal preference. I would before bed start experimenting with different shapes eyeshadows and find what makes you feel best about yourself? Forget what everyone else thinks looks best on you what do you feel makes you most confident? You could go out with the most extreme makeup (and I have. I mean Avant gaurde and I get compliments because it makes ME feel good so others tend to just love it too.) I know it's not the best advice in the world but if the under eyebags are still not what you'd like them to be I know a lot of people from India have GREAT solutions for it as a lot of them suffer from genetic darkening of the skin under the eye. also color correcting with light layers and then a medium coverage concealer will help cover it till you can do eye masks for it. Color correcting if not done right can be cakey and if done well isn't. It's also about what kind of product you use that will make it cakey. Try a lot of color correctors and find one that's best for you! Also your eyes are great as is, though I know it's more about how you see them."
depression,feduj9y,t3_eomy2w,1579020188.0,Honestly I get what you are saying but at the same time I've been in therapy since I was 13(23 now) and the best you can do is build that support outside of therapy with friends who understand and family or chosen family that understands. A therapist won't always be there either but they are a great WITH therapy. Also even better if you can add groups in with that. But most importantly? You HAVE to train your brain to be your support group because the world will not always be so kind and you won't have everyone available all the time unless you are best friends with 100 different people all in some different time zones and working different hours so you constantly have someone at your disposal and even then honestly most people will get tired of it constantly being your problems they talk about. And it's not really anyone else's job either to be there 24/7.  I would try my best to get used to group activities and try new medications. I know trying some got a bad taste in your mouth but it really helps it let up enough to try and change your thought process if you find it impossible. Still meds won't fix it entirely. The fix comes from a long time of training ourselves and our brains to fundamentally change. No more letting thoughts meander. We have to police them and basically be a traffic cop for them lol! I know it sucks but it's honestly the truth. Don't rely on just one source for help. Try everything! Sometimes all after another if one doesn't work!
depression,fedteb8,t1_fedrdh1,1579019492.0,"That is more so to to see if YOU feel you have made any progress, because things may seem fine on the outside but it may not be. I.e. the person who laughs the loudest is usually the one most depressed old story.  After all she may only see you one hour of the week. There are lots more hours in the week than that! I've been in therapy since I was 13 (23 now.) So I can tell you after seeing a therapist for a long time they all ask that. They also ask if your being honest if they feel you often try and cover how well or not well you may be doing which a lot of depressed people do. I wouldn't take either to heart. If they say you haven't made much progress THEN you should be worried."

Sure it's great to have someone there but friends are also for that and so are hobbies and family or your chosen family. You are NOT less of a person without a partner. Do not think of someone else as your other half, YOU are your other half. They are just cherry on the cake. Take care and remember you are whole."
