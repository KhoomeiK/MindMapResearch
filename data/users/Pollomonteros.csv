I heard somewhere that the problem with loneliness is that at some point it becomes addictive,and I think it's what happening to me right now. I stopped caring about maintaining old friendships and feel too lazy to even make the effort of meeting new people,which shouldn't were not for the fact I would love to have someone to share my interests with.

It has reached a point where I stopped caring about growing up as a person,even though I know it will benefit me and right now I am in a situation where I kinda hate my life and the complete lack of purpose I have imposed on myself yet I have zero drive to change"

Destroy all Humanity,it can't be regenerated : 
I am liking it so far,for moments it feel like Hi-Score Girl meets MTG,but personally I have no problems with it since I loved the setting of Hi-Score Girl. Later chapters seem to flesh out the characters a bit more. The only problem I have with it so far is that there are only 14 chapters and the scanlation group refuses to release the episodes in Mangadex for some reason."
