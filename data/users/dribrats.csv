learnart,ffn90q7,t1_ffn1kr8,1580063238.0,"The emptiness of the background is not the issue for me, as much as trying to get that black  silhouette to sit on the paper: at the moment the contrasts between blackness/ and soft palette Is making that image float a bit. consider:

* shading the foreground to lend depth of field and integrate the black of silhouette 

* there’s a carmine-ish hotspot on the water in front of “drinking gazelle”— and I miiiight stretch all of those tones into perspective, maybe transform/warp, or equivalent — into a slightly more discernible horizon. 

* it’s A poetic notion that the moon is being caught by the tree… But at the moment it’s so perfect that it’s maybe not translating.It might be helpful to push the moon and back a little bit, so that the tree is catching the moon, and not fully encasing it? 

( it’s a bit lame i can’t see the image as im critiquing it… But it looks beautiful and reminds me of a famous artist who does silhouette work— if I remember I will link it. She’s an African American woman, and I think she had a huge show at the Guggenheim in 2010ish)"

The ultimate lesson.

* CC: nothing really to say, youâ€™re going to be fantastic and SOON. Your darks are a a bit heavy handed, try using heated smooth paper, which is better for  technical drawings. Additionally, develop those areas slowly with lighter harder pencils, then use a smudge and eraser to developreflections and shaded areas near the turbine, (maybe reflections off the tarmac) and cool tendrils in those amazing exhaust plumes, etc. . (Itâ€™s lame I canâ€™t see pic while typingâ€” so pardon if precoffee I donâ€™t recall certain elements). 

 TLDRâ€” youâ€™re amazing. Kids today!! your darks are too heavy, try heated smooth paper rives/bfk, or vellum. With an 1.5 hours slow down, & develop with smudge, eraser, and chamois, before giving over to the DARK SIDE.
