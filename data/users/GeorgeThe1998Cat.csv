There's also a Pippin and Merry, but unfortunately Pippin passed away suddenly very recently.

Ohhhh there's also a Gimli, and there was an old rescue named Gandalf :3 my sister tends to name her males after LotR characters, and females from HP (Ginny, Narcissa, Lavender, etc)"
Spyro,ffh6uil,t1_ffgwour,1579924751.0,"It seems a lot of these toxic fans have the mindset that if you were born in the 2000s and like/prefer TLoS then that negates any opinion you have.

I was born in '98 and my first Spyro experiences were with Year of the Dragon, and either Enter the Dragonfly or A Hero's Tail (I'm leaning more towards AHT based on my memory of the appearance and graphics). But TLoS is still my preferred Spyro, though I enjoy the originals as well."

I'm not an expert by any means, but I think they never re-released the games, besides the Greatest Hits version of ANB. So what they made initially is what the world got (I assume). I was lucky to find TEN a few years ago for PS2."

When I tried female bettas, one of them went savage on my snow white guppy and threw him around like a dog toy :/ so, I've never tried mixing them again. But I think it's interesting I tried males three times and they were fine, and the first time I tried females one of them earned her name from it (Hathor)."
raisedbynarcissists,fec6ttl,t1_fe9xy9c,1578967639.0,"Thank you! I love my fish dearly and many people don't understand how to care for them properly, but I'm hoping the one store that might take them will draw in a more responsible crowd (the employees always seem really knowledgeable, more so than say PetSmart employees). I'll miss them a lot, I've been keeping fish for almost 7 years now. But they're not worth dealing with my father, unfortunately.

I've found out I will be going to my bf's, so we've decided sometime in February. Fingers crossed it all goes smoothly."

I have info in the post, but I'll say it here too.

First goldfish shown is Jelly Roll, aka Marmalade (my brother started a tradition of all my goldfish having secondary names). I bought her on August 4th of 2019, and I'd estimate that she was around 2 inches, probably shorter. Now, January 13th 2020, she's definitely at least four inches.

The second goldfish shown is Sauce Packet, aka Dick. I bought him March 22nd of 2019, and I'd say he was a little under 2 inches, not including his long tail. Now, also January 13th, he's around 4 inches, longer if you include his tail fins.

And these are just my two largest, I have four other goldfish who are younger and smaller. They get big, and need room to swim just like any creature needs space to exercise!"

thedawnpatrol,fdtsxfd,t1_fdtfldi,1578721701.0,"I always took that as just a general care for her, which grew when she was a mature adult. However, there is a lot about the first arc that isn't consistent with the rest of the series. I mean, it's mentioned that toms don't interact much with the raising of their own kits, which is much different in later books. So it seems like yet another thing that was changed to make them more ""human""."

More importantly (because this is a fantasy universe), 2: Ferncloud and Sorreltail were consenting adults when they became mates. I have a friend whose dad is 20 years older than his mom, and they met when she was in her 20s/30s. She was an adult, and therefore able to make her own choices. That doesn't make the dad a pedo."

Meanwhile, I have two goldfish that will one day need a bigger tank, so... I'm not being so successful haha"

foreskin_restoration,fdkttgm,t3_elv10a,1578511019.0,"I'd change up the form. I haven't taken it, but on the first page alone the ages are a bit messy. I'd do 15-18, 19-22, 23-30, 31-45, and so on (I'm going to be 22 in a few days, so my closest assumption would be the 18-22 choice). And seeing the other comments, yeah the masturbating one should be different. I'm more on the lines of once a month, if that (I'm a woman, but with the option of choosing sex I'm assuming I could still take it? Or are you looking for men specifically?)."
books,fdio0ka,t1_fdi3mvu,1578447177.0," > The few I’ve read have read like the author was trying to hard to make “smart” for adults. 

YES this is exactly what I feel. I get so separated from the story, and sometimes I even get lost because the author spends too much time explaining useless details or using ridiculously obscure words constantly. Just explain the scene and get a move on.

There's a time and a place, not constantly throughout the book."
books,fcyycqu,t1_fcxfbnq,1578089797.0," > Is it unsavory, weird as fuck, potentially disgusting and stomach-churning? Absolutely. But it's not child porn and it shouldn't be trialed as such.

This is exactly what I think. It's gross, but if someone's an actual pedo I'd rather they use fiction than irl means. And some people are just into it - for some reason - without being a pedophile. It's stupid to think it's on par at all.

I would love to be a published author one day, but this shit scares me. If this becomes a new law, that even books count as CP, I'm willing to move to a different country just so I can write my stories. I don't write abuse - or murder and rape - to glorify it. I do it to show how bad it is, or because it's a part of a character's relevant (back)story. I'm not rewriting things I've spent years working on just to appease some triggered snowflakes."
Eyebleach,fcv6x6n,t1_fcuu26m,1577995903.0,"""Managed it"". If you mean having children dying constantly. Humans lived as wild animals for a long time in large groups that WORKED TOGETHER to raise children. This whole concept of only two parents raising their children alone is a very new one in the grand scheme of things, and is not how humans evolved. Also, we don't NEED to procreate now. Millions of years ago, we HAD to procreate in order to survive, even if that meant rape. There are billions of humans now, many living in first world countries. We're not struggling for survival, we're not an endangered species. There's nothing selfish about not wanting to pop out MORE humans.

What IS selfish is forcing other people into a certain way of life, or forcing out more children into the world when there's already so many human beings. Look at life beyond your little bubble."
Eyebleach,fculq5i,t1_fcuj2cw,1577983752.0,"That's ridiculous. You shouldn't have to have a child to know whether or not you want any. There is NOTHING wrong with not wanting kids. You can know you don't want kids without having your own.

I'm really close to my niece and nephew, and when I was in highschool I'd visit for weeks at a time to help out with them. I love them to pieces. But I still don't want any kids of my own, and I never wanted any before my niece and nephew were born.

Similarly, I wanted a dog really badly for a while. Now I have a dog. I love him dearly, but now I know I never want dogs again. Unlike children, being a big dog he'll be lucky to live past 13. Kids will be children for nearly two decades, and sometimes you have to deal with them even after 2 decades. I'm sure if I had a child I'd love them, because I'm not heartless. But I know myself and what's too much for me, so I choose not to have any."

WarriorCats,fbwe3nj,t3_eem3ij,1577147501.0,It would have been foolish to stand up for Rootpaw at the gathering. Revealing their alliance too early is a sure-fire way to get it destroyed before they have a chance to try making any changes.
