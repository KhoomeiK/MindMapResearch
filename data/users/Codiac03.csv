Good thing is, my team flanked and sunk hi m while I kept enemy ships off with bombers. We won, and I managed to stay afloat thanks to the other CV not knowing how to use torp bombers effectively (he'd give me enough room to torpbeat, and then some)"

Never been to Europe, but if I go, I'll check it out. I love WW2 era warships. I visited the Texas when I was younger with my brother and dad, and I'm visiting the Lexington on Friday and sleeping on board as part of a school-related trip. I hope the Belfast is in better shape than the Texas though... The Texas isn't doing too great.."

AskReddit,ffu9arn,t3_ev5zdg,1580237184.0,"A few weeks ago. I felt alone, like no one cared about me. It happens sometimes. Partially due to my lack of control over my bipolar, despite being 17 and being on a hearty dose of 1200 mg/day of Lithium. My stepmom was also being a pain in the ass and making me feel terrible about it, which just made me cry more because it made me feel useless in the sense that if I couldn't control my emotions, I was useless"

WoWsBlitz,fftj4dl,t1_ffticv4,1580221900.0,"For the third time, you didn't make it even remotely known you were joking. I even said that I hoped your first comment was a joke, but then you replied with shut up N-Word. In that context, it doesn't seem like a joke. I'm apparently not alone in that, either. Look at the votes on your comments in this thread. I'm not alone in thinking it wasn't a joke. Bad delivery on your part is not a lack of understanding on my part. It's a show of your ignorance to the fact that people can't read minds and don't understand what you mean all the time."
WoWsBlitz,ffti9nd,t1_ffti0aw,1580221268.0,"You're the one who doesn't know how to tell a joke. The N-word is a word many find offensive, sometimes even in a joking circumstance. Its not my place to be offended by it, but that doesn't mean I have to be okay with you calling me that. Especially of it was used as an insult, as it seemed it was. It was a joke. I get that now. Learn how to tell one and this wouldn't happen"
WoWsBlitz,ffthvbe,t1_ffthlm1,1580220962.0,"I understand what a joke is. Keep in mind that it wasn't clear you were joking. I even indirectly inquired about your previous comment and you told me to ""shut up n-word"". So I couldn't tell you were joking, not to mention that I really don't appreciate being called anything I'm not, compliment, insult, or neither. Perhaps it'd be smart to use a /s at the end of your post"

WoWsBlitz,ffqg5ok,t1_ffpjemu,1580133622.0,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they should expect to win many games. Besides, the best way to determine skill fairly is league, so one high league player with low league players is pointless. I know Console and I'm pretty sure PC both use skill-based as well as tier-based. The main thing is not as much skill as it is experience. Low leagues are more likely to be inexperienced, that's why they should be playing mostly against each other. Same goes for high league players."

WoWsBlitz,ffnjmxk,t1_ffni7s0,1580066826.0,"That is fair, but it isn't fair to them. Is it their fault? Probably, but sometimes you reach a point where you can't get better and you're still bad (like me in any FPS game). You simply can't commit any more to it. My post is not the only one of this manner on this subreddit. I believe it's safe to say at least several people here believe that while ship tires should be the primary MM guidelines, matching based on skill is also more fun and fair for both teams. I like a good, challenging game, whether I win or not. I may be alone in that, but I believe everyone here can agree that is sucks when the entire enemy team is your tier or above, and your entire team is several tiers below you. I've seen games like that, and been on both sides of games like that, and on the winning side, it's boring, and on the losing side, it's frustrating to know that you're going to lose. Besides, PC and Console releases don't have issues with skill matchmaking"
WoWsBlitz,ffnhk0l,t1_ffngyau,1580066076.0,"Player-wise. 1 legendary tier, two t8s, 2 t7s, and 2 t6s vs. 1 t6, 1 t5, 1 t3, 3t2s, and 1 t1. Skill-wise, it's unfair. My team mopped the floor with them a few times over. We had sunk or nearly sunk all their ships by the 4 minute mark. The had less than 150 points on the board in the end, we had 1000"

Because of this, I have to check before using the restroom because a Black Widow's favorite place in a house is the underside of a toilet. Especially one that's not used often. Everything about spiders is just SO UNSETTLING. I would say burn them all, but last time someone said that, well Australia isn't getting better...
