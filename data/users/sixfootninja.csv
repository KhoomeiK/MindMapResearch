Uninstall the app and install it from Google play store. This fixed it for me."
oneplus,ff5cxzn,t1_ff5c4un,1579587731.0,Great. Thanks for the update. Have a great day :)
oneplus,ff5464f,t1_ff3rbbt,1579579735.0,I second this. How has the battery life fared compared to the previous updates?
SuggestALaptop,ff2nkzy,t3_er90d8,1579515000.0,"By all means go with the  ***Notebook Lenovo Ideapad S145*** 

Even though the RAM seems to be less at the moment, you can definitely upgrade this at a later stage. 

The second one looks like a significant upgrade in the 

Processor area (i7 over an i5).  
Screen (1920\*1080 over the 1366\*768) - This is the most important factor trust me.  
Storage (512GB over 128GB)   
Dedicated Graphics over the Integrated graphics

Note - The second model comes with a lower capacity battery."

todayilearned,fecx22v,t1_fecwvbu,1578988069.0,All this is because these countries are under long-term U.S. trade embargoes. So I'm guessing there would be no McDonalds there.
oneplus,fecugdh,t1_fecse5o,1578985070.0,Exactly. My OP6 still looks and performs like a bought one (touchwood). I think the clean look of the OP7/7T Pro is one of the main reasons that drew fans. It would be a shame to ditch that to go for a IP rating which IMO seems not many people care deeply about at the moment.
oneplus,fecpuld,t3_eoa70y,1578980310.0,">While the mechanism clearly functions in the long term, there still might be one good reason to get rid of it: an IP rating. 

Really interested to know fans opinions on this. Would you be okay with the punch hole if the phone comes with an IP rating?"
oneplus,fe8vjzs,t3_eo60uu,1578931515.0,The image is an illustration of the internals of the phone which shows the motor movement tech. Similar to the 7/7T Pro models

Beginner question - The Orion constellation looks sideways from where I live, like turn this image 90 degrees. Anyone care to explain how its different?"
dadjokes,fdpt7dy,t1_fdpsl2m,1578639528.0,It was a mistake. Will delete this.

OnePlus6,fdpkuhf,t1_fdpjbof,1578631414.0,I only see toggles for Adaptive Battery and Sleep Standby Optimization - Is there a separate option for Deep battery Optimization?
todayilearned,fdixv12,t3_elkgpz,1578453524.0,That's super interesting. Any idea how the temperature of 2400 C was maintained for the limelight?

oneplus,fcth9h0,t3_eiinye,1577943225.0,"I was looking for this exactly. I too face the same issue, there is no chime once the assistant is activated. Surprised that this isn't brought up that frequently.

I know this is a minor concern and there are workarounds, but a simple chime really does help a lot in the usability."

Real bummer I missed it by a couple of weeks. I was okay with paying for a similar case online, but there seems to be no such cases (size, quality). 

Let me know if you find any good case for the Wireless 2's. I'll keep you posted."
oneplus,fcj822q,t1_fcj75ew,1577679618.0,"Its comes with the silicone case in the box, the hard case is added with the order. In the order page for Wireless 2, it says 'With Gift'. Could you check that.

Edit:Spelling"
oneplus,fcj6tos,t3_eheasu,1577678712.0,"Oneplus now conveniently ships the wireless 2 with a complimentary hard case which is really good IMO. I purchased the wireless 2's a couple weeks before this was live and missed the opportunity.

I've tried searching for the same case with little luck."
