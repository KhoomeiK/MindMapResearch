depression,fdtar6s,t1_fdsja0y,1578714143.0,Wasn’t a mugger was an acquaintance high as hell on meth!! He just sorta stared at me for a moment and I stared at him and I guess he realized I wasn’t CIA or whatever the fuck after a second of that and he scampered off. Another time it was someone I knew very well who was having a psychotic break and I just calmly talked them down and got them back to reality just because I loved them too much and I knew that as much as I was okay with dying they would not be okay when they realized what they did.

depression,fdsdndl,t1_fdrv0zh,1578700264.0,I’ve been held at knife and gunpoint a few times... honestly every time it happened it was pretty validating. I realized my suicidal tendencies weren’t fucking around when my first words were “do it” and just feeling excited
