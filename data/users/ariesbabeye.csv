introvert,ffctg3k,t1_ffciojg,1579806907.0,This! I literally say this and people just tell me to be the bigger person. It’s like an endless circle of everybody feeling strange around each other and even some extroverted people don’t know how to socialize in some situations. It’s like we are all unsure of ourselves if that makes sense
introvert,ffcsxya,t3_esrtlo,1579806613.0,I never understood how people think being an introvert and quiet is unacceptable in social situations but then say things like this to someone. Going up to a person and saying those things is also unacceptable and worst than just being quiet smh

MDMA,ff9f409,t1_ff8yhjo,1579711664.0,True. When I’m at a rave I will be vibing 98% of the time and not recording it. But I like to get at least two three videos of the music and DJ so I can look back on it and show my friends who didn’t get to go. I don’t like when people come up to me and tell me to get off my phone because I honestly rarely pull it out lol.
