To my taste, I make the best latte in Boulder, CO. I bought the Dream instead because I needed the wake timer so it’s warmed for my wife as she’s going out the door."
Coffee,fe6fjlk,t1_fe6ce5n,1578889374.0,"It’s not much work. It takes me roughly 1.5 hr/ week to keep it up. I’m not a pro barista, dialing in can be done faster."
Coffee,fe6b5oz,t1_fe66atb,1578885957.0,"I bought a Lucca A53 direct plumb for our office of 25 folks. When we host training or had visitors it was easily making 20-30 shots per day. It’s been reliable for three years. The grinder is key. Get a digital timed dosing grinder. Eureka Zenith or similar. A softening water filter increases reliability, decreases cleaning and drastically improves the coffee if your water is hard. You’ll need at least person on staff to be responsible for it. Dialing it in every third day or when there’s a coffee change, and a weekly cleaning."

This is the exact answer I got: ""I can understand your concern please do not worry we have already shared this details to our relevant team, we cannot assure you of how much time it will take""

""As of now we do not have the option to change it""

Downvoted. This YSK is a waste of time.

photographs,fdctirp,t1_fdcnihi,1578283878.0,"A tripod isn't going to help get the models eyes tack sharp, people move. I shoot hand held almost exclusively. Most of my portrait work is at f2.8 to f5.6. In you're lighting you've got plenty of light to close the aperture a few stops without getting into high iso to increase depth of field. Get just the face in focus and the background will still blur."

kitchen,fcwawvo,t1_fcvz8p5,1578021180.0,"Blum hardware is great I agree, it's not exclusive to IKEA. Most cabinet manufacturers use that brand for soft close. It's nearly industry standard."
kitchen,fcvsgsx,t3_ej4ylx,1578009085.0,"We went with American Woodmark from HD for the kitchen we put in in 2012. They held up well. We used that kitchen everyday, it's a rental now. They still look pretty good. Not brand new. There is some water spotting on the tops of doors by the sink. If your looking for an affordable kitchen, price them out. With a bunch of upgrades for banks of drawers, a trash and recycle cabinet, a lower cabinet spice rack and all soft close they were the same price as IKEA apples to apples. Our designer suggested using all plywood construction for all end cabinets, it's an option, for durability. We also bought a Kraftmaid from HD for a bathroom and I am really impressed with the quality of fit and finish. They are an upgrade. Both price and durability are higher. If you do go to a big box, go during the weekday, when the A team is working and talk to a few of the designers there. Some are really knowledgeable, and others, well, aren't. We got really lucky with the designer at HD that put together the order for the kitchen. She knew her stuff and it took me months, sometimes years to really appreciate what she did for us. A couple for grand for upgrades will be quickly forgotten. You'll have those nice to have features for a really long time. For reference those cabinets cost $8k for a L shaped 22 x22.

We are currently planning another kitchen remodel and have hired a well respected designer. We are unsure as to brand yet. It may come down to which has the features we want."
kitchen,fcvqq28,t1_fcvmsfb,1578007958.0,I've seen IKEA cabinets with doors falling off the hinges after two years and some that have held up ok for ten. The problem with IKEA is the care taken during the assembly of the cabinets. Blum hardwarnis not unique to IKEA. American Woodmark and Kraftmaid both from HD and Lowe's use Blum.

We couldn't have afforded where we live had our previous home not doibled in value. If you want to live in Boulder proper, buy a condo. Make it work for a few years. Your down payment for the next house will be substantial. If you have to have single family home now, welcome to Gunbarrel or the Ls."

kitchen,fcjm7qt,t3_ehh6cm,1577693505.0,"I think it makes a kitchen look smaller because it's more cluttered. My opinion in a small condo, use the coat closet as the pantry. Get a line of hooks by the door for your coats."
kitchen,fcj74zi,t3_eheswr,1577678934.0,"Thermador, BlueStar ,Meile and Jenn-Air. I haven't owned any of them. We have a pro chef in our family and if it was his kitchen he suggested 36"" induction cooktop and double wall oven with one being a speed oven. We are doing our kitchen and have chosen 36 inch electric smooth top standard heat, double wall oven without microwave or speed oven. My pro chef brother in law is looking for speed above all. We're reducing cost with a standard double wall oven and cooktop. Roasting a chicken in 20 instead of 45 minutes isn't worth the extra for a speed oven to us and induction cooktops hum and auto turn off if we shake the pan too much. Gas cooktop was vetoed by my lovely wife and rightly so because that is way too much to cleanup after a quick protein and eggs breakfast."
