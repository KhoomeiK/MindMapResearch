Srednje sole so vse lahke, gimnazije in poklicne, na tezke fakultete te nobena zares ne pripravi (je pa visji nivo matematike na maturi toplo priporocen, ce studiras karkoli z matematiko v prvem+ letniku).

Zato ti priporocam, da si izberes srednjo solo, kjer so profesorji navajeni na pridne in delavne dijake, ker so tam precej bolj razumni in pripravljeni sodelovat. Dijakov ne zajebavajo, ker dijaki ne zajebavajo njih. To so v grobem sole z najboljsimi dolgoletnimi rezultati na maturi. 

 Zato poklicne sole, kamor se vpise veliko problematicnih osnovnosolcev, v vecini odpadejo, precej gimnazij pa tudi (Moste, Askerceva ipd)."

No, but I told you where you can find the source. I was on mobile, copying links is a pain.

When this is clearly not what happens (in the UK at least). I can't say about forgetting  reusable bags, but they clearly do not buy new ones even if they do ""leave them in the car."""
