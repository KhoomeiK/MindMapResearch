offmychest,ffpo4rc,t3_eugn6y,1580100062.0,Being too young sucks and so does being too old. Corporations like the sweet spot of late 20s to mid 50s. Outside that range is unreasonably tougher to get a damned job.
offmychest,ffpnxwt,t3_eudnum,1580099905.0,"I feel you. Same perspective in my life. Remembering that life is meaningless helps fight the painful lie marketers and political hacks push that it has meaning (to control people's behavior and consumption). I hate lies. I just want work for food, water, shelter, and etc. and ""no, I don't believe your corporate hr bullshit that I must 'love my job'. How about fk you, psychos?"" I work bc I have to, not for any damned other reason. Fk corporate mind control liars."
offmychest,ffpn66a,t3_eudyc4,1580099278.0,Talk to me. I need someone to talk to.
offmychest,ffpmsd3,t3_euhrl2,1580098972.0,You and me = same. Wanna talk?
offmychest,ffpkh0s,t3_euav86,1580097228.0,Fuck. Sorry man. People = shit.
offmychest,ffpjsjh,t3_eufuuo,1580096744.0,"F yeah. I know how you feel. My gf does this to me all the time, being a bossy control freak who criticizes how I do every stupid thing ""cause it could've been done in a better way"" according to her. I finally told her I was fed up with her bs attitude and need to be the boss all the time and told her that ""No, I refuse to consult with her before figuring out the best way to get our cat out from under the bed to take his medicine! Not worth a conversation! Routine crap is NOT a requirement to get a multi-phase plan in place!!!!!"" Arrrggggg! I now yell at her more when she starts trying to dominate everything. She yells back, but I still won, and she knows it. Psycho..."
offmychest,ffphkeg,t3_eucu02,1580095213.0,"What helps me is realizing this life is meaningless and nihilistic. We seek pleasure and to exist to entertain ourselves; then we die. Morals, values, meaning, and achievement are lies we maintain as long as they maintain us. But at some point, many of us break and want something real, something that isn't placating to another person' expectations of us. I want real friends that accept my ugly, asshole personality. It is all that is real. Fk fakes. ""IMHO"". Lol. As if I care about pleasantries."
SuicideWatch,ffogqqs,t1_ffofq0m,1580077462.0,Probably the wisest reply possible for my post. Hats off.

Capitalism,feletxx,t1_feldwhf,1579220506.0,"I see what you mean. I guess I feel like I'm surrounded by people who output market levels of work, yet I am expected to be awesome because no one else in my dept. is as skilled or wants to do high-level output. I guess I worry this situation is a general problem. I shine at first, then people abuse it. My boss (director) and teammates agree with me about this psycho expectation culture where we work, but my internal customers are such pricks, insinuating I must be slow or incompetent bc I couldn't deliver overnight a massive project that by average standards takes a month in my industry. But when I am the hero, suddenly they are my best friends. Fuck them."
insaneparents,feldmvp,t3_epjhbe,1579219708.0,"Never mind how this shows the parent's ignorance. The components that make the computer run are INSIDE the plastic box, dumbass!"
unpopularopinion,feldcy6,t1_fekt5zs,1579219525.0,Good comment. Nuance is lost when it feels better or easier to think issues are that simple.
Capitalism,felcpn7,t1_fel6wcq,1579219091.0,"In a market, others' actions pressure your own output. If psychotic expectations are achieved by burning out Atlases 1 by 1, customers just wait for the young blood Atlases to replace the ones destroyed. I can't hold this pace anymore, so I guess I should just deliver faster, crappier work to please my ignorant customers/leaders."
Capitalism,felcd15,t1_fel7xup,1579218861.0,"The thing is, I've worked at entry level jobs and now at a good white collar job. They all expect uiu to do more than is reasonable in a given timeframe. Money is not my concern: if I could work less for less money, I'd consider that option. But no one has allowed me to, not even in minimum wage jobs. They all think they get ahead burning out their human resources, but pay cost of turnover like fools. New job cuts someone a break for maybe 2 years, then psycho mode expectations kick in. You deliver like a rockstar the 1st 2 years, then they see that as your standard output and just expect more anf more like coke heads addicted to your output. Psychos."

politics,fdj4zao,t1_fdijxpu,1578458592.0,Blood is on state leaders who use violence as a way of life against innocent civilians and our military. We are the U.S. because we don't bow to tyranny and violence. We fight and win.
politics,fdj4ppi,t1_fdishfe,1578458382.0,"I'd be there now fighting if Type 1 diabetics were allowed in our great military. I love our people and I love this country. My family has served and fought in wars to protect us, and I respect them for it."

politics,fdj49p4,t1_fdiklzv,1578458043.0,Sadly it's governments of countries like Iran that do the damage while their innocent people are held hostage to watch. Most people are good; it's the psychopaths that rule them that cause wars.
politics,fdj41f4,t1_fdijs9o,1578457867.0,War is not a choice when the alternative is allowing yourself to be destroyed and doing nothing to stop it.
politics,fdj3wkk,t1_fdiqz5e,1578457766.0,Or defending and preserving. Sometimes bullies don't leave you alone until you speak their language back to them (violence). Sometimes people deserve the money they've made.
politics,fdj3n0q,t1_fdiqvnl,1578457567.0,Or Republicans are the party most likely to stand up to bullies. Sometimes war comes to you.

funny,fdirtxz,t3_elfqd9,1578449624.0,"It's a game to both sides for jobs where it is reasonable for the interviewee to be dispassionate. Both know each side is coerced to lie, so the true test is to see how well you fake your answers to the ""why"" questions. A good faker = more desirable. Thus, businesses refusing to accept a truthful answer in this type of case force otherwise honest people to become liars. And they wonder why they have such miserable employees with high turnover: they're draining emotional energy putting on a show to their managers, when a less burned-out employee would have more energy to actually work! Lol"

CapitalismVSocialism,fcrw87n,t1_fcop8h7,1577907473.0,"By definition, financial security = NEVER WILL BE POOR. EVER. If you are ""okay today"", that doesn't equal grant you a right to others' forced labor to support your kids if you become ""not okay"" later. Quit pretending life isn't HARD and nearly impossible!!!!! All survival is in SPITE of the entropic nature of the universe, working AGAINST which is most efficient, which is chaos and decay. Therefore, ALL success in surviving is a victory owed the person who made it happen against this default of death. If you think I want to waste 1 ounce of energy on sustaining life I DID NOT CREATE, then FUCK you."
CapitalismVSocialism,fcruu34,t3_eiaizi,1577906912.0,"Exactly. Your offspring's survival is YOUR problem. My only job is to stay out of your way, NOT PAY. If you have kids you can't afford, then they DIE. TOUGH. This is called REALITY."
CapitalismVSocialism,fcrucp1,t1_fcol29y,1577906725.0,"The implication is NEVER have kids unless you are 10000000% sure you will never be poor. Otherwise, DON'T have them. DUH."
