He has everything from UFC fighters to big game hunters, actors, comedians, scientist, politicians, health experts, former CIA informants.  It’s pretty wild stuff.    Open talk for 2-3 hours.  He’s pretty dam good at asking questions & challenging the people he brings on."

Ended up with Pokémon blue & a huge clunky green game boy.. 

Those were the days...  Bought a switch & play Sw/Sh now.  I’m 30 years old & still love this game.

WatchPeopleDieInside,ffdjygj,t1_ffdin88,1579822473.0,"Is about the context on how you bring up the subject & how you speak.   I believe it’s very important.   But you probably think I’m yelling or being ill minded.    But I’m not.    There’s nothing quite like having a debate & then coming together through discussion.   I have a massive family 20 first cousins on 1 side. 

We 100% believe it brings us together & we 100% believe no matter how anyone views the world, we love one another.      When else do get to talk to uncle joe?  We all have lives to live & businesses to run or jobs to head into.   Sometimes the holidays are the only time you get to see anyone.    

We as in my family don’t see it as  irritating one another.   
We see it as an opportunity to discuss what’s going on in the world & if we disagree we have a civil discussion about it.     

God bless friend. 

 But I’m done with this page for today."
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffdi1c3,t1_ffdhnl0,1579821298.0,"Ya bc I would love to have a discussion & a heart to heart & there point of view.   Instead your on one side & there on the other.  We can’t talk anymore we can’t have civil discussions.  
Debate is off the table if it came to that.  But a civil debate.   Fact brought before everyone so everyone can then state there opinion.  Discuss why do you think this way?  What brought you to that conclusion?  
When brought up this way you end up coming together on things you both can agree on. & show both side that it isn’t just red vs blue.   There’s a lot of thing we can come together on & turn our focus too"
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffdhfj3,t1_ffdhapx,1579820932.0,My first comment was that we have a rule not to talk about politics.  0_o

WatchPeopleDieInside,ffd6j63,t1_ffd5z06,1579814387.0,Didn’t say I do that.  I’m saying if the topic came up that’s how it’d be.
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffd4g0c,t1_ffd4a6r,1579813224.0,"False.  I will definitely look at both sides.   
But you sound like my uncle."
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffd25o8,t1_ffd1if8,1579811933.0,"Lol man you guys are so defensive.  

I’m a very reasonable person.   
I allow facts from all to put on the table & I always look at both sides 

I’m a business owner & have always leaned right on most issues.  

But I’ve lost faith in the Republican Party with these recent tactics.

Lol all these downvotes just shows the blind following to your “king trump”.  Democracy is gone."
