That was a different incident in California 9 years ago. Wouldn't be surprised if there were lots of cockfighting fatalities in the history of the sport. Turns out, strapping razor blades onto fast and aggressive birds is extremely dangerous."

I think Ferahgo might have a decent time against the Wearet because he's suited to fighting badger sized opponents, but the Wearet's arsenal is pretty interesting and might pose some serious problems for Ferahgo. Also, I dunno how well they fight individually but the Painted Ones from Mattimeo are pretty terrifying and could probably kill just about any character in the series if they get to fight on their home turf and have a numbers advantage."

TwoXChromosomes,fdern4m,t1_fdegp7p,1578345172.0,"So many things. It's an incredibly byzantine system when you really get into it. But the problem isn't so much the barriers from making edits, it's that those edits are reviewed by the community under a system that heavily favors the content already on the site and discourages ""controversial"" edits even when the existing articles may be horribly outdated and referring to antiquated sources. That's why, when an existing article has huge errors, it's very difficult to address them since major edits are frowned upon and are likely to earn the ire of heavily established members of the community for no other reason than because they're uncomfortable with major changes to articles. As I said in the original post though, I didn't even try personally to make substantive edits because during the process of learning how to do so (which is a major headache in and of itself) I'd discovered that many people more experienced with wikipedia had tried and failed at the same task, seemingly in part for the reasons I have pointed out."
TwoXChromosomes,fde700d,t1_fde1b2v,1578332562.0,"I did my thesis in East African history for my BA and the amount of racist, outdated, history that remains on wikipedia is really depressing and the system makes it really hard for an outsider like myself to update any of these pages. In fact, I did some serious research into doing exactly that and found out that lots of other people have made a concerted effort to update the wikipedia pages relating to African history and had given up after being totally discouraged by the system. I understand Wikipedia needs controls to stop just anyone from updating the wikipedia but at the same time, the existing system has made it really hard to make changes that in my opinion are severely needed."

history,fcz586g,t3_ejmlt4,1578093917.0,"Yes, they were. 

&nbsp; 

The strategic value of war Elephants is highly debated for exactly the reasons you've outlined. They were very expensive to breed, train and equip but the real strategic cost of using such a beast is the amount of food it requires. I don't know exact figures, but an elephant requires exponentially more food than cavalry and many would argue you are better off using those resources for conventional cavalry and infantry. 

&nbsp; 

However, the tactical value of such beasts is immense. The most famous example is probably the Battle of Heraclea where the famed Pyrrhus of Epirus battled the Romans to a stalemate. The battle was probably going in favor of the Greeks already, but it didn't turn into a rout until Pyrrhus deployed his twenty war elephants which utterly terrified the Roman men and horses. This sent the Romans into disarray and then Pyrrhus was able to rout the disordered Romans with his own cavalry. Another famous example was the Battle of Hydaspes, where Alexander reputedly had enormous trouble against these beasts. 

&nbsp; 

War Elephants may not have been the best choice on a strategic level, but their efficacy in battle seems to have indeed been legendary."

whowouldwin,fc2a6wx,t3_efr35c,1577348147.0,"Since there haven't been a ton of responses (thanks to the people that responded though) I guess I will post my own opinion. Based on the fact that cavemen did kill megafauna in T Rex weight class, most notably Megatherium, I do think humans could probably kill T Rex but it certainly wouldn't be easy. Against an adult, I would expect a hunting party to take casualties more often than not, which, given the power of T Rex, would likely be fatalities. 

&nbsp; 

Then again, if the humans employ clever strategies such as ambushing the T Rex from high ground where they could easily rain down missiles from safety, they could possibly kill even an adult without any casualties."
