ApplyingToCollege,ffp91qv,t3_eugq6d,1580089215.0,"Before you email the admissions office, send a follow-up email to your interviewer. If they still don’t respond, then escalate and contact admissions."
Crushes,ffoqpsv,t3_eu7lbj,1580080519.0,"Patience is key. I would wait. Don’t try to force things to happen— in other words, keep things on the low and let things happen naturally"
Crushes,ffoorf0,t3_eudt5g,1580080036.0,"Yes!!! You’re getting there I really hope things work out for you :) also, if you respond by smiling and kinda shying away I find that cute too so..."
ApplyingToCollege,ffoahfw,t1_ffo53h0,1580075717.0,"It’s an honest mistake. If it really bothers you email them, but I think you’re fine"
ApplyingToCollege,ffo7z8l,t3_eucqr3,1580075003.0,I just ask more questions
ApplyingToCollege,ffmj18x,t3_eu7w5a,1580055429.0,"Thank you for saying this. I made an account and came on this subreddit literally towards the end of my application process and still experienced the same side effects. High school is a LOT more than just preparing for college. It’s about genuinely enjoying what you do.

Also, for those of you saying that this place is a great resource: it is, but keep in mind that this is a forum, and not everything we say/advise is 100% accurate. Applying to college is stressful, and it’s so random too."
ApplyingToCollege,fflmqkh,t3_eu2hza,1580041501.0,Bruh. No. That’s not how it works lol
ApplyingToCollege,ffk0dud,t3_eu19ge,1580011975.0,"I would first check to see if your schools even require official reports for SAT Subject tests (cuz it’s $12 per school per report, why waste money when your school turns out to be the one that accepts self-reported scores?). As far as I know, I only know of UPenn requiring official reports for SAT Subject Tests."
ApplyingToCollege,ffk070h,t3_eu1dul,1580011819.0,I would just leave it. If your resume is basically the same as what you wrote in your application there’s no need for them to read it again. It’ll probably agitate them
