todayilearned,fekvjug,t1_fekvecc,1579208482.0,Your confusing an incident that happened to soldiers that survived the highway of death with the actual highway of death.  I lived the facts.
todayilearned,fekv4wg,t1_fekux8b,1579208237.0,That isn't the highway of death.
todayilearned,fektq62,t1_fekt64x,1579207409.0,"Well you claimed 1st Brigade 24th ID did something but they had nothing to do with the Highway of death.  The subject of this thread has nothing to do with the highway of death. But you claimed the highway of death was a war crime, and there is nothing to back that up.

The merits of my argument are facts.  A retreat isn't a surrender and it is perfectly within the Geneva Conventions and the Law of Land Warfare to destroy a retreating enemy."

todayilearned,fekkos2,t1_fek44bz,1579202052.0,"Retreat is not surrender.  

Retreat with weapons and equipment is a tactic used by an Army to improve their chances against another force. It is a maneuver of battle and it is not a war crime to destroy an enemy who has not surrendered.  

You are wrong, it is not a war crime."

pics,fd31z67,t1_fd30ek5,1578153970.0,"Iraq shouldn't have started it, and their soldiers, conscripts or not, should have killed their officers and surrendered if they wanted to live.  Those same soldiers you pity now were raping, burning, and pillaging Kuwait until we put a stop to it. They took no mercy on civilians that did nothing to them.  Those innocents were avenged by the coalition.   

Retreating with your equipment is not a peaceful move, it is trying to improve your position to be more deadly.  It is black and white."
pics,fd2tba4,t1_fd2rpyo,1578151412.0,"Funny how I was there and saw the thousands who surrendered get care and feeding and not shot.  They could have done the same, a retreat isn't a surrender."
pics,fd2onpi,t1_fd2o3i5,1578150187.0,They mounted up and rode into Kuwait.  Stayed there during months of coalition buildup.  Remained after a month of US air superiority and bombing.  Chose to run home after it was finally clear they were outmatched.  Had they put down their arms and surrendered they would have survived like the thousands we had already captured.  They chose poorly.
pics,fd2npx5,t1_fd2mal1,1578149826.0,Incorrect.  Those soldiers were not attacked during the cease fire.
