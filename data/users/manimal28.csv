Do we have a statement from any other pedal company or hold them to the same standard? From what I can tell almost every gear manufacturer is silent.  If I had to assume, based on statistics, most pedals and gear is made by people that go to churches similar to the one he went to."

He since distanced himself from that church, but many still demand he publicly and explicitly state he doesn’t have an issue with gay people if that is the case, for whatever reason he won’t make a public statement saying that, so many assume that reason is because he is a homophobic bigot.  Second, there is drama about him “ripping off” pedal designs and only selling clones, despite this being what every pedal company does."
guitarpedals,ffb9bf9,t1_ffb4bb4,1579755928.0,"What I’m getting at is that the criticism of jhs as ripping off pedals is tired and ignorant.  Is every company that ever built a phaser or fuzz ripping off Maestro?  90 percent of companies have a tubescreamer and most don’t even bother to think of a color other than green to paint it.   How many muff clones, how many rat clones, how many klons? Why is it the only time people rush in to whine about pedal rip offs and clones is when it is a JHS thread?  People just shat themselves to buy an EQDs $300  Life pedal that blatantly advertises that it’s distortion circuit is a Rat.  I haven’t seen a single person criticize them for that.  

Personally, I don’t think he sucks at guitar, but it’s irrelevant to his business of making pedals anyway.  I’m bringing Leo up, because his skill in one area, playing guitar doesn’t matter.  He still contributed more to modern music and guitar than a thousand guitar players.  So by the same token claiming Josh is a shitty guitar player means nothing about his pedals or his thoughts on pedals.  You saying his advice is worthless because you think he sucks at guitar is dumb.  Would you not take Fender’s advice about making a guitar because he didn’t play one?  The guy who invented the Hammond organ couldn’t play piano either, guess those are are piles of shit too.

Considering how much you are attacking jhs you should really do more research on the history of music gear."

Tier 2: Pedals available at pretty much every place that sells music gear, these companies invented or issued many achetypal pedal types and flavors: Boss, MXR, EHX

Tier3: Pedals that add another switch or knob to mod circuits from Tier 2, with a few innovative pedals too and cost $200 plus.   EQD, JHS, Walrus, Wampler.  Usually made in the US.
