>I've been here **helping** my absolute best. 

The words you're using to describe this situation indicate that you see what you're doing as a favour to your wife, rather than one of your responsibilities as a parent and husband of someone who is recovering from invasive surgery. 

Your wife is likely to have picked up on that and I think she is mad at you because she feels your frustration is not fair in this context. And if that's the case, she wouldn't be wrong.

>Now even though we're arguing, **I'm still doing the baby tasks just the same and haven't left**.

This is particularly disgusting. You can't seriously pat yourself on the back for caring for your child and not having left despite your argument.
