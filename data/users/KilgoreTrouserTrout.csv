Sauces. They are the Trojan Horse of the Calorie Battle of Troy. 100 here, 100 there, and they all add up. Just a little too much mayo, or a Chick-Fil-A sauce, or a little hollandaise to make your eggs more interesting, and BAM! Your 500 calorie a day deficit is gone.

They are so easy to overlook. In another comment, /u/silentoldsister remarked that the sauce alone in a dish she ate had 240 calories of a 340 calorie (sweet) potato dish. 70% of the calories of the whole dish. The sauce sneaks its calories in there -- who would have thought a potato could have so many?

My potatoes I make are just as tasty, and clock in at 70-100 calories a serving. They have no sauce. What they do have is SPICES.

Spices are the antidote to sauces. Use them instead of sauces. Instead of putting mayo or butter on your veggies, roast them with pepper, salt, garlic, etc. Experiment with what spices you like and use them frequently. They are cheap, available, and have few to no calories. There's a lot of variety and finding your favorite spices can be a rewarding experience in itself.

In my own kitchen, I use a lot of cumin. I slice up a potato, add cumin, salt and pepper, roast it up in a pan, and have a great 100 calorie snack, or half a meal. A little mustard on the side (a sauce that has few calories) sometimes. I do the same with other veggies. Cheap, easy, filling, and relatively nutritional. If you're short on time, you can /r/MealPrepSunday these. Experiment with different spices, veggies and proteins and find out what is the most awesome for you and your lifestyle.

Tiny changes over time is what leads to amazing results. Gentle rains reduce a mountain to a beach of sand. Swapping sauces for spices is one of the tools in our arsenal for this battle."

Let's go back to manorialism. On the surface, from our 20th century perspective, it may appear that the lord owns everything, and is therefore the prime Capitalist in such a system. But there was a lot more to it than that. Consider the worldview of of the typical lord and peasant of the time period. The Lord ""owned"" the land, but there wasn't a capitalized, dollar value set on it. Sure, Lords *did* sell lands from time to time, but this was exceptional. The Lord is bound to the soil as much as the serf. He decides what to farm, where not to farm, how much land to give to the serfs for sharecropping and/or common lands for their own use. The serfs were bound to the soil and couldn't really leave -- but they had some kind of ownership in the system. The world at large was fearsome, and part of the social contract between the Lord and the serf was that he would protect them from attack, and in turn they would work the land for him. Above all else, this system was ordained by God. The Church also had a piece of the pie, which was also part of God's plan. On top of this, the Lord also had feudal obligations to other, higher, lords, up to and including the King himself. The lord manages his little fief, and balances the competing needs of all these interests -- the King, the lords he owes fealty to, the Church, and even the peasants. 

The wealth of the manor was measured in land and its usefulness. Also, there was the consideration of human capital. Part of the ""protection"" part of this system was that lords agreed to provide manpower for the King in time of war, and were also expected to fight themselves. It was a vital part of their fealty oaths; a sacred vow that should always be fulfilled. There is just no way to monetize this concept in contemporary terms.

Let's say the Monopoly Man has a time machine, and goes back to a French Chateau in the 12th century with a big bag of gold. Of course, they wouldn't care if he was packing a bunch of Benjamins -- it would be, well, monopoly money to them, but he could use gold to trade. Although precious metals were known, they weren't used too frequently.

So Monopoly Man goes up to the gates of the Chateau, resplendent in his tuxedo, monicle in one hand, and giant bag of gold in the other. He makes an offer to the *seigneur* to buy the chateau and all the lands -- lock, stock, and barrel -- with the giant wealth he presents. The lord's eyes go wide, as he has never seen such an amazing amount of money. But he has to say no. First of all, who is this foreigner in strange attire and without credentials? And what would he do with all that gold anyway -- he already has everything he needs already, and life is good. *More* riches won't really improve his station much. Most importantly, no matter how much gold he has, he still has all these feudal obligations to attend to, from the King on down to the bootblack who tidies his shoes from time to time. He can't just sell it all for a bunch of money.

In this system, you see elements of capitalism (the lord exploits the labor of the serfs), communism (some lands are set up for common use), and other elements, notably the feudal obligations and preeminence of a Christian hierarchy that is ordained by God himself. You can't just buy your way out of that. In a capitalist system, you can buy anything and everything.

I mentioned the example of manorialism because it illustrates my point, namely, that our current capitalist or socialist models don't compare with it too well. And so it is with a post-scarcity society as seen in Star Trek.

You have to understand where Gene Roddenberry was going with this concept. Let's face it -- most of our Sci is depressing. 1984, Brave New World, Blade Runner, Snow Crash, Neuromancer, etc.,  all depict scenarios where things are futuristic, but the same old problems of greed and corruption still plague mankind. Most sci-fi is a piss-take on current society framed in futuristic realms. The more things change, the more they stay the same.

Star Trek was and is radically different from that, in its message of hope. Most sci-fi offers a stagnant picture of human development, but Star Trek, rooted in its idealism of the 60s, shows us a much brighter vision.

Now, about post-scarcity. Capitalism, communism and socialism are all economic systems based in scarcity: they are all approaches to address the issue of how to distribute *limited* resources to a population. But the world of Star Trek eliminates the need for a lot of the discussion of how to do things. There's no point to any of those systems in a post-scarcity society.

In the Star Trek Economy, there are no brokers, salespeople, middle-men, traders, or shipping companies. There are no distribution networks or supply logistics. There's no copyright -- it would be impossible to enforce, and pointless besides. There's no means of production for laborers to seize or own. There is no capital -- all measurement of ""wealth"", as we know it, is meaningless. You can replicate all the gold bars or mountains of almonds you want. Anyone can. Everyone's equally wealthy. There is definitely private property -- but if someone ""steals"" something of yours, who cares? Just push a button and have a brand new one instantly. Sure, it would suck if someone broke into Worf's house and stole his favorite bat'leth, because the sentimental value couldn't be replaced. But life goes on. Post-scarcity eliminates a lot of Attachment to Things. It's so Zen. On a starship, carting around a bunch of stuff just gets in the way. The way people look at wealth, stuff, property, capital and labor are *beyond* anything capitalism, communism, or socialism can dream of.

Winston Churchill once said ""capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings. Communism is the equal sharing of miseries."" This pithy comment really wittily and succinctly sums up the basic problems of both systems. **Post-scarcity economics** really blows both of those systems out of the water. It has evolved past both.

In Star Trek, people don't worry about scarcity and economics. They are freed from it, and can pursue knowledge, art, and self-actualization without fear of their place in an economic system. It's way better than even the best socialist (or capitalist) ideals.

If you read this far, thanks, and I hope you understand what I'm getting at. I'm not going to write anything further if there are any rebuttals, because if you don't get what I'm saying now, you never will. And I resolved to argue less often with strangers on the internet this decade. May you live long and prosper."

This right here. The Left (in America, at least) has really chased the identity politics stuff and alienated so many people in the process. Most people just want to have a good life for themselves and their family, but the college set wants to split hairs on the finer points of the Oppression Olympics. After Trump got elected, did the Left in America do any soul-searching about why they lost? No, indeed. Instead they doubled down on the righteousness and indignation.

It's no accident that the term ""woke"" is used to describe themselves. It perfectly encapsulates the condescending attitude they have toward anyone who is not as ""enlightened"" as them. Is it any wonder that *any* alternative to all this attitude is embraced as a refreshing change of pace?
