GunnitRust,ff7onlq,t1_ff7hzx5,1579654599.0,Maybe try looking up what a safe operating temp is for a saiga is. And make sure you do some research on the material of pipe. Do not use the rated pressures @ temp from the manufacture as this is a completely different use case.

interestingasfuck,fetdkgl,t1_fer3553,1579374255.0,I always thought it was more of density than hardness.
interestingasfuck,fetd6s8,t1_fet4cha,1579374115.0,Big ones and non-civilian from my understanding. I thought that its not so much the hardness as it is the density. More weight more energy transfer. Also becoming much more frowned upon due to the heavy metal contamination as well as weak radioactiveness that experts used to think wasnt a long term health concern but in dust form and inhaled definitely is.
interestingasfuck,fet6ogy,t1_fet2jw3,1579372259.0,"There would be muchhh worse shit happening without guns. Guns are the great equalizers. Small girl vs big guy in a fight, who would win? Without any weapons that's a pretty easy guess. With guns? Now the girl has a good chance. Now take that logic and apply it to the rest of the world. Conflict isnt about phyical strength or sheer numbers any more. Its about technology, economies of scale and innovation."
interestingasfuck,fet4ads,t1_fesnorh,1579371706.0,My understanding is boat tail bullets have better aerodynamics while also increasing the bullets tendency to tumble upon impact cause more damage to tissue. Hollow points mushroom out and increase surface area to transfer more energy to tissue instead of just flying through the target. Name of the game is to transfer all of the bullets kinetic energy into the target which means trying to prevent the bullet from going all the way through. Someone please correct me if im wrong or feel free to add on
interestingasfuck,fet2imr,t1_fet1idb,1579371238.0,"Yep or anything for that matter. Ever seen someone light steel wool on fire? Now try to light a block of steel on fire. The main difference, aside from carbon content and alloying, is the surface area"
gunpolitics,feoq94j,t3_eq141i,1579303844.0,Sooooo i would not go just for the possibility of someone starting a shoot out accidentally or intentionally. The mob mentality is scary and im sure the police's plan Z is too. I really hope everyone stays safe.

Firearms,feea9jd,t1_fee68af,1579029619.0,"Thank you! Yeah the bay area is usually where you hear about that kinda shit (pun intended). So cal is where is at! Also you'd be surprised how conservative california can be. The big metropolitan areas are very blue but get out of the city and you'll find there are mostly conservatives. 

But yeah you can literally go surfing and snowboarding in the same day. All in the middle of winter without it dropping below 20 degrees.

Sure cost of living is high if you're near the coast. But that's the price you pay to be near the ocean without the chance of having you're house being wiped off the face of the Earth. Also if you buy a house out of the city its likely to be a killer investment as those property values are still low but on the rise."

AmItheAsshole,fdsckng,t3_emv42p,1578699523.0,"NAH. Had the same thing happen with my parents. The strings were a bit different but it was a similar situation. My dad wanted me to drive my bother around and hed provide a car for me. I said ""nah im not gunna be a private driver for my then shithead little bro and im not going to take it knowing your gunna leverage it to make my lil bro and my life more difficult at a inconvenient time."" After a huge argument and a couple of weeks my dad came back with new terms that made us both satisfied. Stick to your guns. Even though you're family this is still a negotiation."

YouShouldKnow,fdllykd,t1_fdlkao4,1578527021.0,"So this was news to me. After a bunch of ""research"" it seems something is going on with the company. Not sure if its a new model in the works (if so it will likely have the same name) or if the owner is looking to sell the company. Theres a lot of mystery and people calling and asking have been told to be patient and that something new is in the works and will be delivered soon. However this has been going on for a while now (earliest post i could find is april 2019) so radar detector enthusiast are starting to grow sceptical."
YouShouldKnow,fdl25bk,t1_fdl1i21,1578515758.0,"If you send Valentine your old one and some money (unsure how much, think $100) theyll send you a new V1 that is more selective with the X and K band noise from new car radar systems, security systems, and motion sensors. My uncle said its totally worth the upgrade. I find my family speeding less and less so ours doesnt get used as much anymore. But long road trips its a must! Especially going through small cow towns in BFE where they drop the speed limit from 70 down to 35 without much warning"
YouShouldKnow,fdkw41n,t1_fdkvwjp,1578512373.0,All good! Just kinda confusing to those that arent aware of radar detectors. All your other info was spot on! Which is rare cause even people with radar detectors dont seem to fully understand all the different bands and what that means for the driver when they chirp
