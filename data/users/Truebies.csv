AskReddit,fejw36r,t3_epjzjj,1579187189.0,"A lady called karen that someone willingly bred with, twice. (Also once my parents close friend) 

Karen grew up privileged to say the least. Her grand father had create a very successful business in the UK and it meant the family had a lot of money, which led karen to living how she liked. 

As a young child I was situational friends with her two children, Ryan and Josh. Both of these kids were abused by her and their father. I know this because they would also abuse myself and my siblings under my mums support. 

Karen would scream and shout. She would hit and pull and spit with rage. She would wash our mouths out with soap and washing up liquid. She would emotionally manipulate us as very young children’s. She sexually harassed my 10 year old brother.

Karen spoked my non drinking mother, in the hopes one of her builders would be able to take my mother home that night. I remember walking in to her toilet aged 5, never having seen my mother drunk, while she was almost choking and being sick. 

Her and her husband Micheal split up after Ryan the eldest was around 5. Turns out he only married her for her money. This sent karen into a deep depression as it’s likely she realised how few people actually like her instead of her money. 

Karen continued to abuse her children until they were teenagers and knew they could get her into trouble for you know, abusing them.

She changed tactics and continually allowed children from broken homes and sexual predators to stay in her property. She housed people with new born children and continually tried to convince the world she was doing her bit by helping the wafes and strays. 

Karen took me out of school at 13 after suffering an attack from a bully. Without consent from my parents or the school. She also had an alcohol predator that was known to the police with her that day. She bought him alcohol and he plied me with it and when she went to pick up her children from school he took advantage of me. 

What the situation came to light to Karen told me I had been asking for such a thing to happen to me.

Let me just point out that Karen is also an outstanding Christian. 

Karen continued to take on more dangerous people while systematically ruining her relationship with her children by putting them last and neglecting them emotionally. This continued until a girl aged 25 with equally scary personality traits and a 4 year old came into the scene. 

They create a weird relationship which was overly sexual, especially in front of her grown up children and leaving sex toys about and all sorts. 

The worst thing? Karen lived like a dog. She lived with dogs and literaly wouldn’t realise if they had pooped inside of her home for months. She hired a cleaner weekly but it would take at least 3 hours just to clean her kitchen every week. She lived like a nasty lazy selfish slob.

This post comes across as if your sister has done something else to annoy you and now you’re considering it because you’re mad at her. Remember the implications it has on your nieces on both ends. If you are truly concerned then tell your sister, offer help instead of punishment. People like this can’t always see the harm they’re doing."

If you have parents that support you without damaging you with their own life’s traumas then you’ve got something very special.

Run away lovely, get away from that terrible situation. Sorry your own family would allow this type of behaviour and these things to happen."

AskReddit,fduouah,t3_en5ji2,1578736477.0,"I used to have a reoccurring dream that I could fly with all my favourite characters in my favourite books when I was 4/5. Always started me in my mums car driving up and hill that was basically just a steep vertical incline I imagine no car could ever in reality drive up and I’d end up driving past a windmill and then get to my home where my book friends would be and we would just fly off with them and feel free. I really missed that dream when it stopped. 

Now it stands out to me because my childhood wasn’t the best and I think that dream was my escape and it was beautiful."
