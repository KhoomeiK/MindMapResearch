startrek,ffi67ka,t1_ffhp03o,1579966165.0,"I have a hard time with the Maquis storyline. When the Skreea came through the wormhole Dax was able to find them an ideal planet with little effort.

If the Federation handed a bunch of planets over to the Cardies I'd be on the next transport out. Losing federation citizenship and living in Cardassian space sounds like a bad decision, given how non federation worlds can be the choice isn't hard to see.

None of those colonies were built beyond small settlements, and Federation space is huge, I'd want to settle a hundred light years from anything Klingon Cardassian or Romulan."

The federal government wants to add new detainment centers at the border and they also run those. Like the ones that kept children in inhumane conditions.
