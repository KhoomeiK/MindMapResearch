But honestly, as long as you feed and walk him everyday no matter what its all gonna be okay. Playing and cuddling are also important of course but i love doing that anyways. So it doesn't even feel like something i have to do."
SuicideWatch,ff5q08f,t1_ff4vo4g,1579605465.0,"I agree. I felt the same when i was around 12 - 16 and now I'm 19 (not necessarily that mature i know). I just slowly noticed in the last couple 3 years that I need to change something if i want to feel better. 

So i tried. And I'm currently working out and doing other things that make me happy instead of miserable.

I started a journal to write down small goals and life goals to organize my thoughts and get things done. This of course probably wont work for everyone, but regardless it all helped me.

And I'm positive that anyone is able to find something in his life that makes it slightly better.

For me it actually was a dog. He's all i have. And i realized that i need to be stronger and better for him if i can't be any of that for myself. And now I'm working on changing myself and my habits for the better.

I'm not looking at the future thinking its gonna be bright by now. Not every day and every task is easy. But I'm doing my best. And I can only get better if i keep on trying. So that's what i do.

I hope you will all feel a bit better soon."

Really well said.
That's just how life works i think. And i hope you all find something as soon as possible so that you  feel atleast a little better."
SuicideWatch,ff5p70n,t1_ff52buc,1579604324.0,"Thank you so much.
He is some kind of  shepherd dog, munsterlander mix. I posted a picture of him on my profile i believe. 
Sending you some love back. I hope your doing okay."
SuicideWatch,ff4j88y,t3_erhro1,1579564919.0,"I honestly always thought the same. And then i got my dog. He's everything to me. 

It will get better, for a little while atleast.
And i believe that everyone can find something that lessens their pain to a point where its worth to keep on trying.

It will get better, if you find anything in this world that helps you to feel again. But that also doesn't mean that it won't come back. 

I just hope that i find another reason before my dog will leave me. It hasn't been easy to keep going at all, even tho i have him. He's still everything and i am nothing to myself. 

But that's kinda how life works. You build up things that make you want to stay and you either change, accept and love yourself for the better until you can live with those burdens or you die.

So it's really not a lie in itself. Its just not everyone's truth. Atleast that's what i think until now."

Whatcouldgowrong,fc0fomv,t1_fc02s1z,1577289686.0,I always play like that with my dog. But my dog also immediately stops when i tell him no..
