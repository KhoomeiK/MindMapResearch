Denver,ffi8ae2,t1_ffh5ozb,1579967674.0,"We don't invest in infrastructure here, politicians and biz are too busy stealing our tax dollars to feed their personal coffers. Our infrastructure is a joke relative to any industrialized country. We obviously need more foreign sponsored toll roads and trains are bad /s"
politics,fff6wt1,t1_fff1fk8,1579877248.0,Republican voters are the enemy now too unfortunately. Lying nonstop causes huge loss of respect for people and institutions. The Republicans are currupt and willing accomplices perpetuating all the false equivalence between their lies and reality. Just because your were brainwashed does not mean your crimes are not crimes. Stop putting your head in the sand with your fingers in your ears.
politics,fff6i62,t1_fff5556,1579876954.0,"We keep setting new lows, we are a joke to the world. Rightfully at this point nobody should work with our country. Our people get dumber by the day and they keep eating it up. The murdochs are smiling ear to ear."
politics,fff63f3,t1_fff4atp,1579876656.0,"Either vote them out start a more aggressive rebellion targeting GOP and their voters. Dont spend $ and disconnect cable so none of your $ goes to fox. Also, stop supporting any republican business and support more sensible people. Relegate these dinosaurs to their own shrinking lie of reality and shun them (family too if they lost their mind). These are not balanced people, they are cultists at this point, make them drink their kool-aid."
Denver,ffeffyr,t3_et1sht,1579845969.0,"That is not saying much, no us airport ranks in the top 20 globally. Our infrastructure is terrible and DIA is a mess. Just because we rate our crap us airports against similar crap us airports does not make a single one of them actually good."
politics,ffef0l5,t1_ffdxqyg,1579845530.0,"Our country is lost, bought and sold. Anyone investing money in the US at this point is stupid. There is no American Dream, they stole that long ago. There is no democracy here, kleptocracy at its best."
AdviceAnimals,ff8vfzy,t1_ff8i7gz,1579697439.0,"The 'American Dream' is long dead, it has not been that way in decades. Anyone looking for a new life would best look to other countries. Curruption, violence, pollution, endemic racism and unending cost of life issues (health care will bankrupt you here easily). Everything is a mcjob now, it really is a joke unless you are that 1%, then it's amazing."
iamverybadass,ff8v47h,t3_erz54v,1579697127.0,Pretty sure the BMW part of that trash statement is reality. They are expensive but they do handle a crash well.

worldnews,fek99yt,t3_epguem,1579195272.0,"Classic mob threats and the biggest economies in the world just rolled over. Nobody should work with the US anymore, or leaders are currupt thugs who will sell their own. Anyone who thinks this is acceptable behavior missed ethics and should expect our allies to treat us similarly. It's coming, don't be surprised."
environment,feff2z4,t1_fef364d,1579054972.0,"NC again.. . This isn't even new for this state, a few towns did the same thing years ago. Very backward in many areas of NC."
politics,fe4jyre,t1_fe2j7l9,1578860144.0,"Nothing has changed, this country is a fucking joke at this point. We cheer liars and evil people. We applaud ignorance (fox News proves that) and our populace believes violence and guns solves everything. We deserve to be shunned, bombed, etc... Our president encourages you to step into another stupid war with no purpose and to disparage your neighbors. Sure, keep drinking that kool-aid laced with cyanide."
politics,fe4iyh7,t1_fe1iy6o,1578859850.0,"Propaganda at work, lots of people will die and they will cheer because we are equivalent nazis now. We deserve to be shunned and embargoed."
politics,fe4iowr,t1_fe2ht16,1578859745.0,At this point our country is a joke. Welcome to the banana Republic of ignorance.
politics,fdf31ne,t1_fdf18lt,1578352167.0,"Nationalize health care, when people aren't tied to their crappy jobs they will do something else (usually, various reports say 70-80% would immediately look for a new job or just quit). So yes, most don't realize the real expense, however, most are miserable and would take less without having to worry about bankruptcy because of our crappy government. Final thought, if you can't afford staff you have a failed biz already as you economics are bad - need profits to survive no? I don't understand your position here."
MapPorn,fda5xru,t1_fd77a37,1578242146.0,"Supreme Court said go ahead already, this marginalization is built into the system and conservative approved."
unpopularopinion,fda5hch,t1_fd96k0r,1578241948.0,Yet fox is called 'news' for some reason. If it is opinion stop parading b/s propaganda as news.
unpopularopinion,fda50cm,t1_fd8tt0b,1578241762.0,Education is being privatized for profit. De Vos is making sure of that. We are actively making our population dumber for partison b/s. I would love to see more education subsidized with no corporate influence. The current iteration republicans would not exist if that were to happen and the world would be so much safer.
unpopularopinion,fda3roi,t1_fd99r31,1578241346.0,"Whatabout, whatabout, what..... Still not right. Stop watching fox propaganda."

politics,fd9h00t,t1_fd99k7r,1578233197.0,"Not really, how much voter purging and gerrymandering do you have in AL? Quite a lot, there is no democracy / republic here just a bunch of power hungry people and bigots who get to vote while everyone else is marginalized. Our democracy /republic is currupt. Roy Moore is supported by your infrastructure along with numerous other examples of slime."
politics,fd2hj5r,t1_fd2csxj,1578147317.0,At this point we deserve to suffer. We are the bully killing people for ego and election. The rest of the world should sanction us. We are an ignorant and now fascist country. The faster this b/s democracy / republic falls the better the world will be. Elect lying currupt idiots and you get this.
videos,fczq41m,t3_ejh4jl,1578106635.0,"Saw one of his last shows before dying. He was absolutely in bad shape, lots of lost in thought jokes, slurring, etc. Loved his other performances, this was just sad on many levels. Lost opportunity."

politics,fcy4d62,t1_fcxwjtf,1578074557.0,"No we won't, after 3 years of none stop b/s from this administration and it's abhorrent enablers I doubt anything will change. They love their cesspool here and have gerrymandered the country so that 30% keeps winning and stacked the courts. This is dictatorship 101 and our supposed democracy / republic is a disfunctional joke. The rest of the world needs to shun us, they will be better off."

politics,fc95oxb,t1_fc8zc8d,1577547447.0,"That is b/s... The dems invested in our country instead or robbing it. Their budgets cut our bloated military and other pork. Republicans budget is ALL PORK for his cronies (ie saving gm vs bribing farmers for failed initiatives). The party priorities are vastly different and yield different results. Time and again dem proposals are vetted with all involved (unlike every r project where backroom rules) and they help people, not the elite rapping this country. Read their yearly budget proposals, you will see a dramatic difference."

AskMen,fc8qluv,t3_eggyxe,1577540205.0,"In the South they will give you a weird look if you say you don't really follow it, the conversation gets weird. They really don't care about much else, it's practically religion. Other areas of the u.s. you will be fine. The typical moronic sports fan usually has nothing else to talk about except his team, teams he hates, guns, hunting or other b/s macho hobbies. Find a group of chill people without the stupid machismo (nerds are great, beer people are fun, etc..). If you are stuck in an engagement with only sports people, just ask lots of questions. Makes it sound like you care without really caring. Grab a few beers too."
politics,fc6n8qw,t1_fc6lvd4,1577484603.0,"Me too, it's amazing the view of the world when you aren't constantly watching propaganda tv (fox is absolutely the worst, fact based reporting is not in their DNA, hyperbolic b/s is their trade). Anyone still watching cable TV is beyond ignorant, it's propaganda and costs more. Talking to kids who grew up this new way is refreshing - they know fox is full of shit, commercials are rediculous to them and they are really good at calling b/s on republican lying and none of them use cable. It's the boomers and X that are tied to this propaganda driven identity crap. The faster they die and leave this planet the better we will all be."
politics,fc6mj55,t3_egd7tt,1577484104.0,"Every meeting at curruption central is mob Don stealing or otherwise screwing the American taxpayer. He is guilty of so much, has a cult supporting him and likely has dimensia. The faster this trash dies the better for all the world."

politics,fc4saic,t1_fc492eb,1577426539.0,"I would take a bunch of second and third world over this country's spectacular failure the last 3 years. Look at Any global ranking in almost every category the US is failing everywhere. Education, infrastructure and debt relief need to be the focus of our efforts, not ""look there Jethro I just owned the libs with a nonsense argument provided by our puppet masters at fox News."" Ah, so much winning at failing."
worldnews,fc3jkm0,t1_fc3hfj7,1577391217.0,Does not change the fact if they are panicky as you say the world should be immensely concerned if cheeto wins again. Yet here we are with stupid and apathetic citizens doing our best to ignore facts and reality. People need to die to pay attention.
