learnmath,fftzhm3,t1_fftnzt2,1580231123.0,"Thanks for the explanation. I understand how to do the operation now. Just one question regarding this:

>divide the exponent by the index and leaving the remainder under the radical. So if we’re looking for the square root of x5, we divide 5/2


If I understand correctly the index is x and the exponent is 5 so ""dividing the exponent by the index"" would be 5/x no?"

AskReddit,ffm1iq3,t1_ffkioiz,1580047092.0,"So I got really high on 2CB that day. It felt pretty strange. It started off with an actual kaleidoscope effect. Like a movie parody of what an LSD trip is supposed to feel like. Shortly after that I was really overwhelmed by the effect. What I saw and what was reality didn't match. Like I wanted to take something out of the hand of another person but it was like his hand was not in the place where I saw it. That part was all weird but not so bad. Shortly after that though I pretty much lost my sense of orientation completely. I knew something was wrong but I couldn't tell what or where I was. I had this panic and was wondering if I was insane now and even thought that I might already be in a hospital and this is all just playing out in my head. The though of my family seeing me like this and how they felt about me being in this state from now on really messed with my head. 

After a few hours I calmed down and came to my senses. After that I had this creeping anxiety and I wondered if/what lasting damage I got from that  day. Trouble falling asleep because I always thought that something might be wrong. For the longest time I was not able to watch any depictions of mental illness or psychosis in movies because I would get real panic attacks from that alone.

That said, I don't think this was an actual chemical effect from the drugs but more something like post traumatic stress."
AskReddit,ffj5giu,t1_ffivlx3,1579990880.0,I took 2CB once and the dose was apparently immense. I fully lost my mind for a few hours and wasn't back to normal until about a year after that day.
AskReddit,ffj5csb,t1_ffiojyj,1579990806.0,"Huh, I didn't know this was so common. I took a large dose of 2CB (never took this before and the people I was with were very experienced so they mixed monster doses into water). I pretty much lost my mind for a few hours and it took me almost a year to get back to normal. I wasn't going insane but I had a lot of anxiety and had a constant lingering fear of losing my mind after what I experienced that day."
languagelearning,fff25af,t3_et9w9x,1579873643.0,"English has a big influence on the world. It exports a lot of culture in the form of movies, tv shows, video games etc. Most scientific research is conducted in English which results in new advances, technologies and products having English names by default.

In the movie Parasite I think they particularly played on the fact that they hired ""Kevin"" as an English tutor and that ""Jessica"" moved back to Korea from Illinois."

No way. She is a multiple time BJJ world champion. She could have taken the old lady into a chokehold with no opposition but instead choose to punch her until the ref stopped it."

Alistar also works for safe disengage. After the laning phase you can buy Mikael's Crucible to keep your ADC safe."

todayilearned,fds7jkp,t1_fds5q95,1578696131.0,"Mandarin has 1. Polish has 3. To even that out those two languages have other aspects that are complicated. What I am saying is that every language has complicated aspects

People who have many tenses in their own language will have an easier time learning other languages with many tenses."
todayilearned,fdq7i7x,t1_fdq7dxt,1578658142.0,Compare that to a language like Mandarin that (afaik) doesn't conjugate verbs.
todayilearned,fdq44mh,t1_fdpzft1,1578653942.0,"There are many things that make English difficult for people around the world, especially for people who don't speak any indo-european language. Pronunciation can be pretty hard and there is a big disconnect between how words are spelled and pronounced. Also English has 12(!) tenses.

On top of that English has phrasal verbs which a lot of other languages don't have. You have to learn not only the verbs but how their meanings change by adding a preposition."

AskReddit,fdk82ud,t1_fdieu2x,1578498215.0,"I actually just learned a few days ago that there are several flower-related names for Polish women but for whatever reason the name of the strawberry flower is among the ones that can't be used as a name for a child.

Many other countries have regulations on what you can name your child. In Germany the child's name has to be approved to avoid anything ridiculous or embarassing for the child. In Hungary they go one step further and have a list of approved names that you can pick from which mostly includes Hungarian names. You can still pick a name like Jennifer but you would have to spell it the Hungarian way: Dzsennifer."

Ich denke Mal, dass Leute aus Ländern, in denen man zum kacken in die Hocke geht, ein paar Klobrillen kaputt gemacht haben, bis das dort ging.

In Griechenland hängen auch auf jedem Klo Schilder, die darauf hinweisen, dass man Klopapier in den Mülleimer werfen soll und nicht runterspülen (die alten Rohre sind nicht dafür ausgelegt)."
Instagramreality,fceqp15,t1_fcep61v,1577622890.0,Same way apparently every second child can afford a new iPhone regularly. LV has come to realize that they are an aspirational brand for poor people so they cater to them.
