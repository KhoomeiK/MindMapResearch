rant,ffcgzbj,t3_eseaqm,1579799253.0,People who claim they’re feminists but say that women should have more rights or that men are bad aren’t really feminists. Just because some ‘feminists’  say that doesn’t mean that represents the whole idea.

That REALLY pissed me off, especially as she’s my doctor."

I’m not opposed to the idea of yoga and meditation, it’s just that it took me so much to believe that I actually might have something, and as soon as I told her, that all came crumbling down. I’m just in a terrible state of mind rn and I hate life"

rant,fe3fb5t,t1_fe3bobx,1578848770.0,"People have thoughts, and feelings, a personality. That’s exactly why you’d like them, because you connect. The human race has evolved because of empathy and gratitude so saying that you’re objectifying those basic attributes is wrong. If you’re saying that you only like someone for their looks, you are disregarding everything about them which makes them who they are. If someone has a shit personality, but looks great, you wouldn’t be friends with them. It’s the same thing"

bisexual,fe34c1s,t1_fe2eqln,1578845824.0,So pans (lol) aren’t attracted to different genders in different ways then? And bi people are? Is that correct? Thanks for responding btw
rant,fe33but,t1_fe2e703,1578845531.0,No not everyone objectifies others. Liking a person for their personality and not just their looks is not objectifying them. So how would everyone objectify?

bisexual,fe24pe3,t1_fdzblxn,1578834416.0,"Ok legitimate question here from someone who’s trying to figure out their sexuality, please don’t hate on me. There’s a clear line between gay and bi (gay likes one gender bi likes boys and girls), but isn’t the line between bi and pan kinda blurred? Like a lot of people I know say they’re bi but would date any gender, so what I guess I’m asking is, is how big is the difference? I really hope this didn’t come off as rude. Thanks"

rant,fe1y8i6,t1_fe1g4h2,1578832249.0,"You’re objectifying a girl of you only want her for sex. I’m not saying that you can’t have hookups, but they were friends from before, and talked. It makes people feel terrible when you find out that that’s all they wanted from the beginning"

depression,fe0hl8r,t1_fduni41,1578813552.0,I know you have good intentions but for future don’t give anyone who’s struggling with mental illness an inspirational quote. People hate that and it will do more bad than good
depression,fe0h2pa,t1_fdzq4ua,1578813333.0,"I feel the exact same way, every part that you described is like me. I have no idea what’s normal since I have nothing to compare to so I’m also always have those circling thoughts of am I depressed or an attention seeker?"

I’m so scared of someone noticing my scars at school or at home cuz then they’ll ask me about it. Idk why I’m like this, I push away everyone, even my one and only friend who is super sweet and cares about me. I also think I’m bi but it’s so frustrating not knowing cuz I’ve never had even a kiss with anyone and I feel like I’ll never know cuz nobody likes me. Thanks for listening I’m kinda just saying stuff cuz nobody talks to me so sorry abt that lmao"
KindVoice,fcj9u9x,t3_ehfajg,1577680873.0,"14 F here. Lately I’ve been really sad, and most of the time idek why. I’ve been wondering if my constant sadness and emptiness is something  like depression, but every time I do I hate myself for thinking like that because there’s people who are actually struggling with it and I’m probably just a moody teen. Then I hate myself for hating myself and it’s a downward spiral. Damn that sounds so stupid. I feel like I can’t talk to even caring people for some reason, even when they ask. My brother was asking me if I ever did self harm and I said no, but all I had to do was roll up my sleeves and show my scars. I don’t even have a hard or bad life, it’s honestly perfect which doesn’t help my self esteem since I know there’s no reason to hate my life. So sorry for ranting this much, I needed that vent"
