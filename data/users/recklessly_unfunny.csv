TwoXChromosomes,fexw6o2,t1_fexseua,1579437474.0,You’ve dealt with an emergency c-section. That trumps a 10 minute office visit and sitting on a bag of frozen peas for a day or two.
TwoXChromosomes,fexvwz1,t3_eqvcms,1579437331.0,"I’d recommend talking with your doctor about an IUD such as the Mirena. It releases *very* low levels of hormones locally so you shouldn’t have the side effects you have on the pill. Periods are much lighter or gone altogether. It’s over 99% effective and lasts up to 5 years. 

I’m on my second one and it has been a great choice for me. Best of luck!"
memes,fextf4z,t3_eqvfht,1579435734.0,Cake day!
memes,fes9mjk,t1_ferfyi0,1579362937.0,"Great advice! I’d also add that your career doesn’t define you. You may never be passionate about it but if you find something that doesn’t sap your soul completely, you’re on your way to working to live (not the other way around). And that’s a good place to be. Don’t give up on yourself before you get started."
facepalm,fes837v,t3_eqe1o9,1579362377.0,"Waiting 10 seconds for your brain to catch up  before letting your inside voice out saves a lot of embarrassment.

Or so I’ve heard. I can’t seem to do it."
worldpolitics,fes784e,t1_fepg6eg,1579362127.0,I like that one. The world would be a much better place.
facepalm,fe6jb6z,t3_env2nj,1578892732.0,Bet they’re looking for someone with “a keen eye for details” too.
dataisbeautiful,fe6j6tw,t1_fe65tnf,1578892615.0,"Canadian here and I think we are on the British side of this. To me “quite good” indicates some surprise that something is good, which lowers the goodness."
AskReddit,fd309z8,t1_fd0akur,1578153492.0,"That is horrifying!

You might have felt powerless at the time, but you are a survivor.  “And though she be but little she is fierce!”"

AskReddit,fd0h6r8,t1_fd04ras,1578118738.0,OMG that is awful and hilarious.
australia,fcujde1,t1_fcu1xx0,1577982332.0,"Just because she didn’t outwardly react doesn’t mean she knew him or wanted him to touch her. Some women feel like it’s impolite to make waves even if they feels gross about it. Or just kind of freeze with bile rising in her throat.

That guy comes across as a patronizing ass.

AskReddit,fcui2yf,t1_fctkd36,1577981476.0,"That is powerful. I like to think that your pup was able to give her some comfort. 

I had a similar experience when a friend died of cancer when we were teenagers. I dreamt that he was sitting on my bed telling me not to worry about him because he was going to be ok. I found out the next day that he had passed away during the night."
agedlikemilk,fcsvqut,t1_fcraiga,1577926340.0,Doesn’t bother me one bit.
gifs,fcor63t,t3_ei725b,1577839346.0,"That is so, so sad."
todayilearned,fcor0i6,t1_fcoeqn8,1577839233.0,"Or an underlying problem that needs more security to fix than $2,000 can deliver."
aww,fcmsfxp,t1_fcmdpla,1577790004.0,Me too. Love this!
aww,fcjh6u1,t3_ehgbnr,1577687457.0,She looks so beautiful and relaxed! What a wonderfully happy ending for both of you.
AskReddit,fcjecf6,t1_fcjaj7b,1577684601.0,My deepest sympathy to you and your family. Take good care.
AskReddit,fcjeb1h,t1_fcj5rsd,1577684569.0,Sometimes hanging in there is all you can ask and a big victory. Be gentle on yourself and take care.
Guitar,fcjdl2f,t3_ehcr8c,1577683920.0,Nice!!! I always got a mandarin orange in the toe of my stocking as a kid. This is even tastier!!
Guitar,fc3ylkp,t3_effxq4,1577401983.0,"What a great post and philosophy. Thank you! 

I got my first guitar for Christmas and am so anxious to make music with it. I have played the piano for a million years or so (I’m old) but this is rekindling my passion for music in a big way.

Good reminder about fighting those feelings of frustration. Everything is new and like a different language. I keep mentally trying to translate tabs into notes on a staff. It will be cool when it becomes second nature.

I’m trying out the Fender lessons app and it is good so far. Pretty stoked to now know 2 (one-finger) chords."
Guitar,fc3xovt,t1_fc0k5vm,1577401301.0,Thanks so much for this!
insaneparents,fb6rxpi,t1_fb5k9q5,1576558407.0,My deepest condolences to you. Please take care of yourself.
