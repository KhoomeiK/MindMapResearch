emacs,feeppz1,t1_feeoi46,1579038618.0,My question would be: why would you need to use org-mode ? Sort information? Journaling? Writing? I mean... I think .org mode can actually do more than the pieces of software and functionality you mentioned. Also .org mode files will probably remain readable for ever if you are thinking in terms of posterity.

raisedbynarcissists,fe6uc3f,t1_fdqqaoh,1578905356.0,"Muahaha, did that a couple of times. Ended up in confrontation, which is what she was looking for. Destroying stuff made me being called ""crazy"", ""mad"" or ""irresponsible"". Though I admit that it feels so good to burst out into anger sometimes, it is relieving. I have to read more on that very topic. Coping with those people is puzzling, maddening. What's your story with Nparents u/ReasonReader?"
bipolar,fe6t7un,t3_enzxes,1578904317.0,"I am in the case of your girlfriend except that I am a male. My wife does not have BPD. Sorry to be crude, but do not be afraid to ask her to wank you if you need it badly. Do not wait. And when she turns hypersexual, and you are not in the mood, please her, wank her the best you can. There is nothing worse than frustration in a relationship. Talking helps a lot. We are human with needs, and accumulating sexual tension will probably turn into a quarrel. 

Let's say that she is a very low mood in bed, and does not feel like eating at all. Try to offer her just a small piece of fruit. You don't have to cook a whole breakfast she will obviously reject. Be patient and try the ""baby step"" approach. My wife has been so understanding towards me. I can't thank her enough for that. 

I also want to add: having a very low or very high sex drive is not easy for the partner. If she is in a low phase, you feel probably like you will never get what you need. Iif she is turning hypersexual, she will never get enough from you. Let's say you had intercourse and she is asking for more, give her more, the best you can, wank her, spank her, pee on her, I don't know, ask her what she would like. She may not necessary need your cock again and again. Sex does not only go through penetration. 

But please *talk*. Therefore you will both know if you can stick together for a lifetime. Hope it helps!"

assholedesign,fdqou57,t1_fdqmbjw,1578671664.0,"I love to give them a call and pretend to be tech support as well, while faking an Indian accent.

raisedbynarcissists,fdqhuhd,t1_fdqdsna,1578667044.0,"My nmom used to play the radio loud to wake me up. Told her a million times that I was hating loud radio speech as an alarm clock (I ended up setting up an alarm clock 30 min before she wake up). Also she used to love pouring cereals and milk into a bowl, in order to ""prepare"" my breakfast, my cereals ending up soupy. I was used to yell ""I hate when you do that: I love my cereals crunchy!!! Not soupy!!!"". Then she decided to add some ""healthy"" ingredients to my cereals, like some kind of organic oat flakes, making my breakfast taste like shit. I had to dispose it into the sink in anger. That used to make her laugh. Just thinking about it flips me back into wrath.

raisedbynarcissists,fdq7o5q,t1_fdq6yj8,1578658327.0,"So bad!!! My mother used to enter my room without warning, throw my cleaned laundry in bulk at me and say: “put it away now or I’ll do it for you”. Of course my laundry was crumpled (ironing mine was too much work for her) and my friends at school used to make fun out of me for wearing bad looking garment. Looking back it is so weird and mean to do that to a child. Definitely a case of abuse. 

When I turned 16 she met a dude and went cruising with him for weeks, leaving me alone by myself. Not 1 trip but trips one after another. I recently ran into her photo albums of her trips. Some of the letters she wrote me were glued in the book. Only selfish talk. One letter ends with “I am wishing you happy”. That’s the sole line she was mentioning me. Of course I was happy: I was lone, doing drugs, alcohol, self harm... sorry for the long rant. It still hurts in spite of all the work done in therapy."
raisedbynarcissists,fdq74li,t1_fdq6wyf,1578657715.0,"Can’t recall what she said accurately but I replied “you made me cross-wired (I have bipolar disorder), my day-to-day life can become extremely difficult, so thank you for that.”"
raisedbynarcissists,fdq6l1v,t1_fdq6eo1,1578657088.0,Totes. That’s why I don’t get angry at her anymore. At least I try. Thanks to psychoanalysis I can fight back without freaking out. My kids are proud of me for that. They told their mother: “dad doesn’t get dominated anymore”. Man... it is such a tough issue.
raisedbynarcissists,fdq5zjs,t1_fdq3opq,1578656363.0,"You are reminding me a story: when I was living at my mother’s house there was 2 bathrooms. One next to my room (2nd floor) and another one on the ground floor. My f Nmother took a malignant pleasure to come to the upstairs bathroom when I was sleeping to take a pee, and flush the toilet. One night it drove me crazy and I bumped the wall with my heel so hard in anger, she freaked out. She rushed into my room and was like “is that you who did that?”  Me: “no”. Her “we are cohabiting!!” (What are word!). Me: “Fuck you!”  She slammed the door. That did not prevent her from doing it again and waking me up in the middle of the night. I used to blame her for doing it again and again, though she always came up with a good excuse for doing it. Nparents are insane."

raisedbynarcissists,fdq05yx,t3_emj7k1,1578648320.0,"Again my latter comment has probably nothing to do with your story, but I know that very tone Nparents have with their kids. My Nmother is always soooo nice on the phone. When I was a kid she used to try to bind with my friends when they were calling. So you struck a chord within me with your story."
raisedbynarcissists,fdpzz5z,t3_emj7k1,1578648052.0,"My Nmom keeps hanging up on me. Day before yesterday we had to meet. Before coming she did it again. I said in a very quiet voice: “why did you hang up on me?” (direct confrontation). She didn’t see that coming, and was like: “uuuh I thought you were done talking”. Me again remaining quiet: “you have been doing that for ever when you are upset at me, I know you are.” I did not want to rant any further, carrying water to her mill, like I used to, 
Blocked in her own dead end, she began to fake as if nothing happened. 
Thanks to this sub (and some reading) I can now let my Nmother visit her grandchildren from time to time without freaking out. It is a huge step for me. 
Stay strong my friends !!  You are not alone with your f Nparent."
