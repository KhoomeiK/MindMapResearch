dogs,ff9osjt,t3_esfiax,1579717515.0,What about a small dog. May be less scary for your GF.  There has to be some reason she is afraid. I can see someone more likely bieng scared of a bully breed or shepard rather than a 10lb Yorkie or Chihuahua.
dogs,ff9nn8c,t3_esbsqf,1579716780.0,"We have a section of our yard that is gravel that we trained our pup to use and now she is just let out and goes exactly there. Its engrained into her brain now. It's like a big litterbox in a way. Started off by using a leash and walking her out to it, and rewarding when she went.

(previous owner put the gravel down, I think they just didnt want to mow over a drain pipe, around AC unit and window egresses on a small sliver of yard)."
reactivedogs,ff6n8am,t3_eqyqu0,1579630800.0,"I have had a dog agressive adopted pitbull, once I understood this after 2 scuttles at the dog park (dont remember why I went a second time after that, wasn't smart of me), just didnt let him near other dogs. He wasn't bad if just passing by dogs and both fights I think happened over a dog toy in the park. If I knew better at that time I also would have used a muzzle on walks. But it wasn't a deal breaker.

Human agression is a hard-no. I love dogs, but if I would rather deal with the heartbreak of a putting down a dog, than that of knowing a person was hurt, disfigured or dead from my dog."

dogs,fdhcngt,t1_fdhbnkm,1578419996.0,"True, may be different when young kids are involved. If anything even if there is not any more of a risk than a normal dog, I can see how it may be too stressful to think about the what-ifs and not leave kids to break up dog fights.
 
Has to be carefully considered. I had a dog reactive/selective rescue pitbull, but in a 2 adult household. But we just managed it keeping him on a leash, and walking in quiet areas. Very affectionate to humans."
dogs,fdhaoem,t1_fdh40hy,1578418974.0,"Just be careful becuase too high of potency can permanently damage a dog, even human grade is risky too, especially if your dog is caught in the pepper spray crossfire. But bear would be overkill for all involved."
dogs,fdha2r1,t1_fdgygyq,1578418638.0,Dog aggression does not mean also people agression.  Lots of dog reactive dogs that are fine with people.
dogs,fdh9u2k,t3_el4u0u,1578418491.0,"Why I started carrying pepper spray with me last week (small bottle, fits in my pocket). 
Bonus, can also use it on a potential creeper human too."
Dogtraining,fczqtzn,t3_ejc69e,1578107033.0,"I would have him return the dog to his ex for not only your dogs safety and the pitbulls benefit. Pitbulls have a disposition to be dog agressive, and are much happier in a human only household with lots of exercise and mental stimulation (I have owned a full pit and now have a pit mix). 12 hours a day alone and not enough execise is bordering animal cruelty and that dog will snap.

Ive given up a dog to an ex before becuase it was better for the dogs lifestyle, and I dont regret it at all. Needs to be a one dog house if your dog is reactive (of course work on that too but it'll take time)."
pitbulls,fck7nw7,t3_ehh1qa,1577718858.0,Cute. Does he have some Great Dane in him too?
dogs,fcimisk,t3_eh94sz,1577665054.0,I think he eventually will eat out of it when he gets really hungry. Could put some yummy treats in with his food to entice him over.
dogs,fcim84b,t1_fchhdyh,1577664915.0,"Sounds like they had a stainless and misplaced it, used a ceramic temporarily, and then bought the same exact model stainless bowl and still have issues.

If the original was truly missing forever. Would be hard to get it back."
dogs,fcikkzo,t3_ehdig5,1577664120.0,"Funny enough, your dog looks Just like the Pitbull Mix in the movie ""A Dogs Way Home"".

Should do a Dog DNA test, like Embark. We did it with our Pitmix and she had 6+ different breeds in  her."
puppy101,fc4ga59,t3_efxq2h,1577415798.0,I've stepped on my puppies paws probably 3 or 4  times already by accident (she is 8 months soon). Just apologize and pet her. She hasn't shown any fear or odd behaviors because of it.
DoggyDNA,fc1mxsd,t1_fc11765,1577323604.0,I had a pretty good idea because she looks like my pit boxer mix :)
dogs,fbstugz,t3_ee26d5,1577060427.0,Call your vet or late night ER vet. They sometimes can give you an answer that it's not an emergency. We called when our pup ate a dryer sheet and they told us just watch and let it pass on the phone.
