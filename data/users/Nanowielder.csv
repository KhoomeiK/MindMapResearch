AskReddit,ffgi3p6,t1_ffghy20,1579906742.0,"May or May not be a little drunk. I tried my best, I swear!"
AskReddit,ffgd3sw,t1_ffgc0gk,1579903569.0,"Literally didn't get a compliment once after I got told I smell nice 10 years ago. Got the same compliment recently and it is was like ""damn, has it really been that long?""

And no, I did wash regularly and keep myself clean."
Stellaris,fffzz05,t1_fffqfu7,1579895487.0,Biolumuniescent? Is that a mod?
reddeadredemption,ff9o3pc,t1_ff9mmvp,1579717051.0,One is a story mission but you can choose not to do it once you arrive. The rest are optional.
doctorwho,fezsssh,t1_fei2uru,1579461194.0,"I like him more because I can relate to the dude in a way. His character speaks to me in a way Rose, Donna, or River never could. Cheesy? Probably."
doctorwho,fezqaoc,t1_feyqxw6,1579460303.0,That's not suffocation. That's Carbon Dioxide poisoning. You technically haven't ran out of air and can still breath because said air is still reaching your lungs and blood. You've just ran out of breathable air and have thus become poisoned.
doctorwho,fezp3jw,t1_fet5ex9,1579459892.0,Matt too with his adventures with Stormageddon!
witcher,fetrjyj,t1_fetf8bq,1579378988.0,"Which makes them great characters. Although, the Netflix series really made go for yen."
DestinyTheGame,fetr2sr,t1_fesmxg2,1579378640.0,Spent money once on the Thorn ornament. Still way over priced though. This was well before they removed the matrix thingy and well before they announced free to play.
doctorwho,fetch7j,t1_fet4yr9,1579373905.0,"I get why people don't like the ""fam"" thing but I kinda like it. It's her little thing she has with her companions. Like an inside joke or something similar. We have to remember, Doctor is an alien. Yes they've been around humans for thousands of years but let's not forget 11 was different from your average human and 12 was very social awkward to the point they had no social skills."
doctorwho,fesu0hn,t1_feoju7u,1579368960.0,"Imagine that. The doctor walks by a mirror after regenerating and keeps walking. Suddenly, they double take and start screaming in joy that they're finally a ginger."
doctorwho,festcah,t3_eqct6r,1579368839.0,"I predicted 13 would be trying to move on from everything they've done and keep true to who she really is. 

Now that the master has come back she's finally reminded again of what's happened and that her home is gone once again."
reddeadredemption2,fesif4l,t1_fekgnvl,1579365502.0,I told you I'd put your mother in black on your behalf!

hacking,fegwy6q,t3_ep42cu,1579104381.0,"Okay. For starters, Dark Web and Deep Web are different things.

Dark Web is a part of the Web that can only be accessed through passwords/special software. So, even your everyday website could technically be a part of the Dark Web.

Deep Web is websites and Web pages that aren't indexed by search engines. So, a website you cannot easily search for using Google or Yahoo for instance.

Now secondly, just because you've been on the Dark/Deep Web does not mean you've been around hackers or criminals. Depending on what your friend went on, he is most certainly safe and not considered a criminal."
Warframe,fcyp76j,t1_fcy4t6d,1578084285.0,"His 4 helps with survivability too. Use your 3 on an enemy and then place down a 4. Not only are you taking reduced damage, your regenerating more health than they can take away."
Warframe,fcyf58k,t1_fcyedcw,1578079147.0,Yes that is cannon. I think the sentient coat is what drove him mad eventually.

xbox,fck8zyy,t1_fck5pf1,1577719838.0,"OP: ""kid you shouldn't do this you, you might get scammed!""

The other guy: ""No, I'm the one trying to scam you!!""


In all seriousness though, OP has got their head screwed on and their heart is in the right place. Props to OP."
xbox,fck8qty,t1_fck6vc9,1577719660.0,"Microsoft allows for children of all ages really. However, if you make an account you are required to make and/or link an adult account. The adult account determines what you can and can't do. Such as, messaging people."
depression,fcjyzti,t1_fciets3,1577711123.0,"Nah bro, clearly you're nihilistic for having those thoughts /s. 

OP don't know what it's like man. Having to constantly remind yourself of positive thoughts because the negative ones are too natural and reoccurring, ain't a ""realization"". Thinking that you're the worst human on the planet because you didn't hold the door open properly for your friend isn't a ""realization"". Ruining friendships because you think they hate you ain't a fucking realization."
Journaling,fciq6lj,t3_ehefv7,1577667196.0,I got one for Christmas. I immediately started using it but that's because to me the new year doesn't mean that much to me.
depression,fcipxeh,t1_fcgncw9,1577667028.0,"I've recently done this. I lashed out over jealousy and anger. It's taken weeks to remedy the situation and tell them they mean so much to me but I finally was able to get them back again. Not entirely, but with work things can go back to normal. 

You just have to be patient with them and let them know about how you feel in a calm manner about the situation."
depression,fciorpj,t1_fcff0kw,1577666296.0,"Exactly. OP sounds like they have an environmental type of depression rather  than genetic.

Or more likely, they're nihilistic."
jurassicworldevo,fcg59b0,t1_fcft98y,1577636599.0,"Hmmmm yes, this floor appears to be made of floor!"
DestinyLore,fcfzq5k,t1_fcfi314,1577635177.0,Death and taxes are the only guaranteed things in the universe. By this logic The Darkness and The Taxman are the true threats to the universe.
HaloStory,fcfa2y8,t1_fcdls6o,1577627943.0,"Hey I was very young when teach came out so what I'm about to say is really fucking stupid.

When Reach came out I thought it was a sequal to Halo 3. So, I thought the Elites betrayed humanity after siding with them. And that when 4 came out Chief was surprised that the Elites weren't working with Humans anymore.

I now know that to be so untrue and I was wrong on so many levels."
halo,fc8nsac,t1_fc7x5g1,1577538675.0,I've never been hard over a car before...
FORTnITE,fc8njd2,t3_egoanz,1577538542.0,Is it possible to learn the template for this meme?

memes,fc5w2nz,t1_fc5vg2e,1577467120.0,I think it's a qoute from Shakespeare. It was posted in a meme and then it just took off.
rickandmorty,fc5t4ge,t1_fc5onnr,1577465281.0,Was just about to say privacy.com does this very same thing. Is it available outside of the US or just US only?
memes,fc33ruu,t1_fc2m352,1577380753.0,1 species going extinct or 1000 going extinct? Neither should happen. Both are just a tragic imo.
ImpracticalJokers,fc31b6z,t1_fc22b7p,1577379189.0,He's a child stuck in an old man's body but he makes it work like a super car.

fo4,fc2ei4t,t1_fc28p51,1577355560.0,"New Vegas had a reference to the Silence in the Library double episode. The walking skeletons in space suits (I can't remember their names) would say ""Hey, who turned out the lights?!"".

You could only get it with the Wild Wasteland perk."
