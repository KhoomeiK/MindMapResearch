todayilearned,fej9veg,t1_fej8wep,1579163296.0,"Add crucifixion to this list.. Apparantly one of the nastiest ways to go :p

First you get a jagged nail jammed through your carpal tunnel - imagine hitting your funny bone in the elbow - but all the time, being unable to move. In both arms - all the way from wrist to shoulder. 
Every whack with the sledge intensifying the pain until the surprisingly long nail holds you tight, then second arm for good measure.. 

Then they do the same with your legs- either one nail through both ankles or one through each - both hitting the same nerve in the leg for the jarring horrible sensation. 

You're then lifted up and the standing part is slid some feet in to a hole in a very un-gentle manner - most likely with a horrible impact at the end.

While you hang there in a most brutal fashion, pain and horrible sensations through both arms and both legs, you begin to suffocate after a while. You simply cannot stand the pain so you relax and start to suffocate. the human body on the other hand really doesn't want to die - so you jolt awake, putting pressure on the nails to stand up and gasp for breath. only to endure a bit longer, start to faint, suffocate, wake, feel pain, endure etc. 

The method of death is so horrid they even invented a new word for the pain - ""excruciating"""

AskReddit,fdwwe05,t1_fdwtf1g,1578762942.0,">>Historian Helen King has found no evidence that doctors ever masturbated their patients as a hysteria treatment in ancient or classical times (6). Hallie Lieberman, author of “Buzz: The Stimulating History of the Sex Toy,” told me that even if it did exist, clitoral massage was not a common medical procedure. After extensive research, Lieberman has never found any proof of a doctor using a vibrator to stimulate a patient’s clitoris to “paroxysm” or orgasm.

>>So what was Granville’s vibrator for?

>>It was designed to treat pain, headaches, irritability, indigestion, and constipation—in men.

>>Lieberman points out that Granville knew the vibrator could have sexual uses, and even used it to treat male sexual dysfunction, but he never used it on women(8).

>>At this time, hand crank models like Dr. Macaura’s “Pulsocon” were popular, due to their low cost and lack of need for a power source. The Pulsocon was marketed as a Blood Circulator, which could “stop pain quickly and cure chronic sufferers.”

atleast according to [source](https://helloclue.com/articles/culture/a-short-history-of-the-vibrator)"
