By waiting they will reduce the migration overhead which they would probably have between 3.1 and 5 anyways.

Targeting depends on what system you really want to target (e.g. 32Bit, 64Bit) Is it Windows only?

Saving Configurations: Again depends on what you want to achieve. When using Windows-Forms/WPF Applications there are default mechanisms on using configuration files. But you can always roll your own mechanisms if you desire.

Permission Levels: What is the application going to do? Do you need read/write access to folders other than your own application folder(subfolders)? 

When it comes to deployment for Windows there are some installer frameworks you can use for deployment. One of them is WiX (which is free but can be very frustrating in setting up). But there are others as well. However installers, in my experience are always some kind of hassle to say the least.

Then as an alternative there is always the so called ""X-Copy"" Deployment, where the deployment is just consisting of copying the binaries into some folder of your own choosing and running it. (This of course works only if your application is fully self contained and does not use of other external dependcies, e.g. reporting tools, database engines etc.)"
