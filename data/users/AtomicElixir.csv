relationship_advice,ff9xep7,t1_ff9wmpc,1579723588.0,"It's not the ideal situation, but if your sister isn't willing to just be upfront with them, I would suggest seeing if you can't afford to get an air bnb. They aren't that expensive ( I know, not always the best option or even possible when money is tight), but could be something to look in to. You are a grown adult and it's rediculous to have that kind of request in someone else's home. Especially when you have had the plans beforehand."
relationship_advice,ff9wva9,t3_esh5l6,1579723256.0,"You know, I've had issues with this in the past. I've been with my current boyfriend for almost a year now. He and I have known eachother over 5 years at this point, so it's not like he and I didnt know each other that well when we started getting together. At the very beginning (even with him being my best friend), things were very difficult for me. I was disgusted of myself for liking someone and the fear of a future made it hard to stay connected to him. I got over it once I felt security in the relationship. It's SO hard to accept liking someone and I totally understand. I would start out small and share small things like your music if you don't already. Find some things you guys have in common and maybe find something to do together that can help you find a connection. I love video games personally, especially team building type of games. Anyway, it's hard to let people in. Having people care in our life that matters makes it hard to let people in, but if you can't make the connection, it's hard for the other person to stay invested. I hope some other people also have some good tips. Dating is supposed to be fun. So go find some adventures to go on :)"
relationship_advice,ff9w4yf,t3_esgxfa,1579722809.0,"Wow, that super sucks. I wish people would be adults instead of ghosting.


I'd probably just shoot him a text (nothing too dramatic, if that is what you are going for.. to avoid drama) and just state that you dislike the way he went about the situation, but you'd like to be able to not feel weird about going to social events you both may attend. Idk, it's such a touchy thing. I'd give it more time, maybe? Not sure what the best way to get closure would be.

I'm sorry you're going through this. Why are grown ass adults pulling shit like this? Seriously, I can see someone my age (mid 20's) ghosting people, but man, I hope by the time I'm in my 30's, people have enough decency to just be honest. All he had to do was be clear and things wouldn't have made it so weird at social events. It seems like most of the issues people have on this subreddit is their lack of communication. Crazy how much a discussion or two could at least help the situation. I hope you're able to still enjoy going to hang out with mutual friends. Try not to let it get the best of you, especially with alcohol. We all know how that can impact our reactions/ emotions."

relationship_advice,ff76g4s,t3_es16pb,1579642052.0,"Honestly, it sounds like more than a few issues that could occur here. I would decline. Especially this soon after their breakup. If this friend were to find out, it would almost guarantee your loss of their friendship. 


People have three-ways all of the time, but I personally wouldn't. It can cause problems and sometimes lead to people breaking up. I don't have experience with a three way, but I feel like a lot of ground rules would need to be set."
relationship_advice,ff6b02n,t3_erwm6y,1579623244.0,"You are right. He is definitely wrong about how consent works. When a person says they don't want to continue, you stop. You don't ask questions and you don't push to go further.

I don't understand what it would be like to be in your position, but don't get too down on yourself because you haven't dated/ have sex with anyone. You are currently working on a future for yourself and that is super awesome! Just keep maintaining the friendships you have and keep working toward your studies.

relationship_advice,ff4f7ml,t3_erkx7m,1579562172.0,"Maybe next time it happens, ask him about it when you see him. See what he says. Seems kind of suspicious, but maybe it is some sort of weird glitch from phone pictures to snapchat. If he is actually lying, it's probably not innocent lies. Regardless of a lie, it's not usually a positive thing and none of us should want to be in a relationship with a liar. It will break your trust with your future relationships. Trust me, I know. The less baggage for yourself, the better."

Better not to get involved. I did tell them the next time I saw them, if they came by again. It's probably not personal and definitely don't feel bad about giving him the note. It could've been a really good outcome for you and so it shouldn't prevent you from saying anything to a crush on the future. Rejection happens. It could've been a million things!"
relationship_advice,ff4crtn,t3_erkz16,1579560560.0,"Even if you were being illogical, your feelings are still valid and he should at least try to understand. You know, asking questions as to WHY you feel this way and try to meet in the middle as to what can help improve the issue. He is also not having a productive conversation with you and is just being an asshole.. someone else suggested gaslighting and they may be on to something."

college,ff3q94x,t3_erf74t,1579546518.0,"I noticed this too when I was living in a college town and lived in some apartments by the school. There were a ton of stray cats around the place. 

If you also get a pet, realize they may need extra care when they get older. When I first got my pets, I didn't think too hard about the future. Now that I'm going to school, one of my pets started getting really ill. He ended up having unstable blood sugar (insulinoma) and can have seizures. He has to take 3 medicines, twice a day and fed some extra protein with one of his meds. This is costing me UPWARD of $200 a month with the monthly vet visit. I was already financially struggling. All of that being said, if you make the choice to get the pet, you should take the commitment seriously. These animals depend on us and they don't deserve neglect/ abandonment due to our impulsive decisions. Since my little buddy got sick, it's been hard making sure I'm home in time to give him his meds and making any plans outside of going to college."
EngineeringStudents,fei57np,t1_fehpecl,1579130546.0,"Yeah, it'd be nice to get one, but I'm unfortunately not in a position to be able to do so.

EngineeringStudents,fehncv6,t3_ep53ox,1579120042.0,"There's definitely a lot to consider. I do think I'd prefer mechanical, but the research I want to do is more on the material science end. Thanks for the advice! I'm just trying to figure out what in the hell I'm doing so I don't have to back track for the classes I need for my APE.

relationship_advice,feh5hk0,t3_ep530d,1579109552.0,"I think you have good reason to be concerned. The showering thing isn't concerning because maybe she just wants the peace and there isn't anything wrong with that. Her being more affectionate however, is not a great sign imo. She may just be stressed, but what I'd mostly be concerned about is her comments and ""jokes"". Though they may be playful, they are still obviously impacting you and the security you feel in your relationship. This is something that I think would benefit talking about to make sure you guys are okay. Just be direct and maybe tell her those jokes have been concerning you. Checking in is good. I occasionally take the time to ask my boyfriend "" hey, do you still like me? Do you still want to be with me"". I try to open up the conversation because I think he's less likely to bring it up and I'm just making sure we are on the same page. Maybe don't ask her what I ask my boyfriend because I've had partners in the past get mad when I ask them that. You could possibly just say, "" hey, I wanted to check in and see how you are feeling about our relationship. I've been noticing some behavior (be specific) that has been concerning me that you are having some doubts about our relationship"". When you say this, just reassure her so that way she doesn't think you are projecting feelings you're having. If you want the jokes to stop, it would be wise to just say they are bothering you and youd like her to be more conscious when she's making these types of jokes. 
I hope this helps. Good luck with your lady"
socialskills,fedvw4y,t1_fe98qga,1579021000.0,"Yeah, unfortunately that's been my experience too. I was studying with these three girls for a math class one semester and they talked about wanting to stay ""friends"" afterward, but haven't heard from any of them since. Except for one. She and I run in to eachother every once in awhile on campus. I didn't really click with them super well though. 

As for the talking to someone after sitting next to them, I failed that yesterday because I didn't go to my class early enough lol. Im going to try again today. I hope you've had some luck!"
BipolarReddit,fedshh5,t3_eolj4u,1579018936.0,"I had kidney stones for YEARS and most of the doctors I saw would put off my abdominal pain as being ""in my head"" because my PTSD was acting up. They started making me think I was crazy, but I just couldn't believe my brain was making all of these false pains. It was difficult because they'd do a test or an ultrasound and find nothing. Finally, after years of inconsistently seeing new doctors, I was so sick I couldn't even stand to walk to the bathroom. I went to urgent Care for the second time in 3 weeks and then they did a blood panel, which then had me sent to the ER where they had to surgically remove my stone. Now that I'm feeling sick (in a different area) I'm scared to go spend the money to be told that nothing is wrong. 

Im so glad you fought them on the testing. Now you have answers"

socialskills,fe96q5p,t3_eo6pmf,1578934878.0,"You should go sit next to some people (like in between them) once you sit, you can introduce yourself and ask what their names are. It helps break the ice and sometimes they may start to engage in a conversation.
I am also majoring in the STEM field and I've been able to form study groups this way, but have yet to make any friends. Honestly, study groups have helped me be more successful so I've never regretted talking to anyone. 

I'm going back to college today and I'm very anxious myself! I'm working myself up to be social haha. You're definitely not the only one. I think there are probably far more people than we know that actually want to make friends. So let's hope we both find some cool new classmates this semester"

relationship_advice,fe0upns,t3_enkwej,1578818877.0,"My therapist has helped encourage me to try and go out more. It's about exposing yourself to things that make you uncomfortable. Not saying to constantly force yourself to be anxious. That could lead to a panic attack. Just being able to recognize your limits and leaving a situation before you get close to having a panic attack. This dinner/ other activities, is it going to be in the same city? If it's in the same city, you could just go to the dinner. Just give him a heads up and hopefully he will respect it. If you can't do that, just let him know what's going on and tell him that you still want to celebrate his birthday, but would like to get together to do something else. If you end up doing this, maybe put some thought into what you guys could do, that way you still show that you care about him. (like going to the arcade or something) something that isn't going to be as hard on you.

It may just be a really healthy relationship so far :)"
relationship_advice,fdrpkv7,t3_emwelz,1578687763.0,"That sounds really suspicious. I know jealousy can come off as unattractive, but you should also be able to show concern. I think a loving partner (or one I'd want to be with) would reassure you and make you feel secure in the relationship. I think a partner may be a bit offended that the accusation was there, but they should be able to handle that in a mature way. Even if he isn't cheating, it still sounds like he's being dishonest about how much he talks to her. This is definitely not okay.. 

Since this is more of a touchy subject, maybe you could just bring up that you think he's being dishonest as to how close they actually are. I would think my SO would at least bring their work associates up occasionally when they work closely together. Idk. If you find he's cheating, do yourself a favor and leave. Staying with someone who cheats will just pull you apart. Unless you are able to fully forgive.  Hopefully that is not the case."

Please think of your wife and don't stay with someone you feel like leaving all of the time. It's unfair to you and to her. 

Therapy is never a bad option either if you are having issues and may need to learn to communicate better. Maybe you could salvage your relationship and fall back in love with your wife. Be on the pursuit of happiness. Your kids can't really have the best childhood in a household with parents who don't love eachother anymore. Good luck man.

I'm desperate for work right now ( lost most of my hours due to a client I work with moving away) and it's so hard for me to actually send in applications. I think to myself, "" this job is probably too draining for me"" and I end up not applying, even if it may be a good fit. I try not to overwhelm myself, but I have school full time. Wish I didn't have tuition to pay off. It'd be great to just focus entirely on school. Bipolar disorder seriously feels like a full time job in itself.

I've been feeling all sorts of depressed so it's hard for me to be like ""Yeah, I'm great and you definitely want me here"". If you go and figure out it's not for you, then you can decline the offer if that's the case. You may find it to be a really good thing though and maybe you'll love the job. Overall, it could be good practice.

Anyway, I'm sorry you're struggling so much. Alcoholism is so heartbreaking and it's honestly ruined some of my life in the past. I hope he can figure it out and stop being toxic in that way for you. I hope your interview goes well.

bipolar,fdh7db3,t3_elbjna,1578416971.0,"(More of a vent than advice, but I relate way too much to this post and these feelings)
A friend of mine and I recently had this conversation. She has bipolar disorder too, so we are able to understand eachother better than anyone else. We were talking about how friendships have been hard (both in our early 20s) and it sucks because we live in different states. It's like either we sabotage the relationships or the friends do something to screw things up. We make friends and don't feel hopeful that these people will stay in our lives. In fact, she's the only friend I have that I KNOW will be there until the end. 

We make irrational choices and are too impulsive or we get depressed and push people away. I think my main thing though, is when I am depressed, I feel like a zombie. I can't seem to maintain conversations (I also have ADHD) because I either can't focus, or I'm just so boring to talk to. I become monotone. I honestly wish I could get better, but man, bipolar disorder sometimes feels like what I could imagine hell being like. I hope all of us who struggle with maintaining friendships are able to overcome that better and find ways to prevent from sabotaging future relationships. I just want friends to grow old with who will play Mario kart and kick my ass while doing so lol"

I love hearing him get stoked about new projects or things that he learned. He's the person I want to spend most of my time with because I genuinely enjoy his company.

I think maybe your girlfriend used the word exciting and maybe she was more meaning spontaneous? Definitely talk to her about it. I'm sure it was not meant to be a bad thing. I'd hope that if my boyfriend overheard such a conversation, he'd take it well or talk to me about it if it upset him."

I do have to say though, I know I am a difficult person to be with at times. Though my boyfriend and I have developed a very happy and healthy relationship.
