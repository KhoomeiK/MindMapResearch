worldnews,ff952tq,t1_ff91j76,1579705035.0,That is interesting. We have two apple varieties (an heirloom and a Braeburn) and a crab apple for pollination. I never would have thought that planting a seed wouldn't be effective.
worldnews,ff90d3t,t1_ff8y7bp,1579701611.0,"Adding heirloom varieties, there have to be a hundred varieties. In the states, I use [this](https://www.rareseeds.com/store/vegetables/tomatoes) site and it has 11+ categories, let alone how many varieties. Commercially available apples are definitely not as diverse probably due to how long it takes to cultivate but are up there depending where you look."

worldnews,fdg20k3,t1_fdfz3ni,1578377097.0,"Well Wikipedia (for what it's worth) would disagree with that: ""Locusts are a collection of certain species of short-horned grasshoppers in the family Acrididae that have a swarming phase. These insects are usually solitary, but under certain circumstances they become more abundant and change their behaviour and habits, becoming gregarious. No taxonomic distinction is made between locust and grasshopper species; the basis for the definition is whether a species forms swarms under intermittently suitable conditions. "" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locust?wprov=sfti1

But yea, semantics. In any case, you can eat them and a local event has fried grasshoppers in a taco that I will probably try at some point."
