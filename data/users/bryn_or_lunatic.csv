Old_Recipes,ffat98r,t3_es5nxl,1579743961.0,stirring passages sounds like a cookbook to keep you regular
Old_Recipes,fevtkws,t3_eqlnjq,1579401321.0,Super cool!
GifRecipes,fe8b4kk,t1_fe849wm,1578924372.0,It’s pleasant. I use it to make chocolate sauce if I don’t have cream and now I prefer it. Slightly cheesecakey flavour.
aww,fe6dql8,t1_fe62f4r,1578887913.0,You are correct. I’ll edit. My friends’ Airedale seemed so big.
aww,fe5vzxo,t1_fe5vbxy,1578876188.0,I was thinking it may be an Irish terrier but it definitely has a black saddle.
aww,fe5s9rz,t1_fe5q7qq,1578873837.0,"That dog is a welsh terrier. no way is it 40 lbs of a wheaten let alone an 50lb* Airedale.
Edit: originally said much higher weight."

FoodPorn,fe3r0fl,t3_enot28,1578852041.0,It sounds interesting. I’d probably add apples and dried cranberries like I do for my curried chicken salad(coronation chicken) and Sub out some of the mayo for Greek yogurt.
grilling,fdwrhmr,t3_en8dvv,1578761637.0,What about pounding it flat and doing a rouladen? A roll up with maybe provolone and a salami? Or sautéed mushrooms and onions?
beer,fdwq3ur,t1_fdvwuji,1578761302.0,Agreed. Cans can get smelly and dusty and take up wayyyy too much space.
beer,fdvwb01,t3_en7h6b,1578752379.0,"I have a huge apothecary jar full of them, most unique. I think I’ll do a bar top one day with them. Collecting has slowed down as most Alberta/B.C. brewers are using cans these days."
VictorianEra,fdmal7i,t3_em4a1p,1578544001.0,If the hats were felt or another animal fur it probably helped keep the hats from drying out and becoming brittle. Conditioning furs with oils can help preserve them.
VintageMenus,fdgw49h,t3_el2sxm,1578409790.0,Essence of tomato... do you think that is a tomato consommé?
alberta,fdgno0w,t3_el58fw,1578403324.0,Where’s the picture of the field of tiger lilies when you enter?  Are they still there?
specializedtools,fdgml1d,t1_fdghrhc,1578402358.0,Also having the strands of wool all parallel or in line will make a finer thread/yarn (diameter) when spinning and I believe a stronger one.
aww,fd2tjxe,t1_fd2skmb,1578151500.0,The Canadian prairies region produces very hard wheat flour (high in gluten) and it is sought after in many cases.
quilting,fcwfiif,t1_fcw14g1,1578024301.0,Yes! Wonderful eye for colour.
VintageMenus,fcm5dt0,t3_ehp6zc,1577764673.0,What was up with olives and celery as applies? Celery doesn’t seem to cellar particularly well.
quilting,fbk6csr,t1_fbjzs3f,1576945443.0,Use painted tape as a guide. It makes it easier and since it comes in different widths you have that flexibility and you just reposition it for each new line
