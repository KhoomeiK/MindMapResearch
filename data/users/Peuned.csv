mildlyinteresting,femaeed,t1_fem6mnc,1579245876.0,"mashing plain potatoes is cheap.  but to make some nice ones, i need some butter, some cream, garlic and / or other herbs.

timewise, if you have a casserole, a roast, some steaks, two more sides and a salad, the time and counter space used for the whole process can be non tiny.

using from scratch basics, with idahoan potatoes actually comes out pretty good imo.  if you already have it it's no biggie.  but nobody comes over for the mashed potatoes.  the smoked game are usually a hit, with the scallop alfredo pasta, etc being appreciated more."

if i remember correctly the prison heist, you hijack a prison bus with escort, infiltrate and shoot your way out of a prison undermanned, escape through a shootout, and theres a guy flying a plane that has to evade a bunch of death threats while flying....lots of places for multiple ppl to fail,...but when it goes right, it's great. finally"
