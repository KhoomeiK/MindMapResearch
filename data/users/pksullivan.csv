Cooking,fee6poc,t3_eomapi,1579027531.0,"A taco is a tortilla folded around well seasoned meat or vegetables and toppings, generally including a salsa. 

The Mexican tortilla is different from the Spanish tortilla. It's a flatbread made with corn or flour, rather than a potato omelette. If you want to make your own, I recommend making a flour tortilla, as corn tortillas require significantly more work and specialized steps/ingredients. A flour tortilla should be the same thickness and generally the same texture as lefse, if you've had that.

Brown your mince as you would for cottage pie, be sure to break it into small pieces. If you're adding water to create a sauce around your mince you'll want it drier than cottage pie. It should be tacky when finished but not dripping wet. 

For toppings, I personally am a big fan of simplicity. Minced red onion, chopped cilantro, and a squeeze of lime are all I need on many tacos. Other toppings can include cheese (shredded cheddar for Tex-Mex style, cotija or queso fresco for something a little more authentic), lettuce, tomato, jalapeño, and salsa. Salsa is a sauce typically made using chilies as a base. The simplest to make at home is probably *pico de gallo.* A simple pico de gallo would be tomatoes, onion, jalapeño, peppers, cilantro, salt, and lime.

Cooking,febhlil,t3_eobwns,1578958850.0,"I'd make a big patty out of it and plop it down. Lou's does a sausage disc on their deep dish. 

The biggest challenge would probably be getting a consistent thickness while maintaining shape. Do you do your deep dish in a skillet? Maybe make your meatball mix, spray the inside of the skillet well with cooking spray (or brush with olive oil) and form the patty in there. That would give you the right shape for it and if you can find a way to press it down, you could get an even thickness. Then flip it out onto parchment or a cutting board and stick it in the fridge until it's time to drop it on the pie. Might have to trim the edge of the patty, though, since it would form to the size of the skillet *before* you put your crust in."
Cooking,feb9hrx,t3_eo6e41,1578956590.0,"Love my Instant Pot. I've got a 6 quart. It gets used to speed up dishes that normally take a long time to cook, like Indian food and jambalaya. Pressure cooking risotto takes almost the same amount of time, since it needs to come up to temp, but it's not time I have to spend actively stirring so it's definitely easier even if it's not faster. My wife makes yogurt with it. We've also done a bunch of slow cooking with it; I make a pretty great marinara sauce that way. Using the pressure cook function to make turkey stock after Thanksgiving is just absolutely awesome. It's almost turkey Jell-O and packed with flavor.

We got rid of our rice cooker and a janky old crock pot that kept boiling everything when we got the Instant Pot. It freed up space in our cabinets and has been a great tool. In the end, though, it's just a tool. It won't make you a better cook. But if you know to use it, you can get great results from it that are faster or more efficient that other methods."

Jedi Master \[forget name\] rushes to Mandalore to break the Separatist defenses. With him ride the 99th Clone Battalion."" The Jedi master was giving the mission briefing in the LAAT/I as they made planetfall. Their ship gets hit by anti-aircraft.
