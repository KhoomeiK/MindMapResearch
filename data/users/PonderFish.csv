politics,feih69o,t1_feicir9,1579138438.0,"I think you are selling Sanders record short. He managed to pass the VA bill with almost unanimous margins in the Senate and the House for example. 

The backlash isn’t contained to Sanders supporters, you have people that have donated and campaigned for Warren who are upset by this attack, who are now leaving her campaign. Supporters aren’t politicians and they are going to be raw. Historically this isn’t anything new. I think there is also a bit of a rejection of using a phrase about believing rape victims to believing a women trying to paint a political ally as a sexist. The thing here is, Warren is a progressive. No doubt. But she is as she put it a capitalist. Progressives are radicalizing and slowly becoming leftists. This is why Warren is struggling with her left flank. Some were fine with Warren as a second choice because of her record, despite some moving to the center, but her trying to say Sanders is sexist, rather than trying to stand on her own policies or draw difference, or focus on wearing down Biden rather than going after Sanders. That wasn’t what a progressive ally does.


I also question “with nothing to back it up” the ultimate source of this is Warren. She said at some point, that Sanders said something sexist. To a staffer, to a CNN reporter. Doesn’t matter. If this did occur, why has she been buddy buddy with Sanders since? Why did she not call him out on this immediately? This seems and feels like an invention. It is very similar to the smears that HRC pushed in 2016. Warren claims it happens in the vaguest way possible and then says she doesn’t want anymore questions about it. I invite you to tell me why Sanders would say a women can’t be president when he has consistently advocated women get involved in politics, and asked Warren to run in 2015. Furthermore the timing her is suspect Warren is potentially not going to qualify for the 15% delegate precinct threshold for the Iowa Caucus. 


I also want to challenge this premise that Sanders supporters are a cult. It is possible that maybe what we have here is a group of people who are actually interested in the policies and vision that Sanders has advocated for over 40 years? That the Democratic party has not only ignored, but maligned and sold out. Was Andrew Jackson a leader of a cult? Was FDR?
More recently, was Obama?

Popular politicians aren’t by definition cult leaders. They are popular. And people will defend a politician against baseless attacks and characterizations, who are in their eyes are their only decent shot at a better life.

I will also respond to what you claim is a weakness. Being one person from a small state in a legislative body of 99 other people is a lot different than being the top of a ticket, giving people a vision to go out and vote and crush Republicans down ticket everywhere. You win elections as a democrat by inspiring people and turning non-voters into voters. You give them something to fight for that effects their day to day problems. How is Biden going to enlarge and excite the base? How is any candidate fielding half measures of semi progressive ideas going to win against Trump, is going to combat the growing number and ferocity of the alt right?  

I think looking at who owns various media companies and who is writing what articles is telling. I am a historian, we are trained to looks at sources and evaluate data, evidence, and arguments. A huge part of that is looking at who has an ax to grind, and might try to slant the data and ignore certain  things. There people who don’t like Sanders who are in respected positions of power to create a narrative that overlooks positives and seeks to build and make a bigger deal of possible negative stuff.

While their positions seem close, at the heart of it is how each at times what degree they embrace capitalism. Which informs how hard each will fight for every day bread and butter worker issues. I am aware that Sanders is not the socialist that Debs was for example, but with as much window pushing as there has been over the last 90 years, it is honestly refreshing still to have a politician attack the root of suffering most of us endure. While Warren just thinks capitalism needs some tinkering, some fixes, a patch update. That is morally moving in the right direction, but it still enables, and perhaps perpetuates the exploitation of 99.9% of the population. 

But that is just me being some form of socialist of one kind or another for all my adult life, backing another kind of socialist. Ideologically he is closer to me, he supports things like co-ops and uses the same lens as I do to view the world. Warren does not.

Getting non-voters engaged is how this happens, trying to please centrists and play the 90’s triangulation game isn’t a winning strategy anymore. It might, depending, be for the presidency, but your down ticket will still suffer. You got almost half the voting population sitting out. Why is that? Democrats have to do a better job of addressing class concerns, and teach as they lead. 


I don’t doubt that Warren would make a capable president should she manage a win. But what happens after her presidency? Obama managed a significant win. And then we ended up with Trump. His movement built around him fell apart almost as soon as it got him elected. Even as Sanders lost, the movement he built remained and worked hard on getting progressives elected and pushing the party forward and to the left. I think that speaks to something with legs."
DemocraticSocialism,fea77wv,t1_fe9of40,1578945165.0,"That is an interesting generalization, what do you think about the counter argument that women leaders might feel forced to act more “aggressive” as to not appear weak or incapable of making the “tough” calls. There was some talk of HRC coming off as a war hawk because she was a women, mostly heard as an excuse for her Iraq war vote."

politics,fe8wt86,t1_fe8ua2l,1578931940.0,"So this is where it gets muddy. The media took what HRC said and ran headlines calling him unqualified and attributing it to her. They didn’t correct the headline or quotes until after Sanders fired back.


Again. This sort of attack back in forth pales in comparison to what happened between Obama and HRC in 2008 and just a redic nothingness compared to the RNC convention in 2016. We have to keep in mind that the media is interested in generating clicks and views and such. Creating a narrative of contention and keeping people engaged by shocking new chapter is what they get paid to do. It is a not a small part of why we have ended up with Trump."
politics,fe0eqsc,t1_fe079vb,1578812076.0,"I mean in 2016, he was talking about running against Sanders as a spoiler for Trump. So it is kinda a surprise that he isn’t threatening another 3rd party run."

Her being a Republican early on isn’t going to play well with voter turnout once it is blared on every tv, radio, and net ad."
politics,fdl4wn5,t1_fdkyoa9,1578517095.0,"Honestly her base isn’t all that progressive, or maybe leftist would be better in this case? She is holding a bunch of 2nd choice Biden and Buttigieg voters. She is helping Sanders more so than not currently, the more moderate she becomes the more helpful she will likely be for Sanders campaign calculations. I wonder how much this will be reflected in her delegates at the convention, should they become unbound in a 2nd vote."

It should also help weaken US-Iraq relations further.

HRC was still in a winnable situation, made more difficult by Republicans and Russians, which is a problem that needs to be fixed, no argument. However if you honestly believe that there is no chance, that HRC was never going to win because of Russians and Republicans, why are we even talking about primaries. We should be talking about something more drastic, general strikes, nationwide protests, ect."

I wish you the best on your journey."

politics,fcuh3ra,t1_fcueirw,1577980813.0,"I think it is a reflection that most candidates of color tend to be more moderate, either because personal inclination or because the districts they serve/served. The DNC also has had a custom of campaigning against more progressive dems and actively trying to tear them down. 

That moderation doesn’t play well nationally it seems because there is an expectation because they are a poc that they actually are progressive, so that turns off moderates, who will write them off largely. Then the progressives will listen to them talk, and then they will realize they are actually moderates. So they have a hard time actually reaching their ideological base. So When you have someone like Joe in the race, who is a throwback to a different era of party politics, and has some positive Obama rep around him, and above all name recognition, it just murders poc campaigns."
