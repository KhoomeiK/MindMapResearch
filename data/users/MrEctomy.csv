The first part of this sentence is false, obviously. The second part however, is true.

You don't really know the true nature of people until they've been exposed or vulnerable. You only know the image that they put forth. 

He has not ""always been an honest person"". He's honest when he wants to be, and dishonest when he wants to be. That means he's dishonest.

Yes, he is a completely different person than he wants you to believe he is. It's a sad thing to realize, but a lot of people put on an act, they wear masks, they act a certain way and they want you to *re*act a certain way.

You can ""improve mechanics"" via patching, same with adding new characters.

truegaming,fgf839k,t3_exuvwz,1580729397.0,">Ultimate is only a year old and new content has been announced for the next two years so I understand it is VERY early to discuss the future of the series

Right off the bat I gotta hugely disagree with you right here. We're talking about a series with 5 iterations that has been going for over 20 years now. If anything, it's time to talk about where the end is. In fact I think they called Smash Ultimate ""Ultimate"" because it's implying that this is the ultimate realization of the game, and that this is sort of the end of the road when it comes to refining the core ""formula"" of the game.

I'm actually really curious as to why you would say it's ""very early"" to discuss the future of a 20 year old franchise. Can you explain why you say that?

I actually assumed that this would be the last smash game. You can't do much better than 74 playable characters and a highly refined system of core mechanics.

Why would you make yet another Smash Bros game at this point? Even if they wanted to, it would basically just be Smash Ultimate, wouldn't it? I mean I get that they *could* make a new game in the way that Madden or FIFA do, but I imagine all but the most rabid fanboys would just continue playing Smash Ultimate instead.

At this point the system is pretty much as refined as it's going to be. All they can really do is more characters, more stages, more modes, etc.

I guess they can keep milking the cash cow they've created but as far as creativity in the Smash Bros universe, I think it's all gone.

If they changed the game in a major way that would warrant a new release, I'm afraid that might alienate more fans than it appeases. Still, *to this day,* there are people who only play Smash Bros Melee, even though it came out 20 years ago and is lacking a lot of what makes modern Smash Bros enjoyable.

At the end of the day this is all Smash fans really want. We just want a good, balanced core combat system with a large selection of characters. You change the game too much, you overhaul a lot of characters  in a major way that doesn't improve them, and you're going to alienate a lot of players who main those fighters. Moreover, any of the changes you mention to change existing characters could just be patched in, as they have been doing.

Simply put, there's no reason to continue making smash games at this point aside from exploiting the fanbase financially, and I think people are going to have a major problem with that."

Is the idea that musically can be objectively good ridiculous? No? Then why not the opposite?

How many songs and music videos can you think of which were *so bad* that they become hugely popular because of how bad they are?

But even putting that aside. Certain kinds of music are much easier to make and simpler to compose than others, right?

Like the song I used in this post...it's literally just an 8 second loop played over and over throughout the entire song.

Let's say I take an 8 second sample and play it on loop for 2 and a half minutes. That would take me approximately 5 minutes to do. That's most of my song right there.

Now I just need to record myself speaking in a monotone voice, in a simple rhythmic manner with unimaginative lyrics about being wealthy and disrespecting women.

So really this song just has two parts

An 8-second sample played on repeat for as long as you need AND a vocal track of myself saying words in a monotone voice.
