SoftwareEngineering,ffrmgt2,t1_ffrlrca,1580161087.0,"Ok cool. One warning to hopefully save you some time:

You'll be tempted to alter the underlying CMS code in Django. Feel free to go ahead and do this for the purposes of learning, but every CMS has a solution engineered which allows the main code to be updated without breaking third-party 'plugins' - e.g. any plugin you may code.

Django uses 'hooks' but I can't see 'filters' so I'm not sure how they handle that part of functionality. See, I'm using my transferrable knowledge from the WordPress CMS world.

A hook is like an event. In Django's main code there will be multiple hooks on every page. For example, there will be a hook for 'start drawing footer' and 'finish drawing footer' and you can add code to these 'hooks'. That code will be run whenever the hook is run. In this way, your code and Django's code can remain separate and be updated separately without interfering with each other.

Have fun!"
SoftwareEngineering,ffrle4g,t1_ffrjua3,1580160434.0,"You're already half-assing the learning procedure by holding back on learning in case you 'learn the wrong thing'.

You said you were a geek since age 8. I started coding at 6 in C64 basic. Before I was at university I'd learned C64 Basic, AMOS basic, a little C and a little assembly language.

Before uni, I'd written dozens of complete games, a flat-file database program, a task reminder, an alarm clock, a dungeons & dragons character creator and more - way more.

You're either into it or you're not. If you're into it, stop holding back and get building stuff now.

If you're stuck for what to code, why not start with coding a simple game? Download the Unreal Engine 4 and play with that. Almost everything you learn in software engineering gives you transferable skills."

There are specialisations at each of these areas.

It depends what you want. Learning another programming language will never do you any harm, but if I were you I'd be working on building some applications using python or some apps or something. There's plenty you could get started on now in your own time."

* The keto diet kickstarts the autophagy effect - also available through intermittent fasting - this is the body's self-repair system and your body will unfold misfolded proteins and fix other stuff
* The keto diet reduces inflammation in a big way - the biggest inflammatories are mostly carbs, so it makes sense that keto would reduce inflammation. Reducing inflammation fixes a LOT of things, but keto is not the only way.
* There's an estimate that 50% of cancers only feed on glycogen. Glycogen comes from carbs, so if you eliminate carbs you eliminate the food source for half of cancers. 

None of the above has had proper scientific studies on humans done - I'm pretty sure the only proper scientific study was in connection with keto curing epilepsy.

Of the above 3 things, 2 of them are achievable with IF instead of keto. The 3rd one, the cancer one, has some promising results in rat studies but nothing useful in humans.

As it stands, this friend of OP is on a path to losing all her good friends and ending up with other ego-driven and materialistic friends who will ditch her as soon as she splits with her rich husband, if he ends up rich in future which is quite likely with ego-driven, materialistic narcissists.

So if OP's friend right now is really delusionally thinking that OP is out to get her and being nasty, then when her new friends abandon her later she's gonna become a bitter old woman.

The other companies are siphoning the money to other countries through dodgy means - e.g. they will have a department of their company or a sister company based in a lower corporation tax country and then have that part of their company overcharge the places that made profit for services. Quite often this will be accounting services but it could be anything.

The same thing has been going on for ages with other dodgy companies over in Africa, especially the mining companies.

SoftwareEngineering,fedwttq,t1_fedu99k,1579021565.0,"Just to be clear, I distinguish between contractors and consultants. A contractor works for himself and goes on short contracts to various companies. For software engineering as a contractor you'll get paid anything between £20 and £100 per hour.

Consultants, on the other hand, work for companies and have the resources of that company at their disposal, so typically the rate they charge to the hiring company will be double what a contract would get. e.g. IBM and Unisys hire out their consultants to large corporations and government organisations at well over £1000 per day.

A consultant/contractors rate is going to depend on location, sector, skills and how big of a problem the hiring company have.

If you do run-of-the-mill software engineering stuff that any old software engineer can do then you are guaranteeing yourself that you will be able to find work but that you won't be well paid.

If you adjust your risk/reward ratio slightly by specialising in something more niche and more closely tied to revenue or profits then you can earn way more at the risk of sometimes being jobless."

Very little stress, no need to get involved in office politics and if you're struggling to get out of bed as a contractor you can quickly calculate how much your lie-in is going to cost you.

I contracted for about 10 years or so. I found it easy to find contracts to be honest, but then I'm incredibly flexible in terms of where I'll move to. I love travelling so I had contracts in Glasgow, London, Northampton, Australia, France and more.

Other than being flexible, being immediately available is also often very helpful. When I got my first contract, I was in a permanent job and every agent I spoke to said they needed someone sooner - I was ideal, but they needed me to start inside 2 weeks.

So I handed in my notice and then by the time 2 weeks of my notice period were left I got 2 contract offers. I took the one in my favoured city.

I quit my first job a year out of university - they had a pay-for-performance system. 13 graduates in my intake and we all started on £21,000. After year 1 it was obvious who was great in the team and who was crap. I was one of the 2 best and this other guy was definitely the worst.

I got my pay for performance pay rise up to £22,500 whilst this other crap guy went up to £22,000. I'd been consulted out for over 100 days at £800 per day on behalf of the company, and he had never been consulted out - not once. So I'd earned the company, just through consultancy, £80,000 and they gave me a salary raise of £500 more than the crap guy.

So I told them then handed in my notice so I could go contracting. They sent up 3 directors to try and convince me to change my mind - they offered me £26,000 and then when the 3 directors came up they offered me £35,000 which was a very decent offer and if the original salary increase had been anywhere near that I wouldn't have left.

AmItheAsshole,fedfw2g,t1_fedczhn,1579010417.0,"> Investment does not always means money you can get later. 

I was going to reply ""Yes it does"" and then provide a bunch of links to dictionaries showing how you're wrong.

Turns out, in American English (not in the Finance world) the word investment has morphed to mean you can invest for a future non-monetary benefit.

Anyway, here's my links:

> An investment is an asset or item acquired with the goal of generating income or appreciation. In an economic sense, an investment is the purchase of goods that are not consumed today but are used in the future to create wealth.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment.asp

> the investing of money or capital in order to gain profitable returns, as interest, income, or appreciation in value.

https://www.dictionary.com/browse/investment

> the outlay of money usually for income or profit : capital outlay
also : the sum invested or the property purchased

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/investment

The above one has the caveat of 'usually' which surprised me.

Then there's Cambridge which kind of agrees with you:

> the act of putting money, effort, time, etc. into something to make a profit or get an advantage, or the money, effort, time, etc. used to do this:

https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/investment

But the Collins dictionary probably has it best. It lists 3 definitions for 'investment' - an uncountable noun, a variable noun and a countable noun. The 'countable' noun definition agrees with you so I'm going to stop now:

> UNCOUNTABLE NOUN
> Investment is the activity of investing money.
> He said the government must introduce tax incentives to encourage investment.
> One of the most important changes concerns the investment of pension contributions.
> 
> VARIABLE NOUN
> An investment is an amount of money that you invest, or the thing that you invest it in.
> ...an investment of twenty-eight million pounds.
> You'll be able to earn an average rate of return of 8% on your investments.
> ...people's desire to buy a house as an investment.
> Total foreign investment in America still constitutes only about 5% of U.S. assets.
> 
> COUNTABLE NOUN [usually singular, usually adjective NOUN]
> If you describe something you buy as an investment, you mean that it will be useful, especially because it will help you to do a task more cheaply or efficiently.
> When selecting boots, fine, quality leather will be a wise investment.
> Theatre membership can be a good investment.

I would never call boots a wise investment - they may be a wise purchase, but I'm not getting a return. Anyway, it seems I don't know everything."
AmItheAsshole,fedeupi,t1_feddbb2,1579009585.0,"That's not how ROI works **at all**. ROI is strictly financial.

You can have surplus benefits etc, but return on investment is a percentage monetary figure."
AmItheAsshole,fedeka3,t1_feddj6u,1579009352.0,"Ok, but a 'depreciating asset' is being purchased, not an investment. A car purchase is similar to a washing machine purchase, both are depreciating assets, neither are investments. You want it to work and do the job for a certain amount of time and then you'll get back a fraction of what you paid for it when you sell it, or you might just scrap it.

The definition of investment is literally paying money to then get that money back later + some profit. Of course you can have bad investments that lose money, but that's where the risk/reward comes into play.

But a car is almost *never* an investment.

I'm not the only one who thinks this:

> a car should only be considered an investment if it's a collectible classic

https://auto.howstuffworks.com/buying-selling/is-car-really-investment.htm

> Although your car is an expensive purchase, this does not mean it is an investment. Many people consider a car an investment because of the large price tag. When you spend a large amount of money, you may assume that you will receive a return on the money that you put into the it. The rule of thumb is: investments make you money. Where a home appreciates in value over time and stocks pay a dividend and appreciate in value, a car depreciates over time and is worth less money each year.

https://www.thebalance.com/is-buying-a-car-an-investment-2386148

> An automobile is a depreciating asset. As it ages, it loses value rapidly and drastically. There is very little chance of an automobile used for personal transportation will appreciate in value.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/investopedia/2011/02/11/buying-a-car-the-worst-investment/#1a02665d6be4

I think it's dangerous to call it an investment. With an investment, the more you pay, the more you'll earn. That's the *opposite* case with a car. The more you pay, the more you'll lose. 25 years of driving, I've never paid more than £3000 for a car - they typically use £500 per year of work for 3 years or whatever, then I'll sell them for £1000. That means my cars, on average, cost me £3000 - £1000 + (£500 * 3) = £3500 every 3 years, or £1200 per year. If you go buy a £30,000 car, you'll lose £6,000 minimum in just the first year. So, a car is actually the *opposite* of an investment. Hence, it's called a depreciating asset."

Women being protected by judges and avoiding custodial sentences that men would be convicted for is very similar to how the SIL in this thread is probably still in that family - didn't lose a husband, didn't lose a job, didn't lose a house. She's as bad as the man in this case - both of them cheated - but the man was punished. (I'm guessing at this as there's no info on what happened to SIL, but this is likely the case)
