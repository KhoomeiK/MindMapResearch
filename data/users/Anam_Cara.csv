tipofmytongue,ff5742e,t1_ff4x2w4,1579582143.0,Super glue is a really bad idea for deep cuts requiring stitches. They tend to open back up and leave pointy dried shards of glue inside the open wound which is absolutely agonizing.

Assistance,ff29pgq,t1_ff28oo3,1579497975.0,No problem. Anytime. If the other cats are in contact with Cheddar or the box you probably want to treat them just in case. They shouldn't require a vet visit and even from the vet the meds are pretty cheap. It's usually one dose every 2 weeks x 3 doses.
Assistance,ff28for,t1_ff27qdp,1579496839.0,"If they have a fat or round looking belly that's a big indicator of worms which will take a kitten down fast if they have a large infestation. That's why I asked about the deworming because most kittens of feral moms are born with them because the mother has them. 

The honest truth is that it could have been anything. 

Make sure to keep fresh/clean water available for Cheddar and I would still be mixing a little formula into his food for extra hydration and calories, especially if you have concerns or if he starts acting strange at all like his sister was doing. 

Also, don't let him share a litter box with other cats or let other animals come into contact with the litter until you can get the praziquantel... just to be safe."
Assistance,ff27e0j,t1_ff26vf7,1579495935.0,"Typically 6 weeks you can START weaning but it's a slow process of mixing a tiny bit of food to formula and slowly replacing it with more food and less formula, (and basically replacing it almost constantly as it sours after a short period of time) along with a constant supply of fresh water. With orphans I usually continue bottles for at least an extra week or two just to give them an extra boost. It's a learning process for sure. I've been doing rescue for something like 15 years, I pet sit for a living, and I'm working towards my doctorate in vet medicine, (and I still learn something new every day, so don't be too hard on yourself if things don't go perfectly- most people don't even *try*!) I would be happy to be available for you any time you need advice, have questions, concerns, anything. :)"

Assistance,ff260cj,t3_eqxwkr,1579494780.0,"I'm very sorry for your loss.

I know this doesn't help now, but since this is the second kitten in the litter it might be useful to know... if a cat is going into shock like that, rubbing karo syrup (corn syrup) on their gums can often bring them out of it long enough to get them hydrated and get them the help they need. 

If the kittens have not been dewormed yet,that should be done asap. You can get praziquantel liquid wormer online from Walmart.
