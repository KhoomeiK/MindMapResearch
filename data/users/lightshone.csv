Often I might be too tired to remember everything or go into great detail, so when I journal at night, the next entry typically fills in some of the blanks before moving on. 

It makes for an interesting contrast between entries depending on when I’ve written them- since I’ll often jot down a line or two when I’ve the time as well, sporadically in the mornings and such."
