todayilearned,ffv8le4,t1_ffv6jm0,1580258263.0,"So far the things that make it ""obvious"" is a bunch of redditors going ""because I said so"". I wouldn't put it past American politicians to pull something like that, but just because it sounds like it could be true, and just because you want it to be true, doesn't mean it is. Stop being assmad."

dataisbeautiful,fftfvz3,t3_ev42ot,1580219379.0,How reliable is the information coming out of China on this? I've heard local governments are undermining the federal one. Wouldn't surprise me if they're hiding numbers.
