I study as there's just sooo much I don't know yet, and improv is not my greatest strength. I bet you're doing great :)"
DMAcademy,ffdmyx5,t3_et1e97,1579824321.0,"I am all for taking notes, so that way I'm prepared to answer questions about past sessions, like what loot did we get from this encounter, or at least if the party is stuck I can prod them in the right way with reminders/questions of things they'd already know. I use OneNote, each session has two folders, session prep and in/after session notes."

I always think about grabbing snack food but then I have to wait to speak with every bite I take, so food and drink is often forgotten for me. Until the party starts debating heavily what to do, then I've got 5 free minutes for chips."

I don't mind it, I'm more grateful we get to host so we don't have to figure out who can baby sit on a late Sunday evening."
TrueOffMyChest,ff1j7n3,t3_er3v9e,1579480064.0,"When I told my parents, mom replied you're just confused you have to pick a side, dad felt I just wanted attention. Years later, getting married, mom says guess you finally chose a side. Instantly irked me, replied no I chose the PERSON I want to spend the rest of my life with, that doesn't negate me being bi. She hasn't bought it up again, dad seems to have accepted it but we don't talk about it. Think they feel under the rug is better. 

Your parents are choosing to not understand your sexual standing. Right now I'm assuming you live with them and so have to deal with them on a constant basis. When you can get out, and have your own safe place, maybe they'll realize if they keep it up they'll push you away and lose you until they realize their actions"
NoStupidQuestions,fewketl,t1_few9x6f,1579412586.0,"If you are still asking about the one lost at sea or through other means, then it's more difficult but still doable depending on who you make deals with. Really the overall answer is yes, but there's so many what ifs to the equation that it's not a clear cut ""what happens next"" for each situation"

What really dictates how that plays out is how well the current leader is doing, how the people and/or nobles feel, whether or not the one returning can gain enough popularity and backing to even stand a chance at claiming their spot either through force or political maneuvering."

sex,feqgg3g,t3_eq9yi0,1579341576.0,"IUDs: Long term and once in you're good to go for a long while. However if your lady parts are easily irritated then this might not work out well. Also they can be caught or have effects to having something foreign in your body for a lengthy period of time.

Depo shot: Long term effect for one shot, but side effects can be more serious. Weight gain is a popular side effect, and how well your body distributes the drug over time depends on each person. Can't remember off the top of my head, but I think one shot lasts 3 years. 

Birth control pills: Have to take it orally every night, and at the same time give or take an hour. If you're forgetful this can be annoying but alarms help. Also have side effects, weight gain, mood swings, BUT fairly easy to stop and your body swings back to normal levels relatively quickly. Great common side effect is it helps lessen blood flow during periods.

***Mini pill is relatively the same, but less effective (what you use when nursing)

Patch: I don't recall much about this one, but I feel it's a mix between the depo shot and the IUDs, also now you've a patch on you at all times. How annoying that is depends on you.

Condoms: Only one that also helps protect against STDs, if used correctly is a useful contraception. However many people feel it gets in the way of sex, one having to stop fun time to put it on, and two men tend to complain that they don't feel as much. 

Every contraceptive has side effects, pros and cons, one choice is not best for all. It's always good to talk to your doctor, do some research, to see what you feel is best for you. Personally I've liked the pill form due to having murder falls every month, so that heavily decreasing was wonderful. I don't feel it's imped my ability to have kids, I've two kids within 15 months of each other. I could continue explaining why the other choices don't feel as comfortable to me, but really it's whatever you feel works best for you."
