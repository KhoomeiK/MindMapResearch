I remember there was a white British student in my school and the whole class loved her accent so much they would ask the teacher to let her read more passages during class. On the other hand if the Indian teacher or Vietnamese teacher mispronounced even a SINGLE word people would snicker and mock them in the class.

I guess some men in high school joked they would never date anyone as black as me and another one in a hookup called me exotic and interesting. I didn’t really care cause the sex was too good."
TheGlowUp,fekq2qp,t1_fejqunf,1579205259.0,Hot take: I’d be careful about this not everyone has the brow structure to have the arch eyebrows or curved eyebrows.

I wouldn’t really call this cheating but they should call these stamps not tattoos. I stand by my opinion don’t really care if it’s gatekeeping.

I would agree that this ability is even more important than anything else in some way. I go to a fairly well known reputable college and my grades were okay but the complete lack of social skills wrecked me in every department from career to romance. I work part time while going to school and even in that blue collar sector I am mocked and roasted for not having any social skills.
