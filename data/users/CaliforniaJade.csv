AmItheAsshole,ffjwjou,t3_eu18sq,1580008898.0,YTA  I think you should back off in asking for the extra $300 and apologize if you're interested in staying in a relationship with this woman.  You're giving her a lot of reasons to resent you.

AmItheAsshole,ffju38i,t1_ffjtq88,1580006971.0,It's such an unhealthy trait for your mom to reinforce.  It's teaching her that it's fun in a sick way to manipulate people.  Can you record her gloating and show it to your mom?  Or does you mom know?
AmItheAsshole,ffjtez7,t3_eu0qti,1580006449.0,"NTA I'm sure your mom is doing the best she can, but too bad your moms rules ended up pitting your sister against you.  One of my childs teachers used to say, unless someones life is in danger, I don't want to hear it.  It sounds like your sisters mission is to spy on you which is only going to make you more covert and less wanting of any type of relationship with her.  It might help to talk to your mom about this (or not)."

I’d try her first during the off times of the park, for me, that’s between 10 and 3.  Another good choice would be early in the morning.  Does she like running after balls?  A chuck-it is a great toy for ball dogs."
