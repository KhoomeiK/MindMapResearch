homeschool,fh3xaag,t3_f121ul,1581273222.0,Depends on your local high school policies.  The high school does need to take you but may start you back at the beginning of 9th and not take any of your high school work for credit.
UWMadison,fgz1vq3,t3_f0g9j0,1581189683.0,"Are you in state?  If not, I would not assume you will be accepted.  

Top 15 public. Great little city. Amenities galore.  Not my kid's first choice during the application process (though we were all trying to keep an open mind).  Very happy with the end result. On Wisconsin!

Assuming you are high stat, keep in mind that there are plenty of high stat highly motivated students at UW Madison.  And absolutely agree that many schools like NE have prioritized rankings over all else."

wisconsin,fgykqc2,t3_f0tyjt,1581184257.0,"La Crosse is nice.  But I think the amenities for someone single in their 20's isn't super awesome.  It is probably similar in feel to Stevens Point with the University there.  But since you wouldn't be attending the University, I think the options there are more limited. 

Are you in a smaller city now? Have you considered a somewhat larger city?  Like Madison, Milwaukee, or (dare I say it) Minneapolis?  All good access to outdoorsy activities, bike friendly, great arts scenes, etc"

AmItheAsshole,fgyeof3,t3_f0pmp1,1581182568.0,YTA .  This would be a good opening to have some discussions with your daughter about socioeconomic levels and how to care for that scarf and when it might be appropriate to wear it.  A few gifts from someone wealthier is not going to ruin a kid.  The appropriate response in 99% of receiving gifts is saying thank you.

Both for job accessibility upon graduation and because I actually think I came out better prepared to be productive than some of my peers.

NTA assuming you held the line on the ""no"" the entire time.  ESH if you led people to believe you would be at the event.

I never had a baby shower.  I never really wanted one or cared.  My first pregnancy was high risk so it felt too stressful.  My SIL wanted to give me one and I said that would be ok AFTER the baby was born.  She then declined.  Whatever.

I would say, people who love you will want to gift you something.  I got 40+ gifts for baby #2 and never had a shower.  I'm sure I got a similar number for baby #1, I just can't remember.  So it can be helpful to register in case people ask even if you don't have an event planned.

I would also say by the time your kid is a toddler, you won't care what your kid wears and you'll wonder why you cared so much about something your kid would use so little.  Both DH and I had plenty of disposable income prior to having kids, but priorities shift.  So I'd just watch the attitude about having the we need the best of everything out in public."

Lindahl does a high volume.  I'm sure most of his houses are listed high to start and it's kind of nuts to list a house for sale right before the holidays.

Please don't assume everyone who was homeschooled was not college ready or fully educated.  I just graduated a kid who could have applied to any college in the US and had 2 years of dual enrollment under his belt before graduation.  Not everyone should go to college.

My dd had longer hair for a while as a preschooler and it was a HUGE relief to put it in a bob for a while.  

Your husband sound controlling and mean.  It would be one thing to be surprised and maybe a little sad because your baby looks suddenly different.  It's another thing refusing to communicate all together.  Especially with such a young child involved. She might think it is her fault.  Poor baby.  I can't imagine why a full grown adult should care that much about a child's hair.  Hair is a PITA.  This type of controlling behavior is really unhealthy and creepy."

Also agree she was making assumptions.  I ran a marathon less than being super thin as many do.  It would be a completely different situation if you had opened a conversation with someone like ""just started working out again this week"".  That would open the door to her saying ""looking good - nice work"".  None of her f-ing business.

AmItheAsshole,ffr8uwt,t3_euspm9,1580152980.0,"NTA.  People should be making things easier for parents of infants, not harder.  They know where you live.  It's your husband's family.  He could walk over there with the baby now and again.  Them being there when grandma babysits is probably fine and baby could probably get used to them pretty quickly.  7-12 months is kind of the  peak of that sort of baby drama.  Baby will start remembering people a bit better in the not so distant future.  

I guarantee great grandma is old school and thinks the mom should do all that social engineering.  And when mom works full time and has an infant, I call BS.   This one is on your husband.
