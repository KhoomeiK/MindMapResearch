fatlogic,ffi4jnl,t3_etr1xy,1579964874.0,“There aren’t enough of you to have calories on menus”? The entirety of the loseit subreddit would beg to differ.
fatlogic,ffcvkbd,t1_ffcsgyo,1579808158.0,"Yeah, those fat percentages are way off. Those are both in the healthy fat percentage range for each sex, and the “average” person is definitely not in the healthy range!"
fatlogic,ffcvabi,t1_ffbd1vs,1579807991.0,"You are so right. The pushing yourself through your discomfort is really important. When I’m 40 minutes into my 60 minute run, it sucks. But I push through and when I’m done I get an enormous endorphin rush. I feel better for the rest of my day. The idea that you have to have “joy” in your exercise is a lie that prevents people from the true joy that comes with achievement, perseverance, and dedication."
fatlogic,ff67gwk,t1_ff5xuxv,1579620947.0,"Hilariously, where BMI arguably fails is for muscular men. It’s actually very accurate for determining over fat (or under fat) for women."

loseit,fenxvoa,t1_fenwd7g,1579292462.0,"Could it be cooked vs raw? As in, the give you 6oz raw chicken, and then you cook it and it becomes 4oz with all the water getting cooked out?"
fatlogic,fenvgll,t1_fenlvfh,1579291515.0,"What’s the breathing technique?! I’ve been wanting to get back to swimming, but I feel like I get out of breath far too fast and can’t get into a rhythm of breathing right."
fatlogic,fencqeo,t1_fenab2v,1579281888.0,"I don’t mean to be pedantic, but “wherefore” means “for what reason” or basically “why”. So when Juliet said “wherefore art thou Romeo”, she wasn’t asking where he was, but rather why he was called Romeo (i.e., why was he a Montegue)."
loseit,fehogm4,t3_ep2e3g,1579120679.0,"Did you just start working out? A new exercise regimen will cause water retention for up to six weeks after starting out. Your muscles get micro tears from working out, so then they become inflamed, which means they hold on to more water than usual. This can take several weeks to dissipate. Give it time."
