Wellthatsucks,ffc5zc7,t1_ffc2bc1,1579792323.0,"Honestly I don't know if cats can do that but since everyone says it's photoshop, I try to see and confirm it's photoshop. If you look at the cat's right eye (on our left side) the top corner that's kinked down, there's cream white fur, followed by the slightly tan cream colour of the forehead. If you look at the way the ""white cream eyebrows"" flow from left to right, it looks like you drew a line on paper with pencil and accidentally smudged it down - that's characteristic of smudge tool of photoshop. Look at the vertical line from its right ear, going down towards the right eye, and then suddenly the line glitches (zoom it if you need to) 

Secondly, there are parts of the cream white portion that looks repeated (characteristic of Rubber Stamp tool) which feels weird because someone copied a slightly ""cream white"" portion from around the eye and pasted it closer and further around the eyes. The cat looks like batman taking out his face mask after a hard day under the sun, or a the boobs of a girl who had been sun tanning with her bikini top on. 

Also if the cat ""straightened"" its eyes then suddenly there's a bulging white eyebrow that the other eye doesn't have  
     
   
  
But honestly this is after taking a double take. I would have just seen the pic and say hm lmao and then I scrolled off, but then I came back to comments to see if there's anything interesting"

I can see why Africans use tomatoes as extensively as Japanese uses seaweed"

dankmemes,ff8x7yp,t1_ff8woft,1579699037.0,"Sadly the people of the country feel so. We find it ridiculous but its the same with US policymakers and older gens saying video games causes violence. Those who ""are more important"" (ie not youths) feel the need to porn nsfw because it's immoral, wrong. 
  
 Honestly it may just be appeasement/gaining support because that's what majority of the people one, but the gastabo isn't gonna come and break into your house to arrest you for using reddit with VPN (unless you're in aceh, Indonesia where male and female sitting together in public is illegal). Same with many countries and porn, govt being secular or not.


Also I wonder what sensible and moral issue we have today, will become challenged in the future by the youths of tomorrow that will warrant us to take action, at the resentment of the youths"
