OCPoetry,fdpn8xm,t1_fdpfozs,1578633508.0,"Well he was a narcissist, was he not? It's not a crime to write a poem based off a myth. I liked the myth so I did my own twist on it as from view of someone foreshadowing his fate. With the line, ""will be death and your ticket"", most readers can infer I'm talking about the afterlife or whatever else comes after death. You can't just add the word ""thus"" somewhere in my last stanza to try to improve it. The two attempts to change it sound choppy to me, plus I like that one the way it is. Thanks for taking the time to give feedback, though."
OCPoetry,fdosis5,t1_fdooxzy,1578611901.0,"I appreciate the feedback. I didn't consider half of this stuff, let alone know about it. I had to look up what iambic and trochaic lines were. I might've been taught that in high school but I've since long forgot. It was definitely interesting to read your take on it and it's helped me see my own poetry from a more analytical point of view. I appreciate the work you put into helping, thanks!"
OCPoetry,fdonvwp,t1_fdonfr1,1578608989.0,"Hey, I tried to check your poem out but it looks like it got removed by the moderators. Not sure why. I'm new to Reddit too so I'm not sure what to tell you. Just make sure you link two different feedbacks to other peoples poetry when you post. It automatically puts the request feedback thing on for you."
OCPoetry,fdomvt0,t1_fdoltg9,1578608388.0,"Ohh, yeah, that makes sense."
OCPoetry,fdoiz58,t1_fdogp0k,1578606099.0,"You should check the poem out if you didn't already, it's a really good one. Also, keep writing, you definitely have a talent for it. It's not juvenile at all, by the way. I think it sounds very professional. Don't stop writing!"
OCPoetry,fdoejfp,t3_eme3xl,1578603642.0,"I love, love, LOVE this poem! 

The way you rhyme and set your rhythm is 100% the kind of poetry I fall for. The way you speak is also so eloquent and professional, I was pulled in by the first four lines. Opening the poem with the word ""liltingly"" was interesting and is honestly the reason I clicked on the poem. I guess I'm dumb for not knowing what that word meant, so I looked it up. And then I kept reading, and I'm glad I did. One of my favorite poems of all time is ""When We Two Parted"" by Lord Byron and to me, this poem has the same atmosphere. It is refreshing to see such good writing, not saying that everyone else's isn't good, but I really enjoy reading poetry like this. I can tell you put a lot of work into it.  

""There is no place for me it seems,  
And so I sleep; I turn to dreams.  
For in that realm of night I feel,  
Some form of life that I can steal. ""

This stanza hit home for me. I love the way it flows as well. You did an amazing job on this one, keep up the good work!"
OCPoetry,fdochgz,t3_em1whx,1578602664.0,"This poem really got to me, it made me feel a sense of emptiness and dreariness. I love the lines in this poem. The details to help portray a gloomy setting really hit the nail. Like, no one wants to eat cold pizza! It leaves me wondering why the birthday cake went untouched, is he neglected? Depressed? Doesn't like his birthday? I don't know, but I like that you leave it ominous and open to the reader to interpret. The line about his collar being stained crimson by coughs made me sad because the birthday boy is sick and probably dying. It also makes me wonder why he wouldn't take his pills. I think this poem overall was very well written and it definitely conveys emotion without you directly having to say it."
OCPoetry,fdobbrk,t1_fdo6sr8,1578602101.0,Can you elaborate on that? Which lines are you referring to?
OCPoetry,fdnuj53,t1_fdnrp5a,1578593113.0,I appreciate the kind words.
OCPoetry,fdnnhe8,t1_fdmudzd,1578589457.0,"I think I wrote that line just because I liked then sound of it and didn’t consider what exactly they couldn’t have but I guess it’s open to interpretation. It could be love, happiness, or their child (hence why he kills them in the end because he doesn’t want her to have their son if he can’t either). It’s just one of those lines left empty to the readers interpretation. Thanks for the feedback!"
OCPoetry,fdnn1ci,t1_fdn5qne,1578589195.0,"I totally get what you’re saying here. I wrote this when I was 15 so I wasn’t really sure with my wording but I think you have an interesting take on that. It was supposed to mean a shot of something (I was just trying to get it to rhyme) but since in the end he shoots them, I should change the line to foreshadow to his crime. Appreciate the feedback!"
OCPoetry,fdnmoz1,t1_fdna2p1,1578588996.0,I love that a lot! It was definitely one I wrote to make the readers feel something.
OCPoetry,fdnml4h,t1_fdn4bvk,1578588933.0,Appreciate the feedback! I try to keep my poetry focused to it’s theme.
OCPoetry,fdmbmje,t1_fdmbgst,1578544825.0,"Ahaha thank you! I've never spoken my own poetry aloud but I might start doing that, I bet it'd help."
OCPoetry,fdmbew0,t1_fdm9r4d,1578544651.0,"Hey, I'm aware some of the lines don't flow too well so I've been contemplating how to better them yet still get them to have the right rhythm and rhyme. It's not about my father, by the way. I just pulled it from my head like it was a little short story. I appreciate the feedback, thank you!"
OCPoetry,fdm7n7m,t1_fdm1phu,1578541802.0,"Thank you for the feedback, I feel like a lot of us struggle with the fact we all have the same fate of mortality but the fact that we can all connect over it definitely makes it more comforting because even though we all go out alone, we're not really that alone."
Watercolor,fdlslme,t1_fdlkexi,1578531513.0,"You are right, I'm not sure what size paper I used but it's not very big so it was hard to work with what space I had. Feathers are the hardest thing for me to paint but thank you for the advice!"
OCPoetry,fdlpupf,t3_elx10y,1578529637.0,"The 8,5,8,5 syllable stanzas are really good, it sets a good meter and it also helps that you actually rhyme. There are some grammatical errors I would tweak as it makes the reader have to reread certain areas, such as this:

""A rush asleep with eyes unfound 

Serene midnight so deep""

This doesn't flow to the next line very well. My brain is kind of tired so I can't tell if it's because it sounds like a run-on sentence or because it sounds like it should be two difference sentences.

Other than that, I thought you did a really good job. I can definitely see the work you put into this and the imagery really pulls the reader in!"
OCPoetry,fdlp1bk,t1_fdlo1os,1578529083.0,Thank you so much! Really appreciate it.
OCPoetry,fdlomkw,t3_elxoy9,1578528804.0,"This is insanely good. If you wrote a book, I would read it. I love how you opened the poem beginning about such a simple, minuscule object and tied it to the bigger things in life. I love your rhythm and rhyme in this one, too! Keep up the good work. The line about reading the pea a book cracked me up."
OCPoetry,fdlo2tb,t1_fdkooyg,1578528430.0,Appreciate it!
OCPoetry,fdlo1dz,t1_fdkdpuh,1578528402.0,"Hey! I appreciate the feedback, I found it super helpful. Thanks for catching onto the ""whose"" vs. ""who's"" error. I'm usually one to catch a silly mistake like that but I guess it slipped me this time. Definitely taking note of the other advice as well, so once again, thank you!"
poetry_critics,fdk42qa,t3_eliomz,1578495557.0,I have never owned a dog but this made me want to cry! The line that struck me the most was where you said “The absence of sound rings loudly through our home.” It’s an oxymoron and a good one at that. The last few lines were also very sweet.
depression,fdjr7sr,t3_elqwy9,1578484434.0,"For me it’s the constant worry about being financially stable in the future. I’m in college now but I’m always worried about never doing good enough in school and my student loans just add to my concerns. And hell, I have to get a job after all of that? And then buy a house? And all these types of insurances?? It just doesn’t sound worth it to me. Like why am I bothering getting out of one trap just to hop back into five others. I also came from a really religious family so I feel like Christianity is rooted inside me and I’m not even religious anymore but I still worry all the time that when I die I’m going to go to hell. Living doesn’t feel worth it and neither does dying so a lot of the time I’m just like..who even bothered putting me on this Earth. I feel guilty that these are the types of things that eat at me when people talk about themselves having bad childhoods and things like that. I’ve had it pretty good my whole life and it just seems like the average stuff that’s associated with adulting is what’s eating away at me. I just didn’t ask to do any of this and didn’t ask to be born, yaknow? Money, mortality, and religion are the things that eat away at me more than anything else."
OCPoetry,fdjpia5,t3_el5dux,1578482280.0,"Personally, my favorite type of poetry is the kind where the poet can actually efficiently rhyme and create a steady rhythm. This is what you, my friend, have nailed down. It shows the actual thought and planning that goes behind writing the poem and I always picture it as a sort of puzzle that you have to shift around and piece together. You did an amazing job doing that."
OCPoetry,fdjp1pg,t3_elif9a,1578481662.0,"I love the way you worded this poem, it makes it feel as though it was written a hundred years ago.   We need more poetry like this...where you can see there is actual effort used to rhyme and connect the overall theme of the poem. I think you did a very good job setting a bleak, cold scene."
Watercolor,fdjnajn,t1_fdjjf5v,1578479202.0,Thank you!!
Watercolor,fdjnab6,t1_fdjg0uf,1578479193.0,"Aw, I appreciate it!"
Watercolor,fdj9cnb,t1_fdj3rvl,1578462234.0,Thank you so much!
depression,fdizp05,t1_fdidi1t,1578454776.0,"Going to college helped me a lot too. I’m in college currently and even though it stresses me out sometimes it helps me feel like I have a purpose. Planning into the future helps me feel like I’m actually going to accomplish something and makes me be able to wake up each morning feeling determined. Some days it’s harder than others but the main thing to remember in the back of my mind is that I only have one life, and even though it sometimes feels like shit, it’s important to realize I was even lucky enough to be born. We always need to step back and realize that there are people here for us and even though our families and friends might not realize what we go through internally, they still care about us and our wellbeing. It takes patience with yourself and other people to begin the journey to getting better."
Watercolor,fdixhvc,t3_el9dz0,1578453281.0,The detail in this is amazing! Followed your instagram.
Watercolor,fdix9vy,t3_elelaw,1578453132.0,"This is beautiful! Makes me feel at peace, too."
depression,fdgcvc9,t1_fdcdqtu,1578390638.0,"I think about running away a lot. It always leads me to dreaming I’m in a place I love, like in the mountains because they bring me peace. Think about somewhere on this earth that brings you peace. Your life is not beyond the point of no return and it’s not beyond the point of being salvaged. I feel the same way about not wanting to be answerable to the people in my life regardless of whether it’s my boss or my teachers or even people that I love and care about. I think it’s an internal issue that we misinterpret for the desire to escape the place we’re at and the people we’re around. Maybe escaping those things won’t make us any happier, we first need to fix ourselves before we try to fix what surrounds us. What always helps me get my shit straight now and then is to think about my younger self. I’d advise you to carry a picture of yourself as a child and look at it when you feel like giving up. You didn’t come into this world without reason. Your actions impact others and you were built so, so uniquely. Think about your younger self and protect her/him because that little kid grew up into you and there’s no reason to love him/her any less now than you did then. Give yourself a name and live up to it. Your hobbies will come back to you, friend. And clean your room, play some music you like and take yourself out to eat. It’ll make you feel better even if you don’t think it will."
depression,fdgatur,t1_fdganlk,1578387662.0,Appreciate the response! I hope you start feeling better and sleep well.
LesbianActually,fdgaq59,t3_ekvnct,1578387517.0,I feel like I understand where you’re coming from.  I realized I was gay in 2014 and I know I’m not bi and I have a girlfriend and everything. But sometimes I try to make myself think that maybe someday I’ll end up with a guy in the future...even though it doesn’t really bring me any joy to think of it. I can admit when I see a guy that is attractive but thinking about intimacy or playing the role of the “woman” in the relationship just makes me feel uncomfortable and distressed. I think the root of this comes down to the fact I was born in a religious household. I believe in hell and heaven and even though I’m gay and cool with it all I still feel like I’m going to go to hell for being gay. I guess that’s why I sometimes hope I end up with a guy so that I won’t go to hell. I really want to marry my girlfriend someday and grow old with her though. It’s a complicated mindset I have.
depression,fdg9ygz,t3_el8nhb,1578386453.0,"Hi, it is 2:30 where I am and I found your post while I was scrolling and it caught my eye. I’m also a college sophomore and have experience running but it was during my high school years. I ran cross country and track and can’t imagine the burden you feel from your injury because the worst shit I felt was shin splints and that alone made me feel like it was fate that I would never beat my PR. I’m sorry to hear about your injury and I hope by some miracle you might wake up one morning and find that you can run faster and further than ever before. My advice would just be to rest and take it one day at a time. College will end eventually but that doesn’t mean you have to stop running! I think to an extent I understand the situation about your ex-girlfriend. The 4 hour conversation you guys had must’ve been intense. It seems as though she really likes you and is probably confused why you dropped her. It also sounds like you know she’s there for you if you need her so if you’re not going to give her another chance (which may not be a terrible idea, it’s just up to how you honestly feel about her) then you should probably send her snippets of this post and just clarify some things. That way, in the future, you won’t look back and have regrets about the way you handled things. It seems you are still thinking about her and that says a lot for you to have dropped her like that. If you feel it was necessary, by all means let it go. Emotions are not permanent, keep that in mind. No one thinks you’re a freak. Your family and friends might not get you, but everyone has had a low point in their life no matter how much they try to bury it. We’re all humans and life throws shitty situations and feelings towards us sometimes, it’s the way we handle it that determines our outcomes. Take care of yourself, remember who you were as a child and build a name for that kid. People love you, don’t give up!"
