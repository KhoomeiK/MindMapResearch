JusticeServed,feh1auj,t1_feh001d,1579107059.0,"While it can be a somewhat dangerous practice, it is often seen in lower income urban areas where people rely on what little they can make by being street food vendors. In an effort to reduce the high cost of purchasing new oil and then going through the costly and time consuming task of cleaning it daily, sewer oil is a readily available alternative. The risk of contracting disease is high while spending hours in the sewer, and possible death due to high levels of methane gasses. To mitigate these risks it is common practice to monitor potentially high yield sites. This is done by tracking the “movement” schedule of homes who are know to have people taking Orlistat. Which allows for quick and easy collection efforts."

RoastMe,fcyxv6k,t1_fcyoeu1,1578089480.0,"Dating sites/apps can be rough to navigate, parties too for that matter, especially if you have anxiety about it. I’d recommend finding a hobby that interest you and typically involves people from various backgrounds and sexes. Then join a local group that has events or meetings. It could be cycling, roller skating, cinephiles, artisan coffee, home brewing, cooking club, there are an endless amount of options. You’ll have an instant ice breaker of shared interest, as well as the progression in what you’re learning will drive conversation, which can then lead to more interaction and maybe a connection. Just don’t go into it thinking “I’M HERE TO GET LAID” mentality, and focus on expanding your social circle. Eventually you’ll make a connection with someone, or they’ll like you as a friend and possibly after getting to know you, introduce you to a friend of theirs who’s on the market as well that they think you might zing with."
