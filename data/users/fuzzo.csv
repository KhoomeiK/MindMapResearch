Most Christians are baptized because they've understood the religion to be about *them*; that *their* sins are washed away, and that this will be a continual process. No guilt! No anguish over the destruction you reek on the world and its inhabitants. And the cherry on top is that unless you renounce your pledge of loyalty to the church, after you die you go to the best fucking mall imaginable and *everything's free!* It's the perfect tribal satisfaction. 

There's no need to examine your actions after that one morning when you were sprinkled or dipped in some tap water. Who the fuck wouldn't go for that proposition? Yeah, if only it could stand up to reason.

Buddhism's just as bad. Buddhists *do not* adhere to the Buddha's admonishments. *At all*.  Like the Judaeo traditions, once you begin the path it's more like spiritual *commerce* than spiritual edification.

And that's the real problem with religions. Not that the tenets don't stand up to scientific models for investigation. Science isn't exactly the last word either.  The problem with religion is that they all convince the individual adherent that having successfully undertaken the trial of initiation all of their problems are over. They are henceforth **credentialed**  and thus will have the last word (think about what science does, guys - same thing) and anyone questioning them must have *ulterior motives*."

Well, sort of. By the time Luther (a priest) nailed that proclamation to the cathedral door the church was ridden with graft and vice so badly that it was looked upon with scorn by those who did need it (most worthwhile occupations and apprenticeships were dispensed for a price by priests or deacons) and ridicule by those who didn't.

""This is, of course, a glib account of both Christianity and paganism, filtered through modern cultural politics."" I agree with her here, though. [Dominionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_theology) is snaking its way through our culture and politics as never before in modern history. Her account is glib to say the least. One-sided and unsubstantiated too.

oklahoma,fe2qm9m,t1_fdzutpb,1578841802.0,"No, I'm sorry, but your speculations are in error. NWS is the sole provider of weather data in the US. If a weatherman on TV has priority knowledge of his area and thinks he can predict events better than they he is certainly welcome to. But the basis for his sojourn is the data his station organization leases from NOAA. If he took readings he might compare them with NOAAs for more details, but ignoring the NWS data and relying solely on his opens him personally and the station to liable for damages viewers incur due to his predictions. How many organizations are going to allow him to go that? I'll answer my own question. None so far.

You are absolutely incorrect about the graphics. Stations may decorate them as they wish and name them Super-duper X-ray Micro-macro-vision but the data that drives the graphics generators comes unadorned from NOAA.

That's because NWS provides the data for weather and climate in the entire United States."

There is no other reference. The NOAA >NWS is sole agent for all weather data dissemination in the US. TV stations use their data for one very good reason. They aren't liable for damages when their predictions don't pan out. That's because they don't predict anything. They report NWS predictions."
