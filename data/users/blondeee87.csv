There have been people get of free with no charge just a ankle monitor, due to an insanity plea, there have been cases where they have had lighter sentences, due to an insanity plea and cases where they are put into a mental facilty for shorter periods of time than the time a person who commits murder should serve, i have never once said all cases are the same or that everyone has used the insanity plea but there have been a lot, my original comment states that anyone and everyone can plea insane and a lot get lighter sentences for it, so go sit back down stupid"

She still tries to bite but I know when she is going to. I still dont like cats and if anything ever happebed to these two, god forbid, I wouldn't get more because they aren't these two they are very special cats in all the sense, I've definitely warmed up to them."

unpopularopinion,fdo0i0k,t1_fdn0cko,1578596594.0,"I do know the difference between murder and manslaughter, they are two completely different things and in no way am I saying manslaughter should be punishable like murder, what i am saying is, i have seen many cases where the accused or at least the lawyer says to make an insanity plea for a light sentence.
It is also my understanding, from what I have read and seen of Mert Ney, he was actually yelling ""allah akbar"" and articles claim he was recently converting to Islam, so as i see where you claim its a terrible example, whenever someone has been heard and seen to yell that phrase, yielding a knife/gun or whatever weapon, there is usually intent for someone to be hurt or killed so i would have to disagree with it being terrible, even if he has been known as mentally ill, as I stated earlier anyone who has the stomach to murder, not manslaughter as that usually brings trauma for years to come, is in fact mentally ill but should not be excused from full punishment."
unpopularopinion,fdn0kj5,t3_em8y2t,1578573525.0,"Coming from someone who use to bite my nails, nail biting isn't rude, it is a big sign of nervousness, being uncomfortable, anxiety and fear, maybe you should be a little more understanding, it's uncontrollable for them just like ticks are for people with tourettes. No one is perfect, maybe your body language sets them off, and makes them uncomfortable. If you are that offended by it, why don't you try making them feel comfortable in stead of judging them, would you judge someone with tourettes if they had ticks in front of you? Would that be rude too? I dont know one nail biter who does it just because they can and i most certainly didn't but I couldn't stop, not until I was more confident in social situations."
unpopularopinion,fdmz2pp,t1_fdmvx2k,1578572008.0,"My point is there are many who claim to be mentally ill and many who are, neither should be allowed to be free and should be jailed for life, there should be no exceptions for murder. I read and watch a lot of true crime cases and there are so many of them that get off on lighter sentences for pleading insane, murder is murder, it's as simple as that."
unpopularopinion,fdms9a1,t1_fdmoiah,1578563243.0,"I'm not saying being committed isn't horrible but as they stated originally, Mert Ney had previously been committed and released or escaped, it obviously isn't as easy to get out of jail and murder is murder, no matter the reason. I have been through mental illness myself and never thought of hurting another person, it is no excuse and there are none for murder."

unpopularopinion,fdmnlvr,t1_fdmmo44,1578556958.0,"What's do you mean like who? Do you not watch the news or heard of any muder cases, many who have committed murder claim to be mentally ill and get lesser sentences, very rarely do they serve life as they should, there are metal illness pleas all the time, for instance Mert Ney, he man who killed a 24 year old sex worker and stabbed another women in Sydney's Wynyard, I'm not sure of his actual sentence but straight away he was claimed to have had a mental illness, personally I think anyone who can carry out such a disgusting act is mentally ill but that should not exempt them from the full force of the law and be sentenced to life in prison, not in some mental facility."

And yes not all are doing so but a very large portion are and its only a matter of time before the rest do too, it's very sad how people's minds work in todays world."
