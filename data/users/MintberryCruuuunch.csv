It was actually brilliant, most banks had to give it all back in x amount of time with no interest and most did, so that people felt secure to not make the situation worse, to mask the real culprits and protect other banks being cleared out causing mass hystaria. It was brilliant and most banks paid it all back without interest almost immediately . Doesnt mean the bad ones didnt make out with billions in payouts before the bailed out and let the next guy deal with it. But the good banks paid it back very diligently."

Ive literally sat in a car with a gf while she walked in, and walked out with BC in under 15 minutes. they WANT to help dont feel ashamed. I happen to live across the street from a big office, im so happy to watch the women walk in and out.

politics,fe75pkf,t1_fe6al0v,1578910402.0,"also, the dems are probably just going to start to release what they know with evidence closer to election so its on peoples minds, vs earlier where the media will just distract people within two weeks. Instead of a spitfire blast over the course of the last year, I predict it will be a shotgun blast near election time. GOP will scramble, and throw trump under the bus, and the likely have someone else ready to go. Thats just my guess though, bc politics is about tactics, and dems have been methodical, and GOP has just been throwing tantrums with nothing to show for it but words. Next 11 months will be interesting for sure, at how us pawns have no control and these games are just going to begin, if they havnt already. We clearly have no control. I hate this time of year. I miss obama, regardless of your feel towards him, he was not a coward, and was eloquent and diplomatic and a man of the people that brought crowds, and spoke at graduations, and has been teary eyed on screen, with a wife that is genuine, and a good family, to this day. Name one good trait this orange clown has that has been good for the people. Their tactics have been manipulation of the public in every sense of the word. Destroying any trust in foreign relations from leadership alone. The clown is ""buddies"" with Rocket Kim? lol its so fucking laughable I literally have no idea how anyone is on the GOP side, yet, it exists. My mom even.

The studios bought the title to sell the movie bc it was a popular book at the time and the title would sell. The book was great, the movie was great, but two completely different things. Honestly if the studios just owned up to it and made their own title it would have sold better, than pawning off someones elses work off the title, which is amazing, with a product that isnt even close to the real story, if you know what i mean. I see the movie and ignore the title because it is in no way shape or form in any way similar to the real WWZ, so dont fool yourselves thinking the movie with the same title that the studio bought has anything to do with the book.
