GoldandBlack,ffaemw2,t1_ffac1je,1579733872.0,">How many generic drugs have you started making? You can't just say ""people"", because that is just a textbook answer. In the real world some products are not worth it for companies to make if they can make a larger profit with something else. 

So what you're saying is that if the current producers are charging more than the market rate, that other competitors will enter the market, and if they are not then they won't?

Sounds good.

&#x200B;

>Again you're assuming that there is infinite industrial capacity sitting idle. 

Nope, I'm assuming that people are willing to invest money.

>If another large manufacturer was to start making a newly released drug formula, then they would have to stop making one of their older drugs. 

Nope.  You take the profits you were making and re-invest them into more capital.  This is a great long-term strategy, and bonus points: you don't get taxed on it.

>If all their other drugs have high profit margins, then they would be crazy to shift over to a lower margin product. 

They wouldn't stop producing the older drugs because they've already invested into the equipment for those.  Only if they stop selling (because the market decides that it doesn't need that product at that price) will they shut down the production line.

They might not pick up a new drug if the profit margins aren't good, but then the current producers are charging a fair market rate for it, and that's ok.

&#x200B;

>I don't believe there is such a thing. The only thing I'm aware of is a patent treaty that formalizes application processes, but the patent themselves have to be registered in each and every country. 

Same difference.  Slightly more paperwork.

&#x200B;

>This is what I was referring to as ""mom & pop"". My understanding of these businesses is that they don't have the capacity to supply an entire country, but only small production runs. 

Are General Mills and Cargill ""mom & pop"" startups?  Because that's who hires us.

We get hired by large corps (like Cargill and General Mills) to do the engineering for them on whatever product line they want to add or plant they want to start up.  It pushes a bunch of the risk off of them because we're liable for the promises we make about production capabilities and quality.  Plus we have 0% down time as far as they're concerned, because we only bill them for the time we spend on the project and our costs can be included as part of the capital project cost (which means tax free).

&#x200B;

The econ for my idea is sound.  To the free market, we're essentially removing all patent protections and subsidizing research.  My only question was regarding libertarian arguments against it.  To which, it seems that aside from the obvious (increases government spending), there are no objections.  It's not a great solution, but I would support an idea like this the same way that Milton Friedman would support UBI as a replacement for welfare: it's better than what we have, even if it still isn't good."

In the US there are probably 3 major drug manufacturers capable of such production (one of which you took the patent from) and worldwide there might be about ten.  
>  
>The point being, there isn't some large pool of mom&pop manufacturing companies waiting for these things. Frankly most of these companies already offer competing treatments, so they are not idly sitting around waiting for something to do. They already make money hand over fist, so offering them a low margin competitive arrangement is not a reason for them to give up production on a more profitable drug.

Government regulation restricts the supply of manufacturing companies.  And yes, once patents expire people quickly develop generic versions.  But having 3 major drug manufacturers produce the product is infinitely better than only having 1.  Which is the case for up to 15 years on a new drug.

&#x200B;

>Where this would have to work would be getting the small producers involved. Maybe they wouldn't be able to make enough to supply an entire country, but perhaps enough to supply a city or a state. The two problems I see here is, first someone needs to capital to start such a company, which could be tens of millions for a low investment return. Second, a license to produce pharmaceuticals I doubt is easy to get. I bet it takes years to obtain, so it's not like you can justify making one drug for a few weeks to meet consumer demand. 

(A) no, even if all this does is make drugs available from 3 suppliers instead of 1, it will have made an impact.  But yes, reducing the regulations required to produce medication would also be good.

&#x200B;

>besides all this. If this was a real plan, you could already goto another country and start doing this already without worrying about US patent law. 

You could, except most countries have patent reciprocity, so that if it's patented in the US, it's patented worldwide.

&#x200B;

>The patent to my understanding doesn't tell people how to make it, it's just the final product. 

Depends on if it's a patent on the drug or on the process to make the drug.  But yes, there's not enough information to just go and build the plant from the patent.  However,

>So how many people know how to start a drug company from scratch that already aren't making enough money from one of the big companies. 

there are literally entire companies full of people who do exactly this.  They're called engineering consulting firms.  I work in the industry (ag, not pharma) and I can name a dozen different firms off the top of my head that we compete with just in my local metro area.  Each one has hundreds of qualified engineers with industry knowledge of how to make manufacturing plants.  While I'm sure the pharma market is a bit more niche, there are still probably dozens of engineering firms across the country who can design the plant.

And if you need the process, just make a super large offer for one of the engineers on the competitors line and get them to come over and help you."

Christianity,ff9lmtb,t1_fepryb6,1579715588.0,"If baptism is the only point where we can call upon his name, then how did the criminal on the cross next to Christ arrive in heaven?  He was not baptized.  What of an old man on his deathbed who hears for the first time with open ears the gospel, and wishes to accept Christ?  If he cannot be baptized, is he going to hell?

Furthermore, how is baptism not a work?  Romans and Ephesians both make it clear that salvation does not require works.  So unless you can prove that baptism is not a work, it cannot be required for salvation.

\--

>Then also note what Ananias said to Paul in Acts 22: ""The God of our fathers appointed you to know his will, to see the Just One and to hear a voice from his mouth; for you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard. And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, *calling on his name*."" 

This does not prove that baptism is required.  Baptism is the ceremonial washing away of your sins, during which calling on His name would be customary.  But that does not mean that Paul had not yet received his salvation.  Again, given that salvation cannot require works, and that baptism is a work, it cannot be required.

\--

>When Peter preached on Pentecost, he quoted the prophet Joel who wrote, ""And it shall be that whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved."" And then he told the crowd about Jesus, and finished with, ""Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the *name* of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."" 

Yes.  And notice that this was 2 steps: repentance and baptism.  Which one is required for salvation?

\--

>We call upon the name of the Lord in *baptism*. This is what Christians have always believed and always taught, ever since Jesus told the Apostles, ""Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the *name* of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."" 

The early church also believed that Christ would return in their lifetime, as had every generation since.  Tradition has a way of rendering scripture to no effect.

And notice there what Jesus says: make disciples, baptize them.  While this could be interpreted as baptism is required to make them a disciple, the Greek language tends to put the cause before the effect, so it is far more likely that Jesus was telling us to make disciples, who would then want to be baptized.

\--

>Even in the very same letter where cite Paul to emphasize the importance of confessing Jesus as Lord, Paul emphasized the central role of baptism in salvation: ""Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. For *if* we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his."" 

""If"" and ""if and only if"" (iff) are two different things.  The former indicates *a* condition, the ladder indicates *the* condition.  If I said ""if you can breathe air, you're alive"", that does not mean that you can only be alive if you breathe air.  It only means that everything that breathes air is alive.  But fish 'breathe' water, and they are also alive.

Verses such as John 14:6 (I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me) are iff statements, but verses such as Rom 6:5 do not indicate that they are iff statements, merely if statements.  So one indicator of salvation is baptism, but it is not necessarily the only one, nor is it infallible."

It's a good thing then that all sin was forgiven by Christ 2,000 years ago (1 John 2:2).  The only sin that remains is the sin of rejecting Christ (John 16:8-11), so if you have accepted him, then you have no more sin and can enter into heaven freely.

\---

>Further, the Bible says we can “fall from grace” (Gal 5:1-5, Heb 12:14-16)

Does it?  Well your Hebrews passage isn't referring to salvation (and also doesn't use the phrase ""fall from grace"" either in English or Greek).  It's referring to believers extending grace to each other and not becoming bitter about a real or perceived slight against them.

And as far as Galatians, considering the entire book is about how the law does not apply to us in Christ, a little context seems to be an order:

>**Gal 3:21** Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! *For if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the law.* **22** But the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.  
>  
>**23** Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed. **24** *So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith.* ***25*** ***But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian****,* **26** for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. **27** For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. **28** There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. **29** And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise.

And now back to your reference:

>**Gal 5:1** For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.  **2** Look: I, Paul, say to you that if you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you. **3** I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that he is obligated to keep the whole law. **4** You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace. **5** For through the Spirit, by faith, we ourselves eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness. **6** For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love. 

Paul is saying that if you submit yourself to the law, then you are falling away from God's grace.  Which given the lack of impact the law has on believers, seems unlikely to mean that you lose your salvation, but rather be referring to the fact that grace will be unable to work in your life because you do not believe that it will.

\---

>be “cut off” from the vine from which we receive divine life (Jn 15:1-6, Rom 11:18-22)

Your John passage is describing how things were under the old covenant.  Christ had not yet died, and so forgiveness of sins had not yet been extended to the world.

And again, you use a passage from a book all about God's grace to minimize it.  So some context is an order:

>**Rom 3:27** Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. **28** For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.    
>  
>**Rom 4:4** Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. **5** And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness,   
>  
>**Rom 5:9** Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. **10** For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.   
>  
>**Rom 5:20** Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,    
>  
>**Rom 7:1** Or do you not know, brothers—for I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law is binding on a person only as long as he lives? \[...\] **4** Likewise, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God.  
>  
>**Rom 7:24** Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? **25** Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.  **8:1** There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. **2** For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death.  
>  
>**Rom 10:9** because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. **10** For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. **11** For the Scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.” **12** For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him. **13** For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.” 

And now to your passage:

>**Rom 11:3** Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry **14** in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them. **15** For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead? **16** If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches.  
>  
>**17** But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree, ***18*** *do not be arrogant toward the branches.* If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you. **19** Then you will say, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.” **20** That is true. *They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith*. So do not become proud, but fear. **21** For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. **22** Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off. 

Notice here that (A) Paul is talking about not looking down on the Jews, not about salvation, (B) Paul says that they were broken off because of their unbelief (in Jesus as Christ), and (C) Paul says that as long as you continue in His kindness (continue believing in Jesus as Christ), then you will remain.  And only if you reject Jesus as Christ will you be cut off.

Which is exactly what I said.  You cannot 'lose' your salvation, but you can reject it.  In which case your name would be stricken from the Lamb's Book of Life."

Christianity,fenu9f0,t1_fentfu8,1579290828.0,"# 3) How might someone lose their salvation?

All of this up unto this point would make it seem that it is impossible to *lose* your salvation.  And while I agree with that, I do find that you can *reject* your salvation, and I would be remiss in not explaining that.

The book of Hebrews talks about Christians who lose their salvation in two passages:

>**6:4** For it is impossible, in the case of those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit, **5** and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come, **6** and then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance, since they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt.  
>  
>**10:26** For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, **27** but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries.

Now, these passages have been used to fearmonger and intimidate Christians.  But Christ has not given us a spirit of fear. In fact, perfect love casts out fear and God is perfect love (2 Tim 1:7, 1 John 4:18, 1 John 4:7).  So if this passage is causing you fear, then there is probably a misunderstanding somewhere.

So let's analyze these a bit more and see what we can extract:

Heb 6:4-6 describes someone who is:

* enlightened,
* tasted the heavenly gift,
* shared in the Holy Spirit,
* tasted the goodness of the word of God, and
* tasted the powers of the age to come

These are the only people who are covered by the ""impossible to return them to repentance"" clause.  Now, the exact definitions of these are up for debate, but certainly we can say that based on some of those last ones, this is someone who is a very mature believer who has had serious experiences with God.  These are the only people who are even qualified to be able to lose their salvation.

After all, if they just meant ""was saved"" then they wouldn't have listed 5 different descriptions in increasing order of miraculousness.  In all probability ""saved"" is enlightened, and everything else goes up there.  So if you haven't done any miracles or *tasted the powers of heaven*, you are disqualified from being able to lose your salvation.

I once heard this described like if a child decided they didn't want to be part of their family any more.  If little Jimmy Smith decided that he didn't want to be a Smith anymore, that doesn't mean much.  Sure, the government might check to make sure that his parents weren't abusing him, but he doesn't have the authority to give up his name because he is too young.  But if Jimmy grows up and as an adult wants to give up his name, he can go to the courthouse and fill out some paperwork and become a Jones or a Stevens or whatever.  And so in the same way, if you are not a mature believer, you can't reject your salvation.

&#x200B;

So that's who, but we still need to know about how.  Well fortunately we can look up the greek word used for ""deliberate"" in Heb 10:26, and see if it was used anywhere else in the Bible.  That might help us figure out what it means.

It turns out, this word appears in only one other place in scripture: (1 Pet 5:2)

>**5:1** So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed: **2** shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you; not for shameful gain, but eagerly; **3** not domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock.

Now, the context of this verse doesn't really apply to our discussion, but we do see how the word is used: *willingly* is contrasted against *compulsion*.  So without even having to know what the greek word means, we can see how it is used.  We know that whatever *willingly* means, it must be different from *compulsion*.

So this paints a much different picture.  We aren't talking about the sort of sin where you don't *want* to do it, but you do it anyway.  Rather we are talking about the sort of sin where you carefully decide to do it.

And in looking at the greek of these two words, being in an emotional state would also be under compulsion.  So if you sinned because your child just died and you're angry at God, well that doesn't count.  Even if you were a mature believer, it wasn't willful.

But there's another wrench that can be thrown in using John 16:8-11 and 1 John 2:2.  This post is already super long, so I'll just tell you that they show that the only sin that counts here is the sin of rejecting Christ.  So you have to be a mature believer who willfully says ""I don't want to be saved"" in order to 'lose' your salvation.  Which isn't really losing it, as much as it is rejecting it."
Christianity,fenu92a,t1_fentfu8,1579290822.0,"# 2) How does sin, works, and salvation interact?

Eph 2:8-9 and Romans 3:28 make it clear that salvation comes apart from works.  Works are always a result of your salvation, not the cause of it.

Now, if something does not come by works, then it cannot be maintained or lost through works or a lack thereof.  If I gave you a car ""without payment"" and then later demanded payment, that would no longer be ""without payment"" it would just be ""with delayed payment"".

And by a similar note, a lack of works cannot cause you to lose your salvation because not doing something is a work just like doing it is.  And so the previous logic applies: if salvation comes without works, then works must never be involved with your obtaining or maintaining your salvation.

Now, the question is, is sin a work?  Well, the definition of work in scripture is ""toilsome labor"".  So while sin itself might not be, not sinning certainly is.  As I'm sure you can agree, it takes a great deal of toilsome labor to avoid sinning.

And that's what really matters.  If not sinning is a work, then it cannot be required to obtain or maintain your salvation.  The entire book of Galatians is written to address this point.  It was written because a group of Christians called the Judaizers had come through Galatia preaching that Christians had to follow the law.  Paul was no incensed about this that he said in the opening statements of his letter: (Gal 1, *emphasis mine*)

>**6** I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— **7** not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. **8** But *even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you,* ***let him be accursed***.

In the greek this is saying: *give them a wide berth, as if you expect lightning to strike them down and you don't want to be near them or in any way associated with them for fear that you too would be struck.*

But perhaps it is the end of chapter 2 into chapter 3 that makes the strongest point:

>**2:21** I do not nullify the grace of God, *for if righteousness were through the law,* ***then Christ died for no purpose***.  
>  
>**3:1** O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. **2** Let me ask you only this: *Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith?*

And to be clear: while Paul is specifically speaking about the Jewish law, he is covering all forms of legalistic rules.  Ritual has a place, but it is not a rule that must be followed.  Remember, this is the same author who said twice in the same letter: (1 Cor 6)

>**12** Everything is permissible (allowable and lawful) for me; but not all things are helpful (good for me to do, expedient and profitable when considered with other things). Everything is lawful for me, but I will not become the slave of anything *or* be brought under its power.

Now, while Paul is trying to remind people that things that were traditionally sinful are still not good ideas, he is making one thing clear: there is no act which now can separate us from our Father.

>For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 8:38-39)"
Christianity,fenu8d1,t1_fentfu8,1579290811.0,"# 1) How do you get saved?

This one is pretty easy.  Romans 10:9-13 is probably one of the most well known passages in scripture.  And it says:

>**9** \[I\]f you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. **10** For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. \[...\] **13** *For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”*

That last verse is the one I want to emphasize: everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.  Now, depending on where you fall on the calvinism-arminianism debate, you might say that only certain people are even capable of calling on the name of the Lord, but this scripture is clear: if you do, you are saved.

And this isn't some big complicated thing either.  We see one of the two criminals who was crucified with Jesus say: (Luke 23:42)

>“Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.”

It didn't take a bunch of introspection.  He didn't have to ask ""are you sure"" or ""do you have any doubts"".  All it took was ""remember me when you come into your kingdom"" and Jesus even confirmed it in the next verse that he would go to heaven with Him.

So if you believe that God raised Christ from the dead and have confessed Him as your Lord, then you are saved."
Christianity,fentfu8,t3_eq2pp9,1579290566.0,"A lot of people have complicated things.  Partly due to misunderstanding, and partly due to how countercultural the idea of salvation as a free and unconditional gift is.  Especially today, everyone expects things to cost them (as the saying goes: *nothing is free, and if you aren't being charged, that means you're the product*).  So the idea of a gift that is not only completely free, but also given without condition, is unbelievable.

So let's break it down into 3 points:

1. How does one get saved?
2. How does sin, works, and salvation interact?
3. How might someone lose their salvation?

*TL:DR: if you just want to take my word for it:*

1. You get saved by believing and speaking.  And if you think you believe, you believe.
2. Not sinning is a work, works cannot affect your salvation, therefore sin cannot affect your salvation.
3. You cannot lose your salvation.  You can reject it, but only if you are a mature (miracle working, heaven visiting) believer who does so without emotions or fleshly compulsions driving it.

And?  I was countering your example of rich people wasting money.  If you had said ""poor people waste money by buying brand new cars"" I would have said the same thing.  They find value in that car.

I can't be expected to expound on every enumeration of a given argument.  My posts tend to be long and wordy as it is, and that would only make it worse.

&#x200B;

>Okay, by that rationale, how is it possible for *anyone* to waste money?

I already explained this, but I'll give it another go.

No one can say that *another* person wasted money.  But *you* can say that *you* wasted money.

Suppose I saw that $300 box of tic tacs that you mentioned.  And I thought to myself: *Gosh, for $300 those must be the world's best tic tacs.  This store always has good deals and I've never made a purchase here that I wasn't happy about.  Plus, I love mints, so I gotta have them!  $300 is a lot, but they must just be that good!*

Now, with the information I currently have, I value those mints at at least $300.  If I didn't, then I wouldn't be buying them.  Now, it could be that I don't have all the information.  Maybe they're a collectors item and not intended for consumption.  Maybe it's just a social experiment on behalf of the tic tac company to see if anyone will buy them.  Or maybe they really are that good.

I could spend some time learning more about them.  Perhaps I find out that they're a collectors item because the mints are from a run where they forgot to add the sugar, and these taste awful.  In that case I would no longer value them at $300, and wouldn't buy them.  Or maybe I find out that they have a secret ingredient that gives you superpowers!  Now I value them at way more than $300.

But the time it takes to learn about them has a cost.  There's the cost of my time, there's the cost of my effort to go research them, there's potentially a perceived social cost if ""everyone already knows about them"" and you come across as an idiot for not knowing.  And if I perceive these costs to be higher than the cost of the tic tacs, then I am actually *saving* money by not researching them.  And then I have to go with my initial evaluation which is that they are worth $300.

Now, once I buy the mints and try one, all of that potential collapses into a single reality.  Much like a particle in a quantum superposition, there were many possibilities (at least from my perspective), but my sampling of the tic tacs has collapsed reality to one.  If they're just generic tic tacs, but cost $300, then yeah, I would say I wasted money.  But only I can say it.  You can't say it.  My boss can't say it.  An economist can't say it.  I am the only one who can evaluate if that purchase was a waste or not.

So I should have been a bit more precise (if also more wordy) with my original statement.  I should have said that rich people tend not to waste money, as wasting money is antithetical to the production of wealth.  And that wasting money is in the eye of the spender, and no tangible examples of what you or I might call *wasteful spending* can indicate otherwise.

I have a buddy who goes to a barber for a haircut every 2 weeks.  I find that wasteful.  I get a haircut 2-3 times a year (I get it cut really short and then let it grow out).  Does that mean that he is wasting money?  He's my friend, should I go say something to him?  He and his wife just bought a house, so I'm sure they could use the extra cash.  No.  Because he finds value in keeping his hairstyle consistent.  I don't, so I don't spend the money for it.

This is the core tenet of liberalism and tolerance: acceptance of others, and a desire to not impose your own value system upon them (usually up until the point where their value system allows them to infringe upon your rights).  And the first step in reaching this goal is to accept that others value things differently than you do, and that your evaluations of their expenditures as ""wasteful"" is irrelevant because you are not the one making the purchase."

You're mostly right.  Individuals can still waste money, but the only one who knows if a purchase was a waste of money or not is the one who made it.  I can determine after a purchase that I spent too much money for that.  Basically I am acknowledging that the value that I thought it would bring and the value that it actually brought me do not match up.

This is view is a good thing, because it means that we respect the life choices of those who are different from us and do not impose our own values upon them when what they are doing does not harm us.

And airlines do not try to work out how rich you are, they try to work out how much they can charge you.  Those are two very different things.  They are comparing the value you place on the flight (by how frequently you look at it) and trying to keep the prices high for you to make as much as possible.

Charging people based on wealth is only a recent development.  And if anything, the rich were given discounts in hopes that they would continue to trade with you.

Even this, you're reading more into it than is reasonable.  There is a slight correlation between *sexual satisfaction* (not performance) and porn consumption, but correlation does not equal causation.

One of my old stats professors explained it to me this way once, and it helped me:

>Go back in time to when the first studies linking lung cancer and smoking came out.  These studies did not prove that smoking caused cancer.  Even though it seems obvious now, it was entirely possible that cancer caused smoking, or that both were caused by a third, unrelated variable.

>All of these were equally likely results before further testing was done to determine which direction (if either) the causal arrow pointed.

So I'm not for all time rejecting the possibility that porn can cause physical issues (nor am I arguing that it does not present psychological/spiritual ones, in fact I think it does).  I am merely saying that any claims that porn causes physical changes to your sexual experience are not based in fact.

&#x200B;

>If you want to assume that the lack of causation is due to it not existing, rather than limitations which are inherent to the gathering of statistics, you can.

Things are proved to be causative all the time, even through statistical means.  The difficulty of proving causation is not a reason to conflate causation and correlation.

But you seem to think that I believe that the causation does not exist.  That is not the case.  It is clear that there is no evidence that the causation exists, which means only that we should not assume that such a causation exists.  That does not mean that we should assume that no causation exists.  I am neither doubtful nor non-doubtful about the existence of causation.  There is simply no evidence to support the claim.

&#x200B;

>However, I tend to think God's Word discourages certain sins (like lust) not arbitrarily, but for reasons which often involve our own benefit and well-being. 

I agree.  But as I stated earlier in this post, I don't believe that porn is consequence free.  I believe there are psychological and spiritual effects to it.  I am only debating the existence of physical effects.  I am perfectly comfortable in believing that God chose to discourage lust because of the spiritual and psychological effects alone, and that there did not need to be physical effects for Him to discourage it.

Yes.  That was the main point of my post.  But these difficulties do not excuse jumping to a conclusion.  Especially when you are jumping to a conclusion that supports your own preconceived notions.  It is when the evidence seems to support your own position that you must be the most careful to ensure that you are not misunderstanding or misrepresenting it.

The only exceptions that come to mind for this are taxes and bail.  And there are two different reasons for these (or perhaps they are the same reason, but opposite sides of it).

Bail is set by wealth because the purpose of the fee is not to actually collect the money.  Innocent or guilty, if you show up to court for your trial, you get your bail money back.  The point of bail is to be able to let you out from prison (reducing the burden on society to provide for you, as well as to not force you to spend time in jail before you are found guilty or not-guilty), but still be reasonably sure that you will come back (if you don't you lose all of your bail).  So the amount of bail is set (in theory) such that you have the ability to pay it, but that it would be very painful for you if you broke it (it doesn't work that way in reality, but that's a problem with implementation, and isn't relevant to this discussion).

Taxes are set by wealth because the government spends an obscene amount of money (for reference, the entire wealth of Jeff Bezos would fund the federal government for \~10 days, and the entire wealth of the Forbes 10 richest people would fund the federal government for 67 days), and they would place an impossible burden on many people (the fed spends \~$10k/person, and State governments spend another $5k for a total tax burden of $15k/person).  So they charge wealthier people more because it is the only way to fund their excessive spending (even though they spend 20% more money than they make in taxes).

So, what is the purpose of a fine?  If it is only supposed to deter people from doing something, then you have a case that it should be based on wealth/income (assuming you are OK with the principle behind the bail system, which many are not).  If it is supposed to cover the cost to society for someone doing the thing that was prohibited, then it should be a flat fee, same as any other fee."

It is not us that makes up for the failures of our flesh (our sin), but rather Christ through his intercession.

Furthermore, this word is in the present tense.  So not just when you got saved, but at every moment after He is interceding on our behalf.

As we grow to love God more and more, our desire to sin will decrease.  But we must always remember which causes which.  *It is our love of Him that brings about the lack of sin, not our lack of sin that brings about our love for Him.*  If we were able to stop sinning on our own, there would have been no need for Christ to be sacrificed.  We need to live our lives always remembering that ""where sin abounds, God's favor and blessing for our lives covers, abounds, and super abounds far beyond the sin"" (Rom 5:20), so that we may ""come boldly to the throne of grace, where we obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need"" (Heb 4:16)"

The only difference is that the government takes it from your employer (or the store charges you extra at the point of purchase) so that you never realize how much you lose, and that it is a progressive tax rate rather than a flat tax amount.

By considering abortion in rape cases we are saying the embryo/fetus is not valuable in and of itself. If this is the case, then why force someone to carry a fetus to term any time. 

Not true.  We are willing to kill adults if they commit sufficiently evil acts.  Does that mean that all adults carry no value? No.

Perhaps I should explain my reasoning and position better.  I lean heavily libertarian.  One of the results of this is that I believe that the government should never violate the rights of the individual.  The only exception to this is if that individual has/is violating the rights of another.

On the face of it, the government should not ban abortion since that would violate the right to body autonomy of the individual.  And in fact the fact that the child's life would be lost does not matter since other people do not have the right to use your body for any reason without your consent.  Regardless of how much value that person has.  If the dalai lama asked for my help to save his life, I would be under no obligation to use my body to save him, even though his life certainly has value.

But, as I made the case in my OP, once you have consented you have an obligation to care for your child.  Essentially you voluntarily surrendered your right to body autonomy in order to have sex (both men and women do this, since men will be on the hook for child support, and money is just a representation of actions you took with your body).

*So we conclude that abortion should be outlawed since you have a duty to care for your child (at least until they are born and can be cared for by others).*

However, we assumed in that statement that the mother consented to the child.  We agreed that having sex was implicit consent, but it is possible for a woman to become pregnant without having consented to having sex.  And in that case, effectively her signature has been forged on the contract of parenthood.

So in this case, she has been forced into a contract.  In any other situation she would not have to fulfil the obligations of that contract (obviously, since her signature was forged).  And that would mean that she has no obligation of care for her child.  And without that obligation, we revert to the first conclusion.  For me, that means she must be allowed because the government doesn't get to infringe upon your rights (someone with a different political leaning might have a different first assumption).  It's still an immoral action on her part: she is actively choosing to end the life of someone who has done no wrong.  But I don't believe that it's the government's job to make people do what is right, only to ensure that everyone's rights are protected.

&#x200B;

That's why I support the *concept* of a rape exception.  But I'm also a realist, and I understand that if we demand proof, women will not be able to make the choice before the child is born (so they effectively don't get a choice).  And if we don't demand proof, then obviously anyone who wants an abortion just says ""I was raped"" and gets to have an abortion (effectively, there is no ban).

So as a matter of practicality, I do not find that the 0.5% of abortions justify the acceptance of the practice in general.  But if someone presents to me an option that allows raped women to have the choice (which I hope they do not take) but that makes abortion for other reasons illegal, I will happily support it."
changemyview,fcxvm1a,t1_fcxj27s,1578071163.0,"I would argue that broken condoms, failed birth control, and an unplanned pregnancy all fall under ""risk accepted"" when one has sex.  No action is without risk, and you must accept that risk (explicitly or implicitly) when engaging in it.

Rape is the only place where I can reasonably see abortion being acceptable, because no consent to any action was given.  And it certainly would be difficult (nearly impossible in our current court system) to have a trial and determine that the mother was raped in time to let her get an abortion.  So I can see why you might argue to blanket allow abortion for the sake of those who are raped.

But from what data we have ([guttmacher national survey](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/tables/370305/3711005t3.pdf) and [florida compulsory reporting](https://ahca.myflorida.com/MCHQ/Central_Services/Training_Support/docs/TrimesterByReason_2018.pdf)), abortion is hardly ever (0.14%-0.5% of cases) done because the mother was raped.  So while I understand the argument, I can't reasonably agree that for the sake of *at most* 0.5% of abortions, all of them should be allowed.  If someone can suggest a restricted way to allow raped women the option of abortion without making it blanket acceptable, I would 100% support it.  But I can't in good faith support what is possibly 800,000+ deaths a year in the US alone for the sake of 0.5% of them being children of rape victims.  And that doesn't touch on the moral quagmire that is killing the child because of the sins of their father.

You can give up your child, but you must care for them until such time as the government (or a private agency) can come and replace you as caregiver for the child.  If a mother gave up her child for adoption, and then just left them in a park, they would be charged with child endangerment *even if no harm came to the child*.  And if harm did come to them, it would be as a direct result of the mother's negligence, and so she would be charged for it.

That's a good point.  However, I would argue that it's a bit erroneous here.  There is a high likelihood that the fetus will 'recover' from this medical condition.

>While parents are obligated to provide safety to their children- they are not required to give up their bodily autonomy to do so.  For example, if we change your example from drowning to a medical issue like kidney failure, a parent is not obligated to donate one of their kidneys to save a child.

I agree to some extent, but at the same time, what you chose to do with your body (like work at a job) would also be covered under body autonomy.  And parents are required to use the results from that work to provide for their children.  So we have already suppressed body autonomy to one degree, but not to another.  Given the temporary nature of pregnancy, it seems to me that it is more closely related to a job than the donation of a kidney.

However I've always found that those who made this claim were more motivated by ideology than science in their description of the fetus as a parasite or 'non-human'.  Because from a *scientific* perspective, the fetus is (A) alive, (B) a member of the human species, and (C) not part of the mother (significantly different genetics).  Arguably that means that the fetus is a living human (from a scientific perspective).

But that's the *scientific* definition of human.  And it's not science that tells us that killing a human is wrong, that's philosophy.  And the philosophical definition of a ""human"" (or more accurately, a human who we deem as having 'human rights') is fundamentally a subjective one.  

At best, we can create a definition and see how it interacts with the examples we have, and judge if it properly matches who we deem as 'human', but that is dangerously close to being a texas sharpshooter.  After all, you first decide who is human, then create a rules which matches your decision.

That's not to say that it's useless.  After creating a rule, we can judge it separately from the people it includes/excludes and judge it's morality, but that's a step that is rarely done."
