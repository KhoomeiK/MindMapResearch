CasualConversation,ffeqhhm,t1_ffenj55,1579860437.0,"Well, I did it. Told him that I really like him, told him that I don't want just a fling or a hookup, all of it. He said he's the same way, but...he's not in the right mindset for a relationship, so we should just be friends right now. Unfortunately we had the conversation through texting so we didn't really get into details, but he said he'd tell me the whole story sometime.

I'd rather be friends than not have him in my life at all, but damn is it disappointing. Although maybe this is time for me to do some work on myself and work on my patience and learn how to take it easy and go with the flow better. It sucks too because I think he tried at first and then realized he's not ready, and I don't think he knows what to do to be ready. But I guess in the end it's better to wait and make sure all the necessary healing is done rather than bring baggage and stuff into something new. Like, what if he was my running buddy, and he broke his leg. I'd just have to wait for that to heal; he can't run on a broken leg no matter how badly I want to run with him.

I think I'm rambling a bit now. This sucks."
CasualConversation,ff6ukor,t1_ff5g29o,1579635187.0,"I messaged him a little bit after the date to say I had a really nice time, and he responded back that he did too...then he apologized for being awkward and said he doesn't want to rush into anything and we get along really well. I agreed that slow is good and then we started joking around again. I don't think he was awkward? But maybe he just hides it well. He asked for a hug at the end of the date and gave me a peck on the cheek which I returned. 

Didn't get a chance for lunch today because work got crazy, but we texted a bit in the evening, mostly just joking around. I just worry that I overthink things in a way that other people don't, and I feel like I should just be relaxing and ""going with the flow"" or whatever, when in reality I'm already thinking ten steps ahead. 

We actually both have to move for work at the end of the year, so if this thing turns into a relationship--we're either looking at breaking up in 10 months or committing to long distance for a couple years. I can't just not think about that, but I feel like if I bring it up he's going to think I'm crazy for already thinking that far into the future when we've only had one date.

Man, thanks for talking this out with me. I really appreciate the advice. I agree that communication is key, but I'd rather have conversations in person instead of through text. Ideally I want to tell him that I'm just going to be blunt and forward, and then tell him that I really like him and I want to see where this goes. And that I'm fine with going slow with it because rushing in to sex has ruined things for me in the past."
CasualConversation,ff59fqu,t1_ff3m8yp,1579584234.0,"Hey thanks for the advice! I think a lot of the time women don't make the first move because they're afraid that being too forward will scare the guy away, or he'll think she's promiscuous or something. 

We went on a date last night and had a blast. It was just dinner and drinks but we talked for like three hours and the conversation flowed super easily. Afterwards I invited him up to watch a movie but he said he had to get going (it was getting late), and now I'm worried he might think I was just trying to have sex, which I really wasn't. I really did want to just hang out more and watch a movie. But then I suggested we get lunch the following day (we work in the same office building) so I think even if I'm not physically making a move, it's still making a move of sorts?"
