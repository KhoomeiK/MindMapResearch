  This happened about 7 or 8 years ago. 
  I met up with a girl I met online at a bar. We were both pretty dark-minded and liked a lot of the same movies, so we clicked. We also grew up not too far from each other, which wasn't a common thing in my dating experience. It was going well! We'd had like 3 or 4 drinks. She asked if i wanted to go back to her place (we drove, against our better judgement). We got there and she made me a drink. I told her i couldn't stay out too late because I had work in the morning. We were drinking and talking about psychedelic drugs. She suddenly decided to call her mushroom dealer. I told her i was getting tired and probably wouldn't be up for mushrooms that night. She offered me Ritalin. I said that didn't seem like a good idea. She kept pouring me drinks. I was a lush and was thirsty as hell for sex, but I was starting to pump the brakes. She eventually was holding the ritalin pill up to my mouth though, so I relented, took it and washed it down with more vodka. The mushroom guy came. She took some and offered me some. I said fuck it and took a few. We went to her bed and sat and started watching youtube videos and talking. She kept giving me more mushrooms. I ate another pinch but then refused the next few offers. After like 15 minutes, we started making out. We were starting to get to 3rd base, but then she pushed me off, with some force. I got back and apologized. She acted surprised and asked me what was wrong. I said it seemed that she wanted me to back off. She said she didn't as if i was being totally dense and pulled me back over. We recommenced, but then she started pushing me again. This happened a couple more times until i gave up and got comfy on the bed. ""What's wrong?!"" She asked. ""I'm done,"" i said,""this isn't working for me."" The mushrooms were starting to kick in and I was starting to get freaked out. She kept trying to get me to engage again, but I told her I was getting tired and wanted to go to sleep. She was shaking me and telling me to wake up. I sort of passively tried to get her to just come to me, but she didn't want to lay down and kept trying to get me to sit up. Then she said, ""Oh I get it."" She began asking me what my ""fetlife"" name was and my ""little"" name. I didn't know what she was talking about and I told her so. She kept trying to get me to come out to her, admit that I was a ""little"" and that she could be my ""mommy."" She told me she still had diapers in her closet from her last ""little"" and that she'd put one on me and breastfeed me if I got up and played with her. I just did my best to ignore her. She started putting her boob in my mouth. Of course, I couldn't resist that, but then she'd pull it away and say that i couldn't have anymore until I got up and played with her. I refused and kept trying to sleep. She said I was a ""bad boy."" As i was about to drift off, i felt her fingers trying to put a ritalin pill in my mouth. I spit it out and exclaimed ""what the fuck are you doing?"" She then started acting like I was being mean to her. She berated me and shoved me, but i ignored her. When she slapped me in the chest i pushed her arms away and told her to ""fuck off"" and that she was a ""crazy bitch."" She backed off, but kept talking about how I was mean. Eventually, she went to the bathroom. I realized that this was a perfect escape window, so I grabbed my things and dashed out the apartment to my car. I drove about a half-mile and pulled over. My heart was pounding, but I was so tired. It was about 4:30 in the morning. I put my seat back and fell asleep for a couple hours. 
  I went to work in the morning. It was a rough day, as you might imagine. I got a text around lunch time. It was her. She asked why I left and why I was being such a pain all night and told me it was rude to leave without saying goodbye. I told her that I felt like she'd assaulted me. She was shocked that I felt that way. I told her that I didn't want to see her again. 
  I wish I could say I didn't see her again, about a year later she hit me up. She told me that she had a cute new puppy and that I should come over and see it. Again, I was still thirsty as hell and had very little self-respect, so I went over. We ended up dating for about 3 weeks, but that's a story for another day (spoiler: there was no ageplay)"
