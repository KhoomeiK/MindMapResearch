People say this shit all the time, and I kinda get where they're coming from... But let's be real for a second here. You're on Reddit. You probably converse with 15 year olds and 55 year olds every day, and you often don't know the difference from one to the other, unless they explicitly state it, or certain subjects are discussed. 

Turns out humans who have gone through puberty have a little common ground regardless of age...

Sure, we're obviously all in different places in life. But it's not as if we're talking about 8 year olds. Humanity packs a lot of maturation between the ages of 11 and 16 or so.

To put it in a slightly different context by analogy, things go from G to PG to PG-13, to R to NC-17 real fast... 

And to run with that metaphor... Most 8 year olds probably wouldn't ""get"" a film like Pulp Fiction, or Fight Club, and many adults wouldn't want them exposed to it. But by 16, most would be at a level where they can understand and appreciate most of that stuff without a problem, and they're mature enough to handle the content. (You could even extend that to something arguably more ""adult"" like Scarface, or Halloween.)


On the other end of the spectrum, there are plenty of 35 and 45 year olds who love Guardians of the Galaxy, or The Avengers. Or hell, even Pixar or Disney cartoons. 

In a way, media illustrates how much common ground humans have above a certain age.

So I guess ""more than you might think at first,"" is the answer to your question."
trashy,ffaqamc,t1_ffajffo,1579741980.0,"Generally speaking, 16 year olds are not ""children"" in the way we normally think of that concept, and there's a reason 16 is the age of consent in most of the world..."

Your friend who is ""prone to seizures"" ... Do they happen to take meds to control those seizures?

phenibut,ff7uzvo,t1_ff6k62g,1579659001.0,">There are people of doing 10gs of phenibut daily as their tolerance raise so thing so even though 2,5g daily (spread around multiple doses) might sound much but isn't crazy high.

Maybe that was your first mistake, no offense.

I think this idea that ""2.5g isn't really a high dose"" needs to die, like yesterday already.

250mg is a therapeutic dose. 

Rx guidelines recommend 750mg per day, typically in *three* divided doses.

2.5g is over 3 times the *daily max* for therapeutic dosing. It's 10 times higher than a single therapeutic dose. Most other recreational drugs would kill you, going that high over recommended-- or at least make you *wish* you were dead lol

And you took that for ""years"" straight.

I think it's possible you were so dependent at that point, that the level in your system dipped low enough that your seizure threshold dropped. Maybe you did something else to temporarily lower it.

Either way, 2.5g **is** a high dose.

Yes, some people eat 10g. I've heard reports of 15g. Still doesn't mean that's perfectly safe. You have to account for differences in personal chemistry, tolerance, and raw luck.

I've literally shot 10 bags of heroin into my veins *all at once* before. Does that mean that behavior is safe?

Of course not...I was lucky, and had a high tolerance.

And I know there's a great chance this post will be downvoted by someone who wants to defend or justify their 10 gram doses (13+ times the daily max,  *40 times* a single therapeutic dose!) but that doesn't detract from the truth of what I'm saying. 

If the community doesn't learn to moderate itself, this could easily be the next big ban."

No offense to any younger people among us, but kids end up ruining between 90 and 99% of ""legal highs"" and psychoactive supplements online.

They're the ones who order mail order drugs to their parents house, the ones who OD and get LEO and media attention, get caught in school, and post fucking videos to YouTube, for fuck sake, talking about and abusing said drugs, for other kids and the media to find.

Happened with salvia. Happened with jwh-018 / ""fake pot,"" happened with methylone, and it could easily happen again.

Not sure kids are responsible for the kratom thing, but they probably haven't helped it.

And yes, adults OD and sometimes do dumb shit too (please stop that lol.) But the thing is... No one gives a fuck about an adult druggie fucking up their own life. But a kid who's even moderately at risk? That's a matter for the media, the law, and piles of massive public freakout. 

And I get it, I was a teen too. They had legal highs way back then, believe it or not.

You know what I didn't do when I was a kid? Have drugs mailed to my parents house. Try to trip, in my parents house. Or do anything that might alert the media to the existence of certain substances.

Because I recognized that I was granted *privileged knowledge*, and I had a responsibility to keep that safe, so other people could benefit from it as well.

Getting caught with ""legal highs"" isn't better because ""it's like totally legal, bro"" -- it's actually much worse. Maybe not for you-- but certainly for everyone else."
