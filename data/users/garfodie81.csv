UpliftingNews,ffhagpc,t1_ffh9pcx,1579927886.0,"Yep, this is how I function. Order the expensive shit ASAP in January (insulin, pump supplies) to hit deductible and then pay less for the next 90 day order.

UpliftingNews,ffha64q,t1_ffh91x5,1579927621.0,"In pumps you use fast acting insulin as a basal rate, dispersed in small increments every hour, to keep your blood sugar stable. So that’s my 40, plus extra units if I eat anything.

I use Fiasp or Novolog. My insurance stopped covering Humalog, and doesn’t even show Lispro as an option yet. Yay bureaucracy!"
UpliftingNews,ffh8t4k,t1_ffh5wpj,1579926406.0,Yes! I had savings cards (Novo nordisk for Fiasp/Novolog . . . there are others) but they are usually limited to a certain amount or time frame (a year or two). I’ll be hitting year 27 since diagnosis this summer so that time has passed for me!
UpliftingNews,ffh89q8,t1_ffh6mrz,1579925941.0,"10 units a day for a basal rate seems very low for anyone, except children. I’ve been diabetic for 26 years now, so I admit my basal rate is kinda getting up there to 40 units daily with a pump. Then you have to account for carbs in meals, which could add average 5-10 more units per meal (or more, just depends on what you’re eating). So yeah, I may have to pay more for my fuckload of insulin, but the price shouldn’t be obscene in the first place."

I stopped using them nearly 20 years ago when better insulins (Humalog, Novolog, Lantus, etc) came on the market.

Edit to address questions and misinformation:

I use Fiasp/Novolog in an insulin pump. My insurance stopped covering Humalog and does not show its “generic” Lispro as an option yet.

I am well aware of savings/discount cards. I used Novo nordisk’s savings card for Novolog, but those only provide for 2 years.

I stopped using the “Walmart insulins” N and R almost 20 years ago upon the insistence of my new (at the time) doctor, who was absolutely aghast that I still used them. There is a reason they are cheap now - technology has surpassed them. They will keep you from dying, but the other insulins used now help you control blood sugar faaaaaar better and will keep you healthier, and alive, longer. There is a difference there.

I am on a HDHP through my husband’s employer. No, HDHP’s usually don’t make sense for people with chronic health conditions, but it is the only option available. The out of pocket max for this plan is $5000, which is a decent deal considering we could be paying ACA premiums out of pocket, plus Rx and doctor visit copays and coinsurance. 

Type 1 Diabetics *can not* control blood sugars by avoiding carbs. Your blood sugar will still rise even if you starve yourself. Google “diabetes before insulin” if you want to traumatize yourself with pictures of skeletal diabetic children who did just that and died horrible deaths anyway.

There are 2 main types of diabetes. I have Type 1, the autoimmune kind where your body stops making and processing it’s own insulin. Most diabetics taking insulin are Type 1, but more and more Type 2’s are using insulin now as new insulins come on the market. So comments like “Stop eating sugar, fatty” are not only ignorant and misinformed, but also make you a raging asshole."

Sciatica,ffd26jb,t3_esya8t,1579811945.0,"If you can spend $1K on a chiropractor, you can afford a MRI. Stop going to the chiro and save your money, ‘cause it’s not working, and could be making things worse. If you don’t know what the injury is, you won’t know how it can be treated."
diabetes,ff9tdvg,t3_esd4oh,1579720848.0,"I have had 3 babies. All perfectly healthy, ranging from 8 lb 8 oz to 9 lb 6 oz. I’ve never been under better control but I definitely wasn’t perfect. Aside from blood sugar control and healthy growth/ultrasounds, the doctors were most concerned about placenta health. Diabetic’s placentas tend to “crap out” sooner than those of non-diabetics. All that means is a lot more doctor visits in the 3rd trimester and doctors not letting you get too far past 38 weeks.

The thing is, when it comes to birth defects, they may or may not happen, despite diabetes. It’s just a risk you take.

You can buy extra syringes without a prescription. 

What insulin does your insurance cover? I.E. long acting (Lantus, levemir, toujeo) and short acting (humalog, fiasp, novolog). You’d think they cover at least one of each. 

I’ve never heard of a doctor advocating for the older generation insulins (N/R) because otherwise it’s “too many” shots. Most doctors just tell you to suck it up, buttercup, this is your life now. Maybe see if the doctor will sign off on a CGM like the Libre. Libres aren’t too much out of pocket monthly ($75 for 2 sensors at Meijer, the reader is around $50) so you wouldn’t have to go through insurance preapproval since time is of the essence here.
