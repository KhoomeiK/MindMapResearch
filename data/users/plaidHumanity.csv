Gun sport is stupid. Every four years we are introduced to a litany of new sports in the Olympics. Most of these new sports are stupid. Guns for sport are similarly stupid. 

Pest control with guns is stupid. Bait and trap, move or drown. Going after pests with a gun is stupid. 

Carrying a gun for use as self defense is stupid. 46 years old, and there is not one case in my life where I was unable to defend myself because I didn't have a gun. My father and mother are each 76. Wife is 48. Brother, 44. That's a combined 450+ years of existence with no gun needed for defense. Dragging around heavy, armed steel for 450 years is stupid."

After 24 hr, use a fork or sth and now pull all those old, super clean carts out.

Take your glass of Everclear/cartgoop mix and place the entire bowl inside a pot with like an inch or less of water. Turn up the heat, but don't start a boil. Stir the mix until all the alcohol has evaporated. Be careful, don't use a gas/open flame stove. You could also just let it sit out for a few days until the alcohol has evapped out.

Take your reduced cartgoop and now throw a stick of butter in there. Heat and mix. 

Take your cannabutter and make a batch of gluten free cookies. 

Give your low-tolerance friend a cookie, take him to a show, watch him become immobile, worry it was the one little shroom he ate, then realize together...IT WAS THE COOKIE!"
