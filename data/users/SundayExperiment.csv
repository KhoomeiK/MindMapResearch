pcgaming,ffjchi7,t1_ffiyi3v,1579995393.0,"I haven't used it for gaming specifically, just for backing up files. For better performance an SSD drive for gaming would be the best bet overall, though size and all would depend on your budget. I'm currently upgrading to a new system with an NVMe 512gb SSD for boot and programs, and using a 960gb Sandisk SSD I got on sale a while back for games."
pcgaming,ffiw9wx,t1_ffisxan,1579984241.0,"I have 2x external 3.5"" 4TB Seagate Barracuda 5200's which I use for my back ups which have lasted me quite some time now with no hiccups yet which I got for a pretty good deal. 

Newegg has the 2tb Barracuda 7200's for about $40-$60 which personally I think is quite a good drive. We use the Barracudas often at work to backup all of our video projects, haven't had any of them fail yet."
pcgaming,ffimy1u,t1_ffiix1n,1579977734.0,"I would suggest using an SSD for boot still, and to store your programs which you use. A second internal drive specifically for games, and either another internal drive for backups, pictures, etc things that you are storing.

A 7200rpm drive should be sufficient for games and backup storage. Something between 1-2TB for the gaming drive (pending how many you store really) and another 2-4tb drive for backups and your etcetera storage. 

For anything of value to you (pictures/videos/etc.) it is recommended to have 2 back ups of at minimum. 

Do you have a rough budget in mind for your media?"
cinematography,ffdwu58,t1_ffcro10,1579830900.0,Mind saying which video tap you used? We have a Sony one at work which isn't doing so good.

NHLStreams,fepmzy2,t3_epzc9r,1579324839.0,Thanks mods for having a strategy before it got shut down. I remember a while ago there was a thread about this sub when the NBA streams sub abruptly shutdown with no back up plan.

It is currently -30 here today. I work indoors and only see the sun on the days is out during my drive to work, it can get pretty depressing honestly."

canucks,fchvanb,t1_fchqmf4,1577654565.0,That's exactly what I was thinking. I don't know why its always our tradition of having our goalies making us look better than we are. I think Naslund said the same thing of Luongo.
