I was experimenting with Empyrean Diona recently since her traps are Empyrean, and they actually count towards the Army once added. So you can only run 4 Emp cards (in my case 2 are Caleth) and by first perk they get their buff. (this also works with Burn the Bridges) Only issue with my iteration is that, apparently, Living Statue kicks Caleths ass.

I've also considered a Frenzy Bridge Shrine build based on only running Calethx2 and BS and waiting until perk 3 to gain taunt, but I don't really care for Bridge Shrine so I haven't ran it

But if IDK what you have then IDK what to suggest. Screaming Scrat, Morgrul, Bridge Buds are all good overall crafts.

Elf deck (aka Border Control deck) got hard nerfed, need to wait and see how it shakes out.

Demon warrior cycle is usually Volco, but I saw a Milloween variant that struck me as interesting. Basically you have 3 ""expensive"" Answer cards, DW, and the rest of the deck is 1-2 drops. Maybe a 3drop or two. Try to hold Volcos bridge for chip damage throughout the game while you build up your DW.

Slither: Depends on if its a Summons deck or not. Slithering Summons effectively turns Call Slitherbound into mana. You don't want the whole deck to be slither, in fact if it doesn't have CS its best to avoid them if you can (big exception being Stun Lancers). It runs on the basic Defense > Counterattack principle but uses Summons to get value. Run 2 Summons and make sure you have Snek Druid and Ahmun. Musketeer is... iffy. 

I don't think basic Slither is really that good, but combining Ahmun and the Slitherbound card is pretty good. You don't even need a slither deck if you have that combo, if Ahmuns call goes on Slitherbound its a 2 mana second life. He still dies to Beam tho... Once again you don't need the entire deck to be slither, if you have 3 nonslither cards slitherbound will always have a target

Apep miracle is basically about your flexibility. You need to know how to make something from some occasionally weird pulls. I have no clue how people run it in solos, not having a teammate to cover you when you play your investments seems suicidal. I guess they wait until they've done a successful defense... And you won't always get something useful. Once again having a teammate to be your anchor seems really important."

MinionMasters,feoh6st,t3_eppzko,1579300050.0,"It's a spellbait deck. Basically you just outnumber their counters with Thelecs and Last Stand. The deck has 2 phases:

Thelec waves: Get at least 2 together and play them one after the other. Hang on to the power boost for as long as possible. One or two will be soft countered, but they still have to deal with Telec himself and then there are more coming in behind him. Unless its a fast cycle deck with 2 spells they can't. Maybe squeeze a beam or a LS in there. 

Defend with a 7 (tanking with face), then counter with a 7 and RoS. That's a 21 mana counterpush they hhave to deal with. 

Keep in mind the deck only really works in solos since in Duos you have twice as many cycles and twice as many potential counters. It's still relatively easy to play around and"
MinionMasters,feoexgo,t3_eplix1,1579299136.0,His effect is questionable in solos too... seems buggy
MinionMasters,feodytn,t3_eq44qy,1579298781.0,"The entire concept of the card has a gaping flaw: If it can only be used on minions that are on the field, theres no element of surprise at all. His granted Stealth has only 2 uses: preventing any demon from being locked onto by ranged units (if they're already locked they keep them from stealthing period) and ensuring Rammer gets a free hit on A building.

It needs to go to cards in the hand. Maybe lose the class restriction. If it stifled/replaced the cards battle cry it would be really good for mind games

It also has the problem of being a 6 cost combo card. What does it combo with? Look at the roster of what voidbornes it can affect, what cards cost less than 6 mana that it can potentially combo with?"

MinionMasters,fedmthn,t3_eoibbs,1579015360.0,"It's kinda not anymore. Pretty much the only good RoS deck is triple Thelec in solos, and TBH I think it would be better with faster cycle and better support. But it's a good excuse to use RoS so thats what people are doing.

8 is bad if you aren't running triple Future Present. No anti-air besides Thelec, Twins, and Ahmun. And the only spell above cost 8 is Future present, so you can't run Twins. Also since its the only spell you can't proc Thelecs girls without it either.

7 is the 'best' option containing a lot of options, and just enough spells to run triThelec. 7 seems to have a big power gap over 6, fewer but higher quality summons. Basically what I'm saying is 7 mana has more than 1 mana over 6. 

\-Currently the best RoS deck is RoS, 3x Thelec, Howling Moon(FP for budget), Beam, Last Stand, Bahra, and 2 other 7 drop units. Spam waves of Thelecs, maybe using a Beam at some point. Defend with a 7 drop unit (preferably Moon) then follow up with another 7 drop and an RoS minion to try to force as much mana down your opponents throat at once.

6 is something not a lot of people run, you get more RoS casts per game, but it's a bit weaker. A lot of 6 drops actually have synergy requirements, R Prowler, Caber Tosser, Border Patrol... Also Styxi, Cleaver, Rock Rival (no statue), AtG drone, and Wolf Among Sheep are your options. Almost all requiring significant support of some kind.
