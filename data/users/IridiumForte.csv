If you have an eating disorder, you have an eating disorder.

AskReddit,fclkvxm,t1_fclkg58,1577750166.0,"Okay, I'm a bit confused (maybe end of my shift and I'm tired) but I'm just gonna throw out the general answer to the vibe I'm getting. The quick answer is I can't answer your questions because I don't know the hypothetical starting weight of the person in the example, but generally you lose weight mainly by eating less calories. So if that metric changes, that'll change results.

I have many days where I only eat a burger or two, in one meal. There are plenty of variables for weight loss, how many calories are in each burger and how much you weigh currently and whatever your caloric maintenance level is.

I'm lazy, and know that my caloric maintenance is much higher than 1-2 or even 3 burgers every day. So I lose weight, rapidly. If someone weighed 150lbs vs someone who weighed 300lbs they'd have to eat a different amount of burgers to hit their daily goal.

But, a part of what I'm trying to say is that it's not like I'm only eating burgers and that's the only lifestyle change I've adopted. Of course on keto I don't eat any/very little carbs, but I also do intermittent fasting (only eat between 7pm-10pm daily) and do the occasional extended water fast, just to completely negate incoming calories for 3-4 days at a time.

But. I eat a tonne of burgers as my main convenience meal."

Because you've put on weight by contrast from when you were hotter, you feel like your husband could get better women and that he deserves it, which is crossing wires with your sexual attraction to him. 

I suggest ultimately that you talk to your husband about how you're feeling, mostly in regard to your depression (which may contributing to feeling like you don't have much energy during the day) and general jealousy, as well as see a therapist so that you can get some legit advice and work through understanding why you're experiencing this.
