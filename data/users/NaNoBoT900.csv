science,ff70jzq,t1_ff705s3,1579638701.0,Better than nothing. I would read terrible books while I was locked up just to pass the time. Granted it wasn’t isolation. But still.
science,ff70ibk,t1_ff6yrgm,1579638675.0,Not sure. Think it depends. And who you know in there. If a CO is cool with you I’m sure they’d hook you up with stuff.
science,ff6wulh,t1_ff6uri7,1579636528.0,Sure but it still destroys the psyche being isolated like that.

pigs,fe5rtgk,t3_enr1kf,1578873624.0,"Unless it was *extremely* cold I don’t think she died of cold. It takes **very** cold weather for an extended period of time to kill a person or a pig. Pigs are very hardy and can take extremes in weather. They might not be comfortable but I find it highly unlikely one night of cold could’ve killed her, unless you’re in northern Canada or something. And even then I would be shocked. 

It’s very sad, but it’s not your fault."

stopdrinking,fcahrlg,t3_egskzs,1577569466.0,"This is always the worst emotion for me. I feel so much shame when I struggle because I know better. In a strange way though, feeling shame should be a point of pride. It means you care about yourself and those around you."
Advice,fcagfyp,t3_egmm6z,1577568795.0,"You have to talk to him about it. I’m an alcoholic and attend AA regularly. One of the things that hits closest to home is when family (especially children) says they are hurt by one’s consumption of alcohol. 

Be careful though, as this can backfire if he’s actually an addict and in denial. If he’s an addict he might lash out because he doesn’t want to accept anything that comes between him and alcohol. 

Talk to your mom, as others have said. Express your concern. Maybe you guys can get together and talk to him about it in a calm environment. 

Good luck to you, I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have."

I’m sciency too. I’m a professional engineer and love astrophysics. 

I always said my higher power is the universe. But that always felt cold and indifferent. I like gravity. Everybody feels it and is affected, even neutrons.

AMA,fbtgquq,t1_fbtf9xg,1577078304.0,Ah yes. When I first started looking at Forex markets the dollar would actually react to things he said. I think people started to realize it was bs though. His tweets seemingly affect the dollar much less now than even a year ago.
