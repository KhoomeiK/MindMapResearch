It would push back every other tournament on the calendar, angering players who would be expected to be in two places at once and don’t get anything if they can’t play. It would anger fans who bought tickets for certain days and would want refunds. Most importantly it would piss off the dozens of sponsors who sunk millions into the tournament and got a lot of advertising perks in exchange.
