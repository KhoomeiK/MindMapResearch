I play the piano, well I‚Äôve been playing it for the past 15 years or so tbh, and everytime my fingers touch the keys it feels like it‚Äôs for the very first time, and that‚Äôs what I really like about it. Done learning a new song? Switch to another one! It‚Äôs impossible to get bored.

What I also like about it is the endless number of note combinations. I get surprised how I‚Äôve never heard a certain combination - ‚Äúmelody‚Äù in all these years I‚Äôve been playing the piano. It truly feels ‚Äúmagical‚Äù, no other word can describe the feeling better."

I‚Äôm not ignoring the random moments when cats go full nuts and attack everything, but it‚Äôs just the way they are."

CasualConversation,fd5w7wr,t3_ek4akg,1578182280.0,"My grandma is Turkish, but she passed away long before she could teach me the language. So if you‚Äôre asking me why I‚Äôm learning it, I‚Äôd tell you because it‚Äôs the only way I would feel connected to her someway. I can still remember her voice, but she used to speak Turkish so little and I was too young to understand any of it. Besides, I‚Äôve already visited Turkey and I loved it, mostly its beautiful history.

I already know English, French and Arabic so this is my 4th language and honestly it‚Äôs becoming really complicated. I mix up words from these 4 languages so bad lol. But I won‚Äôt give up."
