grandorder,ffaxwxx,t3_erna6s,1579747049.0,"There's so much from WWII asking to be abused. Hell, you could make a Holy Grail War just with WWII characters. One example that's floated about in my head for a while is Raisa Aronova, a Support-focused Assassin. Her kit could have skills such as: 1) target-able skill to reduce the effect of debuffs (Emulating her ability to help during the chaotic and often blind Night Navigation in the war),  2) Personal Survivability in the form of hard defense, referencing her quick return to the skies after taking wounds from a anti-aircraft shell, and 3) A party-wide 5-15% NP gain up with a small Star Gen increase, emulating her ability to motivate and her deeds being able to improve morale during the war. NP is a 2-turn party-wide 30% Quick Up that also deals a light amount of AOE damage to the entire enemy party. Battle animations would be alterations of her utilizing rifles for her time Sharpshooting before the War, with her NP showing her riding off in a WWII-era Soviet Bomber. She could basically be the 3* Skadi/Osakehbime Quick support like how Hans is 2* Merlin/Waver.

Of course, just touching anything in the 20th century or on is a big if, or an outright no, for the fate franchise as a whole. Couple that with Russia and Japan not being great friends in the past (especially during this era). Then add to it the potential negative ramifications of having a recent servant depicted and there's the risk of surviving family wanting to cash in and people in the Russian Government not being happy about how a hero of theirs may or may not be depicted. Ugh. What a potential mess."

grandorder,ffatwzp,t3_erisff,1579744399.0,"For F2Ps and beginners, MLB Dragon's Meridian feels like a gamechanger and makes some servants that you'd never think about getting a NP with suddenly feel way different."
grandorder,ffasuf9,t3_es5c8d,1579743691.0,"Kid Gil. He was one of the first servants I got in the game and he was part of my main team which dragged me through the first 6 chapters and even saw a bit of use in Bablyonia.

But now I have a much larger roster and I realize he's not quite as good, even as he sits at 8/8/8 NP5 for me right now. Charm seems to have gradually been phased out of use simply by enemies either constantly being mental debuff immune or not meeting the parameters for it to hit (coupled with it under normal circumstance not being a guarntee hit anyway). His NP Gain Up feels a bit lacking, like it's obviously a step in the right direction but it often won't change anything that massively unless his Arts cards are at the end of a 3-card Arts chain. Credit where Credit is due, his party-wide Attack up can come clutch though.

My biggest issue is probably his lack of survivability coupled with just not having much kick behind his NP. Yeah, he's a three-star and comparing him to Kiyohime (who has the Berserker Class advantage and her stats are skewed towards her NP) and Adult Gilgamesh (Some of the best 5* stats in the game) is a loosing battle. But it just feels really underwhelming. As an AoE NP it doesn't do enough damage to anything with health on the third wave. If all the damage was consolidated to just one target it might not be so bad (but he'd still be outclassed by Kuro and San(ta) the Hun, not to mention Medea's NP spam) but as it is now it just isn't enough. And again, that might not be an issue if he could naturally stick around long enough to try and charge it up again, but he has NO active or passive defense, let alone any sort of heal that can keep him around a bit longer. He really only gets to shine at my Chaldea when combined with Mash and Merlin because they can keep him around, help charge his NP with Arts cards, and Merlin can Hyper-Power his buster cards. But Diversity is the spice of life and I don't like just slapping Mash-Merlin on everyone for everything. Kid Gil is a good Jack-Of-All-Trades except survivability, but masters none of them.

Stepping outside of my Chaldea: 

5* Artoria Lancer feels like a higher HP and higher ATK version of my 4* Artoria Lancer, but with a less impressive kit. Actually, every Artoria that isn't Maid, Swimsuit, or the 4* Lancer feels really underwhelming and poorly put together.

Berserker Lancelot has the same deck setup as Tamacat but his kit seems so danm focused on getting his NP spat out to generate a bunch of stars (which doesn't seem to charge that quickly in my experience) and doesn't have the longevity that Cat does. Sure, Skadi memes will save him but my thoughts on a Servant really only being able to shine with a Skadi/Tamamo/Merlin support is that the servant must not be that great to begin with.

The Foreigner Class in general seems like a cool idea but with good-not-great execution because of the way classes are mapped out. Abigail and Hokusai are fun to use but this class feels like Pokemon's Dragon Type in the first two gens, too niche to get any serious use except against one type (that isn't too hard to deal with normally) and itself."
grandorder,ffaqrb7,t3_erzobn,1579742290.0,"Penth, who I'll be grabbing with the 4* ticket. She's top priority.

Medusa gets second priority. She's been in my Chaldea almost since I started playing the game but I've never used her. She's hovering at about lvl 60 right now, so pushing her to 70 shouldn't be too hard.

Not sure if Shota Alexander, Stheno, or Jailbait Jalter should get priority after that. All three are sitting in my second archive and while all three have my passing interest none of them have enough interest for me to start going sucko mode and try to raise them. If it comes down to it Jailbait Jalter will probably get the pick because the only other Lancer I have is Lartoria Alter.

Of course, real 2nd priority will be Ushiwakamaru if she turns up again. I had her several months back but ran out of space, and kicked her out of Chaldea because A) Not interested in Quick-focused servants and B) Already had Martha and Ishtar Summer coupled with untouched Medea and Shota Alexander. Hadn't gotten to Babylonia yet so my exposure to her was quite limited, and I foolishly kicked her out. I'd love to have her turn up again and give her the care she deserves."

AskReddit,fdcvrue,t3_ekjbja,1578285727.0,"Video Gaming.

The requirements for me to 'get good' in a game are dozens upon dozens of hours spent in a week, week in and week out. (I'm 24 by the way, no spring chicken but far from an old man). My experience with Multi-player games with any competitive bent is horrendous, I'm the guy who goes 0-27 in a round of Battlefield 1 and could not figure out what was going on the entire time. For single-player games I frequently rage out or just give up. The main reason is Difficulty curves are far beyond anything I can reasonable adjust to. For example, Borderlands 2 was fun for the first 10 hours and then I found myself completely depleted of all ammo and getting one-shotted by any enemy in the game. Code Vein was a blast for the opening tutorial and then became hell after the first boss as every enemy encounter required picture-perfect timing and accuracy because two or three hits equaled death (Then again I personally think the Soulsbourne Gameplay style is bullshit anyway, so maybe my opinion here doesn't matter). And if you want someone to help pad your stats on a fighting game hit me up, I can guarantee that even the shittiest button masher will never drop below half a bar of health.

My gaming right now focuses only on Forza 7 (which is the only game I do spend dozens of hours on to stay competitive) GTA V and Minecraft. The latter two only because I can set myself to a mindless repetitive task of moving goods or digging tunnels. The only games outside of those I've ever been able to play and enjoy are Classic Survival Horror (RE, Silent Hill, Fatal Frame) because I'm so intimately familiar with that style of gameplay, and the Metal Gear Solid franchise because it's so slow and methodical that it just clicks.

It also doesn't help that I rage out very violently if I feel I've been wronged by an unfair game, though I've gotten better at that by learning to just give up before I break the bones in my hand or something valuable."

Indy 500 Champ: Takuma Sato. The aeroscreen will add more drag to the cars, making the race feel more like the events between 2012 and 2017 rather then the last two years. Penske will be strong but simply won't be strong enough.

Indycar Champion: Newgaden. Andretti will continue to fall behind from being spread to thin and Dixon will begin to regress. RLL will have a darkhorse team gunning for the championship but simply won't have the consistency. Power will be hindered by poor luck and Pags will fall back to his 2017 performance.

Rookie of the Year: Oliver Askew. Won't do anything impressive because of team issues, but simply by having a more stable team then the other two rookies (Veekay with Ed Carpenter being no good on road courses, Palou at Dale Coyne not being able to capitalize on the brainpower that had been with the team in prior years) he'll back into it.

Biggest Surprise: Takuma Sato has the biggest year of his career, stealing multiple wins and being a darkhorse championship contender, only loosing out because consistency and overdriving the car sells him short. Graham Rahal also takes a step forward.

Biggest Disappointment: SPAM. The team won't mesh well with each other, not having an experienced veteran driving the car will hurt their ability to get results, and both of their full-time drivers and teams will be thrown to the wayside in favor of supporting Alonso during the 500, leaving some bitter feelings in the team. They'll get a victory at Toronto and maybe one other place, but outside of that they'll be a consistent mid-pack team. Bonus hot Take: James Hinchcliffe gets a ride for the 500 and fails to qualify in it, permanently ending his Indycar career.

Biggest Change for 2021: I'll give you four.

1). Modifications to the HALOscreen will come about. Nothing massive to the casual viewer, but the dimensions will shift and new cooling elements will need to be put in place for the next season after drivers experience issues with minor dehydration and heat exhaustion at the 500 and Texas. Key word being minor, I'm not expecting injuries or race-retirements from it.

2). The Hybrid regs for 2022 will be fleshed out. A third OEM will state their interest but will not be wiling/able to join in 2022, so in an agreement the regs get pushed back into 2023 and we will have three Engine Manufacturers that year. With that said, Penske and Indycar will fall short of getting a fourth manufacturer.

3). Montreal, Surfer's Paradise, Pocono. Two of these three circuits will be added back to the 2021 schedule.

4). Foyt's team is forced to contract to a single car, being a revolving door for ride buyers."
