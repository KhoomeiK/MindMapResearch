autoimmunity,ffapahc,t1_ffa4xps,1579741305.0,"I saw an MD who was also a functional medicine specialist. She had me do the SIBO test, and we sorted the candida by seeing if I responded to treatment. I couldn't take the pharmaceuticals for SIBO so I've done a whole mix of things, but mostly diet (AIP) and natural antibacterials/antifungals like Allicin (from Garlic, I use the brand Allimax) and Oregano. Getting diagnosed and treated changed my life. If you think you have one or both of these, a functional med specialist is the most likely to be able to diagnose. I recommend looking for someone who is also an MD or MD-adjacent (like a NP or PA)."

I‚Äôve used the Apple Pencil with my iPad Pro and the Notability app and I really like it. I love that a new page appears when you need one and that you can zoom in as much as you want, so you can make really detailed mind maps. But it has a completely different feel to pen and paper, so... I think this is a try-it-and-see kind of thing. You might find it‚Äôs for you, or you might hate it.

ETA: If by digital apps you mean apps where you type or mind mapping apps, they are pretty different. You don‚Äôt get the retention benefits of handwriting. They can absolutely work, but it‚Äôs not the same at all."

autoimmunity,ff6eoc2,t3_ervk9b,1579625558.0,"I have a lot of these symptoms as well. My diagnoses are RA, FM, and SIBO/Candida (aka gut flora imbalance). I have suspected EDS but I haven‚Äôt gone down the road of trying to get formal diagnosis. 

As a lot of autoimmune stuff overlaps, you may or may not have the same diagnoses as me. But I can tell you that when my gut doing better, the rest of me is feeling better. And it makes sense as a lot of the immune system is dependent on a healthy digestive tract. So that‚Äôs the place I‚Äôd recommend starting‚Äîsee if you can get those issues sorted, either through diet (AIP) or other means."
rheumatoid,ff524nm,t3_erjxcy,1579578165.0,"Yes. It‚Äôs my understanding that there‚Äôs a pretty direct connection between the gut and the immune system (a lot of the immune system is in the intestines). I expect that if I can resolve my gut imbalances, my autoimmune stuff will effectively go away."

I know with complete confidence that it would not help me. Eating grains and starchy veggies cause me to flair. Coconut oil does not cause me to flair. The best way for me to clear a flair is to avoid grains entirely. 

Like the other commenter, I have digestive issues. Mine are linked to my autoimmune disorder. The healthier my digestive system is, the less pain I have. I suspect this is true for a lot of us, even those of us that don‚Äôt have any digestive symptoms (a lack of symptoms doesn‚Äôt mean complete health). 

There‚Äôs a lot of conflicting information out there. I‚Äôve read articles on how going vegan can fix all kinds of health issues, and articles from people who talk about how sick it made them and once they switched to a paleo-style diet they recovered to full health. What that tells me is that everyone is different. Certain things, like sugar, are going to be inflammatory for everyone, but beyond that...you just need to listen to your body and what it‚Äôs telling you."

The one I‚Äôve been using lately is ‚ÄúI am capable.‚Äù But you can use anything that you need to remind (or convince) yourself of. Basically I end the entry with those words, and if I get that doubting voice in my head when I write it, I write down what the voice says (no, you‚Äôre not, etc.) and then journal about why it‚Äôs wrong. Sometimes I start with the affirmation if I don‚Äôt know what else to write, and see what comes up once those words are on the page. I‚Äôm pretty new to this, but I‚Äôve been playing with this for the last few weeks (I journal daily, no matter what), and I definitely feel like I believe those words a lot more than I did a few weeks ago.

And she helped me get it sorted‚Äîover the course of years‚Äîand never let me feel like I was alone.

bulletjournal,feo1qs6,t1_feo0hm9,1579293980.0,"Next to none. I do something close to Ryder Carroll‚Äôs original system, except I don‚Äôt do any future planning (I keep my calendar on my phone and transfer appointments to my dailies). For my corporate job I do this in an A5 Moleskine grid notebook with whatever pens I have around. For my personal bujo I use a Hobonichi A6 Avec (which is a planner) and a Hobonichi A6 notebook in the same cover. I do my bujo dailies in the daily pages of the planner, which saves me time as I don‚Äôt even need to write in the dates, and I keep my collections and master lists in the notebook.

I could, theoretically, go back and doodle in the open space on the pages in the Hobonichi, but I haven‚Äôt done that because I just don‚Äôt have the time."

BasicBulletJournals,femta34,t1_fems3dl,1579268981.0,"I think where it‚Äôs ambiguous you do kind of just need to make your own decision on what works for you.

In my current practice I use > for anything I migrate regardless of where it‚Äôs going, but I do like the idea of using an indicator of where the task winds up."
rheumatoid,femscl3,t3_epwrzh,1579268225.0,"It‚Äôs my personal experience that doctors across the board often fail to diagnose or give diagnoses like ‚ÄúIBS‚Äù where they‚Äôre simply acknowledging that you have a collection of symptoms but don‚Äôt have a root cause for those symptoms. I‚Äôve been to docs all my life who, when I tell them what I‚Äôm experiencing, if they don‚Äôt have a magic pill, they ignore it. Heck, this happened in December‚ÄîI went to my doctor with a long list of thyroid symptoms. Doc ran a TSH test, it came back normal. She never reached out to talk to me about what else might be causing my symptoms. No follow-up whatsoever.

If it doesn‚Äôt need to be done right away, moving it to the monthly list for later scheduling is appropriate. The idea is that the task goes somewhere you‚Äôll see it again, and doesn‚Äôt just sit in your dailies and get forgotten about. 

So say you need to call Sue about a job offer, and you need to do it really soon, so you put it in your daily. But the day gets away from you and now it‚Äôs after 5 and you can‚Äôt call Sue until tomorrow. You‚Äôd move it to tomorrow‚Äôs daily. You also need to organize your closet, so you jot that in your daily. You don‚Äôt get to it because you have higher priorities, but the closet org is still important, you really do want to make time for it. But maybe not tomorrow, because tomorrow is super busy, and it can wait for the weekend. So you migrate it to the monthly list."

Is your criticism overly harsh? If the answer is no, your criticism is correct, brainstorm actions you can do to change your behavior going forward that you can put into play right away.

AutoImmuneProtocol,fe5uic4,t3_enuh7o,1578875241.0,"It might be that you‚Äôve gradually reduced your inflammation over time to the point where you‚Äôre seeing less overall. When I‚Äôm super inflamed, literally every meal will make me worse, to the point where I‚Äôd rather starve than eat (starving does not decrease inflammation, so, not a good plan). But once I get my inflammation down, I only get inflamed with trigger foods. If this is what‚Äôs happened, good job!"

bulletjournal,fe4abdq,t3_enqu3z,1578857301.0,"Looks like a bullet journal to me. FWIW Ryder Carroll, the creator of the system, says that if you call it a bullet journal then it is one. The system is supposed to be flexible and customizable and lots of folks use the bullet journal system in planners."
Journaling,fe2s4n2,t3_ennby8,1578842297.0,"It gets everything out of your head so you organize it all (or just so you can think, LOL). I get a definite sense of peace from writing down everything floating in my head, and it helps me to see what I need to get done and find the most efficient way to do it all."

fountainpens,fe2fs7g,t3_enlsfx,1578837886.0,"I grew up in the US and was in school in the 80s and 90s. I was taught to write with pencil and used ballpoint pens when I got older. I didn‚Äôt know anyone in school with a fountain pen. 

I‚Äôm fascinated that fountain pens are required in schools elsewhere."

hobonichi,fe2e4b5,t1_fe20lyb,1578837335.0,This reddit won‚Äôt gain any traction by telling people to go elsewhere.
hobonichi,fe2dbot,t3_enlt11,1578837144.0,"I really like technical fineliners like the Pigma Microns or the Copic Multiliners. They‚Äôre permanent and archival and don‚Äôt leave indents in the paper. I use the 01 Micron for most of the stuff in my planner (the Hobonichi techo A6). It dries super fast, plays nice with stencils, comes in several colors for color-coding, etc. 

For journaling, (in a Cafe Note B6, which has the same paper as a Hobonichi) I use Pilot Kakuno F and TWSBI Eco EF fountain pens. I use several inks that all dry fast enough for me as a left-handed overwriter, but I use blotting paper as a protector anyway to be on the safe side. Right now I have the following inks in my pens:

Robert Oster Fire and Ice

Robert Oster Great Southern Ocean

Monteverde Blueberry Muffin

Colorverse Delicious Sleep

Colorverse Coffee Break

Pilot Iroshizuku Tsutsuji

DeAtramentis Document Black

DeAtramentis Document Fuchsia

Be warned about the DeAtramentis inks - they stain everything. They will absolutely stain whatever pen you put them in. I keep them in Kakunos because they‚Äôre $13 each so I‚Äôm not super worried if the ink ruins them. But the inks are permanent and archival and dry really fast for FP ink, so, if you need a permanent ink, they‚Äôre a way to go. They can also be blended to make custom colors. That said, I prefer my non-waterproof inks and just don‚Äôt get my journal wet. 

I also use brush pens and watercolors in my Hobonichis. I don‚Äôt use gel pens, despite them being my favorite for cheaper paper, because they do smear. 

The Jetstream ink (the Hobonichi pen) is excellent and doesn‚Äôt smear at all, so that‚Äôs a good choice too."
Journaling,fe28j9o,t3_enmak5,1578835601.0,I speak in general but I don‚Äôt share specifics and would not show someone my journal.
fountainpens,fe27v67,t1_fe1yymz,1578835451.0,You can also fill the converter this way. I use the disposable eyedroppers from Goulet to do it.
