Fantasy,fezx8m3,t3_er0wkf,1579462864.0,I'd love to have a bunch of short stories about Nobby Nobbs and his misadventures
Fantasy,feyoo50,t3_equab2,1579448408.0,"I really loved this one, its definitely worth 4 dollars"
MorbidReality,fev98yf,t1_feu8ajd,1579394644.0,Her father was absolutely disgusting.
Fantasy,feud76n,t1_feubwjs,1579385427.0,Like nails on a chalkboard
Fantasy,feu0v8t,t3_eqlndx,1579382035.0,"Lol, not as much as the pronunciation the narrator gives. Dont get me wrong, I ADORE steven pacey, but the one nitpick I have is that he pronounces it grim-Aced. *shudder*"
Fantasy,fetme3e,t1_fetl9kn,1579376838.0,"Right? I read at minimum 50 books a year, sometimes up and over 200. This battle still stands as one of the best battle scenes I've ever read. Creative, unique, and impactful"
Fantasy,fetl2lf,t3_eqkw6o,1579376438.0,"Alternating very different genres can help stave off burnouts. I love switching between sci fi, non fiction, and fantasy to keep things fresh. It also helps when I round back to fantasy to read a different subgenres. Epic fantasy can get exhausting because they can be intense and detailed. Throwing in a comedy or an urban fantasy helps a lot. 

Some of my fav books that arent high epic fantasies that are lighter and quicker 

* hero forged by josh erikson
* where the waters turn black by benedict patrick 
* small gods by Terry pratchett 
* nice dragons finish last by rachel aaron
* the half killed by quenby Olson"
Fantasy,fete82o,t3_eqjvgi,1579374489.0,"The Heroes by Joe Abercrombie has one of the most memorable battle scenes I've ever read, its stuck with me for years. The perspectives keep switching as they die in battle."
Fantasy,feh8thj,t3_ep5fpq,1579111527.0,"I think that **Never Die** by *Rob J Hayes* might be what you're looking for. There's a creepy as fuck little kid who goes around finding dead heroes, bringing them back to life, and binding them to him so they have to carry out his mission to kill the Emperor or die for a second time, which would be permanent. There's a great audiobook that accompanies it and it's a current finalist in SPFBO"
aww,feek0rd,t1_feeiwha,1579035313.0,It's such an unnecessary risk not being honest...hopefully they change their mind before the kid finds out for themself.
Fantasy,feeiu3d,t3_eoqxf7,1579034626.0,They are a breath of fresh air because they are so unique - they work great as palate cleansers. I would agree with the general consensus that the series gets better as the books progress. That's pretty typical though as a new author finds their voice and style. Each book stands alone so you can start with whatever blurb grips you most
aww,feeh7v3,t1_fee9yh1,1579033694.0,"Also adopted... they dont need to know they were a child born from rape, but if they find out later they were adopted and no one told them there could be huge resentment. I'd be pissed for a long time, personally. I was told before I could even really understand and it wasnt ever a big deal."
DunderMifflin,fdt3ole,t3_emz3xc,1578711504.0,I hope you were there just for the smell of it
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fdrjtmp,t3_empm95,1578685557.0,"There's a series called Yarnsworld written by Benedict Patrick that are beautiful and unique. Each book is its own stand alone story in the same universe and they're all very, very different. There's one about a girl who lives on a series of Atolls and canoes from one place to the next. In Yarnsworld people have what's known as ""Knacks"" and they are just small mundane abilities that get enhanced. A music Knack, a fishing Knack, a cooking Knack etc. It's called Where the Waters Turn Black and it's one of my favorite books.

The kindle versions are cheap, but if you want to pony up for the physical edition the covers are stunning.

Fantasy,fdh34xk,t1_fdgrf9o,1578414362.0,"Um, somewhere between 10 and 50 pages, maybe twice. It wasnt bad and you may not notice it at all. Itll depend on how invested you are in certain plot points. Nothing to me felt like a slog, just a bit of a slow down. A slog is something I struggle through"

suggestmeabook,fdeww19,t1_fddzs0x,1578348298.0,"This is the one I was coming to recommend. It's been years since I read it and I still remember it vividly. It's such a strange, dark, fucked up book."
Fantasy,fdeijxu,t3_ekxw36,1578339776.0,"I didn't know the sequel was coming out so soon, that's pretty awesome because Gutter Prayer was one of my favorites from last year"
Fantasy,fdef2g4,t1_fde7iu9,1578337626.0,"I literally just posted a review here about Fortune's Fool, the first review I've posted in probably over half a year just because I loved it so much."
Fantasy,fdeevwl,t1_fdecjst,1578337514.0,"I was so nervous going into this. A single POV either really works or really doesn't. If I don't get behind the character that can be it, DNF'd. I'm super happy I loved this character so I just kept wanting to know more."
Fantasy,fdeest0,t1_fdee2zg,1578337460.0,"I think it's slightly shorter than Fortune's Fool, but not by a lot. I think it still is about 600 pages or so. Going into books blind is how I prefer to read the initial batch in phase 1 of SPFBO. I like knowing absolutely nothing and going in with a totally blank slate. I've been reading lots of reviews for the finalists before reading them myself, though. I'm not sure why I do it that way, but, eh :D"
Fantasy,fdeady7,t1_fde9h67,1578334697.0,That's another very slow burn with a big payoff that starts around 36% into it. I wasnt sure at first if I was going to like it but I ended up adoring it
Fantasy,fddxlr7,t3_ekutpb,1578326440.0,"* What other genre do you write in, and why the pen name? 
* I also have three dogs. What are there names and do you have pictures for pet tax? 
* what is the main responsibility of a military meteorologist? 
* I just put Rumble in my KU library"

WitchesVsPatriarchy,fcj4d8w,t1_fciyexk,1577676973.0,Reaper man is comfort food to me. I reread it almost every year around the anniversary of a family members death. It eases things just a bit

We gave him a second chance as married adults to be in our lives and he was only negative, manipulative, and abusive - just not physically anymore because the tables have turned as far as physical strength. Good riddance to shitty people."
