Comparing it to deaths from alcohol isn't really a good comparison; we can prevent most measles deaths by vaccinating.

The problem is that they're literally the worst adaptations imaginable. The plot you see in the movie *does not exist* in the books. 

There's point A, where Percy finds out he's a demigod, and there's point B, where he returns the bolt to Olympus. But the way the movie gets from point A to point B is *completely* different from the way the book does it. And it's not an improvement either. Some of the changes are completely nonsensical and take away a lot of what makes the story/characters amazing.

The Sea of Monsters adaptation is even worse - it does the same damn thing, but it also brings in plot points that shouldn't come up for another *two years* in-universe. Again, that's fine if it wasn't an adaptation, but in theory, it was. And it *sucks* as an adaptation. I genuinely don't think they could have made a worse adaptation if they'd tried.

>when a life-changing diagnosis is assigned without any medical evaluation, only by some phrases ""but I feel like that"", said by an undeveloped child.

Literally every mental diagnosis is based on ""I feel like x"". No one seems to complain about anything but gender dysphoria diagnoses. 

Therapists are trained to make those diagnoses. Psychologists have carefully hammered out the guidelines to say ""These are the criteria to reliably diagnose dysphoria."" Just because you think it's based only on ""some phrases"" doesn't mean that's how it actually works.

What's he got to do with it? Being trans isn't a paraphilia.

I'm not sure you understood what that was, nor am I certain what that has to do with the trans community. Pedophilia is a disorder, and people can benefit from medical treatment to manage it. Recognizing it in the DSM as a paraphilia is a step towards that.

>prescribing them to children just for being GNC is literal gay erasure.

There is a difference between being gender non-conforming and being trans, and it's pretty fucked up that you're trying to conflate them.

A gender non-conforming person still identifies as the gender they were assigned at birth. A trans person does not. That's the difference. Letting kids know both options are available and valid is important, but no, letting kids socially transition and potentially giving them blockers is not ""literal gay erasure.""

I agree kids are very impressionable, but there's a difference between what sounds like creating a false memory and maintaining a false identity for years. I don't know, I just don't buy that it could happen on a level high enough to justify blocking off valuable medical resources, you know?

I honestly don't know the answers. All I know is that being cruel to people and trying to force them to be something they aren't definitely isn't right, and I'm afraid this ""Rapid Onset gender Dysphoria"" thing will be used as a justification to do that.

insanepeoplefacebook,fe6gwg7,t1_fe6g55f,1578890534.0,">I feel like it's irresponsible to encourage young people to transition at any level past a social transition until their brain is fully developed.

So when they're 25? Or when they're adults? Because you can't stop adults from having medical procedures.

Good news, like I said, 16 is the earliest I've seen for hormones. Blockers can have side effects and aren't fully studied, but seem to be reversible and are worth it to protect mental health. And that's it beyond social transition until they're an adult.

I really just don't think it's plausible that a meaningful number of girls (or boys) pretend to be trans for attention. Trans people will tell you, it's *really* hard to be seen differently from the person you are inside. I highly doubt a cis kid would be able to keep up that facade for any length of time. And even if they are, therapy is an integral part of transition. A therapist can tease out any underlying problems and deal with them.

Given all the safeguards and how detrimental it can be to a trans kid to deny their identity, I just don't think you can really justify anything but accepting a kid where they are. If they feel safe and accepted, and get the mental health support that frankly, every kid should have, then they'll turn out fine regardless. If they don't, they'll be worse off even if it is ""fake"".

The surgeons and psychologists who study and aid transitions think that hormones and surgery are helpful enough to outweigh the risks. Trans people who have gender confirmation surgery report quality of life improvements. I don't know what else to tell you - I trust them. I trust that the people you linked to had bad experiences, and that shouldn't be ignored, but neither should the voices of those who've had great experiences.
