GetMotivated,fdcj8ma,t1_fdc2buo,1578276256.0,"Also the energy you put out into the world is what you receive. So, if you're constantly negative the people around you will mirror that energy. If you exude positivity, I find that also rubs off on people. I feel like I sound like a hippy, lol. But it's how I live my life and I'm a pretty happy, stress free person."
GetMotivated,fdcir0x,t1_fdc2buo,1578275914.0,"When something negative comes my way, I try to have the mindset that this shall pass and it's just a hiccup in my day. Whatever the situation, it may suck, but I guarantee the rest of my day was a pretty positive experience. Think about the positives of your day rather than dwelling on the negatives. Another big help has been setting up a rainy day fund, I try to put aside at least $10 a week for emergencies. Finances was my big stressors in the past. Knowing I have a backup to replace tires or small car repairs helps me have peace of mind too. So I guess that'd be good advice. Figure what your main stressors are and make a plan to reduce that stress in your life. Whether it's saving money or paying down debts. Other than that, I believe happiness is a choice. When you wake up to start your day, you choose to start on a positive or negative note."
GetMotivated,fd9795l,t3_ekb358,1578229434.0,"This was a New Years Resolution for me years ago. The amount of stress we put on ourselves daily and carry through the week is insane sometimes. Waking up and starting fresh every morning with the goal of just being positive has really turned things around for me and makes me realize what is most important to me in my life. Mistakes happen, get up brush yourself off, think how to not make it again, and keep on trucking."
AskReddit,fd92d2q,t3_ekc6zf,1578227324.0,That when I try to kill a spider it will attack me in some way. Like come at me with 8 tiny switch blades or just go straight for my jugular...my husband takes care of all spiders in our home.
AskReddit,fd91y2w,t3_ekc7cd,1578227078.0,"Had an ex boyfriend try to control my weight. He'd comment on my food portions and nake pig noises as I ate. He'd force/guilt me into running every day and follow me in his truck to make sure I was running and not walking. The ""moments"" for me was when I felt so ashamed that I'd eaten 3 leftover meatballs from the fridge that I cooked 3 to replace what I had eaten in hopes I wouldn't get caught. The last moment that made me leave was when he told to do 50 sit ups. I didn't want to so he pushed me down and refused to let me back up until I did them. I'm ashamed to say, it took me a year to finally see how controlling he was."
AskReddit,fd90ycc,t3_ekc7sd,1578226558.0,"Our friendship isn't as strong as it once was. The woman who her husband cheated on her with committed suicide and she posted some awful things on FB about it. It apalled me. I called her and told her so and we had a very honest conversation about it. She's not the same person I knew growing up, she's so negative all of the time. I've distanced myself from her and I'm not sure I want to remain friends in all honesty."

food,fciue5k,t1_fci2b48,1577670043.0,"Sure. It was pretty good as is, I think I'm going to experiment with some different veggies and quail eggs. Chicken eggs were okay, but they lacked the creaminess of quail eggs."
food,fchkfjq,t1_fchh5wm,1577651263.0,Thank you. First time and it tasted great. Will be experimenting further once I hit the asian market. Publix was limited on some ingredients.
AskReddit,fcasmco,t3_egxzih,1577575808.0,"Any small good deed. From holding a door open, paying for someone's coffee, or a genuine compliment. You can really make someone's day and everyone can use a little kindness in their life."
AskReddit,fcarxt9,t3_egxwi5,1577575439.0,"I had my first love cheat on me with a good friend. As far as carrying on, I remember taking very long walks and surrounding myself with friends and family. It still hurt but not being idle or alone helped me work through it, but I also stopped dating for a while and I never really opened myself up as fully so quickly after meeting someone. It took a while for me to truly trust people."
AskReddit,fc5sjia,t3_eetf7i,1577464903.0,"I ran away from home at 6 because I had watched Indiana Jones and wanted to go on a adventure too. I got into a car with a strange man, who thankfully was a nice guy, and he drove me to my grandmas. My parents showed up and I got my butt whooped. Had to go see a counselor and asked why I ran away, told her my brother and sister picked on me, a lie I thought would prevent me from getting into further trouble. So we all had to go to mandatory counseling for a year."
AskReddit,fc5rh99,t3_egd51l,1577464289.0,Phenomenon...because I absolutely can not say it correctly. My tongue twists with this one and every time I attempt it the hubby and I get a good laugh.

AskReddit,fc5po39,t3_egcr3u,1577463301.0,"My parents are both disabled and were about to lose their home due to taxes they couldn't afford. They asked me to borrow money, but I was living paycheck to paycheck and couldn't help. I was 21 at the time and a convenience store manager. My DM knew something was wrong and asked me what was wrong. We stepped outside and I just started bawling. I was so stressed out trying to help but knowing I couldn't. Two days later he came in with a check from the owner of the company. It was a loan, no interest attached. I accepted and paid my parents taxes. He absolutely did not need to do this, but truly cared about his people."
AskReddit,fc5o7ed,t3_egcs6e,1577462494.0,"I've got two tattoos, I only regret one. It was done in a spur of the moment. I got a tramp stamp on my way home from partying. It's ugly and I want it removed. I would say, if you get one or several, make sure each one is meaningful to you or you'll regret them later on. My first is a butterfly to honor my grandma, still love it. I want another, in remembrance of my father, but I'm still deciding on the best way to do so."
AskReddit,faiqw8j,t3_e9golj,1576114478.0,"Super strength, invulnerability, and flight. And I'd probably be an anti hero. I'm a good person but let's be honest, if you had all that power it'd be hard not to slip up."
