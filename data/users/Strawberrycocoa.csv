The rest of his hunting squad, not a one of them older than sixteen, remained safely behind the cover of trees and rocks. Waiting. Watching.

The Elder had been a man, once. As human as any of them, with normal skin and normal hair and a normal smile. According to legend, his name had been Sun Sin, and he had been a baker in his youth.

Gone was the bronzed skin tanned by the heat of years working over an oven. Now rocky plates covered Sun Sin's body, flaking scaley skin stretched tautly between them creaking as he moved. Gone was the mane of ravishing black hair that had once caught the eye of every girl in the village. Now a knotted furl of dirty blood-soaked fur ran down his back, along the length of his tail all the way to it's furiously whipping end. Gone was the welcoming smile that had once beckoned the village children in for a free sweet. Now rows of fangs ran haphazardly along his jaw, covered in blood and dripping gore.

Sun Sin's colossal scare-crow form hunched over his latest kill. Long lean arms tore hungrily into the guts of a rival Elder who had not won their battle. Fistfuls of dripping foul entrails were shoved into Sun Sin's eternally hungry maw. His eyes darted around as he ate, each eye moving independently, constantly scanning the surroundings. The heart of Sun Sin's prey was pierced upon one of his horns, a crown for the victor of their battle. The heart still beat. The fallen Elder thrashed in it's death throes as Sun Sin ate of it's warm steaming innards.

Tin Tang's hand went unconsciously to a spot on his arm. A small place that felt harder than the rest of his body, a little knot of mass under his skin. Tin Tang had always been bigger than the other kids. He was the first to grow tall, the first to grow hair on his lip. And in touching the spot on his arm, he knew he would be the first of his village to grow the armor of an Elder. 

Tin Tang thrust his hand forward silently, and the hunting squad swarmed from the treeline en masse, taking aim for Sun Sin before he could eat too much of the fallen Elder. The both of them would make good provisions for the winter."
