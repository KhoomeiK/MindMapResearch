I just put some air dry foam from the middle to end of my hair and then blow or air dry. It gives the ends more texture and an overall shape to the layers."
women,ffnsqjb,t1_ffnkysc,1580070291.0,"After years of being a waitress, this is very good advice. If you say anything to their lewd comment, you have now “started a conversation”. In many cases, this is exactly what they want because a) you are now engaging b) you are trapped in the situation since you are at work in a uniform. 

I used to giggle in my teenage years because it was so awkward I really thought, “they must be joking.” And it’s the easiest way to move on. But after giving it thought and talking about it to my dad and brothers, my best defense has become a stone-cold poker face. 

A relaxed face with eye contact and silence will say it all. Every performer hates silence. And that’s all he’s trying to do: perform. But you are living in reality. The reality needs to be you know how to protect yourself and you will always choose yourself over following social norms. 

Also, direct eye contact means, “I will remember you.” And if he lives in in the area and is a real creep, he will hate that. That’s how sex offenders get caught."
