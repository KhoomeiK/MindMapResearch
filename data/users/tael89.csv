instant_regret,ff3wnjh,t1_ff3non4,1579550469.0,That limit is when you have very high voltage levels to cause dielectric breakdown. Not something with household voltage. The insulation will limit the current that can pass through something. That resistance to the electrical potential (voltage) determines how much current will pass through. That resistance and voltage also let you calculate the power as well.

He had given you his phone and a conversation popped up with enough concerning information that warranted extra investigation. That extra information was required due to the nature of your partner -the deceit and lack of respect for you and your relationship.

witcher,feos5y6,t3_ed6wqz,1579304660.0,"I'm on my second watch of the series to digest it again; just watched this episode again and then slept and I realized some things.

The way they portrayed Geralt so desperately needing the djinn to sleep is so interesting to the parallels to the theme of destiny as part of the reasons he can't sleep. I've realized that it doesn't make sense to have a being more magically powerful than witches grant Geralt sleep. However, I believe it is he cannot sleep because he is trying to ignore his destiny. He's ignored his child of surprise for over a decade and it started weighing on him, which lies in line with consequences of him ignoring destiny."

mildlyinfuriating,febiawf,t1_fear0ao,1578959130.0,No problem. I think the next issue will be making sure we have the correct cables (kind of like we had with earlier usb cable).
mildlyinfuriating,feap5ai,t1_fealgei,1578950986.0,"Yeah it is using the usb-c format or shape. This question exemplifies all this is wrong with the standards right now. USB-C is just the shape of the ports. It can be designed with USB 3.0, 3.1 (GEN 1 or gen 2), it could even just support usb 2 superspeed. As an example, the OnePlus 6 phone has a usb-c port, but does not have usb 3.1 speeds. I believe it was just usb 2.0 but cannot recall specifically right now.

The next USB protocol (standards on what it does, speeds, things like backwards compatibility, etc) will be USB 4.0 and it'll be named as so, but that USB 4.0 standard will effectively be the current iteration of thunderbolt. That means guaranteed ability to display video, connect directly to the PCIe bus (in x4 speeds), have serial data speeds at thunderbolt speeds (I think it was 16 Gbps but I'm not certain). This is in contrast with our current latest USB 3.1 gen 2, which has things display out as optional."

The problem with the latest USB 3 (3.1 gen 2) and all usb 3 is that they have optional protocols for things like supporting video. Thunderbolt requires that is supported natively. The coolest part is that usb 4 is going to basically be thunderbolt in all but name. That will make life great for all."

Eep. I just saw that the charitable donations are done as tax credits (the tax credit deducts the tax owed by the dollar amount you donated) so that's kind of crazy if you're looking to reduce tax burden. Damn, I do wish I was making income to actually utilize my knowledge."
todayilearned,fctfl4p,t1_fctc2y5,1577941684.0,"Got bored and decided to rough calculate the taxes you'd pay as a top 5% in Quebec. Ignoring any tax deductions, tax credits, and tax free income (gains on TFSA or similar), a person with income over about $102,300  a year is a top 5%. With that and using the federal and provincial tax brackets, that person pays roughly 19% to each ($19,126 to federal and $19,000 to Quebec). 

Thankfully for you though, you can reduce that with investments into RRSPs, TFSA, CCA if you have a business, and tax credits and tax deductions.
