AskReddit,fe0v2la,t1_fdzfzoy,1578819040.0,"Good job for trying to change!!! It’s never easy and you might lose people in your life you considered friends, but it’s worth it. As for changing reputation, unfortunately you can’t control how others see you, but you can control how you respond and act ... and it will take time for people to see the real you! You just have to build the credibility that you’ve changed just takes time for others to see it. Keep on moving in the right direction! You will see the benefits as you go!  Also as you go through life, you care less and less what people think about you, especially if your happy living the life you’ve created!! Best of luck!"
