Does anyone understand the tricks that your ears can play on you when you already have that term in your mind? She obviously slipped on accident and said something that sounds like the n-word.

conspiracy,ffffrc5,t1_fff9ols,1579882993.0,"I want to hijack this comment to give an anecdote about the probability of accidental contamination. A couple years back my biology professor told the class that she once worked in a high-level biological research lab in Argentina. She said that during transit of a research virus, one of the women scientists left the container on top of her car and drove off, only realizing after it was too late. She couldn’t find that container and prayed that it wouldn’t contaminate anything. 

I think it’s plausible that lab workers get lazy/tired and make mistakes. Im sure there’s a bunch of protocol they have to do in that Chinese lab to make sure they don’t leave the building with traces of the virus on/in them. Maybe someone goofed.

The more comfortable workers are, the more likely they are to make a mistake"

DunderMifflin,ff8ia7x,t1_ff8au0w,1579679739.0,"That doesn’t really make sense though. It doesn’t hurt ed helms and his millions of dollars to write his fictional character as a douche bag. It only hurts the cast/crew/production/writers  by making the show worse and less liked (which can lead to less views).

It wouldn’t make sense for writers at the professional level to take their grudge out on someone so openly in a way that could affect the livelihood of so many other professionals (if it affects the views of the show). I doubt the higher-ups would allow something like that to continue if they caught wind of it (which everyone likely would at table readings early on)."
