I’d never felt so strongly suicidal before...talking about it (on the internet) helped a bit but that possibility of relief, not feeling incomplete, inadequate anymore...I know what you mean."

I’ve just been through so much shit in my life, and I feel like I’m reaching a breaking point. I’ve never felt on par with everyone else, always behind. I had terrible anxiety through high school that would give me constant panic attacks and make me feel like I’m dying. After a ton of hard work I finally manage to get it to a manageable level, then when college starts I get slammed with depression and suicidal thoughts. Feeling like I’d wasted all my life up to that point. After a few months I got rid of that crap for the most part. A little after that I still have minor anxiety problems but I’m feeling the best I’ve ever felt. Free. Then this fucker blows a red light, totals my car and I’m back to being an anxious wreck who also now has a phobia of driving after that incident. It’s been about 3 weeks with no change. Today I went a little out of town, an unfamiliar route, and it gave me so much stress I wanted to cry. Even at the place I couldn’t stop thinking about how much of an almighty fuckup I am. Back at home, and I’m back to being heavily depressed. More than before. I feel that if I was alone with a gun in a room I would be extremely tempted, maybe do it. I’m such a fucking wreck."
