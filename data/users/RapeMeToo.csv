assholedesign,ffj73ui,t1_ffj3xd2,1579992046.0,I've really never had that experience thankfully.
assholedesign,ffj6wbc,t1_ffj40f9,1579991902.0,I find it makes it easier for people with little or no argument to easily dismiss my opinion right or wrong
assholedesign,ffj676e,t1_ffj427l,1579991413.0,That's an interesting Opinion.   I donate to Charity but it's beneficial to me as well.  I'm either giving that money to Uncle Sam or a charity.   Also are you not aware of people charity?   Take the Gates for example
blursedimages,ffj5sa9,t1_ffj58dr,1579991112.0,A lot of people don't fucking care.  What exactly has her little rants achieved?  Any ground breaking policies or anything?
blursedimages,ffj5mn9,t1_ffj5j6x,1579990999.0,Wait you really think they're worried? I really doubt it.  Saudi aramco is the most profitable country in the world by a long shot.
JoeRogan,ffj3rct,t1_ffitpuu,1579989637.0,Except a lot less of them.  Most of us arnt super liberal.
blursedimages,ffj3lp4,t1_ffj2sly,1579989527.0,Yeah thanks Mr bot.  The thing is I'm quite happy where I'm at.  Don't need a new start
teslamotors,ffj3637,t3_ett734,1579989215.0,I honestly thought that truck was a joke. It's real?
blursedimages,ffj2sgd,t1_ffizbmd,1579988949.0,I can say I've never looked at anyone's post history.  It's bizarre to me that someone would care so much about some anonymous online comment to further study them.  Like why? What does it achieve?
blursedimages,ffj2lm6,t1_ffitm1o,1579988814.0,"Honestly who is threatened?  I'm not really a fan but I'm really not that bothered.  People say she's spreading awareness but honestly who's not aware?   People can be aware and just not give a fuck.  ""Oh who's this angry child?  Oh shit wait really? Why didn't anyone tell me about climate change?"" Said no one"
blursedimages,ffj2dlp,t1_ffiyfva,1579988657.0,It doesn't work like that but ok
Wellthatsucks,ffj24on,t1_ffj21nr,1579988480.0,As low as they're willing to accept

reactiongifs,ffiy581,t3_etq67z,1579985591.0,My gym is finally almost back to normal.   Fuck the first couple weeks with fat chicks doing curls in the squat rack was lame.  Thankfully they all pretty much gave up.
assholedesign,ffixv1v,t1_ffiuqnu,1579985384.0,I've noticed Reddit really hates successful people.   I retired at 38 and have a few rental properties.  Apparently I'm a blood sucking Nazi leach.  Oh well
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffivy3i,t1_ffivtnc,1579984005.0,So all of them.  How many times can the house send articles of impeachment to the Senate?  For example when Trump is aquited will they just start again? Do they have wait until he wins a second term?
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffivgtn,t1_ffimzut,1579983686.0,Trump could cure cancer and people would still find a way to complain.  What the hell are news networks going to talk about when trump leaves office?  He's literally dominates media.  It's impressive.
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffiv0bp,t1_ffio9mm,1579983392.0,I wonder if we're just gonna try to impeach every president from now on.
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffimz0s,t1_ffi82dx,1579977752.0,Success and capitalism bad amirite?
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffimw49,t1_ffils1u,1579977697.0,I mean both can be true
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffimtx5,t3_etq85w,1579977654.0,I think people would be more invested if we weren't calling for impeachment before he even took office.
memes,ffii5ua,t1_ffibnai,1579974439.0,Probably more Twinkies?
worldnews,ffifx3s,t1_ffidw5c,1579972919.0,Oh you don't have any social media accounts?  Good for you man. Good for you.  No apps either?  Never signed a TOS?  That's amazing.
worldnews,ffidbqu,t1_ffibztf,1579971160.0,I literally agreed to my data being watched.  We all do.
worldnews,ffi9kf4,t1_ffguztd,1579968574.0,"Neat quote.  Tell me where was your phone manufactured and do you honestly think your data isn't being watched?  ""A false sense of privacy is better than none at all"" u/Beefbin"
ShittyLifeProTips,ffge2mt,t3_etdg14,1579904172.0,"""retired"".  Can't say I'd be mad.   Now run along and get to work."

worldnews,ffgd68n,t1_ffenoqp,1579903611.0,"Between Google, Facebook and the NSA and whoever else I already am. What are they gonna possibly uncover?  Some Chinese server has my porn bookmarks.  Oh no!"
Cringetopia,ffgd0n2,t1_fff2b0e,1579903513.0,I'm almost half convinced Reddit allows it to keep all the racism in one place.  Sort of how when they ban one sub all the fucktards migrate to another sub.  That's what happened to r/imgoingtohellforthis.   It used to be a decent sub now it's full blown racist cess pit like FWR
