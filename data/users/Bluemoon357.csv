Blue Monday is the new name given to a day in January (typically the third Monday of the month) claimed to be the most depressing day of the year. The date is generally reported as falling on the third Monday in January, but also on the second or fourth Monday, or the Monday of the last full week of January.

The formula uses many factors, including: weather conditions, debt level (the difference between debt accumulated and our ability to pay), time since Christmas, time since failing our new yearâ€™s resolutions, low motivational levels and feeling of a need to take action."
