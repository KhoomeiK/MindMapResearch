She may have also known people to get her foot in the door (especially in politics).  Nowadays it’s completely different, if you don’t know someone then a college education is almost mandatory.

Her career history seems to make up for it in the most part—she has a history of speaking and politics.  I think the biggest reason is this admin is a fucking train wreck and she knows it, but doesn’t want to give up the prestige and salary."

Everyone keeps trying to dismiss evil for stupidity, it’s crazy."

todayilearned,fds44r4,t1_fds2f1c,1578693960.0,"Yeah, true.  I had a 16 year old script kiddie pictured when I was thinking about this.  If professionals actually had a plan in place then I can see where you’re coming from.  Also “poorfag” lol, I haven’t seen “fag” tacked on to the end of a word since I was like 14... it felt oddly nostalgic."
todayilearned,fds1mu5,t1_fds0yzt,1578692996.0,"I can’t even imagine trying to defend this to a jury that’s half made up of people who don’t even know how to use (or even trust) computers.  Then prosecution is going to overload them with technical jargon and paint the picture so dark that the defense’s layman term explanation will sound awful.  But if you go into detail you risk the jury burning out and giving a guilty, as he did technically break the law. 

If it were me I don’t think I’d want this to go in front of a jury to be honest... computers are complex and TV has painted any kind of hacker as a bad guy."
todayilearned,fds11dv,t1_fdrie3i,1578692625.0,"Most of the PCs being infected are so dated they might mine $1/year, but will work flawlessly as part of a botnet.  I’d wager to say you’d need a shit ton of computers to make either one worth it.  Think of the average $300 Walmart PC someone’s grandma has... that’s going to make up 90%+ of the power available. 

No one would waste their time crypto-mining with “less than 100 bots”. 

Hell, another big thing for botnets now is a lot of homes have unsecured smart TVs, fridges, toasters, lightbulbs... they can’t mine but they can definitely ping servers."

I can see how people would be hesitant to trust him, or not feel violated by someone going through their shit even if it was for good."
todayilearned,fdryvp4,t1_fdrer4t,1578691826.0,"White hats definition is literally abiding by the law.  Gray hat hackers dig into systems and report vulnerabilities, and sometimes go to prison for it, even though they’re “doing the right thing”.  The only time it’s ok to dig around on system files would be if a company has a bounty program, which would then make anything done white hat. 

If you’re breaking the law to do something good/neutral, you’re a gray hat."
todayilearned,fdrygrr,t1_fdrm82f,1578691611.0,"I would hate being a judge on a CFAA case that involves a gray hat, especially one like this (*if* he solely patched the routers and nothing malicious was done on the way out, and that’s a big if).  Technically broke the law, but for the right reason... maybe a month probation?  But at the same time I wouldn’t want him to have a record. I have no clue.  But at the same time you don’t want to encourage hackers to update/patch things they see fit simply because they can. 


I’ve spent too long thinking about this."

The sail boat is solar powered with underwater turbines.  She’s also declined awards as to not have to travel and is very select about where she gives speeches.  Outside of that I’m sure she uses electric vehicles. 

This is just from 5 min of googling, but it seems her and her team are very aware of her footprint and go out of their way to keep it low."

Getting a boot enchant (lightning damage if you haven't kill recently) will add 11% more damage on bosses without adds.  A double damage stygian will add around 12% more damage.  Getting more jewel slots will add around 5% or so per decent jewel.  Your wand is good, but the people you're comparing to probably have great wands.  I plugged in a random top 10 guys wand into your build and it was a 22% more damage increase alone.

Small things like that add up to a *lot* of damage."
