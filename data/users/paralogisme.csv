StarWarsCantina,ffif961,t3_etm1jj,1579972461.0,"Ugh, I get downvoted whenever I suggest that maybe Luke is a great Jedi because he was never subjected to strict jedi dogma. That similarly Rey is a great Jedi because she was taught by someone not subjected to strict jedi dogma. I always felt that jedi are better jedi if they don't cut themselves off completely from negative emotions. That's why Obiwan is one of my favourite Jedi. His nemesis killed the love of his life and yet he still consoled the guy while he was dying in his arms. I genuinely think that Anakin would never have gone dark if he was trained by someone like Luke, ironically. Anakin was simply way too old when he started training to be taught to not feel love and anger, to suppress them. Had he been taught to control them instead, to let his feelings pass through him, things would be different. Honestly, Anakin needed a DBT trained therapist. 

And I think that Rey and the defeated Luke on ach-to are an important theme in this age where we're talking a lot about mental health awareness and the whole ""feelings are good"" thing."

Synesthesia,ffi7um4,t3_etqthv,1579967363.0,"I have OLP, but it's not as complex as this. I mean, my numbers do have gender, personality and relationships (7 is creepy, 8 is pretty, 8 is afraid of 7) but they're not so pronounced. Like gender is easy for me (except for 4, 4 is a bit confused) but other stuff takes observation, I guess. I have to kinda observe them in my head, like I'm watching a TV show with them as characters. But yeah, even just genders would mean it's OLP, so welcome."

Yeah, I don't think he ever doubted jedi abilities like telekinesis, rather stuff like Luke hitting the vent without help from sensors, for example. Personally I always believed that he's one of those people force really likes but aren't force sensitive. I think he gets hints and subtle pushes from the force but his nature is to attribute it to His Awesomeness instead."
AskReddit,ffgdidg,t3_etcyd6,1579903822.0,"This is gonna make me super unpopular but, take away their guns. 60 percent of men commit suicide via firearm as opposed to 30 percent of women. There are 2 female suicide attempts for 1 male. Women try more, but men tend to be more successful because they tend to use firearms. So, take away firearms from at risk men. After you take away their escape tactic, at least some of them will consider treatment. So basically before you can help them, you gotta keep them alive first."

She looks like she's happily moving in with her college boyfriend or something. I don't think she's the kind of person who would be that at peace with herself if she felt she lost something. She was distraught about Han and she'd just met him, so I think if Ben was fully gone from her life, she would not feel that content."

StarWarsCantina,ffbp8h3,t1_ff9ys4s,1579776839.0,"I agree with everything. Except I think we take palps words for granted. Who says Rey would rule the galaxy? If it's possible to corrupt a spirit, wouldn't it also be possible to cleanse it? We've seen it done both with kyber and we can argue that they do have a spirit. What if his spirit entering hers would cleanse the dark side? Palps would be gone, galaxy would be safe and no one would die at all, even temporarily.

I don't know, I'm just making up theories that could have spared Ben. As much as the ending feels right, I still miss the homicidal bugger a lot."
