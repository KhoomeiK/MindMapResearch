quityourbullshit,fb47zzo,t1_fb45lbk,1576503582.0,"The phrase ""people of all economic statuses are moving to texas"" was not written. What it did say is that new families were moving there because or affordable housing; which again how is relevant if you happen to be a family that isn't able to take advantage of that for many reasons beside being poor.

And the random example of Texas doesn't refute my point that in general red states are faring worse than blue ones, especially for the most poor. Or actually never mind they should just move to Texas and look at things in a vacuum."
