AskReddit,fgpkyea,t3_ez2v7x,1581006884.0,"Diet is arguably the most important part of losing weight and building muscle. There's an old saying that ""abs are made in the kitchen"" and there's good reason for that! You could exercise every day, but if you fill your body with empty calories from junk food and sugary drinks like soda and sweet coffees, you'll never lose weight. Generally speaking, you want to follow the CICO method (or Calories in, Calories Out). It's all about creating a calorie deficit so that you are burning more calories in a day than you are taking in. Using a free tool like MyFitnessPal to count calories is probably the best way to keep yourself accountable: [https://www.myfitnesspal.com/](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/)

As for building muscle, protein is HUGELY important to see the results you're likely looking for. This article has some great recommendations for post-workout foods that will aid with muscle recovery: [https://www.openfit.com/muscle-recovery-foods](https://www.openfit.com/muscle-recovery-foods)

As for what exercises to do, that really depends on your goals. For example, if you're looking to build a six-pack, you're going to need to focus on core exercises. If you just want to ""get fit"" then you'll want to build out a balanced workout plan that will cover all of your major muscle areas. I'd recommend starting with some of the free workouts on Openfit and try to gauge your interests:

loseit,fggfbb5,t3_exy7qd,1580760672.0,"Unfortunately for you, what you were doing originally is the only way to lose weight and get healthy. Too many people focus on finding quick fixes, when in reality, losing weight is one of the hardest things to do, which is why so many people are overweight. Junk food tastes good, and is addicting, so without it people feel miserable. You won't have to count calories for the rest of your life, because once you reach your goal you'll have developed the skills to maintain a healthy lifestyle, but if you want to lose weight, you have to be in a caloric deficit. 

There are hundreds of diets out there that promise to be different, but the root of all is that you eat fewer calories than you burn in a day. Everyone has a TDEE, or total daily energy expenditure, which is the amount of calories that your body burns in a single day. Eating about 70-80% of that number will allow you to lose weight at a healthy rate of 1-2 pounds per week. As simple as this sounds, the dedication and commitment that it takes is why it's so hard for people to lose weight. This ""diet"" is called CICO, and you can learn more about it here: [https://www.openfit.com/what-is-cico](https://www.openfit.com/what-is-cico)

Along with following a CICO diet, you should focus on your overall health, which is extremely affected by poor food choices. For example, say you can eat 1,500 calories a day. If you spend those calories at McDonald's, you won't be making choices that are good for your overall health. Fried food, junk food, and simple sugars are just some of the things that everyone should stay away from in order to be healthy: [https://www.openfit.com/eat-way-great-abs-7-tips](https://www.openfit.com/eat-way-great-abs-7-tips)"

weddingplanning,fg0718t,t3_evrya5,1580401605.0,"I personally think that everyone should send out save the dates. Save the dates are different from formal invitations, because they allow people to make sure that they don't make any other plans for that day. 

When it comes to a destination wedding, you need to let people know way ahead of time so that they can start saving and planning for the trip. While San Diego isn't as crazy as Hawaii or the Bahamas, it will be expensive for some people.

This wedding etiquette timeline says that you should send out save the dates between 6-12 months, however I would do them ASAP, because the more notice they have, the better: [https://www.magnetstreet.com/wedding-stationery-timeline](https://www.magnetstreet.com/wedding-stationery-timeline)"

AskDocs,fdnl8rb,t3_ekirz7,1578588145.0,"No. Weight loss pills, while they might seem like a fix-all, are more or less a scam. Not only do they not help you lose weight, they can make you sick. Like someone else said below, if there were pills that worked, everyone would use them. The only way to lose weight is by eating less calories than you burn, which is referred to as the CICO diet: [https://www.openfit.com/what-is-cico](https://www.openfit.com/what-is-cico)

Everybody burns a different number of calories per day (TDEE) and that number is based on your height, weight, age, and activity level. It is recommended that you eat about 20% less than your TDEE in order to lose a healthy amount of weight per week. You need to use a calorie tracking app and a food scale to get the exact amount of calories you can eat per week. Stop thinking of losing weight as a race and you will be just fine. Good luck!"

loseit,fdncso1,t3_em13q3,1578583029.0,"Losing weight and building muscle are too different things that require 2 different diet/workout plans. It is possible to lose fat and build muscle at the same time, but most people will reach their weight goal before they start to bulk up. If you are trying to lose weight still, you don't want to increase your calories. The basis of weight loss is eating fewer calories than the body burns in a day, so increasing your calories will only do the opposite of what you're trying to achieve. It is possible to get more protein without upping your calories, and this can be done by substituting red meat for fish, or adding beans to your meals.

crossfit,fdk41b9,t3_el8uo2,1578495530.0,"I have found that the biggest problem I have in the gym comes from motivating myself to stick it out, deal with the pain, and keep on moving. This is personally true in all forms of exercise whether that be cardio or lifting. While everyone has their physical limitations, our mind can keep us from achieving goals that our bodies are physically capable of achieving. For example, sometimes when I bench, if I'm not properly motivated to continue my set I will give up and not reach the number of reps I need. Something that helps me a ton is visualizing myself/what I look like when I've reached all of my goals. You need to find what motivates you and hold on to that.
