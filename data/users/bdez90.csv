xmen,ff6bi7d,t1_ff6aywk,1579623564.0,I personally haven't read anything with Mojo in it for a long time so I won't complain. Who knows though.

NintendoSwitch,femn6to,t1_fel49go,1579263388.0,Its also not something worth crying over
NintendoSwitch,fekrp6w,t1_fekfcnf,1579206215.0,Gee wiz it's almost like you don't understand that Nintendo focuses on their national customers first.
NintendoSwitch,fek0ifd,t1_fek0bmq,1579189991.0,For me personally? Yeah I like FE much more than Mario at least. Everyone saying FE isn't that popular doesn't live in Japan.
NintendoSwitch,fejzy8l,t1_fejtsay,1579189643.0,"Can't reply to everyone but all you people saying FE isn't that popular don't live in Japan lol. Nintendo puts them in there because it sells games. Some of them are clones yes but people like Ike, Robin and Corrin play very differently. Byleth also has a really varied moveset compared to the others. There's no way to get around sword characters feeling similar. Hell Link, TL and YL all play extremely similar but yet I'm not bothered by it."
NintendoSwitch,fejtsay,t3_epjryb,1579185672.0,Everyone cries about FE characters meanwhile there are just as many or more from Mario and Pokemon. It's a popular series get over it.
NintendoSwitch,fejrjaa,t1_fejr75g,1579184056.0,A character that is an assist trophy is never going to be a fighter

aww,feefm6r,t1_feebde3,1579032761.0,I understand the positive emotions sure. It's hard to lay out my points here in such an informal way. I'll just say I hope you and your family stays happy and healthy.
aww,fee68nk,t3_eonffw,1579027253.0,Second post I saw on here today about not having kids but then having one. I have the exact opposite things to say here because adopting is very unselfish and I wish more people did this instead.
aww,fedy5t8,t1_fedt91h,1579022368.0,"Like I said, at least that's honest."
aww,fedsjf9,t3_eokyfc,1579018970.0,Having a child is such a selfish thing to me I can't understand why people think it's so positive. Use your brain and think past your instincts or be honest about the fact that its only there to take care of you when you're dying.

marvelstudios,fea9seh,t3_eo6p67,1578946053.0,Can't wait to not see this shit. Sony is committing vampirism on Marvel ironically enough.
HonkaiImpact,fe7y6vb,t1_fe7x0ba,1578920479.0,I could not find a way to do that either :/ was trying to make a new google one but I had barely done anything anyway.
HonkaiImpact,fe7uau5,t3_eo2yvn,1578919340.0,I started a new account after not playing for at least a year. At least right now with the current event I've found it pretty damn easy to assemble almost a dozen good valkyries. The way they've reorganized the story makes it really easy to jump into that or replay it if you missed anything.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fe5f1hr,t1_fdup84p,1578868674.0,Overhaul already has a serum made. It shouldn't be very hard for them to get it reversed.

worldnews,fdoboq8,t1_fdo406j,1578602273.0,"Lol you people jump so fast to assume just because I think Trump made a stupid ass decision I ""side with Iran."" It's about him not considering the consequences and bringing about unnecessary aggression. Apparently know one learned anything from Iraq. Not even mentioning the sheer hypocrisy of killing him because he was a ""bad guy"" when we work with the same types of people, if not worse, all the time."

politics,fdh7oi6,t3_elbas7,1578417164.0,Of course he can but the corporate democratic elites would rather lose to Trump then have Bernie win. They have the same donors as all the asshole republicans.
xmen,fdeetmb,t1_fddwalf,1578337474.0,Man I forgot about Demin Bear. Makes the whole horror aspect actually make sense.
Games,fdee9w6,t3_ekw7gp,1578337132.0,Is this real life
aww,fddq9n9,t1_fddjhig,1578321084.0,Maybe because it doesn't really matter?
aww,fddq89y,t1_fddjvjm,1578321052.0,Way to take internet gifs way too seriously
gaming,fdcffjw,t3_ekhlv7,1578273574.0,Yeah everyone in the past was super happy about everything all the time. No one was bitter in the 90s /s
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fd9tzgk,t1_fd73gk1,1578237986.0,"Yeah thanks that's why I said ""if this wasn't anime."" 
On a related note in the last ep Overhaul said they were in fact knocked out but he repaired the one dudes brain."

StarWars,fcyxhpt,t3_ejinrx,1578089240.0,All well and good but they don't give you any reference of that in the movies. Also Dooku didn't do shit to free anyone.

NintendoSwitch,fcyo8zy,t1_fcykm90,1578083766.0,No they wouldn't. I wouldn't have said that
NintendoSwitch,fcxhxs9,t1_fcwpneq,1578063369.0,Yeah because OP meant they should never improve it ever. They meant the general concept of handheld and console in one.
ffxiv,fclhqk2,t3_ehnlya,1577748071.0,This is old news
atheism,fcgj0uq,t1_fcfzpyy,1577640605.0,Yeah and the argument would be if that's what God wants then its moral by definition. Obviously stupid.
atheism,fcfwtp3,t3_eh44xv,1577634451.0,I think its pretty obvious you can be moral without a god but the argument I hear more often is without a god there is no standard for morality. There's no such thing as an objective morality and the whole point of society is to establish agreed upon ways to live. Mostly religous people can't stand the fact that bad people don't get tortured for all eternity after they die.

BokuNoHeroAcademia,fcfpv1l,t1_fcda8pp,1577632610.0,He trains constantly and is completely ripped. If a 17/18 year old that big/fit punched a normal human in the head they'd be down no question.
comicbooks,fcc8173,t1_fcbthb2,1577595432.0,Who the fuck cares
comicbooks,fcbrnsl,t1_fcb2pe4,1577590210.0,Lol the only reason the movies exist is because he invented the characters
comicbooks,fcb0830,t1_fc95rxv,1577580090.0,Yeah a post about Stan Lee on his birthday has no place in r/comicbooks
AnimalsBeingJerks,fcazxgs,t1_fc9cz9l,1577579926.0,It's a sandslash
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fc9ryir,t1_fc95yha,1577557315.0,honestly though if this wasn't anime all those dudes he full power clocked in the head would be KOed undoubtedly

StarWars,fc0iqee,t1_fc0b6tf,1577291726.0,Yeah because we need even more recycled villains.
