The larger the carrier the more stable it is too as waves have a reduced impact against the increased mass. As for propulsion you just keep adding engines until it can move. There would probably be major limitations on where it could move though due to shallow waters or narrow openings.

AskReddit,fcgzrw4,t1_fcgwfoj,1577645752.0,"Exaactly. There's soo much help available for different parenting techniques but those sorts of parents simply aren't interested and are too lazy. I know kids that were nuisances at school that have already had kids and are parenting them the same way. It's an endless cycle and must be related to british culture somehow. 
I too am amazed at people who put their kids on leashes. A child isn't a pet and shouldn't have its freedom to explore restricted like that imo. It's taking away a huge part of learning and becoming independent.

But anyway, rest assured it gets much better after school. I remember thinking that i just hated people in general when I was in school but now see that it was just those specific people that I disliked. I can't speak much for how it is in other countries as I've lived in the UK my whole life but have a hard time thinking of a place that would be worse."

It's mostly shitty parenting at the base of it whom then expect the school to deal with their shitty kids that they haven't taught how to be a decent human being. It's the parents that yell and slap at their kids for the tiniest bit of misbehaviour that end up with kids that are chaos at schools. It's the kids that have never been praised for anything. At sixth form and uni these kids get weeded out as they typically don't make the grades to get into uni, have no career prospects, and drop out to work for their dads or whatever. I hated my time at school utterly (I went to an all boys school which seemed to amplify the problems above). Uni was a breath of fresh air with people that actually wanted to be there and knew how to treat others.
