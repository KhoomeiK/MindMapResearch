depression,ffguae0,t3_etjz6c,1579915233.0,"Yeah it’s not a good feeling. In the slightest. Music is basically all I have at this point. If I lost feeling for it altogether, I genuinely think I’d just off myself."
depression,ffgtf5a,t3_etjspf,1579914598.0,So I’m ungrateful because I’m depressed? Yeah ok. BS.
depression,ffew7og,t3_et6r7q,1579868109.0,"That’s absolutely disgusting! She needs to be put in prison for life! Nothing makes me more sick than pedophiles! She isn’t your mom she is a monster. And so is her boyfriend. Both of them can go rot for eternity. I’m so sorry you had to go through something so horrible! No child deserves that! Heck, no person deserves that! 

You absolutely have value honey. It’s just animals like them try to exploit it and convince you otherwise. In other words, they were too pathetic to see your value. Don’t ever let “people” like that determine your worth. I hope you can tell a professional one day because they should both be in prison for child pornography. Though I understand you not wanting to talk to anyone about it at least hear me out on this. What if they did it to another child? Or children? Wouldn’t you want them to be held accountable? And even if they never did, you shouldn’t even give them the opportunity. I’m by no means trying to guilt you, it’s not at all your fault. But what I'm saying is you speaking up could not only save yourself, but others. Again, words can’t describe how sorry I am you had to experience that and please don’t believe the lie they’ve convinced you of: that you have no value.  Because you do. Infinitely more than either of those creeps ever will."
driving,ffbzrci,t1_ffazkku,1579787808.0,Thanks!
driving,ffarvm7,t3_erx9w0,1579743042.0,I failed mine too just today. I was feeling somewhat confident in the beginning but got anxious pretty quick and completely screwed up maneuverability. Which I knew I was gonna mess up on anyway. Just know you’re not alone I felt pretty awful afterwards too. Had to try really hard not to cry. I  hope you’re able to take your test again soon and pass.
depression,ffaqpzt,t3_eshka7,1579742266.0,Same! I just wish I could wake up one day and not need to take nap two hours later! And even then STILL feel like I’ve gotten zero sleep!
depression,ffalfnn,t1_ffa7op4,1579738691.0,Yeah I need more time to get to that point. But thanks. I appreciate it.
depression,ffa6nur,t3_esedcq,1579728919.0,People are jerks. Sorry they said something so horrible.
depression,ff9r9be,t3_esg44c,1579719333.0,"7. “Just talk to a professional” 

Yeah because everybody can afford/has the circumstances to do that. Also the kind of “professional” you’re referring to isn’t yourself."
depression,ff9r3aj,t3_esg9x5,1579719199.0,I’m really sorry you’re dealing with these feelings.
depression,ff6c0nd,t3_err22y,1579623893.0,I’m really sorry you lost her
depression,ff5jbwo,t3_erqjbv,1579595561.0,"I also see it as people who haven’t taken you seriously up till now, finally will. And in a sense that’ll prove just how fake they really are. I dream about like attempting suicide and “succeeding” in the sense that I die, but someone ends up reviving me and I end up in the hospital for a long while."
depression,fednbrh,t3_eoky9h,1579015692.0,Yeah I’ve noticed this too. It sucks because people are posting on here most time as a last resort. They have nobody else to talk to and they want at least someone to respond. But a lot of times people don’t. And I know not every single post can be/will be answered. But still. That doesn’t make it any less discouraging.
depression,fedn52p,t1_fe28rvx,1579015571.0,"No he didn’t lose his job. He makes infinitely more than I do. It’s just like I said he makes payments to my mom monthly and he doesn’t always work when he should due to depression. He’s also been sick the past two weeks so I can understand not working then but it’s still hard on me who works a minimum wage job to hand over money to someone who makes way more than that. 

But yeah I guess you’re right. I’ll try my best to save up something. Thanks for the kind words."
depression,fdqtqyy,t3_empzok,1578674692.0,Yeah it’s kind of frustrating cause I’m usually considered a happy person so when someone just randomly asks if I’m mad when I’m not it’s annoying. And then they don’t ask when I actually am. So yeah. Completely backwards.
depression,fdp5acv,t1_fdoyxru,1578620324.0,"Same. I have pretty much nothing better to do anyway, nor do I have the motivation to do anything else either. So it really doesn’t matter either way. I know it’s not healthy but again, I’ve nothing else to do. Nothing else I want to do. Nobody to do anything with."

depression,fdo0s0e,t3_em1ggo,1578596759.0,I’m taking a break from social media for the second time. I honestly can’t stand it anymore. All it does is shove an idealistic lifestyle down your throat that is for most people completely unobtainable. It’s a huge time waster and really only adds to people’s depression.
depression,fdo0m8p,t3_em5cvo,1578596664.0,Aw I hope you find them.
depression,fdo0ffz,t3_em40kf,1578596551.0,I crave it from anybody and everybody. I honestly crave it to what I consider to be an unhealthy and scary degree.
depression,fdo0aly,t3_em82f6,1578596472.0,"You did what you could. And that’s amazing! You did SOMETHING! Which as you showed, is clearly more than can be said for most if they were in that situation. I hope that girl gets the help she needs and understands that somebody really wanted to help her. Good for you for taking the time to say something though. That was very considerate of you. Which the world honestly needs so much more of."
depression,fdm0amy,t3_em331s,1578536761.0,"Same! I’ve been really down lately and therefore not very social. But the main thing that made me down was the fact that all my “friends” seemingly forgot about me. Then once they finally noticed I wasn’t happy, after months mind you, they decided to ask what was wrong. But only cause they thought I had something against them. So in other words not because they really care. It sucks. Big time."
depression,fdlzxq4,t1_fdlauex,1578536515.0,No it’s perfectly fine. I completely understand. And thanks same to you!
depression,fdl6csa,t3_elum9u,1578517804.0,"I’m really sorry. That’s all I can think to say, truly."
depression,fdl1eqg,t1_fdkdkqd,1578515369.0,"I’m sorry she treated you that way. Like you said, if she’d been calm there’d have been NO reason to have a argument. You could’ve talked things out. Perhaps even at a better time when you weren’t gonna be tired. I hate it when parents bring up a bunch of unnecessary things just to fuel their argument. If anything it’s ironically enough, very immature. And you’re also right about the respect issue. Yes it’s important to respect your elders but said elders should not be making it harder for you to do so. Thanks for commenting though. Makes me feel less alone in the matter. Pretty much everyone else I know would just fluff it off and most likely defend my dads actions. Or come up with petty excuses for it."
depression,fdk9tef,t3_eleyhh,1578499313.0,"I’m sorry you have to fight these feelings. But I feel the same way. Every time I find something/someone that makes me happy I think, “Well, this isn’t gonna last.” And it doesn’t. Being alive is just a burden at this point. I’ve literally been called a burden by my parents. If I was dead, I wouldn’t have to be."
depression,fdk9lkj,t3_elpxkm,1578499178.0,"Yeah I kind of feel the same way. Like I’m just so unaccustomed to opening up that the rare time, I do I feel guilty about it later."
depression,fdk9dzc,t3_elqwy9,1578499046.0,"My “family” fell apart year ago and they’re my adopted “family.”, not even my real one. My mom is terrible person who’s a gaslighter and a constant liar whom I don’t talk to anymore. The rest of my family just likes to blame me for a lot of their problems, so basically just a bunch of fakes who pretend they’re good people when around others. I have little to no friends, all people wanna do is tell me what to do differently instead of actually listening to my feelings, or they just straight up ignore me. I feel I’d be better off dead at this point so I could stop being a problem to everyone else and myself."
depression,fdgskqz,t1_fdfhstk,1578407243.0,"You need time. Lots of it. Be patient with yourself, and give yourself that time you need to grow and heal. I have faith you’ll get there in the end."
depression,fdfhiqw,t3_el3xd6,1578361827.0,Constantly. I’ll think back to a random time I said or did something dumb and feel incredibly guilty about it. Or just overthink it completely.
depression,fdfhfsq,t3_el3zb5,1578361772.0,I hang around older people too. But I mean like way older like 50s-80s. I don’t really like people my age as there’s too much drama and just in general they don’t make very good friends.
depression,fdfhaqk,t3_el40oz,1578361678.0,Good for you!
depression,fdfh8rr,t3_el41t0,1578361642.0,I don’t blame you for not wanting to take her back again. That’s just too much of an emotional roller coaster for both of you. But you especially. You can’t keep having your hopes brought up only for them to be crushed again. And she ought not be so indecisive. I hope you’re able to heal from this breakup and find some peace. I don’t really know what else to say cause I’m no expert so my apologies there. All I can do is wish you the best.
depression,fdfgyf3,t3_el45t6,1578361451.0,"Men should be able to cry. It’s perfectly natural for both men and women. And anyone who says otherwise, is an idiot."
depression,fdfgtfa,t3_el1q99,1578361361.0,I’m glad you had the strength to speak up and that your mom was understanding. Good luck on getting help!
depression,fddxgej,t3_eksxke,1578326339.0,"I’m sorry but your own mother blaming you for the fact your dad could have a stroke, is absolutely disgusting! That is the epitome of emotional manipulation! She should know better! And he shouldn’t just assume that because you’re seeking professional help, that means you’re “crazy.” If anything that’s a completely rational and reasonable thing to do. Heck at this rate, I think they too should be seeking professional help. They CLEARLY need it! But in the meantime, I’m sorry they’re so insensitive and cruel. I hope you get the help you need regardless of what they say/do. At this point it’s about what’s best for you, not them."
depression,fddx23j,t1_fdctnfr,1578326072.0,No problem!
depression,fdcrg28,t1_fdcrbnf,1578282214.0,Thanks!
depression,fdcr4h5,t1_fdcnxc1,1578281974.0,That must be hard to deal with. I’m sorry you have to. I hope you get achieve things that make you happy one day too. Thanks for taking the time to read and reply though. It’s nice knowing I’m not completely alone in this matter.
depression,fdcqtwi,t1_fdcoi2n,1578281755.0,"Also the only reason I didn’t want to post about the comment was because it wasn’t really that essential to the argument. Not necessarily “suspicious”, it’s just I'd already deleted the comment and apologized anyway so it didn’t really make sense in my opinion."
depression,fdcqmt7,t1_fdcoi2n,1578281610.0,"Yeah I kind of figured someone would feel the need to point this out but like I said a person said their boyfriend left them on account of their depression and asked for comfort. So I said I hoped they found someone who would love them  enough not give up on them one day. So this one guy decided to tell me I didn’t know what the f I was taking about and that her boyfriend wasn’t a therapist. And I agreed. Saying I wasn’t either and that I was sorry for giving off the wrong idea. That I’m not capable of responding the way everyone wants/needs. Like I said, anyone who said anything similar had a bunch of downvotes and the same person cussing at them for saying what they did.  Yeah it may have come across wrong, but that was no excuse to go around getting on people’s cases. I think it just touched the persons nerve more than anything. I think they were in a relationship with a depressed person at one point and left them because they couldn’t handle it, and now think that anyone who says otherwise needs to be got on. I admitted that not everyone can handle that sort of thing, and that’s ok. But still. Everybody’s different. Like I said, touched a nerve that had already been hit by others saying the essentially the same thing I did."
depression,fdcm0yq,t1_fdcluxd,1578278251.0,You’re welcome. And thank you too!
depression,fdclxi1,t3_eklj68,1578278181.0,Congrats! I look forward to the day I can do the same. Hopefully anyway.
depression,fdclr2j,t3_eknc3u,1578278051.0,"I’m sorry your parents are so awful to you. I can relate in some ways. I get made fun of for crying sometimes too and have many times in the past, and I deeply struggle to show my emotions to anyone as result, and for the most part bottle it up so I won’t have to. Like one time I cried because my dad yelled at me over something minor and my brother proceeded to tell me I was an ugly crier and needed to stop. So yeah. That really helped things. I hope you can leave that toxic situation, and soon. Then hopefully you can start healing and do what’s best for YOU. I wish you the best."
depression,fdclc78,t3_ekmwm5,1578277756.0,Same! I’m lucky to get out of bed and go to work when I’m scheduled. I just can’t bring myself to be motivated enough to do anything else. It’s so frustrating!
depression,fdcl8gk,t3_ekjn4t,1578277683.0,I’m sorry you’re so down. I hope you can somehow overcome these feelings and see you’re a great person.
depression,fdcl5ab,t3_ekkff1,1578277620.0,Wishing you the absolute best!
depression,fdcl3pz,t3_ekl0zq,1578277590.0,Same. If I didn’t have music I’d literally have nothing.
depression,fdcl0s7,t1_fdcbykx,1578277531.0,"Agreed. I just got done being cussed out and downvoted for saying something others didn’t agree with. It’s also overwhelming when you can’t respond the way everyone wants/needs you to. I want to, but’s impossible. And sometimes you end up paying the price for it. And as you said it’s just overwhelming in general sometimes, and I do desensitized to some things now as a result. Think I’m gonna take a break from here for a while."
depression,fdckq3q,t3_ekifxn,1578277320.0,"That’s ridiculous! If you need help, they should give it! No questions asked! Makes me mad."
depression,fdckmaq,t3_ekg49i,1578277243.0,Aww I’m so happy for you! Great job!
depression,fdckjvf,t3_ekmksg,1578277196.0,That’s my safe space
depression,fdckeq9,t3_ekn1vb,1578277093.0,"I mean if it’s a means of coping, I get it. But at the same time there’s a good time and place, and a bad one. Plus, if it’s public you’re setting yourself up to be criticized. And harshly. I suppose it’s just up to the person posting wether or not it’s a good decision. And I’m the same I could never have my friends and family know about it so openly. It’d be too much."
depression,fdchy1h,t3_ekby0j,1578275341.0,"Sorry my previous comment caused such offense. I’ve never been through something like this and I’m not gonna pretend like I have, nor was I trying to. Was simply trying to offer some sympathy, but clearly didn't go about it the right way. Regardless, I hope you get through this ok."
depression,fdchfjs,t1_fdc5fov,1578274973.0,"No I don’t. And I’m not saying I do. I was just trying to offer some sympathy. Clearly it came across the wrong way, and I’m sorry. But still. I’d say if you really care about someone you’d try your best to help them through their depression. But then again I understand not everyone can handle that sort of thing. There’s really no need to get that offended, jeez. Calm down. It was a simple misunderstanding. It happens. Not worth freaking out over and attacking me for it. Again, that was my version of sympathy. If you don’t like it, sorry. We’re all different. They asked for someone to try and cheer them up not offer a solution to their problem. I’m not a therapist either so don’t expect me to always know the right thing to say. Don’t expect anyone too. We’re all human we’re not always gonna say the thing someone wants/needs to hear. That’s no reason to go off on the person when they don’t though. Again, really sorry for the offense. God you’d think I’d killed someone with how you just responded."
depression,fd6c0vn,t1_fd6a0us,1578188664.0,Sorry you have to experience that kind of struggle. I hope you can win the battle against those feelings.

depression,fd69utw,t3_ek5nig,1578187732.0,Mint chocolate chip. Forever and always.
depression,fd68mmb,t3_ek0i2i,1578187178.0,"My friends only checked when I seemed upset with them. So basically they only felt the need to see when they thought it was personal. Otherwise, they don’t say a thing. But whatever. They have their own problems, but they also have each other to get through them. Unlike me."
depression,fd68f1b,t3_ejx4cu,1578187075.0,"Yeah I’d like to see the pieces of crap who say this kind of stuff, spend a whole week in your shoes. Then we’ll see if they’re still talking."
depression,fd688yl,t3_ejw74l,1578186997.0,Same! I just turned 19 and I feel like I’ve wasted my childhood. Or what a lame excuse for one I had anyway.
depression,fd683tq,t3_ek3uky,1578186934.0,"Because that’s not a human being. That’s a cruel and selfish monster. I’m so sorry that happened to you. You’ll find far better one day. Aka someone who actually deserves you and won’t completely betray you like that. In the meantime, she can go screw off. Just saying."
depression,fcxys9g,t3_ej91r7,1578072390.0,No you’re not annoying. You’re just human and they don’t like that. And they can promptly piss off.
depression,fcxfiyj,t3_ejamne,1578061596.0,Yup! All the time. And it’s the most frustrating feeling ever.
depression,fcxfhbb,t3_ejfpjp,1578061560.0,Good for you for being willing to share your experiences! I’m writing an online book on my feelings.
depression,fct7cfa,t3_eiq3q5,1577934796.0,Social media is a huge joke. Nothing more nothing less.
depression,fct7af4,t3_eiqkvo,1577934753.0,"Yeah. Last decade my parents got  divorced. And it’s been downhill since. So yeah, this “last decade” can go screw itself. I doubt the “new decade” will be any better."
depression,fct76xj,t3_eikclj,1577934678.0,I’m really sorry for your loss. Please don’t blame yourself. You did what you could and that’s what matters. Just give yourself the time needed to grief and to hopefully heal. Don’t spend it beating yourself up no matter how much you want to. It’ll only make things harder on you.
depression,fct18u5,t1_fct0roa,1577930257.0,Maybe write your feelings down? That way other people can’t judge you for it or you feel as though your burdening them.

depression,fct11tr,t3_eir6ra,1577930111.0,They don’t truly understand. And they don’t want to. Better to put up a front than put forth any real effort.
depression,fct0zdh,t3_eir5wa,1577930063.0,"Like you said, mediation or a journal could be beneficial. Better than bottling it up. Or therapy but I know that’s not in everybody’s means or comfort zone. But I’m the same way. I just drain the hours away by watching YouTube, endlessly scrolling through nonsense, I have nothing better to do nor do I desire to do anything else. And I don’t want to have to get out of bed and go out to do things even if they’re essential. I hate it. And I don’t want to sleep a lot of times now either cause I have bad dreams. But mainly cause I hate waking up. Though struggling to sleep at all sucks too."
depression,fct0nyt,t3_eir3ey,1577929832.0,Perhaps try finding some other way to get your feelings out?  Instead of on yourself?
depression,fct0kyk,t3_eir0xq,1577929770.0,You don’t have to say anything else. You said all that needed to be said.

Don’t listen to him. He clearly hates himself and is just projecting it onto you. That’s not your fault by any means. And that doesn’t make you a bad person."
depression,fcsfm79,t3_eihb6b,1577915829.0,Yup. I can’t relate to people’s lives in the sense that I’m not happy and don’t have a bunch of friends.
depression,fcsff8n,t3_eilyoo,1577915755.0,"Oh my god you just described me! I’m the “social butterfly” so to speak. I form relationships really easy. But maintaining them? That’s a whole different story. I may like the idea of having friends but at the same time I don’t want them contacting me anymore after like on visit. Like that’s physically all I had the energy and patience for. Though to be honest I feel like some friends have ghosted me first, or at least made me feel like, so I kind of responded the same way. If that makes sense.  I used to loving being around people and hated being alone. Now I revel in loneliness and can’t stand being around people! It’s mentally and emotionally draining for me to spend copious amounts of time with others. All I wanna do is stay in bed and listen to music. And I’m right there with you on people wondering what’s wrong with me. I can be happy one minute and go dead silent and feel miserable the next. Then people just look at me weirdly and wonder why they even bothered to include me in stuff. I can willingly say I relate to all of this on a spiritual level. And I don’t really know how to explain it either. Not that anybody would really understand."
depression,fcsek1o,t3_eiiddg,1577915420.0,My constant feelings. Summed up. Right here.
