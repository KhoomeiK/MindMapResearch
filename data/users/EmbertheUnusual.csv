AskReddit,ff5x4so,t3_ergjyj,1579613174.0,"I work at a gas station where people can either pay at the pump via card or come up to my kiosk window to prepay an amount. Standard stuff I imagine. One day, an older gentleman comes up and puts something like $50 on one of the pumps. Now since we are a part of a grocery store, we have a system in place where money spent inside the store can earn you fuel points if you use your member ship card.

So whatever, man uses his card and goes to pump, then comes back a few moments to complain that the pump isn't using all his fuel points. It happens sometimes, so I check it in my system. Nope, shows 20¢ off when he's insisting he has 30¢. After a bit of pointless yelling, he tells me he's going to go check this with his wife and drives off in a huff. Too bad, so sad.

Where it gets interesting is a maybe an hour and a half later, when Mr  No-Points pulls *back* into the station, right up to the same pump. Doesn't say a word to me, so I figure he's just decided to pay over there. Well lo and behold, he comes marching up to my kiosk window *demanding* to know why the pump isn't working. **Motherfucker thought we'd still have his gas money on that pump.** I tried explaining this to him, even showed him the void-transaction receipt and that his money had all gone directly back into his account, but he was having none of it, screaming as directly into my face about how he'll tell this to the management and get me fired. There's thick bulletproof glass between me and him, but I've never been the best at coping with people yelling at me, so my coworker Shawna (Thank God for her) goes out to calm him down and show him how to pay there while I stay inside and try not to cry.

Maybe not the worst thing that could have happened, but certainly not how I wanted to spend my day."

I'm not blaming the machines, or the people using them, that's just how it is.

My main issue here, as I stated above, is people (intentionally or not) failing to take that factor into account when deciding guilt, and simply assuming that the unblinking eye of the machine is 100% accurate.
