Bible,ffgfzmp,t1_ffg8qns,1579905377.0,"So why does EVERY Bible now read that ""His name is Jealous because He is a Jealous God? I know that's incorrect, it's etched upon my heart.Were all on the same team here I am just calling attention to something serious and I am not alone there 1000s more people doing the same thing as I type this very moment."
PS4,ffg103g,t3_et7d4r,1579896116.0,Im starting to think I will have to buy the anti-static vacuum.
PS4,ffg0uy6,t1_ffem6g7,1579896029.0,YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS! A LEAF BLOWER OR VACUUM CLEANER W/REVERSE MODE! WILL CAUSE A STATIC EXPLOSION INSIDE THE PS4! IM STARTING TO THINK YOUR SERIOUS! WARNING DO NOT FOLLOW THE ABOVE INSTRUCTIONS!
Bible,ffg0bew,t1_ffevzzl,1579895698.0,"Christ knocks on EVERYONE'S door to their heart. You simply opened the door and let Him in! The Lord redeemed you before even your mother turned away from Him. For He knows EVERYTHING....before it happens as well as after. You did not end up one of His flock by accident, you have a purpose for being here. For  many many years I have wondered what will my calling be? It appears I have been shown and I had wondered off into the world briefly....I apologized to God and asked Him to forgive me and show me the truth of His world not my own. Just two days ago I stumbled upon this knowledge so I myself am still reeling with amazement. Please stay in touch friend and let me know how you are faring or  your opinion  on this and/or find anymore crucial evidence. Shalome!"
BibleFrontToBack,fffzb72,t1_ffe0zag,1579895076.0,I know....I stated above it just DOESN'T EXIST NOW NOR EVER DID?
PS4,fffyzb4,t3_et7d4r,1579894873.0,Lungs lol. I would love to blow that dust out all by myself but A. Working in IT I kind of know better than to do that and B. Again I been warned that dust falling on the MOBO could cause the system to eventually brick.
Bible,ffem0mi,t1_ffef6gu,1579853817.0,"Sorry didnt mean to confuse you.
Do you believe Gods name is Jealous? Like do you believe if you pray to Him and refer to Him as ""JEALOUS"" that He will answer your prayers?"
PS4,ffelvfi,t3_et7d4r,1579853624.0,Yeah I have tried opening the cover and using q-tips with Iso alcohol and it helped a LITTLE for about 48 hours. Also Ive watched some videos about it and because the dust IS so bad ive been advised to get a static vaccum because if the dust falls into the PCB/Mobo it's will eventually lead to hardware failure. I was just wondering if a method exists that didnt cost $100 lol. At this point its getting so bad it's annoying to run while playing because I have to turn the volume up 2 to 3× after fan kicks in and it can give you a headache from the jet engine sound basting in your ear after 30 seconds of play.
Bible,ffekwoz,t1_ffee7bf,1579852358.0,"You sound like a true believer. It would appear that  people who are just presented with this news react to it in either one of two different ways, absolute astonishment or absolute denial. There is a large group of us believers who have grown up in and around the church. We grew up reciting these scriptures in church, throughout our days, and throughout our lives. The words of God are etched upon our hearts and we know them by memory. However, so far as I have investigated this phenomenon (which is also labeled as ""The Mandela Effect"") began approximately 5-10 years ago. The evidence is phenomenal to say the least. Let me provide you with a link explaining it a bit more. I pray God opens your eye and ears to hear in the name of Yeshua Hamashiach.

There is more evidence....I just found that ""consider the sparrows.....they toil not. Has been replaced with ""consider the Ravens"". I'm still wrapping my mind around all this as well. Here is a link to a blog that may help explain exactly what is going on. Shalome!

Bible,ffeeilf,t1_ffedddr,1579845022.0,"You agreed that Gods name is NOT jealous then kitty posted where the Bible shows indeed it is showing up as ""Jealous"" and you replied: Cool.
Why? 
You know in your heart His name
 is NOT ""JEALOUS"" .
You know if you cry His name as ""JEALOUS"" you will get no response or a rebuke. I pray in the name of Yeshua Hamashiach you have eyes to see and ears to hear friend. Godbless."
Bible,ffdtvs6,t1_ffb8pyb,1579828804.0,"How can you betray what is etched upon your heart?

Gods name is NOT nor EVER was Jealous!"
Bible,ffdqwzv,t3_esn8hm,1579826768.0,"I found the following site which explains what I am asking perfectly. If you want to be blessed with the truth then SEEK. If your content with the world then mock what is true and instead praise deception. This comes down to your very core beliefs. The Lord is gathering his remnant who will not turn away from Him.This is a genuine test from God and He wants to know.....where do you stand?

It seems people are on one side of the other regarding this.Your either on the side of Truth (what is etched into your hearts) or deceit ( believing only what you see). True believers will take a read over that blog and KNOW with a deep conviction that either that blog is wrong or something is REALLY wrong! Amos talks about a coming famine but not for food for the Word of God. Like I said this ALL pretty new to me as well BUT like 1000s of others I REFUSE to believe my memory and 1000s of others is just INCORRECT. Your memories are not mine we all have our own memories. 

If you still do not believe anything presented before you I genuinely  pray that God open your eyes and ears in the name of Yeshua Hamashiach and in the name of the Ruach Hakodesh. Shalome. Shalome."

BibleFrontToBack,ffdojrg,t1_ffcvavz,1579825277.0,"No apparently the Lion shall lay with the lamb NEVER existed all the way back to the greek sepugant translations. Apparently it NEVER existed but just Google the lion shall lay with the lamb and look at all the ""residual"" memory of that scripture.

facepalm,fevhpo1,t3_eqgbr4,1579397604.0,"My friend what brought you to such conclusions? Assuming your referencing the new testament, not the old as well, I can think of a few examples in which of the author of the gospels most certainly is known. Paul wrote most of the new testament, The Pauline letters to churches are the thirteen New Testament books that present Paul the Apostle as their author. Paul's epistles were sent to the churches and Paul was in direct contact  with other disciples. We also know John was the author of Revelation. May God bless you in Yeshua Hamashiach's name!"
