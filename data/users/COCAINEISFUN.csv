I feel exactly the same way. Obviously I wanted nothing more for things to have changed and gone well. For me to have been treated the way I deserved to be. Just like a normal human being. But I was left with no other options, back against the wall.

Everything else you said is completely relatable as well."

Yeah. It’s a sad reality that we all eventually come to. Once you get sick of it, get to your breaking point, and realize the aftermath doesn’t even matter. You cut them out. Take time to adjust to the boring monotonous life you have because they’re no longer causing chaos. Then slowly realize that the feeling is cathartic and you take as much time as you need to just breathe and sit in silence and tranquility."

He also plays the victim here, and puts it all back on to him when you say you want to give up. A normal and loving person would be trying to figure out how to make things work and look inwardly into themselves to see what they may be doing wrong. This person will never do that or understand that concept. A normal person wouldn’t turn it back on them instantly and throw a pity party for themselves about how everyone leaves them. Hmm, ever wonder why people leave you all the time? Couldn’t be YOU that’s the problem, huh? No. No way. The narcissism is astonishing.

But again; this is it. She’s on her own now. Going forward you need to give yourself time. You need to figure out what your needs are and how you can take care of them by yourself. You need to ask yourself why and how you ended up with someone like this and stayed for so long. (It’s hard to do and admit, hey I was with mine for almost a decade). You need to cut contact with this person.

CHIBears,fcnte4d,t1_fcns7q6,1577818050.0,"1.	Am I having a stroke? I literally laid out everything plain and simple for you, so what’s that supposed to mean, exactly? 

2.	You said Mitch is stupid. Where did I say Mitch wasn’t stupid? What’s your point even? I definitely don’t know you’re right, it’s still plain and simple to me what I’m trying to get across, and it’s easy to see how a troll here would have trouble understanding and using their brain. 
3.	You didn’t specifically say it was blind, but that’s what you insinuated. That someone got hired to do math and then randomly got placed with a kid with downs - the teacher had no idea they would get or who it was. It’s very ironic that you think I’m the idiot in all of this. Time to take a look in the mirror and maybe get some help since you seem angry and feel the need to randomly call names and ironically as you said in your own words “have a stroke”
4.	I didn’t JUST say college tape lmao way to sweep the other part of my statement under the rug. He had Mitch’s first NFL year as well to watch under John Fox. That’s the other important part of what I said 

The point I was arguing was that Nagy knew full well that Mitch was our QB for a while going forward. He had to go all in on the risk of Mitch. He knew a little bit about Mitch coming into all of it. Because of College AND NFL tape. Nagy was asked to go “all in” on Mitch. Nagy GUSHED ABOUT MITCH. Nagy was basically asked to come in and groom Mitch into a successful QB. Nagy knew all of that coming into this job. It should not have been a surprise or shock to Nagy that any of this would happen. Nagy is part of the reason to actually blame for some of Mitch’s struggles as well. Mitch is to blame for some too. 

I’ve seen tons of your comments and all you do is troll here and spit vitriol so I’m sorry I even gave you the slightest bit of attention that you so desperately need, but never again after this. I’m blocking you and I hope you get some help that you obviously need. I don’t even say that condescendingly."
CHIBears,fcnr95c,t1_fcnq7yh,1577816927.0,"The fuck you mean? What are you having trouble understanding? The point is that it was a risk he was willing to take. QB’s are one of the riskiest things in the league and hardest things to find. It’s always significantly harder to find a really good one VS a bad one. Nagy watched Mitch’s tape in college and in his first NFL year. 

Your point is really fucking stupid lol I’m sorry. You really think your math point makes sense? Holy shit, man. That’s completely different and it’s frustrating even trying to think of a way to lay that out for you to get you to understand why it is stupid.

Nagy took a job knowing he had to work with this specific candidate for a while and that it was the Bears choice. He knew it could end up this way. 

It wasn’t a blind audition with a giant surprise at the end like your scenario would have it be. 

“Gotta teach math OH SHIT RANDO KID WITH DOWNS” lmao that’s now how it was...at all."
CHIBears,fcnppqm,t1_fcnpf17,1577816102.0,"He had to have known there was a possibility Mitch could not be a good QB, that’s all there is to it. It was a risky job and he took it. 

It was his job to improve Mitch and so far he has failed."
CHIBears,fcno7o6,t1_fcm9rh4,1577815238.0,Exactly. And imo that’s shitty of the fans to boo like that.
CHIBears,fcnnlj3,t1_fcnjtam,1577814893.0,"It KIND of is “woe is me” to do that to Nagy. The excuse of “dream job” doesn’t mean he has to take it or that he didn’t know what to expect with Mitch. Pace specifically wanted someone that was “ALL IN” on Mitch. He knew what he was getting into, plain and simple. Nagy has also done a piss poor job at a lot of things and is partly the reason for SOME of Mitch’s struggles, IMO. So there’s that too. Nagy was brought in (knowingly) to try and improve Mitch. Essentially: Nagy dug his grave, now he’s going to have to lie in it. 

Also: Pace isn’t being stubborn, he’s answering a question and it’s being misconstrued by the media, as usual. Look at what actually took place instead.

No one but Ryan Pace knows what he’s actually going to do next year, but either way, most people here already assumed Mitch would be the 2020 starter because of a lot of reasons: money, not having other options that are significantly better, and one last string of hope for Mitch to figure it out in another year. 

All that being said, it’s still possible that Pace will sign someone for competition (Alex Smith, Newton, Dalton, Mariota, Bridgewater, ETC) or that he will draft another QB."
CHIBears,fcnhl09,t1_fcnd08s,1577811868.0,"Maybe because Nagy didn’t have to take the Bears job? He still knew who Trubisky was from draft analysis with the Chiefs and from watching him his first year. 

Nagy knew full and well what he was getting into with the Bears and Mitch Trubisky. Mitch was our first round draft pick, we were going to ride or die with this kid and Nagy had the choice to take that job or not. Let’s not turn this into a “woe is me” for Nagy now."
CHIBears,fcn6qu4,t1_fcmvxl8,1577804726.0,"Cutler was a better looking QB in Denver than Chicago who made the Pro Bowl. Cutler was a very young QB at the time who had the potential to improve and become a better QB. 

The Chicago Bears did everything humanly possible to make sure that the growth would be impossible. Now, we’ll never know if he could have got better in a better situation (he probably would have), but my point is that he was put into mostly shitty situations with the Bears and we built up bad habits for him. 

I was a Cutler supporter for a while, because again, I could see the flaws most of the time in all of our other offensive issues that were almost always there. He was not without fault, like Trubisky. But at the time of Cutler leaving, I did think it was best to cut ties at that point of his career. Before I knew we would get Glennon, that is. I’d rather have kept Jay at that point. I just wish we handled his AND Trubisky’s career differently. 

My main point is how great of a job the Chicago Bears look at being stupid and inept as shit when it comes to doing the right things with developing quarterbacks. And I was not someone who thought he would light it up in Miami lmao anyone who thought that was dumb based on his long history and Miami being trash anyway."
CHIBears,fcn61s5,t1_fcn1116,1577804215.0,"No I’m not.

Some of us are just very passionate, do a lot for people, and don’t realize that we’re overdoing it. All this while not giving ourselves anything. We don’t satisfy our own needs, because we’re too busy trying to fulfill everyone else’s needs. We then expect other people to do the same and give just as much effort or almost as much, to make up for the fact that we ourselves don’t give it to ourselves. We do all this while not realizing that most other people can’t take care of so many things for us in the same way that we do for others. Everyone’s different, just because they don’t show love in the same way that we do, it doesn’t mean that the love is not there.

Acting like picking Mitch was insane and outlandish is just not true. Picking Mahomes would have been, though. Unfortunately, in hindsight, that would have been the right pick.

But if someone is passionate enough about something I’ll listen to them talk about it all day, it’s fun learning about new things and why people love something. I think that’s why some women enjoy being friends with me, because as an INFJ, I can easily understand why they enjoy what they do and talk and listen about it with them and relate more. 

I like to longboard, travel and visit new places (national park/state parks most of all), I love the ocean even though I live kind of far from it (5 hours), photography, I love watching and talking about my Chicago Bears and Cubs, Soccer (I played) I like sneakers and have a pretty big collection. Clothing shopping, hot sauces and trying new foods. I love watching stuff on YouTube like people who build their own homes inside of vans, or watching people who go out and fish different fishing spots, watching people camp on YouTube. I find it calming and watch all that at night time all the time. 

An example though is that my ex loved makeup, and I listened to her talk about it all the time so I paid attention and would watch makeup YouTube videos with her and I started to get into it! Lol. There’s so much that goes into all of it and I found it interesting. Not enough for me to try putting it on myself, but I’ll notice women’s makeup way more often now and give way more compliments when I notice they did a good job or put a lot of work into it. I can even talk about it still with anyone and even give recommendations on what products to use, etc. 

It’s nice to know I’m not alone, Reddit has helped me tremendously with that. There’s lots of things in my life that have made me feel like I’m the only one, but this place reminds me that I’m not. It’s a better feeling knowing there’s others out there who have similar experiences and thought processes. 

What kinds of things do you and your boyfriend enjoy doing?

Edit: and thanks for the pep talk. I just realized INFJ is my MBTI, I’ve taken it a long time ago but I didn’t remember or take seriously what I got.

It’s a rough life because a lot of women (romantically) I think wish I was more “manly” or rough and tough...ugh, idk. And I don’t make friends with as many men because I find them to usually be too...idk. Emotionally closed off? Degrading towards women, etc. 

That’s a big thing that bothers me is how majority of men talk about women when no women are around. It happens often and it’s not talked about.

That’s all very interesting about the intuition. Then when you really start to think about it, it’s good and important for society that different personality types exist so that we can be productive and have different types of people doing different types of things.

AmItheAsshole,fccrmjx,t1_fcclrzi,1577601818.0,That’s a device replacement. They do not repair the display or put a new one on. They give you a brand new device at that price and keep your broken device.

What, you think everyone else is a dumb idiot and you have it all figured out? Lol. Cmon man. 

Think of it this way. Other QB’s have had good OL’s and still haven’t been as dominant, consistent, or clutch as Tom Brady. Talk about the clutchest motherfucker. 

Tom Brady is an amazing football player who makes beautiful throws, has amazing pocket presence and has one of the highest football IQ’s. 

I’m not trying to be a dick, either, I swear. Spend some time listening to Tom talk about football and you’ll understand how smart he is too."

Rex had the potential to go torch a defense at times, and I believe to this day it was worth it for the Super Bowl to see if good Rex would show up.

Honestly it was a lose-lose for the Bears because we probably would have lost with Griese anyway. And can you imagine all of the people bitching and saying we should have put Rex in it we lost?"

Please do Sherrick McManis, he’s one of my favorite bears for being amazingly underrated. Hard worker. Great special teams player that also did a great job filling in for injuries.

He’s been with us for so long and given us so much without ever complaining, bad mouthing, etc. He’s been a consistently bright little star on our team."
