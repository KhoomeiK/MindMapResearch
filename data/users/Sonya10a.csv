xxfitness,ff6ujiz,t1_ff6okw7,1579635167.0,"Thank you :) one other question I had about your routine: are the sets/reps/weights the same you started as or did you increase over time? If they are the same, are you planning on increasing over time so you don't plateau or just keeping it same intensity because you are maintaining?"
xxfitness,ff6miv4,t3_erx96l,1579630373.0,"I'm 5'3 between 109-112lbs (depending on the scale) and eat a lot less than you and look flabby. You look amazing! I think your abs were great even in summer 2019. 

I'm following a machine based workout for a few months but am saving this post in case I want to switch to your routine. I also only workout 3x a week for an hour. 

Thank you for your detailed post."

bipolar,ff4tmz1,t3_erngid,1579572164.0,"2 years and 3 months...on Haldol 2mg now. Last time the streak broke, was due to international trip with 9 hour time difference that made it impossible to sleep for more than 1 hour a night. After 4 nights of that, I was paranoid. Now I always travel with backup emergency meds (zyprexa to knock me out). Lesson learned the hard way!"
AmateurRoomPorn,ff4lq6k,t3_erl3bk,1579566660.0,Love the vanity table and mirror. Do they come in a set or were purchased separately? And how do you keep it so minimalist...my dresser is littered with skincare and makeup lol
bipolar,ff4l7j8,t3_erhyit,1579566307.0,"OP is lowering meds, not stopping them completely. After 10 years of stability, I think that is reasonable. Congrats on 10 years! I am a little jealous lol I've reduced my meds from the highest dose I took at an acute manic phase to about half that dose at maintenance. And that was after 2 years of stability only. 

Without knowing the specifics of the meds and dosage, the only advice I can give is to carefully monitor your triggers the next few weeks and have emergency medicine to take as needed if symptoms do arise."
bipolar,fephrj5,t3_eq8nlf,1579320824.0,"Your experience will depend a lot on dosage. I was on a high 20mg dose of Zyprexa for a year after my first episode and I was a zombie. Gained a lot of weight too (for me). I'm still bitter about it and this early experience led to a lot of mistrust of psychiatrists and meds in general. 

Seroquel I was on for years at high and medium doses (800mg slowly decreased to maintain at 400). I had 0 weight gain or other side effects except I tended to oversleep a lot. In the end, it didn't prevent mania for me and started messing with my heart rhythm.

Now, I have 5mg of Zyprexa as a back up, emergency medicine if shit hits the fan. It's perfect for that because if I ever take it, I will fall right asleep and wake up not manic or psychotic. But I've only had to use it once or twice this way fortunately. I'm not sure I'd reccomend as a daily drug but I'm a little biased by my horrible experience of 20mg for a year. No doubt it is very effective at making someone sane, but also might take the joy and light out of life. And you will want to eat everything in sight."
bipolar,fep8ioz,t3_eq6jyv,1579314522.0,Messed with my thyroid after a few months and gave me a lot of body acne. I noped after that.
loseit,feoklay,t3_eq0jqz,1579301475.0,"I get comments from my family all the time how I should be eating more and I'm too thin blah blah. I'm 112 lbs and maintaining that for over a year (need to update the flair). I still have lower belly fat for crying out loud! And fat on my arms and thighs and butt.

bipolar,feirj0j,t3_epd1oh,1579145391.0,"College was horrible for me, took me like 10 years to graduate but that was with forced medical leaves lasting 1-2 years at a time and an Ivy League culture that wouldn't let me attend part-time. I eventually graduated and work has been wonderful. I thrive on routine and it creates stability. I wish I could tell myself that in my 20s but it would've been hard to have a structured life on campus."
hisdarkmaterials,feifgna,t3_epae6p,1579137289.0,I'm fine waiting as long as Season 3 does get made. This article is encouraging.
SkincareAddiction,feibk89,t3_eovthq,1579134666.0,Amlactin twice a day plus physical exfoliation every day plus vitamin c plus niacinamide plus dermarolling seems like way too much irritation even tho I'm sure leg skin is thicker than face skin.

bipolar,fdzsu7u,t1_fdxjjbe,1578794983.0,Wow can you say more about the excel journal? I'm intrigued!
bipolar,fdzsfry,t3_engkzb,1578794708.0,"I'm so sorry you're going thru this. Years ago I ran out of my med, Seroquel, and did not have a doctor. I went to an ER that had a psych crisis team and psych ward. I explained myself and was admitted to the ER psych ward (they just patted me down as is procedure for them) and seen by a psych. She gave me a prescription for Seroquel with one refill and made me an outpatient appointment so this wouldn't happen again. I think the hospital was able to look up my records from a hospital I had been inpatient at so that helped back up my story."
bipolar,fdzrsab,t3_enayaq,1578794282.0,I wish you the best! I'm not pregnant but am considering it someday if I ever find the right guy to be my rock through it. I wouldn't want to be on any meds during and would only consider the whole ordeal if I've been stable for a few years prior.

bipolar,fdzpuvp,t3_enf1ic,1578793069.0,"Yes...I've had some psychotic episodes where I remember everything and others where I have blacked out a lot of stuff, mostly due to strong tranquilizers."
bipolar,fdzd6ue,t1_fdxl22u,1578789077.0,Thanks I will be getting those foods lol! I saw the NP today and told her the names of the IV drugs and she wasn't in the least concerned :)
bipolar,fdwoase,t3_en6djk,1578760795.0,"Everyone reacts differently...I had 0 weight gain with Seroquel and I was on 800mg for a few months after hospitalization. Eventually went down to 400mg for a few years and no weight gain. However in the end it wasn't effective in curbing my mania and psychosis.


I'm on Haldol 2.5mg now, down from 5mg. I had about 25 pound weight gain when I first started but was able to lose it by limiting portion sizes. I'm a petite woman however and was bordering on underweight for a lot of my life. I had a super fast metabolism and never had to watch what I eat till now."
SkincareAddiction,fdt405h,t1_fdsq12j,1578711621.0,Excellent comment! I think the CosRX BHA toner is not salicylic acid that's the only one I can think of off hand.
bipolar,fdt0ech,t1_fdsq8rp,1578710300.0,"Zyprexa is great for sleep. I have it on hand to use just in case I'm feeling manic symptoms. Short term use is fine, weight gain is only a major issue using it for a prolonged period."
AlexandraQuick,fdqluo7,t1_fdqlcxg,1578669759.0,That's what I thought too! Now I want to know what Larry's potion smelled like.
bipolar,fdpdkh7,t1_fdp5x3k,1578625913.0,"Thank you! The oral surgeon had never come across a patient developing psychosis due to the surgery and he strongly recommended I do not forgo the sedation. As for my psych doc (technically nurse practitioner), I am seeing her in a few days and will bring up the upcoming surgery and my concerns. Hopefully she will recommend a plan in case the worst happens."
bipolar,fdonrl1,t1_fdohkjb,1578608918.0,"I'm 100% sure it's not ketamine, I would've remembered that lol. Thank you tho, I will call and ask the names of all the drugs they are using for the IV sedation (in retrospect I should've taken notes during the consultation)."
bipolar,fdoni8z,t1_fdohbrd,1578608763.0,"First step is being stable/in full remission. If you don't have that as a base, it'll be hard to separate happy emotions from mania. Once you have some stability for a period, working on goals is a guaranteed way to feel happy, for me at least."
bipolar,fdoh8mo,t3_emg5k6,1578605100.0,"I've been happy and not manic. Manic happiness is an unstable euphoria like feeling. For me, true everyday, daily kind of happiness is calm, peaceful, and purposeful."
bipolar,fdoeft9,t1_fdodxjx,1578603593.0,"I've never had surgery in the past for anything so have never needed IV sedation or anesthesia. However there is research that indicates people with BP or schizophrenia can have psychosis after general anesthesia, and in fact the risk for psychosis even exists, although smaller, for someone with no mental illness. Knowing that is what prompted my fears and question. I'm on mobile but if you google ""anesthesia and psychosis"" you'll see articles."

bipolar,fdnzh0h,t3_emcq9h,1578595992.0,"This is really interesting, thanks for sharing. Can confirm, regular sleep schedule is like over 50% of the battle for me."
bipolar,fdni5ag,t1_fdnacnx,1578586301.0,"Agree. Although sometimes you get lucky. For example, I was on Seroquel for years with 0 weight gain and no other side effects except low blood pressure in the mornings. And I was on a mid range dose of 400mg (800mg immediately after mania and psychosis). Long term it started affecting my heart rhythm (elongated qt interval) and just didn't work to prevent mania.

The best you can do is go for the lowest effective dose. I'm now on 2.5 mg haldol, down from 5mg. It did cause weight gain of about 25 pounds initially but I was able to lose it by watching my calories (previously I was one of those skinny ppl that never had to worry about how much I ate). 

It sucks but trial and error is your best bet OP. Every medicine affects everyone differently."
xxfitness,fdnfpng,t1_fdm56fg,1578584830.0,"Glad to help! I am on week 2 and my arms are always sore (in a good way). Also I should add I supplement this machine workout with planks, squats, and pushup progression but that's because of my personal goals."

xxfitness,fdm30lz,t3_em244r,1578538602.0,"Hi, I'm also a beginner choosing to do machine workouts for now as I build some basic strength. I couldn't do the routine in the wiki because my gym lacks a lot of those machines. You got some good answers for substitutes so maybe you can make it work.

bipolar,fdfp4tj,t3_eky2hm,1578366860.0,"College was hell for me, and I still have nightmares to this day. I had my first episode/hospitalization at 17 during my first semester and was forced by my college to take a medical leave of absence for a year. Multiple hospitalizations and leaves later, I graduated like 7 years late :( My school was hard to work with, an Ivy League that thought too highly of itself with heartless beaurocrats. If I could do it over, I would go to a state school where at least I would have the option of a part time schedule. I would also register with and use the services of the disability office, something I regret not doing. Finally, I would think very carefully about taking an Incomplete/extension. I found completing overdue papers even with extensions to be nigh impossible. 

All that doom and gloom aside, I did it and am now stable for years and have a decent career. So there is light at the end. Learn from my mistakes. And even if you make your own mistakes, just don't give up. Now that I'm working, no one else cares that it took me like 10 years (gahhh) for an undergraduate degree."
bipolar,fdfn6zi,t3_el4ryd,1578365581.0,"I took the dissolving version of zyprexa ages ago after my first episode. I am not a doctor or pharmacist but my thinking is even if you swallowed it, it would dissolve in your throat, esophagus or stomach. So you are getting the dose. I would wait it out. It should work quickly to put you to sleep (depending on the dose but zyprexa was very sedating for me). Good luck!"
bipolar,fdf1jir,t1_fdet74e,1578351206.0,Haha ok makes sense. I figured it was pets/children related. I like how organized your chore chart is too! And is it laminated? I'd be curious to see the full chart because I struggle with scheduling regular chores. I'm currently using Goal Tracker app to track some habits/chores.

I was thinking of just starting with wide leg bodyweight squats because I find it hard to get my thighs parallel with the floor. So working on that till I build up more strength.

Is that a good full body workout for a beginner? I still have to make substitutions for the Leg Press and Lying Leg Curl-- is doing bodyweight squats, Seated Leg Cur, and Leg Extension a good substitute?"
