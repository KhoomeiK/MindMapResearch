How did that come across as anything hurtful escapes me."

Not sure what else you define as science.

Similar research papers can be searched for
Vastu, Feng shui etc as well. Vastu literally translates to science of architecture.  
  
Anyways, be curious, ignorance ain't always bliss."
india,fghsw3s,t1_fgffu8p,1580792908.0,"Vaastu and homeopathy.  
Not that I follow any of the two, but there's actually science involved behind them.  
Placebo, in itself, is known to bring about increased neural activity, release of hormones, psychological and physiological changes in the body helping to cure certain ailments.  
  
Yes, there's a lot of sham as in any other industry, some dispute and unknown. Nothing's outright though.  
  
A bit more reading apart from thinned down news articles, Wikipedia or quora should help."

Comes across as a great act supported by well synchronised music and eye contact.  
  
So wholesome!"

Cricket,fg9p1pm,t3_exmgz2,1580641569.0,Looks like a couple of Indian aunts gossiping and then there's a pesky one intruding who's  responsible for public awareness of the said gossip.

Cricket,fg03837,t1_ffzzcbd,1580399227.0,"Absolutely. The profile of the tournament will be raised due to the addition of such a marquee name. Will also help in grabbing more eyeballs on and off the ground, and there's increased broadcast rights as well."

rarepuppers,ffsidbo,t3_eutktu,1580182430.0,"A dog jumping over their humans who are happy to lovingly squish him and there are people who are judging that the dog needs better training and the humans are irresponsible. With no context absolutely.  
  
I don't see the dog **harming** anyone, if at all, except their owners. If the dog does that to strangers repeatedly, maybe then you have a point. But you don't know that, do you?  
  
Ohh and btw how about the times when humans get happy and mistakenly shove an elbow, step on ur foot, accidentally hurt someone etc ? But if a dog does that, let's start judging everyone we can, including the dog!  
Awesome! You guys really need to get a life and maybe some preprogrammed robots.  
  
On a side note, the dog is such a goofie ! :)"
tennis,ffq7xcq,t1_ffq4inb,1580125136.0,"Absolutely true. It can't be black and white.  
That being said, the same stands true when he's symbolized in absolute terms ""as being a good person"".  
  
Don't you think his behaviour with others, swearing at officials and umpires, shouting at ball boys, disrespecting opponents, tanking etc also has to be taken into account while judging him as a person ?  
  
(I don't mind what he says to himself, his team or does to his racket etc).  

Yes, he seems fun, has a kind heart and all of those things. But he's also not the person you make him out to be.
  
As you said, it ain't just black and white."

Cricket,fcdpvzt,t1_fcchhyp,1577612392.0,"Actually not much about his action.  
In the article, Ishant mentions that instead of hitting full length cones in practice, Gillespie urged him to hit the batsman's pads below the knee roll no matter where it pitches.  
  
Brilliant piece though."
