Accuracy. I tested the numbers for Finland, and your calculator gives a net salary that is too low compared to [the official calculator](https://www.vero.fi/en/individuals/tax-cards-and-tax-returns/tax_card/tax-percentage-calculator/)

Using the default income of 45kE, the tax rate is 20% in Espoo (the tax rate is dependent on the municipality), for a net-of-tax income of 36kE. However, there are also mandatory deductions: a pension deduction of 7.15% and an unemployment insurance deduction of 1.25%. In total, this would result in tax-like rate of 28.4%, or a total net income of about 32kE. The calculator shows a net income of 28236, i.e. 12% less than the real one (an even then that 7.15% shouldn't probably be counted as a tax given that most Americans wouldn't count 401k deductions as tax). Thus, the comparable net income is somewhere between 32 and 36 thousand euros.

immigration,feji0e1,t3_ephv8l,1579175134.0,"> Does having 10 co-authored publications, with 200+ citations in total, in non-STEM fields, qualify one for filing a “self-petition” on the USCIS I-140 form?

What I heard when I filed my EB was that you need at least a couple of first author publications. 200+ citations in total are enough, but you need at least 10-20 or so non-self-citations from your first author publications.

> If successful, are you supposed to work exclusively in your field once in the US?

You are supposed to, but USCIS considers this fulfilled after you work on the field for about 6 months after getting the green card.

Edit: I also want to mention that most EB1/EB2 NIW petitioners should strongly consider using a lawyer due to how heavy the process is. A lawyer specializing in these petitions will also have a very good idea on what the chances are."
Physics,feh6ncc,t1_feh0qlk,1579110251.0,"European high school curriculum is typically more advanced than the US equivalent, and in the US half of the college degree consists of ""general"" classes whereas (at least in Finland) EU students start with major classes on the first day. In Finland there's also a selection to a specific program (instead of just general admissions to a given university), so the program can admit only candidates who are already at a high level after high school.
