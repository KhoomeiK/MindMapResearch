aww,fdaf2xo,t3_ekb1r3,1578245356.0,"That looks exactly like my GINGER cat named TOBY and, it wasn't ""mine"" but i found him outside, and i had to bottle feed him. He looked only 2-3 weeks old..? And he wouldnt eat. But he started to. I thought about adopting him (Alot even though im allergic) but i can take medicine for my allergy  anyway he was getting better, but ONE night later... He died in my arms. He was so young... 💔 love you tobes. Happy 2020. Toby 2018-2018"
