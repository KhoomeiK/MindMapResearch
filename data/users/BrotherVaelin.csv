blursedimages,ffhvdgg,t1_ffhv7ld,1579955658.0,My bad. That last bit made no sense to me. All the caps and lower case lettering threw me off. I don’t understand teenagers’ ways of internet communication. But I have met some Americans who genuinely thought they won the Vietnam war.

Imagine living in a country with a state that has had lead polluted water since 2014 and the guy who did it never saw a day in jail. Imagine having the ability and weaponry to contribute to the removal of a tyrannical government and not doing so. The US government has a strangle hold on the people and you refuse to see it, Stockholm syndrome at its finest"
