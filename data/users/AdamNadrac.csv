https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/self-help/feeling-good/

There are countless red flags in your text. 

I know a lot of us here are lonely and depressed > generalization, self diagnosis in the present tense, because you self identify as lonely and depressed that is who you are. You brain can't tell the difference between right and wrong, just goes in the direction you tell it to.

but I'm honestly at loss at how to deal with it > Disempowering defeatist attitude with emotional reasoning, under the guise of genuine logical conclusion 

I've literally exhausted all my options > You only say that to feel good by avoiding personal responsibility, but you completely disempower yourself with that statement. Taking responsibility is taking control. 

tried > trying is doing with the intention of giving up, basically an excuse

I can go on, the good news is you may feel lost right now, but you are going to get better, the more you question your emotions to more you gain control over them. 

Don't think of yourself as depressed, from this point on you are committed to your mental health for life. I know you can do it because i have done it, 10 years ago i wrote crazier crap than that, but these days i struggle to recall how it felt."

INTP,ff6zmip,t1_ff5xk9y,1579638161.0,"Basically you are talking about gamifying your tasks, trying to tap into intrinsic motivation but also very much using extrinsic motivation, which only works if you reward yourself often.

You are not wrong by trying to do everything faster, it's a good way to not change a task but still make it more engaging, fox example i am bored when watching videos, but watching videos at 2.5x is very engaging, and i do believe intps are very much into efficiency. 

Of course this feedback loop of you enjoying the activity more and rewarding yourself builds habits, which makes these activities easier to keep going.

How do you reward yourself? 

Isn't the reward ever distracting, making returning to your task difficult?

How did you arriwe at this this system?

Do you use anything other than time to make your tasks more enjoyable?

Maybe a less public date is a good idea, so he doesn't have to worry about being judged by others. Food is definitely a good idea because eating relaxes people, that's why comfort eating is a thing.

Be specific because vague labels confuse us, like you say romantic, i have no idea what you mean. You say date, i can only speculate what that means to you, but if you say you are coming over with a pizza and we are watching a certain movie that is clear. If you say you like me, my first thought would be why? It's not a low confidence thing, but trying to make sense of it. 

It's best to communicate in a way that doesn't require further clarification, because that adds confusion. I don't really have a Flirt move either. I am playful and share knowledge when i am comfortable but i do that with everyone, sounds like he is doing that with you + attraction = flirting.
