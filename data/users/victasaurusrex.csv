WhitePeopleTwitter,fgq3sez,t3_ezr9kb,1581017330.0,This is why I had to ask my boss to give me more info when she sends me a Skype message. “Please come see me” or “come to my office please” with no context just gives me undue anxiety. She was gracious about it and now writes “please come see me about x.”

politics,fg4z4gb,t3_ewwdrq,1580514384.0,So much for “constitutional conservatives.”  Democracy = undermined and steadily eroding.

AskReddit,ff8l357,t3_es8odk,1579683714.0,"I was around 14 or 15 and I drank Fundador brandy—the very first liquor I’ve had. One night when my parents were asleep, I just decided to drink some of my dad’s brandy to know how much I could handle and how it felt to be buzzed. I remember laughing so hard for a while."

Edit: I suppose the level of pain also depends on how much needs to be fixed. I also had some permanent teeth removed as my mouth was apparently overcrowded."

aww,fdi3s3b,t3_elhjpf,1578435222.0,Teared up at work. I remember when my dad gave me my first guitar at 11. This instrument will be a great source of inspiration and I’m excited for her.
