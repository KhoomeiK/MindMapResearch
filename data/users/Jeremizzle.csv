Some of Nintendo’s most beloved games have been on those systems. 

Even for home consoles, the switch is more powerful than any of Nintendos’s previous machines. None of them have had HDR, so I don’t know what that has to do with the vibrant designs and colour drenched worlds you mentioned. They’re still there. I play 99% handheld, and I don’t know how you can call Mario odyssey or Luigi’s mansion 3 washed out and pale. It’s up to an individual game if it chooses to look like that."

The games really can look a lot better on CRT sometimes, especially “realistic” games.  It’s almost like a form of anti aliasing, the ultra sharp pixelated look is more indicative of the HD era with high res displays. 

That said, I actually like the sharp look, and have no desire to buy a bulky CRT just for some retro gaming. I was already there for it when it was current tech. More power to the people that do though, there’s definitely benefit beyond just the “authentic experience”."
