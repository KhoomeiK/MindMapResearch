news,fe3i05p,t1_fdxrxzd,1578849402.0,"Its just people trying to distance themselves from people who do heinous acts. Every time you see a post like this you usually see people calling them mentally ill, doing it for power, because of poverty(usually towards minorities). And its mainly because both sides benefit from this. people reading this will feel comforted knowing their neighbor or family members will never be as mentally ill as a criminal. And the accused can deflect a portion of the blame off of them for a lighter sentence. If i did something the last person I'm blaming is myself."
