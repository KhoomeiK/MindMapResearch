gaming,ff3ifrf,t3_ergacx,1579541720.0,"I have no idea about the Mac but if you like dnd and donâ€™t mind older games get baldurs gate I and II, newer variants are divinity original sin 1 or pillars of eternity. If u want to play a traditional rpg those will get you more than enough playtime."
TwoXSex,fervz2c,t1_fdo9jfq,1579358941.0,"This weirdly happens to me after long and exhausting sex sessions. Like, right when I roll over I stop breathing until I realize I was holding my breath unintentionally for a minute. Anyone else? 29 m"
ffxi,feoq00v,t1_feop714,1579303792.0,Thanks I did not know that. I started with the xbox 360 beta in Europe.  I had access to those sites when starting. I can hardly imagine how it felt to play without those informations.
ffxi,feoof5s,t1_feo59vg,1579303026.0,Fair point no reason to downvote me tho.
ffxi,femiqtz,t3_epwhln,1579257660.0, I don't but why does it matter? Everything in both of them is outdated and probably better covered in online guide. If u need it for a 75 sever old stuff can be found online aswell

TwoXSex,fdk8h19,t1_fdk5crf,1578498467.0,"I think that's a horrible advice which could lead to someone getting hurt. Be honest about how you feel. It will get even harder once you have kids. Since you guys are good at communicating, talk about it, try some new stuff alone and with him and repeat.  Good luck."
sex,fd9jrpl,t3_efaem7,1578234322.0,"I am in a somewhat similar situation but I want my gf to be the dominant one, which she isn't comfortable to be. We recently  tried some light roleplaying and it worked out way better than i had expected. We basically set one rule for us which was I had to ask for permission  for everything and she had the power to order me to do anything. If I was to slow or couldn't follow her orders or did anything without  asking, she would slap me as punishment. When ever I felt like she didn't know what to do I would ask permission to do something,  so she had the power to deny me and to let her know/guess what I would like to do next. Maybe you can try something similar. Set your own rules and experiment.  Have fun."
ffxi,fcwvnka,t3_ejavt5,1578039528.0,"Go to bg Wiki and look at the capacity points page. You get permanent CP boni for finishing missions or finishing some alduin stuff, also get all the cp rings + a Cape. The gear and accuracy you are going to need was already answered. Good luck."
facepalm,fcrggv6,t1_fcr76wz,1577901506.0,Yeah seriously send them yo us! Destroying brand new Lego.... this is a double facepalm
facepalm,fcr50y5,t1_fcr1p7u,1577896867.0,No way! Proof?
facepalm,fcr1ozg,t1_fcqb80c,1577895481.0,OP is completely on point here. If an adult thinks he/she should not have any sexuality  to be a good role model something went very wrong. Religious or not!

FinalFantasy,fcg587q,t1_fcg4u74,1577636588.0,Not even on ps2 or xbox 360 anymore. Its PC only now and this will most certainly stay this way. However u can still play with a gamepad.
FinalFantasy,fcg4oz3,t1_fceancr,1577636426.0,"Yes they are! Montly Updates aswell, however they will not develop any new expansions anymore. The biggest server has 2000+ online at all times, the smaller ones have 200-500. Check it out, iam having a blast replaying and meeting old friends, found some ppl I played the beta with!"
FinalFantasy,fcagv9x,t1_fcagci3,1577569014.0,"Most of the storyconent is soloable, with the help of NPC party members. The endgame is another story. But you can enjoy the story without the need of any other players. Some grinding needs to be done tho. There are alot of great storylines in FFXI."
educationalgifs,fc9sx5t,t3_egem46,1577557735.0,Can anyone tell me by how much the video is slowed down? It looks like half of the normal speed. And is the movement of the fire slowed down by the water or is it  just  getting pushed back? Or both? Sorry for my English..
FinalFantasy,fc9ci2a,t1_fc8vywj,1577550530.0,Did u ever consider trying XI ? Even though it's a morph it is still very much a FF game and now u can play the fantastic story 99% solo or duo with your big. Check the ffxi sub if you decide to give it a go.
ffxi,fc99sf0,t1_fc98rmj,1577549348.0,"This sub has so many quality answers, thanks to all of you. Inresting read! *flush*"
facepalm,fc3goea,t1_fc3esz1,1577389397.0,I don't think that OP would know why you would have a reason to do so.
ffxi,fbk84zz,t1_fbk45s1,1576946248.0,The only thing I remember reading was GM Dave's blog. It was a blast. Could you share some other fan media which you remember? I can search for myself if it's still out there.
