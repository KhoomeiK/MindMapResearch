To get them to back off calling for Bolton to testify.  Biden is a sham witness. He's a red herring, a distraction.  Nothing more.

It does, though, because the only point of calling Hunter Biden is to, as someone else said, ""use the floor of the Senate to do to Joe Biden what the Ukraine could not.""  The Democrats don't want Hunter Biden called because they don't want to give the Republicans that opportunity, not because it hurts their case (it doesn't).
