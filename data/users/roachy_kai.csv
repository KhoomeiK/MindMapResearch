nba,feb5mdq,t1_feaxx4u,1578955664.0,I said Playmaking Bigs.
nba,feb5hlw,t1_feayefu,1578955625.0,"I mean he's no Shaq or Wilt Chamberlain. A traditional center that's what I meant, someone who dominates the paint with ease and pure strength. See I don't think Jokic would be a Superstar then when Bigs ran the league but I think he's perfect in today's modern basketball. But you're right lol he's not but he is smart and knows how to play the game know how to play how basketball is being played today. Right place right time."
nba,feb4wnd,t1_feb14er,1578955437.0,"Well if you were to tell a basketball fanatic from the 90's that most Big Men will be shooting threes, the post game is obsolete, or the mid range is dead in the future... They'd think your crazy. Even I had to come to accept this fact that this exist. Now don't you think it's possible having big men already playmaking?"
nba,feaxu9z,t1_feauwq1,1578953333.0,"Lol, well maybe not IT but hope you know what I mean."
nba,fea8h5x,t1_fe9l2f1,1578945603.0,I can only take Greg Pop seriously when he's on the court.
nba,fea89n4,t1_fe9qe1q,1578945528.0,You missed the chance to say Creampie Monday
nba,fea82or,t3_eo65kv,1578945461.0,"Lol, that's Pop for you."
offmychest,fea7kid,t1_fe8v4mf,1578945289.0,All beings needs and deserve love. Even dogs. They love you just as much.
offmychest,fea7cok,t3_eo3jcy,1578945212.0,"Your life is not worth losing. You don't need to know me to take my word for it. Sure I don't have a wife, a dog, or be an alcoholic to understand but.... It's the ultimate experience living on Earth and living life. You live, you learn, you prosper. At least give your offsprings a chance to learn from your mistakes to better themselves and your future grandkids. Maybe your life isn't worth it but to someone else, it is. Try something new, it's never to late to change directions. Just don't do it to yourself, you control you're own life. Control what you can."
NBA2k,fddukmh,t1_fddg4e9,1578324345.0,"Sorry didn't answer your second question dude. Uhm, I dont think so... I'm pretty sure in a way the game will give the same amount of badges you can own, idk tbh but for a single skill like playmaking as a secondary, sure. I can't really say you get more badges (don't care for them anyways, just as long as I can have some) but max is 30 isn't it? Thanks again and sftlr."
NBA2k,fddrv2e,t1_fddkksp,1578322353.0,Thank you!
NBA2k,fddhi76,t1_fddhgkh,1578312502.0,I'll experiment with it. Don't fully agree but I'll take it and thanks!
NBA2k,fddhd88,t1_fddg4e9,1578312333.0,Literally just started now.
NBA2k,fddhcs9,t1_fddg6l3,1578312317.0,Thank you! I think i got like 5 maybe less. But good advice.
nba,fct2p2t,t1_fcsasu7,1577931316.0,The Kawhi and his Raptors clapped the so called Greek Freak (Demi God) so idk what to believe in anymore.
nba,fcrcoqt,t1_fcr531f,1577900051.0,Nobody listens on anything other social platform so why not post it here.
nba,fcrcbni,t3_eik40d,1577899913.0,"I'm just saying gang, don't be surprised if you see the Pacers in the ECF against teams like the Bucks, 76ers, Heat, or even the Raptors. Maybe it's another What If story but if they can do this much without him, what can we expect in the future with him if not injury being the biggest issue?"
nba,fcrbgtg,t1_fcr35nw,1577899544.0,Boo
offmychest,fc49380,t3_efvdyw,1577409953.0,"I'd cry if my friends had photos of me in their home. I'm a dude which makes photos with them just a little weird plus I don't hang photos in my house, idk maybe this is a guy thing. Not much photos hung in my house at least, only my immediate family. To me he's my best friend, to them he's a stranger. I would lose it know I mean that much to them to have a photo of us framed in his house. This is a beautiful story. She's a great friend. I'd hang theirs to if I had a photo of them, not to even out the score of hung photos but because she did it. Why not you too? You know?"
