The amount of strength and courage it takes to face another day is beyond what most people understand. It's not that most don't see it but only a few who aren't jealous of triumph. Super proud,  I'm proud of you, we're all proud of you and you should know it."

Your worth far more than what you think of and why they slide right off you to the bottom with all the other pieces of shits that have tried to stick on you and now make a giant piece of shit that'll try to stick again someday but you know pieces of shit no matter how big can just hose of with a bit of water hence why we cry but feel better because we've washed the pieces of shits away. And not even flex tape can stick to shit and stop shit from happening. Hope it made you feel better and at least brought a smile or even smirk smile."
