I grew up in the 1980s and 90s.  Every evening my father (born in the mid 1930s) watched the news (first local then ABC news with Peter Jennings). I would often watch with him. He didn‚Äôt shield me from devastating or disturbing news stories.  He instead parented me through them by engaging me, from a very young age, in conversation to discuss what I had just seen.

I think sadly in Canada we tend to be apathetic when it comes to politics. I also have to recognize my own inherent biases being a voter in ‚Äúbig bad‚Äù Toronto who for the most part is properly represented in federal elections due to the size of the city.

worldnews,ferll8w,t1_ferk2pa,1579355492.0,This is why I like our parliamentary system.  In the last federal election Canadians used our votes to send a message and we ended up with a minority government.  I feel that is our way of saying to politicians you all pissed us off and now we are going to force you to work together to get shit done.  The alternative to the MPs working together is a vote of no confidence and another general election which will piss off most Canadians to no end.  It is in the politicians‚Äô best interests to come to agreements on things during a minority government despite the bravado immediately following the election by certain parties indicating they were prepared to vote down the government and send us back to the polls.  In truth no party can afford another election right now and Scheer paid for his actions  with the leadership of his party.  As an aside I felt Singh actually performed the best during the election campaign but I was very disappointed in his comments after the election saying he was prepared to send Canadians back to the polls with a no confidence vote.  The NDP are broke and he really hurt his credibility by saying such nonsense I felt.

politics,fea6w88,t1_fe89lut,1578945048.0,There is no such thing as abortion after birth. I suggest you educate yourself on the human gestational period and how weeks pregnant is determined before you form your opinion.  Weeks gestation is based on last menstrual period.  Ovulation occurs around mid cycle which varies for all women. Conception occurs 2-4 days after ovulation.  Implantation occurs after that.  A woman may not  know she‚Äôs pregnant at 2-3 weeks pregnant.  So arbitrary limitations on weeks gestation have no scientific basis

So should he have to wear a chastity belt in public just in case I can‚Äôt control myself?  What you are describing, if occurring in public, is a lewd act which most places have laws against.  Men have to wear clothes in public but some still get arrested for mastrubating on the subway.
