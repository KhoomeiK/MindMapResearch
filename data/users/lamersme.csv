antiMLM,fe63br9,t3_ensse5,1578880842.0,"I had a distant FB friend who got into that toothpaste MLM...the saddest thing was that whenever she posted about it, there were a million comments, but they were literally ALL huns from the same MLM commenting bullshit like “our whole family loves this toothpaste!” and “I haven’t had a cavity the whole time I’ve used this stuff!” It didn’t seem like anybody else besides them were actually interested in it, made me feel really sad for her.
