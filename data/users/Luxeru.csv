Anxiety,fdt27x7,t1_fdszpsm,1578710963.0,"I wasn't with him at the appointment, he's 19.  And he's a typical teenager, giving me vague answers.  I reread his text to me and I guess his Dr. just suggested them, not a script.  I'm going to try to get more info out of him.  Mostly I just want to know what kind to buy.  I really don't know much about it.  Recreational/medical marajuana is legal here in Michigan, cbd laws are kind of confusing.  I guess he should get a medical card."

UnresolvedMysteries,fdajxh0,t3_dya9s4,1578246892.0,Atlanta child murders in the 1980's.  We know who did it.  And he was convicted of the murder if 2 adults but no charges were brought against him for the 28 murdered children.  The murders stopped once he was discovered/ arrested.

UnresolvedMysteries,fc7kohg,t1_fc7g0kt,1577510525.0,Good idea...I can see that.  That was a devastating hurricane.
UnresolvedMysteries,fc7e84m,t3_egjrug,1577504809.0,"Both times she was ultimately found in water.  It would make sense she went towards water again, plus her clothes being off.  She was probably pretty vulnerable, naked on a beach in a fugue state.  I think someone may have taken advantage of her state of mind and nudity.  Not sure if the beach had any boats, canoes nearby that someone could have kidnapped her in.  Or maybe she was taken in a car.

The water really makes me want to say it was a drowning, but no body seems to suggest otherwise.  I wonder how often drowned bodies do disappear.  It has to sometimes happen.  Maybe something from the deep drug her away."

TrueCrimeDiscussion,fbww54d,t3_ees5sb,1577161047.0,Guilty as sin.  Massive amounts of circumstantial evidence.  Everything points to the SOB and then some.  If you don't think he's guilty then you must not have paid attention.
