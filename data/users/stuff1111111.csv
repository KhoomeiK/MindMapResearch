practice is sometimes so uninspiring and unmotivating but daily progressive steps, diligent practice, working towards something is what is needed to work the body and the mind towards change"
getdisciplined,ffj2c11,t1_ffiwtmr,1579988626.0,"the coping mechanism is a good strategy to help your mind, for me my simplistic coping mechanism is writing down all my thoughts, but i force myself to be balanced and honest, so i must absolutely write something bad and good, about my current life/situation

some other mechanisms i employ to help me with motivation require a bit of work and fair amount of visualization abilities

1. i use a memory /event in my past of which i have a 'good' feeling of. I need to have already made the imprint of that event strong and clear in my head when it occured. Usually this is a memory of me finishing a specific work and the feeling/satisfaction/relief i had after it.   
i extend this to other feelings, 'bad' feelings of 'devastation', 'anger' etc. I need to be able to visualize the exact circumstances so that i can relive those feelings 'good' or 'bad', usually failing at something or unable to finish work, or just stress
2. when im at the precipice/crossroads of not doing anything OR doing something i try to imagine the variegated ways my day can progress from that point and i bring up those feelings in the past; ok so this is the 'good' feeling if i do this right now and that later and that later, and this is the 'bad' feeling if i do that and that and that etc etc this takes a fair amount of reflection, introspection, recall and practice!
3. the additional thing that sometimes happen is i communicate with myself at some marker points in my past/future, its more of a 'hey woah didnt expect to see you, how is it over there? lol' instead of a real conversation. i see myself 10+ years ago unable to fall asleep staring at the ceiling because im depressed and he's not able to figure out why he cant sleep, sometimes its 2-way, most times its just 1-way. Practically this allows you to distance yourself from your immediate feelings.

not much else i can advice aside from general BUT still very effective mechanisms (yet unfortunately very ineffective advice because everyone gives it and advice is easier given than received)

1. cardio exercise daily at the exact same time!
2. meditate at the same spot at the same time daily!
3. apnea breathing exercises! (look it up!)

KindVoice,ffiv6yg,t3_eturtk,1579983512.0,"i definitely have felt unmotivated and unfulfilled in life and in work. i myself am a bit choosy with jobs right now sort of being spoiled because of the market /domain im in, i want to make sure that i have the right motivation for myself and for my future employer that not only am i doing this for money im doing it for myself and hopefully for society or the future.

but i preempt all that with thoughts about:

ok, so if you just become a musician/artist/famous person instead of becoming a wage earner and you become world famous and have ALL the money and ALL the sex and ALL the X,Y,Z,A,B,Cs then what? what happens next? What is fulfillment after that? ... and what is fulfillment at the moment of death 10,20,50, 60 years later is it being able to brag to everyone? or the reminiscence of that feeling that you once had?

i apply that thought to everything that i think i want just to figure out what the real motivation is, so what is the final goal of buying X? what is the final goal of doing Z? etc etc

it does beg the question about WHY do we do the things we do, here specifically Working a Job. Obviously first answer is Money to most. But if you didnt need money or you didnt need praise or attention what would you REALLY do? Maybe the answer for most people is just amble aimlessly and dont focus on anything, and some work on things they love, but what is it that you love? (and what is love really?! lol) 

few trite thoughts ive summed up in my short varied life

1. knowing what you like/love are good at in life IS hard. Not everyone knows what theyre good at and what they like or can love doing. And actually getting paid money to do what you THINK you like/love is even harder
2. being/feeling fulfilled and being/feeling content takes a while and does require work on its own. Work is Self reflection, to take time in a quiet space to explore your feelings your motivations towards and against things. Many would opt for a therapist instead. Acknowledging and researching your bodily/hormonal cycles, the workings of oxytocin, endorphin, serotonin, cortisol to make you feel 'good' or 'bad' is also key here.
3. what i do naively understand about oxytocin is that its the care hormone, its somewhat triggered by connections you make to others (through sex or otherwise), if i visualize and work towards my connection to the world/society at large and focus my efforts towards that it personally does give me a feeling invisible fulfillment that i have done my part to help society the future, the bigger picture. look up Affective Neuroscience, Panksepp. 
4. doing what youre good at, while solving problems is addictive and its what makes you feel good (serotonin!) look up Self Determination Theory
5. what ive realized for myself in regards to the things i specifically do is ""There is no Greatest Art/Novel/Music/Engineering/Idea/Philosophy/Belief and no one is waiting for it or me, the only reason we do things we do is to keep ourselves alive"". So is everything in life just distraction after distraction of continuously diminishing returns until we die? Only if you let it be. That empty realization isnt all bad, the life you lead is only as valuable as you make it and appreciate it
6. Exercise and meditation will help your body. Your body can then help your mind.

sorry much rambling no practical use :)

so why did i write this? because of what i wrote above: ive experienced it AND i want to connect with others/the bigger picture (inevitably i dont need to know their names, ages, genders races etc)

what is the final goal? no final goal, only immediate goal to trigger oxytocin :D"

LetsTalkMusic,ffhj17x,t3_etn9cc,1579937469.0,"im on the side of cultural relativism and scientific skepticism/pyrrhonnism, so unfortunately AND fortunately i agree AND disagree

to say 'all sound IS music' is analogous to 'all words ARE/IS philosophy' or 'all words ARE/IS wisdom', 'all statements ARE/IS philosophy', 'all conversations ARE/IS philosophy', 'all data IS information', 'all beliefs ARE/IS religion', 'all infants ARE adults' ad infinitum

law of the exclusive middle (no i wont go into non-classical logic even though my first statement does!)

i think separation and differentiation is what allows humans, symbol makers to create symbols, which is why there are things like 'music' and 'sound', and one might be able to trace a curve between the state of 'sound' to the state of 'music', that transition curve from 'X' to 'Y' isnt always afforded by every one/organism, one needs to have the capacity/capability for it, eg ears able to hear within a certain range, sense able to sense a specific modality

this is something youve already expressed, someone A views LedZep sans Bonham as 'music' and someone B not as 'music' but does this actually qualify both the instances of LedZep with without Bonham as 'music' for every one/organism (in known universe)? I think i have to defer you to linguistics and the creation/definition of symbols and words and language, maybe it IS true 'all tables ARE chairs' (because both can be sat on) , in the end i do agree that it is personal and (culturally) relativist but it would be a hard day when you go furniture shopping with your gf who doesnt share your definition of the word 'table'

I dont understand how youre conflating 'Music' with (Western) 'Music Theory' though AND i dont know how youre conflating 'Music Theory' with 'Western Music Theory'. Look up Carnatic music, the Indian continent has a very long musical tradition and history and a lot of theory. Also Maqam music theory, my naive/ignorant view is Arabia and Persia probably inherited Indian music but yeah im ignorant there...

' It is quite simply the most natural progression of music ' There has been a lot of music before Equal Temperament-Common Period Western Music Theory came about

Also modern music making and the resulting 'music' in such instances never needs theory, ive met many an ignoramus sightreading blind virtuouso drummer/guitarist/instrumentalist/vocalist making good/bad sounds/music/chirps/woops

edit:

ha! i agree 'all sounds CAN BE music', it doesnt say much though, its saying 'all americans CAN BE the american president', both are givens"
pornfree,ffhg3mh,t3_etc12w,1579933764.0,"im glad that youre turning your life around, its unfortunate that sometimes 'professionals' have to wear some roles like 'bad cop' to enforce state law ...

imo, i think what is debilitating/disadvantageous about porn is not so much that its about sex, its just that \*you get porn so easy\*, its the instant gratification, and with everything that feels good and comes easy, you keep repeating it and repeating it to the detriment of everything else, to some degree people label this as 'addiction' (right? im not a medical professional and im not using 'addiction' in a technical md manner)

right now i think im treating free books on libgen like porn because i keep downloading them and wasting my time and not doing anything else (like actually reading them!) its the same debilitating mentality! 

but obviously there are many things which are instantly gratifying, easy and should be easy but is advantageous to us/autonomous biological organisms eg walking, breathing, sleeping, eating ... so it should be ok to keep doing them a lot without care for anything else right? so those things cant be 'addiction'-prone ? right?

though repeatedly eating and eating and eating without doing anything else does sound like an addiction/is disadvantageous... is continuously sleeping an 'addiction'/disadvantageous? .... hmm continuously breathing cant be disadvantageous? if i didnt continuously breathe id die, though if one has heard of apnea breathing or WimHof then you might agree breathing too much might be 'disadvantageous' to your body cells (really?) ... something to ponder about ...

which leads me to sex, i think youll come to a point with your gf where youll be having sex as much as you want whenever you want maybe to the detriment of satisfaction or any other life activity, only because the sex is so instantly gratifying and accessible and within reach

I think if everyone treated masturbation, watching vanilla porn, having sex, loving each other, eating, breathing, sleeping, walking, running not just reactively but actively and measuredly and with some degree of mindfulness and celebration like a valuable hard earned reward that can only be reaped every once in a blue moon then every moment of life will always be valuable and worth living

unfortunately our biological worth does run out just like every piece of material matter out there in the universe so you have to sip from the cup just enough to make sure it lasts

TLDR: Dont give in to instant gratification, treat sex (with your gf), everything else in life and even porn like a scarce valuable resource so that you can continue valuing all these facets of life for a long(er) time

good luck with your parole!"

like everyone has said and asked you need to be able to differentiate types of scales, major, minor, 7ths, and from there with enough exposure, youll be able to 'feel'  what you want. I dont think i can hear complete harmonies but i can imagine the feeling that i want so usually its some note that sticks out, whether its the 3rd or 7th 9th etc which dictates a segment's overall harmony. The melody i hear/imagine in the end has a attached harmonic feeling to it when i imagine the melody but for the most part i dont think i 'hear' it in my head.

i would recommend what worked for me 

1. breaking down and experimenting with every permutation of interval starting from dyad, triad, quad, ... chord shapes and then their inversions in all keys eg chord shapes (in C) C-D, C-E, C-F, C-G .... C-E-G, C-Eb-G, C-G-B, C-G-Bb, C-G-D ... C-G-D-E, C-G-D-Eb ad infinitum. For me breaking down and turning inside out gives me sort of an intuition for what sounds are possible
2. try and substitute your voice to fill in the permutations of chords. eg (in C) play C-sing D, play C-sing E ... play C-G-sing E, play C-G-sing Eb, play C-E-sing G ... ad infinitum
3. experiment with permutation of progressions and cadences, dont just stick to V-I, IV-I. How many cadences can you get with just two chords? like chord shapes and inversions, iteratively figure it out,   
I-I, II-I, III-I, IV-I, V-I ..... I-III, II-III ... I-V, II-V, III-V, IV-V, V-V ... ad infinitum
4. sing over the progression, cadence permutations starting with I, ii, II, iii, III, ad infinitum
5. use an ear training program to test your listening for chord types and inversions
6. In the end use your explorations in your song writing!"
loneliness,ff9kts8,t3_eqjlpm,1579715116.0,"for any animal the threshold to love is quite low and the threshold to not love is probably even lower than to love, all feelings come and go, but 'love' like all emotions, fear, anger, hunger are functional and do serve a purpose aside from the feelings themselves if you only focus on the feelings which will always come and go then what you will get will be the constant comings and goings pushing and pulling wanting and not wanting ...

it would be an interesting experiment to see which animals in the animal kingdom can 'fall in love' when only meeting each other by lets say the sound of their chirps/caws/hoots/roars over the internet"
Biohackers,ff9i5du,t3_ers62y,1579713524.0,"hmm i think social anxiety only applies to me when a space/event is without purpose eg freeform party, im only two ways about it, i have to declaratively tell myself what i should do eg 'look like im having fun' 'dance around like im drunk' or just not care (which is default), in default mode i might feel some anxiety, because i have nothing to focus on or i will just do something to focus my attention eg sketching, reading a book. If im not doing anything physical i will just meditate or stare into space if i cant focus then i will think 'why am i here again? ok im here specifically for X, but im obliged to stay longer after X so i have bear the burden of my choice'

speaking for myself, a non verified aspergers, i have no problem speaking to people out of the blue if i cognitively set out to do it. I definitely have been to 'parties' where i 'enjoyed' it because i declared to myself the purpose (unfortunately most of the time it becomes quite OTT). For the most part, i find initiating conversation futile, because most would usually want to discuss things like 'where do you live, what do you do, what do you think of so-and-so movies/celebrity/politician ...' ad infinitum

in regards to empathy, i dont think i lack the ability to feel others out (i guess its mostly cognitive), at times i can sort of guess people want to open up or want me to open up to them, men or women similarly, but for the most part i understand and i tell myself its futile to need to connect with more people when you already know what your functions/goals are. I do not find it a problem that inevitably i do not. For the most part im not spurred by feelings or rather i rationalize them (away) a lot, fear, anger, desire etc

i try to find a middle ground or synthesis point for the wide interests, but TODO lists and being regulated/disciplined in pursuing those interests helps a lot of course.

to touch back on anxiety, cardio exercises, apnea breathing exercises, meditation helped me a lot. Anxiety is very body based and no amount of logical thinking/rationalizing can easily control an untrained nervous system/body.

to no end, of the sporadic social connections that i have made, have i ever managed to shed 'weird guy' label, its not a problem though.

good luck! :)"

I know what synaesthesia is defined as but i dont even think my description of my sensory experience counts as synaesthesia, which to me is Input(X) -> System -> Output(Y) instead of Input(X) -> System -> Output(X)

Also from a very facile understanding of both your and my experiences i dont think it describes synaesthesia either, which it seems to be for both of us: System -> Output(X)"

Its pretty benign/lame actually, if it happens well shapes form around what i see in front of me/what i see in front of me get demarcated into shapes-frames and they sort of pulsate/move/push-pull/translate shear horizontally vertically, they sort of have some rhythm i guess, ive never taken lsd but i hear from lsd peeps 'visual transformation' is the norm so i thought meditation isnt so far from getting to that transcendental state (or the other way round)"

getdisciplined,fco9ci6,t1_fcnqqed,1577826710.0,"anxiety is unfortunately also very corporeal, its how reactive your nervous system is. So knowing how to turn your nervous system on or off or rather doing exercises to train it to not be so reactive is potentially one solution. Aside from approaching fears logically and reasoning to myself (which works) i have found that these solutions which address the body (the nervous system et al) really really help  
1. apnea breathing exercises, similar to wim hof method (or rather wim hof incorporates it)  
2. cardio exercises  
3. meditation   
4. EMDR  
5. 'exposure therapy'

I have found that 'bookmarking' feelings, bad or good is a useful practice, so that i can bring them up anytime to remind myself how it feels so that in effect i can turn it off or control it when the actual triggers happen. Requires a bit of practice and constant effort!"
