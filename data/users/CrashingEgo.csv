Damn. That type of attention can be toxic, especially with lewd pics. People are driven by their libidos, but that's no excuse for you to be ignored unless you post pics. You're more than just a fap image. Do you have any contact with people other than posting pics? Something that has meaning to you?"

One is that if you do so, you don't see how your life will end up. I'm not sure where my life will lead, or how much I'll experience before I get to that moment. 
Two, I can't imagine how the people I leave behind will feel. I don't know your circumstances, but I want to know more. It's messy when you leave people behind, and if you don't have anyone, I want you to know that I care about you.  I have tears in my eyes. You mean something to a random person on reddit.

You have the Black Templar, Mentors, Executioners, Lamentors, Raptors, or my favorites: Carcharodons Astra, ghost white silent Astartes who get in close and use overwhelming force while being utterly silent, or the Exorcists, a Chapter that has their Aspirants demonically possessed and then exorcised, with glyphs and wards tattooed onto their bones.
