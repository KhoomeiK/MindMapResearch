Is part of the definition of Veganism. Is it practical for you to re-train? Probably not. If that is how you make a living, then that's what you've got to do. If you work as a cook, 95%+ of people you cook for will want animal products in their food. We do not live in a vegan world, and still have bills to pay, people to support and lives to enjoy.

My only advice would be that you can make a lot of difference by advocating for more vegan options, or 'meatless' days (no matter how that sort of pandering to omnis irritates me to my absolute core). If you are able to get others to become plant-based (even if it's not every meal) you can multiply the good that you would be doing alone.

As in, I KNOW it's wrong to eat animal products, but I have to retrain myself to not see animal products as food.

One thing that really helped me with this process was watching documentaries (like Earthilings, Dominion, etc). It helps to actually think 'that's not a steak, it's a piece of cow'. 

We have such a disconnect between where food is produced and how it ends up on our plate. Whilst many see a chicken breast cellophane-wrapped on a supermarket's shelf simply as 'food', they do not connect the dots, and that is in fact a dead chicken (no matter how stupid that sounds).

To actually be vegan is very simple - don't consume animal products. However, to think in a 'vegan mindset' requires a bit of work. Educate yourself, exercise some willpower. Nobody is expecting you to be 'perfect', but don't use that as an excuse to 'slip up' and mitigate responsibility for your actions.

In fact, the younger the tuna, the lower the levels of mercury in it's meat. This is because mercury levels build up over the lifetime of the fish.

Tuna can live for over 30 years and, assuming that fish was fairly old, would have had quite high levels of mercury in it.

So, price is not *necessarily* an indicator of mercury levels, just quality/flavour.

To look at our physiology as evidence for needing meat is so profoundly ridiculous. 

Whether you eat meat or not at this point is an ethical consideration, not a physiological one. 

Humans do not *need* meat to survive, that is fact. The point you should be arguing is if humans *should* eat meat."

Do you think you could tear another animal's throat out with our shitty human teeth?

Humans are omnivores, not obligate carnivores. We don't need meat to survive. We're not cavemen any more, we can make a conscious ethical decision about what (and who) we eat.

This appeal to physiology is so weak it makes me want to take a b12 supplement."
