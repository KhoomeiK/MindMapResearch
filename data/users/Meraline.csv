Y'all act like they were all absolutely REEEEing the entire time but they knew the game would still sell like hotcakes, even some users said they were still getting the game anyway and no brigading or getting mad at them was encouraged. I was even going to get Shield at first until I saw how drastic the cuts were and if they're going to add more pokemon in updates, I might as well wait."
