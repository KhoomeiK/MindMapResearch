Go in holiday, and have his staff pretend he didn't, then deny he was in Hawaii, while he was taking photos with tourists in Hawaii. 

Come home as soon as possible (he stayed two more days). 

Speak on radio about how he (federal leader) is not in an active role in managing the fires across more than 50% of states. 

Deny that a national state of emergency exists.

Denied federal funds and resources to fire-fighters or affected persons.

Explain that now is not the time to be looking at the cause of the fires. Even if concerned emergency management experts have been seeking his audience for 8 months. 

Holding a garden party for the Australian & NZ cricket teams. 

Drive a BMW into fire affected towns and try to force photo opportunities with people he's ignored and abandoned for 1-3 months.
