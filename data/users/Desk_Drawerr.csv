aww,ffev2n0,t1_ffeutfa,1579866803.0,"Well, 1) Idk why anyone would put a cgi snake on r/aww considering they're already cute as is, and it'd probably be against some kind of rule,

2) hognoses are a real species,

3) the footage is just sped up.

That enough proof?"
aww,ffcb53m,t1_ffbzk9j,1579795634.0,"Well, it's not. It's a real snake."
aww,ffbses6,t1_ffbrwn0,1579780972.0,"If the snake was biting and wouldn't let go, it was probably some kind of confused feeding response. Snakes will be snakes, I wouldn't consider it ""nearly dying"", though, if proper precautions were taken."
aww,ffausl1,t1_ff8qrfk,1579744980.0,"Haha, funny joke."
aww,ffardct,t1_ffar93u,1579742707.0,Oh it's only venomous enough to give you a bit of a painful lump and thats about it. They're rear fanged so they'd have to chew a fair bit to get any venom in you.
aww,ff9st67,t1_ff9sbdt,1579720479.0,"Was the boa exhibiting a feeding response, or was it just squeezing? How many people were present at that time?

Things like this are easily prevented."
aww,ff9nsbi,t1_ff9nlq9,1579716863.0,Exactly. I haven't ever encountered a snake that absolutely requires uv light.
aww,ff9l7of,t1_ff9l58q,1579715343.0,The footage is just sped up my dude.
aww,ff9hr9a,t1_ff8t4fg,1579713283.0,"Nah, snakes do move like that. And hognoses are a very real species."
aww,ff9hlxj,t1_ff945o7,1579713192.0,"Bro literally everything you said is bs. Most of those things you've said I do not provide for my snake, nor did the pet shop I got him from. He is three years old, happy, and healthy. 

UV light is not required, especially for nocturnal species. Live feeding is unnecessary and dangerous, and it's also illegal in my country.

Snakes are very low maintenance animals, they're calm and quiet. They have heat and humidity requirements dependent on their species, but that's about it. Feed them according to their size, in intervals best for their age, and you're good.

With your ""expertise"", however, I'd say you're unfit to own a snake."
aww,ff9gk8f,t1_ff92sfb,1579712552.0,Not really. How's it look fake?
aww,ff9gil6,t1_ff8zifh,1579712524.0,Bruh he's a baby colubrid.
aww,ff9gbuo,t1_ff93497,1579712410.0,Hognoses aren't constrictors. They're venomous.
aww,ff9ei6t,t1_ff8xltl,1579711283.0,By moving around in circles?
aww,ff9edo0,t1_ff8vfsa,1579711202.0,"It's a hognose. I have a royal python that happily chills around my neck. He's extremely docile, like most snakes.

A boa would be about the same, since common boas can't grow large enough to eat anything more than an adult rabbit, they'd have no reason to harm you, unless they mistook your arm for a dead rabbit."
Sneks,ff692tq,t1_ff4xx7q,1579622004.0,"Yeah, one of my cats likes to attack feet for no reason. All animals are different, haha."
Sneks,ff4x3z2,t1_ff4wpgs,1579574541.0,"Yeah, my cats have a habit of wanting to get IN the vivarium all the time. It's kinda cute, but I don't want them scratching him. As much as I'd love for them to get along, im pretty sure cats have evolved to eat snakes, so they're staying well away from Oscar."
Sneks,ff4w96y,t1_ff4w11m,1579573955.0,"I'd hide too if a giant cat was watching me. One of my cats kinda wants to eat my snake, lmao. Hope all goes well for you."

FondantHate,fekkobo,t1_fekc4dv,1579202044.0,"It really is like that, too. I sculpt with polymer clay, and it's literally just inedible fondant. Not that fondant is at all edible to begin with."
