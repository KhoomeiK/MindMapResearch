Second, I personally know two people who committed voter fraud. In both cases, I even filled out online police reports - but I wasn't even contacted, and to the best of my knowledge they weren't either.

In the first case, someone's grandmother was registered for the absentee ballot - and then died out of state. The voting records were never updated, and her absentee ballot showed up in the mail a full year after she died. This person filled out, and sent in, the absentee ballot. They publicly supported a candidate that didn't win.

In the second case, someone moved between two counties in the same state. When they registered to vote in the first county, they registered as ""John Thomas Smith"". When they moved and registered in the second county, normally this would automatically cancel their registration in the first county. But they registered as ""John T Smith"" in the new county, and it never removed them from the old county. They still received voter registration information at the old address (their parent's house). So, on election day, they voted in person, twice, showing valid ID. They publicly supported a candidate that didn't win.

I don't think there's systematic voter fraud going on (IE one person or group tampering with thousands or millions of votes), but it's *definitely* going on at an individual level, at least in some states."

news,felspcu,t1_felp4qj,1579229983.0,"So, I have no idea if this applies to JSTOR or Wikipedia. However, their finances should be reasonably public. But a general problem in America is that ""nonprofit"" has a very nuanced meaning.

A ""for profit"" company is owned by humans who receive some form of equity / dividends from the company when it earns a profit. A ""non profit"" company can *still make profit*, it just can't pay it out to ""owners"". In fact, these retained earnings are often necessary for legitimate charities: someone like the red cross must have millions of dollars just sitting around so they can pay for services during a disaster. 

This has a TON of loopholes, though. First and most common is paying key employees huge salaries. They don't get stock options like the executives of a public company, but they're still getting a million dollars a year.

The second type is more subtle. Instead of a hospital owning the building it's based out of, it will rent the building from a for-profit real estate company that just happens to have the perfect hospital building ready to go. The ""non profit"" writes rent off as a business expense, while the ""for profit"" turns a nice profit for it's shareholders as capital gains.

I think journals have numerous legitimate costs associated with publishing and peer review, and have gilded several responses in this thread discussing those details. However, being a non-profit doesn't automatically excuse high revenue."
