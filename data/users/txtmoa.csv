The original commenter stated “men are working longer harder hours when will women put their weight in” which is 1) extremely vague and 2) has NOTHING to do with the main article nor does that justify men not helping around the household. Sure, my point regarding the wage gap may have been incorrect the way you looked at it, but that wasn’t the point of the argument. Just because statistically ON AVERAGE men are projected to work longer hours does not mean that they don’t have an obligation to help with household chores or that their hours worked are “harder” than a women’s. Do men truly think they get a pass on housework because the bureau of labor statistics states that they work .6 hours longer on average? Using national statistics doesn’t justify shit when you look at individual family households. Also, I only referenced the term “harder” because I was referring to the stan dudes comment, not yours. Why would I feel embarrassed because you presented me with articles I could’ve researched myself lmao you’re not Einstein dude. I could’ve easily found articles justifying my position on the wage gap but I honestly didn’t come here to argue about an irrelevant topic.

Lady Gaga isn’t the only pop artist in the US, and she’s released tracks recently (I mean she was just in an Oscar winning movie that won best original song). If we’re referring to this decade alone, One Direction, Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars and countless of other artists have continuously put out billboard charting hits. Pop music is very much still extremely colorful and prevalent in the US and the world. And arguably, I believe it’s still pretty good. The only reason it’s declined a little is because rap music and followings have risen tremendously (ex. Drake or Travis Scott). If you listen to the radio, pop music might seem bland, but many artists have put out very beautiful music. Call me basic, but I think Billie Eilish’s music is beautiful and Ariana Grande’s newest album is amazing. Taylor Swift’s Reputation album was also very cool and different. There’s many lowkey western artists who have FANTASTIC music. I have never really understood the western pop hate train in the Kpop fandom when many Kpop tracks are the exact same genre as American ones. I’ve been a Kpop fan since 2008 and the hate for western pop has only recently been prevalent in the past 5 or so years. I don’t understand it at all tbh

It’s very hard to penetrate the mainstream market for Americans since the population listens to what they’re used to and sticks with it. I can’t imagine them being open to korean music since it’s not in English. The only reason Spanish music does well is because Americans are much more familiar with Spanish and it’s the second most common language in the US, but even then, Latin artists tend to release music in English once they gain popularity in the US. This is also why most anime never penetrated into the western market but anime that was translated and dubbed in English (such as Pokémon, Naruto or Dragon Ball Z) and played on American channels became very popular and well known."

The American healthcare system will eventually change and people in the future will think you’re one of the crazy people. I would rather earn 80k than 100k if it meant that other people could afford their healthcare (and yes, doctors in other nations still make a lot of money). If you really think 80% of earnings are taken, you’re highly uneducated in that department. Do you honestly think that doctors in Canada or the UK are living in poverty because their healthcare is cheaper. Doctors in those countries are still wealthy and thriving. A general practice doctor can make an average 130k in the UK, which is a lot since they don’t have medical bills or student loans to worry about. There are medical professions from canada that state that their income is relatively the same in both nations when you factor in taxation and insurance. I’ve studied societies that have cheaper healthcare and their taxes are not even much higher than ours. “Capitalism saved my life” get out of here with that bullshit lmao. Your life would’ve been saved in any other first world country. People in the UK, Canada, Japan, etc. actually have longer life expectancies and lower infant mortality rates than the US. Hmmm I wonder why :O Capitalism kills more lives than it saves. There are hundreds of stories of people who don’t have insurance and can’t afford urgent medical care (even insulin in some cases) who will chose death over having their family be in debt for the rest of their lives. Imagine believing that healthcare isn’t a genuine right as a human being. The United States is supposed to be the best in the world but won’t even help it’s own people. 

Also, the US has about a 33% tax wedge whereas places like the UK have around 40%. It’s honestly not much higher. If you think Americans don’t already get taxed majority of their income, then wake up. My dad made 800k last year and took home about 500k. And guess what? He didn’t get cheaper healthcare, education, or infrastructure out of it like any other country lmao. Half of our budget goes to a military that we don’t even use. But he still leads a great life. I’m sure the billionaires that barely get taxed a cent would be fine if they also had 30% taken. I don’t personally agree with Bernie Sanders. I don’t think that healthcare should be free, but in no way should insulin be 20x the price that it was 20 years ago.

Iamactuallyverybadass,fclygr6,t1_fckxegv,1577759563.0,I live in DFW and there’s not that much littering here :)
AskReddit,fclxlyr,t1_fcluioj,1577758954.0,"You do realize a large number of Americans work in careers that don’t provide proper insurance? Insurance isn’t guaranteed. And most insurance doesn’t cover specific illnesses, such as diabetes, birth defects, and rare diseases. Cancer treatment or specific surgeries may not be covered in certain plans. Ambulance rides are often not covered and can be thousands of dollars. Rehabilitation also gets cut in insurance costs early on in many cases. I’ve talked to many stroke patients who had their therapy and rehab cut early on because of their insurance companies. Some people can’t afford deductibles that can go up to 6-7k in some instances, also. I had a 6k bill in deductibles because I went to the ER with stomach pain. Stomach pain. Many things are also not covered in insurance - for example, augmentative communication devices for non-verbal children are not covered. These devices can be thousands of dollars. The only reason medicine is expensive in the US is because of capitalistic greed and conservatives who can’t admit that they’re wrong. The US is the only first world nation with expensive healthcare, and has one of the worst healthcare systems in the first world. I’m never going to suggest that healthcare be free, but there is absolutely no reason for it to be as expensive as it is. Try again. (Sincerely, a medical school student).

Also, don’t get me started on college education lmao"
AskReddit,fcluc06,t1_fcltx08,1577756661.0,Definitely healthier than paying 100k in hospital bills
AskReddit,fclu0by,t3_ehn3ua,1577756432.0,Juice! It’s very sugary and bad for you
kpop,fcl26st,t3_ehnld5,1577738192.0,"1. Treasure 13 debut - the boys deserve it. They’ve been in dungeon for an entire year + some of them have been training on top of that for years now

2. X1/IZ*One comeback - resume activities and have successful comebacks with minimum hate. I fear the netizen backlash and I hope that it’s not strong. These poor children have been through a lot because of mnet

3. More TXT and Stray Kids interactions (they’re my fave groups and a lot of the members are friends!!)

4. Blackpink comeback(s) (obviously)

5. Better airport security - I’ve been seeing a lot of dangerous mobbing going on in airport videos. It makes me scared for the members and even the fans (a lot of the fans are very small and can get crushed)

6. More variety shows that feature several groups interaction with each other - sorry I just live for group interactions bc I’m an old Kpop fan :( 

7. WAYV x NCT U/Dream/127 interactions, WinWin joining 127 for a comeback, Dream permanent unit

8. Return of cute/school concepts for the younger groups.. I’m here for it :)

9. TXT comeback - Black haired Beomgyu, blonde Soobin, Kai growing taller than his hyungs, yeonjun rap covers, more taehyun vocal covers"
kpop,fcl1ez2,t1_fckwxup,1577737719.0,Sana probably thrived off the Gangnam style performance LOL
AvPD,fckbap7,t1_fckb3y2,1577721435.0,I’m sure it is. My daydreams are about me being a whole other person (or I guess a super idealized version of myself). They mostly involve either me getting a massive amount of love and attention (being very beautiful and famous) or having great intimate relationships
MurderedByWords,fcj74nx,t1_fcj6cr6,1577678928.0,"I agree that romantic and physical attraction go hand and hand. That’s what I was trying to say. You rarely are purely romantically attracted to someone, unless you’re asexual. It’s also bad if you’re purely sexually attracted to someone, because that’s not “love”. My comment was stating that I don’t understand the romantic attraction of men towards women, as I am a straight female"
AvPD,fcj3tp0,t3_ehfygi,1577676584.0,"I agree. It gave me a huge sense of relief. I always read about social anxiety but it never resonated with me. People always said how they’re scared of crowds, looking dumb in public, or being at parties, but I’m not scared of those things. I’m scared of actual interpersonal interaction with people I already know. That kind of fear was never mentioned in social anxiety, so I thought I was just broken. No mental illness I read about online related to me. The day I found out about AVPD was life changing. I thought I was dreaming because I finally found a diagnosis that was directly relating to my life. It was like they modeled the disorder after me (sadly lol). It was the same feeling I got when I read about maladaptive daydreaming (which is more common, I assume). I’m glad that there’s a discussion board for people who are similar to me. It makes me feel a lot less scared about this condition."
MurderedByWords,fcj11dw,t1_fcirx8u,1577674615.0,"Okay, maybe it’s different between females and males. Males are taught their entire life to be strong and protect, even if you are gay or short or whatever. But for girls it’s different. Many of us have an instinct to want to be protected. And it’s not the protection of a parent. It’s rather a feeling of emotional security. Being in a guys arms or in the company of a male makes you feel safe and secure, like when you’re having a bad day or are anxious. It’s much different in the way that a parent would make you feel. It’s a feeling that you can’t really get from a friend either. It’s like if the whole world is against you, you still feel safe in his arms. It’s not like the protection of a car or gun. It’s an emotional protection. Maybe it seems immature, but it’s a genuine feeling and need for a lot of girls. I know many girls and we’ve talked about this feeling and need before. It might be more instinctual than anything, but it’s a reason why we tend to fall in love, along with endearment and sexual attraction. Look at princess movies, how Prince Charming comes and rescues the princess. Or why firefighters or other hero-like people are attractive to girls. This isn’t just a fictional story but an actual reason for of attraction for many girls. I even see this kind of need for security in lesbian relationships.  (Of course, not every single girl may experience this)"
kpop,fcip0wj,t1_fcgrcac,1577666444.0,I hope magnum and treasure don’t really get enforced initially. I see them being stronger as a full unit first and then when they have name recognition to start having a little bit of separation.
kpop,fciorjs,t1_fcg07o0,1577666294.0,Yeah.. they were supposed to have a whole variety show a few months after the finale but the scandal happened right after their last episode
kpop,fcionav,t3_eh6mr6,1577666221.0,They’re such a talented group + have great visuals. I hope they succeed because it would exciting to see them progress and grow
kpop,fciobgm,t3_ehd0lm,1577666024.0,"This might be a sad take, but for me personally, KPOP is a form of escapism. I’m a lonely person and watching these groups of people who are the same age as me interact and do fun things.. it feels like they are my friends. I get to know their lives and interests and I can see them accomplish things that I’ll never get to do. I almost live my life through them, which is sad but true. Sometimes my only will to keep going through life is that if I don’t live, I won’t get to see my favorite groups do more great things. 

On the music side, I think they are extremely talented individuals with great mv production and choreo. I love the pop/EDM sound and I feel like a lot groups execute that style very well. It’s fun to see their stages and their outfits. On an aesthetic side, they’re very beautiful people with great fashion. The language is very gorgeous to listen to in music and conversation. I also get a lot of fashion inspiration from Kpop artists’ street/casual wear. They also seem like genuine people. It’s the same reason why I like Ariana grande - I like her music, fashion, and personality a lot."
MurderedByWords,fci4owu,t1_fcgulfa,1577657753.0,"You’ve never felt the need to be protected? Also I’m not talking about sexual attraction here. I’m talking about romantic attraction.. which I guess for some guys is the same thing as romantic? If I’m talking about sexual attraction...then yeah dicks and muscles are great? But romantic attraction would involve the sense of protection, endearment and warmth that you could get from a guy. The romance in somebody caring for you and wanting to protect you. This falls into why girls like guys who are taller and stronger than them too. It’s the sense of protection and warmth. This is also why some straight girls get “girl crushes” on masculine girls. As a straight girl, I don’t understand the romantic attraction a guy could get from a girl, but maybe some guys are only sexually attracted to girls, which is kinda sad. Like try to give me one romantic reason for liking girls that doesn’t involve fucking them"
MurderedByWords,fcglnda,t1_fcgcvrp,1577641428.0,"Men can be beautiful too (or very handsome), I’m a straight girl but I don’t really understand the attraction to non handsome men. But I agree"
