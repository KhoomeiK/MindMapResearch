Reading other things might give you a clearer picture of his opinions, but it’s not really necessary. Enjoy 1984, though! It’s one of my favorite books."
bulletjournal,ff1y7jt,t3_eqzfga,1579488906.0,This is so gorgeous!
bulletjournal,fe9y0ch,t1_fe6lblp,1578942457.0,I did and it was just as amazing as I could’ve hoped.
ACPocketCamp,fdwds6l,t3_en5rp4,1578757654.0,"I try to think of it as a contrast to the snow. “The weather outside is frightful but the fire is so delightful” and all of that! In reality I’m a sucker for this style, so I’m gonna be decking out my camp in knit."
booksuggestions,fdt6nif,t3_emzznu,1578712610.0,"Two Can Keep a Secret by Karen M. McManus had such a great plot twist that even though I knew what was coming while I was rereading it, if felt like I was reading it for the first time. Also The Wife Between Us by Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen had me totally shocked at the twists."
ACPocketCamp,fdt5ttv,t3_en0cd7,1578712301.0,This is such a cool set up! Super relaxing.
booksuggestions,fdt5du5,t1_fdt4s7i,1578712132.0,I read Number the Stars as an assignment in fourth grade and I loved it. It’s really good for that age.
bulletjournal,fdpmsfe,t3_emfg6b,1578633085.0,The sheer page is such a neat idea!
booksuggestions,fdpm9gu,t3_emli4j,1578632622.0,"When I was in first grade I LOVED the Magic Tree House books! They’re not so much “life lessons” as they are fun education, but all I know is that they were my favorites."
unt,fdphobz,t3_emi1jd,1578628899.0,"I’ve had the 7 day basic flex this year and so far it’s perfect. I set a spending limit on myself of $10 a week, so by the end of the year (when I was getting tired of the dining halls) I had plenty of money to spend and it worked out really well."
bulletjournal,fdpdcxj,t1_fdott0s,1578625767.0,I know!! I’m in college in north Texas and I’m dreaming of a snowy day because I KNOW it’s possible. Unfortunately I’m thinking it won’t be happening this year.
bulletjournal,fdpd323,t1_fdp15g3,1578625577.0,Oh that’s a good idea!!
bulletjournal,fdnuoek,t3_emcgzh,1578593200.0,"An aesthetic that my Texas soul can only dream of! Also, that spread looks really cool!"
bulletjournal,fdcv7zd,t3_ekkmzd,1578285264.0,This is such an interesting and wholesome idea!!
ACPocketCamp,fdcis01,t3_ekg46d,1578275933.0,"This looks so good!! Also, you totally helped me realize what these chairs remind me of - they look almost exactly like the chairs that were in the library next to my high school!"
bulletjournal,fd2pcys,t3_eju96w,1578150422.0,"I have an account for my bullet journal, and I really like it! I mostly use it to hold me accountable on actually finishing spreads, as well as getting more ideas and inspiration! My main suggestion would be make sure you’re still creating for you, not your audience. Likes, followers, and comments aren’t what matters - your enjoyment does. I know a lot of accounts that are very focused on gaining attention, which honestly just takes some of the fun out of it. Sorry this was super long, and let me know what your account is if you decide to make it!"
ACPocketCamp,fd08ihq,t3_ejpcy2,1578115220.0,"I’ve been running into this issue too!! Especially after the second anniversary time period where they brought everything back - that bankrupted me of reissue material and I think I’ll be trying to rebuild my stash until the third anniversary! I don’t need every item, but please Nintendo!"
unt,fcorv6y,t3_ei8xr4,1577839871.0,"I’m a freshman at Joe Greene this year, and I really love it! I think the setup inside is great, and I’ve gotten used to the location on campus (I like walking, so distance doesn’t bother me). It’s only a block away from the union and is right next to Kerr (one of the dining halls), so it’s very convenient. I’m not really able to compare it to anything, but I’d totally recommend Joe Greene! Also, welcome to the mean green family!"
ACPocketCamp,fcn7bj4,t1_fcmt44i,1577805150.0,"It’s one of the characters special items! I don’t remember who, though."
ThriftStoreHauls,fchtkbq,t3_ehaf2c,1577653965.0,This is super close to the star my family has. I hope you enjoy it!
bulletjournal,fcb8rjd,t1_fcb5des,1577583841.0,Thank you!
unt,fcb0c4s,t3_egyf87,1577580155.0,"I’m at Joe Greene right now, and I really like it! I like how it’s set up (with the pod system), and I don’t mind where it is on campus. For me it’s worked out really well."
bulletjournal,fcakwk3,t1_fcak8u7,1577571227.0,"Thank you! The color in the middle is watercolor, and the rest is just various pens."
bulletjournal,fcaiqwn,t1_fcaglp4,1577569944.0,Thank you!
bulletjournal,fc5mqb2,t1_fc4o9z5,1577461653.0,"Oh yeah, I like the subtle Valentine’s Day idea!"
bulletjournal,fc5mp6v,t1_fc4ynuv,1577461631.0,Oh I didn’t even think of it being a leap year! That’s smart!
wholesomememes,fbz98z7,t3_ef4nj0,1577239091.0,"My mom actually just preached about this tonight. The first Christmas was anything but the Pinterest-ready Christmas, so why is there so much pressure around the holidays to be perfect? This season should be about love and kindness, not about feeling forced to check all the right boxes and do all the right things. Merry Christmas, and have a good day anyway if you don’t celebrate!"
