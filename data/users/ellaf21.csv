thebachelor,ff5qfch,t3_erpixg,1579606030.0,I‚Äôm currently scheduling a Bachelor Monday post for next Monday for my university‚Äôs bar Facebook page and I‚Äôm absolutely using this meme for it. The people really do love Bachelor memes üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
ExOnTheBeach,ff4rht2,t3_eri8my,1579570686.0,Had to ask myself who Magdalena was.
nextfuckinglevel,ff1wbk4,t3_er2kzl,1579487647.0,"My favourite part of this massive snowstorm was watching my Facebook flood with photos of all the Townies helping each other dig their vehicles and driveways out, clicking through photos of people having a bonfire in the middle of the road downtown, the video of someone snowboarding down Waterstreet, and the lady who had to use a skidoo to get to the hospital to give birth. I live on the west coast of NL and we‚Äôre actually LOW on snow, especially for our ski hill which is still waiting to open a few runs."
FloribamaShore,fdrvvyo,t1_fdqyrkd,1578690529.0,"I remember her talking about him back in season one or two, as well."

ExOnTheBeach,fdbrgu1,t1_fd6my9e,1578260850.0,"Season 1,2, and 4 should be the only seasons. 3 is an embarrassment."
bipolar,fd5frjv,t3_ek1jib,1578177211.0,"Our grade system looks the exact same, weeeeird. I‚Äôm in NL, Canada. I‚Äôm also hella proud of you!"
MtvChallenge,fd4ddhr,t3_ejzbbi,1578166563.0,"If you have an Apple device, you can watch season 16,17,18 (it‚Äôs $9.99 a season or something similar), and then 19 onwards is on MTV.ca, assuming you‚Äôre in Canada. I‚Äôm still looking for a way to get seasons prior to 16 :("

bipolar,fcs6bq5,t1_fcs2g98,1577912047.0,"When I was younger, I had a bad habit of never taking my meds with consistency! I was the same way with birth control pills (took them for a very short period anyway, I get migraines from the estrogen and switched to a Mirena). When I was diagnosed with bipolar, my Psychiatrist said I needed to get consistent with meds or they weren‚Äôt going to work so I desperately wanted to do whatever I could to make the process work. The first half of 2019 was bad for my health and meds, but I kept taking them and having them adjusted. I think I kind of tricked myself into believing in a placebo effect? Even though they WERE working and I couldn‚Äôt necessarily feel it. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it. I definitely think getting put on Lithium at the end of May and talking to my doctor about expectations put me on the right path for the rest of 2019. I wouldn‚Äôt say I felt more hopeful or less manic, but like I was in the middle of the road between manic and depressed in a comfortable middle ground. Feeing less unpredictable kept me taking my meds regularly :)"
bipolar,fcrpk7r,t3_eilu3r,1577904904.0,"The important message here is that you can take your meds as prescribed all you want and still not have a good time, especially for those new to the subreddit who may have been recently diagnosed. Trial and error is a real thing and it‚Äôs super common to see what works and what doesn‚Äôt for Bipolar. I was given a med that didn‚Äôt work for me last February which led to my worst manic episode to date with psychosis so bad I tried to drop out of university and go to law school. If your meds aren‚Äôt working, don‚Äôt quit them cold turkey!!!! Speak to your doctor honestly and openly, get them changed, and see how that works for you. If you feel like you‚Äôre trapped in an endless cycle of not finding meds that work for you please don‚Äôt give up. It gets better, and if you ever need support please reach out. It has been six months since my last episode which was depressive, but I‚Äôm currently on 1200mg Lithium and 200mg Quetiapine and I have never felt so stable in my life. Looking forward to getting weaned off Quetiapine starting at my next visit!"

MtvChallenge,fc3ef1o,t1_fc3dy8a,1577387969.0,"I use Apple TV app but the seasons are $9.99 mostly, also MTV.ca.  I wish more older seasons were available (if anyone sees this and knows where to find them HMU but Amazon Prime Video doesn‚Äôt work in Canada)."
MtvChallenge,fc3e12k,t1_fc3dy8a,1577387726.0,"I have been biting the bullet and purchasing them on Apple TV app for my iPhone. It‚Äôs around $9.99 a season but I am a fool, so here we are hahaha."
MtvChallenge,fc289cm,t1_fc2626n,1577345116.0,"I just finished the Island and holy shit, if I watched these few seasons before the Duel and then season 20 onwards, I doubt I would have kept with it."
MtvChallenge,fc25mqn,t1_fc25kkd,1577341469.0,"This season is making me like Wes, I kind of regret going back and watching old seasons on Apple TV because the way that people talk to each other is disgusting."
MtvChallenge,fc0wnib,t3_efi4bk,1577301658.0,"The comments from other challengers are pretty funny, too. Nice that people can put aside their shit with each other and have a laugh üòÇ"
