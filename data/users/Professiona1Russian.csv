holdmyfeedingtube,fej8xjn,t3_ep7r6h,1579162015.0,Not sure if this was mentioned but that’s why in the US natural gas companies purposely scent their gas.  It’s made to smell like rotten eggs by a chemical called mercaptan.

AskMen,fd3ia62,t3_ejpr7t,1578158563.0,It’s sometimes tough to find a changing station in a men’s room.  Many times I’ve had to ask someone to watch the women’s room for me while I was in there changing a diaper.
CasualConversation,fcup3dn,t3_eipy4z,1577985669.0,One of the best things you can do.  The amount of time you get back is more than enough of a reason. You don’t realize how many hours are spent on social media until you get it back.
PeopleBeingJerks,fblzp3m,t1_fblyfyt,1576974492.0,"I really can’t believe I’m explaining this.  So you are telling me, a lowly employee at an office building where my company resides on one of 6 floors, to move the ashtray, that isn’t my company’s property.  Or Seek out the property manager to have a chat with them about ashtray placement.  Rather than a few people just have some common courtesy?  Are you seeing the lack of logic there?  It’s the same as other shit posted on this sub, people not returning grocery carts or leaving garbage on store shelves.  If you don’t like the content posted then why follow the sub?  Tell ya what, why don’t you come out of your way and pick the butts up.  Then seek out the property manager and ask them to move the ashtray away from where the majority smoke, to appease a few morons who are too stupid to follow everyone else’s lead.  Great idea.  I just can’t believe some of the responses here, I feel like I’m taking dipshit pills."
