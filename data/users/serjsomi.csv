Like another poster said, a typical chop shop would have a mechanical or paint shop front. Where ""real customers"" go in and out..


Then real issue comes when he wants to stop working with them.  That would make him a liability.

She was however commenting on my weight on occasion.. mind you I have never left the healthy range on a BMI scale, but menopause is a bitch. I once told her that it wasn't very nice that she made those comments, that I obviously know what I look like.  She has never said a word about it again. Even though I gained another 10 lbs (still healthy BMI thank goodness). 

It's time to tell Mom, not only does it hurt your feelings, it's none of her business how you keep your hair.  And frankly, the wording she is using does not sound like she's trying to be helpful. Quite the opposite, it sounds mean spirited. 

I'd tell her it's good she cancelled her flight, because you really don't want her around if she in going to make mean comments about your appearance. That and taking care of a new born is enough work without having to clean up after her too.

I am sympathetic to your dad's concern that you are out there every night. He/they may be worried you are isolating yourself from the family, or that something deeper is going on, or C: you are staying somewhere else entirely.

I think your best bet is to reiterate that you are only sleeping out there because A: you really enjoy it, and B: you sleep better because the baby keeps you awake. Let him know that when the baby starts to sleep better, you'll go back to sleeping in the house a little more often. 

If he is concerned for your safety, maybe offer to take something like a baby monitor or two way radio out there with you"

Don't over water them. I water mine about once a week, and not a real soaking, just a light water. Not too much sunlight. Mine are all in indirect light. 

I would take those stringy ones and put them in soil or water to make more pothos. I find it works best if there are at least 3 leaves (or the bumps where a leaf would be) on each stem I plant. You can cut one long one into several small ones to make a new plant. It takes some time, but I have 5 really nice plants now, and two new ones I'm still waiting to fill out.

So I found where you say with utilities you pay about 2k a month. You are really overcharging your mom.  Say you split the rent down the middle 1k each, but she's only there about 1/3 of the time at most (taking into consideration vacation and days off) the very most you should charge is $300 a month.  

If you take into consideration that you spend weekends at their beach house (the taxes, upkeep and utilities on a beach home are probably more than you pay for rent), at the end of the month, you'd probably owe them money if they wanted to charge you.

So, unless you are hurting for money, and mom was trying to help you out by subsidising your rent, YTA


I have a feeling this is going to hurt your relationship with your parents. Especially reading your comments where you really don't accept any of the judgment you're receiving. I think you should stay away from the beach house for a while. It doesn't help your cause whatsoever."
