selfimprovement,ff6si02,t3_errud0,1579633961.0,"I feel this comment only for me it's 10 years not just 3.   10 years ago there were things I could have done differently but at the time I thought I was making the right decision.  More specifically there were a couple of things I wanted to do but thought I couldn't due to lack of money and time.   Looking back on it now I realize that I actually could have done those things and would be in a better situation now as a result.  

So what I am focusing on now is thinking about what I am currently assuming that I can't do because of seemingly good reasons and really challenge myself as to whether or not I really can't do those things.   I don't want to look back 10 years from now and realize that I could have done those things after all.

In short, take the feeling you have now about 3 years ago and focus on doing what you can currently to not have that same feeling 3 years from now."
selfimprovement,ff5cpsq,t3_erp4xf,1579587484.0,"It sounds like you're not so much anti-social as socially anxious.  And that when you drink you lose your inhibitions and don't worry as much.   There's a reason why alcohol is called liquid courage.  But being courageous doesn't mean not being afraid, it means being afraid and doing it anyway.    Maybe that's what you do, acknowledge your anxiety, don't try and do anything about it, but just accept that discomfort and be social anyway.   In fact, maybe the most practical thing you can do is literally pretend you are drunk but don't actually drink.  ie, when you are in a situation where you would be drunk and the life of the party, just do whatever it is you do but don't actually drink to do it.   It will feel super weird at first, but once you break through that initial internal awkward feeling, I'd be willing to bet that you'll be in your groove."

washingtondc,ff0floz,t1_fez25ow,1579468419.0,"So having worked at DCPS and gone to fairfax county public schools myself, let me just say this is too simplistic and doesn't really match reality.    Virginia schools have a floor of quality and a top end that is definitely higher than DCPS: ie their worst schools are better than the worst schools at DCPS and same thing for their best schools.   

For the mass in the middle, it's a lot more complicated.   Part of the reason we moved from virginia into DC is that, at least for the elementary and middle school they would have gone to in VA, the school that my kids go to here in DC is massively better than the one they would have gone to in virginia.    Peer group, resources, parents, even the facility.  I thank god we had the foresight to move into the city.  

Now, we live in NE near the booming H st corridor.  But the way things are moving is that DC is getting richer and significant areas of fairfax are getting poorer, relatively speaking.   Add that to the fact that the school is walking distance and the quality of life here is so much better than it was for us in the suburbs.  

Having said all this, high school is a different situation.   We still have some years to go but I know that as things stand there are only a few fairfax county high schools which I would send my kids to and only two or three DCPS high schools I would trust.

But my high school experience is a little skewed since I went to TJ.  So I honestly have no idea what a regular public highschool is like and from what i gather, it is much different than TJ."
getdisciplined,feqg64n,t3_eq96el,1579341450.0,"When you say you avoid confrontation, I wonder if that may be because you are afraid of fear?  ie, when you feel afraid, that seems to you like something is wrong and so you try and avoid that.  Very normal, that's how fear is designed.  The problem is that we are no longer cavemen but our fear reflexes still drive us as if there was a potential tiger lurking behind any rustle in the brush.  

What you may want to try is stop trying to figure out how not to be afraid and practice bravery instead.  That is to say, feel the fear, accept the fact that you are afraid, and do it anyway.  Don't try and ""convince"" yourself that your fear is unfounded.   Making a rational argument to an emotional decision is taking a knife to a gun fight.   Instead just accept that you will be afraid, there is nothing you can do to not be afraid, and just do it anyway."

And speaking of being 22, I did go to college but made a few bad decisions in my 20's resulting in my being 30 yo, broke, and unemployed living in my parents basement.  And by broke I mean literally not enough money to go to mcdonalds.   

To my credit and help from relatives, I buckled down and paid down the $70K+ in debt.  I still have my debt tracking spreadsheet showing how I paid it off over 3 years.   Now (46)  I still feel behind due to that lost decade but I'm making good money and have a lot of great things going for me including starting a couple of businesses.

selfimprovement,feh55mo,t3_ep1vma,1579109356.0,"The problem with your situation is that you have internalized what you've heard.  To the point that I'd be willing to bet that if you heard someone give you 10 compliments and 1 criticism you would focus on the criticism because you've been conditioned to believe that ""negative"" = ""true"".   

The thing you need to do is not necessarily remind yourself that other people are wrong about you but remind yourself that YOU are wrong about you.   Or more specifically, that your feelings about your worth are not an accurate measure of the reality of your worth.   At some level you've started to believe that your lack of worth is reality though intellectually you know that is not true.   But fighting feelings with rational arguments is bringing a knife to a gun fight.   You'll never ""convince"" yourself so don't try.   

Instead, you should be brave,  your mantra should be ""do it anyway"".   You feel like you cannot take that class because you're not smart enough?  Do it anyway.   You feel like you cannot move to that new city?  do it anyway.  You can't talk to that person you find attractive?  do it anyway.    But your only measure of success should be ""was I brave"".   Don't worry about the quality of your achievements for now because that's not what is holding you back.   Focus on the fear you feel and every time you do something when you are scared, THAT is a win.  THAT is a real win and the only path to success for anyone.    Eventually bravery will become a habit and you will develop confidence as a reward.   Do that enough and eventually you will encounter something that sticks and that you will start to be good at.   But that's the icing on the cake of bravery.

AskMen,fefjh1l,t3_eow3mn,1579057615.0,"Babies are terrible.  You just pour energy, time, and attention and it seems like it goes nowhere.   But the first time your kid gives you a hug and pats you on the back while doing so...it makes it all worth it.  At 20 months, you're probably just on the cusp with your older child.   And once they really start talking, it's wonderful.   You just got to last through the annoying baby stage.  In fact, I'm not so sure you would have had that much different an experience iwith your older child even if you hadn't had to deal with your dad's passing.

getdisciplined,fe9cv5x,t1_fe6qfne,1578936445.0,"It's good to have high standards but the point is not to make the high standards arbitrary.  A perfectionist gets nervous when even something minor is not done well but not being a perfectionist doesn't mean that you do everything poorly.   It means you do things as good as they need to be so that some things are done nearly perfectly and other things are done imperfectly but good enough.

In your building example, not taking shortcuts and having high standards is in service of the goal of building that tower more stable.  If each floor is built at a slight slope then as you add levels the tower will lean.   But if a certain floor is built slightly out of square you can correct that in the next floor and cover the imperfection when you put the outer shell on.   So you need to get each floor perfectly level but you don't have to get each floor perfectly square."

One of the ""benefits"" of addiction is a certain clarity in that you never have to figure out what to do.  You have a goal in mind, which is to get the next fix.   

Unfortunately, real life is not that black and white.  But that's actually the great thing about it.   Your 20's is a blank sheet of paper.   A blank sheet of paper is both scary and exciting.   Scary because we are programmed to want to know when we are doing the right thing, exciting when we realize that it's actually up to us to decide what the right thing is.

That excitement you feel could lead you to success beyond the actual course if you think outside the box.  For example, it is not unlikely that your professor is teaching that subject because they really enjoy it themselves.  So while you are correct that you should probably try and tame your excitement enough so you can actually turn in the assignment, it may also be a good idea to talk to your professor and tell/show him the other thoughts you have which may not fit in the space of the assignment.   I'm sure at the very least he will feel very gratified that you are getting so much out of the course but it could also be that he could give you some advice or even a special project that will allow you free reign for your ideas.

So you've already shown you have what it takes.

I would also suggest that you see if there are any meetup groups in the area.  The bigger, the better so you feel more anonymous as that makes it easier to be a fly on the wall rather than have a lot of attention put on yourself when you're not ready for it.  They often have people present things and that could spur ideas for what you want to look into.     When you are ready to decloak, they are pretty uniformly super supportive as well.   People who go through the trouble of starting a meetup group are usually passionate about the topic and also somewhat outgoing which is a good combination for someone like you to seek advice from.

So don't try and fight it, with the implication that it is an obstacle that you need to destroy or you will be prevented from moving.   Instead accept fear as an increase in the incline of the hill you are climbing with the implication that it will never go away entirely and eventually you will not even notice it but for now you have to put in a little more effort.

A lot of tiredness and the resulting cravings come from dehydration rather than really needing energy.  A good rule of thumb is to every day drink 0.5 oz of water for every pound you weigh.

Really well done, congratulations.   Give yourself a well-deserved pat on the back.    I can't emphasize enough how good it is that you've taken that step because now you go from being helpless to being in charge.  

So what do you actually do now?   The first thing to realize is that you need to change your actions before you change your belief.  ie, it's not a matter of ""convincing yourself"" that you are not incompetent.  I can't put links here but look in my profile for my blog on medium and read my post about self-confidence.   Essentially self-confidence is a reward you get after taking a risk not a pre-requisite you need before taking a risk.  You fight fear with bravery, not confidence.   You fight your fear of failure with the bravery of getting up again after you fall.    

Related to that, the other thing you should realize is that you are not really that messed up as compared to the rest of us.  It's not like you are the only one who feels incompetent and fucks things up because you're afraid of fucking things up.   When you compare yourself to other people to see where you ""should be"", realize that you are not comparing apples to apples.   You see the messy details of your own life, compare that with the outward perfection of a role model, and it's impossible to see how your actual messiness could result in that perfect outcome.   

This is because when we see someone achieve an outcome we desire for ourselves the logical thing we do is try and figure out what the right steps are to get to that outcome.   So by definition we are only thinking of the correct things they did.   But the reality is that they made a lot of mistakes and hit a lot of dead ends.   The difference between success and failure is not succeeding all the time, it is persevering when you fail.  So when you imagine what someone must have done to achieve something, imagine them falling, brushing themselves off, and getting back up.

selfimprovement,fcd5xjv,t3_egtf61,1577606761.0,"One thing you should realize is that when you compare yourself to other people you are not making an apples to apples comparison.   Here is a post I made earlier on the subject:

Comparing ourselves with ""successful"" people is incredibly discouraging because we are comparing apples and oranges.  

We do not have that much information about what it took for them to achieve success.  But we have full information on the messy reality of our own lives, what we have or have not done. We see all our flaws, all our base motivations, all the mistakes we have made.

We have a much more complete picture of ourselves and it’s that detail that discourages us. The messy reality of our actual process can never hold a candle to our perfect ideal set of steps we imagine our role model took to achieve success. 

This comparison robs us of the ability to persevere because all our flaws are real. All our mistakes did happen. And if we compare those flaws and mistakes to this idealized version of another person’s success we are always going to be found wanting. It seems impossible that we can achieve the same success.

So what to do? How do we get around this?

The difference between success and failure doesn’t come down to doing every step successfully, it comes down to persevering when you do a step unsuccessfully.

We can use the end point of other people as a goal, as an aiming point, we can imagine the successful steps they took in order to guide ourselves but we can’t use that as a comparison for \*how well\* we are doing, only for \*what\* we should be doing. Focus not on the quality of their execution but on the nature of what the steps are.

In order to do this, in order to connect their successful reality to our own actual reality, we still try and work out the successful steps executed by our successful role model but we must also imagine them going through exactly the trials and tribulations, the mistakes and bad decisions that we are dealing with.   And we imagine them pushing through to success just like we are going to.

It almost doesn’t matter if they actually did encounter those same trials, we are not judging them, we are simply using them as a model to emulate and as such we are just fleshing out that model with the good \*and\* the bad so that it becomes more realistic and more relevant to our own lives.

We go from thinking that only what we do correctly matters to a more holistic view that aiming for success and persevering through failure are both equally important.  Only once we view success as something that comes from a real, messy, contradictory, actual human life can we implement it in our own real, messy, contradictory, actual human life."
selfimprovement,fbsce9b,t3_ee1981,1577053293.0,"Very few people could answer the question of what they really want.   It's not just a therapy thing, so don't feel like you're weird because of that.  It's normal.   

The problem is that we are trained to perform according to external standards.   And very reasonably so, getting benefits from society requires meeting its external standards, so that's not inherently a bad thing.   If our goal is to be happy I would argue that clarity is more important (and easier to achieve) than correctness and external standards have the advantage of being clear.   

Unfortunately, once you start to question them, you can't go back.   You can't unsee the arbitrariness of these externally imposed goals.  

The key to get back to happiness is to let go of this as a value judgement.  There is nothing inherently better about either external standards or about plotting your own course.  However you have to use the right measure.  

External standards are clear, they have ""right"" answers.  Your own course is not, so by using that same measure you stress yourself out because that path will never achieve the same surety.  The benefit of plotting your own course is satisfaction, so that should be the measure you use.  

By your question it seems you are still hoping to achieve that same safety and clarity that you had when you had a specific goal to work towards.   Instead I would cultivate the sense of curiosity that a kid has, even if your childhood may not have allowed it yourself.   

That means getting comfortable with the uncertainty of not knowing whether something is what you are meant to do and just really paying attention to whether or not you are enjoying something or not.  That's the only measure that matters now."
