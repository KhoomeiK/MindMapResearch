Advice,ffbcpza,t3_esoftz,1579759859.0,"If there's vomit or foam coming from the mouth, immediately turn him to his side to increase his airflow. Call 911 right away and they'll tell you what to do over the phone. The big thing with a drug overdose is that they need adrenaline administered to their heart, and that's something paramedics have to do. 

If there's nothing coming from the mouth and the airway is clear, do CPR chest compressions. Breaths aren't as important as compressions, so that's the main focus. If he starts to come around, you can also put him in the shower with cold water; the shock of it will make them inhale sharply, but if he's unresponsive keep doing compressions. 

If you're really worried for him, you'll probably want to make sure he's not left alone. Which is essentially a 2nd job for you and unfair. I would really say to talk to his family so that they dont get a call from a police officer saying that their son overdosed and is in the hospital. That's a call no one ever wants to get."

childfree,feue86y,t3_eqgksf,1579385670.0,If there was a fetal test to determine if their kid was going to be born gay or trans or an atheist they'd all be pro-choice in an instant. Their whole ideal is a joke.

childfree,fepinxc,t3_eqayu4,1579321486.0,"So my great aunt actually never had children. I'm not sure if it was intentionally or not as I never got to ask her, but I remember she was happy. She was always adoring of me and my brother, but she and her husband would spend a month in Hawaii every year because they could. They had friends in Asia that they'd see and collected Visa stamps as a hobby from different countries. They retired early to a beautiful home on more than enough money to live comfortably. Her husband even had a plane at one point just because he could. You didn't need a license to fly back then and he'd just go to cities in it because he could. My great aunt and uncle had the DINK life down to a science early on."

The kid got so mad that he posted another video calling the guy who parodied him an asshole and a cancer. Where are the parents to monitor these kids? If your kid is that upset easily, then maybe they should stick with Club Penguin and Neo Pets."

Advice,fdj5adu,t3_elmvlh,1578458837.0,"One thing you can do is message your insurance; most are on Facebook or have emails, so you can talk to them that way without actually having to pick up the phone. 

It's been said, but talk to Planned Parenthood. They're a wonderful, nonjudgemental organization that will help you arrange finances. If a place ever doesn't have the word clinic in the title, avoid it like the plague. Those are fake clinics called crisis pregnancy centers that try to shame people out of aborting or delay it. 

There are charities that will send you the abortion pill for a donation of your choice, but if you're more than 9 weeks pregnant, you'll have to get a suction abortion."
