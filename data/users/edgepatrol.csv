Put him on a leash and backtie him to something sturdy. (bed, wall, close a door on the leash handle, etc)

Approach him, and when he tries to jump, back away. Say ""ahh!"" to mark the moment he's jumping, which repels you. 

Tell him to Sit. As soon as he does, approach and give him affection! Pet all over him while he Sits. You can also add treats sometimes as a ""jackpot"" for him winning this game. :-) 

If he gets up, back away again. You want him to understand that he's controlling whether or not he gets petted: Sitting gets pets, jumping repels the person. 

If he sneaks a jump in when you're not prepared, turn your back on him and make a sound of disapproval like ""ahhhh"". Don't reward with touching or eye contact. Then, ask for a Sit, and reward that!

They usually catch on to this pretty quickly. Can be done without back-tying of course, but that sets him up to succeed because he can't practice doing it wrong."

Bring high value treats, like freeze-dried liver or beef jerky, broken into tiny pieces. At first, ignore the dog. Act aloof, no touching, no eye contact. Interact with the humans and not the dog(s).

I would get a professional opinion on this one, wrt the risk for humans.  For what it's worth, this is a common type of genetic, impulsive, predatory aggression within bully breeds (although many are also not like this). It has to be managed carefully if the dog is only this way towards dogs/small animals...and imo there's only one choice if the dog will redirect onto humans."
dogs,ff8zt5s,t3_es7uj1,1579701175.0,"You're correct on all points. Most people don't have as much awareness of hierarchy these days, because of the way dogs are commonly kept, at least in the USA. It becomes a lot more obvious when working with packs. The animosity almost certainly has to do with this lack of understanding, coupled with the straw man that social dominance is about violence (instead of Nature's way to prevent violence and keep the pack running smoothly) .

Like humans, dogs interact on many different layers. If you're working with certain behavior problems or with groups of dogs, hierarchy becomes a layer that's approximately as important as operant conditioning. For the average pet owner who has one dog that they keep away from other dogs for the most part, or only allow highly controlled interactions... They're just not going to see the behaviors that pack managers or people who study natural dog behavior will see. That doesn't mean it isn't there... But like Social Development in humans, it's partly inherent and partly developed through practice. A dog raised in a socially deficient environment where he never learns proper social signaling from other dogs will have the same problems as a person who didn't learn social cues. Put a bunch of those dogs together and you're going to see some pretty dysfunctional behavior. Compare that to a pack of feral dogs , or dogs that grew up together in a social setting, and you will get very inconsistent results. Doggie daycare tends to be a mix of socially inept dogs and more savvy dogs. Some of the dogs will want to practice group behaviors , even if they're only there for the afternoon... Huskies are bad for this. That usually drives the single dog people crazy, which is one reason huskies have such a bad reputation at dog parks!

The more layers of canine Behavior we understand, the better off we will be. Canine social structure, operant conditioning, the energy of interactions , the effects of environment , and so on all have their place , if you want to be a truly well-rounded handler."

 The guy who discovered Carolina dogs (Dr. Brisbin) has also been very involved with the New Guinea dogs and their conservation. :-)  Really neat guy; he is a treasure trove of information.
 
Most Carolina dogs out there are not from a feral landrace. There are a very small number of dogs who actually went back to Nature, so to speak. The rest are typically pitbull/husky or lab/shepherd type mixes that ended up in shelters, and the shelter labeled them that to get them adopted as a rare breed."
dogs,fekiw0e,t1_fek7w6s,1579200979.0,"They have a different ""breed profile"", so to speak. You know how German Shepherds and Huskies are both domestic dogs, but it's hard to say which one is more difficult because it depends on what you're good at and what things you don't like to deal with? It's like that.
 
 Singing dogs are extremely gentle with humans, by nature. They aren't typically food aggressive, most of them are naturally good with children when raised with them, the socialized ones love affection and they want to be near people. They're clean dogs, like Chows. They don't bark but they yodel and talk so much that I would not consider them quiet! Lol however, they are Hell on Wheels with other pets. They have a high prey drive and although a rare few have lived successfully with cats, most of them will kill anything small that runs. Some of them have killed things as big as goats. They can't be left to run loose. They need a 6-foot fence with dig skirting and when you take them out they should be on a leash. Most are same-sex aggressive, although there does seem to be a trend where they don't consider some other dogs to be sexual competitors , just dogs of their own or similar breeds, or dogs that ""start it"" by harassing them. Veterinarians tend to hate them because  they are utter drama queens, will scream bloody murder  if you so much as look at them wrong,  and it's a good idea  to muzzle them at the vet just in case. The most similar breeds would probably be Korean Jindo or any of the Nikon Ken breeds (Shibas, Kishu, etc). If they're not socialized as pups, it can take a long time to build their trust.
 
 In my experience and that of  a lot of folks I talk to,  the Australian dingo personality is similar to how I described the New Guinea dogs, except with Husky mixed in. :-)   They are bigger, even friendlier, absolutely insane Escape artists. They can sail a 10-foot fence if they're motivated enough , there needs to be a roof or at least lean ins when they are left outside. And good dig skirting. And can open the latches so you have to put locks on them. And you have to tie the dog houses down or else they push them around like ladders and use them to get out. Have you ever seen that video with the honey badger that kept escaping its enclosure? Dingoes know what he's talking about. :-)   Many of them are same-sex aggressive, most of them are better with other dogs than the singing dogs are though. Prey drive is through the roof. Game pit bull levels of prey drive. Even raised with cats, they will almost always hunt them. (When you think about how they live in the wild, that totally makes sense.)  They are incredible with humans, so so loving and can't get close enough. Super intelligent, love to play games and figure things out. Like any other  dog  they can be taught basic commands and manners, leash trained, crate trained oh, and so on. But keep that safety checked leash on if you are outside of the house or enclosure!  They are way too much dog for most people. Many years ago I had 98% wolves basically as ""pets"" and tbh they were easier than the dingoes, because they are more laid-back and are very conscientious about following social rules. You can tell the dingoes aren't really pack animals in the same way , it's more of a free-for-all."

I have put together some thoughts and information on the topic of ""but we are not dogs"", but I get the impression that you're not reading closely and/or discussing in good faith, so I won't waste your time. The true mechanisms of canine social dominance aren't rocket science and can be explained to most folks with the desire to learn, but coming into the discussion prejudiced against an understanding because of what you read on the internet (without any practical hands-on which would have disproven the current fad) pretty much defeats learning."

Supported by ethologists, sure. [Scientists are aware of the existence of the dominance hierarchy in canids](http://wolfdogproject.com/domquotes.html), and they don't deny its usefulness...especially in working with fractious animals while avoiding unnecessary pain and fear.   That said, I personally didn't mention Cesar specifically, pro or con. Back when he first came out, my assessment of him was that he's a ""one trick pony"" - but it's a very important ""trick"". And to be fair, Cesar isn't training pet dogs, he is working dogs that 99% of people on reddit would euthanise.

Patricia McConnell does understand dominance, although like many, has succumbed to popular pressure and changed some working to avoid making waves. Ditto Suzanne Clothier, Shirley Chong, Karen Overall, etc. Grisha Stewart has some great stuff but focuses on different problems, and her style also dovetails nicely with proper leadership!  Sophia Yin has a great book on veterinary handling, with a ridiculously misrepresented section on ""dominance"" in which she basically said, ""I knocked my dominant dog around and that didn't work, so don't be dominant""...and then goes on to explain how she effectively uses a version of dominance to be a good leader, which makes her a better veterinarian.  ;-)  I'm not speaking ill of the dead; I appreciate some of her writings but she was way of base as a young woman with a difficult dog, which just shows you the depth to which people misunderstand the actual workings of this system (which seems SO simple to me? And was much simpler years ago, before the internet with less bizarre misinformation floating around).  [This collection of links](http://wolfdogproject.com/packlinks.html) may give people a better grasp of it.  Btw, Ian Dunbar understands it as well, and he's included on that list of quotes from scientists I linked about. His wording of the basic concept is **spot-on** and concise. :-)"
dogs,fejxvj1,t1_fejx1hn,1579188340.0,"Case in point.  ""People who say it doesn't work, invariably have never tried it correctly themselves, do not understand the concept, and are using a straw man when they look for flaws"".

Dominance means, understanding the social structure and hierarchy of group-living animals, in order to manage conflict without violence. That's what it evolved to do. Social dominance does NOT involve ""cruelty, fear, or (necessarily even) aversives"".  That's an unbelievable straw man that, tbh, I am a little mind-blown people still cling to, when there are so many resources out there from which to properly understand the context of leading a dog. 

Ethology is absolutely a valid branch of science. (For that matter, so are aversives; they are the other half of operant conditioning. They're not recommended when rehabilitating a seriously dominant dog, though.)  As someone who has worked with large numbers of dominant dogs successfully, I have learned from the dogs directly...and like them, I do ""what works"". Personal success/experience will always trump what strangers on the internet who don't even understand the subject promote.  I just feel bad for newer folks who are fed straw men and are never given the most effective options, because of misrepresentation or ego. 

Solid leadership + positive reinforcement, with a few side dishes like impulse control, indirect access, and controlling the environment, will fix just about anything. That was true 300 years ago and it's still true today; dogs' brains have not changed."
dogs,fejv3vj,t1_fejturb,1579186544.0,"Definitely no pleasing everyone.  ;-D  But the idea that ""visiting dogs are kept separate from resident dogs, although you may make an exception for well trained guest dogs"" is probably about as neutral as you can get!"
dogs,fejswub,t1_fejreuz,1579185053.0,"DNA testing has already proved their origin without a doubt. They are descended from domesticated Asian dogs. [Here are some papers](http://wolfdogproject.com/papers.html) explaining that.

Additionally, domestication causes certain traits to develop in general, including dogs/dingoes. 20% smaller brain size, reduced adrenal response, changes in coat pigmentation (wild animals are agouti, domestics are more solid coloured with white markings such as tail tip, face, chest and paws), faster social and sexual maturation than the wild progenitor, can reproduce out of season (fertile at the wrong time of year & can have multiple cycles), curl to the tail, larger/thinner ears, affinity for eye contact with humans, don't need to be pulled/bottle-fed...  You might enjoy [this paper on domestication syndrome](https://www.genetics.org/content/197/3/795) and the neural crest hypothesis. :-) 

AUS dingoes are still Canis familiaris in their homeland. You see a lot of political activism towards changing it, but no actual legitimate data for a separate subspecies, let alone species. Again, that does NOT mean they aren't valuable! They are a separate landrace, as are NGSD.

The NG dog is almost certainly the ancestor of the Australian dingo.

The reason you see mixed information, is because there's a political movement to rename dingoes as ""a separate species"", in order to afford them more protections under the law. Right now, dingoes are treated horribly as an invasive pest; they are considered mere ""wild dogs"" and competition to the livestock industry, so they're shot and poisoned mercilessly whenever possible.

The owners really need to solve this problem at the root / source, not by trying to get their dog to make an exception for your dog specifically. She needs basic training and LOTS of impulse control. That said, one thing you can do to benefit you and your dog specifically, is to carry really high value treats (like meat or cheese)  when you think you might encounter this dog. Then, get the dog to do **anything** for you, in exchange for a treat. Sit, give you paw, make eye contact, spin in a circle, whatever. The idea is that the dog ""works for you"" part time. If you're around, the dog looks to you for direction (you will eventually ask for a specific behaviour) so she can do a small job/task and get ""paid"". ;-)  You don't have a lot of control over this situation, but you do have some.

Pitbulls are commonly dog-aggressive and prone to allergies, which rescues will expect to some extent...but the bite history against humans (although one sounds completely justified!) could be an issue. You can definitely call bully rescues in your area and get their opinion. Since you're willing to contribute to her care, that probably increases her options somewhat. They will expect you to sign her over, waiving your rights to decisions about her in the future. Definitely look into the rescue's reputation before doing so! Some are great, some not so much. They need to be honest about her behavioural issues, as well -- since some rescues and shelters will lie about that to adopters.

Requiring a behaviour from the dog before giving rewards (not just food rewards, but also walks and attention and such) is very important because it reminds the dog every day that HE works for YOU, and not the other way around.
