I used to try and interpret them because I had the thought. when has a dream ever helped in real life or effected me positively in some way? Never."
depression,ffi1m8t,t3_etp5d7,1579962375.0,"As someone who feels they can relate, my word is don't let yourself become isolated. Even if that help doesn't seem genuine - take it. When people stop trying and you're all alone is when things really get scary. Good luck out there."
depression,ffhvenj,t3_etf99a,1579955698.0,I've been losing my mind since I was 13. You could see how it got progressively worse over each year. Now I'm almost completely isolated. It is terrifying to lose your mind while also being alone. I can sympathize with your desire to check out.
