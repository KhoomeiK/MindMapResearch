That was probably more of a ""we're friends"" thing, but that's not the point. The point is you could do something similar. It's casual conversation and a perfect opportunity to ask for his number. Talk about a hobby or interest of yours and there's something you want to show him, but can't at that time. Later that day you text him the thing and just start chatting after that. My crush and I have texted a lot since then so maybe it'll work for you too."

Crushes,fdzsmw2,t3_enfiby,1578794842.0,"I've been in only one relationship and I was 13 so it wasn't much of a relationship. I'm 17 now and throughout the years I've noticed that I'd have ""crushes"" on people just because I was lonely and would take any form of attention that I could get. It was just my desperation talking. So maybe that's what it's like for you.

I know the crush I have now is genuine because I like everything about him and can't get him off my mind."
Crushes,fdzqb33,t3_eng4k8,1578793331.0,"I'd say just tell him. If he knows about your anxiety then he'll think that it's pretty courageous of you for telling him. If he says no and you're ok with that and still want to be friends with him, then reassure him that nothing's going to be awkward between you two and you won't try to pursue him if he doesn't want that. If he doesn't know how he feels about those circumstances, then give him some time to think about it before talking to him again as a friend.

And anybody can and will love you regardless of what you look like. Is appearance a factor of attraction? Yes. But it is not what determines if someone loves you. That's something that is found through personality, experiences, conversations, just having that special bond. If someone loves you, but doesn't like the body that you're in then they aren't someone that is worth your time. When you're with someone that loves you, then they love all of you, and they will make you feel like the most beautiful person in the world. But you have to accept your own unique beauty and love yourself first because you deserve to be happy with who you are, and not have self criticism."
