AskReddit,fdfmcps,t3_e0i3lt,1578365031.0,Raising Kangaroos as pets. My family lives on a farm in South Australia and we have many relatives who live on other farms and it wasn’t uncommon for people to hunt kangaroos despite it being illegal. Assholes. Sometimes my grandma who lives across from me would get a call saying a mother kangaroo has been shot but the Joey survived. We always took them in and raised them as identical as we could to a kangaroos upbringing. They are very friendly when raised by humans they even played with our dogs I raised a few in my childhood but thankfully hunting on kangaroos while not gone has slimmed. Those we raised we let go into the wild when they became way bigger than us. They never run off until they know it’s time. I didn’t even realise raising them was illegal until last week.

TheMandalorianTV,fbjj59z,t3_edewqj,1576934525.0,"I haven’t seen the Rise of Skywalker so u may be referencing something specific but force healing has actually been used way back to the original force users. Even the dark side can force heal, Darth Bane and Darth Plagueis could even use advanced forms to extend their lives. Plagueis took it one step further and could even create life as a whole from midi chlorians (which is why there are theories he’s Anakin’s indirect dad) in Legends Luke Skywalker even learnt how to force heal.
Edit: in canon he’s the first to be shown doing it but Plagueis is hinted at using it earlier just in a different way."
