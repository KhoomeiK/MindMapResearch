I agree with lower taxes on businesses (although I want to raise them on high-earning individuals), but ""deregulation"" is a scam on the common people. Regulations aren't some evil thing that just exist to hurt businesses, they are there to keep businesses from fucking everyone over."

Dallas,fdp10xb,t1_fdo96mh,1578617446.0,"Here's the exact wording of the Capital Punishment part of the extradition treaty ( [http://www.oas.org/juridico/MLA/en/traites/en\_traites-ext-usa-mex.pdf](http://www.oas.org/juridico/MLA/en/traites/en_traites-ext-usa-mex.pdf)  Article 8):

*When the offense for which extradition is requested is punishable by death under the laws of the requesting Party and the laws of the requested Party do not permit such punishment for that offense, extradition may be refused unless the requesting Party furnishes such assurances as the requested Party considers sufficient that the death penalty shall not be imposed, or, if imposed, shall not be executed.*

IANAL but I think that means we could execute him as long as it isn't for the same ""offenses"" that he was extradited for. Although Mexico probably wouldn't like it if we did."
Dallas,fdp0cje,t1_fdni7bu,1578616995.0,"I was curious about this so I looked up the official treaty:  [http://www.oas.org/juridico/MLA/en/traites/en\_traites-ext-usa-mex.pdf](http://www.oas.org/juridico/MLA/en/traites/en_traites-ext-usa-mex.pdf)

It says that *for an offense committed outside the territory of the requesting Party, the requested Party shall grant extradition if:*

*a) its laws would provide for the punishment of such an offense committed in similar circumstances or*

*b) the person sought is a national of the requesting Party, and that Party has jurisdiction under its own laws to try that person*

If I'm understanding it correctly, that means that if this guy is an American citizen rather than a Mexican citizen, we can still use the death penalty. I assumed he was a Mexican national because he fled to Mexico, but the article doesn't actually specify.

&#x200B;

edit: nevermind, I kept reading and Article 8 actually has more specifics on Capital Punishment:

*When the offense for which extradition is requested is punishable by death under the laws of the requesting Party and the laws of the requested Party do not permit such punishment for that offense, extradition may be refused unless the requesting Party furnishes such assurances as the requested Party considers sufficient that the death penalty shall not be imposed, or, if imposed, shall not be executed.*"

Why the fuck was a murder suspect with means to flee the country allowed out on bond?"
