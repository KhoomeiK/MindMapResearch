Please wash everything in hot water and wash your hands frequently. Most OTC meds don't work but if you go to a pet store, you want to get the dewormer made by Bayer. Follow the directions and deworm again in 6 weeks. It's just called Bayer Tapeworm Cat Dewormer. You also need to super clean the litter box so you don't reinfest."

blursedimages,fe61c3f,t1_fe61375,1578879582.0,"Yes, that was part of the reason he got off. For example, after his blood ssmple was taken, instead of logging it immediately, it was taken to the detectives at the crime scene which gave some clout to the defense saying he was framed. I don't believe he was but it was enough to give the jurors reasonable doubt."

Plus the latex gloves would make it difficult to slip the glove on. There are pictures of him wearing those same gloves before the murders. There were also pictures of him wearing the same hat the killer left behind.

But I thought the most damming piece of evidence was the DNA. There were 3 sets of DNA found at the crime scene...Nicole's, Ron's and OJs"
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fe5zcqb,t1_fe5uykl,1578878310.0,"Oh I totally get it, my son had a rare neurotransmitter disease and there's no way we could have afforded a service dog. We had a dog that was great for him, provided a lot in terms of sensory input and helped with his physical therapy sessions. I know that emotional service dogs have value, a lot of value. It's the people who abuse the laws and bring their untrained pets into public spaces that bother me. At Walmart this woman had a Doberman that was clearly super stressed out and not socialized at all. His tail was tucked and his ears were back and he was shaking at times. After talking to her, she said it was an emotional support dog. So not a service dog. She's doing her dog and anyone in the store a huge disservice and that's how service dogs get a bad rep. I didn't at all mean that your dog was not needed or invaluable in any way, just that the laws that cover the two are different. Sorry if it came off differently, ESAs are amazing"
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fe55xwm,t1_fe55h7k,1578865937.0,"""Sometimes, people mistake emotional support dogs for psychiatric service dogs. An emotional support animal simply provides the owner with a therapeutic presence. These animals aren’t trained to perform any tasks. This is because their presence is meant to mitigate any psychological or emotional symptoms you may be experiencing."""
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fe55py6,t1_fe55h7k,1578865876.0,"Right, but just their presence alone doesn't qualify as a service dog, it has to be trained to do one of those things."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fe4xd9k,t1_fe4u1fo,1578863704.0,So your dog would be an emotional support dog and isn't covered under the same rights as a service dog. You can get a service dog for mental disorders but they are usually trained to do a specific task like fetching emergency medication. Just the presence of a dog helping falls under the emotional support animal.
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fe4u10x,t1_fe4sqiv,1578862752.0,"Right but there's no official documentation needed to have a service animal, you aren't allowed to ask what it's specifically trained to do nor are you allowed to ask what the disability is. So without a registry or documentation, anyone can claim a dog is a service animal and there isn't anything a business owner can do about it."

BoJackHorseman,fe0c5x6,t1_fdzucqc,1578809405.0,"I agree, I really thought it romanticized suicide and knowing how bad I was bullied in middle school, a show like this may have been a tipping point towards trying to end my life. I felt that way because she seemed to get justice by committing suicide, she got her revenge on all the popular kids. That kind of message would have really resonated with me as a kid, and wtih poor impulse control and inability to make good choices, I can see how the show might contribute to some bad outcomes."
AskReddit,fe09nu9,t1_fdu2ngg,1578807001.0,"I don't have a concern with touch DNA, but it seems like the DNA in that particular case was either fake or planted because the amount of DNA found was in such a large quantity. There's an article about it here
