**VW owns Porsche**. **** There are certain keys that are the same and you can buy from a VW dealer to replace lost ones, and it's usually cheaper to do so. However, this is a joke towards Porsche people in reality owning a VW since they are the same company.

Also, serious repost."

VIZIO_Official,fdmr5pi,t3_em4te1,1578561705.0,I believe the default is 0000 or 1111 if you haven't tried that. Otherwise call Visio the might be able to push a reset.
VIZIO_Official,fdmqg3s,t3_em15n7,1578560707.0,"I had this problem with HDR10 from the HTPC (AMD 2400G though a Denon X2400 set to Enhanced and By-pass) 2 updates ago. Had to turn the Backlight, Contrast *and* Color up to 80. Even the Smartcast apps seemed darker, though not nearly as bad, Backlight 70 and Contrast 65. I tried Factory Reset but didn't fix it. Strangely the Xbox X was unaffected.

After this last 5.0 update, I tried a 'Soft Reset' (Like /u/toonj64 means, I think) and it worked. Not as quite as bright as it was, but Backlight is down to 60 and Contrast is 55 on the HTPC for HDR, and Backlight, Contrast and Color for HDR10/HDR10+/HLG through the Smartcast apps are default. DV is still darker than the others, but is fixed with Backlight and Contrast at 60. Gamma set to 2.1, with Brightness backed off to 48 to compensate for the increased Contrast. Even in demos I've noticed DV is darker than HDR10, so not too worried.

You are correct about the Mandalorian being 'fake DV' and really dark. The problem, I think, is that the DV tags are being seen by the TV but no actual luminance data (at least not through my HTPC), so it's just 'dark'."

One thing I did notice though, and I don't know when it happened, but I am now getting Atmos in Prime Video through ARC from the TV as well. Noticed while watching Carnival Row. Could have been there all along, but never noticed."
