ehlersdanlos,ffdy6uv,t1_ffcn39t,1579831867.0,I started falling apart at age 50 and finally diagnosed at age 58.
PlasticSurgery,fewo2ky,t3_eqk23t,1579416604.0,"I took arnica before both of my total knee replacements as recommended by my surgeon and I had very little bruising. This is a tough surgery and I also have Ehlers Danlos Symdrome, a genetic connective tissue disorder where I’m prone to bruising. I works."
ChronicPain,fewn19z,t1_ferzptl,1579415272.0,"This is a new doctor who seems to be strict on prescribing opioids. Even if medical marijuana is legal, don’t go if you will test positive because it will be in your medical records. Once you are established with this doctor, discuss other options if you feel comfortable with her, but show up clean."
ChronicPain,fepna6f,t3_eq3d22,1579325073.0,You may want to write a letter explaining that you idiot husband provided false information about your pain medication abuse and send it to your pain management doctor and any other doctor you are seeing. State that the letter is to be considered part of your medical records. If you had to do urine drug testing at your PM doctor that should indicate you weren’t abusing medications. I did this once when a doctor put ridiculous false information in my records and it was made a part of my records.

SuicideWatch,fe6wwn6,t1_fe6dcvj,1578907031.0,Perhaps this one is a legend in their own mind. Always the smartest person in the room but no one noticed.
SuicideWatch,fe6vorb,t1_fe6skqx,1578906181.0,Great response.
SuicideWatch,fe6vmw4,t1_fe6nbbj,1578906101.0,Are you drunk and on Xanax as well?
SuicideWatch,fe6v0l3,t1_fe6sd1q,1578905774.0,"It’s not going to just land on your lap and drag you away on a magical mystery tour. You kind of have to put a little effort into living the life you want, nobody is going to do it for you. Of course some people just sit and let life happen to them instead of for them."

Fibromyalgia,fe6thd1,t3_eneh0o,1578904706.0,This was one of the worst medications I’ve ever taken and stopped after six weeks. I thought Cymbalta was bad but this medication was worse. I hear it really helps some people. I wasn’t one of them.
Fibromyalgia,fe6t9or,t1_fe63l6q,1578904392.0,"If your meds make you dizzy get off them, it’s dangerous. I was prescribed lyrica and then gabapentin and both made me stupid with blurred vision and dizziness. I almost had a wreck one day and never took another pill of this type medication. It just didn’t work for me."
ehlersdanlos,fe6syk7,t3_enzwtl,1578903946.0,"If someone tells you that you don’t look disabled just say “thank you” and go about your business. I have hEDS and have a placard for parking and use it when necessary without guilt. I dare someone to survive for a day in my body. EDS is one of the most painful medical conditions one may have and there is no cure, only symptom management. I have been in pain most of my adult life only to be ignored and dismissed by doctors until finally being diagnosed at age 56 by a geneticist. I practically had to cause a scene to finally get someone’s attention that my life wasn’t working for me, either get me help now or find someone who will. It sure took long enough for me to stand up for myself, don’t let this happen to you."
ChronicPain,fe6s1rx,t3_enly4o,1578902704.0,"There may be a reason the oxycodone isn’t effective for you. I took it for awhile with absolutely no relief so my doctor ordered a genetic test to determine which pain medications worked for me, and I had tried several that were useless. My body didn’t metabolize oxycodone at all. I have been on the same medication and same dosage for over five years now. I am prescribed an extended relief medication as well as an immediate release for breakthrough pain and this combination works. I have never even asked for an increase in dosage. You need to find out what works best for you. The other information others posted is absolutely correct, don’t self adjust your meds. You aren’t an addict, just probably not on the correct medication and perhaps under medicated. One pill does not fit all."
opiates,fe5p561,t1_fdx15dt,1578872465.0,"If Bernie had won the election this country would be on it’s way to rival Venezuela  as a country people are trying to get out of. Our economy would be in a downward spiral as would our society. Our southern border is overflowing because people are trying to escape Socialism, it doesn’t work. Maybe when you grow up and have actual responsibilities it will make sense to you. The government can’t be your mother and support you forever. At some point one cannot depend on the work of others for their livelihood."
opiates,fe5l009,t1_fe3xqc1,1578870788.0,"No, you won that honor and wouldn’t understand if I pointed it out to you."
disability,fe5iof8,t1_fe06z2y,1578869946.0,"In addition, M4A is not going to start the day after taking office. This isn’t the place to voice my political views but if you think your life will suddenly improve if Bernie is elected, you are sorely mistaken. Who is going to foot the bill? Socialism hasn’t worked very well for Venezuela has it?"
ChronicPain,fe5gnjg,t1_fe41e70,1578869184.0,"Exactly what point are you trying to make? It almost sounds like you are placing blame on President Trump for your illness and/or chronic condition and the resulting pain you have. I realize he is blamed for most anything Democrats don’t like, even if it happened before he was elected, but pain blame is a stretch. This really is getting ridiculous. I apologize if I assumed incorrectly but I never associated sociopaths and elections with my chronic pain, well maybe mental pain."
ChronicPain,fe5dyzr,t3_ensbxy,1578868223.0,"My independent pharmacy is closed on Saturday and Sunday and always filled my medication due over the weekend on the Friday before the weekend. I’ve never asked it was just always ready for pickup. Medications were always filled on the 28th day. If that 28th day fell on the weekend, it could be picked up on Friday. I’ve been taking pain medication a little over four years now and the first place I tried to fill it was CVS, and of course the first thing out of the pharmacist mouth was “we don’t have that medication in stock and I’m not sure when we will get it.” When the pharmacist moved away a technician kind of took me aside and gave me the name of an independent pharmacy telling me they don’t jerk people around like CVS. I’ve been using this pharmacy ever since. Chain pharmacies absolutely avoid filling pain medication if at all possible. I’ve found the pharmacists at these pharmacies to be arrogant and judgmental as well."
ChronicPain,fdpoq6z,t1_fdo8sk5,1578634890.0,Well said.

pharmacy,fdcuyk1,t3_eka16q,1578285051.0,"I take the Teva brand because they are effective and don’t make me sick. The Mallinkrodt brand makes me very sick. Any medication made by this manufacturer is horrible for me. I actually take this medication because I need it so I don’t worry about street recognition. You sound like a jerk, switching to the crap brand just to get rid of some of your customers. Someday you just might get a taste of your own medicine. Try not to choke."
ChronicPain,fd7dkti,t3_ek5rgn,1578202813.0,"I am so sorry for what you are going through. I have hEDS as well and it sucks the life out of you even under ideal circumstances. Your brother sounds like an ass. My brother is so supportive, probably feels guilty he missed the bullet and has a normal life."
ChronicPain,fd3hyhn,t3_ejy1aq,1578158452.0,"This happens when a patient presents to a doctor complaining of pain from an unknown source, at least that was my experience. Although I had pain most of my adult life, I was still able to work. In 2005 I finally had to quit and go on disability. The next fourteen years were pure hell, in addition to trying to find out what was wrong with me, doctors treated me as if I was a drug seeking, depressed person just trying to get attention. As if anyone would want that kind of attention. I was shot up with so many steroids that I have permanent damage to my spine. Never once did I ask for drugs, just help. In 2014 I was finally diagnosed with hEDS by geneticist and referred to a pain management doctor for medication management. I wouldn’t be able to function if not for the medication. Once you mention pain, doctors treat you like dirt for the most part. I’m sorry you had to go through all of this."

You were right to ask staff to talk to her parents because they probably would have ignored you. Not everyone in foreign countries speak English. The first time I read the post, I thought you meant the buffet was Chinese food. You got ambushed."
TalesFromTheCustomer,fd0ke1r,t3_ehv8c9,1578120074.0,"I am saving you a scroll. Everyone is discussing vending machines, their experience with VM in college, probability of VM falling over, weight of VM, and on and on. As far as the natural selection comment by agent at train station, I hope it got Grandma’s attention and she pays attention to where her grandkids are from now on, unfortunately she may not know what natural selection means. It was a great comment. Thanks for posting."
ChronicPain,fd0c3p0,t1_fd0afzr,1578116715.0,With a federal job guarantee I’m afraid the people on the business end of the hotline would be worse than the ones already there.
ChronicPain,fcw8mls,t3_ej29s5,1578019653.0,Why don’t you just suddenly have a muscle spasm when you are laying on the table. Make sure you have a weight strapped around your wrist and her face is within reach. Then ask if those supplements help with muscle spasms? Maybe they help with bruising so you’re face doesn’t look so bad. At least It’s fun thinking about doing it.
ChronicPain,fcw7pn6,t3_ej6bh2,1578019056.0,You just told my story. I know based on my diagnosis that my pain will never end and this is such a hard life to live. I live in fear that one day my pain medication will be restricted or taken away all together by government restrictions. Living in pain is an exercise in survival. I really did have dreams at one time but pain took them away.
ChronicPain,fcmgh1e,t3_ehqtla,1577774349.0,"Why not just give them a totally useless gift that they already have or one they are unable to physically use. If they don’t catch on, do it again the following year and the following year to infinity if necessary. Some people are going to do what they want to do regardless of how much you try to get their attention. I think some people buy what they know you don’t want or need just to show they are still in control. Your brother sounds like the poster child for this.

ehlersdanlos,fcmfnzy,t1_fcgncgb,1577773506.0,"What are you really so angry about? Nobody is trying to invalidate Ms. Fingers, just offering information that she might be interested in knowing. She should be thrilled that she only has bendy fingers, at least that was the only thing mentioned. Hypermobility is about ones joints, hEDS involves not only the joints but the entire body. And we are aware that some people have EDS Lite with fewer symptoms than others, this isn’t a pissing match. People are here to share information. As far as being “hurtful”, I could be hurt that some have easier symptoms making me feel invalid because mine suck. You jump on someone just because you don’t like what they’re saying."
ehlersdanlos,fcmdyjb,t1_fcgo11i,1577771816.0,"Actually the worse your symptoms are the more you are told it’s all in your head. OP only listed the bendy fingers and most are basing their response on that. It appears she might simply be hyperbole, not hEDS or CDT. If she presented at the doctor with her fingers positioned like in the photo she would probably be told to stop screwing with her fingers and she will be fine."
ehlersdanlos,fcmd0h5,t1_fcgt69f,1577770935.0,Excellent answer and well stated.
ehlersdanlos,fcmbksb,t1_fcgoxob,1577769659.0,"IMO if his girlfriend has EDS I think he would have noticed very early on in the relationship,especially since he has EDS. I have never heard of EDS localized to only the fingers. I wondered how long it took her to position her fingers to be cringe worthy for the photo. If her fingers normally are in this position, again he would have noticed early on and so would she. She will have arthritis if she continues the finger posing. The other poster only offered an opinion and a lot us here feel the same way,IMO. I didn’t notice any other symptoms other than funky fingers."
ehlersdanlos,fcm9xo2,t3_ehjx0w,1577768239.0,"I feel this way most mornings after a night of poor sleep. Doctors always dismissed these symptoms as needing more exercise, depression, or the usual “it’s in your head” reasons for feeling like crap all the time."
ehlersdanlos,fcjex5s,t3_ehgdmf,1577685146.0,"Old lady here to give a short response to your question, I’m to tired right now to provide a more adequate answer. I’m almost 60 and my quality of life sucks as I sit on my couch all day watching TV as I wait for my monthly disability check. I am my worst nightmare. I wish I could tell you it plateaus at a certain age but at least for me, it has been a downhill run. The pain and fatigue can suck the life out of you. Hopefully, better treatment is on the horizon for you. At least I have two new knees and I don’t fall on my face anymore like I did when a knee popped out."
disability,fc23f4s,t1_fby7d3r,1577338827.0,"So true, and the self proclaimed pain warriors are leading the charge. This is why we can overcome any obstacle. They can make some of us regular civilians look as if we are embellishing our medical problems. We just need to do more yoga and become vegan, I read it online so it must be true. Sorry for the mini rant."
