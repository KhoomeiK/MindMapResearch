aww,fdrskba,t1_fdroogb,1578689030.0,"Greetings, citizen. Welcome to /r/aww!

You will be:

1. Criticized for having an overweight pet.
2. Criticized for allowing a pet to breed, for any reason.
3. Criticized for having a dog with a short snout.
4. Criticized for not petting an animal that obviously wants to be petted.
5. Criticized for having a wild animal as a pet. /r/aww defines a wild animal as anything other than a dog, cat, or hamster.
6. Criticized for having a pet if it appears to be a pure bred, because it probably came from a breeder and obviously all breeders are pure unadulterated spawns of Satan."
