nihilism,fefx03c,t3_eoblcp,1579067978.0,"you can say that morality is subjective all you want but you’re gonna be mad as shit if someone cuts your arm off or murders your children. You shouldn’t fuck up other people’s lives because no matter how nihilistic you are, you don’t want other people fucking up yours. We’re all suffering together. Morality is subjective, but there’s no benefit for anyone to treat it like it is."

How would your husband know who does alllllll these other women he knows’ pelvic exams??? he doesn’t. Also, I’m sure your doctor, who’s JOB it is to do these types of exams regularly doesn’t get hell from his wife for it. Because you know, it’s just a medical exam that is a standard procedure and is in no way sexual in nature. What—? Is your husband 5?"

Your mother’s presence in the room for YOUR child’s birth is a privilege, not a right."
nihilism,feft8yp,t1_feds322,1579064503.0,There’s a lot more to do with your short existence than suicide and procreation. Just because your existence is meaningless doesn’t mean it has to be so god damn melancholy. Um HELLO. If nothing means anything than why would you have to stick to what you are biologically “meant” to do?
SuicideWatch,fed27cc,t3_eoc598,1578995028.0,I remember when I graduated high school and I was like wow. Damn. Didn’t plan on being around this long.
nihilism,fed22v4,t3_eo72gb,1578994841.0,"There’s comfort in structure. No matter what you believe, we’re all still suffering. I don’t think people having artificial comfort and living their lives and feeling like they are important is a bad thing unless they are interfering with other people’s freedom. And everything is relative. You might look back at your old organized way of thinking and see it as prison, but I’m sure you didn’t think that way when you believed it."
nihilism,fed17gv,t3_eogl67,1578993548.0,"You’re worrying waaaaay too much. The whole thing with nihilism is that nothing matters, so why waste your short and meaningless existence stressing yourself out? Just roll with it dawg. Ride the wave.
Edit: USE. FUCKING. PROTECTION. A baby is NEVER the answer to an existential crisis. A baby doesn’t solve problems, it creates a lot of unnecessary ones. If you’re already unhappy, having a baby will make you a million times MORE stressed out and unhappy."

you don’t understand the bond between some girls and their cats. It’s a beautiful thing. You forced your girlfriend into a position where she may have felt like she had to choose between her beloved cat and making you happy. She stuck to her ground and chose her cat like any responsible woman should do. Also, why do you care about her income and finances right now? She’s a big girl and will handle that on her own. How would you like it if someone you loved told you to stop spending money on something that was very important to you? She was probably offended that you not only insulted her ability to manage her money, but also undermined the importance of her beloved cat."

nihilism,fdmwwkz,t3_elh0g7,1578569518.0,bold of you to assume that any realization is important or that it matters if anyone is smarter or dumber than anyone else. EVERYONE is worthless and we are ALL going to die and our species will eventually go extinct and leave the universe with no reminders of its short ride :)

nihilism,fdmurzm,t3_elzfkq,1578566782.0,Knowing that everything means nothing really makes it difficult to deal with those that are happily devoted to the idea that they have a purpose. :)
