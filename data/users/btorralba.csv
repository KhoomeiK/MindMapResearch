So imagine just chilling in ur dorm, roomate on Netflix and you trynna sleep before a test. All of a sudden, 11pm ish, blaring fire alarm goes off. Of course I’m in a lofted bed, so I gotta jump down. I tell my roomate im naked he turns around and I throw on some shorts. Stroll out the door, nobody was the wiser.
