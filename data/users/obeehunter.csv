GroceryStores,ffbq2cj,t1_ffba60k,1579778026.0,"If it's anything like where I work, there is a public eating area next to a Starbucks and a kitchen which makes sandwiches on the spot. The staff eating room is all the way upstairs and is (to me anyway) always stuffy and too hot while the public eating area is open with huge windows that let you look outside. Also the our public eating area has these large, comfy leather chairs. Most of our employees will take off their uniform hats while eating lunch there but even when people don't, it is pretty obvious they're on a break. 

Personally, I have NEVER seen any customer approach an employee in this area while the employee is clearly on lunch nor have I ever heard complaints from any co-worker of this happening. I think maybe once, while a customer was passing by, they asked me if they were heading the right way towards the bathroom. 

But if I was approached by any customer that seriously expected me to fully help them while I was on break, I'd be pretty shocked honestly."
