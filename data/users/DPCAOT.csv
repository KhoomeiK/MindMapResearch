cats,ffpgt81,t3_eubzc0,1580094691.0,So sorry for your loss
datingoverforty,ffk386c,t3_etxca2,1580014432.0,You have a very angelic look
FemaleDatingStrategy,ffget2b,t1_ffg8jtu,1579904634.0,I totally know what you mean. I see myself probably going down that same path. Guarding ones emotional and mental health is more important than sex
FemaleDatingStrategy,ffg3aks,t1_ffg2sbk,1579897533.0,Darn it. Right now I’m fine with being celibate. But I’ve had some phenomenal sex in the past and I would like to experience that again but like you said you start losing control of your emotions. I can see how your system would definitely work if sex isn’t involved
FemaleDatingStrategy,ffd61bh,t1_ffczm70,1579814110.0,How do you find the small dose men? How do you not get attached and where do you find them? I also only want them in small doses for sex and company but then I also don’t want to feel used. Basically I haven’t figured this out yet
FemaleDatingStrategy,ff9lrdi,t3_esc18u,1579715664.0,I did give a short man a chance. It was one of the most emotionally damaging dating experiences I’ve had. He was inherently very angry.
physicaltherapy,ff73jrd,t3_erzzuz,1579640410.0,Wow they skipped through reimbursement changes? Smdh
OccupationalTherapy,ff4t2ja,t3_er0aqj,1579571774.0,Is there a reason why you switched out of pa? Right now therapists are looking into switching to pa because of recent Medicare changes that have affected jon need/availability
poledancing,ff4pv6a,t1_fddcygv,1579569566.0,I love you thank you
OccupationalTherapy,ff4k82p,t3_era4qt,1579565619.0,"Mmm I disagree that it’s good on your body. It’s hard in pediatrics especially outpatient because you’re constantly moving around large pieces of sensory equipment and putting up heavy swings and then you’re dealing with some kids who are heavy (the ot’s I did my level 2 with were considering switching to hand therapy after a few years there), it’s hard if you do clinic in school based, it’s hard in snf (transfers), and hard in acute rehab. It’s hard in outpatient in the sense that you’re doing a lot of repetitive manual work with the smaller muscles in your hand. Even with good body mechanics it’s hard because your body isn’t really meant to perform functional transfers day in and day out on acute heavy stroke patients or heavier status post hip replacement patients who have a lot of pain who barely want to move. People say oh just work in mental health! Let’s be real..how many ot mental health jobs are open in your area? Probably not many..."
OccupationalTherapy,ff435q1,t1_ff432fx,1579554524.0,Yes! Agreed. In acute care you probably won’t be doing one handed sewing or something like that either.
dating,ff1olcl,t3_eqsoc3,1579482721.0,"This is exactly why I deleted all my apps. They will share their hopes dreams goals every thought and the day before our actual date something trivial will happen like not receiving a text from me on their time, so they’ll delete me cuz I’m showing “too many red flags”. Better to meet people in real life"
OccupationalTherapy,ff1odt2,t3_eqxrve,1579482593.0,You might be better suited for outpatient
antidepressants,feknea8,t3_epl89p,1579203664.0,No
physicaltherapy,feiwrbx,t3_ep4122,1579149331.0,Just wanted to chime in and say I know exactly what you mean. I literally fantasize about being a librarian
antidepressants,febkgu7,t1_feaevct,1578959729.0,I’m gonna message you
antidepressants,febja59,t3_eo9nax,1578959383.0,"I took wellbutrin and Prozac together. No real side effects except longer to have an orgasm and my dreams became vivid and movie like, but it made my lows less low and got me out of a spiraling depression. Was on them for a year and got off a month ago with no side effects.

Edit: I might actually be having withdrawals so I retract my last statement"
IAmA,febib6c,t3_eo9age,1578959132.0,How many people are cheating and bringing in their mistress?
