>Me: Though I fear this conversation may be lost at this point, I have some final followup questions.

>Are you aware of how much Low Density Parity Check codes improve the link budget and throughput? It's about double.

>Do you know how the difference in altitude affects the system? For starters, the region each satellite covers is much smaller. The radius of coverage scales linearly with altitude. Users are some number ( call it X ) per square meter. Square meters scales proportional to the radius squared. So 22.2 thousand / 500 = 44.4. Square that and you get 1971.36. Each EchoStar has 1971.36x the number of users.

>So if all other things were the same then a typical Starlink customer should get about 3800x thoughput. Just saying. However, there are a lot of variables to play with. Bandwidth, modulation scheme, digital encoding, etc.

>Do you understand the Shannon Limit? There's no real way to do a comparison without all the relevant information. If you double the bandwidth you can double the data throughput. Different encoding schemes can dramatically affect the throughput. NASA uses really strong digital encoding to transmit data from the Mars rover to the Earth. It's a really slow link, but it goes really damn far and it's probably less power than a cell tower transmits at. 

>Oh, that brings up power too. Since the satellites are 1/44.4 the distance to the user, you can trade the extra power for extra speed. If you remember way back when there weren't cell towers everywhere, your transmission speed could go up when you were close to a tower and down when you were far from a tower. The power difference at the receiver for both systems is quite huge. About 32.8 dB. That's probably another 8x faster transmission speed, but I'd have to see a complete link budget to be sure.

>FUDder: yes it is Shannon’s law that is the limiting factor here. It’s why telephone lines were limited in BW and same for F/O. Can’t overcome the physics. BER’s aren’t the only limitations.

Did they do their due diligence in researching and getting the right prices for all services?

Let's look at one line item. why does it cost $8,500 for office telephone service? After a quick search for business VoIP services (I work in the IT industry so I'm relatively familiar with VoIP services), I found Ooma Office.

$19.95/user/month. I've only visited the office a handful of times but on the high end, there isn't more than 10 people in the building. It's a small office.

even then, $19.95 * 10users * 12months = $2,394/year. 

Okay, well they're probably including internet service with that cost. Alright.

Let's do a highball. Optimum Business Voice and Internet (my area's ISP).

Monthly cost

Internet plan ($84.95) + low-end 200Mbps speed ($144.95) + 10 voice lines at $29.95/seat*10 seats ($299.95)

84.95+144.95+299.95=529.85*12 months = $6358.20/year.

That's STILL $2k cheaper than what they're paying.

---------------

$12,000/year for pool expenses. Can they do better? What does this cost come from? 

----------------------

I'm confused about Utilities. I know they pay the water bill but whhy does it list Electric and Heating? Each unit pays their own Electric and heating directly to the utility provider.

For Electric, perhaps it's including the cost to run the exterior streetlights?

as for $10k in heating oil, the only thing I can think is perhaps the cost to heat the office building? But it's a relatively small structure. No larger than 3-4 of our housing units, and it costs at most $1k/year to heat my unit. Pay $100-130 on the highest usage winter months and as low as $48 during the summer.

Can't see how that would add up to $10k in usage.

-------------------------------

$95.9k for maintenance repair and supplies. Fair, but I'd like to see that more itemized.

$91.6k for Landscaping? The crew didn't even do that great. We had to ask to get our bushes trimmed last summer. they weren't touched until early September. I'd like to see if they compared other companies. Who knows if this company is just a friend of a friend who needed extra business."

fuckHOA,ff9865i,t1_ff93f6j,1579707076.0,"okay, let me rephrase this.

***I personally don't care what they throw out or if they work on their cars in the lots***.

What I DO care about is selective enforcement of some rules and not others. Some times of the year and not others. For certain people and not others (bridge club friends, I'm sure).

These all come off as a symptom of an HOA that is hands-off and not engaged with the community. Keeping rules on the books that were set decades ago and never changed or reviewed because the same 7 people have been on the board since the 70's when the place was built and they were 30-40 years old.

I'd just as easily get rid of these rules entirely. I don't want to tell people how to live their lives and would be just as happy to let everyone have the freedom to use their home as they wish. 

The only issue comes when the sole useful reason for HOA rules comes into play. They (ideally) want the community to look nice and pretty, so home values are stable/improve and hopefully attract more homebuyers.

This is the only reason where I'd sort of agree with not having people paint their units whatever color they want, change the color of their doors/windows or repaint/replace their fences.

It can start to look a bit chaotic in a community where the units are of a uniform design.

Beyond that, Idgaf. I want to be able to BBQ on my patio (can only use electric). I'd like to be able to work on my car in the lot. I'd also like to be able to charge my car at home.

It doesn't have to do with what I want people to do. These are rules that the HOA has already defined. My problem is with the selective enforcement of their rules. They only seem to want to take charge when someone says something. They can let a, b and c slide because they don't want to deal with people but can be strict about x, y and z if it serves their interest and they know the person won't complain.

>Why would they vote to take away their own privileges? 

Again, the rules are already set in place by the HOA but are not being enforced. The selective enforcement of their own rules shows dishonesty and lack of integrity.

A 4door hatchback by your definition would also include cars like a Hyundai ioniq or Chevy Volt. It doesn't have a separated trunk and has opening into the rear seats just like a hatch does. but these are larger vehicles that a hatchback and I'd consider closer to a compact sedan.

>Every year you should be getting the financial disclosures from the HOA showing exactly how much income they have, how much the operating expenses are, how much is saved for the reserves, and what the reserve expenses for that year are. 

only available during office hours, which coincidentally are during work hours for everyone else. I politely asked if they could be emailed.

>If you want to change the meeting times you need to get more people to run for the board, and more people to vote. You could also allow people to call into the meetings, to make it easier to participate for landlords, and get some of them to run.

That would be a great idea. I'll make this one of my campaign items. Many people here seem to be hands-off and don't really talk to each other. I think simply creating an easier and more open channel of communication between residents and the board is super important.

>in getting electric chargers installed?

I left flyers on 80 unit doors with a link/email/phone# for a survey to gauge interest. Only two responded so far. I'm the only one currently with a plug-in car."

that's the plan. Going to start talking to more people once it gets warmer. Get to know them prior to November elections. See if they have changes that they'd like to see implemented."
fuckHOA,ff79abz,t3_ekv618,1579643721.0,"I'm considering doing something like this myself.

Our board president did make a Facebook group and mentioned it on the last two newsletters but only 8 people signed up so far and it doesn't appear that anyone is moderating it or adding any content.

fuckHOA,ff714tr,t1_ff6y8y1,1579639043.0,">This should be getting voted on by the community after looking at maintenance bids, etc

The problem is I have a feeling most people just toss and outright ignore the newsletters. Very hands-off community.

Any changes that would be voted on can just be voted on by the small minority of board voters. The board can essentially control the votes.

And even if residents do vote, all they have to go by is the HOA saying ""we need to fix up the roads and roofs. give us more money"".

I don't see how the prices of these repairs can change every year. 

To comment on elections, In the most recent newsletter I read this. 

>""As was announced at the Homeowners’ meeting on November 7th, no candidates other than <85yo British woman>(already a Board Member) ran for a position on the Board at the proposed Election last year. 

>On discussion and advice of our Attorney, no Election was held and at the December Board Meeting, <prior mentioned 85yo> was re-appointed to the Board for a further term of three years. On January 6, at the first Board Meeting of the New Year, the Board voted to install the Officers for this year. Your Officers remain as follows: <list of names. Mix of Dorothy's, Loretta's, Pamela's and Maugerite's.>

This gives me the impression that no one is voting for these elections and they can just keep re-electing themselves."
