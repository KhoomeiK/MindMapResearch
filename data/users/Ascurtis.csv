I guess I had combined a bunch of like pseudoscience mystical shit into an idea for a scifi propulsion system. The engine is a perfect black cube but when turned on it melts and begins to oscillate like a goopy flower. There were pages of it, pictures, I was so fucking confused.

I'd imagine they have some that are entirely covered in displays.  The way I picture it is the screens are hexagonal cels and cover the outside of the vehicle, and at the vertices there would be small cameras. Each hexagonal cel would have a corresponding camera on the opposite side of the craft. 

With phones soon able to have cameras embedded under the screen, each cel could have a camera inside them directly in the center so the vertices dont have gaps to accommodate a camera."

aliens,fefeqir,t1_feev67e,1579054759.0,"That's so weird.. so, about a year ago I was taking ambien to get off nights, and one morning I woke up with a bunch of pages from a notepad on the floor around my bed. I guess I had combined a bunch of like pseudoscience mystical shit into an idea for a scifi propulsion system. The engine is a perfect black cube but when turned on it melts and begins to oscillate like a goopy flower. There were pages of it, pictures, I was so fucking confused. It wasnt the first time I sleepwalked so I wasnt under the impression I was given the ideas or anything, just amused by the content. Anyways this just reminded me of it."

aliens,fef0kkr,t3_eom7ok,1579045354.0,"They have a way of cloaking where the bottom of the craft is a bunch of, well, displays, and have cameras mounted on top that capture the image of the sky above the plane and display it on the bottom so it looks as if you're looking through the craft. I'd imagine they have some that are entirely covered in displays.  The way I picture it is the screens are hexagonal cels and cover the outside of the vehicle, and at the vertices there would be small cameras. Each hexagonal cel would have a corresponding camera on the opposite side of the craft. 

With phones soon able to have cameras embedded under the screen, each cel could have a camera inside them directly in the center so the vertices dont have gaps to accommodate a camera."

Or a genetic thing where pronounced ridges are a dominant trait but some klingons express the Gene's for less ridges. Or there could be caste systems where at birth klingons with ridges would have thicker skull plates so get trained as warriors. Like how (inca? Mayan?) Shamans were chosen at birth.

The way I'd do it: start with the middle  layer, let it dry, spray a matte transparent layer with a spray can, then cover it with a layer of shading spray paint. Add another matte layer. Maybe do it again on this layer because it's the darkest.

Rinse and repeat. They could have used brushes to paint the transparent mediums but you run the risk of smudging the actual brushstrokes or lettering that needs to stay crisp and clean."
