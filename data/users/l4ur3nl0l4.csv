unpopularopinion,fgt69vy,t1_fgt5q57,1581099929.0,"If it was ingrained in me that gay people are sinners who go to hell, I’d do everything in my power to try to be straight. Many of the people who get married in heterosexual relationships that are gay aren’t just hiding the fact that they’re gay, they don’t even accept it or acknowledge it about themselves. They’ve convinced themselves they’ve been fixed and they’re straight, and it’s only many years later that they face the truth. Don’t make it seem like this is a thing that has zero consequences for them, fear of being killed is no small thing, but neither is a fear of everyone you know including your own family hating you and you literally going to hell for all eternity."

Many of these parents who see their children as gifts will do everything to keep their children alive as long as possible, but that often means that they are prolonging the suffering of their child (in the cases OP is referring to). So what if you think your child was meant to be on this earth, you’re making them suffer.  I don’t necessarily think these children should be called genetic glitches, but I also don’t think they were put on this earth to suffer, and realistically they have no purpose in life otherwise, so if there is a God, for lack of a better term they are functionally “genetic glitches” (again, I am not super comfortable with this phrasing either, but what other way is there to put it if they hold no higher purpose in life, and what reason would a god have to put children here with no purpose?)."

She will be teased relentlessly because yes, kids in her school will find out what her middle name is at some point one way or another.

AmItheAsshole,fess9vd,t1_fepzuf0,1579368497.0,"I agree that she’s an asshole for not wearing a mask. But she probably had a regular old cold. Cause it’s common. If she had something worse and didn’t *know* it, oh well, but if she did know it of course she’s a major asshole. But your original recommendation wasn’t just to wear a mask (which seems to be the only thing you focus on in your second statement because you want to make it seem like you didn’t mention it in your first), it was for her to MISS her flight. That’s just not reasonable. You can’t reasonably tell someone that they should miss a flight that would cost them thousands of dollars because they in all likelihood have a cold (and you aren’t a doctor who has seen her in person either, so don’t try to make things up for your scenario either. OP said cold, go with cold). People take risks when they fly. I’ve not once complained about sitting next to a crying baby, an overweight person, or getting sick after flying. Why? Cause I knew it could happen. Sure, it sucks, but I don’t expect everyone to accommodate me when they spent a lot of money too. Also, no one wants to fly while sick. Trust me, if it where an option she’d happily move her flight to when she weren’t sick. But it wasn’t an option. She had to just suffer through an already unpleasant experience while also being sick.  OP’s an asshole because they were on the plane and there’s nothing to do about it at that point, so instead of being quiet about it he just makes a bunch of passive aggressive comments that she can hear. I think anytime you make comments about another person that they can hear and can’t go anywhere to be away from it, you’re an asshole (and OP didn’t even stop after she confronted them). OP’s not an asshole for being upset, but just cause you’re upset doesn’t give you the right to be extremely rude.

But, maybe as a way of supporting her, you could pull your hair up into a hat? Unless the problem is that you want your hair down, it may be a way to compromise and show you support her without doing something that’s more “permanent” (I’m aware it’s technically temporary, but growing hair takes years so it’s not a short term thing)."

unpopularopinion,fead9o5,t1_fe8mm89,1578947207.0,Where I live there isn’t any theatre I can think of that bans babies. This isn’t an option for a lot of people.
unpopularopinion,feabvfa,t1_fe9lge4,1578946775.0,"Nothing, but if you don’t ban all babies parents who have super loud babies who still want to see a movie will just argue about how their baby won’t make a sound, and then will probably refuse to leave when their baby starts crying."

unpopularopinion,fdzvfnn,t1_fdzgllq,1578796733.0,"Telling someone they’re wrong about what they believe isn’t going to change their mind, it’ll just antagonize them and make them angry, so what’s the point? Just leave them alone to their beliefs (provided they’re minding their own business, if they’re saying something hurtful in the name of religion call out the belief, not the religion)"
unpopularopinion,fdzuszy,t1_fdz7451,1578796303.0,"Rape has no good qualities. Religion has plenty (I can think of many examples of people who do good things in the name of their religion if you need help). If someone is a good person who is religious you are just plain rude if you argue that their religion sucks and are wrong the same way if an atheist is a good person you are just plain rude if you argue they are wrong. Obviously if someone is saying something hurtful in the name of either religion or atheism you should tell them that particular belief sucks and is wrong, not that the whole religion or lack of religion is to blame and how you are the right one."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fdt8fly,t1_fdt7o68,1578713283.0,"I don’t think that’s an acceptable thing for anyone to do to any other person no matter what, but if you don’t want to protect people anymore, DONT. You shouldn’t get payed to protect people if you aren’t going to actually protect them because you think they don’t deserve it. People don’t have hive minds, we don’t all think alike. Many people think cops are great, and some are terrible people like the ones you described. That doesn’t mean no one should be protected. And if you feel that way, quit (not just you, but all cops who feel this). And there’s a huge difference between not wanting to protect people and straight up harassing them like these cops did. The woman did nothing and was tripped by one cop while being pushed by another cop."

So if it’s true I’d like to be protected and not harassed just for walking down the street like this woman. I don’t like this answer, but if the options are pay for protection or hope I never need a cop for help I’d rather pay. The other option is cops actually do their job and protect people like they’re supposed to no matter the circumstances or how hated by the people they feel"
