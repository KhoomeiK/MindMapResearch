NoMansSkyTheGame,ffii3rh,t1_ffi5waq,1579974400.0,"Generational differences in gaming perception are fascinating.  I grew up with video games in the golden era (80s kid, NES was first console) and I've noticed throughout my life that older people often don't really understand them.  Some curious older people ask questions and come to understand it better, but amazingly many have been living through the past 40 years of an increasingly video game saturated society without having any clue what they're about.  To me that's like not knowing about TV or film.  It's similar with board games too but that's more understandable as they've only recently become more mainstream.  But it's amazing how many people there are out there that still only know about cards and classic games like chess or monopoly.  

I remember once when I was in grade 6 which would have been 1993-94 I wrote about video games for a writing assignment.  I can't remember about what exactly but I recall the teacher commenting on it thoughtfully and stating thinks like ""it appears that there is much more to this than eye-hand coordination of 2-dimensional objects on screen"".  I think his conception of video games stopped at Asteroids level of gameplay, and he just had no idea that by 1993 it was a vastly different landscape that made the older generation of games look like cheap babies toys that a monkey could play."
science,ffifykt,t3_etoayc,1579972947.0,"Seems pretty intuitive, no?  I think we've just gotten quite used to it and don't think much of it, but imagine if back before social media someone at school or work mailed everyone a selfie or posted it up on the walls.  We would think that was weird and narcissistic as fuck.  I wonder what goes through people's heads when they're taking a picture of themselves to post online.  Why do they think anybody wants to see that?  What purpose does it serve them?"
AskReddit,ffgetx5,t1_ffgcqr2,1579904649.0,"I'm not saying the banks wanted the crisis, I'm saying that anyone who profited from it wanted it.  Those people are not worse off, they're clearly better off.  

Money and all other traded resources are finite and the market is thus a zero sum game.  You can't get richer without other people getting poorer, period.  Wealthy finance industry people that exploit the market are well aware of this and don't care.  Their entire business is to shift money by any means from other people's pockets to theirs without actually providing any service or goods of any kind."
Hamilton,ffg2cuz,t3_etetye,1579896954.0,I once saw a crime stoppers ad in the newspaper when I lived in Vernon BC about a car window broken to steal a can of coke.  Fucking insane.
AskReddit,fffyc1y,t1_fffmyce,1579894474.0,"But doesn't some people getting richer have the direct consequence of others getting poorer?  How is that not the fault of the wealthy manipulating things for profit?  You seriously think they don't know what they're doing but somehow manage to not only ride out waves but also keep getting richer?  I just don't buy this notion that by complete accident and to the complete surprise of everyone involved, wealth keeps polarizing with the same consistent pattern.  Even if it somehow wasn't ever intentional, it must be clear to the 0.1% that the system is rigged in their favour by design at this point, which they fight to maintain instead of fixing."

nottheonion,fffdx8p,t1_ffeutn2,1579881832.0,"I think we should just respond by calling their bluff and testing the limits.  Let's do a 3 day a week, 4 hours a day work week with full benefits and pension and all the other bells and whistles and see if the economy crashes.  If it does we will slowly increase until we hit stability.  

I'd guess realistically that about 20 hours of work a week is the most needed to sustain the economy.  Anything more is just the owning class bamboozling us."
nottheonion,fffdjg0,t1_ffena6g,1579881590.0,Sounds like maybe you are left leaning and might not realize it.  A main tennant of the left is just to regulate the economy so that people can't exploit us like this.  It's not all dictatorships and old school communism.  Most of us would be happy if we just stopped the billionaire madness and actually made decisions good for everyone.  That's what being left wing is for me.
Hamilton,fffcubt,t1_fffbkju,1579881150.0,"Yeah I wasn't so much concluding that gun crime follows directly from that, just that people who don't have work skills and are used to making money selling pot might struggle to adjust and this might lead to an increase in other crimes, most likely theft.  

And I don't think we should dismiss the anecdotes from children that easily.  They likely got it from somewhere.  Maybe they have parents involved in gang activity and have heard conversations about the way cannabis legalization is affecting their activities.  Maybe their parents have just complained about it, and have less money now.  Maybe the kids are involved in gangs and have been told by their leaders that this is what is happening.  They're just anecdotes and difficult to conclude anything from, but they paint a picture nonetheless."
Hamilton,fffbs04,t1_fff9swk,1579880482.0,"It's not about feeling bad for anyone, it's about understanding reality.  We know for an absolute fact that someone experiencing psychosis doesn't know what they're doing, so obviously they can't be held responsible in the same way.  If you woke up one day and everybody looked like dinosaurs trying to eat you, you might end up hurting soneone by mistake.  Not sure how that's hard for people to understand.  It's not an excuse, it's the reality of the situation.  It's the same as complete accidents in which someone gets hurt.  We don't blame the machine operator when a malfunction completely out of their control results in an injury or death.  It's literally the same thing with mental illness, the person is not functioning properly.  Their brain isn't working and they don't have control of what they're doing.  If you think otherwise you're just wrong.  It's 100% established proven fact.  

Now obviously it's pretty difficult not to react emotionally when a loved one is killed, and it's understandable that you might want to kill that person, but it doesn't change the facts.  Think of it this way: what if you hallucinated and believed that someone killed your kid?  Then you killed that person and found out later that you were mentally ill and nobody killed your kid and now you killed someone.  I don't think we have a great solution for these situations right now, but it's just a fact that you only did it because you believed the person murdered your kid.  Should you really be held fully responsible for that?"

AskReddit,fff7z3t,t1_ffee205,1579877986.0,"I'm actually not a communist at all.  I'm a far left democratic socialist, which is quite different.  Also, you haven't provided any real world examples or evidence any more than I have.  You just believe that the everyone is fundamentally greedy and prefer to chalk up economic problems to what happens when you put a bunch of greedy people together in a volatile economic system.  I think that's incredibly naive.  I think there is plenty of reason to believe that the system is the way it is by design because it largely benefits one group of people on a consistent basis, and we know that group of people have ties to all of the levers of control.  Why do you think it's always the same people benefiting from market crashes and always the same people losing?  It's not a coincidence.  You sound like one of those people who thinks that poker is just random gambling, even though it's always the same people at the final championship tables.  Wealthy people aren't riding on luck, that's much too unpredictable.  They're carefully controlling things.  

Even if it is more as you believe, it's still just pure exploitation of the majority by the wealthy because the wealthy understand what's going on in the very least, while the majority that lose out during crashes doesn't know what is going on.  Even if they don't control it entirely, they're still heavily exploiting a known problem and doing nothing to fix it, while screwing everyone else.  That's intentional."
Hamilton,fff6hs0,t1_ffevw1s,1579876947.0,"There were literally tens of thousands, if not a hundred thousand people in the country who sustained themselves on the sale of cannabis in some way.  You're the dumb one.  Those other drugs make more money, yes, but they're also way higher risk, consumed in much lower quantities, and less dependable.  The amount of people sustaining themselves in the cannabis trade was probably hundreds of times higher than any other drug.  It probably still is even with legalization.  If you think it isn't a big industry, you're fucking clueless.  It's one of the biggest industries in the world.  It's a 100 billion dollar business.

I myself have known dozens of people who sustained themselves selling cannabis, and they weren't selling pounds every day.  You could make 50k a year tax free easy with 30 customers in a pretty low level cannabis business."
Hamilton,fff62zi,t1_ffejgzr,1579876646.0,"I mean, anecdotes aside what he's saying is just intuitively obvious.  The long term benefit will be less drug crime action, but it will take a while for the dust to settle and there are most definitely people effectively out of a job as a result of legalization who are struggling to transition."
Hamilton,fff5pld,t1_fff4681,1579876374.0,And then professionals will determine the accuracy of those claims and he will be prosecuted accordingly.  That's what's supposed to happen in court.

Hamilton,fff5gj7,t1_fff03uw,1579876187.0,"He's clearly referring to the fact that people get shot a thousand times more often in the US than anywhere in the world.

AskReddit,ffed1du,t1_ffeco6p,1579843589.0,"I guess we'll have to agree to disagree then.  I don't agree with your interpretation that the greed permeated  every level of society.  A small sector, the ones that actually profited, intentionally exploited the majority by fooling them.  The majority weren't greedy, they just wanted their piece in a thoroughly capitalist society that they have little control over.  Unfortunately we aren't any better off in the long run, it's just another part of the con.  History will repeat until we fundamentally overhaul the system."

While I don't know your educational background I'm willing to bet I'm more well versed in these things than you are.  I haven't said anything to intentionally trash or insult you.  Yet you've done just that to me and have the gall to accuse me of being pompaus.  Most intellectuals on the subject disagree with you.  You'd know that if you were educated on these things.

AskReddit,ffebh7n,t1_ffeafqz,1579842141.0,"Certain people put it into motion in order to make profit knowing it would very likely be the end result.  Not sure how you're interpreting that so differently, but I guess we're really arguing about motives, which is difficulty to prove.  The simplest way to think of it in my opinion is to consider that wealthy people aiming to exploit the market for profit know that doing so will result in the majority of people losing money and the market not being able to sustain the crash of the bubble they create in order to stimulate market action.  It happens by design.  It's not that shadowy supervillain figures are doing it for the hell of it.  It's a system of various wealthy players all playing a game they know makes them rich and others poor by exploiting flawed markets.  I'd say that's pretty rigged and orchestrated."
AskReddit,ffeaqbj,t1_ffe7nvs,1579841476.0,"Nope, I'm just highly politically educated and informed and I know how to think properly.  You seem to suffer from the same problem a lot of people do, which is difficulty abstracting from complicated real world scenarios and analysing theories and systems for what they are.  Pointing to bad things that happened and claiming ""communism did it"" because they happened to occur under a highly imperfect communist system for reasons unrelated to the fundamentals of communism is just terrible reasoning.  There are plenty of excellent analyses of capitalism, on the other hand, that demonstrate fundamental flaws even in ideal scenarios.  In fact, capitslism is designed to work only for the elite class, and thus under ideal conditions it will collapse. 

A highly regulated and non-hierarchical democratic socialist system with some level of private market could probably work quite nicely.  Still less efficient than communism, but more desirable to people who feel like exercising a greater degree of economic freedom is important.  This is the system I'd bet on, but it's difficult to know what sorts of ways it could be exploited in the real world."

AskReddit,ffe7hoe,t1_ffe56m3,1579838773.0,"There is so much wrong with what you've just said, it's astonishing.  First of all, I just stated that the USSR was not a good example because it ended up corrupted and it was heavily undermined.  You seem to have missed that.  It also wasn't properly democratic.  

Second, I promise you that 10 times as many countries would celebrate the fall of the American Empire, which has had an absolutely abysmally negative affect on billions of people. The USSR didn't have a stranglehold and military base in almost every country in the world.  

Third, communism is actually vastly more efficient than capitalism, by definition.  That's the primary benefit of communism.  Zero dollars are wasted on pointless capitalist competition and vanity.  Most corporations spend most of their money and human power on things other than actually producing anything, like marketing.  Most public money is spent on fixing stuff that capitalism fucked up.  Those are just a couple of hundreds of ways capitslism hemorrhages resources.  No money is wasted under communism, it's all spent purposefully and nobody is hoarding and starving the population for resources either.  

Capitalism is massively self-defeating.  It's just pretty good at insulating itself from complete collapse by using excessive military force, police control, distracting entertainment, media control, and carefully measured bone throwing, among other things."
AskReddit,ffe57c2,t1_ffdv7se,1579837004.0,"And they just keep doing the same thing over and over and nobody seems to see the pattern for what it is.  The Middle East is way worse off after the war on Afghanistan and Iraq.  That's recent, we can see it.  But so many Americans still believe the myth that somehow those countries benefitted from 20 years of war and the never ending presence of an imperialist power.  They got jacked hard.  This has been the status quo for the US for a century."
AskReddit,ffe4kg9,t1_ffdurqw,1579836529.0,"I'd say it was quite intentional.  The Americans already knew the power of capitalism and how to manipulate it (well the rich ones calling the shots anyway).  They practically invented it, at least the most potently capitalism form bred in the US.  The very reason they opposed communism in the first place was that it was a thorn in their side for imperialist domination and they also just didn't like the fact that a powerful nation was demonstrating that a more socialist system could work well, at least in some ways.  It went against their whole philosophy.  Some people argue that in theory, communism could work well and that the downfall was really just that it was still corruptable (no moreso than capitalism) and that it was so heavily opposed by powerful capitalist interests.  I think there is a lot of truth to that.  We really haven't seen a good communist style system that is also heavily democratic with proper checks and balances to protect against corruption, and no constant undermining by capitalist empires.  

Anyway, long story short, powerful American interests knew very well that they would come out on top if they forced capitalism because they already controlled that game.  It's just like how capitalists on Wall Street manipulate market events and then take advantage of them, like when depressions are orchestrated.  If you're already rich, as you say, upheaval and market depression is typically good for you because you're insulated and you can capitalize on how cheap everything is for a while, and also on how desperate people become.  This is what the US did to the USSR."

In 10 years you'll have way more than earned back what you lost.  $210k salary plus $100k school costs over 3 years = $310k lost.  7 years of $90k extra per year = $630k extra pay.  That's $320k more money in 10 years total time from now.  Even if you only make an additional $35k per year, you'll still come out even by 10 years from now.  That's a great turnaround.  Then of course you'll work another 10-20 years at that higher rate and make way more money.  But it's good to look at how long it will take to pay off, which is very conservatively 10 years total."

Music,ff70xfm,t1_ff6tbaz,1579638922.0,"There is literally zero real life evidence for your claim, even the amended one you're now making.  There is a mountain of evidence to the contrary.  Working hard is neither a sufficient nor necessary condition for financial success.  This is incredibly easy to ascertain by simply looking at real life labour scenarios.  There are undoubtedly people who have worked hard and not succeeded.  There are also undoubtedly people who have succeeded without working hard.  Again, there are countless examples of this.  It directly follows from these premises that your conclusion is false.  

I have met or listened to interviews of successful musicians and while they might claim to have worked hard in some sense, any honest ones will admit that their life has been considerably easier than an average person's life and they have put in far less hours as a musician for far more money than most other people.

Music,ff6znsl,t1_ff6ew9l,1579638183.0,"You're not getting it.  The analogy isn't meant to suggest that Bezos caused the fires.  It's to demonstrate that the overall context of the situation matters, and you can't just look at only the fact that money was donated.  This seems to be something you have difficulty comprehending.  I'm not sure how to better explain this to you but I'll try.

Imagine you are collecting sand to build a sand castle.  You need 500 buckets worth.  You go around asking and various average people give you a bit here and there, whatever they can spare, but it's slow going.  You then come to someone who has a virtually infinite amount of sand and could just give you 500 buckets worth without their pile diminishing almost at all, certainly not in any tangible/meaningful way.  But instead they give you a quarter of a bucket and tell you that you should be happy to get that.  Let's add the fact that this person only has so much sand because they ruthlessly monopolized the sand trade on your island, making it incredibly difficult for anyone else to obtain much sand.  

Are you seriously telling me you'd be happy with this and praise this sand baron?  You can see his nearly infinite pile of sand right there.  He even tells you straight up he doesn't need it at all but he's only going to give you a quarter bucket anyway, and that you should be grateful because he doesn't have to give you squat.

Most people would be very annoyed and bothered by this.  Now consider that this example is over something trivial and morally unimportant.  I've already mentioned these other examples on this thread, but if you missed them:

Consider Bezos comes across 10 drowning babies.  He can easily save them with no risk to himself.  It will cost him a little effort and ruin his nice suit.  Nobody else is around.  If he sits there watching them drown we'd likely think he was not only an asshole, but a terrible human being.  There is no way we'd just say ""well I guess he's not obligated"".  What if he saved 1 and watched the other 9 drown.  Would we praise him and say ""well he didn't have to do anything, so I guess we're grateful he saved one""?  No, we would be appalled that he didn't save the rest or at least try.  

Next example: consider a kingdom where the king is wealthy beyond imagination and the people who serve him are poor.  A disease strikes and there is a cure, but the people cannot afford it.  The king can easily afford to save them all without any meaningful decrease in his great wealth, but instead he decides to save only 5%.  You get to live but your whole family dies.  Then some ass-hat on medieval Reddit drops the comment that you shouldn't complain and instead should praise the king as he didn't have to save anyone, suggesting that instead you simply focus on the good the king did.  He cured more people than you right?  Now go back to your gruel and toiling in the fields so that your king can continue to get richer and not use the money.  Forget about your family.  

These examples are logically valid and sound.  Logically they match the scenario we are discussing perfectly.  I know they do because I'm trained professionally in the philosophy of logic and argumentation.  They're also put very simply for you.  If you still don't get it you're just incapable of understanding and should possibly study some logic to see if it helps."

Instead he pays to cure 10% of the people, and you're not one of them.  Would you be praising this king, saying ""well at least he gave something""?  If so, wow you're really oppressed."

I've been renting since I was 19.  The catch 22 is that since we have less money and less secure jobs these days, it's helpful to live with family, but those same financial circumstances also tend to delay finding a solid career, marriage, and kids for most people.  I'd likely still be at my parent's house by now if I didn't move away a long time ago as I just settled into a solid career less than 5 years ago and am still not married with kids.  I think it actually made more sense to stay living at home when it was likely you'd be ready to settle into your own house and family by your mid twenties.

I was in my 20s and traveled after uni just for something to do, and after traveling around throughout the summer and fall I decided to stay in the area a while and work at the mountain so I could just snowboard and party.  The supervisor was about my age and an okay guy, but most of the other staff were local teens.  I didn't expect too much out of them and we all had a good time there as it's mostly a fun job, but one employee started slacking so hard and literally doing nothing since she was a cute 17 year old and the supervisor basically let her get away with it.  One night I had to stay late due to being short staffed and did most of the hard work with another guy closing up and found out that slacker girl left an hour early because her boyfriend wanted to go home from a day at the mountain and he was her ride.  I lost it on my supervisor for allowing this and went home. Next day something else came up (I can't even remember exactly what started it) and this time the older manager was there.  I normally never act this way but I was so pissed, I just chewed him out hard, literally insulting him and the supervisor for not doing their jobs and hiring morons.  I stormed off mid shift and walked over to the lift department and asked for a transfer.  I told them why, but fudged it a bit and said my manager suggested I look for a transfer because I wasn't happy there.  They hired me immediately and I was doing a different job within an hour and finished out the season there, which was way better.  I guess the manager at the tube park never told anyone in the lift department what happened to get me fired.  I kinda respected him for that at least.  Maybe he knew I was right.  Next year he wasn't the manager anymore, and the supervisor quit too.

Honestly, I don't even understand how anyone has any motivation to care at all about any private sector company they work for, unless you get bonuses for the the company doing well.  

This is part of why I chose the public sector - at least this way I care about doing a decent job for it's own sake, to help people.  At the same time, I'm in a union and have regular pay increases that can't change based on my performance.  If I do really well I might get a promotion in like 10 years when some manager retires or quits, but I'll likely be gone by then.  I try to do my job reasonably well but there is no point in trying extra hard to stand out.  It's also a work politics thing because if I raise standards to much then corporate will just find a way to squeeze more out of us for the same pay and come to expect it.  That already happens as it is, so it's really best not to work too hard or we'll all end up doing twice the work we're doing now by retirement, making the same salary we would have anyway.

A key difference I noticed between myself and them is having no fear of that at all, so I could freely mess around with things until I understood how they worked.  I may have screwed up our computer a few times experimenting like this, but always managed to fix it too.  In general, it's very difficult to break electronics just by pressing buttons - it would be very poor design if it was that easy to break.
