todayilearned,ffmkzgz,t1_fflranf,1580056094.0,"For me as an introvert the worst combination is an open office where I'm not allowed headphones. I don't mind the open space so much as long as I can listen to music and tune other people out but if you take that away, I just become constantly irritated and unable to focus."
fatlogic,fflvk1a,t1_ffjvw9v,1580044678.0,"I always find it hilarious when they try to cry oppression for being a ""disadvantaged minority"". First of all, obese and overweight people make up over 70% of the US population, so if anyone is a minority, it's the healthy weight people and second, they have enough money for food to make themselves balloon up to ridiculous proportions. How is that being oppressed?"
AskReddit,ffgpzgu,t3_etbrdf,1579912111.0,My old cat used to get offended when we told her she was fat. She would turn around and walk away and refuse to speak to us for a couple of days. People always think we make it up but she was able to understand lots of words and only reacted like that if my dad jokingly called her a fat cat (which he did often because he found it hilarious).
fatlogic,ffepflx,t1_ffca9yh,1579858839.0,"So you need to use a new pattern and way more fabric and effort, but if you try to charge for it the FAs will cry that it's unfair that the plus size clothes cost more."
childfree,ff2iog1,t1_ff0ri7s,1579507850.0,"Exactly. I love dogs, but I'm never going to have another one because they're too much work and I'm lazy. Does me not wanting a dog mean that I now hate dogs? Of course not. I just recognise the amount of work involved and decided to opt out. Same with kids."
Fitness,fed3n55,t3_eobmo6,1578997174.0,"For Redditors in the UK, Good Gym is basically this. You sign up, and then choose an assignment. It can be helping old people with their chores, or working in nature. The gimmick is that you have to run to the assignment and back, so depending on the distance you might get lots of exercise. I haven't signed up yet but I've heard good things about it."
fatlogic,fdlgmyi,t1_fdkgahr,1578523600.0,"Exactly. There are differences between heights, sexes and activity levels. For example, mine and my sister's TDEE are 700 kcal apart because I'm tall and fairly active. If she ate the same as me, she would gain over a pound a week while I would stay the same weight."
relationships,fbux1pn,t3_eedyig,1577121730.0,"No. The guy deserves better. Let him make his decision and if the woman sinks herself by being an insufferable black hole of negativity, that's her problem."
