Plumbing,ff4sul6,t1_felv70a,1579571624.0,Yes.
HVAC,ff4i6oe,t1_ff40fxr,1579564207.0,Nah it’s an older model. Gotta set dip switches.
HVAC,fewni6e,t1_fewiuuq,1579415790.0,Its just one of those things.
HVAC,fewngmd,t1_feu9pwx,1579415741.0,Yes i did. As well as build a wall
HVAC,fewmj9n,t1_fewm98d,1579414728.0,Not anymore. Grundfos 15-78 internal
HVAC,fewm930,t3_eqirsx,1579414419.0,Ah the famous Gutenouf vacuum.
HVAC,fewm6t5,t1_fewm0r1,1579414351.0,The combi units have always had an internal pump. Solos used to but now require a external pumps for primary and secondary
HVAC,fewa9gp,t1_fevaine,1579407470.0,I just looked at the other pics i have and it is indeed backwards. Good eye. Ill be sure to address it with my partner.
HVAC,fewa23r,t1_feukbao,1579407386.0,"The time savings from press is just amazing. Sure I can sweat pipe nice and pretty with fittings that are a 1/3 of the price but sweat takes easily twice as long even for the most seasoned and salty of pipe fitters. Press doesn't leak, trapped water is irrelevant, no prepping heat sensitive parts. I know press is considered by many to be a lazy approach but it is dramatically faster."
HVAC,fev688v,t1_fev5i8k,1579393532.0,Yeah thats why i tell my helpers to avoid street on gas pipe as much as possible. St. 45 are out of the question.
HVAC,fev2lon,t1_fev2945,1579392423.0,"Hmm hard to tell. Its possible, my helper has a bad habit of doing that."
HVAC,fev09d8,t1_feunrou,1579391713.0,"Thank you. I've never heard that about street 90s. I personally don't use them unless i have to but my helper did the gas and loves them lol. The code for the emergency switch here is ""at or within sight"" of the unit, also there was a top of the stairs switch. Good point about the valves. Appreciate the feed back."
HVAC,fettq97,t1_fetrbi1,1579379970.0,Thats a watts water feed. Its a new style we just started getting. You push down on the cap to fast fill and turn it to set fill pressure. White cylinder is a scale inhibitor for the dhw
HVAC,fettis4,t1_fettall,1579379895.0,Press as i go. If everything is loose its hard to get good measurements and keep things level.
HVAC,fetr6sz,t1_fetqxgg,1579378721.0,Yes. Float switch.
HVAC,fetn9mx,t1_fetiqi8,1579377126.0,Thank you

HVAC,fetlegd,t1_fetkfoh,1579376561.0,15 hours with a helper
HVAC,fet2n16,t1_fet29md,1579371274.0,Yeah they want it on the primary loop return on the combis. On heat only they go on the air separator
HVAC,fet2gvl,t1_fet28ik,1579371224.0,Oh its definitely more expensive. But the company wanted to go press and im sure as hell not gunna fight it.
HVAC,fet0l9m,t1_fet0cbn,1579370733.0,If I paid for fittings I'd consider sweat but once you go press you don't go back. Its just so much faster and easier
HVAC,feszgli,t1_fesz3a7,1579370456.0,"No idea, i just install. Warehouse guys take care of ordering and cost. Its definitely not cheap."
HVAC,feswv2z,t1_feswfmr,1579369765.0,Thank you.
HVAC,fenf2va,t1_femz9yo,1579283315.0,"For a while, my company was insisting that our service techs “verbal package” their invoices / what they told the customer and it was hilarious to read. For example; “ Found fault in thermostatically controlled refrigerant flow mechanism as well as indoor air filtration media restricted. Replaced 16x25 filtration media and resecured refrigerant system thermal measuring bulb to allow correct operation of the thermostatically controlled refrigerant mechanism”.  Translation; Found loose txv bulb and dirty filter.

It helped justify  800 dollar 30 minute call lol."
