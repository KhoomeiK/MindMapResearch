Psychonaut,ffj8mps,t1_ffj83re,1579993052.0,"I suppose it depends on what type of 5-HT receptors they each bind to, if they bond bind to mostly 5HT2C , it's probably very similar, not taking into account the other alkaloids."
Psychonaut,ffj7imq,t1_ffj647u,1579992334.0,"That's what I was thinking, if it's truly pure, it will be be pretty similar to a mushroom trip at higher dose. I think if it's not pure, it'll be slightly different from other left over alkaloids/etc.

Also curious on method of extraction or however you got it"

Psychonaut,fe8oa8u,t1_fe6t0mt,1578928503.0,"I'd like to teach basic permaculture gardening, critical thinking, basic health & fitness awareness, basic IT/computer skills. 

With that in mind, initially I will be looking for people that can do provide other ranges of skills and knowledge such as botany, mycology, chemistry and others.


At the end of the day, most everyone is going to be welcome. 


Rent, food, utilities, would all be provided for anyone willing to stay and/or teach/provide and anyone that visits to learn would need only pay for a way to get there and any sort of personal items. 

My goal would be to spread this knowledge to others around the world to help. 

If you're interested, message me and I can tell you more."

Psychonaut,fe36e47,t1_fe316zh,1578846429.0,"This would be 'free' as in you wouldn't need to pay any money , you would just come and learn and in exchange you would help garden, livestock, etc but of course this is what you're here to do anyway.

It's good to see others out there that care and have similar views :)"
Psychonaut,fe2zjf5,t1_fe2y8i9,1578844487.0,"I totally understand that deep yearning to focus your energy into a solution or to contemplate until some plan washes over you. 

To spend a dozen or so years doing this like a lot of your models before us have done ..well things happen too quickly now ... We're talking three to four presidential cycles, a whole census apart.

I think you can learn a lot more through acting and subsequent successes and failures. 

My goal to help people is to start a homestead/hostel that takes people in and teaches them how to be self sufficient. This is something that I actively work towards with every decision I make."
