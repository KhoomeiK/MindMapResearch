I mean, Big didn't really ""fight"" him, as much as he just got Froggy out from Chaos' body. Sonic even tells him something along the lines of ""I'll take it from here"", iirc."
Undertale,fecy5da,t1_febck4m,1578989413.0,"1. Okay, what's specifically wrong with the NarraChara or Corrupted Chara theories? And isn't NarraChara supported by the way the Asriel fight ends, anyhow?

2. Who's to say they had a choice but to help you? And they really didn't do anything to actively ""assist"" you 'til the end anyways, other than counting your kills for you.

3. Chara was, like, _10,_ at most? While this obviously doesn't automatically mean they weren't psychopathic, the point is that they probably wouldn't be coming up with any sort of particularly convoluted plans at that age. Case in point, if they were already a killer, why didn't they try to kill Asriel? Instead, they let themselves get adopted, lived with the Dreemurs for _quite some time_ without arousing any sort of suspicion, seemingly spent plenty of time with Asriel despite not really having to, faked their own death, fused with Asriel, (despite the fact that they almost certainly wouldn't have known they could do that when they originally fell, meaning it was obviously planned later on, unless of course Chara was just sitting there the entire time before they found out, twiddling their thumbs and idly waiting to stumble upon a way to become all powerful,) before finally dying. Yeah, Chara being evil all the way through makes _way_ more sense than them being corrupted.

4. I'll grant you that you never called them ""Hitler"", but the idea of ""eradicating the enemy and becoming stronger"" (again, Chara very well might not have been in their right mind saying this) is _literally the basis_ of Megalomania.

5. Finally, I'd like to point out that the interpretation of Chara being evil is _just as speculative_ as the interpretation of them being good. The game itself isn't really explicit on the matter either way.

Okay, I'm done. Thank you for your time."

2. For the record, when I say insane, I mean, like, full-on, completely lost track of the line between hallucinations and reality, hysterically rambling, ""pushed _way_ past the point of no return"" crazy. If you're going through a breakdown and need help, please get it, it's not too late.


3. There _are_ certain cases where hyperactivity is dominant over loss of focus, iirc. Personally, I have a hard time focusing on _anything_ important without my medication. Games _are_ admittedly somewhat of an exception, though.


4. I agree that we shouldn't have as many labels in our society, but how's ADHD one of them?  I mean, it's more convenient to say ""I have ADHD"" than it is to say ""I was born with a neurological disorder that makes it hard to concentrate and remember things, as well as making me hyperactive"". Just seems to make things easier to me, no offense meant or anything.


5. Yeah, our world is kind of a mess, but that's exactly why we gotta try to keep our wits and rationale about us instead of letting ourselves break apart and snap. If you don't think you can bear it alone, that's fine.
