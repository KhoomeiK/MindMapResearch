Futurology,fflo40c,t1_ffiqnpx,1580041963.0,"Yes. I peronally think it was the teacher union that started forcing people to get degrees. Putting money in election funds that pays off congress men/women and having bills pushed through. If you look at how teachers are teaching they have to follow the curriculum the school district and the government (federal/state) set for them. This is the american system I do not know, any other countries. I had a teacher in vo-tech that knew how to teach with his years of experience in his trade. But the laws started to change and he had to go back to school to get his teaching degree i think at that time it was a bachelors degree, so he had to spend money for other people to tell him how to teach. In my state a teacher is that is in the public school system is in a union, or pays the equivalent of union dues."

Futurology,ffh973n,t1_ffh4ode,1579926745.0,"Maybe, I think there are other factors at play. Instead of looking for blue color jobs, and going to college to get deeper in debt. Where it takes years to decades to payoff. Where if they went to apprenticeship programs they could have been in making money and slowly going to night school. I did the mirror. Working at night and going to school durring the day."
