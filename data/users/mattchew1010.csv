YouShouldKnow,fep20u0,t3_eq3b71,1579310367.0,"ok so just my opinion but i like targeted ads more because i'd rather get ads about stuff i like rather than something random. and google does keep data about your location this is also a thing i like, because i live in ohio and got a targeted ad for a free google home if i signed up for this free AEP thing. And the data is usually used in machine learning and im a programmer so i enjoy that part."
