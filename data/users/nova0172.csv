SuicideWatch,fdtixs8,t3_emwque,1578717423.0,Real Depression is long term sadness. Being sad for a day or 2 isn't depression it's just being sad. Being sad is a feeling being depressed is a state of mind that needs to be broken to be happy again.
SuicideWatch,fdd5k8n,t3_eklf5d,1578295752.0,Yes agreed. Once I'm depressed and suicidal I choose to go to this sub because it makes me feel comfortable that I'm not alone. Before coming to this sub I would think I'm in the vast minority of people being suicidal. And that maybe I was weird or mentally retarded or some shit. But I know for a fact most people just hate life. You can either cry and complain or you can just move on and keep going. I just can't get over stuff I choose to hang on and it just fucks up my life in the long run. I wish people weren't as hateful as they were in today's society. It makes me feel unwanted and it just makes me feel unloved I hate it here and I wish there was one reason for me to stay except for family and a few close friends but there's not.
