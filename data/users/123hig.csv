BlackPeopleTwitter,ffd7vm5,t3_esxp29,1579815131.0,"My mentor died *at our Christmas party* a couple years ago. The party was in the office.

I'd been working with him all morning and he was totally fine. Had me close the door to his office on the way out. Wasn't open back up until that afternoon when the party was starting when someone found him. He'd sent some emails and made some phonecalls before but I was the last person to actually see him alive.

It was on a Thursday. Basically they told us like ""Yeah we're open tomorrow but seriously, you really don't have to come"".

I prefer have something to be preoccupied with in such times, I spiral when left with nothing but my thoughts when grieving,  so I went into work. On the way in my path always took me by his the hallway his office was at the end of. His door would always be open and I'd shout in ""Hi Alan"". It was the first morning morning since I'd been there that the door was closed in the morning and there was nobody shouting back.

I thought about just turning around and leaving but then it would have meant I'm just back in my car stewing in my thoughts for another hour while commuting home. And it was certainly better than going to a bar at 8AM which was certainly a possibility. It was good to have something to do and have a little bit of normalcy.

People deal with grief differently. So maybe you might've needed a moment of silence or a day off, that's totally understandable. But that would probably make it harder for some people, it would've for me. So just do what YOU need to do to grieve. Take care of yourself. If that means you need to take a vacation or sick day- it is worth it. But it is never wise to look to others who are grieving, and expect them to grieve the same way or to expect them to help your grieve. Their head and heart is fucked up to."

You have to go back to 2006, three years before the expanded Best Picture at the Oscars to include 10 nominees, to find another movie that won Best Cinematography but wasn't nominated for Best Picture (Pan's Labyrinth).

Even when only 5 films were nominated for Best Picture, it was rare the winner of Best Cinematography didn't get nominated. Blade Runner 2049 was only the sixth such case in neary thirty years.

I don't think 2049 necessarily should have won Best Picture, but the fact that it wasn't even nominated and Darkest Hour, The Post, and The Shape of Water (which fucking won somehow?!) *were* is going to age incredibly poorly.

I think it reasonably could have stole one of the sound categories for Dunkirk. It felt pretty underrepresented in the acting categories based on the number of quality performances in it."

madmen,ff9yjby,t1_ff98toa,1579724260.0,"Pete wasn't in the wrong though. I am copying pasting this comment a left from a thread a while ago when that fight came up:

I think Lane was totally in the wrong.

\-Lane came into the partners meeting literally screaming mad

\-Lane was the only one that failed to see the absurdity of the ""chewing gum in his pubis"" thing, literally everyone else was able to have a laugh even given that they just lost an account

\-Pete was probably telling the truth that Edwin thinks Lane ""is a homo"", and that's the reason he approached Pete about going to the whorehouse. That absolutely sounds like Pete was recounting a drunken admission from Edwin. If Lane wants to do an autopsy of the account/his friendship with Edwin, he has to be prepared for the results

\-Lane calls Pete a monster and implies he is ungrateful, the first legitimate insults. I don't know what Lane really did for Pete aside from helping facilitate the start of the agency- something Lane was doing not as act of benevolence, but of self interest.

\-Pete asserts Jaguar was his account, which was 100% true, and that makes Lane explode just because he helped bring the business in. Ad agencies are structured in a way to play to peoples' strengths. There is a reason account people work primarily with clients and accountants work primarily with numbers. There is a reason to have one primary point of contact (Pete) between the agency and client. The account team is continually undermined throughout the series (most notably by Don, Lane in this instance, and later Joan) by people trying to circumvent corporate structure and do account work they don't have the expertise for.

\-The first real insult Pete makes is when he says ""Our need for you disappeared the day after you fired us"" which, frankly, is probably true. Joan was capable of doing the work Lane did.

\-At this point, Lane escalates the situation and tells Pete he is going to fight him after one insult.

\-Pete offers Lane an out ""Are you kidding me?"", Lane doesn't takes it, continues to insist on a fight.

\-Lane continues to mock/goad Pete by calling him a ""grimy little pimp"", even though it was Edwin's idea to go to the whorehouse, and this doesn't even seem to be an out of the ordinary form of client entertainment on Madison Avenue.

\-None of the other partners intervene. No one comes to Pete's defense as Lane continues to threaten him. Pete is left with no choice but to defend himself.

I like Lane but he lost his fucking mind and 100% should have been fired immediately after this. Don, Roger, and Cooper all failed to intervene as they watched their partners irreparably damage their relationship- both a professional and personal failure."

[365black.com](https://365black.com)

It is very strange thing for a company to advertise in such blatantly segmented manner along racial lines. She isn't making it up. They have a pretty long history of marketing efforts toward black people that feel... weird. Just like the campaigns have a very reductive view of black folks. Do a google image search of the McDonald's Get Down ad campaign from the 70s. Not racist necessarily, but clearly made by an out of touch white person.

I would imagine her problem with McDonald's is for one of two reasons, maybe both

1) No one likes to believe they are susceptible to marketing. So if a company advertising specifically to one group, one might feel a little insulted. Like ""how dumb do you think we are if you think this would work?""

2) McDonald's is unhealthy. So she probably sees McDonald's advertising to black people as some systemic racism trying to kill black people. This is, of course, very stupid. But would be consistent with the logic of woke people on Twitter."

If not for movies like The Godfather, I do not think people would really know anything about the mafia. The average American that is.

I am a college educated person and in all my years of study, the mafia was given two brief paragraphs in any history textbook I ever had. 8th grade. One paragraph explaining Al Capone, and one talking about the Valentine's Day Massacre.

Without mafia movies, I think Americans would be by and large totally ignorant of the impact of the mafia. Movies are by and large where people learn about the existence of the mafia. Especially post-RICO and the decline of mafia meaning they aren't in papers as much anymore.

Plus, without the movies glamorizing that way of life, you certainly wouldn't have all the wannabe wise guys- which has understandably led to Italian Americans having a bad reputation.

The problem starts with the mafia, obviously. They are to blame. But it was greatly exacerbated by The Godfather."

Don's problem is not an incapacity for love or connection, but an overcapacity. He didn't have a mother and he was raped by a prostitute as a boy, so he goes through the world desperately seeking out a feminine love that was absent for much of his life. Pretty much any woman he has a spark with, he falls for, which is why he cheats so much.

And I think people acting like nothing the woman is doing is justified is unrealistic. If someone came to your business and called you an immoral and encourged people to boycott, you'd want push back if you had any self respect. 

I wouldn't have carried myself the way the woman did, don't get me wrong. How she want about teasing them showed a lack of dignity, you can push without making a fool of yourself. And stealing the sign was asking for trouble. Clearly not the brightest."

If we're talking about an object that is nearly worthless, that will be discarded in a day, pressing charges for battery or theft would be incredibley insincere and a mockery of our justice system."

I'm just saying if your protest is threatening someone's livliehood, be prepared for them to push back."
trashy,ff4a2xk,t1_ff462qf,1579558837.0,"A poster board worth a few cents that will be thrown out the next day is not something a reasonable or mature person would call the cops over (I am assuming the protest did given the don't touch my property line).

If they legitimately assault you, fine. If they legitimately destroy something of value, okay. In that case if you want to call the cops fine. But calling the cops over a poster is a bitch move.

I am strongly against civil law suits over interpersonal spats. Just settle things yourself."
trashy,ff49qf1,t1_ff48sl4,1579558619.0,"I do not have the expectation I won't be confronted in life. People have conflicting interests and opinions, it is what it is. 

What I am saying is pricely that people need to be prepared for that. When confronted, confront right back. Don't be a bitch a cry when someone comes back at you, or sue if someone steals a worthless protest sign. Assume your protest will meet resistance and deal with it."

funny,ff4323z,t3_erg1r8,1579554463.0,"We start forming memories we actually remember throughout life at \~3.

And I feel like you need to actually remember like 5 years of a decade to have truly experienced it. But it is far to comp people the first like 2 years of the next decade as belonging to the next decade, especially if you have older siblings, as so much of the pop culture and fashion and whatnot will still be relevant.

So I think 1994 is probably the absolute latest could could be born to say you remember the 90s, 1984 to remember the 80s, and so on. Also, just being born before the halfway point of the decade makes it a pretty natural line anyway."

But that hasn't stopped (mostly white) writers from portraying them as 2D stock characters, one way or the other, for generations IN FICTION."

I'm a Millennial, used to be able to navigate Snapchat and Netflix no problem. Now I find them almost unusable. Because neither of them are for me anymore. I'm not who they are designing their product. I was, but I aged out."

Not a judgement call in any direction. Just an observation. Feels like millennial dads are the first generation to not parent almost exactly like their own dads."

If you don't want to be confronted, don't start a confrontation. A peaceful protest is a confrontation. Weigh how much you care about whatever you're protesting vs. how much shit you're willing to take. Many protests will still be worth it. Just don't be naive and cry victim if it is worth it."
science,ff3u3mr,t1_ff3lolq,1579548880.0,"Blame the continued proliferation of the noble savage trope in movies for people buying this crap. Movies like Dances With Wolves and Avatar. 

Hollywood over-corrected from the era when Native Americans were only portrayed as savages to today's trope where they are only portrayed as wholly good, peace loving, and green.

This should go without saying, but Native American tribes were just people before Europeans ever showed up. The warred and exploited the land as needed just like every culture across the world."
