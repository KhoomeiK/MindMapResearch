NoStupidQuestions,ffe1ve8,t1_ffe1pso,1579834529.0,"You don't deserve this. Make it clear, loudly, that you do not want this type of contact. Start documenting any time this behavior occurs and consider going to authorities if it escalates or persists."
NoStupidQuestions,ffe1nyx,t1_ffe1h7j,1579834377.0,"Please, please, please talk to another adult. Tell your mom this isn't normal behavior. You don't deserve to feel uncomfortable in your own home. 

Avoid being alone with him and clearly state that you do not want this type of contact with your brother."
NoStupidQuestions,ffe1fkq,t3_et42da,1579834213.0,"This is sexual assault if you do not consent to it. Please speak to an adult you trust as soon as possible.

AmItheAsshole,fe52v5h,t3_ensx67,1578865167.0,"Yta, it's not any of your business. Her logic with tindr is solid and valid. There was no expectations of exclusivity and she was simply trying to follow through on her promise to meet the other guy for a date. It shows she has the capacity for commitment and takes it seriously.

Why would you try to throw a stick in her spokes?"
MakeupAddiction,fdt6kw4,t3_en1q9v,1578712581.0,"Yellow and orange smokey eye, maybe a rhinestone accent on the cheek bones as a highlighter. 

Yellow and orange are complimentary to both pink and blue!"
CPTSD,fdol8he,t3_emgirl,1578607407.0,"Drinking to cope with my CPTSD was how I became a relentless alcoholic. The diagnosis was prior to the drinking, and as my drinking career grew, it heavily exsaterbated my CPTSD by creating new and worse trauma. 

I am sober now and working programs that deal with concurrent illness but I would just like you to be very cautious of how you are using alcohol.

I have a past that mirrors some key elements of your own and I want you to treat yourself kindly! Be mindful that kindness does always mean gratification.

You are worth more than you will ever believe. 

You are the only absolutely static thing in your life, so please treat it with tenderness. 

Best of luck x"

unpopularopinion,fdkqouy,t1_fdk989b,1578509155.0,"Ethanol is 100% a poison, a literal, poision. 

Smoking lowers your risk of Parkinson's, knee-replacement surgery and obesity. Christopher Wanjek, a Havard educated scientific journalist is my source for this lmao. 

Just like smoking though, alcohol has its benefits too. 

Your logic here is grotesquely flawed lmao"
