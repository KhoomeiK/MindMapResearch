motivation,fc4xsun,t3_eg0zmg,1577433035.0,"Hi, you still have a lot of blessings and positive situations in your life. Be grateful that you breathe and live. You have survived 2019 even it was so demanding, so don’t give up now at the end. Go forward and good things all happen to try with all your power to move on. Let go of the past to be ready for the future. I know is not easy but what is the alternative: depression, negative mindset, loneliness. Have faith in yourself all will turn around well. Have a great 2020!"
