funny,ffmkemx,t1_ffmhq2k,1580055922.0,"She never said she wanted the trillions of tax dollars going to help those in poetry to be directed to saving the planet. She said in multiple of her speeches about how she is fortunate next to those who have no clean drinking water, no eco systems to rely on. She wants everyone to live in comfort without fear of dirty waters or a life affected by the world dying. 

It’s the government who supports the multi billion dollar corporations who pollute our planet, doing incredibly illegal and dirty things. They pay off the government and continue to hoard their money because they want to be excessively rich in the most pointless way possible. That money could be used to protect land, build an easier infrastructure to support local 

Sure, she may be extreme, but without people being extreme change never happens. Look back at the 50’s Martin Luther king totally panicked the whole country with his extreme demands for change. Even though it is different the premise is exactly the same: people were terrified that the blacks were to get equal paying jobs, opportunities, health care. As they believed, the country was being robbed of its money to care for the whites. 

It’s been proven over and over and over again it really 
wouldn’t cost that much to make a change for simple things if they became normalized, but because it’s considered a radical idea it’s “costing too much”. Switzerland does it, as someone who grew up there, I can couche that it’s not that it’s difficult and too expensive, it’s that nobody wants to put in the effort or change their ways. 

Increase of local foods would be cheaper instead of being imported, housing can GAIN value when land is taken care of, and clean. I’ve seen it happen myself in Switzerland after they restored a part of the town with trees and demolishment of polluted rivers, a chalet went from 1.2’m to 3.5m because of the value of the land. 

No one is asking to rob the money from people who need it, but to stop putting money where it shouldn’t go to things that actually help the world. Once changes are made, it wouldn’t be a constant uphill battle and it wouldn’t be a constant hole burning at the wallet. 

Even though I see your point, each of them have been disproven and given solutions, but no one wants to change.

Secondly, say even if climate change was theoretically not as serious as claimed. What is so wrong with taking care of the world? Seriously? In what way does it actually harm people to watch for the nature of the planet and try to keep it clean and take care of the animals on it? 

It’s just illogical. It’s like hating a person for dropping out of a friend group to recover from alcoholism cause their friends drink all the time.
