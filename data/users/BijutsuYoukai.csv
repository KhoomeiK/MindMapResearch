MonsterHunterWorld,ffiqnho,t1_ffij9q8,1579980294.0,"Arena ANYTHING builds. Yeah, I get it, it's supposed to be challenging, but whoever made the Elemental Acceleration (Hidden Element to start) Parahammer set for the Garuga Arena quest needs to go stand in the corner because they've been very bad."
aww,ffiqaha,t3_etrn2k,1579980042.0,This makes me happy cry something fierce. It always tears my heart up in the best possible way to see animals like these without a proper home/place get the love they deserve so much.
MonsterHunterWorld,ffiodc3,t1_ffi19in,1579978706.0,"I think Kushala is a beautiful monster and aesthetically is lovely. However, the fight design in MHW is very frustrating and imo poorly designed unless you're using ranged. They should have kept the aspect of poison turning off/down her wind in addition to Elderseal if you ask me. Even in Iceborne where the clutchclaw is super helpful with flying monsters, her main trait negates that unless your clutch to the head - a terrible plan in flight - or use rocksteady, which can be dangerous to use against Kush if you're not careful, as those tornadoes are particularly not friendly without knockdown.

&#x200B;

In MHFU I actually don't remember having nearly as much trouble with Kush. Then again, the armor skills beneficial against her also were on different monsters I believe rather than coming specifically from Kush (Since to properly negate her wind you need Negate All Wind Pressure specifically) - hunting horn buffs not considered here in World."
MonsterHunter,ffgzytp,t3_ethuqa,1579919429.0,"My only issue with the layered Astral thus far is SO MUCH clips through it. Wanted just the arms because I like the flowing nature, but the only belt I could find that didn't clip a ton was the Diver Belt. Also I wish the hint of blue wasn't there when changing color - it makes it a little harder to properly color match."

DigimonMastersOnline,ffgz1vk,t3_etil5l,1579918742.0,"My Salamon egg today was one of the few I have gotten that wasn't a 3/5, surprisingly. Only 4/5, but I'll take it. Got my Digi-Egg of Hope all ready as well. Now when I am actively playing again I can raise my own stun-machine."
MonsterHunterWorld,ffgysit,t1_ffgc8mp,1579918547.0,In a game about hunting/killing monsters I'd honestly rather they not be leaving any next of kin behind I can visibly see because then it would just turn that triumph into the feel bad on orphan monster babies :(

MonsterHunterWorld,ffdp19z,t1_ffd62fb,1579825583.0,"They actually do fly at rare points in game. Pitfall trap a Diablos/Black Diablos and they'll fly up when they get out the trap and settle right back on the ground. They're just too dense (physically, not mentally) to fly much more than that."
MonsterHunterWorld,ffdou44,t3_esynb2,1579825458.0,Kirin being an elder dragon makes more sense when you actually look into what a kirin/qilin is in myths. Dragon-horse/dragon-deer thing basically.
AskReddit,ffcm9es,t3_esps5n,1579802452.0,That the person I love will eventually grow bored and leave me and I'll have no real reason left to live. Totally irrational but the uncertainty sometimes brings me to tears and some very unpleasant thoughts late at night. That and bees as I have apiphobia.
MonsterHunter,ff9o556,t3_es9fdr,1579717075.0,"Kiranico isn't the end all be all either. Just the other day for example I went there trying to find drop rates for MR Kushala Daora. Nothing. So while fextralife isn't 100%, neither is Kiranico. I'll use whatever I google that happens to have the information I need."
TooAfraidToAsk,ff5kbfh,t1_ff55y88,1579596972.0,The problem is this same person would likely also be the kind who thinks you can't be prejudiced against cis or straight people (like the people who think it's not possible to be racist if you're non-white). These kind of people don't really use logic or their brain in general (If they did they'd realize how stupid their argument is).
MonsterHunterWorld,ff57tsn,t3_ern3h7,1579582771.0,"Challenging is fine. However, there are some fights that go from challenging to straight up BS (Looking at you, Luna Nova Spam). So far though, aside from MR Luna being Luna, I think the difficulty is fine. Most monsters I've had trouble with at first have gotten better as a I learned. I will say the amount of blight (Ice blight, water blight, blast SCOURGE) is a bit annoying, but not really anything as much as adding to difficulty."
MonsterHunterWorld,ff4qvu5,t1_ff4pbf0,1579570270.0,"I carted about 10 seconds into my first Scarred fight. Put on Rocksteady, hopped on his face, dead. Was really confused until I came back and saw why it almost instantly took me from full to zero. Then the laughing began. Turns out Temporal won't save you either. Also, given the range of his fireball field/multifireball, bow against him sounds like hell, since it covers most of the area you want to be in."
MonsterHunterWorld,ff4qop7,t1_ff4lw7j,1579570135.0,Beak slam hitbox seems actually fair from my experience. Now Scarred's multi fireball? That's a lot of boom radius :(

aww,ff48ngg,t1_ff44xf7,1579557941.0,"Yeah, I'm aware. That doesn't change the fact they both have patches of red on their bodies, unless you'd like to correct me on something else I didn't state in my original reply?"

MonsterHunterWorld,ff3nv4v,t1_ff3h10i,1579545057.0,"With bow (Likely the same applies for LBG/HBG) I like to keep getting damage in on the monster I am hunting. If I know the turf war fairly well, I'll do the same thing with melee also. Otherwise staying back and preparing to continue the fight is a good  plan."
MonsterHunterWorld,ff3nn7k,t1_ff2y823,1579544924.0,"It's not just PS4. I had this happen twice in a row just yesterday on PC. Lured a Pukei-Pukei, showed up for a moment, then replaced by Lunastra. Tried a Kulu Ya-Ku lure after beating Luna, same deal. Appeared shortly, replaced by a Velkhana. I've also had the game just flat out eat my lures and just.... never summon the monster. Twice with Cora Pukei-Pukei and once with another monster whose name I can't recall."
aww,ff3m3t4,t1_ff3kuzf,1579543966.0,"Get off your high horse with that 'falsely claim' junk. Claiming faith to a particular god doesn't suddenly make Christians exempt from making assholes out of themselves or going against the basis of their religion.

MonsterHunter,ff2hhzt,t3_er73kf,1579506356.0,"Either use proper level of windproof and haul ass away or superman dive multiple times and stay down as long as possible since the damage doesn't tick if you're lying down from it. Be sure also to bring astera jerky to heal up any red bar fast, because she's usually on your pretty quick after the nova is over."

Pretty close to just a normal pickup though."
