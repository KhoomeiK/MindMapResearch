My depression now stems from my complete disappointment in the human race. 

So my whole childhood I was groomed to believe marriage and parenthood was the goal of life. 

I realize the lies I was told mostly because religion is bullshit. Yet I still buy into the lies about marriage and parenthood. I was told I would find a person who cared about me as I did her. That I would have a partner for life through everything. And because I saw the benefit of this mutual support concept and reproductive interest, I bought in heavy to the idea of finding my partner. 

No. 

Marriage is a tax write-off supported by lobbyists who also maintain zero taxation of religions. It is a push to maximize offshoring from people gullible enough to be working class. 

Everyone is so quick to point at me and say I should learn from my mistake. The only mistake I made was believing shit anybody ever said to me. 

Not a single person I have spoken to trusts their spouse. I know this because at most they share a small part of their income to pay bills. None of them have completely merged accounts. Some trusting partnership. 

Women are in it to use you as the income they think they deserve for being ""special"". They are all the same. They wasn't you to buy gifts for them, do shit for them, tell them what they want to hear. What do you get? A wet hole.

I was devoted. I was dedicated. I did everything asked of me by my wife. The year her income was higher than mine she threw me out.

Probably just didn't want to make an excuse for being back on birth control while taking company trips. 

Anyway. I now have a better job. Im not just a working class shmuck. Not a single one of them has a stay at home spouse or joint account. The very method used by my wife to take advantage of me. The same situation I was told I should look forward to as the provider in marriage. 

Fuck women. They are trash sold as something you need in life. They are at most a wet hole with something resembling personality. Don't buy into that bullshit they sell that you need one for anything other than wetting noodles. 

Fuck em. Leave em. Find others.  Repeat."
