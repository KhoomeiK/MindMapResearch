the state of charge and condition of the vehicle battery

the outdoor temperature

the number of vehicles charging at the location simultaneously

My cell phone isn't a vital extension of my body and I can deal with not having amazing service for a good discount. I pay $40 a month for 5GB, and that's plenty for me.

The 63 that leaves from Eagleson just disappeared off the app. I usually catch it from Eagleson but decided to take the 168 across the highway, along with everyone else at the stop so I could potentially catch one from downtown in case he didn't show. I saw the bus show up at Eagleson from the app, then he disappeared, and ended up having to wait 10 more minutes to catch one from downtown.  My guess is he saw there was nobody at the stop and just noped right out and skipped the route."

The smaller top one is great because it heats up so fast and is great for small things like pizza. You can cook anything that isn't too tall including things like lasagne or muffins. Also good if you need to cook 2 things at once. Comes in especially useful during the holidays. My oven recently died and I replaced it with a similar model. They are more expensive, but I don't think I'd ever want to go back."

Also, I doubt they pay retail for their sticks.
