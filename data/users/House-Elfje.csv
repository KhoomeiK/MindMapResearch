ChoosingBeggars,ffexy5c,t3_et5j3h,1579869890.0,Absolutely a terrible woman. But bringing washed clothes back in the same bags that held the clothes from a kid with scabies really isn’t smart. Those clean clothes are now again covered in the buggers.
longhair,ffcuutk,t1_ffcunwv,1579807727.0,Perhaps terms translate differently. When you talk about ‘thinning hair’ you’re generally talking about someone having less hairs on their head than they used to.

longhair,ffbnjn3,t3_esqrbr,1579774320.0,"Thick or thin refers mostly to how thick an individual hair is. You can have a lot of very thin hair, a lot of very thick hair, a little bit of thin hair or a little bit of thick hair, each combination giving a different outcome."

IncelTears,ffbf4v5,t1_ffbf1x8,1579762591.0,Someone being overtly pushy about pursuing a relationship is often deemed to be less attractive. I found my partner on tinder - believe it or not - when I was just on there because I was incredibly bored.
IncelTears,ffbe691,t1_ffbe2ip,1579761474.0,"Which is definitely understandable, but you can’t let that define who you are. The harder you search for it, the less likely you are to find it."

A coworker of mine was single and a virgin until he was about 45 I’d say - not a very close colleague - and he went on singles trips - not to meet a partner but to meet other people that enjoy doing their own thing but didn’t want to go everywhere completely alone. He met a lady there about two years ago, in the same boat; mid-forties, never had a boyfriend, virgin etc, and now they’re married. It’s never to late dear."

IncelTears,ff8y7ct,t3_es4tpq,1579699883.0,"But just imagine proposing a man be the property of the woman and watch all hell break loose. Its crazy right? Owning your son or husband? Yes. Just as crazy as owning your daughter or wife.

longhair,ff3dkqo,t1_ff3bz7d,1579538966.0,"Oof.. tricky one, I think you need a really good deep condition in that case. If you just had it trimmed it will be dry as opposed to split ends. Not just coconut oil but try something your hairdresser uses."

I had to travel for over an hour - because I wasn’t in the vacinity at that time. I checked, okay, I need to come in right? Yes. Okay, fine. I get there, completely soaked and bruises on my face from the hailstorm and I haven’t even changed to my work clothes. ‘So turns out we need to cut the staff because of the weather’. I clearly volunteered to stay but they preferred the younger ones because they were about 4 bucks an hour cheaper so I was sent on my merry way.
