mildlyinteresting,ff1stnf,t3_er4p4u,1579485398.0,Your neighbor is awesome.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,feeesc6,t1_feedpfm,1579032267.0,Yep! You would rock it.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,feedf4f,t1_feecw0j,1579031463.0,"Go find some coats/jackets/shrugs which hit you mid back or at the top of your waist. By the time you add gloves, scarf, and hat, you will be warm."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,feedarm,t3_eoq43g,1579031392.0,"You do look great. Try to steer away from any habits of always adding a top layer of a long cardigan, sweater, jacket, or duster. Keep wearing form fitting clothes that appeal to you but then don't wreck the look by hiding under another layer. 

If you are feeling exposed, hunt down (thrift store!!!) some long sleeved dresses you can wear with tights and boots (or booties). You will feel very clothed and still look stylish. 

Prints are hard. I struggle with prints. However I realized my ENTIRE closet was solid colors, so I started embracing prints/decals/designs/text more often. It made my outfits look more fun and less frump. 

Experiment and enjoy yourself!"

Baking,fcp3w01,t3_eickj8,1577849671.0,"Curious: can you make the same recipe and let us know if it was better after you let the dough age overnight? I have not been happy with my pizza dough and the overnight thing seems to be the recommended  solution. 

If you are already know your dough recipe is a good one (and your pic looks awesome), I just wonder if it would be better or worse after sitting overnight."
AmItheAsshole,fcp3nz0,t3_ei3fv5,1577849478.0,NTA. I have a feeling my mom will react horribly if I tell her I‚Äôm planning on traveling to Petra. I plan on sharing all my photos of the trip with her once I‚Äôm BACK.
Hair,fcp35yw,t3_ei9qd9,1577849043.0,"Doing faux hawk French braids and curls will be so much easier for you now! Ponytails will look better too. I have hair just like yours, did this cut this year, and have been ridiculously happy ever since."

Hair,fc9zlax,t3_egue8v,1577560577.0,If you cut it shorter it would look good I think. Short mop? You have a nice face and should show it off.
