PublicFreakout,ffe9lez,t3_eszeh7,1579840491.0,"People who don’t put their carts back are fucking cunts. I worked at a place at a plaza, and the whole black top was just a big funnel pretty much. If anyone didn’t put their cart back in the corral, they went FLYING. One time a cart hit one of my managers cars and fucking put a hole in it. The worst part was the store couldn’t cover it and obviously no one is held responsible. 

That’s fucking bullshit. Just because you can’t put a cart away in a corral 5 parking spaces over means that some unknowing person has to dish out cash and take time out of their day and shit to fix it. 

Just put your fucking carts away. You’ve been pushing it around the store for an hour, what’s another 20 seconds. Fucking seriously."
