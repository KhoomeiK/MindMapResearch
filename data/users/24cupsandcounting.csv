todayilearned,ff4kpd5,t1_ff4eek9,1579565957.0,They were worse because of the limitations of the equipment. I just felt like OP’s comment was a bit misleading and made it seem like goalies used to be many times less talented or something.
todayilearned,ff4dt26,t1_ff4dong,1579561237.0,"Oh for sure, but they were also taking advantage of developments in the equipment. Ken Dryden probably could have done the same if he was born in 1965 or something"

But in truth, the material of their pads back then was like a sponge, and heavier. Not only was it harder to drop down and get back up quickly, doing so meant their pads got even heavier because of how they absorbed water"

boardgames,feeeojt,t1_feedy8p,1579032204.0,"I can’t disagree with you on that. I personally haven’t faced trauma of Holocaust magnitude so it’s hard to say whether this is necessary. Keep in mind that the game wasn’t outlawed, just pulled from a few stores, so it’s not exactly censorship."
boardgames,feednd8,t1_fedh807,1579031598.0,"Yeah. The store discussed in the article is located in an area that has quite a few Jewish people and that community has been there for a long time. Many of these people are the children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews of survivors, people murdered by Hitler, or are survivors themselves. So I respect their position on this game, since Hitler impacted their lives far more than he did mine."
boardgames,feed281,t1_fee8alu,1579031253.0,There are a lot of individuals around that area whose lives were impacted greatly by the Holocaust. I respect their disapproval of being reminded of something that may have destroyed their families.
AskReddit,fee1wi0,t1_fedvec5,1579024679.0,"Really stuck to the hits. It was his farewell tour so didn’t waste time with the B sides or push new stuff on you. His voice is not exactly what it used to be, mostly in that he can’t hit all the high notes, but it’s good in different ways. A song like Crocodile Rock maybe he’ll miss some high notes, but then some songs really shine like Daniel and Levon because he can definitely knock those out of the park. The latter he played for 11 minutes and it was awesome. You have a lot to look forward to"
