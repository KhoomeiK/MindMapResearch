I think i can connect easily with people online, because usually you can talk about more stuff genuinely since you dont know each other and dont really see each other. Then you can just agree to meet sometimes when you feel comfortable. At least thats what works for me."

Meaning... I didnt have any complain about the company ive been working for, for many years, because i was happy, i was respected. When i got bullied and my reputation got  ruined because of gossip, when it was unprovoked and i was really innocent, i felt really unhappy and started seeing bad regarding my salary, work hours etc. When in truth, it was just the environment affecting my mood.

Go for happy job. Because stress can make you sick and even if you get paid well it wont heal your heart. Unless u use that money to save and  and find another job."

I was lucky to be in a relationship with a man (my first relationship) who never hit a girl, he set a high standard for me, a healthy relationship, solving problems with words and love, not violence, that i can compare my new relationships with. We didnt end up together, i  thought a life in church wasnt for me. So whenever i get into a new relationship, i see a red flag, i leave.

Also, if you are shy in real life at least do online dating, start with long distance dating at least try it. My first relationship was long distance (i was a teen) and we only saw each other after a year. Same experience really, love/fight, only difference is youre physically far apart.

When I was younger around 9-teenage years, I would be the one in between my mom and dad whenever they get into a violent fight. I never cried. I was forced to be strong, be the voice of reason and stop things before they escalate. But when it happens, do you know the feeling when youre trying to help but you know youre weak and cant stop it? When I look back I didnt deserve witnessing those horrible things. No one deserves it. 

Both my mom and dad are abusive to each other. I cant think of a day when we never had arguments and most of them ended in violence.
