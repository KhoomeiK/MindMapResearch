Veterinary,ffa8dnr,t3_ese2eu,1579729877.0,Depending on education of each technician and if they are persuing higher education I believe their pay should be based on that
Veterinary,felx0hr,t3_epue9v,1579233063.0,"About to go to pre-vet but I have some good connections within Ceva Animal Health. From what I've heard R+D with chickens used for poultry is extremely lucrative, they also need avian vets all the time. I'm sure you've also heard the suicide/ depression rate of vets that treat companion animals are extremely high so take that into account when you choose your specialty. Personally Bovine and equine are better options for me. Hope this helps xx"
