About the comments. There will always be assholes and cuntbags in this world. You have to rise above them. It's part of life.

And about you asking what's the point in posting? It's not a question that we can answer. Do you enjoy doing that? Then fucking do it! It's as simple as that. Do you get joy from it? Then you do it. There are way too many people doing things they don't enjoy for you to join that club as well. Yes, if you're going to put yourself out there, be ready for everything from negativity, to hate, to plagiarism to the more beautiful part of the internet where there's encouragement, appreciation and love. What matters is you don't let it affect you. You do you, boo."
