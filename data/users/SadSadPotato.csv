SuicideWatch,femab90,t1_fem9s9o,1579245767.0,"I doubt it, I don't even post here consistently. I don't mean to be contrarian (even if it is like my only personality trait besides sadness and binge eating) but I feel like such a non-person, you know? I've let everyone down, I've pushed everyone away, isolated myself from everyone and become such a freaking iceberg drifting out in the middle of absolutely nowhere. The only thing keeping me here is my dog, and she's already quite old herself. I just feel like I'm rapidly running out of options, that I'm getting far too old for all of this and either need to get better or get lost, and I've been trying to get better for so long and for what? To be here on my own, feeling like dirt because I have nobody? What were all of those years for, why did I ever bother making good memories with people that just make me feel bad that we don't talk anymore? I could literally just disappear and no one would know or care.

Well, I guess a few people I've been talking to here, today would notice, but even so, I've done this before. I always end up ghosting people because I'm flighty and scared and I spiral all over again and everyone forgets about me all over again and it is entirely my own fault. I can't let anybody hold onto me, I genuinely do not know how, so I take the easy way out and let myself drift away and be lonely. Give it a month of me just forgetting to check in on Reddit and guaranteed, my presence will fade once more.

It sucks, feeling invisible and disconnected from everyone and everything around you, but it's liberating in a masochistic sort of way. You know nobody cares about you so you are free, to also stop caring about yourself. It becomes so easy not to bathe, sleep on time, eat consistently, go outside. It becomes so easy to cease existing. That's the thing, I'm already dead, and nobody cares or has cared. I don't want to sound like I'm raging against the world (I guess I kind of am???) but, I haven't been ""here"" for a while. It wouldn't make much of a difference to take it just that teeny bit further.

idk, it's late and I'm sad so I'm sorry for being like this, I just don't really know what I'm doing with myself anymore, and it is so hard to care."
SuicideWatch,fem7awn,t1_fem5j6i,1579242325.0,"Or family or even acquaintances who they're on good terms with. I am a full-blown hermit, I doubt anyone would even find my body in my own apartment until a week or so later. I try to care for myself even with no one else caring but, it's hard."
Needafriend,fem59ua,t1_fell62e,1579240237.0,"Over-stimulation is a problem for me as well, and it blows but some people, through no fault of their own, are more draining than others. I've learned the hard way not to point this out to said people...

I suppose that's another part of it, is socializing and becoming good at it and comfortable around others is mostly trial and error but there are so many variables to account for and every now and then someone completely throws you for a loop and the ol' anxiety starts acting up again until you just remove yourself from the situation, which is just plain difficult to explain to people, especially in the midst of that anxiety. Well, I am glad to hear from someone dealing with the same feelings, thank you."
Needafriend,fel45nm,t1_fel3rpg,1579213666.0,"If you would, imagine a potato. Imagine holding it. Now imagine it rotting in your hands, a disgusting withered thing of no value to anybody. I cannot be salvaged, I am simply a waste.

But that's kind of depressing so let's just say I'm a good ol' Yukon gold potato. I probably would've made for some bomb-ass french fries in my day but, alas ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

What kind of work do you do, if you don't mind being questioned by a sad potato?

EDIT: I am so dumb, I thought you PMd me and this was private, wow."
Needafriend,fel3dz7,t1_fel371j,1579213194.0,"howdy, how goes it"
SuicideWatch,fel1enp,t1_fel0vro,1579211971.0,"I doubt they'd link this account to me, I'm pretty particular about keeping all facets of my life separate. It'd amount to ""welp, let's haul this corpse out and clean this mess for the next tenant."" Nothing about me is or would be newsworthy, I guess besides what a sloppy fat horder I've managed to become. Ugh, that'd be even worse than just being forgotten, I pray I'm forgotten.

EDIT: It's foolish to think they wouldn't be able to link the account to me, but I doubt anyone would care to. I'm not harming anyone, I have no great plans of any sort, good or bad. I am a nonperson."
SuicideWatch,fel0rdo,t1_fel0f43,1579211588.0,"Eh, that's nice of you to say but it's just not registering right now, I'm sorry. I mean, I could just off myself now and literally nobody would know, online or in person. Well, maybe my dog might alert somebody, or the eventual smell, but otherwise I might as well not be here. I honestly hate people being nice to me, I genuinely don't know how to respond but with apathy and doubt, I'm sorry."
SuicideWatch,fel0i22,t3_epp45l,1579211436.0,"Same, I'm ashamed of my kinks and fetishes and the way I'm always either thinking of death or thinking of sex. I feel so gross sometimes. If it's any consolation, you're almost guaranteed to be less of a pervert than I am..."
SuicideWatch,fekzz7l,t3_epmh3y,1579211124.0,"I used to, when I had loved ones. No one cares anymore since I fell off the face of the earth. I'm basically only alive out of spite at this point."

No one in my life even knows who I am anymore because I don't reach out to them anymore, nor them me, no one believes in or loves me. Hell, my own mother thinks I'm useless, and in my current frame of mind I am inclined to agree. If you knew me, you'd probably agree too. I mean, here I am being a downer on a happy post because that's all I'm good at. idk, I'm too sober for this."
AskReddit,fekuijs,t3_ee3b1i,1579207872.0,"I want to vent but I have nothing concrete to vent about, just general vague feelings and thoughts bringing me down. I'm an alien struggling to find my place amongst humans and wouldn't you know, nobody wants to be probed ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I just feel lonely and kind of detached. Everything feels unreal, like a hazy dream, the kind that kind of disturbs you and sticks with you long after you wake up but you can't remember anything specific about it. I feel like I am a dream or a memory or a vague feeling or thought fashioned after somebodies fragmented idea of what a human is. Also I no longer have any friends or family members who I trust with my emotions so there's that, lol

I'm mad at myself because here I am complaining about feeling sad when it is entirely my own fault that I'm sad and others are dealing with real issues. I guess depression is a real issue but I'm the one sitting on my butt all day and doing nothing to fix the issue. I feel like the embodiment of wasted potential. Every used to tell me how smart, funny, nice I am but I just feel useless. I wish I had a friend but I don't deserve one since I'm awful at reaching out to people, I am a bad friend, content to sit at home and be sad and useless. I know it's learned helplessness but I still feel... helpless. My anxiety keeps getting triggered by dumb things that don't matter and I realize they don't matter so I get mad at myself again and I get depressed again and I just wish I could melt and drain into the sewer and never have to deal with feelings again."
AskMen,fektrz8,t3_egf0l1,1579207439.0,"I don't feel like a genuine human being. I feel fragmented like a foggy memory. I'm questioning if I even am or want to be a ""man"" and questioning my participation in society as a whole. I'm lonely as hell and there is a massive word salad in my mind PLEADING with me to be let out. I feel lazy and worthless and like, in spite of my efforts and the progress I've made and all the therapy, I'll always be depressed. I'm confused and nothing feels real anymore."
pics,fbzi6yg,t1_fbyzlba,1577247527.0,"THANK YOU. My family is trash and I'm tired of people implying (or stating) that I'm ungrateful or selfish for not talking to them, or that I need to maintain a relationship with these hostile strangers who just so happen to be related to me. I need to be away from them for the sake of my mental healtg, and I'm glad I finally realized that and acted on it, and I'm not sorry about it either. Have a happy, stress-free holiday season, I know I will :D"
