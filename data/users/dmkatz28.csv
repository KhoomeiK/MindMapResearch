As someone else mentioned, I think filling the garage with a ton of water bowls and leaving a window cracked to toss in food is an acceptable method of keeping you safe and keeping the dog from starving (idk their housing layout but maybe you can rig up something creative with rope through the window to open the door?). Hopefully the owners pick up their damn phones and come home ASAP. I'm so sorry you are in this situation."

You are looking out for your dog and trying to do the best you can for her, which is very admirable! I think an hour walk with a dog walker would be an awesome way to keep her busy. It is cheaper than doggy daycare and would be less stressful for your dog. Do you feed her from a Kong? It helps keep them busy when you leave for work. Especially if you hide another one around the house to keep her entertained. Feeding puzzles are a great way to keep your dog mentally busy while you get to relax for a bit after work. If you can commit to a short walk or jog after work, I'm sure your dog would be thrilled. Best of luck!"

A morning bath would be fine if he has time to dry off during the day. I would worry about stressing the dog out with a bath-he probably has never had a bath before. I would play it by ear-if he tolerates being gently restrained by a collar, maybe start with getting him used to being handled and brushed and work up to a bath? Would your apartment manager let you keep him in the garden? People are very cruel to street dogs-they might be nicer if he smelled nice and had a collar? Adult dog food is fine for his situation. Young dogs love to teeth-cardboard is fine for him to shred. It won't hurt him to get him vaccinated and checked out by a vet. What are the ownership laws like in Turkey?"

My father dislikes pets (namely dogs) and has reluctantly tolerated the surprise cats that my mother and I have acquired over the years. He grew up with cats and loves to complain about them while petting and playing with them. :p dogs are a wildly different story-He refuses to touch or acknowledge any dogs that my friends bring over, aside from complaining about the smell/fur/risk of being bitten/make jokes about eating dog....etc. It really really sucks not to have a dog but give it a few years when you can afford it and have a stable job :) The best you can hope for is them tolerating having a dog in the house when you come visit."

I'm out of the house 70+ hours a week for school and spend much of my limited free time walking/playing with my 9 month old kitten (my boyfriend also spends an hour playing with her daily) and I feel guilty about not spending more time with her. No chance in hell would I have time for a puppy, I actually turned down a free puppy from a friend recently (which broke my heart because she was lovely, great with cats and super sweet)-your schedule is even busier! Yes it REALLY sucks not having a dog. But waiting until you have more time is not only better for the dog but better for your current cat.

I've heard people say that it can take about 3-4 weeks for cats to unwind around the new canine interloper.

Zelda retaliating to a swat can EASILY kill a cat. Keep the dog leashed, keep a room gated off for the cats (keep a door closed when you are not home-a bored dog can often figure out how to get over a gate) and make sure they have lots of escape routes. alternatively keep the dog crated and let the cats loose. redirect the dog when she wants to play with the cat/whenever she fixates on them and reward her when she is calm around them. she needs to learn not to play with them. how long have you had the dog?

They don't do OFA testing on any of their dogs or really any health testing-this is a really really big deal for merle dogs-they carry lots of genetic defects associated with blindness. The breeder don't show their health contract (ie puppy clear from genetic diseases, certified free from dysplasia until 2 years of age...etc), just a vague promise of having them vaccinated and dewormed. They are also sending puppies home at a little over 7 weeks, which isn't ideal (8 weeks is pretty standard). And they claim both parents of one of their sires is health tested-I could only find one of the parents in the OFA database and they only tested for hip dysplasia. Having a list of distantly related champion relatives doesn't really mean much health wise. Also the lack of application is a big red flag-it implies that this breeder will sell a dog to anyone. Below is a link with info on how to find a good breeder
https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/wiki/identifying_a_responsible_breeder 

If you are looking for suggestions for a breed of dog for a family companion, you might want to fill out the breed questionnaire (see link in sidebar). Border collies are crazy high energy-they are not what many people want for a fun family companion. I have met a lot of neurotic BCs. If you want a merle family dog and can handle a herding breed's drive, an Aussie might be a better fit!"
dogs,ffomm4z,t1_ffohuaz,1580079221.0,Oh I also love it when people ask if any dog is friendly before petting them. It just makes me sad that people are so much more scared of big dogs and their phrasing reflects that.

He was an absolute gentle giant with toddlers and small dogs-the best behaved doggo! a neighbor has an Irish wolfhound that she walks off leash on the trail (this senior citizen has lovely recall and a 100% will not react to dogs/toddlers/squirrels...etc)-I love watching people quietly panic when they see 140lbs of shaggy giant plodding along, unrestrained!"

dogs,ffgil8i,t3_et9s97,1579907062.0,"I think a golden retriever would be a better option than a MAS. Goldens are fantastic at obedience, they are sweet, forgiving and overall really fun dogs. I've never met a MAS that is remotely calm-I'm sure there are ones out there that are well bred and well trained but all the ones I've encountered have been high strung, yappy and suffer from some degree of separation anxiety-these are not good qualities in a college dog, especially one you want to take to lecture.  A golden puppy is a sweet nippy goofball but they tire out a lot faster than any herding breed puppy. Have you looked at adult golden rescues? If your parents are on board, it is a lot easier to deal with an adult rather than a puppy. I think everyone else has made excellent points as why not to get a dog in college so I won't bother typing that out. :p Not having a dog makes traveling a LOT cheaper."

It is very easy to teach a dog to bark on command-in fact, it is great to teach them this cue with hand signals only. If your mom is walking the dog and she feels threatened by someone approaching, she can subtly cue the dog to bark, likely scaring off many potential attackers. The first 2 years will be full of insane puppy energy/teenage nonsense until the dog matures though. have you read any of the training books on the puppy wiki?

I know a few at a local dog park who are fantastic dogs-they are very handler focused. :) have you looked into finding a reputable breeder? I definitely recommend getting a book or two off the recommended list on the puppy wiki-they make for excellent reading while you are in the puppy acquisition process (which usually takes at least a few months through a good breeder, especially if you need to stay local)."
dogs,ffdwkvc,t1_ffdsi3m,1579830716.0,"sounds like non shedding is the way to go then! I would NOT recommend a Giant schnauzer-they are very high energy, they bark a LOT and are very territorial (which is not fun to deal with! I grew up next to a territorial dog that was great with kids but would actively attack their parents when they tried to pick them up-it was a nightmare, the dog was eventually put down after seriously biting several people and attacking many of the neighbors(he even scaled a 5 foot fence to bite someone walking outside of his yard)).  A Portuguese water dog or a Poodle might be a better match. Poodles come in many colors  and look really nice when they have a normal cut (ie you can just shave their hair). The standard poodles I have met aren't overtly friendly with strangers (ie they will let you know when the mailman approaches but won't actively guard you from your inlaws), are highly trainable (they are VERY smart dogs) and have moderate energy levels. Plus they are a good size and the black ones with a puppy cut are stunning dogs (most people only think of poodles as a white). PWDs are higher energy than poodles and they are a tad more vocal than poodles though. crate training and an indoor playpen is the best way to keep your stuff from being chewed on during the puppy phase. have you looked at the puppy wiki? they have tons of great resources that can help you prepare for your future dog. :)"

What do you define as low shedding? Standard poodles are great dogs, super smart but they need regular grooming. If you can tolerate some shedding, that widens your options for breeds.

Buying the puppy a Kong will help keep the puppy busy/not destroying furniture-plus your employers will be impressed that you are so invested in having a good relationship with their dog. I would crate her when she hits witching hour if you don't have time to deal with it. Or else prepare to tire her out earlier (fetch/run around in the yard) then put her in her crate before she goes bonkers. Puppies usually have a schedule for when they are acting up (for instance my neighbor's golden puppy was a furry tornado of terror at 8 pm, like clock work!). When she is aggressive, I think talking in a calm voice and trying to get her to settle/redirect her to a toy is a great thing to do. Puppy 101 has some great tips on teaching a dog to settle and controlling nipping!"

My mom is retired and walks a neighbor's dog for free since she loves dogs and wants a hiking buddy (and my dad hates dogs). It is awkward but very possible that you could find someone who would like the company (and on a fixed income would be happy with some extra cash while they get to feel good about helping you out)-ask your building manager? Would he be safe for someone who is elderly to walk (ie not leash reactive, can't easily pull over someone who is frail)? Even if they can't walk the dog, they could come hang out and provide company so your brother gets a break. Better yet, you could probably find a college student who would love a dog without the financial responsibility-a professor at my school got free dog walking by basically ""renting"" her dog out to trusted students to walk on campus (he was the sweetest, most bombproof senior giant doggo-he loved moseying around campus making friends with everyone) while she taught classes. Your girlfriend is totally right to be frustrated-it is a tricky situation! Take your time to explore your options."

But that's why it is nice to visit a few breeders and find one that appears socially competent (assuming you have the luxury of having several reputable breeders within driving distance!). I know of a breeder who apparently suggests that you take a hike with his dogs before coming to the kennel-which really turned off a friend. But I imagine that it is how he interviews potential dog owners/weeds out anyone who isn't physically fit enough to care for a RR. Not letting you touch the puppy and her carrying it to the car is pretty ridiculous.

Do you have limbs hanging off? - ER! Always call an advice nurse or your GP-they can direct you to the right place!

The first day, she hid in a closet for hours, refusing to eat or drink because she was so stressed (she is nothing if not dramatic). By day 3 she was so damn bored and curious that she wanted to be back with her people, regardless of the canine interloper. When the puppy was asleep and safely leashed, we opened the doors. My cat eventually was brave enough to willingly approach and sniff him-she even was gently swatting at his tail and approaching him while he was awake later in the visit. My cat is a total wuss.

There's a decent chance they didn't lock their back door and you could just walk out through their apartment with the dog (and keep her safely crated inside until animal control takes over). Also-have you taken pictures? This helps the case for animal control. Alternatively, what floor are you on? If you can climb over and secure the dog in the crate, you could once again tie ropes to the crate and lower her down (ideally with help from friends).

I'd wait to post any reviews until you talk to a local rescue- they would know local abuse laws (and if they are actually enforced) and potentially libel laws. The mousetrap trick should be grounds for animal abuse. Do they define improper care in their contract? Did the rescue tell you any of their ""training"" techniques in writing? Can you play dumb and email them for a summary? Having a paper trail is really important. Do you have any friends who would be willing to contact them, pretending to be interested in adopting?

If she is small enough, you could tie a strong rope (ideally two thick ropes, so that you have a backup/can stabilize the cage in motion) to the handle on a cage trap (Ace Hardware and Home Depot carries raccoon traps-this only works if the dog is small enough-be wary of their tail length!), smear peanut butter on the plate, toss it over the top and wait until she triggers it, then drag her back over to safety (wear thick gloves and ideally have a friend to help you stabilize the trap)-this should be a last ditch effort, trapping an animal is very stressful but better than freezing to death. You could also chuck a cardboard box with towels inside over the partition, but I don't know if this would provide enough shelter.

I would definitely make sure everyone in the house understands what is considered ""trained"" (ie house broke, social/tolerant, no resource guarding & won't opportunistically shred furniture/drywall)-maybe even posting a list of rules so no one gets butt hurt that their sweet precious baby (who tries to disembowel anyone who walks near her food bowl) is being singled out."

dogs,fef30wm,t1_fedtzam,1579046990.0,Ah gotta love the GSD puppy lunge/lick/nibble combo-nothing like 70+ lbs of land shark flying at your face to demand affection. :p I don't miss the puppy days with my neighbor's GSD.......
dogs,fef2s0z,t1_fedxcg6,1579046823.0,"O.o I have a friend who believes ""oh you just have to love them"" to end up with a good dog. No concept of how to train any animal-she is used to friendly cats that keep themselves amused outdoors (nature is their litterbox) and come inside to cuddle (the same friend thinks keeping cats indoor is cruel). Thankfully she hasn't expressed an interest in dog ownership."
dogs,fef22l7,t1_fedxnbe,1579046350.0,"X) so accurate! I wish more 20-somethings seeking insta fodder were smart enough to not get the dog in the first place! That being said, my group of 20 somethings live vicariously through the few of us that have dogs (all of whom have yards & work from home or have dog friendly offices)-summer bbq's are better with dogs! Plus they get free pet sitting from all of us dogless dog people :p"
dogs,fef0q4k,t1_fedzvso,1579045456.0,"I'm also glad that they were smart enough to realize they are not a good home relatively quickly! Too many people get a husky/GSD/doodle...etc puppy from a crappy breeder and neglect it until it is an untrained, undersocalized teenaged terror then dump it on the side of a road or in a shelter. I'm glad they could suck up their pride so quickly and hopefully learn from their mistake. People will be people and fail to go their research. And even if they do their research, I strongly believe that they should take care of at least one dog of that breed for a couple weeks to get an idea of what they are getting into. What we think we can handle is often different from reality. I thought I could deal with caring for floof and frequent barking-1 week with a friend's moderately vocal double coated mutt proved otherwise (It really helped solidify that love my RRs)!"
dogs,feet6sd,t1_feeluv3,1579040683.0,"Moving is a hassle, especially if your rent is cheap. But also not dealing with roommates can be nice, especially ones that bring over untrained dogs. cheap fencing isn't too hard to make if you happen to have a decently narrow alley in your backyard. You can get pretty creative with a piece of plywood (25$) (home depot will cut it for free), a bit of digging and chunks of rock- it won't be pretty or permanent but should hopefully keep the husky safely contained. Diving a full backyard in half would be far more expensive. I'm sure your SO would rather pitch in to make a ghetto fence than move. My SO is also happy with most living situations so I'm the one setting boundaries with roommates too-it can be really frustrating!"
dogs,feekfao,t3_eonht3,1579035544.0,"you mentioned fleas on the husky-maybe you could mention that to your roommate? she might get grossed out about him bringing the husky over. I think being bitten by one is enough reason to have a right to be extra cognizant in this situation. I think dog proofing the garage is a good middle ground to keep everyone happy. That being said, untrained bored huskies are fantastically destructive-maybe ask them to get an exercise pen so he doesn't destroy your stored items? Dividing the yard might be too difficult, depending on the size of your yard (maybe if you have an alleyway that could be blocked with wood and cinder blocks? ideally on cement so that the dog can't dig out?). Personally I would have serious concerns about any dog that isn't potty trained and has bitten multiple friends being allowed at my house, regardless of size, so I think you are being pretty lenient in that regard!"
dogs,fdshgq1,t3_emqz5k,1578702830.0,"Labs might be a good fit! A well bred Lab is a great family dog and running buddy. Goldens are also lovely but I'm biased towards labs since I grew up with them & prefer their coat. A friend of mine (also an avid runner) has a Vizsla who is great with his toddler. I think if you get a well bred puppy and are really on top of the training, it would work out."
dogs,fdlfhfh,t1_fdipt7p,1578522893.0,Many pet stores have microchipping clinics that are really cheap (like 50$)-often cheaper than the vet! It is vital that she has your information if you ever break up and want to keep the dog.
