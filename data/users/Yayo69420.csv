KidsAreFuckingStupid,ff9bqw7,t1_ff95bn4,1579709341.0,"Nicotine definitely has a high. It causes the body to release adrenaline and dopamine. I get that the average smoker doesn't really get the high from a cigarette but I chain smoked when drinking.

unpopularopinion,ff97q06,t1_ff96d7j,1579706787.0,"Thicc is pretty literal. If a woman is 5'7"", going from 115 > 140 is unlikely to make her outer appearance fat but it will definitely add some inches to the waist. Some men prefer thinner women, some prefer thiccer.

Calling a woman wide would be much more insulting than thicc IMO. Thin will likely remain an acceptable synonym for petite for a while so I think thicc exists to describe women that are attractive but not thin.

Fat remains as an adjective with negative connotations. Thicc chicks arent fat tho, they just have fat (thicc thighs save lives)"
