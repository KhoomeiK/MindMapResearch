offmychest,fgjo0id,t1_fgii324,1580847971.0,"The people criticizing us are the people who think you should just tough out an unpleasant/unhappy/soul sucking job just for the sake of having one, even though there are other options that don't crush our souls completely. They are also the ones who would probably stay married till the day they die even if the person became a complete and utter curse to be with. ""I'd rather be depressed forever, mask my pain with copious amounts of alcohol, ooze negativity into every interaction I ever have, and wish for death than break my promise/leave this job (I gave them my word, they expect loyalty)!""

Sorry, no thanks man. I'd rather not be miserable forever lol. Now, I don't think you should leave a job until you've secured a replacement, but then I'm the sole earner in my household so it would be incredibly stupid for me to leap without anything to catch me."
offmychest,fgjn2ww,t1_fgjgk2j,1580847427.0,"And that goes sooo far! Being happy (or at least relatively) at work makes it so much more worth it. I left a job about 9 months ago where I felt likei was no longer valued as highly as I deserved. The bosses were good people, but bad bosses (very poor management skills). On a personal level they were great for about 2.5 years, but they let their thieving addict son steal from the register, use drugs in the bathroom, take 45+ minute breaks without coverage (waiter), etc and it took a spiritual toll to the point I had to leave. Now I make a bit less but I'm so much happier where I'm at, my ideas are met with enthusiasm and constructive criticism and there's no effing family drama. It's great!"

bartenders,fgelpw4,t1_fg5cw2h,1580702652.0,"Each of these were a situation where a young man walked up to the bar, ordered a couple of drinks and left his card up front with me and the other bartender (as we always do when it is someone we don't personally know) and repeatedly came up ordering drinks for themselves and their friends, adding to the running tab. Then the cardholder(s) got cut off, and I didn't allow them to continue purchasing alcohol regardless of who it was actually going to be drank by and since they didn't want to order food or anything I cashed them out, then they didn't tip :)"
