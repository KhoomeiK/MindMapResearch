raisedbynarcissists,fdjvjgo,t1_fdjs3s2,1578488902.0,"I am wondering if you are suggesting that this mindset towards my mother is coming from a place of narcissism within myself? I can acknowledge the possibility I am just not sure if I am misunderstanding what it sounds like you are inferring. 

I think I can see your perspective and how adapting it may be beneficial but I want to note that I have also been in positions with this person where that ""oh it must be something I don't like about myself"" mindset was actually somewhat debilitating because it was invalidating anything I felt about how I should be treated towards myself.

Very interesting and enlightening comments. Maybe I should be focusing more on healing inside myself instead of focusing on the injustice and therefore trying to change her behavior.

Thank you for your input! I appreciate your concern!"
raisedbynarcissists,fdjrm0l,t3_eln5li,1578484898.0,"The interesting thing about that movie is the ""mother"" also feeds off of Rapunzel, and in return keeps her isolated and scared of the world, unable to trust others. It's definitely an amazing allegory. I have actually related and turned to that movie myself. Even as a 20 some year old woman!"
raisedbynarcissists,fdi7n0s,t1_fdi1zl9,1578437186.0,"I feel that you might be right about that. It is a growing process. 
Thank you for your encouragement!"
raisedbynarcissists,fdi0ct8,t3_elcpj7,1578433468.0,I would absolutely get away from your mother. I have dealt with situations very similar and I have learning that it's not your job to fix stupid.... and it's definitely not your job to fix mean!! Your mom needs to get a life and stop expecting you to be her best friend while she insults you because she's bored! She can go learn some social skills with people her age or treat you kindly. End of story! Keep on keeping on! ;P
raisedbynarcissists,fdhyegx,t1_fdhtnwh,1578432424.0,"Yes! Thank you! It's so annoying. It's like, I feel like I'm saying ""I need someone to be a mother to me"" and then she goes ""I need someone to be a mother to me too!"" Like seriously!!! LOL WTF!!!!"
raisedbynarcissists,fdhy5o8,t1_fdhdu5k,1578432291.0,"That is a good point because realistically... what difference does it make... THAT is the question I should be asking. And I think the difference would be that I would feel a lot less bad about no contact knowing her true intentions, and would be more confident in myself trying to explain needing space to her. It's harder when there is the possibility of her trying her best.... that makes me feel like maybe I should somehow ""be the adult"" for her..."
raisedbynarcissists,fdgl1tj,t3_elb0bw,1578400909.0,"To clarify, I think the cognitive dissonance was coming from a place of uncertainty about what perspective to hold towards it, because of how similar the two are. The one is- ""she can't help it, she's just trying to cope with her being insecure,"" and the other is ""how dare she purposely sabotage me because she can't come up with the means to be or become her own person...""

more or less it's the same situation. I realize now I was just confused about which intention was motivating her and it probably is because she is both people and on occasion does switch them up. Anyway I realize I am talking to myself at this point but I think acknowledging that has helped a lot. I should be more able and comfortable moving forward with this now!"
raisedbynarcissists,fd9qhzq,t1_fd2x2bv,1578236701.0,That post was one of the first I wrote. I am really sorry. I only found reddit because I was taking advice on how to grow my blog. After I started recieving messages saying that I was spamming and violating the rules I realized and stopped what I was doing. If it is possible I have stopped adding links to my blog. And I can promise you it wont happen again if I could please rejoin!
raisedbynarcissists,fd9pmc9,t1_fd2x2bv,1578236430.0,I understand. Sorry I wasn't focused on the right things at first. I do not want to take reddit for granted. I have realized how blessed we are to have these communities and I do not want to lose the opportunity to be a part of them. Thank you so much for another chance!
raisedbynarcissists,fcy9y1i,t1_fcy812g,1578076858.0,"Thank you so much for expressing your appreciation! Your words to me, mean a lot as well!!!

:)"
raisedbynarcissists,fcxagef,t3_ej9b56,1578057343.0,"I have made similar decisions recently with my own relationship with my narcissistic mother.

I think it's interesting because throughout my life, I have found problems with management, and other women in my life, particularly the one's who had a position of authority over me.

While I never meant to have this problem, it did seem that the hold my mother had over me was affecting me everywhere I went.

But who could I turn to? Well, at times the only option available was my mother.

I mention this because I noticed that a lot of the times was what I was actually doing, was trying to address my suppressed problems with my mom, with her. 

I had been trained more or less to instead project these realities on to other people, and then try to somehow resolve them at home.

My mom I realize now, would constantly expose herself when helping me ""address"" these ""problematic"" women. She more or less encouraged me to have the suspicions I had against her, against everyone else, everywhere I went.

Everyone had bad intentions. Everyone had the qualities she had herself. And eventually it did start to become clear, just how exactly she had so much insight into what was going on in the minds of these women and others who at some level were trying to sabotage me."
raisedbynarcissists,fcx64cf,t1_fcx5q38,1578052803.0,"Awh I am so glad to hear that! And thank you so much for your support as well! 
:)"
raisedbynarcissists,fcx53gn,t3_eje6gc,1578051585.0,"I also have a covert narcissistic mother, except I live with her! I try to limit even being in her presence as much as possible. I have felt her very being to just have a really negative impact on me, and I use her words I have heard her use for other people when describing her.... I believe she has ""an oppressive spirit,"" at least, towards me!

I in the very least can't deal with the back and forth inside my mind of ""she's abusive... she's not abusive.....she's abusive...."" because it seems like all I can think about when I'm around her. It's like just seeing her puts me a in a confused cognitive dissonance where I don't know whether to protect myself or not, but at the same time I sure do not want to just let go..... 

that's why I just focus on me now. I've had enough of that. And luckily I'm old enough now and my meds are helping me make the progress of realizing a mature relationship means I do not rely on her opinion or try to please and therefore enable her, because she likes my attention, every single moment of every single day... ugh! 

Glad you have had luck here. I feel it is a very wonderful thing too, to have so much support through other people's words and personal stories!"
LifeAfterNarcissism,fcx2tiu,t3_ejal6k,1578048739.0,"Wow, I relate to this so much! Feeling obligated to ""people please!"" Super impressed by the way you just trusted your intuition. I am just learning now how to face opportunities as something NOT of scarcity myself. I think it's inspiring how you made a decision knowing you deserved better for yourself.

Also super sketchy that a former-potential employer would reach out to you like that."
NPD,fcx2824,t3_eif5us,1578047968.0,"I am actually focusing more on myself and my personal goals. I have stopped making excuses for toxic people, and have finally embraced what it means to have self-respect and to not enable. I am going to spend this time being more dedicated to my personal potential, talents, and growth."
NPD,fcx2311,t3_eipkqd,1578047792.0,"I would focus more on your personal growth. Do you have any hobbies? Artistic talents? Interests? I mention this because the more you find you are able to put your attention on something else, something healthier, the easier it will be for you!"
selfimprovement,fcx1wpn,t1_fcw1mkx,1578047560.0,"Maybe focus less on ""succeeding"" then, and worry more about your own personal happiness. What makes you happy? Do you have an artistic talents or hobbies?"
selfimprovement,fcvu9k1,t3_dlhs9u,1578010242.0,I have a blog. It is about my recovering from C-PTSD from narcissistic abuse. I am just getting started but I also plan on adding other topics involved self-help and ect. I am not sure you would relate but I thought that I might mention it! Maybe you could google something about a particular abuse or success stories for better luck finding what youre looking for
selfimprovement,fcvtygg,t3_cdy5l8,1578010041.0,I just recently started doing this myself to address my C-PTSD. I think it is a really good idea because I have felt my blog has already been a somewhat healthy and motivating outlet for me! Especially beings you too planned to focus on your self-improvement!
selfimprovement,fcvts79,t3_cu3oak,1578009930.0,"I just recently started blogging and I have found it has been a very good thing because it is in a way forcing me to focus on my own progress, self-care, and mental health!"
selfimprovement,fcvtmd5,t3_dlhs9u,1578009825.0,I have a blog called [gaingroundonthefly.com](https://gaingroundonthefly.com) It is about my recovering from C-PTSD from narcissistic abuse.

selfimprovement,fcvtfnu,t3_ej4t3k,1578009704.0,"Yes. I always make list and then feel myself overwhelmed and unmotivated because of the length of the list.... I would recommend switching it up! maybe get visual instead like with a vision board. Go for a walk! Get some cardio! Or maybe just force yourself one step at a time without planning. See what you can accomplish and for how long before you start worrying about any kind of list. 

I believe I might try taking this exact advice myself! Thanks for mentioning it! lol

(and I hate to admit it but it is probably more laziness and our liking the idea of starting than actually us getting started! lol)"
selfimprovement,fcvt1nq,t3_ej2qg4,1578009455.0,Have you seen a psychiatrist? I suffered critically like yourself for years. I did FINALLY find relief from an ssri (zoloft!) Is there a reason in particular you suffer so horrible from depression and don't feel like you will ever become any stronger?
selfimprovement,fcvsrs6,t3_eixloq,1578009278.0,"I actually suffer from C-PTSD and am recovering I should say. If you didn't know, it is basically the worst kind of self-sabotage because we are carrying the narcissistic abuse that we endured psychologically in our heads wherever we go. Defense mechanisms can be crazy and seemingly impermeable. Basically, it sounds like you are afraid of the leaving the comfort of who are you behind in stepping into that next step. I would explore visualization and what it would feel like to you if you were successful. Maybe you can identify some feelings you didnt realize you had that are blocking you in your success.

Also... cardio! Or exercise! I feel like often if you can exercise you have a lot better chance at tackling anything else because you are basically training your body to work for you rather than against you which helps your mind and spiritual growth and all as well.

You could also talk to a psychiatrist and see if they would recommend an ssri to you. It may sound extreme, but a small dose may aid in helping you extend beyond some of those barriers and self-sabotaging behaviors.  Especially if it is something you feel you do excessively or is negatively affecting your overall health!"
selfimprovement,fcvs3i3,t3_d85b0j,1578008843.0,That is a great revelation to make. It is so important and hard to do because we feel that we are somehow faulty because of how our brains cope to trauma. It is great that you can identify the difference between it being your fault and it being something that you have accepted responsibility for and are trying to manage! Super proud of you as well!
NarcissisticAbuse,fcv1cvu,t3_eitsg9,1577992621.0,"Oh my god yes! This is probably the most humiliating of concepts that I somehow just found myself dealing with recently. I guess they call it inner child work right? 

I had no idea a person could be so stunted. But that is something that I have seen from narcissists before and in extreme cases it is called infantilizing someone. 

I don't know how they do it but they somehow manage to strip you of your integrity and make you feel so emotionally naked you might as well be a child. 

I think it has a lot to do with their own childhood trauma and feelings of insecurity and I think in a lot of ways they are probably very able of subliminally enouraging these sort of immature or adolscent aspects of ourself!

For me it's worse, likely because I am just starting to take steps towards my recovery from my childhood and on abuse so I never really did healthily find myself as a person. 

I did eventually find help from SSRI's that have worked though... thank god!! I did not want to be around myself constantly flashing back to such childlike symptoms of inferiority! 

This is a topic I will have to be sure to include on my blog! [gaingroundonthefly.com](https://gaingroundonthefly.com) where I cover my progress in addressing my own abuse and C-PTSD. Thanks for this post! I needed this mentioned! 

Feeling stunted like a child as an adult is the WORST kind of crazy! LOL!"
NarcissisticAbuse,fcv09ta,t3_eizi6a,1577992029.0,"I agree! This is the new year and for the first time ever, it might really actually be a new me!

I was just thinking today, I don't even want these people anymore.... I do not even want the narcissists approval or love! I never thought the day would ever come! I thought ""yeah, he's flawed but he's a good guy"" (a project guy... ugh! super hot though!) or ""yeah he's abusive but he's also a victim of trauma...""

HELL NO! not anymore. This year it's about what I DESERVE, and I'm not feeling bad about that anymore because I was taught to. I am not that personal anymore. I am not scared to be ""above"" somebody else when I fact know that I am. 

New year! new me! (I am still recovering though. I feel a little too optimistic in response to this post but I am also still recovering from C-PTSD and sometimes other examples of low self-esteem or behavior from narcissistic abuse) but I am also addressing these things and taking the time out for myself and my own peace mind. Especially with my blog [gaingroundonthefly.com](https://gaingroundonthefly.com) anybody is welcome there if they would like to join me.. I am just getting started so I appreciate any help that I can get!!!"
rant,fcuz6a0,t3_dk3gmm,1577991427.0,"Hi! I write about some of my experience and advice on my blog! [gaingroundonthefly.com](https://gaingroundonthefly.com)

Feel free to check it out. I hope it helps you.

A lot of it I would recommend to you would be self-esteem work. Separate yourself from the opinions of others. Do not go into denial about what some of your fears are. What triggers your ptsd? What exactly are you scared of? What do you think it is you can do to address this problem. Even if it you cannot resolve it completely."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fcuy2bk,t3_ej16vn,1577990812.0,"Honestly the only tips I could give you specifically is to try and label what exactly it is you are scared of when it comes to asserting yourself against this person. Are you scared of what they think or are you scared of what they think being true? 

Are you scared of conflict? Disagreement? Talk to yourself in the mirror. Prepare answers for what you think you might be avoiding. I hope this helps! I don't know your exact situation or the person. This is just something I have discovered recently that has helped me!"
LifeAfterNarcissism,fcuwwwb,t3_eiet5y,1577990173.0,"Hi! I write about these feelings a lot myself! Check out my blog [gaingroundonthefly.com](https://gaingroundonthefly.com) and let me know what you think! I need all the opinions I can get and I would love to hear if you relate. So far it sounds like you do!

I know I started taking SSRI's again which did help me a lot with my cripplingly low self-esteem. I still battle with what you're explaining a lot as well. I cover codependency, boundaries, and my tips for progress and such a lot on my blog. As well as try to address some of my paralyzing need to control so much. Check it out and let me know what you think. Hopefully it helps!"
LifeAfterNarcissism,fcuvsoa,t3_eiubdj,1577989554.0,"It's not terrible. It means you empathetic. The problem with those of us who have endured narcissistic abuse, is that we are often overly sympathetic to others and not enough to ourselves. I would be careful that you are not actually psychologically lying to yourself.... trying to care for others when you in fact feel that you are incapable of actually caring for yourself....

Do not enable your narcissistic ex by coddling him. That is not love. That is also abuse in its own right (which is good because that is not what WE need either)

codependents and narcissists often share similar fears and issues, which is likely why you are so sympathetic to his. I would try to refocus on yourself.

LifeAfterNarcissism,fcuus94,t3_eiq2h5,1577988949.0,"Hi! I am so sorry for what you have been experiencing. I am also a victim of narcissistic and sexual abuse. I invite you to check out my page on my recovery tips at [gaingroundonthefly.com](https://gaingroundonthefly.com) I would love to hear your thoughts!

I know a lot about the chronic self-doubt and shame that you are experiencing although I must say I am rather impressed with how much more you have actually survived!

I understand your fear and guilt towards your friend.... I would feel the same way!

However I think it is important to remember that YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR BRINGING A NARC INTO YOUR FRIENDS LIFE!!!! YOUR JOB IS TO CARE FOR YOURSELF. IS ANYONE APOLOGIZING TO YOU FOR YOUR ABUSE! NO! IS THE NARC APOLOGIZING! NO! DO NOT INTERNALIZE THE FAULTS OF OTHERS. STOP GIVING LOVE TO OTHERS!!!! THAT LOVE AND THAT FEELING OF GUILT AND BEING STUCK IS BECAUSE THAT IS THE LOVE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE GIVING TO YOURSELF!!!! I know it is confusing. I know that it feels real. But please practice coming more from a place of seeing from a different angle what truly might be more rational as far as to what you are experiencing psychologically. Check out my latest post! I think you'll relate to a good bit. I go over this idea a little more on my site."
