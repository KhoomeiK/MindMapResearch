It's odd to me that we have so many abandoned or mostly abandoned towns in the US considering how many people work in the service industry and are in need of affordable housing. US companies should start moving Midwest for cheap real estate and people could seek corporate/warehouse/shipping jobs in these abandoned areas.

 I know nothing about these things just postulating. 

There do seem to be quite a few grand, old looking buildings in Gary with some interesting architecture, but I've never done urban exploration myself. As it is I live in an east coast state with a pretty high population."

They had paperwork over the sink and provided litmus paper specifying exactly how many ppm of bleach its supposed to be, I would say it was pretty thorough.  This was in the state of Oregon and I personally was present for several inspections and it was never raised as an issue as long as the measurments were correct and our log books were being updated.

We also had to document freezer and refridgerator temps twice daily"

Also, did it grease the inside of your asshole like nobodys business or what? How many days of the shits does a bagel covered in a cream-cheese-level-layer of Crisco translate to? Because I use cream cheese quite liberally."

AskReddit,fer7jqk,t1_feqrnh9,1579350794.0,"Yeah I mean, that's why I hesitated to make that claim with any real conviction. 

I do genuinely believe that a decently sized population could benefit from it but that doesn't make it a miracle cure for anything and in fact it can negatively effect people. 

A good friend of mine with pretty bad already existing anxiety would smoke with me occasionally, and I feel bad because I may not have accounted for that combined with his lower tolerance which may have contributed to him having a pretty severe anxiety attack. He wasn't with me at the time, but his sister, and they had edibles but I still feel like I was the one who introduced him to weed in the first place. 

I feel like its really important for newer smokers to really ease into it so that 1 they don't freak out, but 2 so that they can actually enjoy a nice mellow feeling and not be turned off because they think pot is just supposed to make you freak out."

2: by lowering their inhibitions (sometimes depending on the strain), which allows them to relax a bit and be more comfortable talking to people.
