SuicideWatch,fej7q2u,t3_ep6iui,1579160433.0,"Try to find a good life coach and see a shrink if you absolutely can’t do it on your own. Not all of us are strong and some of us are in a daze of believing they are weak. You just need that extra push of love, wether it’s from a professional or higher power (God)"
PS4,fej6xww,t3_ep41bq,1579159446.0,I was concerned about the difference till I saw the little water mark. I couldn’t tell which was supposed to be the new one “better” one. (I think the one on the left looks waaayyy better than the one to the right)

SuicideWatch,fd3tg9e,t3_ejuas4,1578161484.0,"We all have our own mental cages we’ve locked our selves in. Some are harder to escape, and others are as simple as walking out of a relationship. But the physical difficulty in situations doesn’t out-way that fact that you are hurting. And you entitled to feel that way or any other way. Don’t beat yourself up or hide in your sadness. Embrace and overcome your cage, and don’t do it alone. If you need strength go to someone strong and as them how to get there. Bringing professionals into the picture can get nerve racking at times. But it’s worth knowing the full gravity. And unless your family are all demons or dead the unconditional love is waiting for you. You are perfect. And if that wasn’t true you wouldn’t be here in the first place. For this harsh world has no room for half-assed lifeless sacks. You are real, put into this world for a purpose. Don’t sell your self sort for nothing less love."
SuicideWatch,fd3ovq2,t3_ejrq7u,1578160417.0,"I know. It seems everyday the illness inside me takes over more and more. Makes me think that I’m weak or empty, without any purpose. For a long time I was stuck in the mind set of “no one will listen. And even if they did they wouldn’t care”. But it’s simply not true. I spoke out to my mother about how I have this desire to die, must be hereditary it think. I started therapy soon after, which didn’t end well on my part but it can do wonders for many people. You have to realize that there is ALWAYS that maybe even one hand reaching our inviting you into salvation, wether it’s the hand of Jesus or your nana it still counts. It’s still there."
