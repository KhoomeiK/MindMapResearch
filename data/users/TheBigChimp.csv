MMA,ffiv7z6,t3_ettdto,1579983529.0,Round 4 of Conor vs Nate 2 was a 10-8 in Conor’s favor and the fight really wasn’t very close at all.
books,ffi0vvu,t3_etmr06,1579961694.0,"My brother and I talked about sad books recently, I said 1984 was one of the bleakest I’d read and he laughed at me and said you think that’s bad go check out The Road. Looks like I’ll have to do that."

Boxing,ff1e4xi,t1_ff1dxdn,1579478033.0,Yeah ok go coach him lol
Boxing,ff0bn9i,t1_fezughq,1579467306.0,"Stating there is more he could have done is just as obvious as me stating what happened lmao, truth is he didn’t do those things and looked super disoriented after the second shoulder shot. How about you go get your nose broken and see how you’re thinking after lmao."
MMA,feysw3c,t1_fex2ass,1579450207.0,"Usman did it a bunch of Woodley during their fight and plenty of fighters throw them when they’re pressing their opponent to the cage, ive never seen them be actually effective or cause significant damage though, and that includes with Jones."
Boxing,feycw75,t1_fey42ww,1579443905.0,"Yes like that, Conor lead immediately with a straight left then Cowboy clinched to try to slow the pace down. Upon doing so he got his nose broken and eye bruised with shoulder strikes that I’ve personally never seen work effectively out of the many, many UFC fights I watched. I think everyone expected early damage but who the fuck could have predicted it via shoulder bumps?? Definitely not Cowboy and he said as much post fight."
MMA,fewt9t2,t3_eqt54i,1579419159.0,"It’s so fun to see the fan in Conor when he talks about Cerrone and his head kick record, it’s better for the game when he is active. Let’s see what happens, Gaethje, Masvidal, Khabib 2 are all compelling fights."

MMA,fedgwkk,t1_feaxix3,1579011204.0,"I think he is, he’s said god bless after fights before and did in the recent embedded. Maybe he’s a little more in touch with his faith now that he’s put the liquor and coke away for the time being."
MMA,fedgbmx,t1_febl2es,1579010760.0,"If I recall correctly a big part of the interviews for Conor during the build up was how real and how intense the training sessions were, he said multiple times that the intensity was high in the sessions and they had video of him dropping sparring partners in the promo footage, but like, fuck sake. That’s just wild. Say what you will of his conduct but Conor is a once in a life time fighter and athlete. This man went 4 with khabib and snuck a round from him while having multiple, real fights in camp followed by 3 day benders after. He could win a rematch I’d bet."
MMA,fede62j,t3_eok5yn,1579009019.0,"This is the one set up that has me a little fearful for Conor on Saturday. I’ve been watching fights from the two of them and while it appears Cerrone has slowed down a little in recent years, he still throws crafty kicks off of his right hand. We have seen throughout all of Conor’s career that the inside slip of a right hand to left cross  counter has been the money maker. I can’t shake the feeling that he may try to slip Cerrone’s right and find himself eating a headkick or having his leg punted. 


Who am I kidding. Mac in 3 minutes."

BoJackHorseman,fdrfvif,t1_fdr8fsi,1578683981.0,"This right here is why I don’t agree with the people who think Bojack will commit suicide or OD at the end of the season. All of these incremental lifestyle changes and lessons have been battered into his head over and over and over, and in season 6’s first half it appears he finally understands the gravity and power of living life well. I think that shit is definitely going to hit the fan between him and Hollyhock, but I think we will see the inner strength Bojack has been developing through sobriety and acceptance of self. 

Personally, I think Hollyhock will not be able to forgive Bojack for his actions. I do believe Bojack will end up taking a holistic approach and forgive himself."
MMA,fdqtghq,t1_fdpyxoy,1578674514.0,"I think the person you’re replying to meant more like “Gaethje got outclassed in that fight? What a joke” because Eddie left that cage with a golf ball on his face. He did win, but I wouldn’t say Gaethje got outclassed."
MMA,fdqt3rs,t3_emo4w6,1578674300.0,"If Khabib learned to punch with better technique he would be fucking unstoppable. A few times during this round his hands arguably looked faster than Conor’s, namely the jab, the two left hooks, and that one solid right that McGregor nodded at.  His athleticism is actually insane lol. 

This being said, champ shit only Tony will bodybag him."

AskMen,fdn8884,t3_elwlva,1578579928.0,"This happened back in highschool and it’s the first time I’ve ever had the sensation of my skin crawling, or a real cringe. So back in highschool there was this girl in my junior year physics class, we can call her Jasmine. During that year I had lunch right before physics, and there was a heavy marijuana culture at the school so I’d usually go out and spark during lunch, then come back nice and toasty for physics. 

After another day of business as usual I arrive to physics, and one thing I did in highschool was I was constantly hungry and asking others for food. I grew up poor and was at the time diving into physical fitness and kickboxing as an amateur, so I was consuming everything. Jasmine noticed this and shared some of her fruit snacks with me. Class ends and I head out, Jasmine is tailing me. 

I had known Jasmine had a little crush on me through a mutual friend of ours, so I entertained the convo while she walked me to my next class. Just before I go inside she goes “TheBigChimp, wait! Come here!” She grabs me by my shoulders, pulls me in, and says 

“If you’re still hungry, you could eat me hehe”

I turned around and went into English class. I’d never felt so uncomfortable in my fuckin life and I’ve had bones reset and have seen limbs tangled in ways they shouldn’t be. I still think about it quite often lol."

MMA,fdl16rq,t1_fdkuclj,1578515253.0,"It’s a possibility but he needs greater development. Every time I have watched Kevin he has the look of someone’s who has all the tools in the box, he’s just uncertain of which will suit him best in the moment at hand. He’s missing fluidity and definitive purpose in his movements. Watching the Gregor fight he certainly seems much calmer during the fight and much more focused on taking his man out of there which is the kind of development I wanted to see from his transition. 

Physically speaking he’s got it all going for him. I think he’s got the longest reach at lightweight, he’s got enough cardio to go 5, he’s got power, he can kick well enough, and he’s a killer on the mat. Kevin, to me, seems to be one of those fighters whose greatest fight is an internal one. Once he wins there it’ll be very, very difficult to beat him."
