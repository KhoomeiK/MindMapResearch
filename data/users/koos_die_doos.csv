specializedtools,ff8upov,t1_ff8iz2p,1579696735.0,"The ER wait times vary massively between cases, if triage says you’re a high priority there is no or very little waiting.

If you’re at the ER for a real emergency (not a standard cold/flu), our wait times are not terrible.

Calling an ambulance gets you through triage faster (shaving off maybe 30 minutes), after that you’re in the same lines as people who came in by themselves. So I don’t think what you heard has much merit.

Our ER sees a lot more people who needs non-emergency care. People with the flu who thinks a dr will make their symptoms go away. This inflates the average wait time massively, because they are treated last, and new cases get priority.

They also see more people who has a potentially serious issue with mild symptoms. Since it doesn’t cost the tax payer money, they are free to call an ambulance when they feel short of breath or are experiencing heart palpitations. Meaning that we catch more heart attacks early and more people get treatment sooner. Same goes for a variety of other issues.

Lastly some anecdotes. In the past 10 years me or someone in my family has been to the ER 5 times. 

-	my son needed stitches in his foot: 2 hours

You can find fault with this line of research by claiming it is easier to improve efficiency, but we know that companies are already building systems to be as efficient as possible within the customer's budget. If done cheaply enough, it could make a non-trivial difference.

Of course there is still theoretical limits on how much can be recovered, so I don't think it is the holy grail, but most of science is incremental, and this is an incremental step in the right direction."

The exact [tweet from Jim Bridenstine](https://twitter.com/JimBridenstine/status/1208021843388633090) was:

>Because [\#Starliner](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Starliner?src=hash)  believed it was in an orbital insertion burn (or that the burn was complete), the dead bands were reduced and the spacecraft burned more fuel than anticipated to maintain precise control. This precluded [@Space\_Station](https://twitter.com/Space_Station) rendezvous.

This is the important bit:

>the dead bands were reduced

Dead bands are used in performing attitude control (which way the craft is pointing), this graph might make it clearer:

When dead bands are reduced, more fuel is expended to point the craft in a more precise direction. When performing minor attitude adjustments in space, you expend an almost constant amount of fuel on each adjustment burn.

Simplified example of what should have happened: turn left, wait 5 seconds, turn right, wait 5 seconds, turn left, wait 5 seconds...

What actually happened: turn left, wait 0.5 seconds, turn right, wait 0.5 seconds, turn left...

So they ended up performing many more small attitude adjustment burns than required, and simply used up too much fuel to reach the proper orbit.

He even states:

>to maintain precise control

They didn't overshoot the orbit, they spent too much fuel keeping it pointed in the right direction."
space,fbh4ya6,t1_fbh3dow,1576865405.0,"Yup, if this was a crewed mission it would likely have been successful at reaching the intended orbit."
