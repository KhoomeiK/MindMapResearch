The key for the ants' success is taking the extremely powerful wasp genetic recipe and turning it into a economy version for the more controllable and resource-rich terrestial market (and then going back to the trees to claim those as well).

The last 100mln of insect evolution has been focused a lot about coming up with ways how to avoid, handle or exploit those pesky ants everywhere."

The term 'hibernation' is just a colloquial and inaccurate description of the scientific term 'diapause'. It really means 'halt of development caused by unfavourable conditions'. This doesn't necessarily mean cold (though that is the most common one), but can also mean too much heat or lack of food or water (less common among ants). These all also have their own names but I don't remember them from the top of my head and I don't feel like going through Borror&DeLong right now.

LittleByBlue was already pretty on spot, so I'll only add some more notes:

\- the fact the setup still gets 12 degrees at day (which means the ants probably still get higher than 8 degrees, means they won't go into full torpor and brood will still slowly develop. Usually in nature these are late-autumn temperatures and at that point the colony won't make new brood but will try to finish as much late-stage with current food reserves before it gets too cold.

\- while they won't eat (and if well-fed have reserves well past even 6 months of full hibernation), they do need to keep an eye out of dehydration. I don't know the exact lowest limit, but even at 5 degrees Lasius niger can still emergency move out of a dried out testtube to a close by fresh test tube.

\- don't mind the mold. Terrestial ants are very well-equipped to deal with harmful bacteria and fungi. Only when it's of a yellow kind keep an eye out when you warm up the tube (these are often yeast-like bacteria and can cause overpressure in the waterreservoir causing it leak once you take them out of the fridge), or when it's a black dry-looking 'cap' on the cotton as this can prevent moisture evaporation (Tetramorium are very sensitive to this one).

\- your colony is still in it's first year. Hibernation then is much less important. So you can choose to take them out whenever you feel like and just give them an early 'spring', keeping them at your room temperature."
antkeeping,fdqg2y2,t1_fdq9icx,1578665776.0,"Don't trust the information on [antstore.net](https://antstore.net) too much. Hans Kalytta was the ant expert at that place and since he left they've just been copy pasting his old information across other 'similar' species. Martin Sebesta has... 'other priorities'. 

And bear in mind that, yes, for many ant keepers the colony will more likely be just a matter of hundreds for a long period as their circumstances and care won't surpass 'acceptable' and most Camponotus species need additional stimuli like proper hibernation, seasonal climate variations and other less tangible stuff to achieve max growth.

Personally I rarely keep colonies past a certain size because it's not practical (I already have a few hundred colonies to care for), and I'm also not a big fan of Camponotus (bit too straightforward and boring for my personal taste).

So as for pictures. I'd say just google for 'huge' Camponotus colonies to get an idea (especially C.nicobarensis as that one is, somewhat comparable in ant size, but is a faster grower and many people have huge colonies of them)."
antkeeping,fdq77t3,t3_empiwh,1578657818.0,"I have them both. They both rquire the typical standard exotic Camponotus treatment. They like some warmth but nothing crazy (so 25-27 is just fine), so offer them a heat gradient (read: only warm a part of the nest and see how they like it first).

The size if they are really happy about their environment and food will be a few thousand at two years. requiring probably two large ytong nests (they do very well in ytong once they have enough majors running around and a permanent water source in their outworld). At this point the will also require a decent sized tank for an outworld.

If the circumstances aren't perfect but still good enough for them, then you'll be just up to a thousand or so at that point (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as unexperienced ant-keepers are generally easily overwhelmed by the requirements of adult-sized colonies)."

antkeeping,fcnerr7,t3_ei4iw5,1577810226.0,"A mention of the actual species involved would have been useful. But anyway, species that live in areas where there the top of the soil can freeze during winter, typically hibernate between 3 and 8 degrees C (that's 37 to 46 in stupid Fahrenheit).

You can keep them in a fridge, just keep them away from the back wall. A for suffocation, cotton plugs are air permeable enough for ants in a testtube as long as it's not too many of them and they aren't hysterically running around. With the lowered metabolism of hibernation however, that amount of air is many times the amount necessary to keep a small colony alive during the hibernation months."

Entomology,fc61t5m,t3_egbzhq,1577470344.0,"Castes are a bit of a vague term, even scientifically, but the most commonly applied way is looking at actual roles combined with morphology. Most species use the minor, medium and major system with then on top supermajors (for when majors surpass the morphological features of the queen (typically head width).

For many of these species the majors and supermajors act as repletes (like Messor and Carebara) but other genera have an actual replete class like Myrmecocystus, or a genus like Prenolepis where all workers can act like replete if they chose to.

Soldiers is a term that's often misapplied to any larger ant of the major cast, but in reality ants have very few actual 'soldiers' whose role is solely guard duty/combat. The sickle-mandibled Cataglyphis bombycina is one of the rare exceptions, but then again you also have Colobobsis with their plug-shaped heads acting like doormen but these are usually referred to as just majors.

But then there are also fungi growing ant colonies with different cast for all the different responsibilites like cutting the leaves, transporting them to depots, cutting the leaves smaller and bringing them to the nest, chewing the bits into pulp and sticking it onto the scaffolds using fecal matter, seeding fungi bulbs onto the fresh areas and finally caring and harvesting the two different fungi 'edibles' and feeding them to the workers or brood. Atta has 7 different recognized castes for all of this.

And there are also the slave-keeping species like Polyergus and that keep workers of a different species (or in case of Strongylognathus even the queen) subjugated to do most of the heavy lifting.

But things get really complicated once you get to reproduction. You've got normal queens, ergatoid queens ('like a worker' meaning wingless) as a backup/supportive queen or in cases like some Crematogasters more acting like a  replete/cannery, storing excess proteins and then turning them into mass-produced unfertilized trophic eggs.

Some species like Leptomyrmex or some Anochetes they have simple gotten rid of their winged queens alltogether in favor of cheaper ergatoids either mating in their parental nest, or doing nuptials on foot. Other species like Cardiocondyla instead made all their males ergatoids and those then compete with another inside the nest to mate with available unmated queens.

For the 'less advanced' poneramorphs most species also have gamergates, as most of their workers have reduced but still well- functioning reproductive organs, so they can mate with males encountered while foraging and support or replace their queen if necessary.

Some species, again, decided they could do without the queen caste and found gamergates were sufficient like the queenless dinoponera.

But then there is also the Diacamma where all ants can get castrated at birth of special hormonal glands to then either become a sterile worker or a mated queen (people often say Diacamma has gamergates, but that's not entirely accurate as the gemmae glands evolved from wing structures, making the ant when she ecloses technically an unmated ergatoid queen).

Ofcourse in polygynous colonies the queens are often ranked with dominant ones doing most of the eggproduction, and submissive ones, sometimes purposefully not mated to produce the males (some Pheidole). Or in case of a poor nuptial flight the umated queens can drop their wings and simply start working like normal majors as can be seen with Pheidole.

So where is the line what's a different caste or not? I think even entomologists find the lines rather blurry when it comes to ants as a whole."
