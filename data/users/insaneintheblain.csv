HighStrangeness,ffawb0j,t1_ffavrmp,1579745980.0,"Can you name a thing you have no concept of? 

We have a store - an inventory of 'symbols' we use to understand the world. We can grow this store. And we can share symbols so that we can communicate. 

We're talking about reality - reality and consciousness are the same thing. The source of reality - everyone's reality - is these symbols. From these, our entire experience is elaborated - filled in - by the brain. 

But really, all the brain is doing is pattern matching."

spirituality,ffavfqv,t3_esd56n,1579745408.0,"It's important to understand what the Ego actually is - what role it plays in the psyche. Accepting yourself demands that you first know yourself.   


But what you think you are isn't actually what you are.   


The role of Ego is to generate a 'Persona' - the cultural mask we wear and identify with - built entirely through reactions to the world.   


We are taught from a very young age that this mask is who we are. And so we spend a lot of time on defining who we are - instead of finding out who we are.   


Wisdom begins with the simple maxim: ""*Know thyself*"".   


You cannot know yourself without transcending Ego.   


Transcending Ego isn't about avoidance. Instead, it is about what Carl Jung calls ""confronting the shadow"" - that invisible unconscious part we each carry around which determines a great part of how we live and interface with others.   


""Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate."" - Carl Jung"

We live in a world run by the Tyranny of the masses. They are not aware of how their actions or why their actions impact the larger group of which they are part.   


The world is divided into a majority of unaware puppets, forever looking to authority and entertainment/the fulfilment of desire and those who have managed to move past this and salvage some modicum of Self-agency.   


We need to stop falling for the fallacy of groups. There is no social ideology that can overcome the human shadow - at least not without serious consequences.

First things first. You need to get rid of this victim mentality. It isn't helping you. As Psychologist Carl Jung said, ""I am not what happened to me, I am what I choose to become.”

Approach it from this vantage point. You alone have control of your wellbeing. You must acknowledge that part of you - that hurt child inside - and you must confront your demons.

It's not easy. You will find yourself making excuses - because your mind doesn't want to confront these things - it wants to protect you from them, by repressing them, but it doesn't realise how much harm this is causing you.

If you can, speak to a counsellor - if possible, a Jungian counsellor.  They will help you understand what is happening in a clearer way than you can alone.
