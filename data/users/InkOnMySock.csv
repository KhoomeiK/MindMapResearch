AskReddit,fecsarz,t1_fecf7vw,1578982707.0,I like the idea of getting a motorcycle and I know I would love it in a safe way( I would not have been safe If iI was 22 or below). I will never get one because I don't trust anyone on the road. I have enough hobbies that fulfill that void. Everyone has that person they knew who got a crotch rocket motorcycle right after high school and either killed or maimed themselves a shortly after.
AskReddit,fecr8we,t1_fecf29n,1578981622.0,"I thought I wanted to be a nurse for a while, I got a job as a medical assistant and realized I didn't want to work 12 hours shifts. I'm grateful I took that job before I decided to go back to school. I was great at being a medical assistant and I know I would be a stellar nurse or doctor. The work would be fulfilling and interesting but It wouldn't allow me to live the lifestyle I want to live in."

skiing,fctgkpd,t3_ei6d3t,1577942585.0,Hunter is one of the most hilarious mountains I've ever skied. The NYC crowd can get rowdy with so many egos and such long lines. Great little mountain when it's not a complete solid sheet of certified ice.
