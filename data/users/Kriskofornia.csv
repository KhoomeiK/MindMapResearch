bipolar,fehq1j2,t3_ep34zt,1579121592.0,"I struggle with this same thing. Even my girlfriend says she misses the old me. It really just feels like Bipolar folks were dealt a shit hand, and science is like, “maybe try this pill?”. 

Worst part is now that I’m “stable” my psychiatrist doesn’t want to take the time to talk to me about med adjustments."
bipolar,fdzzo5o,t3_eng9ha,1578799610.0,YUM!
