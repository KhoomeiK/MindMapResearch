On the one hand, I do think that the fact that cannabis is prohibited dissuades well adjusted, successful people from partaking. 

On the other hand, I think that well adjusted, successful people are less likely to use drugs, including alcohol, than people who aren’t well adjusted. I also think that whatever the forces that shaped stoner culture may be, that stoner culture runs deep, and that changing laws doesn’t rapidly change or erase stoner culture."

I think Trump almost had it, but got it backwards. It isn't that weed smoking makes you dumb, its that being dumb makes you smoke weed.  On average, I can't fucking stand stoners. My experience with them has been that they're lazy and unkempt. Basically, the slacker stereotype has held. Think Shaggy Rogers. Am I that much of a dick that I wouldn't want to be around Shaggy Rogers? Maybe I am a dick. But I can personally tell you its a huge pain in the ass to have a Shaggy Rogers ass person as your coworker, or to have to depend on them for literally anything important.

Years ago, I worked for animal control in a rural area to get by while I was waiting to start grad school. Can you imagine how much it fucking sucks trying to capture frequently dangerous animals with Bongman McDoobie as your partner? Because, let me tell you, it fucking sucks. Nice guy. He really was. Also a complete airhead, and not even close to the sort of person I want as backup when I'm trying to get rattlesnakes out of a crawlspace.

That said, I realize that smoking weed doesn't automatically turn you in to a blathering Shaggy Rogersian fuckhead. Instead, its more likely that the sort of people that present as Shaggy Rogersian fuckheads are drawn to smoking pot/more open to making it known they smoke pot/less able to be discrete about smoking pot. They were a dull, unreliable person before the doobie. Smoking the doobie just exacerbated the problem."

She could have even tried again this time if she wanted to. She’s savvy enough to know that it wouldn’t have been a good look for her, but she could have. She didn’t. 

If she really gave a flying fuck about this country, or anything beyond her ego (it’s years later and she’s still blaming everyone but herself for fucking up being practically handed the Presidency on a silver platter), she wouldn’t be taking pot shots at a candidate who very well may be the nominee. Surely she understands how important it is that Trump is ousted this election. To do that, we want party unity, not discord. 

Of course, whether or not Trump is beaten doesn’t *really* matter to Hillary Clinton. At least, it isn’t her primary concern. After all, she’s a rich white lady. Sure the poors and browns might suffer, but she’ll personally be just fine. What matters to Hillary Clinton is her ego and her legacy. It must be torture for her to think that Bernie Sanders may succeed where she failed. To know that the way she played the game is way past it’s best-by date. The Clinton Era is over, and it ended on a low note. Bernie winning even means that she will be denied so much as an in for influence in the White House. Kamala was her girl. So is Warren. She could have lived with one of them because then she could tell herself that even though she failed her spiritual successor did and that Clintonian influence lives on.

Their ideas, however, are popular. What they need are charismatic leaders who can tie these popular ideas to left parties and gain support. 

Which, yeah I know that she is doing the pragmatic thing by running in an established party because, yes, you actually want to maximize your chances at winning elections. On the other hand, how she is framing the issue sort of chaps my ass. 

In principle, I have more in common with AOC than with a Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg. But the fact that the democrats are a center-right party isn’t an issue. There are a lot of center-right people in the US, and having a party that represents their interests isn’t a bad thing. 

To me, the best solution to not having a nationally competitive party that represents progressives is to make a progressive party nationally competitive, yeah? I understand it’s less difficult as a matter of practice to run a progressive platform in a center right party in the US system than to make a progressive party nationally competitive. I get that. But it feels sleazy to me to sell that tactical decision by framing Democrats as not far enough to the left. And even if I don’t agree with their politics, I can see where a center right democrat voter would be irritated by the implication.

Because I don’t think the two prominent party model is going to go away any time soon in the US, what I see happening in the future is the GOP collapsing and needing to come back to reality in order to survive. Demographic changes are coming, and the GOP is living on borrowed time. Either the GOP makes a big move toward the center, or it ceases to matter on a national level. 

At that point, I think you see a center right GOP that can get votes from center right voters, leaving the Democrat party to progressives, or you see ex GOP voters moving to the democrat party and a progressive alternative party rising to national prominence.

And I think that happens relatively soon. Like, is Texas even going to be red in 10 years? Once that flip happens, it’s over for the GOP nationally. What I’d like to see in the mean time is for charismatic progressives like AOC to be positioning themselves as the public face of a bonafide progressive party like DSA rather than embedding themselves in a center right party that they’ll probably never have meaningful command but in."

For example, you can bust your hump at McDonalds and still be an associate manager making shit wages in 5 years. Alternatively, you could expend some of your efforts on building a business. Basically, the goal shouldn’t be to work more (time wise). The goal should be to work hard in order to make your hours more valuable.

Pritzker, has decided to issue pardons to persons who had been convicted of minor cannabis related crimes so that they might expunge convictions from their records that affect their ability to get a job or advance within their field. As you might be aware, minorities have historically been disproportionately likely to be arrested and convicted of drug related offenses despite similar usage rates compared to white people. Minorities also heavily skew democrat.

Per your criteria, even if Governor Pritzker didn't even know you existed prior to seeing your name on a pardon list, if you've so much as volunteered 20 years ago to help pass out fliers for a mayoral candidate in the same party as Pritzker, he shouldn't pardon you.

That sounds like an awful, onerous standard.

Having an independent pardon review committee (Illinois does) is enough. Allowing other people to decide whether or not a petitioner should be pardoned helps ensure a non-political, merit-based process."

* No pardoning people you've bumped uglies with.
* No pardoning relatives closer than fourth cousins.
* No pardoning people you've regularly associated with professionally or personally. 

Honestly a better approach would be to just have an independent pardon committee make a list of recommendations for pardons every year for the President to review. POTUS doesn't have any input on the list or influence over the committee, but is free to pardon or not pardon anybody on it once it reaches his desk."

But then the pardon ceases to be a pardon, no? It effectively just becomes commutation to probation for life. Why not just do pardons through a relief committee? That is, convicted persons submit a pardon petition to committee. Committee reviews applications, if it feels a petitioner deserves a pardon, it puts them on a list of petitioners they recommend to pardon. Recommendations get sent to the President annually. President may or may not pardon people from that list."

Because throwing money at the nominal problem doesn’t always help. That is, if the immediate concern is school, tossing money at the school may be a bad solution. Just my perspective, but a well funded school isn’t going to help if you live in a dirt poor community. Like, it’s cool that there are new books and a nice computer lab. But I’m not going to be in much of a mood for learning if that is the one area of my life where things are in order. Pretend you’re a 14 year old girl in East St. Louis. You’ve never known your biological father, and the closest thing you’ve had to a stable male role model in your life, one of your mothers live in boyfriends, ended up molesting you. Your mother is barely around, and encourages you to get pregnant in order to receive benefits. In her absence, you are responsible for taking care of your siblings which means you don’t really have time to work a job. You’ve been told that educating yourself will lead to a better life, but you look around your community and don’t see anybody that has worked out for. Besides, even if you could, it’s not like you can just pick up and leave your family. You’re hungry. Like, always hungry. Your mother and her latest boyfriend just finished trading the remaining balance on the LINK card for booze money, so that’s out. Homework and studying is absolutely your last priority. Your school just got some new computers though, so that’s good.

Yes, schools should have adequate funding. But it also seems obvious to me that a poorly funded school stems from a district that is unable to adequately fund their schools, and indicates deep problems that need addressed. I expect along with a poorly funded school you will also find high unemployment, a lack of professional opportunity, high rates of crime and substance abuse, etc. fixing those things are at least as important as funding schools if the goal is improving educational outcomes."

The Articles have been voted on, and it’s a matter of public record. Anybody with an internet connection can read them any time they want. Strictly speaking, there is nothing stopping the senate from saying they will proceed with what is publicly available instead of waiting for a house member to physically present a copy to the senate.

Probable is another story. Being that every democrat in the senate is going to vote against that, it means that pretty much all republicans need to be on board for what is transparently tossing norms to rush for an acquittal.

Graham’s suggested play, if I understand him, is changing senate rules so that the formality of house members presenting articles is not required. The rules were formed at a time before the internet, and the articles as they are written are public record. Thus, no need to have a House messenger present them to the senate. They could simply get a copy themselves and go from there.

They could also change the rules to say that once the Senate has initiated the trial process, that the house may send impeachment managers. If they fail to do so after X days, the trial will proceed without them."

Explain to me why you think pursuing additional impeachment articles isn’t a poor use of resources. Alternatively, do you have reason to believe that this time will be different?

It’s become pretty clear that Trump voters don’t give a flying fuck about what Trump does. Wasting more time on impeachment articles that will never reach the senate floor isn’t going to sway them, it’s going to galvanize them and allow Trump to scream at every rally about being persecuted. It’s going to make him double down again on making stupid fucking distractions that harm our standing in the world. 

So, no, I don’t feel like chasing windmills. We’ve got a fucking election coming up where we need to win not just the presidency, but try to take the senate. I’m more worried about that than I am trying to get the half hearted handjob of impeachment without removal, and I’d rather the messaging focused on Moscow Mitch and the dunce judges he’s stacking the courts with than how impeachment maybe might work with one weird trick."
