But you fucked this kid for life, his whole passion was not only made fun of but used against him and crippled him. He can’t have anything near a normal life now, he can’t walk on the beach with loved ones, can’t enter certain buildings, maybe he doesn’t have any feeling in his lower half, can feel pleasure or have any sort of control of his bladder.

pcmasterrace,fcrg4q9,t1_fcpfrkv,1577901376.0,Did notice that until you mentioned it. Can you imagine how much bank you can make with a Millennium Falcon graphics card?
pcmasterrace,fcrfwdv,t1_fcpoag5,1577901291.0,"Thanks. The case has some massive Jank to it so some of the peel  is tucked in, and Iâ€™ve had first and experienced to know that the whole system might move if slowly pull it so a quick flick o da wrist will snap the plastic."
pcmasterrace,fcrfi2u,t1_fcr1n49,1577901145.0,"I was in the same boat, it was fine but it was running like crap after the operation update, ran tf2 and some other old titles ok so it was serviceable.

 I got lucky with my build. The MoBo, CPU, Cooler, graphics card, and the power supply was from by cousins old build so I bought it for a cheap price. But waiting is ok, as long as itâ€™s for a good deal."
pcmasterrace,fcrescm,t1_fcr5n2o,1577900861.0,Peels are ok but nothing compares to that feeling when your PC posts. This was my first time building one so you can imagine my anxiety during instillation

confession,fcbt5c3,t3_egtp3e,1577590682.0,"Jeez, I mean bullies can mess you up psychologically for quite some time but you can heal and get help. Physical pain lasts even shorter with bruises going away and scars fading. 

But you fucked this kid for life, his whole passion was not only made fun of but used against him and crippled him. He canâ€™t have anything near a normal life now, he canâ€™t walk on the beach with loved ones, canâ€™t enter certain buildings, maybe he doesnâ€™t have any feeling in his lower half, can feel pleasure or have any sort of control of his bladder. 

Your punishment should be to continue knowing how badly you screwed him and that it can never be forgiven."
