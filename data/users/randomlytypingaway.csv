dogs,ffnh0t0,t3_eua6mr,1580065859.0,"I have had a total of 3 great danes (2 right now) and I have never had 1 person ask if they bite or act if I were irresponsible.  That would piss me off.  If I thought I could not control my dog, I would not bring my dog to public places like a home depot, etc.

I've had a shy dane that needed to have proper introductions (sniffing, etc), so I've had to set expectations when people ask to pet, but man I'd be so mad if someone assumed that because they were big that they would bite.

Some people are afraid of dogs in general and you cna tell so I try to keep them away so as not to bug! 

However, I'm very happy that your dog helped set a good example!  We used to have a pittie, and she set such a great example for the breed... In fact 2 people that we knew decided to adopt a pit bull for their families because of the example our dog made (Sweet, kind and extra loving).  Of course all dogs have the capability to be aggressive in the wrong environment, so great job at giving your leonbeger the chance the flourish in your care!"

puppy101,ffjk9gd,t3_etygfy,1580000143.0,When my pup is napping in the room with me I take her in the kennel and just get her comfortable and let her nap in there.  That might require me sitting on the floor.  Then I close it when she is calm and will dtya on the floor next to the kennel until she falls asleep again and then will move to a chair and watch TV as she naps.  She seems to do well with that and it is making that area feel like a safe spot.

Dogtraining,ff2gz8m,t3_er6zst,1579505713.0,"My great dane that passed away last year was leash reactive and also fences and other dogs made him react ""aggressively"" as well.  However, if he was off leash he was perfectly fine and friendly and never got Ina dog fight.  We kenneled him at a place that let all the dogs have free run of the house with all other dogs and he loved it there.

It might not be an aggression issue, but some sort of leash reactivatety issue, from what you are describing.  I tried working with our dane, but note a lot can stem from you if you are anticipating it and your nervous.  Because he was 140lbs I felt I was always on edge which made his reactivity worse.  When I did training sessions and they got me to be less tense he did much better.  He also typically did better with my husband.  I would definitely work with a trainer that specializes in reactivity!"

Dogtraining,fea6ivx,t3_eo5z8s,1578944919.0,"My great dane used to be very very weary of strangers (we got him at 8 weeks so that was just his personality, he didn't even want to interact with us when we met him before taking him home). 

When we started socialization the first strangers took about 30 minutes to an hour for him to get comfortable.  Then it slowly went down to 15 minutes to 10 then to 5, and now he can get comfortable with strangers in a matter of minutes.  However it is a very specific way of meeting people that allows him to realize they are not threats and then he is wanting to play play play (your dog may not want to play with strangers, but just being alright).

What works for our dog is for people to just ignore him. He will bark at first if you are coming into the house, but then we wants to sniff.  We have people not pet him immediately and let him sniff, and we tell them to just ignore him and not talk to him.  Then, after ample sniffing time, he will get into play mode (but he is still scared if you play too much with him).  However, we can have parties now and he will not be anxious and will be interacting with everyone.  You can use food too (I usually do that if it's a stanger at a pet store that is a one time interaction), and I tend to make sure that he sees me touching the person and having good interactions with them as well. 

The only exception is the vet... No amount of positive reinforcement has been able to get him to be okay with people at the vet.  I think he just associated them at such a young age with poking and prodding and is not okay with that. 

Keep it positive, don't let people try to pet your dog until ready (and with smaller dogs people are more likely going to want to do that)!  You are your pets advocate and protector so make sure you do what you can to make each interaction good! 

It might not be that he will like that person, but may no longer see them as a threat!

Sounds like your pup will settle after a while based on what you said, so I think that just working with them as you have been (but very consistently), you cna turn it around.  I would even try to schedule people to come over (like friends) for just this reason so you can help have control over the environment (making sure things  aren't too loud as they are meeting, having high value treats ready, etc)."

remotework,fdkvoca,t3_elur4k,1578512114.0,"The two companies that I have work at home for have been relatively easy to negotiate.  Essentially I feel like you set this up through being reliable and a valuable member of the team.  For me, I was moving out of state both times and they did not want to lose a valued employee who they know works hard. 

My suggestion is that if you are new at a company, but want to try to work at home eventually, ensure that you set yourself as an employee that stands out for their hard work and dedication.  That will help alleviate the doubt in productivity that they may have (maybe not all, but if they agree to you working from home you can certainly prove no productivity loss)"
