He regularly yelled at me over little things, to the point where my ears would ring. CPS was called once, and after they left, he yelled at me more.

He carved for himself a 4 foot long stick from hardwood to threaten me with.

He forced me to throw away all of my Thomas the Train toys after I played with them for 5 minutes longer than he thought I should.

From 1st to 4th grade, I fell asleep crying most nights.

In 6th grade, I forged so many parent signatures because if I didn't get an A on everything, I was yelled at for an hour.

In 7th and 8th grade, I contemplated suicide because after telling him that the teachers would do nothing about a bully I had, he told me to suck it up and be a man.
