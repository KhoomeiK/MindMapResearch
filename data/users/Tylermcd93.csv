pics,ffe2fvw,t1_ffe2d9s,1579834950.0,Maybe you’re right. It really didn’t taste undercooked but I was probably too quick.
pics,ffe1d4o,t1_ffe0nsc,1579834165.0,It was cooked all the way through.
pics,ffe1b05,t1_ffe14a0,1579834123.0,"No it was, this was the only part that’s super pink like this, and it seems to be from whatever the stringy thing is. The chicken was cooked thoroughly."

pics,ffe148m,t1_ffe04u6,1579833986.0,"I mean not necessarily. Idk what it is, but that doesn’t mean it’s inherently harmful. Like some people have said, could be a myoglobin, a vein, a ligament, etc. My mind went to the worst possible option but that’s more just paranoia and I’ll admit that."
pics,ffe0yi6,t1_ffe0g54,1579833869.0,"It was pretty cooked, that’s the only pink part and my guess is that it’s because of the stringy thing. It also didn’t taste undercooked."
pics,ffe02oy,t1_ffdztw6,1579833229.0,It was cooked thoroughly but I’m just worried about a possible parasite. First time I’ve seen this in any chicken I’ve eaten.
pics,ffdzziz,t1_ffdztya,1579833166.0,"Probably true but things like tapeworms or something have eggs in them, so cutting through them can be an issue."
pics,ffdzvpq,t1_ffdztjj,1579833089.0,Yeah it was fully cooked. I was worried it was like a parasite or something
pics,ffdzu5l,t1_ffdzqa5,1579833058.0,Hopefully. I’m just worried it could be a tapeworm or something.
pics,ffdzsl5,t1_ffdznpf,1579833026.0,Yeah it looks gross. The rest of the chicken tasted good though.
pics,ffdzrg9,t1_ffdzlrj,1579833003.0,"It was a thin chicken breast, frozen, I thawed it and cooked it for about 15 to 17 minutes. It tasted real good but I noticed this and gross thoughts came, like a tapeworm or something."

He just doesn’t believe in what archeologists report as they have virtually no actual way of know how they behaved or may have looked or sounded, etc etc. I ask what about the bones, he believes that they are all fake, or at least a lot of them are likely from the same animal.

todayilearned,fem2rm0,t1_felxsu0,1579237847.0,I don’t see why the invention of either of these things needed to kill the ability for public transport across great distances that isn’t a bus and was much faster than said automobiles.
todayilearned,felojoy,t1_fellw3o,1579227123.0,Remember when the US used to actually have cross country passenger trains and they GOT RID OF IT....FOR SOME REASON???
movies,fekk1ik,t3_epmxxj,1579201673.0,I greatly agree. I personally thought the first three movies were a great trilogy imo. The 3rd is a tad long but still greatly enjoyable.
NLSSCircleJerk,fekjsrs,t1_fekgj6b,1579201527.0,"I was thinking the same, but Austin became a regular well before then. Like around 2015ish. Idk if that was it. Imo, it was due to world events. Nick was especially affected when Trump won the election in America and since then, politics seeped into the show, jokes or not. It kinda tainted it for me personally. It became more bitter, less fun to listen to, and that also kinda became a focus regarding the games they played. Nick was always fairly light on the harsh criticism of the games they played but at a certain point the show kinda didn’t pull punches when they disliked a new game, and that probably didn’t sit well with Nick because he often considers the developers and the possibility that they were watching during their shows. At least, this was my observation, doesn’t mean it’s correct."

I deeply regret how I treated her and I turned my new leaf regarding her when I was 16 or 17, but it was too late. She has stayed distant from me when I wish we were closer and are there for each other. But she hates me. And I love her so much and regret what I’ve done so much.

Please, please I beg of you. Treat your sister kindly. Protect her and have her back. She’s the only one you have (I assume). Apologize to her for all that you may have done to her in your life and stand by her like a brother should, like I should have."
NoStupidQuestions,fejdfyq,t3_epgt7f,1579168595.0,"Well, the loud bang part yes I think of gun. But I don’t have an underlying fear of being shot. Even in the worst of areas, you’re more likely to get in a car accident than be shot randomly. Most gun violence is personal. Those shootings, while tragic, are not a norm across the entire country. It’s still very irregular. Just remember who reports on it. The media tend to take things in unnecessary directions and extremes with this kind of stuff, especially foreign media."
Showerthoughts,fejdako,t3_epgw3h,1579168364.0,Actually true. Usually much more subtly and more interestingly. Adult movies just say the punchline and that’s it.

writing,feitclf,t3_epcskg,1579146686.0,"Tropes are tropes for a reason. They work. They make sense. Often times when people try to stay away from tropes, it usually ends up being messy or inconsistent. It’s okay to try to think of original concepts but people should stop looking down on tropes and just enjoy entertainment for what it is.
