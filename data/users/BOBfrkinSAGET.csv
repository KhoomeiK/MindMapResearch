They are also not shot to be killed, but shot to be wounded. She admits that Palestine commits acts of terror against Israel, but feels that it makes sense considering the position they are put in. Those are really the main points I remember. 

Interestingly enough, I was at a bar a week or two after I saw this, and the people I was sitting next to had really strong accents, so I asked them where they were from. Turns out they were from Israel. I talk to them for a while about their story, when they moved to America, what they thought about it, stuff like that. They asked me about my story, where I’m from, all that. Very cool people. So with this new information fresh in my mind, I decided to tell him about the podcast, what I heard and if any of it is true. As I was talking about it, I could see his body language change to be very uncomfortable and almost sad.

At the end of the shift one night, 3 or 4 people came in and pulled garbage bag sized bags from other department stores and started filling them up. One of them took one of our mesh totes and started filling that. I donâ€™t remember the rule exactly, but something about the fact that you could see the items through the mesh bag made it so you could stop them or something. As they are walking out with huge bags full of shit, the dude leaves the mesh bag full of clothes on the floor. Fucking infuriating."
