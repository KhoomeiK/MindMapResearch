DDLC,ffw0gpb,t3_ekzhsb,1580279278.0,"Here's some constructive criticism:

While the body shape, textures, colours and hands are brilliant, this piece of artwork falls into the uncanny valley. Due to the realistic face and anime body, it looks bizarre, as if it was a doll. However, some art works look great with more realistic eyes, such as Korean cartoons (manhwa, like manga). What I'm thinking is that you should look at these comics and experiment with the style, see what works and don't works. Overall, this is a great piece."
