TrueOffMyChest,ff75ujg,t3_es095s,1579641719.0,"It’s not silly, I’ve been here as well. For me, writing a suicide letter helped me work through some things. Like you, I didn’t want to do it afterwards. I kept going and eventually I met someone new and now we’re starting a family!! Things still get really hard and I still have those thoughts but I’m always happy I pushed through. 

Life is hard but you’re amazing and the world wouldn’t be the same without you. I know you don’t want any DMs but if you ever need someone to talk to, if even about cheezit flavors, I’m your girl. You’re not alone <3333"

stories,ff6mwgm,t1_ff5r9pv,1579630602.0,Thanks for adding this. I'm terrified as is but it seems like the only stories/experiences I can find are the traumatic ones.

relationship_advice,felplx9,t3_epta1x,1579227854.0,bro wtf it’s just a cold sore/fever blister/whatever you want to call it. I imagine the weather is either changing constantly or cold all the time... there’s nothing wrong. it happens. leave her aloneeee
relationship_advice,felp3ly,t3_eptqq7,1579227502.0,you do nothing... she’s engaged. worry about work at work and move on otherwise.
TrueOffMyChest,feldvb5,t3_epftck,1579219866.0,a lot of these aren’t even problems and can be changed in the settings... it’s just not that deep mate

lgbt,fekinal,t1_fekht2p,1579200834.0,yeah except you're missing the point where no one invalidated non-dysphoric transgender. the kid said he identifies as these things for **fun**.... which is completely different and rather insulting.... dear lord.
TrueOffMyChest,fekguid,t3_epm185,1579199766.0,"Just be verrrry careful :) More often than not, the ""oh my mistake"" isn't going to suffice. Especially if you frequent the same store, inventory will tell them it's more than an oversight. Best of luck though, OP!"
TrueOffMyChest,fekg66a,t1_fekfbr4,1579199358.0,"you're just begging for an argument... did I ever say anything about dysphoria? YOU LITERALLY SAID YOU CHOOSE TO 'IDENTIFY' AS THOSE THINGS FOR THE 'FUN' OF IT.... AND THAT IS NOT VALID IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM... you are a troll. move along, kid."
TrueOffMyChest,fekf3iw,t1_fekehvb,1579198718.0,"you can be non-binary ‘for fun’ but not trans or autistic... this is why you’re a troll. quit mocking the ones who truly have no choice but to live with these everyday, you are a disgrace."

TrueOffMyChest,fck7gtc,t3_ehn4by,1577718709.0,"I would help her get help. There are a lot of things that can come with having a baby like postpartum depression and whatnot. She may be experiencing something like that and not know how to process it herself. Especially if she hasn’t always been like this, help her get to the bottom of it. Good luck friend :)"
TrueOffMyChest,fcg1rk3,t3_eh7h05,1577635713.0,"Makes perfect sense. I can relate in a lot of ways. Sometimes I even mash up words when my tongue gets ‘tangled’ and just stop talking. Keep at it, friend <3"

confessions,fc6p69b,t1_fc6oot3,1577485975.0,"I truly don’t mean to come off as harsh. it’s perfectly alright, I definitely had some of those feelings growing up too with 2 younger sisters. sometimes we all need an outside opinion to help us see clearer. you’re doing great, op, keep trekking <3"
confessions,fc6okyj,t3_eghrww,1577485552.0,"I understand your frustrations but you have to not look at her as taking things ‘from’ you. A ukulele and a chicken are both rather inexpensive. A piano and a computer are not. I’m sure they plan on throwing you a quinceanera, which is a big expense even if they plan on making the food themselves and throwing it at home. It’s not all about you, and your parents just seem like they’re trying to make your sister not feel left out. Relax and trust that your parents are doing their best to give you both all you want."
confessions,fc6np6j,t3_eghni9,1577484927.0,"hey, don’t lose all hope or sell yourself short. I think you’ll meet a girl who understands and will work with you to help. and who knows, maybe you need more than physical attraction. maybe it won’t last forever. there’s always a way my dude!"

confessions,fc6kljb,t3_eggtw9,1577482795.0,"It’s alright if you don’t know her, I would just relay it to her in a helpful manner. Maybe say something like “hey I notice people call you Ebete and I’m not sure if you know but it means stupid in Italian.” You’re really nice for wanting to help a girl out, I’m sure she’ll see it the same way. Good luck!"
