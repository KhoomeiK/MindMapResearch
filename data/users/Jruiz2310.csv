OCPoetry,fcrivsj,t3_eii7j7,1577902403.0,"I can’t be the only one who feels alone

I’m a stranger inside my home

Evil thoughts, they always roam

Cut my wrist till I see the bone

Tortured soul, I’m so abused

Racing thoughts, remain confused

This game of life, I’ll always lose

Kill you or me, can’t seem to choose

Forgot the feeling, it’s been a while

Will someone teach me how to smile

I still feel like I’m a child

This thing called life is a pedophile

Look in the mirror, stare in my eyes

I’m the one who caused my demise

I’m psychotic, there’s no surprise 

I hate you all, your love was lies

God left us, no point to pray

The devil says he came to play

For your safety, please stay away

I’ll kill myself another day"

Anxiety,fck0un5,t3_ehl6dj,1577713083.0,"I remember one time a few years ago. I woke up in the middle of the night. Me still being half asleep, I saw a shadowy figure at the end of my bed. I sat up and once the shadow figure moved towards me I felt I couldn’t move at all. Then it reached out with it’s left arm to grab my neck. The moment it did, I felt like I could not breathe. Then it slowly faded away, and I was back to normal but confused about what just happened. This only happened once, but I’m still confused on what happened that night."

SuicideWatch,fcioftp,t3_ehe17t,1577666094.0,"I’ve been to a mental hospital for suicidal thoughts ten months ago. What they will do for you is help you try to understand why you are feeling the way you are. There are group sessions everyday where you and others who are feeling the same way you do try to talk things out. You will talk about daily goals on what you will do for the day and how you will achieve tour goals and what you are trying to overcome in terms of mental health. You will also talk about long term goals as well. Everyday is different and it helps a ton. You will also be speaking to a psychiatrist one on one and they will help you with getting on a better path for yourself. My psychiatrist gave me so many papers full of information on anxiety and depression. There will also be activities there you can do to help manage your stress. But most of all, you will always be surrounded with people who want to help you."
socialanxiety,fcilzov,t1_fcik45d,1577664799.0,"Deep breathing doesn’t work for everyone, it was good that you tried though. What I do whenever I feel anxious in public is listen to music. It distracts me enough to where I can try to focus on the lyrics and not to overthink about my situation. You could try it too. You can also choose to sing the lyrics of the songs your listening to as well. Whenever you go to an event like a dinner with others you can have one ear bud in playing music. When I do this my brother thinks I’m rude for listening to music and not fully involved in the conversation but he doesn’t understand how bad my anxiety can get. If people question why you do this then you can explain how bad your anxiety can get if you are able to. If it helps me, it could help you too. Also, instead of just standing out in the dark, you could have gone for a walk for a few minutes. Just some things you can do in that scenario."

socialanxiety,fccr14h,t3_egzhgo,1577601618.0,"I don’t think he will make any moves towards you because I believe in his mind he has already been rejected once when he gave you the note saying that he loves you and nothing happened, so maybe he doesn’t want to get rejected twice by the same person. You will have to be completely honest in how you feel about him when you two are alone. 
If he is going out of his way to be with you then he does care about you and want to spend time with you. You can tell him how much you appreciate him doing that for you and how much it means to you that he is willing to open up about his past to you. This will tell him that you do listen and care about him"
