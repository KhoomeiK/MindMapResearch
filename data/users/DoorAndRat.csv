Art,fevymoe,t1_fevyc3f,1579403207.0,That seems like an extreme description honestly. There is trash and homeless but not really any worse than other major cities in the US. I've honestly been approached by more aggressive homeless in Chicago or Atlanta than I have in Portland.

Showerthoughts,fesbftz,t1_fes15wt,1579363497.0,"I still pay my rent by physically dropping off a check to the receptionist every beginning of the month because they don't have an online pay portal or really any other option.


I also used to get paid cash as a 1099 employee and needed to get 2 money order checks every 2 weeks because each money order is limited to $1,000 so anything over that needs to be a separate check.
 (This was the early days working as an edible chef, because the laws prevented cannabis companies from getting bank accounts. Luckily things have changed.)"
EarthPorn,fepvozr,t1_feprj5u,1579332991.0,"There are so many spots depending on what region you are visiting. You could walk the trail up to Red Rocks and visit their small museum/see the amphitheatre then drive a little farther to Lair o' the Bear for some hiking. You could see the Colorado Sand Dunes which is home to an international dark park where you could do some stargazing and astrophotography. Drive up Mt. Evans or Pike's Peak as mentioned earlier in the thread. There are several beautiful spots in the Rocky Mountain National Park and you could easily fit a tour of the Stanley Hotel in the same trip. 

These are just some of the more popular areas, but there are many many more beautiful landscapes across the state.

Edit: oh and Cave of the Winds and Garden of the Gods of course."
