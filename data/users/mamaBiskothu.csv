ProgrammerHumor,ff3tldz,t1_ff3ie7k,1579548568.0,For sure. Hope you don't beat yourself up over it though. Many of us go through these phases and it's best just to learn from it and keep marching forward (myself spent most of my 20s doing a PhD I never needed and losing out on the entire career growth trajectory I could've had if I had gone into tech in the beginning itself)

Best of all, you can sort movies by highest predicted rating (which has almost never gone wrong for me) and you can get obscure-ass movies that don't even stream anywhere.

Also you get to watch more or less whatever movie you want, at Blu-ray quality (which beats streaming even today in raw quality). Cherry on top, I love posting mail and receiving mail and the excitement of getting a red envelope is just lovely."

Like one of my motivations for working so hard at my job is so that I can afford to go to Hunan province and have authentic spicy Chinese food there. And I'm not single haha."

Especially packages and stuff. And maintenance is super quick, and the quality of care amazing. Also the entire building is kept up so posh it's just gotta cost a thousand a month each tenant."

PhilosophyofScience,fcr8tz0,t1_fcr1yer,1577898452.0,"Did a PhD in a lab where the professors epitomized every aspect of what I'd consider is wrong with academia and they did something similar in a smaller scale as well.

They kind of created a new field around a gene, and initially proposed that this Gene is important in one part of the body. This initial proposal was not based on solid evidence, just circumstantial ones. 

Later a colleague in our own lab started seeing data that this Gene is actually important in a very different part. The professors (obvious to most in the lab) deliberately kept undermining his findings. Most times they'd just critique his results with a level of scrutiny that's absurd and made him do outrageous numbers of experiments. They literally stretched that project over ten years and this dude just had no choice but to bend to their whims.

When they finally realized that if they didn't publish it someone else will, they wrote a paper that deliberately undermined this result as much as possible and published in the most mediocre journal possible. I really feel for the guy.

I and my colleagues spent years discussing their motivations and even confronted them when  we were leaving the lab. It boils down to ego, not wanting to concede that they were wrong, and a genuine fear that this rewrite of their findings will sabotage their grant future and undermine their credibility. In the end I'm thankful I worked for them because they gave  a crash course of everything wrong with academia and saved me a life of regret. Goes without saying I'm not in academia anymore."

I'm sure a well reviewed book on Amazon would suffice."
