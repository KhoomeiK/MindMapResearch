Online convos don't provide quite as much social interaction but it's certainly better than nothing! When I was completely home bound I spent a lot of time watching YouTube and talking to people in various online communities where I felt heard. It definitely kept me from losing my mind. 

They can be expensive but is there any way you can get a motorized wheelchair/scooter? That could give you back some mobility and a sense of freedom. If you or your partner could drive you there's often support groups for disabilities. It could give you some more structure as well as combating loneliness and isolation. If you like creative projects you can look into stuff that has less fine motor skills or strength/stamina based stuff. Instead of traditional knitting there's super giant yarn where you use your whole arm instead of needles, instead of standard painting there's finger painting or paint pouring, you can use a blowdart with paintballs to paint, maybe origami could work, etc. I don't know your exact limitations so you'd have to narrow it down but there's options besides the ""normal"" forms of creativity"

I say violence isn't the answer but at the same time I don't feel bad for the guy at all, a knockout seems like organic justice"
trashy,ffr7huh,t1_ffqz4xs,1580152131.0,"Most cases of abuse never escalate to murder, if they did the murder rate would be through the roof. You can decide for yourself if a life of misery and abuse is better or worse than death. I absolutely encourage people to leave their abusers because no one deserves to live like that. But stories like the one above can contribute to the idea of ""well why didn't you just leave?"" and blaming the victim for staying when it's usually not that simple. I doubt their comment had any malicious intent and can be an inspiring story to some victims. It's just complicated and I think it's important to keep that in mind. There's no one right way to respond to an abusive relationship, but there are programs to help people get out no matter their situation, a lot of them free"
trashy,ffqkpsh,t1_ffqbewv,1580137226.0,"A lot of abusers are just scared and insecure people trying to cope with that. It doesn't make their actions ok in the slightest. It's an explanation not an excuse. That means sometimes standing up to them sometimes stops the abuse completely because they are faced with their insecurities. _But it's an extremely risky move._ Some abusers back down, others come back swinging twice as hard. Responding with violence can land one or both in the hospital or worse. I'm glad your story has a happy ending and she got away from that guy. But I can't say every story ends like that"
trashy,ffqjtqc,t1_ffqcw3p,1580136563.0,"I hate that question ""Why did you let him do that?"" It shows so much ignorance about abusive relationships and is also victim blaming. Often the answer is as simple as ""I was scared of what they'd do if I tried to leave"" getting abused is one thing, murdered is something else. And no they rarely start off abusive, and if they do it happens because the person was abused before so they expect that kind of treatment. I always thought I was ""too smart"" to fall into an abusive relationship until it happened. And I didn't even realize it was abuse. Sure he threatened to rape me if I didn't do what he wanted but he was ""so sweet"" deep down. Almost 6 years later and I have an actually nice boyfriend but I'm still working on the issues my ex gave me. It's never as easy as ""just leave"""

ehlersdanlos,ffpfo5t,t1_ffperyc,1580093883.0,I use [LA Girl](https://www.amazon.com/L-Girl-Coverage-Liquid-Foundation/dp/B01M8HNHAK) mixed with a few other pale foundations depending on what my skin is doing. It's pretty cheap and my skin doesn't freak out over it! There's some other brands too if you prefer a different coverage or anything
