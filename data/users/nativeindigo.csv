People of different generations, people their to express support for their kids, gay men, gay women, then of course my trans husband. They were some good people. Thanks for the encouragement. We definitely plan on continuing to stay active in receiving & giving support. It’s so important to hear others’ perspectives & to give your own."
mypartneristrans,ffjy4t9,t1_ffdlpq7,1580010162.0,"I’m sorry to hear you & your wife have had to go through so much heartache. It’s incredible how one can love, yet not support. It makes absolutely no sense.  Your wife is a lucky lady to have support from you, it only takes one person to make a difference. I don’t understand the grieving process, like yeah maybe you’ll miss things about them, but they are still the same person they’ve always been - just a better version of themselves. It’s so sad & unfortunate how many trans people commit suicide. It’s a significant amount. I’m glad your wife is still with you today, I’m sure your support means so much to her. You have probably saved her life more than once. 

Since I made this post my FIL preached to my husband over the phone & then continued to yell at him. He was going on about how this isn’t him & calling him by his birth name & female pronouns. He was gaslighting hard, it was extremely disrespectful. I now have complete disgust towards him. My husband still wants to figure out how to make peace with him, but I don’t feel too positive about it. My MIL told him this morning that she cannot accept him transitioning & that she would not be able to be around him because of his physical changes, but that she would use male pronouns when talking to him. Then my husband proceeded to tell her that they can have a relationship without talking to each other on the phone (because of the voice change on T) & without seeing each other in person. Then I guess she had a change of heart. My husband is excited about her all of a sudden support & acceptance. Which I don’t believe. I love my MIL as a person & have gotten close to her, but I personally cannot accept her full support because what’s already been said & done has happened. I’ve gone through this with my own family when I came out of the closet myself then didn’t receive the love & support that I needed. I just can’t trust her & I will only believe her when or if I see it. I still honor my husband in the decisions he makes & I support him in the relationships with his family that he wants to work through. I am in the sidelines of it all. I decided that when the time comes I will ask my husband who he wants me to talk to if anyone, then just trust what he needs me to do at the time. 

I appreciate you telling your story, it’s been insightful to me. I am okay with ranting. It’s good for the soul."
mypartneristrans,ffjwlwc,t1_ffdjxdv,1580008946.0,"My husband & I have very open communication. I am very supportive of him, I wouldn’t do anything he would feel uncomfortable with. I run everything by him, as this is his journey & I want to be as respectful as possible. We’ve discussed ways for me to support him, he says he just needs me to be here for him. I agree with this. I wrote this post to get perspective from others in ways that I could support my husband going through a hard time. This is the first time I’ve gone through something like this, it helps hearing what others have experienced. I’m open to anything outside of the realm of what I could possibly think of."
Dissociation,fffbnro,t1_ffduitm,1579880407.0,That absolutely makes sense. I 100% feel the same way. Although I don’t know how to keep it under control. Any tips on how to?
ptsd,ff9dnu6,t1_ff8pht4,1579710736.0,"I hope you figure out what works best for you. It’s really difficult to even focus on basic needs in life when you disassociate so often. If you want anything bad enough you’ll make it happen. I believe in you! To me there is no career or any amount of money that would make me sacrifice my heath. I used to get that way at my job. I had to quit. I’ve learned that working full time isn’t a healthy option for me. Why torture myself if I don’t have to, yano?"
bipolar,ff9bgkk,t1_ff8w77x,1579709154.0,"I don’t usually snap to from loud noises, although I am very jumpy on the regular. I actually get pretty numb & quiet when I am disassociating. I don’t react to much. I don’t know how to stop either. It happens less when I get good nights sleep. It’s survival instinct, it kicks in so fast. I don’t even think about it."

Dissociation,ff87iff,t1_ff86oss,1579668218.0,Cognitive behavioral therapy & dialectical behavioral therapy. It’s a bunch of coping skills to live a healthy life. It’s a game changer for sure. I learned CBT for intensive outpatient treatment then afterwards did a 6 month DBT program. I suggest this therapy to everyone. I think they actually teach these skills in some schools now. It’s literally saved my life.

bipolar,ff85zbq,t3_es69qo,1579666935.0,"Isn’t it wild? I couldn’t imagine if I wasn’t medicated. I have so many symptoms even being medicated. It’s like I don’t know if I’ll ever find the right cocktail. If I do, how long will it even last? I wish the best for you! Hopefully you can find meds that work for you. It’s totally worth it."
bipolar,ff85qyd,t3_es64c2,1579666747.0,I feel you. If it wasn’t for my spouse I would have stopped my meds again for sure. I’ve been on & off meds for the last 10 years. It’s exhausting. It’s ironic how a symptom of having bipolar disorder is to be in denial about disorder. It’s some pretty fun stuff. It’s also hard to admit that in order to be functional one must be medicated for the rest of their lives. So worth the reward though.
bipolar,ff85gmy,t3_es6ab6,1579666515.0,"I understand not being able to afford much, I myself do not live off of much money. Do you have insurance? If not there is state assistance for receiving mental health. I used insurance from the state for about a year since I couldn’t afford much until I got insurance through my spouse. I lived my life in a dysphoric mania episode just like yourself for 6 months even while still being medicated. It took a new dr & a new med to get my life back on track. Personally I know I would benefit from therapy as well, I’m just not ready to go back down that road, the thought of spending money on that doesn’t sound fun either. At the least I make sure I’m ALWAYS medicated, because it gets real wild otherwise. I am still trying to get back on track after a couple months of new meds. Dysphoric mania has been the worst of the WORST episodes of my entire life. Getting help is an investment. This is literally your life at stake. If you want something bad enough you will make it happen. It’s worth it."

mypartneristrans,ff38lfj,t3_ercuk6,1579536256.0,"By telling your boyfriend about it I think it would be a lot less stressful for you. Communication is so important in relationships. Maybe you could come up with a resolution & if not at least you have your partner you can talk to about the situation. Being trans comes with people questioning your gender. It sucks, but that’s just the way it is. I’m sure your boyfriend could understand the position you’re in."
pansexual,ff373dm,t3_eqrooa,1579535253.0,"You feel confident in your family being accepting of you. With that being said I think it could actually grow your bonds & relationships with those in your family. Yeah, they don’t necessarily need to know. I think it’s more so about being yourself around those you love. Why not embrace it?! You know you have that unconditional love. I haven’t come out to my family as pan because they are very conservative & don’t understand or seem to care to know anything about the lgbtq community. They know I’ve dated both sexes, primarily the same sex. So for me that’s good enough. They don’t know that my husband is trans yet, so that may change the game for me soon. For you though, I feel like you have the perfect opportunity to be closer to your family."

Anxiety,fevv8dj,t3_eqjipy,1579401924.0,"I can relate all too well with your experiences. The only way to get through it is to get through it. Although my personal anxiety is a little different than yours I can understand the immense fear of having others witness your creativity. I am a writer & I struggle with others reading my words. It's the fear of judgment that seems to overrule all else, all logic. I take meds for anxiety as well, it helps. Meds never take it completely away. Smoking weed is my most effective cure. I enjoy smoking at night, getting a good nights sleep, then the following day my brain is functioning at a slower speed so I am able to rationalize my thoughts which lessens my fear. It also takes away all of the bad dreams, literally the best sleep I ever have. I smoke one to one (half cbd/half thc) vape pens, when I smoke them it makes me feel normal with less anxiety, but doesn't make me feel high. It works great to smoke throughout the day. RSO (Rick Simpson Oil) is magical. I put some on my anxiety meds & take it then it lasts the entire day. I pick one of the above depending on what I have & it's truly the most effective way I've ever dealt with anxiety. I do not endorse breaking the law, however if you have these legal resources in your state I highly recommend. I've gone through intensive therapy as well with CBT & DBT, which has allowed me to learn many healthy coping skills as well. Enough about me. I hope this helps."

I’ve never heard of dysphoric mania until now. That’s wild. Thank you for commenting. I appreciate it more than you know. I only know what I research, medical professionals don’t explain what’s happening to me. This has been the worst episode of my life & it lasted so long because of a bad psych."

pansexual,fendxy8,t3_eq1mj7,1579282622.0,"I think it’s more than acceptable for you to identify as being pansexual. When I think of bisexual I think of being with strictly men or women, which can include androgynous appearances. When I think of pansexual I think of being with anything & everything in between a man or woman. I personally identify as pansexual. I have primarily been in relationships with women, although I’ve had a few relationships with feminine men. I’ve never been attracted to MTF, but have always been attracted to FTM. For me, because I am so open minded & I am willing to be with someone who is trans that tells me that I’m pansexual. There is no black & white answer. This is your identity & whatever you identify with is what you are. I hope this helps."
Anxiety,fena0ky,t1_femip4u,1579280210.0,Cognitive behavioral therapy & dialectical behavioral therapy. I went through intensive therapy to learn them & it changed my life. There is a lot of information online & in books you can find. Marsha Linehan is the one who compiled information to create DBT. I highly recommend checking her out if you’re interested. She has a lot of videos you can find on YouTube.

mypartneristrans,fen9jow,t1_femmnio,1579279921.0,Thank you for sharing your experience. I really really really do appreciate it. I’m glad you commented. It sounds like you’re both in difficult positions. Maybe she just needs more time? Maybe there is a different root cause for what’s going on? I don’t know. Some people never get there. Usually because of fear of others’ judgments. I think it’s great that you are ready to be so supportive in such a scary process. Good luck to both of you.

mypartneristrans,fema8e5,t1_felw0tk,1579245665.0,It’ll be interesting what our experience will be like once they actually begin the transition process. My spouse is ready to start HRT yesterday. I can’t imagine what your experience was like. It’s definitely different for everyone & I could see how it would be scary for one to take the steps to completely alter their body.

mypartneristrans,fellbl6,t1_felj65a,1579224910.0,My heart is full knowing that you’ve had a similar experience. I love hearing the positivity that comes from others’ stories. It’s occasionally been difficult for me allowing them to come out when they’re ready just because in the back of my mind there was a voice screaming at me to just tell them already what they didn’t know. Everyone has a different journey & must go at their own pace. It takes some patience for sure. Congrats on the engagement! I’m so happy for you two.
mypartneristrans,felkqbe,t1_felaglg,1579224512.0,"Your girlfriend is a lucky lady to have you as her person. What a beautiful thing love at first sight is. It truly shows your unconditional love for her. It surprises me so much how people’s sexuality plays such a big role in transitioning. I get it to an extent, I’m just a little more open minded than most. Being pan immensely helps in the process of supporting their transition. I appreciate the input of the perspective of it being more about sexuality than love. It’s so true."
mypartneristrans,felaxv1,t1_fela59x,1579217921.0,Thank you for sharing your story. That’s absolutely amazing that even through all of the confusion & emotions you were able to go from where you were to where you are now. It makes my heart happy hearing about others who have grown with their spouse through transitioning. Especially with children involved. It’s just so beautiful.
