Going through my post history was a low blow. A move by a coward. YES YOU ARE A FUCKING COWARD. You have used my past posts on this sub and r/suicidewatch to attack me. I've posted that shit in vulnerable moments of my life and you are using it against me. If you want to argue with me, do it in good faith. Or give me your address and we can solve this shit with our fists."
depression,ff1z8wh,t1_ff1vwek,1579489637.0,"So you took the time to go through my history huh? That's so pathetic. You come here to be an asshole to people and get offended when you get called out. You're a coward, too. Yes I am shitty, but you are in a whole another level of shittiness. And I would gladly give away this ""privilege"" i never wanted in the first place, dickhead. And you admit you made an asshole comment. So delete it. You had no need to be an asshole here. I'll keep calling you out on your assholery until you do."

depression,ff17mt1,t1_ff1270d,1579476069.0,I don't understand why you're defending him. He came to a support sub to kick people that are down in the head.
depression,ff0wb54,t1_ff0uzq8,1579472875.0,"That doesn't justify the lack of empathy. College is soul crushing, and is not ""optional"" to everyone. My mom threatened to kick me out the house when I wanted to drop out. I don't live with her anymore and I'm still struggling to get my degree. How I wish I could've skipped college. He's a fucking douchebag with no empathy."

BikiniBottomTwitter,fdy9g09,t1_fdy42o5,1578777422.0,29 and I'm on the same boat :(
