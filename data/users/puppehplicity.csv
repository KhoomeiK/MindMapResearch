CPTSD,ffmgz8m,t3_eu7kbz,1580054554.0,"Mine aren't for CPTSD specifically, but they very much help me manage.

I take escitalopram (antidepressant), lamotrigine (mood stabilizer), and buspirone (anxiolytic). When I was having a very hard time with flashbacks about four years ago I briefly took quetiapine (antipsychotic)."

""I'm gonna give all that I've got to give, cross my heart and hope to live."" -- Phil Ochs, ""Cross My Heart"" 

Basically no matter how terrifying and overwhelming something is, I will stick to my principles. If it kills me, ok. But I won't roll over and give up.

In much the same vein... there's a quote from Dierdre Wells in Limetown's fifth (full length podcast) episode.  I can't find it right now but it's something very much like ""You have to keep going. It seems impossible but you can't let them win, you can't destroy yourself.""

Also, The Tragically Hip's ""Courage (For Hugh Maclennan)"" has gotten me through a lot of very hard times.

""There's no simple explanation for anything important any of us do. Yeah, the human tragedy consists in the necessity of living with the consequences under pressure, under pressure."""
AskReddit,ffgv3j3,t1_ffgcvy0,1579915819.0,"If we don't ask for help, it's toxic masculinity (aka our own fault).

If we do, it must be because we feel entitled to others' emotional labor, which is toxic masculinity, and again our fault.

Fuck. Don't make it a gender thing. We're people, same as anyone else. We are complex people... and INDIVIDUAL people. Just treat us like regular human beings."
MensRights,ffgfrr7,t1_ffe7sdu,1579905239.0,"Document, document, document.

Document like your job depends on it... because it probably does. 

I am guessing you have security cameras in the building. This is good and will help you. Also back up your emails obviously.

But also keep a little notebook with you, and not down notes if you need to. If someone yells at you, write down (AS IT HAPPENS OR RIGHT AFTER)  who, when, where, why, what they said, who saw it... and then who you alerted, when, and in what form. If someone threatens you, even if it seems like maybe they are kidding, same thing. If someone sexually harasses you, even if it doesn't seem like that big of a deal, same thing.

If this seems excessive, or if you don't want to be a troublemaker in bringing this stuff to light, I get  it. Been there done that. But you matter, and anyone worth working with/for knows that, so you have to protect yourself, and help them help you."
MensRights,ffgf17a,t1_ffft895,1579904776.0,"Honestly, dude, DO THIS.

I'm autistic and had an absolutely brutal time at a former worksite because there was such a personality mismatch. Many times people assumed I was lazy, aloof, or outright lying... but I simply was focused on doing my job as best I could.

You might be autistic. Or you might not be. But look into it. The fact that I am open with my diagnosis helped me a lot with my department and my boss (who are all wonderful anyway, but really went above and beyond to help). But also be advised that there are some who may use that against you, even though it's unethical and illegal."

AskReddit,ffg7d03,t1_ffevsgx,1579900037.0,I would no doubt be suicidal (because I just get that way any time I feel like I am about to incur serious punishment) but I would also be so fucking curious that I would have to stick around and find out what happened.
MensRights,ffg4o5s,t1_fffryn2,1579898382.0,"I really don't care about ugly tits, tbh. It's not like every man has perfect pecs or a flat chest. Hell there are dudes out there with bigger man boobs than some women's actual boobs.

If you don't wanna wear a shirt while you're mowing the lawn or swimming or something, go for it, regardless of gender."

autism,ffc9j1n,t3_ess447,1579794617.0,"I'm alright at visualizing some things I know very well (a mental walk-through of the building where I work, for example) but absolutely rotten at other things, be they new or lifelong.

I have lived in my hometown for 24 of my 30 years. I can visualize segments of the city in, like, chunks of a map to find my way around... but it's like someone tore up a big paper map into a few dozen pieces and shuffled them around. There's nothing coherent about it.

I can't envision what my parents or my brother look like, and we are very close. Neither can I envision what most anyone else looks like, no matter how often I see them or how many photos of them I have seen. I pretty much wouldn't recognize my own brother at the Meijer if I wasn't expecting to see him. It's not true faceblindness because I can follow TV and movies just fine, but I also can't really draw to mind what Jesse Pinkman looks like even though I have seen Breaking Bad (and everything else in that universe) a million times.

If I am working on a project, I have to draw a diagram or a map for it, I can't do it in my head. I learn best by doing something repetitively."

I really don't give a shit what your junk looks like or how much melanin you have. I want to know what you really intend to achieve (and how) with the economy, foreign policy, infrastructure, medicine, criminal justice, and preserving domestic rights.

MensRights,ff50pw8,t3_erht52,1579577113.0,"Uhhh...  rape is caused by a person deciding to have sex with someone without their consent. That's pretty much just it.

It's not hormones, it's not alcohol, it's not the way someone dresses, it's not that someone just can't resist... it's that they either didn't ask, asked someone who couldn't give a meaningful answer, or asked and ignored the answer.

I mean Jesus it's not that hard.

Notice I say people. Men can rape and be raped. Women can rape and be raped. It isn't evil men vs. scared women... it's shitty rapists regardless of their gender vs normal people regardless of their gender. Hormones have fuckall to do with it, and introducing the argument is just a strawman."
