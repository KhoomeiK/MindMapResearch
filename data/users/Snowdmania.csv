There’s stuff they had been building up and setting up for seasons... and then they didn’t do anything with it. For example, for ages we were wondering who one characters real parents were, and then we found out his real parents meant he was eligible for the throne and possibly had a connection to dragons and... it effected the plot in absolutely no way - it ended up being a bit of trivia that they hyped up and had us wonder about for nothing. They killed a bunch of characters and then the next episode they were all there. At the end everyone should have been mad at eachother and there could have been an epic final battle - and it ended a skip to months later and the characters having an anticlimactic business conference. The whole question of the show was who would win the iron throne in the end and it ends up going to the most bland character who the show had purposefully ruled out so they had went back on everything they’d said about the character."

Apart from New Zealand, other countries don’t allow advertising to consumers at all. 

Scientists used to believe in chemical imbalances because SSRIs which increase serotonin helps with depression, but this view is no longer accepted as that’s like saying “pain is caused by a natural shortage of aspirin in the body as aspirin helps with pain.” You have hundreds of neurotransmitters in your brain and it would be overly simplistic to say one controls something as complex as depression.
