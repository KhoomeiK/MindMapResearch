They're incredibly proud of being English despite really knowing nothing of history beyond the fact that we won the world wars, once had an empire and that 1066 is important for some reason. These few pieces of knowledge give them the impression that Britain should still be a leading superpower on the world stage, for some reason. They seem to believe that pure stubbornness and ""blitz spirit"" will achieve that, despite the fact that they never lived through the blitz and instead have had fairly comfortable lives.

They proudly don't speak anything foreign, or eat anything foreign (apart from a curry or Chinese takeaway). Excursions out of the country are strictly to visit family who have moved to Australia, or to the same Spanish resort every year where they will loudly order a stream of cheap lager in English while turning increasing shades of red. Leaving the country is also permitted once retired, when it is permissable to retire in Spain, in a small community of other English where every effort will be made to avoid Spanish language or food.

In cultures where women are more restricted or repressed, other women are often some of the most in favour of restricting and repressing, because they've been raised in this system and resent women who enjoy freedoms that they didn't.

So you get women who were told from a young age to be meek, modest, and ashamed of their sexuality, watching younger women grow up without the same shame and with control over their own lives. Those first women can do one of two things, they can realise that their internalised shame and repression was for nothing, or they can shame the second group so that they experience the consequences that they thought they would face.
