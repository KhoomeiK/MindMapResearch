BeardedDragons,feigf4e,t3_epbitf,1579137934.0,Just a little background on his missing toes if anyone thinks it’s odd. [where dem toes?](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeardedDragons/comments/eoq9xp/rescued_this_guy_when_he_was_3_months_from_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
BeardedDragons,feig8at,t1_feidgf7,1579137806.0,Hmm 🤔i built him a rock a while back with foam and grout and all the whole 9 researched for weeks i really don’t wanna go that route this time around it’s so hard to find sealants with low VOCs. i want to get something that’s made already ☺️ but i might look into the brick idea. As long as it seems safe.
marinebiology,feicwh1,t1_fecn4gy,1579135563.0,Thank you. Unfortunately the people here are the problem not the state itself i love Florida just hate the people so I’m moving 😂 but they were a joy to watch.

BeardedDragons,feedmeb,t3_eoo3zs,1579031582.0,Mine loves collard greens and occasionally i give him kale. But lettuce isn’t really good for anything other then water which is still good. Just not nutritious. Trust me this was a huge learning curve for me! Good luck google a lot!
BeardedDragons,feed6bw,t3_eo2f0l,1579031320.0,This is so cool.

Awwducational,feceixy,t1_feaprlf,1578972020.0,Nice you should join my subreddit! Your very knowledgeable☺️ there was about 7 i counted or so i thought i have more vids on my subreddit
Awwducational,fecebzr,t1_febzixz,1578971887.0,The water level rises and falls with the tide so I’m sure there are times they get stuck but there is plenty of space for them and enough water even during low tide.  They would be safer to raise young then the ocean.
Awwducational,fece2r1,t1_fea5cyx,1578971713.0,They are aware they are here their are signs posted everywhere on the bank telling you to leave them alone and no fishing and to report if you find one injured but people fish and drive boats through here anyway no1 cares here it’s Florida. It’s the norm down here.
MajesticManatees,fec78d9,t3_eoc8ym,1578967849.0,Haha so cute 😍
Awwducational,fec6vqf,t1_fec6ruf,1578967667.0,I posted it there already ☺️ i was posting the source it’s my own personal video the original and full video is on my subreddit.
Awwducational,fec6dp7,t1_fec69ru,1578967398.0,Not a great idea but would be cool if you could but you shouldn’t they need to be afraid of us or they will die more from boats.
WTF,fec67sw,t1_febx2mw,1578967312.0,Yes so sad unfortunately people think it’s a good idea to come close to them I’ve seen people right on the bank taking pictures. I only film from the balcony because you can see str8 into the water from above ☺️
Awwducational,fec61y0,t1_fec5sk7,1578967230.0,Hey neighbor!
Awwducational,fec5ynq,t1_fec5s4m,1578967185.0,Yeah they taste like 100k federal fine and up to a year and jail 😂

Awwducational,fec5pd5,t1_fec5lru,1578967050.0,Basically Jurassic park with Mickey Mouse 😂
marinelife,fec5c5p,t3_enzx5k,1578966883.0,r/majesticmanatees for the full video and more. Thanks for the support! I want to bring awareness to these kind gentle giants. That it’s cool to look but not to touch or feed or come to close because they need to fear humans for their own survival. The manatee plays a important part in keeping our ocean clean.  human contact will put them in more danger of boating accidents which was the number one cause of manatee deaths in 2019. 2018 it was natural causes. So a lot changed in a year plus climate change is on the rise. Even tho manatees aren’t endangered anymore they are classified as a threatened species 😫
Awwducational,fec45bx,t1_febs4qk,1578966382.0,I just live here 😂

Awwducational,fec3tjv,t1_febxk7k,1578966247.0,For those who are curious i do not abuse them i film from my second story balcony. I have a iPhone that zooms pretty well it just looks like I’m close. Also i do not feed them it’s illegal to feed any wildlife here or manatees for that matter. I just observe and enjoy how serene they are while I’m on my porch. It’s especially wild when I’m smoking a joint 😂 i can stare at these guys for ever.
WTF,fec2ww0,t1_fec2lgm,1578965878.0,Of course! I’m on my balcony filming

Awwducational,feaqgr3,t1_feaq8u8,1578951359.0,Because they are a threatened species ☺️ they just came off the endangered list Farley recently I’m pretty sure.
Awwducational,feanuy3,t1_feam0iu,1578950688.0,I filmed with from my balcony
Awwducational,feanr7a,t1_feam0iu,1578950659.0,It’s illegal :( i wish but for their own good i stay far away. Don’t want them trusting humans that’s what gets them killed by boat propellers.

Awwducational,fe8kqih,t1_fe8k4j4,1578927250.0,I live in a apartment complex across from a golf course I’m not really sure but I’ve never seen them spray in the back yard because it’s a pet friendly community. So i hope not! That would be horrible! 😫 i think they are pretty safe it’s a brackish water way connected to the inter coastal. They eat the grass on the side of the bank so I’m pretty sure they don’t spray let’s hope.
WTF,fe8hu9d,t1_fe6sh5f,1578926322.0,I think about the same thing. So said. Boats also often speed by and theirs been a few oil gas spills over the past year. 😫 they seem okay and happy tho.
cute,fe6lnxp,t1_fe5vq37,1578895077.0,Awesome! Wish we had dolphins! We have jumping fish tho.
WTF,fe6ljep,t1_fe6jrtx,1578894946.0,It’s hard to see in the video but i counted 6-7 including the baby. Some stay back way from the edge maybe to watch out for everyone idk 😂 such cool animals tho

florida,fe6dyti,t1_fe6asy7,1578888096.0,Broward county
WTF,fe6aoxq,t1_fe69xlw,1578885618.0,It’s a brackish water way i believe I’m not too educated on the water ways here But it’s i guess connected to the inter-coastal they come in and out to feed and breed i pretty sure. I think it’s just a safe place for them.  ☺️ lots of wildlife come here last year we had like a million ducks from up north come and make this spot their home for a few month before they flew back 😂
WTF,fe6a6sg,t1_fe69w8h,1578885254.0,I heard that! I’m to afraid to have one of my neighbors report me. I think it’s illegal but don’t want to risk it either way they have plenty to eat. Their was a pod of about 6-7 and a baby i see them eating everyday I’m sure they have plenty but still i hear ya they are cool if want to feed them also if i could!
