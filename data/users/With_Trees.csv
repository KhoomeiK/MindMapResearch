Contrary to popular belief, disabled people still need money to exist. They aren't half-people. Moreover, paying them less than minimum wage traps them in a situation where they must rely on external assistance to fund themselves [If you don't earn enough to afford rent, you'll have to continue living with your parents, in a hostel, etc], therefore hinder them from gaining any real independence.

2. I worked with cognitively disabled people in all sorts of situations. In most of them, they didn't do a lesser job than their non-disabled peers. Often quite the opposite.

AskReddit,ffcc1hl,t3_espxtw,1579796198.0,"Something like a decade ago, I had a girlfriend I was madly in love with. It was a toxic relationship, though, and be broke up in bad terms.

Said girl had nothing going for her. She had some massive untreated PTSD, plus fibromyalgia, which caused her to drop out of high school. She was waiting tables and taking cleaning jobs which also took a toll on her health, and she had trouble keeping due to said illnesses.

While we were together, I let her stay at my place and took care of her quite openly. After we broke up, she basically had no one. I learnt from her Facebook posts that she was sick, unemployed and literally peniless - had no money even for food. 

I drove to her place and left a couple bags of groceries, including some sweets I know she liked, and cold medication.
Then went online and sent her resume to a Virtual Assistant sort of company, where I knew several of the low-level managers, and contacted them letting them know and told them she's brilliant and hard working.

She started working there two weeks later, and, to my knowledge, managed to keep it for several years."

I discovered throughout university that I'm really good at it. I can break down a task intuitively, estimate time frames for each part and the most efficient order of doing them, figure out what is needed, budgets, who should do what...

But I absolutely hate doing it. I don't like telling other people what to do, and having to make sure they actually do it. More often than not, I feel like it would be far less trouble to do it myself."
AskReddit,ffbyad4,t3_esi1iu,1579786620.0,"I used to joke with my ex that she put a curse on workplaces she quit from at bad terms - all of them closed shortly after.

The last one started off as a lovely tea shop/café. It had very high quality products, good food, and the staff were pretty a amazing group of people.
But the owner apparently had a drug abuse problem, which may or may not have caused him to decide to rapidly expand the business, rent a place several times bigger, and turn it into a full restaurant + bar[?!].
He hired a bunch of new staff, all of which were pretty obviously incompetent.
The new [mostly useless] kitchen manager sexually assaulted my ex. There were two witnesses, too -  the cook [who worked in that place for over 8 years] and another waitress.
When my ex complained, he told her she's making it up [that was very uncharacteristic and alarming]. The cook and the other waitress came forward to support her, and he just fired them. In private, he told the cook that he knows it's probably true but he invested too much money in the kitchen manager, so they can't fire them.

When the news reached the rest of the staff, all of them pretty much walked out in the next few days.

He tried to hire new staff, but it seemed nobody lasted there for more than a couple of weeks, and many left because of the toxic atmosphere. The restaurant+bar thing, which was way more expansive and had none of the intimate, casual atmosphere of the original place, was an obvious failure. After three months, he announced he's closing the restaurant+bar in order to focus on the online shop, claiming it had always been the more profitable side of the business... The online shop closed shortly after."

Technically, your sister isn't wrong by stating that a lot of bullies act the way they do because they're also miserable. However, she seems to think that somehow makes her past actions more excusable - which implies she isn't entirely accepting responsibility for her past behaviour.

You aren't wrong either, pointing out that people in pain don't necessarily turn to bullying and aggression, and that this does not actually shifts the blame from her. However, it sounds like your sister is still in the process of addressing and unlearning her destructive behaviour patterns, and your blunt callout, while technically correct, was probably the last thing she needed."

Let me get this straight:
You hijack a thread by a random person, make hostile comments, make generalized comments about millions of people you've never met being ""awful"", claim you base it on every single person [out of who? Out if what?] you met that was ""awful"", then admit actually not ""all of them"" were ""awful"", then claim you're ""the good guy"" and ""you guys"" [who?] were the ""antagonists"" [of who?]. Then claim your random hijack isn't unprovoked, then admit it actually was unprovoked [but blame the same mysterious ""you guys""]?

I think you need to talk to someone about this."
