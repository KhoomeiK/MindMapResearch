Libraries,fefhuh8,t1_feenl97,1579056632.0,"I have worked for years as a volunteer library technology trainer and one-on-one tech help person. I've been in the same situation many times. It's so frustrating. The library system I volunteer for has a great range of classes, help services, and other programs to help patrons. Even so, there's so little we can do to help people who are under pressure, under-resourced, and have few options. It's easy to feel like the designers of tech systems are out to get us. 

I was trained as a computer scientist specializing in human-computer interaction, and I worked designing systems as an analyst and interaction designer. I never designed job application systems but I worked on similar types of systems. My experience in both corporate and non-profit environments was that the problem was not organizations' purposely designing to exclude certain populations; rather, it was the lack of commitment to inclusion, or to human-centered design in general (for users on all sides of the system, e.g. both HR and applicants). This was often rationalized as cost-saving, but in fact good human-centered design usually reduces costs overall, especially with systems that generate lots of user support requirements, lost opportunities, or operator stress because of bad design."

aww,fdk2ov9,t1_fdjjr37,1578494589.0,"I hear you! My sister was 1year, 3 months older than me. I hero-worshipped her, but also fought with her a ton. I just wanted so bad for her to like me and stop making me the object of her humiliating jokes. I was really non-verbal and would end up losing my temper and hitting or breaking things. It wasn't until I was an adult that our younger brother clued me in to how manipulative and mean she was, especially to me. After trying for a long time, neither of us are in touch with her any more. I feel sad about it and wonder a lot about how she's doing."
