As far as “working” they gave me a stack of pizza pans (not many) and the wife would chat with me while I ‘worked’. The more I think of it, the kinder the people were.

AskReddit,feubqdg,t3_eqmv4r,1579385030.0,"I have a ‘hidden’ illness. I’m in pain all of the time with spasms, etc...

Last month I went to a home diy place and bought a couple pieces of wood trim for a project. Super light. My SO didn’t go with me because it was just trim.  When alone I usually park right next to the cart return, but, there were no spots there so I parked in the handicapped spot as I have a placard.

This diy place puts the cart returns at the end of the parking lanes, furthest away from the handicapped spots.  Usually my SO takes the cart back. I use the cart to hold myself steady.

I decide that I have to leave the cart in the handicapped area as I wasn’t sure I would make it back to my car without falling.

This man walks up to my car and motions for me to open my window.  This is a very busy diy place and there were about 100 people either entering/exiting the store.

He started telling me I was a faking piece of shit for not taking my cart back to the cart return.  He saw he had an audience and became a justice warrior against me. He kept screaming at me that I was a faker and not handicapped. He went on and on, getting louder and louder.  I tried to explain, though I don’t know why.

My husband was so upset and wanted to pull my dash cam footage and post it, I’m assuming on iamatotalpieceofshit.  I wouldn’t let him, but, I cried for 4 days. 

I’m only kind to people and don’t understand people like this."

pics,feu2uqq,t3_eqmigi,1579382610.0,"Growing up I was extremely poor. At 11 I went business to business in our area looking for a job as I needed shoes. A couple who owns a pizza place “hired” me to scrape pizza pans 3 days a week. When I got there they had a fresh slice of pizza and a cold coke. As a starving child that was priceless. By the end of the summer I had “earned” enough to buy a pair of converse. Looking back I see what these beautiful people did and how lucky I was to meet them.

EDIT:  I woke up and this blew up. There are awesome people on Reddit and I just wanted to say that I’m doing great and thank you! This was many years ago. The couple taught me many things during my **short** visits. :) BTW: These were not 4-8 hour shifts.  They were short visits where I “worked” while the wife chatted with me. I don’t think they had kids. They were a lovely Italian couple. I loved their accents so much!  I learned so much from them: Not all adults are mean, not all adults fight, (They would jokingly yell at each other and all I remember is laughter), be kind always, and if you work hard (I was 11 so the ‘working’ part makes me laugh to this day as they probably had to wash the pans twice after I was done) you can achieve your goals. I have the best memories of this time. It didn’t go all through the summer as I remember I had the sneakers by my birthday in the middle of summer. :) 

And for those saying that child services should have been called...this was not a violation of child labor laws. It was a kind couple who let me keep my pride and “earn” my sneakers. Which if I remember correctly, I wouldn’t shut up about. :)"

I hadn’t seen him in many years and when I drove 5 hours to see him in the hospital he thought I was our mother. (She lives on another continent).  I let him believe his mother came to say goodbye and then got to finally meet my sister in law, my niece and nephew. I found out my brother was an amazing human being. They didn’t have a lot of money, but, they had an abundance of love. It was easy to offer to pay.  I now have a wonderful relationship with them.  Too late to know my brother.  Now if my evil narcissistic sister died I wouldn’t even take a moment to reflect on anything. There are no fond memories, just horrific ones."
