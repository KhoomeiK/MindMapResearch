I struggle with remembering words, ideas, what people said etc, remembering people's names and information about them even though I recognise their face. Its slowly getting worse over time and Im a healthy person. My speech is slowly getting less and less fluent which is worring. Wish you the best!"

And after having seen a robbery with my own eyes I knew I had to buy a knife as a hand gun is illegal here in Portugal, but I would buy one for sure if I could."

BitcoinBeginners,fdgehvo,t1_fdgdwaw,1578393001.0,"20-40€ at the moment is not a lot, I could put more but just in the near future probably. I could see myself right now invest just about 60-70€. I do think crypto is the future, just when everyone thought the internet would not have a bright future back in the 90s and 30 years later people cant live without it, I do think the same will happen with BTC and other cryptocurrencies. The lack of authority managing it, how easy and fast it is to trade. It will be worth a lot and if prices get more stable, I do think people will start imvesting in it, the uncertainty here is the time it will take.






From where I am, Portugal, I dont see many people of my age knowing what BTC is exactly and wanting to invest in it. I know 2-3 people but they are older than me."

He made the country richer but the people were very poor, in 1974 there was a revolution and the country has been mostly socialist ever since. The two main parties being the Socialist party and the Social Democratic party, I believe socialism is popular here because of Salazar. Not many idolize him or his views, the ones who do are mostly elderly."
