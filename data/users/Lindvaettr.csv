UpliftingNews,ffc8zz5,t1_ffbt8di,1579794283.0,"The college ID stuff is contentious in part because of the transient nature of college students. The majority of college students in an area are only going to be there for 4 or so years, and generally aren't integrated into the local community. This can mean that college students voting in the place where they go to school can skew results not just towards Democrats, but towards politicians and policies that may not represent the interests of the permanent or long-term residents.

In a place like NYC, Boston, or LA, this might not have an impact, but in towns and cities like Moorhead MN, Fargo ND, or other of the many, many university towns in the US, the very high percentage of college students that make up the population can have very strong impacts on local and state elections in ways that may not align with the general economy or beliefs of the town at large.

I'm not saying college students shouldn't vote, but it's certainly not a one-sided issue."

UpliftingNews,ffc21vf,t1_ffb8h1o,1579789571.0,"This has been my big concern nationally as well. A lot of usually-red congressional districts went blue in 2018 over Trump. For some reason, national Democrats, especially on the campaign trail, seem to have taken that as a mandate to go hard left. 

This seems like a terrible strategy to me. Dems won control of the House by flipping purple and slightly red districts to blue. That means voters in those districts are pretty moderate, or even lean slightly conservative. By going so far left so fast, it seems like the Dems are setting themselves up to lose all those newly-flipped districts when the voters there are forced to choose between Trump Republicans (and for the ones up for vote in 2022, with just 2 years max left with Trump) and increasingly farther left Dems.

Dems should be making it an easy choice for their new supporters, not trying to drive them away."
UpliftingNews,ffc1cjj,t1_ffbnshj,1579789042.0,"It's worth noting that, even according to the almost hilariously liberally biased Vox, studies have shown that [voter ID laws have almost no impact on voter turnout](https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/3/15/14909764/study-voter-id-racism), except that they may slightly increase white turnout in primaries.

Warren, Clinton, and CNN have been attacking Bernie left and right, and doing the same to Gabbard. Coming into the primaries, the Democrats have been slinging shit more and more, hoping to eke out a last-minute advantage. And overall, the Democrats continue to largely assume they'll have a downhill path to victory over Trump, and that they're just fighting over which one of them will get to beat him and be president.

Trump, meanwhile, has the advantage of being a sitting president during one of the most booming stock market periods in most people's lifetimes. Support for his removal is dropping fast, and his approval ratings are likely to go up when the Senate inevitably doesn't remove him.

The sad reality is, unless the Democrats can get their act together, stop racing to the populace left side of their aisle, and put forth a platform that focuses on the overall moderately-left-wing positions of the majority of voters, Trump is going to survive his Senate trial, wait out the DNC nomination, then pick up all the shit the other Dems threw at the winner and lob it right back at them.

We need to stop acting like Trump is going to be an easy victory by Warren or Sanders and recognize that it's going to be an uphill battle all the way, one they're statistically likely to lose."

liberalgunowners,ff409wt,t1_ff3ywmn,1579552733.0,"Not only disdain. Ignorance and selfishness, as well. I don't mean either of those accusatorily.

People in NYC and LA are, like all of us, most concerned with their immediate situations. If you tell me that the government can fix the roads I drive on every day, and put up a park next door, or they can fix the roads in some other place, and put up a park in a different city, I'm going to pick the first one. I want my roads fixed and I want my park.

The same is true for people from NYC and LA. Their own problems, to them, are bigger and more important than other people's problems not because of malice, but because they see those problems every day, and the other problems are just floating in the periphery.

Even beyond that, there's the natural ignorance of what other places need. The solutions a farm town needs are different than what a small mining town needs. The solutions those towns need are different from what LA needs. The living conditions, cultures, outlooks, economic situations all differ significantly. 

A farmer isn't going to know what policies will help Silicon Valley any more than a software engineer in San Fransisco is going to know what will help midwestern farmers.

Liberals are right in saying that getting rid of the electoral college will make democracy more direct and true. But they're wrong that that will fix the problems of the system. All it will do is make the democracy less representative of all the many people of the US. We have one of the most diverse populations in the world, and we need a system that allows all those people to have a voice, even if that sometimes means some voices count more than others. Otherwise, we might as well restrict the vote to white male landowners again."
liberalgunowners,ff3zjzd,t1_ff3xmlg,1579552289.0,"They don't mention race because the established narrative is that 2A supporters are rural conservative white men. The most they mention gender is specifically referring to a group of Women for Trump supporters, and one woman with a rifle (A .50 cal? I don't remember what gun each person they mentioned had).

Other than that, because of the narrative we've been given, there's a natural assumption that the rest are white men. It's important to mention the people who fall outside the narrative.

Imagine I'm writing a story covering a protest for gay rights back in the 90's. If I say, ""Hundreds gathered to demand equal treatment for gay people"", there would be very little need to mention how many gay people were there, because of course they're there. What's more important is to say ""Hundreds gathered, including many straight men and women, to demand equal treatment for gay people"".

Sure, I didn't have to mention their sexuality, because I didn't mention the sexuality of the gay people in attendance either. But by not mentioning information contrary to readers' assumptions, I'm doing nothing to break those potentially incorrect assumptions.

Rural Republican white men supporting gun rights isn't news. Black people, gay people, liberal people supporting it IS news. That's why it shouldn't have been omitted, and that makes it a lie of omission."
liberalgunowners,ff3xrum,t1_ff3w2jj,1579551175.0,"This is my experience as well. In rural areas, the talk over experienced has been a lot more laughing at how city people don't know where milk comes from, or can't tell a tractor from a combine, or some other rural joke, or frustration about feeling like they're being looked down upon and having their views invalidated. Little of it is as intentionally insulting or disdainful as what urban people seem to inject into every third sentence when talking about farmers.

There is definitely more overt racism in the country, but a lot of it seems to come down to language. City dwellers are more inclined to use the accepted language, but when it comes to thought and action, I'm not sure. It seems to come down more to political differences, in my experience. The more red rural people get upset at what they feel is extra help going towards minorities who should just pick themselves up by their bootstraps, while the more blue city people think minorities need all the help they can get and the government needs to give them more.

Both views have elements of racism to one degree or another, but I think it's mostly just the differing language, and differing politics, than any significant truth to rural people being incredibly racist and urbanites being exemplary of tolerance.

At worst, rural communities might tend to be maybe 10 years behind the progressive mindset, as a random average. But again, that might just be down to politics."

science,fejuhox,t1_fej8vho,1579186138.0,"Learn about things that help in a pragmatic way. Too often, we pick up feel-good causes and think we're helping, while criticizing people who question.

Plastic straw and plastic bag bans have been popular the last few years, but paper straws and paper bags pollute just as much, or more in some cases. Electric vehicles have a net carbon footprint on par with traditional combustion vehicles (this may be changing now). Hydroelectric reeks havoc on downstream habitats. 

All these sound great when you don't look at then other side, though. Paper is better than plastic, electric is better than gas, water is better than coal. But they become murkier on closer examination. Questioning these things, though, often gets you cast as anti-environment, and people ostracize you. Discussion is sidelined in favor of feeling good.

It has real world consequences, too. Nuclear power has much lower cancer rates, much lower failure rates, and much less widespread detrimental effect than coal, and can easily produce enough power, at all hours and all conditions, to meet energy demands, unlike modern renewables. Nuclear was on the rise for decades until Three Mile Island (not a meltdown) and Chernobyl (a meltdown). People, encouraged by vehemently anti-nuclear organization Greenpeace, turned against it.

We could have avoided climate change. We could have been fine by now. But fear mongering groups, including well-meaning environmental groups, undermined that, and here we are. And still they won't support nuclear, even as they shake in fear that the world is burning down.

The best advice, not only for the environment but for all of politics and life, is to not give in to the narrative. Whatever side you're on, and however good and well-meaning the people you support, don't just listen to what they say and accept it. Always question. Always look for pragmatic solutions. Sometimes they don't sound nice. Sometimes they don't make you feel good. Sometimes people won't want to hear them. 

If you want to really help make the world better, you can't afford to be an idealist. You have to be a realist. You have to be pragmatic. The world needs more people like that, but it will never be something society acknowledges it needs."

What we really need, more than anything, is for someone or some group to seriously study the various cost aspects and determine where the price inefficiencies are, what the various trade-offs of fixing those inefficiencies would be, and how it could be done in a way that would benefit more people without undermining things like the medical research and technological innovation we already lead the world in."
