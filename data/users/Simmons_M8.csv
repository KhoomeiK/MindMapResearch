religion,ffetm8m,t3_esymop,1579864949.0,Glad the Church of England has a spine after all. The most important teaching in Christianity - love your neighbour and love your God more. A true expression of that teaching does not lie in throwing your religion out the window because secular liberalism guilts for not doing so.

religion,fdpic0j,t1_fdp9p3i,1578629403.0,"You read the Bible back to front and yet your points rely on being unaware that He was God incarnate in the flesh of a man (John 1:1, 1:14) and that He lived for the express purpose of being murdered...

*Assuming the Bible tells the truth* (permit me this assumption for the sake of argument, you yourself seem to consent to the idea by citing your apparent bible knowledge as supporting your case), does an infinitely complex, eternal, all-knowledgeable, complex, prehistoric, timeless (an everlasting instant so to speak) metaphysical, transcendent entity seem like the white picket fence type? Then compounded with the biblical narrative that again, His express purpose on earth was His death and resurrection into the kingdom of God that He preached?

And since you've been so patient to read that perspective which you don't sympathize with - let's now assume what you most likely believe to be true; let's say my religion of which I've dedicated my life is false, all fibs and tall tales. In such a case I can only say, in keeping with 1 Corinthians 15:12-22 - it would be irrelevant to me. It would be such a tragedy that 'Jesus' wasn't *Jesus* that it wouldn't matter if 'Jesus' existed or not, nor if he was married or not, or even if he was a poof. He wouldn't matter, he would be a nobody to me, as he'd pale in comparison to the God I retained.

This is the sad reality of conversations like these, they can only go so far before hitting an impasse, and devolving into a debate about God's existence and the validity of Christianity.

Thanks for taking the time out.

Postscript - *""Catholics argue Mary only had 1 child (Jesus) when most historians agree she had multiple children and some of them were even early Christian leaders. In such a world there is much room for us to rely on our knowledge of the culture and trends of the time.""*

I'm not Catholic, I don't have a dog in this fight. Historians don't agree, they wildly speculate on this. The bible seems to imply she had other children, though they aren't mentioned or recorded more than implicated. Maybe she really did stay a virgin forever and had no other children. It matters little unless you're the type to pray the rosary and stress the importance of her perpetual virginity. As you said *""Lack of information does not mean that we can dismiss an opinion""*"
religion,fdp8tik,t1_fdp6qpv,1578622693.0,"Well, I'm working according to the Bible. If you're not a Christian then that's fine, but you're the one proposing a non-sequitur in saying ""He was probably married"" when all known sources on Him imply otherwise.

According to these sources, Christian, Jewish, and Gentile, He was either God incarnate (an implausible idea to the atheist) or He was, as I said, a crazy homeless doomsday cult leader followed by a band of males. Neither strikes me as a marrying type. People who knew Him and lived after His crucifixion made no mention of a wife or a widow. It does not follow to make such assumptions for the sake of proposing new ideas.

Or alternatively, He didn't exist and we made Him up to trick people into... something... for some reason."

He wasn’t caught in the assassination, the previous king, Elystan the magnanimous died of ‘suspicious circumstances’. I only know it was Bedwyr that killed him because when I died and became him, I got the message noting the successful assassination - so I got the messages about the murder from both perspectives. 

I was sorta angry but not really, I liked that previous character but he was getting old and had no sons, plus who was I supposed to take revenge on? Myself? Bedwyr turned out to be a good king himself and despite inheriting the throne in his thirties, he went on to rule until his 90’s."

I think modern Christianity, both conservative and liberal alike, are guilty of “de-sinning” sins as of late, in keeping with ‘the times’ and the changing culture rather than our unchanging creed. 

The reason for this is because we’re immersed in, and amending ourselves to a secular culture that cares little for Christ."

Honestly, I think traditionalism is what attracts the young to religious faith, I think liberal strands will be the very first to be extinguished, they lack conviction and succor. They become identical to atheists in their social views and so religion loses all its appeal in the first place.

I should note I'm not evangelical.

Also, keeping your religion becomes redundant if you have to throw out the parts you don't like, despite having little theological justification for doing so, and rather conform to the judgment of non-believers and their pretty words. ""Bigot"" is the new ""heretic"". We are the light of the world, not the other way around."

First off I think you'll find that far from 'almost every other government on earth' puts its own citizenry in re-education camps. It tends to be quite taboo these days you see. Secondly, It's a bit of a contradictory statement to say *""they aren’t cracking down on religion they are cracking down on any challenge to the government""* when that challenge happens to be the free exercise of religion. It's kinda like saying *""we aren't cracking down on red we're just cracking down on everything that isn't blue""*"
religion,fcliz0n,t3_ehisfn,1577748893.0,"I had a strong disdain for religion, that I have one now came to me as a shock more than anyone. 

To me, it's that God is the basis, source of and definition of the objective concepts of goodness and justice. By my sins I have abandoned right and claim to heaven above (for the wages of sin is death), in spite of this I have eternal salvation because God came incarnate as man, then bled and died for me. That is, me, and anyone else that would seek Him out. 

Mercy and compassion in addition to perfect justice, that's what I think is the best part - redemption."
