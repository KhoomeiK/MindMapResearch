fantasywriters,fezzbd5,t3_er0zsq,1579463479.0,What would happen to people who pay someone to kill someone or something ? What happens to someone who kills an animal ? Someone who eats an animal ? Someone who buy an object made through slavery ? What if someone buys something from someone who use the money they get to do bad things ? Or someone who buys an object when the seller makes huge benefits when the person who crafted it was exploited ?What about someone who doesn’t pay their taxes ? Someone who eats a plant made by using pesticids therefore killing small animals or insects ?

My comment was relevant to bibo’s case specifically, someone died and people who were even remotely involved are messed up. Most of the people who worked with bibo don’t get royalties for the movies and still need to work every day so I don’t think they care


To be more general, the budget for the movie won’t stop existing if one of the worker goes to jail (even more in animation) people will continue finding jobs and getting paid as long as entertainments are needed and paid for
Bibo was working on charlotte, he was removed from the project but the project will still be produced and realeased


Maybe there should be a clause for important people working on movies saying if they tarnish the integrity of a studio or a movie they need to pay to compensate anyone who would get a cut on their royalties because of their actions

Sorry if anything of the sort happened to you though"
