The meaning of country music has changed over the years, too. Jason Aldean or something would scarcely be recognizable as country music 50-60 years ago.

All too often nowadays, popular country songs seem to be completely lacking in traditional ornamentation, chord changes, things like shuffles and swing feel, and instead just add fiddle and drawl to an otherwise pop/rock song. Add some rural lyrics to a Katy Perry song, change the instrumentation to guitar/bass/drums/pedal steel, and get a guy with a twangy voice to sing it, and you can make the country charts.

It's really a fascinating issue, especially with the Old Town Road controversy, and people like Taylor Swift who used to straddle the line but now go firmly pop. It's really an interesting time for Country music.
