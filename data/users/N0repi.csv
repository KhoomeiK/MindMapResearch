bloodborne,ffb604x,t1_ffaddld,1579752714.0,That's one of my favorite tracks as well! I think it's the most epic SoulsBorne song. A fitting end to The Ringed City and the Dark Souls Trilogy.
bloodborne,ff9xsxy,t1_ff9ms6d,1579723825.0,"Agreed. SoulsBorne games aren't flooded with music, so when music is used, it indicates something significant is happening. The live orchestra emphasizes the significance."

socialism,fe0je5y,t3_enkdov,1578814340.0,"The results are unfortunate. Though I would like to point out that when typing ""how can people"" the recommendations are individualist, again. The term ""we"" is pretty vague and not exclusive to socialism. We are weak as individuals, but strong as people."

bloodborne,fddkh83,t3_ektczw,1578315772.0,Fake Iosefka. Not sure if this counts because she isn't a regular enemy.
bloodborne,fcmo4y4,t3_ei0iod,1577783852.0,"DS3 was my first Soulsborne game, and I can relate a lot. DS3 has some of the creepiest sounds I've ever heard. The sounds combined with my conservative playstyle made the game feel slow. Totally different story when I played Dark Souls PTDE afterwards. My extremely cautious playstyle came back in DS2 SOTFS because a lot of the game felt unfair; a gank. By the time I played Bloodborne I was pretty aggressive."
