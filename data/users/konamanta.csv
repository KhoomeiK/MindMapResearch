If so than historians assume that Ceasers head was somewhat deformed and unusually wide at the head. Which was common deformation back than depending how they we birthed.

My biggest thing with her is her being incredibly inauthentic. And I feel this way about anyone on both sides of the aisle.
She is not a Bronx girl. She was born there and grew up in a affluent neighborhood. Her father was upper middle class. She went through adversity when her father passed and I respect that and all. But she is fake as hell
 She went to a prestigious college, I joined the Army at 18 to help pay for college cause I knew my parents wouldnt pay for mine.

I'm not convinced Trump is racist despite all of this. He targets Latinos in particular because they by far exceed anyone else in illegal immigration. Despite what your facebook meme wants you to brlieve. Trump seems to be distasteful in everything. The asshole way hes dealing with immigration is no different from the way he dealt with Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush Chris Christie or anyone else who disagreed with him."
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fd4b67c,t1_fd3zpsd,1578165999.0,"I wouldnt jump to that. Read that link. I think Trump shouldn't address the Mexicans so disgustingly. Those 600000 is a combination between 3 regions, Europe, Canada and Oceania to account all together for 5 percent of undocumented immigrant. Latinos between Mexico, Central America and South America account for 73 percent of illegal immigrants. I think Trump needs tact in general, but he like Obama and Bush were not wrong to put a particular focus on Latin Americans. Who accounted for 8 million out of 11 million undocumented workers. I think presenting that 600,000 figure by itself is very misleading."

MapPorn,fd3s51o,t3_ejq33w,1578161215.0,I'm having a hard time with your definition of freedom of the press. Apart from the news we also have journalists and less prominent forms of media. Regardless my understanding about freedom of the press is when the government steps in a prevents you from reporting information. News stations reporting opinions no matter how few there are isnt suppression of the freedom. If any thing the fact we have polar opposite news channels like fox and MSNBC.
