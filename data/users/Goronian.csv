fatlogic,ff39pav,t1_feuippu,1579536973.0,He's also way over average height and BMI stops working properly for people this tall. Not to mention his joints will be just gone if he keeps that weight up.
fatlogic,ff378b7,t1_feznssh,1579535346.0,"~70% of America is overweight, compared ti the exceedingly low number of underweight people.

Even here in Russia the average BMI is 27. Last time we had a serious starvation situation in the West, it was called Holodomor."

I can scarf down an absolutely ungodly amount of maki in a day. Easily over a pound."

fatlogic,ff30mf8,t1_ff2zqkw,1579530480.0,"""There is no concrete evidence that links sugar with an addiction/withdrawal system in humans currently, but studies using rats suggest the possibility.""

From your very article.

Rats are not humans. Remember the study about the dangers of aspartame? One study, also done on rats, couldn't be replicated, thrown out by actual scientists but still peddled to this day."

Ice-cream is already one of the lowest-calorie sweet snacks, averaging only about 200 cal per 100 ml. Contrast that with the typical 450 per 100 gram of chocolate. Your recipe sounds delicious and a great way to save money, but it's not going to save you a lot of calories in the long run and is not that much more healthy.

This sub is obsessed with this really trendy idea of healthy eating sometimes, to the point we shame everyone who says to look at anything not perfectly healthy. We're here to bust weight loss myths, we don't do that by spreading even more."
fatlogic,ff2zdp9,t1_ff2xh3k,1579529440.0,"It's absolutely not healthy, but can we please stop labeling it as addictive? Anything that releases dopamine the brain can be addictive if the person is suspectible to it: sugar, videogames, working out, skydiving, social media or community church service. Most people do not have this reaction and it's in bad taste to even place it in the same ballpark as real chemical addiction like drugs or alcohol."
fatlogic,ff2yz99,t1_ff2yntz,1579529095.0,"And since bananas, milk, honey, avocado and nuts are all calorie-heavy it has about as much calories per serving as regular ice cream.

Eat whatever you want, just know moderation."
