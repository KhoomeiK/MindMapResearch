FighterJets,ffiruei,t1_ffi261f,1579981134.0,"The operational ceiling of an F-15 is quoted as 20 km. In this test, the missile was released at an altitude of 11.5 kms.

The satellite destroyed by the missile in the photo was at an altitude of 550 km.

The ISS orbits at 330 - 400 km (its orbit decays and is periodically boosted).

No matter how you cut it, there's still a huge distance of a few hundred kilometres (or miles) to cover, whether you're targeting the ISS or a satellite in LEO. That distance is bridged by the engine on the missile.

So no, you won't be launching an astronaut from an F-15, short of strapping a rocket booster to him or her (which has massive safety issues in itself!)"

You'll have to manually release it from a TP by reducing the quantity held in the TP. When you reduce that quantity, your traders will move the resource out from the TP into a market/barn/stockpile, and only then can your 'Bannies' utilize that resource.

This is sometimes a useful behavior. If you want to throttle the usage of a resource, it helps to store surplus in a TP. For instance, if you prefer smithing steel tools (requires coal + iron), you'll notice that citizens will take the coal for heating homes. To ensure that citizens use firewood as far as possible, you can move all coal into a TP, and periodically release 6 units of coal when a blacksmith requires it. Of course, this level of micro might seem a bit inappropriate for a Banished playstyle, but it's more an illustration of how trading posts can be used to segregate resources.

Likewise, you can build a TP in a place inaccessible to a trader, and use it purely for longer-term storage. For instance, if you have a large number of a particular resource being produced (e.g. tons of beef/mutton), you can periodically move it out from barns to such a TP, so that the barns in the vicinity of the pastures are free for use."

FighterJets,ffhycg0,t1_ffhxhy2,1579959145.0,"The stated reason for that launch ([Operation Burnt Frost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Burnt_Frost)) was that the targeted satellite was from a failed launch, slowly falling from orbit, and was full of hazardous maneuvering fuel (hydrazine) which posed a threat if it came down in/over a populated area. So it wasn't called a ""test"", it was more of a ""safety-related"" activity, which involved blowing up the satellite and thereby burning up the fuel. 

Whether or not that was true, or was [a convenient cover](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7248995.stm), I'm sure that they nevertheless gathered a lot of useful instrumentation and data from a live launch, particularly since many nations are now focused on such ASAT missiles launched from the surface and not air."
