AskReddit,fdp7p0q,t1_fdow128,1578621933.0,"I get this 100%. It annoys me to no end how every media story is premised on an aka ""clickbate"" one-liner. This is what Republicans call ""fake news"", and I get it. When you actually read or watch the source it's never as egregious as the media makes it out to be. Pointing it out on Reddit just gets you downvoted into oblivion for not giving in to the circke-jerk status quo.

With that said, I still believe Trump is a total moron and has done irreparable harm to the US. But I totally understand how frustrating it is to hear the media exaggerating these things to try and make Trump look bad. From my point of view the things he does are *already* bad enough, but then you have the media come out and blow the smallest sound bytes completely out of proportion and context. It actually takes away from the substance, IMO, and only helps further the ""fake news"" Republican talking points.

But, voting for a moron specifically because other morons bend facts to try and make aforementioned moron look bad, and not because of his policies or values, still makes you a moron."

From Wikipedia-
>CinemaScore describes itself as ""the industry leader in measuring movie appeal"".[9] There are 35 to 45 teams of CinemaScore representatives present in 25 large cities across North America. Each Friday, representatives in five randomly chosen cities give opening-day audiences a small survey card.[10][11][12] The card asks for age, gender, a grade for the film (A, B, C, D or F), whether they would rent or buy the film on DVD or Blu-ray, and why they chose the film.[11] CinemaScore typically receives about 400 cards per film;[13] the company estimates a 65% response rate and 6% margin of error.[12]

From their own site-
>CinemaScoreÂ® is the industry leader in measuring movie appeal among theatre audiences. Since 1978, CinemaScore has been polling moviegoers at major movie releases on opening night to collect demographic information and calculate a distinctive CinemaScore grade.


So your statement that 
>Cinemascore is a prediction of how financially well a movie will do based on a broad appeal to mass audiences

is kind of misleading. Fact is, people who saw the movie were polled, and that's where this rating came from."

I was feeling super depressed one night so I drank a bunch and took several pills of a perscribed antihistamine that is also a mild anti-anxiety medication. I told the lady from the Suicide Hotline this and she immediately said she had to call the cops because I admitted to ""abusing"" a perscription medication. 

Cops get there and I try to assure them I'm ok, that I was just in a very bad place and the medication I took can be used for anti-anxiety even though it's perscribed to me for allergies. They didn't care. ""You abused a pharmaceutical drug"". They told me I could either voluntarily get in an ambulance or be arrested and then force-hospitalized. I ""voluntarily"" got in, went to ER where they did literally nothing except monitor me, and then in the morning they Baker-Acted me and had me admitted to a psychiatric hospital.

I tell people all the time- if you're a relatively sane person, psychiatric hospitals are the worst place in the world. If I wasn't entirely depressed going in, I was DEFINITELY depressed coming out. If you want to witness medical professionals give close to zero fucks about patents step into a psychiatric hospital. It was like a circus of the mentally unstable. I watched a girl get raped (all but physically penetrated) after repeatedly warning the staff about a large male that was continually harassing her. They then shot him up with a cocktail of drugs that essentially made him a walking zombie for 24 hours and let him back out.  In my 30 years of life I've never been in a more fucked up place than a psychiatric hospital.
