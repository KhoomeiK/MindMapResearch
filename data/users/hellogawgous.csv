YouOnLifetime,ffa0hsy,t1_ff9y82m,1579725405.0,I can't. I'm gaining a lot of weight since being on an SSRI and I'm disabled so extra lbs aren't good for me. Not for vanity I just need to lose weight. I'm not completely cutting them out but limiting a lot. I used to basically eat nothing but carbs and junk all day.

MultipleSclerosis,ff5xb7p,t3_erta7n,1579613333.0,"I loved my Subaru outback. It was the perfect height to get in and out of. Just low enough I could easily sit without having to pull myself in but high enough that I could easily stand to get out and back in the chair.

DiagnoseMe,ff1fqm7,t3_er3vun,1579478514.0,Put a cold pack on it and take some ibproufin. I fell super hard on my ribs once and it hurt to breath. I went and got an x-ray buy I was fine. So I think if your pain is a 3 they could just be bruised. Take it easy for the rest of the day and take see ibproufin to help reduce swelling. If it starts to hurt any more or you have trouble breathing you can check for a fracture but even then they can't do much. Ribs are tricky. Good luck
