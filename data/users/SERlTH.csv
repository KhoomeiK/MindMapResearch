I’ve dealt with two stalking incidents; one years ago that was taken care of by my boss at the time (got the guy a restraining order on our store for posting creepy ""missed connection"" adds about me), and the second -more recent- I had security get involved. laws may be different where you live, but in my case in order to have legal standing, I had to actually tell the guy to leave me alone before it could be dealt with. they did escort me for this part of course (as support and also to document it happened) …didn’t stop the guy, but this is the point where police can step in and act. so if your stalker continues to harass you, don’t engage. just save all the evidence you can and report it."

I know you want to help, but you're assuming you CAN help. it's clearly upsetting her to talk about it, so getting information would be more for you than her. things is, you can still support her without the gritty details. just gently ask what she needs and grant her whatever you can. let that be enough.

she'll tell you if/when she is ready, and that may never come. that's okay, and I strongly suggest coming to peace with that. I get that it hurts when people you love withhold information, but I promise this is more about her than you."

as a white person, I’m disappointed so many of us are denying responsibility of stuff like this, but we love playing victim when folks call us out on racism. It’s dismissive to tell minorities to walk away from rude people like her, but that just permits her behaviour.
