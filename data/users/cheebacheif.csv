microgrowery,fc6gtob,t3_egc93x,1577480245.0,I‚Äôm sorry but this strain/bud is terrible. I‚Äôve worked in the cannabis industry for a decade now and yea it ‚Äúmight‚Äù be a landrace but in no way is this a superior bud. The airy aspect means that it‚Äôs stressed and not enough co2. Nobody would everrrr grow this strain on a commercial scale for so many reasons. To people that think this thing is rad I‚Äôm sorry. Mids.
