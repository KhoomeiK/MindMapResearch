depression_help,fdrtbkg,t3_emoa3r,1578689471.0,"Everyone with depression is different. Depression is more like a spectrum of disorders, rather than a specific one. There are high-functioning people, there are low-functioning people. Because of that, it's quite difficult to give advice since I have no idea how this person is. However, no matter what kind of depression it is, mild to severe, she *should* seek help, because even if it is just mild, it can take a turn for the worse.

However, if she doesn't want to go to therapy, I don't think you should push her. Just make sure that she knows that you're there for her because that can mean a lot, and thus make the depression more bearable.

If it's just the therapy that she doesn't want to go to, there is of course still medication, but I can guess that she wants neither of them because she doesn't want to make a ruckus out of it. I was the same, but years of keeping the depression for myself led to a mental breakdown a few years ago, so I was kind of forced into psychiatric help."
