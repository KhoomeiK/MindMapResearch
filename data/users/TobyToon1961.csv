Years ago, I could meet someone and they actually wanted to get to know u as a person and spend time doing things like going to the beach, going on picnics at the park, etc.  Nowadays, it's like they want to hop straight into the bed on the 1st frickin' date (no dinner, no lunch, no movie to go watch) - just interested in getting their quick selfish jollies for themselves.  It's like wanting to go straight for the dessert in a meal and skip the main course.  It's disgusting.  I've become VERY selective as to who I let into my world because of it.  We ARE human beings too w/feelings - believe it or not - not a frickin' piece of meat for some guy's enjoyment.   I've dealt w/flaky people too - no common decency or respect for other people's time.  People need to get out of their ""it's all about me"" bubble and think for a nanosecond that there's other people outside of their selfish world they're affecting."

It seems that everyone has their place in the family, and if I try to make waves to make people address their bad behavior, they minimize it and shove it under the rug.  I got sick of it and discarded them from my life.  I still miss my mom, and she's the only one I care about to talk to because she was the rock that held my family together growing up.  The rest of them are worthless, greed-driven selfish people I can do without."

offmychest,ferh4it,t3_eqf9br,1579353786.0,"I know how you feel.  I've been there myself.  Here's my 2 cents:  Maybe you're looking in the wrong places for people who truly care about you.  It took me a while to piece that together in life.  Tap into what your passions are in life (i.e. hiking, tennis or whatever it might be) and look for people with similar interests.  If you just be yourself doing what you like, something will fall into place when you least expect it.  I know it sounds cliche, but it's true.  When I have tried too hard, it seems like nothing fell into place.  When I let go and didn't have expectations, that's when I seemed to have better luck in good people coming into my path."
offmychest,fep7za4,t3_eq9v2a,1579314176.0,"I know how you feel.  I lost my dog years ago, and it felt like someone ripped my heart out.  It came out of the clear blue with no warning.  He was like a family member and losing a child.  For the longest time, I couldn't bring myself to look at his picture.  People tell me I should just get another pet, but I don't think I could live with going thru that again.  It was too painful."
offmychest,fep63rs,t3_eq5kwm,1579312968.0,"I hate to tell you this, but it seems like when men reach the age of 40, something kicks in where they want to ""recreate their youth"".  Anything and anyone that gets in the way is not even thought about.  All they care about is what they want THEIR way.  They don't think about the wife who stuck by them.  They don't think about the kids left behind.  They chase young girls that are naive.  They throw money around, and of course, some young girl thinks it's the best thing since sliced bread.  The truth is disgusting and raw.  Sadly, this country has become a place for instant gratification and to hell with who you abuse along the way."
