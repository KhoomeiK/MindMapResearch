Then I started watching [Paul Sellers videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCYjoj6cfno) on youtube and his ethos really resonated with me. He's like the Bob Ross of wood working.  His basic premise is that machines can have their place (mainly preparing the lumber), but there is a lot to be gained by hand tools: safety, practicality, and more rewarding. You can find old tools at flea markets and restore them. There are cheaper alternatives to the newest fancy tools. For example, showing how to sharpen chisels on sandpaper as opposed to pricey diamond plates."

Then he gave us writing assignments.

But here's the shocker. He would return the assignments with just the grade. No comments. No red marks. No general discussions of how the class did. Just ""75%"" written at the top of the assignment or whatever he apparently felt like.  We petitioned that he tell us why we received mark downs and his response was, ""well I told you what the requirements were for the paper, so you should be able to figure out what you did wrong"" 

Pretty sure he had some mental health issues and he was just randomly writing grades on the papers. That doesn't make him a bad person, but he was a bad teacher. 

If professors don't count it would be my jr high art teacher. Now usually when you think art teacher you're thinking of some hippy type, but not this guy. He was a complete, narcissistic asshole. He spent a good bit of time talking about how great of an artist he was, and showing off his masterpieces. My friend was having a tough time at home, and wasn't very performing very well in school. Instead of trying to understand him, he berated him as lazy. He said, ""whats the matter <student name>, just don't give a shit?"" Also the town had a contest to design a bumper sticker for the towns 100th anniversary. As the last  assignment for the year, we designed bumper stickers for the contest. Suprisingly, I won!
