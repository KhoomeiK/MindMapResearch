therewasanattempt,ffgzhic,t1_ffgx5bn,1579919067.0,Racial diversity in a given area. If that area is predominantly black or Spanish yet the precinct was 100% white I would suspect a racist disposition. I doubt that’s the case here
therewasanattempt,ffgnp57,t1_ffghhz6,1579910500.0,"The racial disparity in some fire departments comes down to statistics. Your reading comprehension is apparently lacking. In simpler terms, race or gender shouldn’t make a difference when making hiring decisions, or most any decision for that matter."
therewasanattempt,ffggwk4,t1_ffgewbs,1579905966.0,Ok so that’s a completely different argument. Are you saying everyone should get skills or qualifications for free? What’s the difference between a white man in poverty and a minority in poverty?

therewasanattempt,ffggc1i,t1_ffgb188,1579905598.0,Very insightful comment.  I like the part where you said you found one. Absolutely profound
therewasanattempt,ffgg7ch,t1_ffg9ndx,1579905513.0,Let’s hire people who are skilled and qualified instead of blindly hiring white men or women or minorities.
therewasanattempt,ffgemhc,t1_ffg5mdf,1579904519.0,The fact that some businesses hire people based solely on the fact that they are not a white male is a huge red flag. I’ve been told by friends that they were hired simply because they were a woman/minority.
