stopdrinking,ff6n69e,t1_ff65020,1579630764.0,"Haha I see. I'm only starting out (for the Nth time), and it's been helpful to me during temptations to remember that *an evening of acetone fun costs several days of physical recovery / bloating*, then go distract myself with something. Still, I have never surpassed 3 months, it has been my sobriety length limit for about a decade.

Thanks for explaining.

Edit: 10 years, huh"
stopdrinking,ff5ns40,t1_ff50xze,1579602217.0,"Awesome, this gives me hope. Of course my question sounded a little silly, it all depends on circumstances / genetics, but I'm kind of desperate :) 2-3 months of successful sobriety before eventual relapse, it's maddening."

stopdrinking,ff5nhs3,t1_ff5bc2h,1579601779.0,"This gives me hope. Still, as OP pointed out, it takes upkeep like a 12-steps program, and me, knowing my history, I will try it this time. 6 months gives me hope though, thx."
stopdrinking,ff4y1fe,t1_ff4x4rm,1579575188.0,"Thanks, I see. Yeah, usually just reading a book isn't enough for something like this. In my previous attempts, as soon as the reasons I decided to quit started to get faded by the distance, I relapsed, 2-3 months tops."
stopdrinking,ff4u5c1,t1_ff4qba7,1579572511.0,"Yeah, that's where I got that from. She mentions a liminal point like that."
stopdrinking,ff4jq8q,t3_erk7t2,1579565277.0,"I read that at a point it goes from ""crap, I can't drink anymore"" to ""whew, I don't have to drink ever again"". Did you notice this, and if so, around when, 1-2 years?"
stopdrinking,ff2yx5e,t3_er62xe,1579529045.0,"> It was the only time I was forced to stay in bed all day, eat pizza, and  watch a movie or something. Like being a kid again home sick from  school. 

And you feel guilty and lethargic if you try to spend a day like that, now that you're sober? I can identify with this 100%, this genius to point out, I think it's why I binged on weekends for so long. It's like a really expensive anesthetic (capt. Obvious here), I think the trick is to find something to do that I enjoy, that I can't wait for the weekend. Not the booze-movies-vidya-takeout."

I want to try android development myself.

For now I do databases, and usually no one is supportive or helpful. Coworkers hide information from you, prevent you from even touching what they are working on. I guess that's any industry in IT, not just databases, but I've only done databases though. If you want them to be even more insecure, get certified. Then you will be viewed as hostile competition, behind all the smiles and lunch option discussions."

stopdrinking,fe6oi8l,t3_enpcx9,1578898203.0,"It's over-simplifying, I think. This ""how much time have I wasted"". Cut yourself some slack. You needed an anesthetic, you drank it. 

The world is hideous even without the anesthetic, we keep finding these mindful meditation techniques to deal with it."

I don't seek counseling, it doesn't make sense in my case, an injustice had been inflicted upon me as a kid, I'm justly mad about it, trying to find a way how to not get angry every time someone mentions childhood things."
