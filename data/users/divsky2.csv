I guess in this case the vigilante was a chicken so I can't really find any fault in the chicken's actions, but I do find it upsetting to see so many redditors falling over themselves to praise acts of violence.

Yesterday for example there was a huge circlejerk of people worshipping and praising a dad who straight up tackled a child at a school wrestling match because that child had accidentally used an illegal wrestling move against another child. It was really disgusting to me. You could go to /r/justiceserved right now and find dozens of threads being upvoted that's just people fighting and assaulting other people because the other person ""deserved it"".

I don't like it so I kind of get where this guy's mindset is coming from. I don't think acts of violence should be praised no matter how much we think the other person deserves it. We're civilized people and we have an actual justice system."
