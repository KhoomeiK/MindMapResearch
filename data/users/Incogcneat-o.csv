He's a former professional athlete who looks like a movie star to the point where he gets stopped on a regular basis to ask for selfies by people who think he's famous.

Not all of us were fortunate enough to grow up with feminist ideas and role models, and internalized misogyny runs deeeeep, especially for those of us who have benefited within the patriarchal system without realizing how much it has hurt us.

AskWomenOver30,ffhmw7x,t1_ffhjxfs,1579942984.0,"Ah, okay, I think there's a disconnect between what you're describing and a nemesis. So thanks for letting me clear up the difference!

Fairytales tend to be about the hero's journey, triumph in the face of adversity, and achieving a ""prize"" (usually a handsome prince when it comes to female-centric stories) while stories involving nemeses tend to be about the restoration of equilibrium. 

Nemeses are inherently equal in power, since one of the things that defined Nemesis the goddess was restoring and maintaining balance. 

Contrast that to fairytale villains who as a rule tend to be in a position of power over the protagonist. It's an entirely different story structure. Still great and totally worth analyzing; just different. 

Another big difference is nemeses aren't inherently good or evil; while there's a strong protagonist/antagonist element to fairytales, especially as they've been disneyfied and streamlined for the sake of narration

In many countries, especially in Latin America, Némesis/Nemesia has been a popular name for girls for hundreds (probably thousands) of years. I have some great aunts way back when who were twins named Prudencia and Nemesia. 

Bringing it away from the fantastic and back into the mundane, it's perhaps easiest to think of it as chess. There's no good guy or bad guy; just two equal sides with equal but opposing goals.

That's why I say the woman in the original letter doesn't have a nemesis, and the people that you mention looking down on aren't your nemeses. There's not really jealousy at play between nemeses because you two are evenly matched.

In my particular case, my nemesis is 50+ years older than I am and has been extraordinarily cruel since I was a child, but she wasn't my nemesis when I was a child because I wasn't her equal. She was more a fairytale villain of the ""False Donor"" variety (basically the Evil Queen archetype).

It wasn't until we became equals that we became nemeses. I am the only person who can stand up to her and get her to back down, and she's the same with me. There's something really grounding in that and I will miss her desperately when she's gone. 

The Ancient Greeks knew humans need balance to be happy, and that unchecked ability ends in hubris. That's why they gave us the idea of hubris and the personification of Nemesis."

WitchesVsPatriarchy,ffhepgi,t3_etmj3t,1579932168.0,"Couple of things:

A lot of folk magics don't come from written traditions. Whether it's because written language wasn't prioritized, or literacy was straight up illegal during formative periods, writing things down in an accessible, instructional manner just wasn't on the top of the to-do list.

Having knowledge passed down orally is a way to protect yourself, your community, and your traditions. White men, especially white men with access to education and connections to make publishing and distribution easy, have historically been the only people who have had that Hall Pass for practicing the occult and having it be taken as science or art, not silly backwards superstition or worse.

Another aspect is a lot of English speakers speak ONLY English, which means they're missing out on small publishers in Latin America or other predominantly non-white regions.

My nemesis is in hospice right now and I'm going to be like Sherlock without Moriarty (or Moriarty without Sherlock) when she finally dies and assumes her rightful place on the Throne of Hell.

A good nemesis is a mirror that shows you your best and worst self, simultaneously. She is your most worthy adversary, and you are hers. You get and respect each other in a way no one else does. It's a beautiful thing if you're up for it and one of the few pure relationships on this earth.

In my case it comes down to a few things:

One, I *enjoy* dressing well and always have. It feels natural and it's an expression of who I am as a person. If I felt more ""me"" in a pair of leggings and a hoodie, I'd wear that and feel exactly zero guilt about it.

Two, I live a life that allows me to dress well. I don't have kids. I don't have to do intense manual labor at my job or at home unless I wish to do it. I have expendable income and access to good clothes. I'm not going to pretend everyone is in the same situation or should have the same priorities I do.

Three, I get super depressed if I look schlubby.

Maybe I'm vain or maybe I'm sensitive (hint: it's both) but if I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror and I don't look nicely put together, it's really easy for any negative feelings I might be having at the moment to snowball to the point where I actually become depressed. Not so much because I value my looks above all else, but that it means I've stopped doing something I enjoy and that's not a great sign for me. It took me longer than it should've to realize this about myself, so for me dressing well is literally self-care."

What works for us is he knows the names and basics of my other lovers, just as he would know the names of, say, my friends from work. Other than that he'd rather not know the details.
 ""I'm going to have lunch with ____ on Thursday"" could mean we're just having lunch or it could mean I'm getting my back blown out. 
We're not into the whole Hot Wife thing, so it's not that he enjoys that I'm with other people, so we spare each other the details. 

When it comes to him having other lovers, the rule is Men Only and be discreet. Personally I'd rather not know more than the minimum, but it's important to him that I give him my approval, so that's what we do.

It's really not that big a deal. We're not swingers or lifestyle anything. It's not a big part of our identities or even our relationship. If anything, it's more a throwback to when having mistresses and paramours was an understood, though discreetly discussed, part of partnered life."

Opening the sexual aspect of a relationship is delicate work and requires a lot of honesty and playing by the rules the two of you establish together. 

My SO and I had been together about 8 years when we decided to open up the sexual aspect of our relationship when we realized we couldn't meet all of each other's sexual needs --he's bisexual, I'm bi but mostly I'm just super high libido-- but still were madly in love with each other and wanted to stay together.

I won't pretend there weren't hurt feelings at first, but absolutely nothing has been as devastating and damaging as when I got a message from some rando on facebook telling me that my man was getting a little too chummy with his boyfriend. That was a year of therapy and a whoooole lot of tears and trauma on both sides. Do you really want that.

It's been a couple years and although I don't think he's had another partner (antidepressants kill his libido) and I have several, we're still very much happy and in love."
