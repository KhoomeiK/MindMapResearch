Has the Space Force actually started the process of being staffed by enlisted and officers and if so are they just pulling from the Air Force ranks? If they are pulling from the Air Force how does that process even work or begin? Volunteer or voluntold? How does the Air Force make up for the lose of personal or do they even bother now that the Space Force is taking over some duties. Boot camp, Air Force trained until they come up with there own program?  What about bases of operation? So many questions."

You’re right about me not being an unlikable prick, I’ve just been soooo used to doing the whole family thing for so long it just got comfortable being at home all the time. The realization that I don’t have many friends is coming to a head now that the kids are getting to an age where they can stay by themselves for a few hours , the wife and I have seemed to slowly go our own ways and I now have time for myself and I have no friends to do stuff with. Guess I need me a hobby. Thanks stranger friend for your kind words."

I think he jumped for every wreck he was in that he knew the train was either going to be fully destroyed, blown up or caught on fire (tanker or propane trucks) or know your going to end up in a really bad position. The last jump messed his back up so much he retired as an engineer and spent the next 20 years with the FRA."

Meet lots of women seen a lot of countries and got the time I needed to figure shit out. I consider all that a win."
