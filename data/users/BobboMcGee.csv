If they call all men heartless shits but my train to school was cancelled because some guy jumped in front of a train to kill himself i couldn't help but feel bad for his fam and mates, rather than going for the ""man way of thinking"" and go ""mate wtf do it somewhere to not fuck over my life"".

Shit's fucked up. I have seen someone shoot themselves in the face with a shotgun. Not nice. Main reason men have the higher death rate is because men go all in like shooting themselves or taking the jump. If gou wanna go ""oh boohoo we have it harder"" then go ahead and level the playing field. I don't care.

Don't mock the men who have killed themselves. Not cool."
