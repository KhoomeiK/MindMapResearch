Future mitigation strategy: You make up some excuse that you have to be somewhere else just before and ask to meet her there (make sure you get your ticket separately, say you think its becasue you might be pushed for time, whatever). It's not that much less of an assholey thing to do thank leaving your friend behind, but itll save you the anxiety and spare the friend the hurt of being abandoned."

My wife had a very risky pregnancy and I was fully aware that during her labour my job was to be her advocate and champion her needs when the medical staff would be focussing on the birth and the baby. As it happens I did have to make a difficult call during the birth for the sake of my wife's health and keeping her calm enough to be able to get through it, and I'm aware that it's possible that a result of that call may be a factor in issues were having with my daughter's early development even three and a half years down the line, but I made the call my wife needed at a time when she couldn't stand up for herself, or else it could have been much worse for her.

Your husband's job in that delivery room was to be your advocate and your champion, and to put you first at a moment when you were vulnerable and couldn't advocate for yourself. He failed and the price he paid was getting pushed out of the room by the nurse who had to step up and do his job for him. It's a shame, especially as there's no do-over for getting it wrong the first time, but it is his own fault for not sticking up for your wishes when you were the most important person in that room. I hope he sees this too, can apologise, and that you can both move on from there, because you need to know he has your back and vice versa, that's what being married is about."
