SuicideWatch,ffdxlhu,t3_esxhxm,1579831443.0,"Like others here there was a lot of strong emotions all at once. Ultimately I was a happy kind of sad. I do enjoy some parts of life, and doing things with my family, but I was more excited and happy to not have to worry about trivial things like school, graduating and deciding what I’m going to do with my life, bills, socializing, etc..

When I think back on it I remember a lot more fear than what I felt in the moment. Probably because I don’t want to die deep down, but I know it’s for the best. 

I thought if I failed I would somehow stop being depressed and get better, but here I am a year later, my sole purpose in life being getting a gun. I can’t wait for that day, so much weight is gonna be lifted off my shoulders once it’s in my hands and I know I have an easy way out. 

(Btw please don’t respond with the typical “shooting your self can mess you up,” I know but guns have over a 90% chance to kill you and it’s good enough for me, I know it’ll kill me anyway)"

People say they want to help and that they’re always there for suicidal people, but then there’s idiots like that who use a “tough love” mentality, which we’ve all heard before many times, and does nothing to help change our outlook. A lot of the ways people try and help us is ironically more hurting than helpful. But everyone just likes to regurgitate what others have said or something that they read somewhere. And not everyone thinks or feels the same way, so one thing might be effective for one person, and then everyone assumes it applies to everybody who deals with the same mental health issues. I agree with what some people on here say, that no one really cares or has time for people like us.

LucidDreaming,ff51ghq,t3_ernqdw,1579577661.0,"The other comment is pretty much spot on, but I still want to say some things.

You can actively imagine a scene you want, or you can just go with whatever images and scenes come to you. Don’t try and force or rusher any part of the WILD process, you have to be passive and present. When things get more real, don’t try and force your way into the image by walking around or doing anything that’s physical. Instead, remember to use your imagination and imagine what it’d be like to touch objects you see. Imagine what it’d be like to smell the cold, autumn air, see the sun shining brightly in your eyes, feel the heat of the sun or the grass or that dog or cat. Don’t try and actually do these things, just keep it in your imagination until it becomes more solid and real. 

With all that said, you may do everything I tell you and fail miserably, and then you will also have times where it works perfectly. WILD is just such a strange experience, and even after you learn it and do it a few times, you’ll never have two of the same experiences. Each time is a little different, sometimes harder or easier, vivid and intense, or murky and dark. Confusing, exciting, weird, awesome..just take it slow. Really learn the method in depth, look at multiple tutorials, videos and articles, read up on other people’s experiences and get excited about it. Be confident about it. And know that a failed WILD attempt is not at all bad, it will actually help you learn it slowly. In my experience I made little milestones, I experienced simple hypnagogia for the first time, seeing a random image, and then after a few times doing that I started getting further, experiencing more vivid images. Eventually I started to notice I was actually inside one of the scenes that came. When you start to hear things, people’s voices, music, the wind or cars in the distance, or anything relating to your senses, you know you’re super close. One day you’ll pop into the dream, sometimes experiences an audible but at the same time not audible pop (sometimes it’s more of a feeling), and you’ll know you did it. 

Soon you’ll start to consistently make it at the doorstep of the dream world, and this part I’ve been stuck on for months. That’s not to say it’ll work out this way for you, but entering the dream tends to be the hardest part for most people to master. I’ve had countless times where I’m very aware and can feel my dream body and touch things in the dream around me, but I’m still somehow not quite in it. Too much movement or emotion can sometimes make me think I’ve woken up, but it’s usually a false awakening. I struggle to realize this most of the time and think I failed and woke up. 

Anyways I feel it’s getting rambly which means I should end this, I know this was long but if you read the whole thing I hope it helps you."
SuicideWatch,ff50c65,t1_ff4y50x,1579576831.0,"Yeah but I’m struggling to leave it. Everyone else (that I’ve heard of) who grow up with religion and realize how terrible it is, they just leave and stop believing, simple as that. 

Meanwhile for me, even after reading through the Bible and seeing how terrible and not so good god is, I still find a part of me wanting to crawl back to him on my hands and knees, and agreeing with him that I’m worthless and disgusting unless I call upon his name.

Sorry there isn’t really any context for anyone else. My thought process here is greatly affected my religion, I’m trying to break away but it’s how I was raised. I’ve also looked into other religions, and they almost always talk about struggles being a part of this life and how they’re not a bad thing, all that ish.

Yes it makes total sense to insult suicidal people and make them feel worse for their decisions, when they already feel like shit themselves and can’t understand how existing helps anyone, even if it does. There’s a much kinder, gentler way to tell people suicide isn’t the answer (even though a lot of the time it really legitimately is). Do you think we don’t focus on all the negative stuff about ourselves? Do you think we don’t know it’s a little selfish? If it’s selfish for us to end our life (our pain and seeing no way out, we’re already suffering here we’re not just doing this because it sounds cool), doesn’t that make it at least a little selfish for others to expect me to keep going to keep them happy? I think either way there’s some selfishness going on, so let’s not use that as a argument for not ending my life. Everyone is selfish about something, even if it’s just a little bit. 

I honestly don’t care what the rest of the post says, it makes me angry and feel worse than I should when people look down on me and call me self obsessed for wanting to stop my pain. Yeah, really selfish for wanting to have a little peace, sorry."

LucidDreaming,ff0bzu4,t3_er1wtu,1579467456.0,"Okay so that other comment is retarded, dream journaling is very useful and helps most people get lucid. However, I’m not saying it’s the number one most important thing to do, whatever the most important thing may or may not be is irrelevant in my mind. The way you get lucid consistently is by doing multiple things, not just one. 

It sounds like you’re doing things right, though I would add one thing: reality checks. If you never question if you’re dreaming, how do you expect to get lucid? You get lucid by getting in the habit of questioning your reality, and then doing reality checks to confirm or deny if you’re dreaming. Though sometimes reality checks may fail, but that’s not because the reality check is bad, usually that means you’re racing through it and not really stopping and questioning if you’re dreaming. So as you start to use reality checks, be sure to not rush them, and don’t just assume you know better and think “I don’t know why I’m doing this, I know I’m awake.” Do you actually know? I, and I’m sure others, have had countless experiences where we’re in a dream and wonder if we’re dreaming, but we confidently answer “No, this is real life I’m awake.” You don’t always truly know, so take note of that. 

Also WILD *can* be trickier for beginners, but meditating regularly will make it way easier to learn how to induce a lucid dream through that method. It’s up to you, but I’d say focus on learning how to lucid dream through DILD, and once you get proficient enough at it, then take a look at WILD. Or if you really want to, learn WILD and get however far you want to with that, and then look at having DILDs."

SuicideWatch,fettdku,t1_fetp0y9,1579379846.0,"I definitely want to go to the gym more. Just like everything else my anxiety and depression stop me, but when I can go it’s nice. I wish I could go that late at night with no one around, because I get so self conscious. I’m one of those weird people who no matter how much I eat I can’t gain weight, I’ve always been super skinny and small. I can eat a bunch of healthy food and gain no weight, I can eat a bunch of unhealthy foods and gain no weight. I’m just stuck where I am, but later in life it’s definitely gonna become a routine for me to go to the gym. 

The job I had to leave was the first job I’ve ever had in my entire life, and it was fun and easy because I got to work with my brother. It may sound strange to some people, but working as a caterer was actually a lot of fun. Most events we worked at were weddings, but there’s always a few other events that a business put together, especially during the holidays. I lost all that because I used to listen to music 24/7, always super loud. It was and still is the only thing that keeps me sane and feeling okay. But I did this so much that I somehow damaged my ears, and now they’re super sensitive to most types of music. I can listen to music a little bit without headphones, but everyone knows music sounds like shit without them, when you’re listening to it through a shitty phone speaker anyway. So now I can’t work at weddings or most events because of the loud music, I was pretty much forced out of my job due to my ears, even though I loved it and it gave me purpose and a good feeling. Now I sit at home all day doing nothing. 

I’ve thought about what I might do after I graduate, but my dad was talking to my brothers and I about getting us some training classes for using guns, so I’m hoping that means in the near future we’ll be doing that and then soon maybe having an actual gun in our home, and then it’ll be time to say goodbye. 

It really sucks though, even now that I understand how painful suicide can be (I lost someone to it not too long ago), I still don’t really care. I know I’m smart enough to go to school and get into a good job, have a fulfilling life and all that..but I’ve just lost the spark most people are born with. Maybe stuff will turn around and give me better reasons to stay, better than my reasons to go. All we can do is hope, but the universe has a track record of ignoring me and whatever I’m going through. So, likely nothing will happen, but that’s okay of course."

It sounds like you got the vibrations which is a common sign you’re on the right track, and then you fell into sleep paralysis, which I think is the ideal time to try and roll out of your physical body (I say “think” because I’m not very experienced with APing, still a noobie). 

Maybe now that you know what you experienced was very normal, you’ll be able to go on with projecting just fine, but if you still have this kind of a reaction to it maybe you should just avoid it. I suggest looking up more info on it, I’m not sure why anyone would try APing without researching it anyway.

SuicideWatch,feilktm,t3_epcc14,1579141373.0,"(TL;DR) - I just needed to vent and let a little out after breaking down and crying for about an hour. Probably should just skip this instead of wasting your time reading this nonsense :)

I really wish I could help and give methods, but 1 I hardly know any myself, and 2 that’s against the rules. 

I think it’s funny that everyone feels pity for us suicidal people, they say they want to help, anything, but the one thing that most of us really want they aren’t willing to help with, or at the very least *allow*. Everyone claims we’re not in the right state of mind, which is true for some people, but for anyone like me, we’ve thought over the idea of suicide for many months, possibly even years or our entire life, and when we contemplate it we think on it long and very deeply. Even if someone didn’t, to me it’s just wrong to dismiss someone’s want or need for death, to throw them into a hospital for a few days and slap them with a hefty bill, only adding to their problems in life and thus adding to their mental health, giving another reason for suicide. 

It’s crazy how much society is starting to talk about doing what makes you happy, live for you and no one else, don’t let anyone try and tell you what to do, but the second suicide enters the picture, it becomes all about who gets affected by the death of whoever is considering suicide. Suddenly no one cares about the person and what they’re struggling through, they want to protect their own needs and wants. 

And I get it, that makes us super selfish and horrible for wanting to die, but it also makes everyone else super selfish for forcing us to stay on this planet, in this terrible life, when really none of us asked for it. Honestly either way, there’s going to be someone who’s apparently “selfish”. I don’t necessarily subscribe to that idea that they have to be the guilty ones, rather it’s just an unfortunate circumstance that they’ve been put in, just like we’re in an unfortunate circumstance right now. 

I do completely agree that life isn’t fair, but that shouldn’t mean we don’t have authority over our own bodies and lives to choose when to quit this life. We don’t owe anyone anything, certainly not our very existence. 

Personally I don’t mean to or want to hurt anyone with my death, it’s just a sad part of life. Those who can handle my death and move on can do that, but no one’s going to get mad if someone else can’t deal with it. Maybe that sounds cold and harsh on my part, but what else could I do? Force myself to live this life, dragging my feet everywhere I go, no motivation or care for this world, work super hard and pay taxes and bills, put up this whole facade, acting like I have a normal and great life and feeling like an emotional knife is burrowing through me because I can’t stand or comprehend living another moment, mentally begging and pleading for death, spending all my mental energies away from this earth, just to keep someone else decently happy? Would my loved ones rather have me exist like that, or think about the fact that I’m much more happy in death and all the burdens of this world being lifted from my shoulders? (Unless you got religious parents like mine, who believe we’re better off here than death because if I kill myself it’s a sin and down to hell I go, but obviously that’s a whole separate issue). Or would my loved ones rather me continue living as I mentioned, just so they can sleep a little easier at night, go on with their lives and act as if everything’s just perfect, when it’s not for the one they claim to care for so much. 

I’m not saying there’s right or wrong exactly, it really depends on each person and what they’re facing in life, and what their mental state is. I suppose you could debate with someone for hours on whether most people who committed suicide could’ve realistic stuck it out and avoided causing pain to others. But still. The whole idea gives me the feeling that when suicide is involved, everyone else’s comfort matters more than the person who was so miserable went as far as to end their life. It feels a lot like judging them and looking down on them for being so weak and pathetic, even though just yesterday when that person was alive everyone was saying how strong they were for sticking with it. I guess you’re either impressively strong or laughably weak and small. Can there be an in between, is there? 

Anyway, I just shot all this out of my brain, having a really shitty night thinking about how I can’t have the one thing I want more than anything. Personally I don’t judge anyone if they end their life, it’s their life, their choice, and I certainly feel bad for them, but I know it was probably the right choice. We should be allowed to make the decision, no one else. Just my thoughts."
LucidDreaming,fehjjet,t3_ep5ik4,1579117835.0,"You could just be having a few lucky streaks, or maybe you’re just more intuitive to WILD. Lucid dreaming is a very subjective, personal experience, and no one is alike with everything about lucid dreaming. Yes the majority of people struggle with WILD, but there are a few people like you who find it very easy. I think I’m the same, but that’s only because I’ve been meditating for more than two years now. I envy people who apparently don’t have to meditate or practice at all and can just do WILD, but I also know I’m lucky that I can do WILD at all. A lot of people try and give up because they just can’t understand how it works."

Of course I now know that’s an extremely harsh idea and is a distorted view of what we really are: humans, like anyone else. We just happen to feel a little more which isn’t a terrible thing actually. 

I can’t say I’m super thrilled about being an INFP, but I’ve come to accept it. Like you and one of the other commenters here, I went into denial mode, and it all made me super anxious and my depression worsened. Realizing an INFP is what I am didn’t take all that away, but it was healthy to accept and realize this is who I am. But I also have to remind myself taking one personality test doesn’t dictate my entire life and decide who I am and what I can and can’t be interested in.

I’m only beginning to realize that I’m not actually living life quite right and healthy people don’t do what I do. I know a lot of people like to say everyone is different and there is no normal, but in a way there really is. Whether the person is being genuine or hiding who they really are isn’t necessarily what I mean when I talk about normal. I watch and see how most people talk and do things in public or with friends, how their life goes and what events happen at what age, and that’s what I mean by normal. While there are the minorities who don’t fit in, most people seem to follow the same blue print of go to elementary school, then high school, have a girlfriend (or boyfriend) or two, get license at 16 or latest at 17, pick a college, go to that college, meet someone in college or soon after, get married, start your job, have kids...I know there are plenty of people who don’t have this kind of life, but when I step out in public it’s all I see and that’s why I hate myself and think I’m not “average” or “normal”. I know it’s the wrong way of thinking and it needs to change, but nonetheless I think this way and it causes some of my depression. 

Luckily, being open minded will hopefully give me more chances and opportunities for getting help. I have exhausted myself trying to force myself to be someone I’m not, and because I’m so stubborn or determined, it’s hard to turn this thought process around of having to work through things on my own or be tough and “manly,” like not letting scary things bother me. And I know this is wrong as well, but I want to be able to find my own balance. 

Some of my shame comes from the Bible and what god supposedly says. Whenever I think about caring for myself or thinking about me, I just hear my dad’s and god’s voice screaming at me saying I’m being selfish and I need to trust in god more. I wish I could release all belief and care in what god thinks. 

I don’t know, I think I still want to say more but I don’t want to ramble and over share myself, so I’ll just end this here :I"

That questioning things fundamentally and having nothing to reference, is where I’m probably at right now. I have a disdain for a lot of religious things but also hate things on the other side, like 100% believing there is no god or nothing special going on. Whatever may be true, it’s well hidden from me, and I feel like I’m just getting tossed around between other people’s ideas, and it’s made me wonder what do I think about all this, what’s right or wrong, good or bad, is there a purpose to living? Can’t seem to answer any of these right now..which I know isn’t always a big deal, but a lot of my stress and anxiety comes from me not knowing exactly where I fit and who I am, so it seems to me like it would be beneficial to being able to answer at least *one* of those questions. 

But I definitely don’t want to blame any of my family members or my parents. If anything, some days it feels like I hate myself and can’t stand me more than anyone else. Maybe it’s some r/im14andthisisdeep ish where it’s like I look for the fault in others when it’s been in me all along. 

 I just recently found out I have do a thing called maladaptive daydreaming. I’ve done it since I was a kid, around 4 years old, especially when listening to music. I much prefer going in my head and vividly picturing something and going off far away in my imagination before dealing with any issues here. Sometimes I feel like I’m suffocating if I can’t do this. It’s the only way I can really be myself or act normal. Or it used to, lately it just makes me feel worse. I guess I’m trying to slowly transition me being myself in my imagination to me being myself in reality. 

And this empathy thing has always made me feel like someone stuck on the outside of the group. Because I can vividly imagine things, a lot of times when watching a movie or reading a book I’ll place myself inside the shoes of the main character or anyone I relate to or like. Then when a conflict arises or an inevitable death happens, it almost hits me on a level of it being real and actually happening. I have to tone it way down in front of others. When the movie or book ends, I have this crippling anxiety and sadness that it’s over, everyone else can move on with their lives and think “Hm, good (or bad) book (or movie)!” I think I associate empathy with this part of myself too much and I unintentionally have been striving to get away from it. I know it can be a good thing, as in your case, but I need to learn to handle it a different way. 

Some of this stuff I brought up really embarrasses me, which is what so heavily deters me from reaching out to professionals or even anyone in my family. Reddit’s the first place I can do this because I’m anonymous :)"
infp,fduy0vg,t3_emlbtl,1578740834.0,"Yeah I feel like I do all of those things. I don’t know if this is just me trying to avoid the real problem more, but I really don’t feel like it’s anything to do with emotional neglect. Unless it’s coming from somewhere else that has nothing to do with parents, because they have always been very supporting and caring, they don’t ever do anything anywhere near abuse, emotional or physical. The only emotionally complex thing that’s happened is me questioning and leaving my parent’s religion last year, not openly. My whole life has been great up until I reached high school in 2016. 

After having many of these types of conversations on reddit, it’s becoming clearer I should probably talk this out with a therapist or some professional, I definitely know that now. But like everything else I just don’t feel up to it or care about it. It’s like as long as I can function remotely close to the average human then my mental health means nothing.

AstralProjection,fdt47c2,t3_emst0n,1578711694.0,"I may feel the way I do because I don’t accept everything that most people in this sub do, like the supposedly, extremely rare possibility that a “negative entity” could “cut your silver cord” and thus kill you, but in my opinion it’s not as big a deal if you have mental issues and still AP or LD as a lot of people make it out to be. 

I have severe depression, much anxiety, suicidal and attempted it once a year ago. Personally for me, lucid dreaming/astral projection is one of the few, if not the only, things that make me want to continue living this life. Whether that’s healthy or not isn’t the point of this post, but that’s just what my experience is. 

As long as you can meditate well and have good control over your thoughts most of the time, and if you view APing and LDing as positive and fun things, you really won’t have any issues. I know the deeper you go in these states, the more troubling things you may come across. Unfortunately I can’t say anything about this, as I am still a novice at APing and not considered advanced and LDing (though I’m not a beginner at it either). 

Really it’s up to you. If you feel confident in yourself and ready, screw what anyone else says to you. If you’re ready you’re ready, if you’re strong and brave enough, then handling things like SP, scary dream figures or situations, or these negative entities won’t phase or bother you in the slightest. They don’t for me. Only you really know if you’re capable of handling something like this."
LucidDreaming,fdt1wjf,t3_emzvjm,1578710849.0,"Did you ever vividly or barely feel any water, did anything feel realer, did you see anything? I can’t entirely tell how close you were, I guess close enough because whether you’re believe it’s APing or LDing vibrations are a sing you’re fairly close. Some recommend to wait until the vibrations subside and then imagine yourself climbing out of bed, or if there were visuals then imagine touching whatever you see, try and notice any possible sounds, smells, or anything like that. 

Meditation can help you immensely in the learning process, WILD can be very tricky. One minute you think you have it figured out, but suddenly you find you enter a dream in a completely different way than you did before. Be patient but determined, and keep practicing. If you ever become unsure of if you’re doing anything right, you can check guides of course, but if you are doing everything right and you’re not getting any results, just keep trying. It takes some people a day to have a complete WILD for the first time, others a week, month(s), or even year(s).

Only my torso area is out of my body, and suddenly I feel a presence reach out to me. It’s hard to explain, it wasn’t physical, it’s like the presence itself gentle held onto me and tried to pull me out. I didn’t see orbs, but I did see a light blueish whiteish aura a little ways away from my bed, near my bedroom door. This same thing happened this last time I tried to AP, though I didn’t see any auras, I just felt a presence grab my arm and try to pull me out. Interestingly every time I try to force my way out, the pulling sensation immediately stops, don’t know if this happens to you as well. And I feel this presence (or presences, I don’t know if it’s the same one or two different ones) is completely friendly.

You said you felt the vibrations, were they very strong or small and weak? I know not everyone experiences the same thing, but generally you know when to separate because things get really crazy between the vibrations, possibly hearing things like music, voices, some people hear wind rushing around them. Even if none of that’s present, I find I just “know” when I’m either right on the edge of being able to separate or I’m already there and can go. Maybe it just takes experiencing it for the first time to have this “knowing”. Another thing most people experience it beginning to actually see there room, as if their eyes are open, even though they aren’t. 

I know people aren’t guaranteed to experience any or all or some of these, but they are pretty common. Though it could also be possible that the only reason you failed was because you moved your body physically, instead of mentally through using your imagination."

I will say I’m like you where you see someone else’s artistic abilities and get jealous, so that’s why I’ve started self teaching in digital art. I don’t draw people, I have zero ability and confidence there, but I like to try to draw landscapes, things like the sky, a good sunset, and also I want to start drawing some of my memorable dreams and lucid dreams. 

Whatever creativity you do get in to, make a habit of not looking at other’s creativity too much if it makes you really jealous like it does for me. A little bit is fine for some inspiration, but I find if I look at artwork too much I start comparing an art piece that took someone a week to my art piece that I did in a day, which of course doesn’t have nearly as much detail. Some days you won’t feel very creative or up to making something out of thin air, so don’t get upset if you aren’t into it for whatever reason, it’ll only make things worse anyway. And if you’re like me in this way as well, where you judge yourself a lot for whatever you make, start practicing thinking (talk out loud if that works better) or feeling better about what you make. Appreciate where you’re at, and be happy knowing you’re learning and taking steps to be able to share your creativity with the world. I assume that’s what we really want, we want to share with others all the creative stuff that overfills our minds. I hope to get so good at digital art one day that when someone stops to look at one of my drawings, they go quiet and almost get lost in it, like looking through a window into another universe, or just somewhere nicer. 

Whenever you find whatever creative outlet you’re desiring, I hope this gives you an idea of what thought processes might come up. Just be patient and slow, with finding your “thing” and learning how to get better at it once you do find it."

I’m definitely not an expert with OBEs, but when I reread your post it does kind of sound like it was just a profound and vivid dream. It didn’t really have any of the signs that say it was an OBE, but still, there are a lot of people on this sub that say how they skip over a lot of the famous OBE signs like the vibrations or even exiting the body. I’m still somewhat skeptical of there being a difference between OBEs and lucid dreaming since the WILD process for lucid dreaming is basically what you use to get out of body, but that doesn’t seem to matter to a lot of people. To me it seems more about what you believe rather than the process of how one achieves either lucid dreaming or OBEs."
