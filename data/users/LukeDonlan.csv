bipolar,fdphnic,t3_emjt5u,1578628882.0,I have tinnitus from playing the drums. Cause it might be that... 10% of the population has it.

bipolar,fdmyg4r,t1_fdmusl7,1578571316.0,"That's what I heard could happen... It's roll of the dice, but I'll figure out if I am... I guess. Thanks."

bipolar,fdg9ge1,t1_fdg97xm,1578385772.0,"I get what you mean, but when I feel it, it doesn't effect me as much. Again, it would be nice if it did, and I ended the day with ten thousand words... There is a dread if I fail the minimum one thousand words though. When that happens it usually does the opposite. I get depressed and the next day is entirely unmotivated."
bipolar,fdg97xm,t3_el59ic,1578385462.0,"Well, to help you out a little: I wish I had this..."
bipolar,fdg94zl,t3_el6t24,1578385352.0,"What do manic eyes look like. I know the dilation thing, but is there any other to be a ways?"
bipolar,fdg9077,t1_fdg6q5k,1578385172.0,"I think I blamed the News for my irritation, and depression a little to often. And caffeine for the sudden energy, though that's harder to figure out. I think by triggers she means the things we do to add to the already unstable state... Caffeine is probably everyone first thought. But for me I think it can be the conscious act of wanting, and seeking ways to intensify the highs..."
bipolar,fdg8mgh,t1_fdg83mw,1578384673.0,"Maybe. If by emotionally, then defiantly... But I don't know if I notice things I wouldn't else... Maybe more alert."
bipolar,fdg8h9k,t1_fdg8alk,1578384492.0,"P.S, everyones favourite years was there teenage years. They just grow up to resent that because they grow up!"
bipolar,fdg8alk,t3_el6uri,1578384251.0,"Yep, I've been cycling - literally - between pink Floyd and Eliot Smith... Listening to the lyrics is like a transition of personality, or something... Where the meaning transfers into the feeling of being around a intensely eccentric person? Kind of... It's hard to describe...
I'm like grinning on the verge of tears as each new sound, song plays. 
It doesn't feel like any drugs I've taken... It's more visual; to do with the hole piece. 
Plus some Shpongle, Danavon, and Hendrix..."
bipolar,fdg7o8n,t3_el8bwr,1578383448.0,"Interesting... The other week I was in a pretty bad depression, and one dark and gloomy... Just kidding - I was in the depression though, and I remember thinking the same thing. It was like I was already drunk..."
bipolar,fdg7gmj,t1_fdg5w6d,1578383184.0,What do you mean by body buzzing?
bipolar,fdg7ekk,t3_el813u,1578383112.0,"For whatever I have - it feels as if it's coming from my chest, like a source of energy origination right there. I have flashing memories of prior episodes... And with that comes a sudden intensity. Also stuff like the desire to increase the feeling: caffeine, purposely sleeping, and eating less... It's a state of increased potential. It can be an experience of shame, or artistic satisfaction. Where I find joy in subtle things... 
One way to figure out if your in it... Is if your posts are to long - and your vexed because there aren't enough posts to read in this sub... Me! Conversely, your depressed, and you can't even read the first one."
bipolar,fdeu9v2,t3_ekzl5r,1578346734.0,The colour!
depression,fdetj41,t3_el0i3s,1578346291.0,"maybe because you'd be dead, if you lived in America, means the laws where you live are good?"
depression,fdet8op,t3_ekqk15,1578346121.0,Where do you live?
weed,fdbz29n,t3_ekcswc,1578264067.0,Just the fact they put that on the packages. üòÇ.

bipolar,fcle5dz,t1_fcl8m8t,1577745708.0,"Thanks, I'll do what I can..."
bipolar,fcl7qi6,t1_fcl4yxj,1577741626.0,Unfortunately none. Im being evaluated for anxiety medication. I haven't been diagnosed bipolar; not even sure if I have it - but I've defiantly been developing symptoms of it...
bookporn,fca9r2u,t3_eghhg5,1577565276.0,Looks more like an advert for weed.
bipolar,fc9wzg9,t3_egjhz7,1577559436.0,"Ok, so how would I go about setting it up?"
weed,fc417yh,t3_eg2zqr,1577403951.0,Aw! Some of my best memory as a stoner are with a apple-pipe... It's perfect.
