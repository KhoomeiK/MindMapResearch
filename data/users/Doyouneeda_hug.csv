Your friends are gonna keep offering, remember to shake your head & look away. Your body will question you, but you know what you're doing & tomorrow will be yet another day weedfree (: day by day, bro. Day by day"

I'm still a stoner, but I remember when we didn't have anything this one night. My husband  & I were grumpy because we couldn't sleep. Literally stayed awake past 6am. It is brutal for sure.
But hey, you'll be going back to the non-weed life & in shape too hahha"

lawofattraction,fchd056,t3_eh5q8k,1577649354.0,"I would just like to add my two cents, because I do see how you are trying to explain it.

Its like planting a seed into the universe. For example lets say the ""seed"" is the car or the job you want. You've been eyeballing it, you've been thinking about it & how you see yourself in that position. So now the universe knows what you want & you know what you want.

#Thats it

That's literally it. You know you want it. You don't doubt getting it. Its just a feeling & before you know it you have it."

selfimprovement,fccjorh,t1_fcc89rm,1577599172.0,"I have a coworker whom just returned to work & upon catching up, he tells me that he was gonna switch studies & after taking a break he said he wasnt going to switch, because after 5 years of going to college for the same thing he doesn't want it to go to waste. So he's looking for jobs around the same field.. not sure if this helps, but you picked your career path for a reason, don't forget that reason. If you started because you really liked it or it peaked your interest, ykno.

For number two.. I dont know what to tell you buddy.. (I lied, I have a lot to say on the subject) but everyone is different. Everyone's gonna have a different experience. There is no certain way to feel & we also aren't taught, but yet we grew up watching all these love stories & shit... 
Honestly, I would say focus on what you need to focus on. That's priority number one. 
When the time is right, the right person will show up.. you could also just enjoy your time & conversations w your company, friends, & family. Be yourself.

You don't know this, someone will fall in love w your smile, but you gotta show it üòÑ
Keep your head up. You're not behind. You are where you're suppose to be üëçüèª"

Two: If you're too afraid to act now, just go w the flow until you feel is the right time; dont overthink about ""the right time"" because in reality there's never a right time. So you not wanting to act on it right now is ok."
