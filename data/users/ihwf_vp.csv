NianticWayfarer,ff8n5mx,t1_ff8msvf,1579686902.0,"I've posted these around prior to submitting and got fairly positive responses out of them.  Now that I submitted 7 of them, 2 were rejected and 1 was accepted.  Others are still in voting.  

In my opinion, they are a little bit of a stretch.. I do not believe they are a 5\* by any means but I think they have a little more information on them than some trail markers that I have seen make it to the game so I figured they were worth the submissions.  

This park is such a great park to play in but there is only 4 stops in this park currently. Spawns show up for community day but you go through your balls terribly fast and there is no way to refill.  It would be a huge asset to our community to find a way to get them approved but if it's truly not a quality enough submission, I understand"

texascountry,ff6emhd,t3_ergx45,1579625526.0,Good idea.. But would be a lot easier if you could search and then sort by most recent ascending and descending so you didn't have to scroll all the way to the bottom manually

GetMotivated,fektc5a,t1_fekt3vu,1579207179.0,"I definitely thought about that as I was typing it originally.  The reason it's not THAT is because then it wouldn't make any sense physically. Even so, would be nice to at least think it could happen."
GetMotivated,fejpxpc,t1_fejocmp,1579182836.0,"That is the exact opposite of what myself and the other user are trying to say.  I don't care who you support or what side you support.  It would still be better to see them working more bipartisan like we have done for centuries than to do this mess we are in now.  

Disagreements have happened for an eternity but we have to stop at just letting them be a difference of opinion and not take offense just because someone has a different opinion .. We elect these people to work together and try to make the country a better place for the next generation and that the moment it's barely happening"

NianticWayfarer,fehua4s,t1_fehu51u,1579123996.0,Gotcha.  Would think it would be easier to just add that option than to create a whole new form.

My first submission on the 5th, everything was accepted in under 10 days. 

My second submission on the 21st, 2 were accepted within 2 days (both were automatically upgraded) and the other 5 are all still in voting, 8 days later.

I wondered if this batch would take longer with the Christmas holiday season. People are busy and not doing them.  For me, I've been off work 5 days and been rating the hell out of them though

 My parents divorced in 1990 when I was 5 years old. This past December, we had the both of them, my brother, sister and myself together at my dad's surprise 75th birthday. Was pretty cool that after 28 years, we have a picture of all 5 of us together!"

This last 14 day submission, I had all 7 of my stops accepted and in game within 9 days.  Would have been great to start another 7 submissions right then.  The game should reward you for adding quality stops to the game."
