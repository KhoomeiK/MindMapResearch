This isn't an anti-age gap view, okay. My own boyfriend is 51. But what I appreciate in him, among others, is his experience.

You guys are talking marriage. Will you still want to be with an 18-year-old (psychologically) when you're 25? 35?

Also think about the hard stuff.

When I'll retire at hopefully 64, my bf will be 82. He might need a nurse. He might suffer from Alzheimer's disease.

This will happen to you when you're around 50. Can you see yourself doing that? Can you see yourself being a widow at that age? It's tough to think about. Something I feel hopeless about it, although most of the time I feel like the good in our relationship outweighs the bad ending.

Think about kids. Do you want some? Does he want some? Will be still want them when he's in his sixties? Do you want to bring up a 10-year old with a 70-year old dead who's too tired to play football or run on the beach? Are you ready to help your kid deal with grieving when their dad dies before they've graduated?

I'm not discouraging you, but I do encourage you both to think about the hard stuff, not just the good times."
