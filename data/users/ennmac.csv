sexualhealth,ffi8jsa,t3_etp1db,1579967859.0,"I have one, and it honestly changed my life for the better. I wasn't good at other kinds of birth control, I'd spend days each month mildly depressed (at minimum), and I was getting anemic from blood loss. My IUD turned it all around for me! There was a definite adjustment period (ha), about three months of spotting and cramps, and basically nothing since then. If you're really sensitive to pain, the insertion and initial time might be pretty uncomfortable, but it passes. When they insert it, they'll dilate your cervix first, then put it in. Every cervix is different, so this might be more or less painful - DON'T BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR A PAINKILLER OR ANTI ANXIETY MEDS! If it helps you relax, it's worth it. Good luck!"

bigboobproblems,ffezyp5,t3_et0bep,1579871789.0,"I found a trick for band/festival t-shirts and now I wear them all the time! First, cut off the crew neck, making it a bit more like a boat-neck. Then, cut a slit up from the bottom hem (6""-a foot), near the side seam on the front of the shirt. Tie it in a knot (makes it tighter around the hips, or bum if it's long enough), and the boat neck will probably wear like an off-the-shoulder. This is the best way I've found to flatter-mod oversize t-shirts without destroying the image on the front or back."

confidentlyincorrect,ffey01x,t1_ffes24n,1579869944.0,... but we're not rating sexual assault by severity here are we? I'm not cool with telling somebody that my sexual assault was worse than his because somebody managed to coerce an erection out of him.

sexualhealth,fep045z,t1_feo7jvv,1579309161.0,"Yup, 10000% that's what's happening. Your partner needs to get treated too, or it'll keep happening. You both need to do treatment at the same time, and probably avoid sex for a bit to make sure you're not getting a new infection each time."
sexualhealth,femwlg6,t3_epwvk0,1579271508.0,"BV and yeast infections can recur over and over. You need to go back to the doctor and tell them that the antibiotic treatment you got isn't cutting it, and they need another course of treatment. Usually, there's a standard way to treat these things, so they've probably been giving you the same regimen over and over, and it needs to be switched up. Bring your old prescriptions so they can review what you've already tried, and figure out a new approach. You might need to be a bit demanding, but good luck!"

I know, this isn't on his mind  (her money!!) but it sounds like he's a narcissist and I don't think he cares about anybody else - BUT he might care enough about his reputation to respond to the threat of public shame.

It's not long-term, there's no potential for a relationship, it's clearly not about her personally, and it's to suit a need that you two have at this moment. Not to be rude, but as a bi woman who's into threesomes, I'm not seeing a whole lot that makes this an appealing option for me. You need to think about this as you would about any other hook-up; what makes this specific person happy, what do they like, how do you communicate with them in a way that makes them comfortable. Calling yourself non-unicorn hunters when you are is likely to get somebody's hopes up, so at least be honest when you're approaching people.

Then the vein would start to go dark and slowly spread. But if that hasn't happened, then it's REALLY unlikely to be blood poisoning. It could be a bruise or inflammation, or maybe some swelling that's pushing a blood vessel closer to the skin. Don't panic, but maybe check your balls for swelling or lumps and make a doctor's appointment just to be safe. You say it's just one vein - is it like a visible vein, or just a line on your skin?"
