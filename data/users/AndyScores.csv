The show then went down in the ratings over the course of the following season and, unknown to the viewers, Duffy was convinced to come back. In the final few seconds of the season finale his character’s widow walks in sees her dead husband alive, soaping himself up in the shower. And, thus, the entire season leading up to that point was written off as her having had a bad dream.    

That show was Dallas."
technology,fffgdjy,t1_fff787i,1579883373.0,If this becomes a thing in Canada I hope that’s what we’ll start doing. Although our cell phones may already be doing it.
NetflixSexEducation,ffbb9aw,t1_ffbatx1,1579758295.0,"Jamie Bell was really good in a recent movie called Film Stars Don’t Die In Liverpool.  
If you haven’t seen Pride from 2014 I recommend it! It’s a true story about an unlikely alliance between a bunch of British gays and rural coal miners working together in the 80’s. It’s super heartwarming."

Side note: your church spent millions to fight against gay people’s right to get married in an entirely different state, California, with Prop 8. That right there lets it’s followers know what the stance is and how much they value gay families, which in turn results in the exact type of ostracization that OP experienced by the followers of your church."

news,ffaqi9i,t1_ffama04,1579742122.0,"So are you gay or not because if you’re not, then yeah, obviously you weren’t ostracized, and then why are you even commenting?"
politics,ffahpeb,t1_ffagt4s,1579735993.0,Oh yeah on weekends that’s the best!
NetflixSexEducation,ffahjgq,t1_ffaeq9p,1579735883.0,"Ahahaha  WHOOSH!  
That made my day!  
  
You *do* realize smartphones didn’t exist in the 80’s? So maybe it should’ve been obvious I was joking?   
  
Also, schools don’t teach the history of the cell phone, as far as I’m aware, so paying attention in school has nothing to do with it."
politics,ffagkgp,t1_ffad1gk,1579735248.0,"Haha Yeah when I eat that heavy of a meal I’m just lethargic for the rest of the day, but it’s so worth it. Once in a while, at least."
politics,ffage4v,t1_ffae0oe,1579735130.0,"Interesting. Thanks for the info. We use Celcius not Fahrenheit so I had to google the conversions there.
Yeah can’t deny the cost of living is pretty butal!"
NetflixSexEducation,ffadyng,t1_ff7n04j,1579733337.0,"Hey thanks I hadn’t heard of that movie and it sounds like something I’d like. I love British films like that. Pride, Billy Elliot, Full Monty etc. They’re the kind of films I watch with my mom when I go visit her.  
Got any more recommendations?"
politics,ffadg8m,t1_ffacouf,1579732955.0,"I’m pretty sure N.B. gets lots of snow and has cold winters. I wouldn’t call that great weather. The best weather in Canada is in southwestern British Columbia (Greater Vancouver).  
Regardless, I hear you and those are good points. I’d actually like to live on the east coast for a few years."
