Anxiety,ffhy83r,t3_etpzge,1579959018.0,"Depends on the person. Some people feel relaxed with green tea since it contains a substance that aids with calming down, but for caffeine sensitive individuals, the caffeine will overpower everything else.

I’m anxious 24/7 so any sort of caffeine will give me strong heart palpitations. Green tea, coke, Mountain Dew, even decaf coffee will give me heightened sense of anxiety due to the jitteriness. It’s also usually accompanied by indigestion."
Anxiety,ffhxsv0,t3_etnwzx,1579958547.0,"I get this too. When anxiety kicks in, my legs become jelly like people in cartoons do when they see a ghost. Putting a glass of water to my mouth is also hard because my hands shake really badly too."
Showerthoughts,ff1qji0,t3_er181r,1579483964.0,"I never grew up rich, struggled financially my whole life, and I always thought money could totally buy happiness to a certain extent. However, recent life experience really changed my perspective. I finally understood the wisdom behind the saying. I think what would be accurate is to say “money can buy comfort and temporary excitement, but not lasting happiness.”

I wish I could be more articulate about this but it’s one of those things where you gotta experience to fully understand."
2meirl4meirl,feyghux,t1_fey7b32,1579445212.0,"Thanks for the reply. Your perspective and experience really does set you apart from someone like me. To this day, I have not attended a single funeral and I have not lost anyone I was close to. I guess that’s why I feel so unprepared. I’m already panicking about not knowing how to plan my parents’ funeral when the time comes and shedding tears trying to figure out if I should bury my pets under a special tree when they die or cremate them. They’re all still healthy and in their prime but I just can’t shake knowing the inevitable.

As for my own, I honestly don’t fear death itself. What I do fear is getting **too old** to function properly or not ageing gracefully. I just can’t imagine myself decaying away, suffering from incontinence and other serious age related conditions. I wouldn’t be left with any dignity. In the scenario where I become severely cognitively impaired, I have concocted two possible best and worst outcomes. At best, I have children or family willing to take care of me, but it would traumatise/hurt them deeply as I start to become unrecognisable. At worst, I’m completely alone with no money whatsoever. Since I wouldn’t even have the cognitive ability to attempt suicide, I’ll just slowly starve to death on the streets.

Honestly, I am trying, but I just don’t know how to feel better about something I know isn’t fixable. I just want to freeze time and stay in this moment forever. Things aren’t great but it beats losing everyone and everything, and eventually my own mind. Hopefully we’ll both find peace soon. Again, thanks."
2meirl4meirl,fewyxao,t3_epfaib,1579421625.0,"Hi guys, not sure if I’ll even get any replies but I just wanted to share what I’ve been struggling with.

I’ve suddenly developed a deep deep fear of my loved ones dying. My pets, my friends, my family, you name it. I know it’s going to happen and I’m not in denial or anything, but just the thought of having to deal with the loss is crippling. I can’t sleep at night and I get anxiety attacks over it.

I just find life to be so endlessly pointless. No matter how successful or famous or happy you are while you’re alive, you’ll eventually die and you can’t take any of it with you. And if your life was riddled with misfortunes, it makes life seem all the more futile. I mean it’s just blank after that. I guess believing in heaven comforts some people, but what is the point of struggling through life just so you can pay your bills and die of old age? It’s natural that life starts and ends but as humans, we are too self aware and we understand mortality. I’m plagued by this.

Social media isn’t even fun for me anymore. I see a lot of death/age related content and it makes me break out in sweat. Time is passing by so fast. What used to be “young celebrities” are now in their 30’s and 40’s... Bittersweet posts about cleaning out their late grandparents’ house... People sharing the burden of taking care of elderly parents with dementia... Pets having to be put down...

I’m in my late 20’s and I know and accept that all these things will eventually happen to me. The fear has made me less materialistic and finally helped me realised what actually matters in life. But I just can’t help feel so sad and afraid."
OCD,fegrtox,t1_fefzvkd,1579101056.0,Omg me too. My mouth gets me into trouble constantly and I’ve been trying to fix this but I can’t stop!
antinatalism,fegf08k,t1_fegeb2p,1579090504.0,"I think you misunderstood what I meant. I was trying to explain that your family’s attitude about feeling sad doesn’t align with the Christian theology when they seem to be so smug about being good Christians. Nothing to do with anyone being close to or far away from god, nothing to do with Christianity in general. I should’ve phrased it better and I didn’t mean to freak you out. I understand that you’re deeply hurt by religion, and I was just trying to validate how you felt about them being in the wrong by providing extra context. They are imposing religion on others when they don’t have a proper grasp on it themselves.

Being alive is most definitely a burden on me too. That’s why I’m never going to have kids."
antinatalism,fegbu18,t3_eoz02r,1579086762.0,"Typically, deeply (and incorrectly) religious people think if you are struggling, it’s cause you’re letting the devil get to you or that you’re not godly enough. Hence the name calling and shaming. But that’s not the correct way of seeing things. I’m Christian myself, and any proper Christian will know that is that life is not meant to be pain free. In fact the closer you are to god, the more likely you are to go through hardships. That’s why I hate the cultish Christians. They clearly lack understudying of the bible and claim to be the best.

I’m so sorry you had to deal with that. You do not need to feel thankful or guilty or like to owe your adoptive parents anything. You didn’t make them do anything. They adopted a child because they wanted to. Anyone who demands respect or emotional compensation for “rescuing” a child, pet, whatever, is egotistical and suffer from saviour complex. Don’t buy into it. You are valid. Be secure in yourself so you can live life as the best version of yourself. You can do it and you know it."
antinatalism,fed91jo,t1_fed7g4p,1579004203.0,"There are times when my parents demand something from me because “I owe them” for raising me. We get into a fight and I’ll say “I never asked to be born. How is it fair to say that I owe you things when you were the ones who decided to have me?!” Then they freak out and say I am insolent, ungrateful, rude, what have you. You can’t hold your children against the fact that you had to feed, clothe, and educate them as if they forced you into it. Like WTF you were the ones who chose to have kids. It’s not their fault!"
Millennials,fe940cz,t1_fcnho1i,1578933960.0,"Kinda late to this but I’m 92 and I feel the same way. I know I’m clear cut millennial but I don’t feel a disconnect when it comes to gen z stuff. The slangs and pop culture, aesthetics, aren’t foreign to me. I relate to gen z more than I relate to older millennials."
Millennials,fe8z9vi,t3_ek6ewo,1578932495.0,"Born 1992, deeply relate to both 3rd and 4th waves. Actually, I don’t feel a disconnect with the current gen z in their late teens either. In fact I relate better to them compared to 2nd wave millennials. Surely I can’t be the only one?"
Millennials,fe8w0fq,t1_fdmtds8,1578931624.0,"I’ve noticed this too. Like have you seen 40 year olds lately? They look like they’re still in their 20s! People have been physically aging at a slower pace than maybe our parents’ generation. Also cause nowadays there’s less societal pressure to dress a certain way after a certain age so people haven’t really been dressing “older” if you get what I mean.

I do look at old movies or shows and get super confused when I see characters in their 20’s working senior management jobs with the personality of a middle aged person. That’s just not what I see in real life."
antinatalism,fe8hk7h,t3_emyxae,1578926215.0,Are people serious?! We could be researching how to reverse actual diseases and THIS is what’s getting down?! I’m out.
2meirl4meirl,fe72t7q,t3_enzqy5,1578909194.0,Okay can relate but... what 15 year old is “waiting for the one after multiple toxic relationships”??
TooAfraidToAsk,fe6xwxv,t1_fe6m6zf,1578907547.0,"Here’s the thing. In addition to our dying planet, if you have gone through a large amount of bad experiences in life, you will probably feel inclined to rethink having children because you don’t want to subject another human being to this kind of life. I can relate to that because my life has not been a cake walk since day one, but not everyone can. 

There’s no point being confused about other people’s life choices even if you feel like it defies all logic because perspective is incredibly subjective. And if raising a family was a dream, I doubt a bleak looking future would stop anyone because ultimately, people *do what they want.* 

Why do people eat at McDonald’s? Why do financially unstable people continue to have kids? Why do people who aren’t ready to be parents continue to have unprotected sex? Consequences are there and most of us are aware of it. It’s just a matter of “But I want it sooooo bad! I’m sure it’ll be fine.” It certainly isn’t fair that someone called you melodramatic because you’re most certainly not."
AmItheAsshole,fe6hukb,t1_fe6gq88,1578891367.0,"Basically came to lengthily explain what you just summarised so well. Adoption is obviously the best thing to do when getting a pet, and arguably what you SHOULD do, but if you did your homework, tracked down a reputable breeder, and you’re a responsible pet owner, it’s not that bad. But to anyone reading, please always consider adoption first before purchasing a pet.

Also, try not to support the continued breeding of breeds that are born with traits that negatively impact their quality of life just for the sake of cuteness."
TooAfraidToAsk,fe6gpoc,t3_enz668,1578890372.0,"I’m like you. Having a biological child that looks like me matters nothing. But that’s not the majority. Humans and all animals in general have the natural instinct to procreate and continue their kind or lineage or whatever. Some humans have less of this instinct and some have more. Some people also say that they don’t feel capable of loving a child that isn’t theirs.

Another argument would be that adoption has the potential to take a lot longer to achieve cause of how the system is set up. However, IVF has no guarantee either and it may end up costing just as much as adoption (if not more) both monetarily and time wise. So basically at the end of the day, people just really really want biological kids."
unpopularopinion,fe6dfzu,t3_ent3cw,1578887678.0,"I agree that getting pregnant isn’t an accomplishment even if you do suffer from infertility. Because like you said, doesn’t require much hustling to get there for people who don’t have fertility issues, and I don’t think doctor visits, getting injections, freezing eggs, etc can compare to climbing Everest. But if the pregnancy was a wanted one, and they had to go through emotional and physical trauma to get there, it’s a reason to celebrate. People aren’t getting congratulated for the achievement. The celebration is for the milestone of becoming a parent, and the beginning of a new life."
offmychest,fe66gnq,t1_fe64s59,1578882858.0,"That’s how I always feel. At best, I’m the token friend that was written in the story just so the main character could use me as a stepping stool to get where they need to. All my life I’ve been telling myself things will change when I finally move on to middle school, then high school, then college, then a new career. It never got better."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdx3huw,t1_fdx2b8k,1578764923.0,"Ah, you’re from the south! Makes sense. I used to live in Nashville and man, people were getting married and having kids before 25. Move to bigger cities and you’ll see that it’s way different. Don’t worry yourself too much. Married at 22, single at 50, honestly who cares? You only need to follow your own path. Everyone has their own timeline."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdx08k1,t1_fdwx9up,1578764007.0,"That’s very odd to me. Could be a regional or cultural thing but people around me who are 30 were never married, no kids, still active and doing fun things outside of just drinking and dinner, pretty much the same thing people do in their 20s. I’m in my late 20s and I feel no different than when I was 21 either. Except of course the obvious things like being more responsible etc. As for dating, of course I’m more picky than I was before but it’s not because I’m broken or because I’m rushing to get married or anything. It’s because now that I’m older, I know what to look for in a partner and I can better differentiate between good traits and fuck boi traits. Seriously, nobody my age or 30+ around me are even close to settling down. The exceptions are the ones who are religious or very conservative, or married for citizenship etc. Which to me aren’t very good reasons."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdwmi6b,t1_fdwdqcz,1578760239.0,Please elaborate. This sounds like it might get interesting.
TwoXChromosomes,fdwe3pk,t1_fdvoftn,1578757764.0,Wow you are totally missing the point.
unpopularopinion,fdv5al2,t3_en2fq1,1578743338.0,"I think this might be on a screen to screen basis. I'm on a Macbook and the arrow is a deep red-orange. Totally different from the red-orange on the reddit logo which leans more orange than red. But some people claim it to be the same colour as the reddit logo, so I don't know. At least we can all agree that the other one is blue."
TwoXChromosomes,fduwkht,t1_fdu2gpl,1578740060.0,Also can we talk about why women who want epidurals are seen as selfish too? The attitude is so confusing to me. You don’t want a painful birth for your child? Selfish bitch.
TwoXChromosomes,fduw9lm,t1_fdt9g3w,1578739904.0,That’s the thing. A lot of young families are influencer families. They had the money to begin with. People see that and think that’s normal. The rest of us get looked down upon for being failures when the reality is so different.
TwoXChromosomes,fduuvi6,t1_fdtw6ez,1578739212.0,I honestly feel like some people have not evolved enough to distinguish between instinct and logic. These people are acting totally out of the biological instinct to procreate and to pass on genes + have someone to care for them when they get older. I’m one of the younger millennials and life has gotten so hard that none of my peers are happy. Everyone is depressed or anxious around me. We live in constant fear. I just can’t bring myself to subject another life to this kind of existence.
TwoXChromosomes,fdutrpy,t1_fdudgv4,1578738701.0,"Dass what I’ve been saying!! Like it’s arguably MORE selfish to have biological kids than it is to not have kids. People always say adoption takes too long and it’s too expensive so you can’t judge people for wanting to make new babies, but nobody makes that connection when it comes to IVF. Depending on your own fertility and luck, both IVF and adoption has the potential to end up costing the same amount of time and money. It’s an invalid argument. As someone who has suffered for being born into a financially unstable family that contributed to a long list of lifelong problems, I swore to myself I will NEVER subject another person to this kind of life. It’s a struggle to just barely keep my head above water every single day and it keeps getting tougher. I can’t do this to another human being."

offmychest,fcuc9dk,t1_fcu7w5v,1577977604.0,"I’m in the US too! I just feel like everything is subliminally feeding a lot of pressure towards young people.

offmychest,fcubin5,t1_fcu9mi0,1577977115.0,"That’s the thing. So many people feel this way. I’ve been feeling this way for most of my 20’s and when I turned 27, it just reached a culmination point."
