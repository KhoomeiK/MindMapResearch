EDAnonymous,ff8qxaf,t3_es5rqs,1579692430.0,"They are either lying, miscounting, or just started and won't be able to keep it up for long. If someone is eating 800 calories a day without going over they'd die within a couple months unless they too were obese."
GenderCriticalGuys,ff8qqo1,t1_ff81mqx,1579692183.0,"There are so many barriers right now that there's not a good way to know if fewer women than men are interested in that job. Sometimes women who are or were very interested in stem topics and trying to work their way up were literally told things along the lines of ""you're just not interested or talented because you're female"" when they obviously are. 

I also think it's important to say that it comes down to the number of people in each group who are interested, not stereotype the group's overall level of interest. Certainly, most men don't want to be engineers either. And even though there may be fewer women, those who are into the idea are very into it."
GenderCriticalGuys,ff7zgt0,t3_es4val,1579662067.0,"*not a guy*

I think most people's problem isn't that careers aren't 50/50, it's that there's things that are preventing women from doing certain jobs. Like, it's not a big deal if everyone gets a chance and it turns out that it's not an even split, but it is a big deal that not everyone gets a chance."

When I look in the mirror, I feel like Iâ€™m just seeing a pump. Even after a couple days, you know how your muscles still have a little extra tension in them? I feel like thatâ€™s all I have.

EDAnonymous,ff39qiv,t3_er4ajt,1579536995.0,"In my opinion, the calories we burn by walking to get a SF drink and pick it up and drink it balance out the <10 calories in the drink, so I wouldn't worry about it.

I like cold brew with SF syrups lately. As far as actual energy drinks, I like SF red bull, some of the monster ultra flavors (black, blue, purple), and LOVE the taste of cotton candy rockstar or cotton candy bang but those have too much damn caffeine for me. I gotta keep it under 180-200mg a day or else I end up getting a panic attack that night."
EDAnonymous,ff39k87,t1_ff2w3sc,1579536883.0,"I love the black cherry and the blue. The only one I haven't tried is red, but I hate fruit punch, so I probably will not try it. I made myself sick of the white by drinking it too much, since in the past it was the only ultra flavor that came in a mega monster, but then they starting selling purple mega monsters, so purple is now my go-to."
EDAnonymous,ff39fga,t3_er9oc1,1579536799.0,"Update on last night, I did hit the guy up, but he was busy. I feel like that was, in a way, the best of both because I could demonstrate my interest without having to actually follow through lol. 

I ended up semi-binging though, but on foods I already had at home. 2100 calories which yeah, is a little high, but I ran 6 miles yesterday, so it balances out. Certainly better than eating 4000+ cals of pizza or whatever and still having leftovers."
EDAnonymous,ff397jl,t1_ff0ab41,1579536657.0,"I'm the opposite, I wish they make sodas/syrups that were mostly about the flavor with less of the actual sweetener. Maybe they could even sell more by framing it as something that goes in addition to normal sugar."

There have been a few other times like this where I try to fast, am not feeling hungry or bad at all, but the number on my watch freaks me out so I eat so I don't die.

I'm BMI 23, for heck's sake. I have enough to lose weight without any weird side effects. I really, really want (wanted?) to restrict to 1000 a day because it will allow me to perfectly hit my goal on the day of a big event. Physically and mentally I feel fine.
