dragonage,ffdqvp4,t3_esqdp1,1579826744.0,"+1 for Origin squad reunion. The hardening mechanics, the fact that they tried to kill you if they didn't agree with what you tried to do, BEST voice acting of the 3 games, all made up for some of the dialogue being cringy and times sounding like a harem anime.

Definitely changed my opinion on DA2 companions after a replay. IMO they are the most fleshed out and had party banter that was sometimes better than DAO. Just a little one dimensional, but the agency given to them in this game made them feel human. You knew where they stood, because they wer downright annoying about it, but this was offset by some of their meaningful calm moments.

My current playthrough of Inquisition has actually worsened my opinion of some of companions and advisors though. Maybe this is just me being salty at the reduced banter frequency, but after playing DAO and DA2, they sometimes felt like robots whose purpose is to dump info on you. They sound like what you expect people in your videogames to sound like, and not like actual people, if that makes sense.

I like freddie, but I dislike iron bull voice acting after this playthrough (mostly his angry, grunting moments feel so reserved and forced at the same time); the whole cassandra being obsessed with varrics novel was portrayed in a way that I felt was a huge disservice to the character; cullen just seems like the  worst general when you see him drill his troops; used to like josephine, but now i lump her together with vivienne and sera as the most stagnant characters in any bioware game i've played. Idk why i feel like the female companions in this game had the least character growth (and maybe varric, but thats varric), but there it is. Maybe its some of that ""idgaf, this is me"" energy seeping in. 

Also, that wicked grace game in the varric questline was one of the most forced, awkward, disjointed attempts at... whatever they were trying attempt there. A lot of missed opportunites for characters in this game.

Right now, DA2>=DAO>DAI"

CasualPH,ff8bsix,t3_es5slu,1579672179.0,"I think there was a study done on guys like Bill Gates, and people in other fields with comparable success, and it was found that ""*RESILIENCE*"" was it? I think the ease of expressing oneself is just a by-product of this.

Resilience can mean a lot of things. Part of resilience includes having the resources to bounce back after hard failure, hence why it's just flat out easier for those already with resources to find more success. Not only those who have money, but also those with good support systems, a personality that easily forgets mistakes/failures (there are a lot of success stories of people who had troubled childhoods), or simply those with the willpower and mindset of always having a back-up plan (to a lesser extent - sometimes every plan you have just goes to shit).

You have time to hone your craft if you don't have to worry about what you have to eat the next day; you can devote your existence to a specific pursuit if you have people to keep you grounded; and you can shrug off rejection after rejection if you simply don't care about the consequences (or you have a back-up plan ;). You know why you see a shitload of talented kids everywhere? because they have literally nothing else to worry about.

When these kids lose their resources or support systems (because they are simply too costly to maintain for an entire lifetime), and when they start to get a sense of what their failures truly cost (not only to them, but to the people around them), then that is where you get burnouts."

Zeus is always gonna deal damage, but there are heroes that can just flat out dumpster you in the late game (AM, storm) , which is a risk I wouldnt take in your bracket, so I think he is somewhat situational.

Aghanims is a gamechanging item. If you find yourself in a position where you are safe and can free farm, get aghs asap. After I get arcane boots, if I notice I have at least 1.5k without my team needing me for fights, i usually rush aghs. 

I see alot of people make the mistake of holding on to nimbus during times without fights, which is a wast IMO. Its a great tool for pushing out lanes and disrupting equilibrium.

Also, BoT is pretty good right now, so you might want to consider rushing that after aghs (maybe even before, depending on how your games go)"

Agree with most of these except the ""Bhelen is objectively better choice"". Throughout the Orzammar questline, Bhelen is clearly presented as a traitorous regicide who would do anything for the throne. On the other hand, while Harrowmont is classified as a traditionalist who wants to keep the oppression going, nothing expressly states this without you having to dig a little deeper, or to play through other origins (tbh can't even recall a single instance beyond codex entries and bhelens town crier). When you meet Bhelen, he is the shifty-eyed, cut throat, aggressor, while Harrowmont greets you as a weary old man who just wants to do right by his city and his old friend.

Most of these choices you present become the objectively better choices because you know what happens at the epilogue, but during your playthrough of the game, the dilemmas are there.

My first playthrough, although I chose to use the mages to save connor and his mom, I did so knowing the risks that my absence might worsen the situation in redcliffe, and came back fully prepared to face the consequences after the circle quest."

My father decided this would be a good opportunity to chastise me on my bad sleeping and eating habits, started rattling off the things that I had to do, everything I had to *give up,* otherwise all my effort would be meaningless.

I keep telling myself it was fully well-intentioned, but god damn was it demotivating. I couldn't get mad, because why would I get mad? There was nothing wrong with the message. But damn, nothing stops you in your tracks than being told what you were doing would probably amount to nothing, if you don't do all this other shit.

Pretty hard to tell him to just shut the fuck up, because I wasn't that kind of teen. So I just told him that I wasn't expecting to live past 25. I didn't think I meant it at the time, but his dead silence at the prospect made me question if it was all that unappealing, to either of us.

I am currently 3 years into my third job, where I managed to ruin my professional career by always coming in late to work, and doing fuck all when I'm there. I am awaiting the inevitable decline of my life when I get fired, I get sued by my employers, and get kicked out by my parents for being a worthless leech. My weight also fluctuates to reflect my mental state, and right now I am overweight/obese (85kg). I've been diagnosed with hypertension since I was 24, and now can't exercise properly because I suspect I have a heart disease and my kidneys are failing. I've also been diagnosed with neuropathy due to high blood sugar/pre-diabetes. But through all this anxiety, I dread going to the doctor more because I don't have insurance, and I don't want to spend the remainder of my life in a dirty hospital room waiting for an unmotivated asshole in a white coat to kill me on the operating table.

While we may have different problems, I've had similar thoughts. Don't cringe when you say ""the good guy gets nothing"". A lot of wrong, idealistic shit is taught to us when we are children about what it means to be a good person. The main fuck-up there is that the propaganda targeted at rich liberal children to be more ""self-sacrificing"" and ""give themselves to others"" gets thrown around among less privileged circles. The monkeys and the sociopaths will be ok, but empaths and kids raised like adults will have the hardest time reconciling why success/happiness comes at the perceived expense of others, or the disruption of the structure that they have known their whole life. This world owes us nothing if we don't decide to take it for ourselves.

You are right in that being good and positive won't help you. What you need to do is to know what you want, and dedicate your whole life in pursuit of that. Happiness comes if it wills."

Worst thing I can surmise from the post is that he cheated, which does warrant being ignored IMO, but otherwise anything less would be a little iffy.

I agree 100% that if the fiancee so readily called off the engagement, then talking to you was not what made her consider that decision, and he did some shit to make her doubt it.

Felt a little awkward just meeting all these people for the first time, and getting unloaded on.

MMOs like ESO address the limitations of grouping by just having the mobs adjust to player level. This solves a lot of problems, but takes away some of that connection.

I think an MMO with a unique and deep fast travel system, similar to flying in WoW, which allowed you to  experience the world without the dangers, and gives you choices on speed, location, or means at early levels would be able to bridge this.

Replaying DA2, and find that Isabela is actually one of the funniest companions, and enjoying her parts in the Aveline romance quest. Man I wish they still made games like this."

Not only were these great titles themselves, but they also opened you up to great games from the past that hold up even now. What I would give to experience that again for the first time."

But, more a fan of fantasy vs. sci-fi, so I didn't consider titles like this, KotoR, and newer ones like Outer Worlds, Cyberpunk, Fallout etc."

Yeah, I guess Bioware at its peak was just a different beast from developers today."

dragonage,fc47evn,t3_eg0yhh,1577408633.0,"This current playthrough has me thinking the same. He literally killed a man in cold blood for refusing the joining. He said it was in self defense, but what was he gonna do if the guy didn't pull out his sword? Let him go to spread the secrets?

Every time he says ""the grey wardens do what they must"" has taken on a whole new meaning to me, and it has even affected some of my choices this playthrough."

Honestly, it was a slog, especially the buggy mess that was awakening. What kept me going was that I needed to experience each moment again in order to make the choices I would be happy with to build the world for my eventual DAI playthrough."
skyrim,fbxpq06,t3_eet2as,1577196993.0,Some of the best memories I have of this game was going against some of the harder bosses underleveled using poisons/alchemy. Really makes you feel like an assassin stealth archer
