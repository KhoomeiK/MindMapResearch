That will help keep you from accidentally killing it with a one-hit ultimate.

Note that sick leave in the maternity context only counts for recovery from labor and for doctor visits or you or a family member getting sick and needing you to care for them.  The rest has to be annual or LWOP.

But for agencies where employees' attendance is more critical, they could count your FMLA from the first day of medical absence, whether it's LWOP or not.  After 12 weeks of absence, they could potentially start denying your leave requests.

I will say, though, that there are two huge issues with online dating, one for guys and one for girls (at least for straight guys and girls - not sure how it goes on the gay side).

For guys, it's basically like taking all the rejection you might have in a year of chatting up women at the bar (or wherever you go to chat up women) and packing it all into a few days.  Completely demoralizing.

For girls, it's like taking all of the skeevy creeps who might chat you up and/or try to roofie you at the bar (or wherever you go to get chatted up) and packing it all into a few days.  Completely disgusting.

And all of that is before you even go on a date.

So you have to go into it with the right perspective.  If you set high expectations or have high desperation, it will make things worse.  Go into it with the mindset of, well, maybe I'll meet someone, but if I don't, no big deal, and you'll be fine.

Online dating does have the advantage of being able to cut out the vast majority of people who aren't a good match for you, compared to meeting them randomly.  Mismatched religious or political views, mismatched views on family/kids, mismatched life goals, mismatched expectations from a relationship - all of that can be filtered out, at least somewhat.
