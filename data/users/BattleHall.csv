Yeah, no. This is a simulation of a gun-based C-RAM system, which as the name implies is intended for countering rockets, artillery, and mortars. They have limited to no utility against SRBMs et al due to the angle and speed of approach, which is why AFAIK they are not even being looked at for ABM duty, on land or at sea. Honestly, they're already kind of marginal against their intended threats. They are decent against singular slow moving threats (insurgents huck a couple mortars at your base, then scoot), but they suffer from saturation attacks really quickly. They also have limited magazine depth and *really* short ranges, comparatively. Basically, at the point where your best option is to try and hose down the incoming with a stream of bullets, you're already pretty boned. As far as the Iran attack goes, AFAIK it's been pretty well acknowledged that there were no THAAD or Patriot PAC-3 assets in the area, and the number of reported launches in Iran largely correlates with the satellite images of the impacts on the US base, minus a percentage which failed in flight (no evidence that those were intercepted)."

IIRC, MANPADs were most effective against the Russians early on. The high altitudes and steep valleys of Afghanistan are tough terrain for helicopters, and at first the Russians were sitting ducks (flying predictable repeated paths through valleys with minimal room or power to maneuver). They also hit them as they were coming back to base, where they knew they’d be in a predictable hover. Once they realized the scope of the issue, the Russians changed their tactics, flying much more unpredictable routes at higher speeds and altitudes and clearing larger defensive areas around their bases. With that, their losses to MANPADs went down significantly. When the US went in, they had the benefit of learning from the Russians mistakes, though the actual MANPAD threat on the ground was obviously much less as well (the CIA wasn’t supplying the Taliban with brand new shiny Stingers)."

> Client identity is 100% confidential information. In practice, this will generally not really matter that often (obviously if you are going to the courthouse with them, it isn't confidential), but it is for exactly cases like this that it DOES matter.
Think of it like this. If I run a really successful firm that deals 99% with managing hostile takeovers of big companies, and Company X who is planning a big takeover wants to engage my firm's services because they are planning in two years of doing a hostile takeover of a big company, then it could potentially be catastrophic for that company's plans if I then go out and announce ""We just got Company X!!!""
The mere fact that a person has engaged a lawyer is potentially important information, and clients have a right to conduct their legal affairs in private.


Are you sure? From what I’ve found from poking around a bit, client identity as a general rule is *not* considered privileged information, except in certain specific situations, usually related to whether revealing the lawyer-client relationship would cause material issue for the client (which it seems like your hypothetical would fall under). It appears that this is generally not an issue if the relationship has already been publicly acknowledged in a way that would be reasonably easy to ascertain (like representing someone publicly in court). I still haven’t found anything, though, that addresses whether an attorney is ethically barred from simply identifying a former client in general, especially divorced from any indication of representation (i.e. “I think that may be John Q”, versus “That may be my former client, John Q”), even if the context for their former association may have been as a client. Do you have a cite?

Or, maybe a slightly weirder hypothetical. Lawyer represents Client in a public matter. Representation is uneventful, matter is ended, and lawyer is not retained. A year later, Lawyer is assaulted in the street by an unknown subject. The subject doesn’t say anything or identify themselves, but the Lawyer gets a good look at their face, and it is clearly (to them) their former Client. Is the Lawyer ethically barred from identifying their former Client to the police as part of the assault investigation, as the only reason that the Lawyer knows who the Client is on sight is due to their previous lawyer-client relationship."

It’s not based on anything that was revealed to the lawyer in confidence, any person who had seen them together for any reason would know the same information, and it doesn’t involve the case the lawyer was hired to work. If a lawyer saw a client/former client on a “Wanted: Unknown Perp”  notice, would they be ethically barred from identifying them?"

This is why you see different barrel twists.

To clarify, barrel length doesn’t really directly affect spin stabilization. The rate of spin for a projectile is determined by the rifling rate and the muzzle velocity. Generally, all other things being equal, a longer barrel will equal a higher muzzle velocity and therefore more stabilization, but if you were able to fire the same projectile at the same velocity from a 30” inch barrel and a 10” barrel, they should have the same stabilization (though the 10” will probably have more muzzle venting irregularities due to the higher exit pressure)."

Keep stirring and then add your stock, and it should smooth/dissolve right out.

Personal preference: Dark dark brown roux for your sausage/turkey/duck/etc gumbos, and medium dark brown for your crab/shrimp/seafood gumbos. Filé over okra, but I like okra too."

They sell them commercially, they can be slipped over the end of irrigation syringes (so you can measure individually how much they are eating), or they can fit in holes drilled in just about any container or small commercial feeder. They are also removable, replaceable, and individually washable/sterilizable. The design in the OP is pretty neat if you are already set up to cast food-grade silicone, but otherwise there are probably easier/cheaper/more scalable solutions."

I find myself in a lot of different HEBs, and they can vary wildly in that regard. The 4 Points HEB has an Asian section about twice the size of most others, and the Hancock HEB has an admirably well stocked Indian selection. Obviously the Far West HEB has all the Kosher stuff. Etc. Same thing with the produce. Some have a crazy variety, but some (like Lakeway) have a ton of stuff but mostly pre-packaged/prepped, which I think also reflects their customers."

It's right across from the Belterra development (1600 acres, ~2000 homesites) and the new Belterra Village shopping area (Breed & Co, Sky Cinema, etc). Sounds like it was a money pit, and I'm not sure it's worth 6M, but if someone wanted to do a steakhouse play like Steiner Ranch Steakhouse, it probably wouldn't be a terrible location. Given the buildout, I'm not sure how you could ever service the note with chips and salsa.

Edit: Oh yeah, forgot my favorite part. If you go to that listing and look at the pics of the bar, notice anything funny about those walls/windows?

I drive by five different HEBs between my home and work, and I think my record for most HEBs gone to in a single day is around seven. I will say, though, that there is a lot of variance, mostly depending on the surrounding area and how long it has been since it was renovated. There are excellent HEBs and crappy HEBs, but even a crappy HEB is better than no HEB."

When a swing of a couple people can represent a 50% reduction, it’s hard to draw conclusions on how much to attribute to any particular directed action.
