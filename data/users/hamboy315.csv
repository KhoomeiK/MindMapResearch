This game is perfect. Random encounters are pleasantly avoidable, the training areas are super effective, you can skip so much filler dialogue/cutscenes, cool aesthetics. 

I was so blown away. This game is incredible."

NintendoSwitchDeals,fejxoat,t3_epgnnz,1579188213.0,"Downvote me, idc, but I’m gonna tell everyone what I wish I heard before I bought it. IT’S SO BORING. Like, it would’ve been so much better as an indie film made in this art style. Or better yet, just watch a full play through of it (without people talking). It’s actually more annoying to have to press buttons and move around than it is to sit there and passively watch it. And I’ve played a bunch of visual novel games. It’s aesthetically pretty average/below average. The story is decent. The music is incredible. Possibly the best soundtrack to any video game, which makes it so tough for me to call it boring.


But honestly, you’ll hear praise and it might be warranted. It might be one of your favorite games. But beware, IT’S SO BORING. And that’s not a bad thing. Mad Men is a real boring show but one of my favs."

SandersForPresident,fed8b0l,t3_eoe9bz,1579003425.0,"I paid like 800/month for insurance (wasn’t making too much at the time) and co pays and deductibles were really wearing me down. No body even took my insurance. I’d have to pay 100 just to see a doctor. 

I finally called them and was like “yo, I’m making x amount per year, I can’t afford this” and they cancelled my insurance and told me that I was ineligible. 

I thought I was fucked. I called the free state health insurance and they got me settled. I now pay $0 a month with NO deductibles. I couldn’t be happier and finally feel like I’m in a safe place. There’s nothing like being too broke to go to the hospital....
