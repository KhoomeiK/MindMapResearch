No, except that they're heavily influenced by the classic Nordic Black Metal sound. 

For stuff like Sargeist and Horna, a lot of Finnish Black Metal bands have that sound: Behexen, Satanic Warmaster, Baptism, etc. Non-Finnish bands with similar sound include InThyFlesh, FIN, and Void Omnia. 

One of the most unique (and arguably better than all the above) Finnish Black Metal bands is Black Crucifixion. Check out their EP Promethean Gift.

I can't deny your experience, but the original comment and your reply do sound like they're romanticizing poverty. 

> in all my travels the difference is inequality. In countries where there is a vast gap between the ultra-rich and the very poor, poverty is dismal, depressing, and a brutal existence.

I don't see how this would affect weather poverty causes suffering or not. And even then, that's strange in this case because Guatemala has [one of the worst inequality gaps in the Western Hemisphere.](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/guatemala/overview) 

> But in countries where the entire citizenry is at a similar level of wealth, and as long as the government isn't some brutal dictatorship, the citizens tend to be really surprisingly incredible and happy.

This is certainly not the case of Guatemala or Central America in general. Sure, most of the citizenry is on a similar wealth level because of the dismal levels of oppression and poverty. The countries aren't brutal dictatorships anymore (a very recent development), but the institutionalized repression of the dictatorships are still [very much alive. ](https://www.insightcrime.org/guatemala-organized-crime-news/ciacs/)

In any case, I agree that poor people are more gracious because they learn to appreciate the small, basic necessities of life. But when you paint poverty in nice terms like that it washes over the brutal life people have to suffer through just to have enough food for the day - if they're lucky."
