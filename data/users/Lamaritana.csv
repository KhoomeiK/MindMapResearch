bipolar,ff4b2h9,t3_erj3a7,1579559462.0,"I am SO angry for being bipolar. My life would have been so different if I wasn't. I could have been academically so successful. I see all the mistakes I made with others and friends I've hurt because I was manic. Fuck this.

Best advice I can give is too be careful with your sleep and don't exhaust yourself. Also find a good doctor who know what they're doing."

bipolar,febwp5u,t3_eo75xe,1578963586.0,"That's something I thought about recently. I'm really invested in the online militant community and that kind of stuff tends to show under all the peer support and help and knowledge (which is great). When people say 'you're valid' so much they tend to complain in their current state, posting 'whoa I feel like killing myself' (I don't even exaggerate). And when can you say no, no you can't stay like this you have to get your life together? Because before you see it you're cancel. Ehhh mate, I hate that shit. 

I'm so happy you got the job, you deserve it! Congrats and keep going"

sex,fdz467e,t3_enew39,1578786481.0,I wouldn't 'help a guy out'. But I would enthusiastically sleep with a guy I find attractive.

bipolar,fdyww86,t1_fdyvvap,1578784349.0,And without insurance at an in network pharmacy? That's way way cheaper that what I thought.

AmItheAsshole,fdw8lhv,t3_en6hb4,1578756201.0,"NTA at all. I didn't cry at my brother's funeral. I felt like it would have been inappropriate. And his death was tragic, he odded because of bad pills he had bought on the dark web (do not ever do that). He just had turned 23 a few weeks before and I was about to turn 18. Focus on the good and grieve how you feel is the best for you."
bipolar,fdjg5mn,t1_fdj1lpt,1578469367.0,"While I see what you mean and agree with you to some extent, you just can't compare a physical illness with a mental illness. You cannot treat madness and blood clots the same way. Because when you have a mental illness, doctors -and the rest of the population- tend to diminish you and treat you like less capable to make decisions, less reliable. Especially with a illness that can include psychotic symptoms. 

When I tell a doctor I'm scared my ex might hurt me I need her not to think it's the illness talking, because I have enough with the potential homophobia of the person facing me (yes, lesbians have drama too). And EVEN if it was paranoia, I am still in distress and I need her not to dismiss it."
bipolar,fdinw33,t3_ell3ko,1578447097.0,Yeah starting at 100mg is too much. Even when you're already taking for a long time it's recommended not to increase by more than 50mg a week. You can start at 50mg then 100mg after a week. Preferably at night so you avoid the dizziness that can happen at the beginning in the day time.
bipolar,fdiia90,t1_fdibd26,1578443533.0,"If it's mixed then it's hypomania. Lithium doesn't directly helps with depression, but by treating mania it protects of depression. Mania tires your brain and makes more likely to be depressed. I hope you can find a good doc!"
bipolar,fdhub36,t3_elfgs6,1578430281.0,"If lithium works on you, it means it works on mania and you like have bipolar disorder and not just 'mixed depression'. It's only be a month so you might want to wait a bit longer to see how it really affects you. Antipsychotics aren't mandatory. But you might need lamictal to help with the downs. It's an association that works really well. 

For the phytotherapie part, well I don't what you could try. Saint John's wort has to be avoid I think? Relaxing herbal tea maybe."
bipolar,fdhs6a0,t3_elf6hq,1578429143.0,Abilify worked as wonder for me for a while. But here you need to switch to something else

bipolar,fcbp5fc,t1_fcbin1c,1577589424.0,"Guy cut his own ear during a psychotic episode, he was definitely not 'just depressed'. He painted a lot of stuff while manic. I went to visit the museum a year ago, they openly talk about it and it felt so good!"
bipolar,fbsv964,t3_eebpog,1577061197.0,Might be yours. Paternity test will say
