india,fcxgz03,t3_ejes3k,1578062675.0,"Hello there. I‚Äôve been away from india for a while now and would like to get myself informed about the major incidents and pressing issues. Unfortunately I have only seen incongruent information across media and internet, leaving me in confusion as to what I shall believe and what I shouldn‚Äôt. Being part of alt news, you‚Äôre most likely going to promote that - but I‚Äôd like to request you to point out how I shall check for news by weighing it? Yes there is bias check websites for media in general, but fact check is another thing. Would you please recommend me a source or two besides yours to follow for news?"
AskReddit,fcvrhxk,t1_fcvq16v,1578008453.0,"Friendship is a bit like a family, only difference is you get to choose the people you can get close to. I‚Äôm sorry you haven‚Äôt had the chance to experience it thus far, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll come across good people as well. Trusting people can be a difficulty at times when you‚Äôve been through what you have - but remember to not confuse trust with your expectations on someone. As someone pointed out previously it isn‚Äôt a necessity to have friends, but having a friend can be nice. Do give someone a chance and try socializing; it‚Äôs not a given that you‚Äôll find a friend immediately but the more you expose yourself to socializing the more easier it gets in keeping the right people for yourself and filtering out the negativities around you. Good luck and wish you a happy new year."

[edit: seriously though, quick thinking can help at times but in a scenario where you‚Äôre in front of a beast that could kill you any second, surprise works at times against the creature if you‚Äôre prepared but for the major part luck is what plays a role here]"
