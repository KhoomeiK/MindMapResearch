Now i silently mock every aggressive caller and respond in the most friendly know it all tone i can, it pisses them off, but im still answering their questions, so what can they do?

i sit in silence until they ask ""are you there?"" and then i continue talking about whatever i was talking about before they started to be a dick. If it gets bad enough im allowed to do the whole ""if you dont keep this professional i will disconnect the call"" but have never gotten to that point. When you are assertive and straight forward with your answers they loose the tough act. 

From what I have found out people really just want a strong answer, even if its bad, they will appreciate the honesty."

scoliosis,fdookxd,t3_em75we,1578609411.0,"I didnt really have any pain either, but i felt uneven. And i felt like something was wrong with my body. When i got diagnosed and told i was going into surgery, it was scary, and fast, i got diagnosed and went into surgery a few months later, at the beginning of summer. This was in middle school 7 years ago. I felt so much better afterwards and i felt normal. Its not necessarily about pain right now, but it will help right now and it will help with pain the future. 

The surgery may seen big and scary, which it is definently going to be something to get used to, but it is only helpful. I was in the hospital for a week (which is long, but they kept me because i was having issues keeping food down, but I'm anemic so that another issue.) They had me standing right after the surgery, for only a few seconds, but they want you to be mobile asap. I grew 3 inches! and i was sleeping a lot after the surgery.

Long term, i had a large fusion and a large curve 70Â° operation was 7.5 years ago, i can still move around, there are no issues with quality of life, the only thing is sometimes you have to learn how to do things differently, like turning with your whole body. 

There are no downsides to getting this surgery right now, and if you don't, can only make things worse down the line, doctors will do xrays and MRI's to make sure she has stopped growing before they even do the surgery, so keep that in mind, but if they suggest surgery asap, i would do it, specially with that curve that looks pretty similar to mine."

I'm sorry you had a terrible time, most people on these apps are just looking for a quick nut, so unfortunately they're not going to be very gentle. A proper person would have checked on you and at least used some spit  and a condom.

Don't be ashamed, you were under the influence, and you were experimenting. Unfortunately you happened to be doing both at the same time. Nothing to be ashamed of when exploring your sexuality, but you should be careful if you choose to test the waters again. Best not to try new things while high, i have learned.

scoliosis,fdf2awc,t3_eky968,1578351686.0," 70Â° curve fused 7 years ago!

1. Depends on how fast your recovery is, i encourage you to try and reach out to your doctor about this! But i had my surgery at the beginning of summer, and then was back to school by the end, rode my bike to and from every day!

2. hell yeah i grew 3 inches, if your curve is that big i would expect something along these lines!

3. Laying down and then walking. Laying down feels best after surgery, and then you'll want to be walking a bit at least to get used to everything and get that healing process started.

4. There's really no pain if they keep you medicated lol, i don't remember any pain really, but they do give you quite a bit of pain meds. But like months to years afterwards, really no pain unless you move a way you're not supposed to, and also they encourage you to work out your core muscles any way you can cause it helps with pain. 

5. Basic living, it really really depends on your fusion. I dont really notice it, except i obviously cant twist or bend really. I dont think it impedes my daily living really, its more that i just have to figure out how to do things differently."

Advice,fdcyt3f,t3_ekl1lv,1578288376.0,"I understand you feel upset about the situation, but unfortunately there is nothing to change what happened. Be careful about how you express yourself to her in this situation, this could be taken as disgust for your girlfriend, and honestly i find what you are doing scary. It happened, what happened was horrible, but you need to control yourself, for your girlfriend, anything you say or do will not change what happened, and you need to accept that. What you can do is be there for her, listen to her, tell her you're there for her whenever she's ready to talk. From what you described in your reaction, i personally wouldn't want to tell you about the situation again. 

This is a horrible situation to be put into but i highly encourage you to think about how your actions and emotions will affect her. Be there for her, but dont wildly show your emotions like that, that just scared me reading it, lightly encourage her to tell authorities or family members that can support her into handling the situation. Yes this does need to be addressed, but it needs to be addressed carefully, keeping in mind how sensitive this whole situations is for EVERYONE involved, including you. Keep a calm level head, and take care of it gracefully. you got this friend."
