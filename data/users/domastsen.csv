unpopularopinion,feh4gdh,t3_ep53xv,1579108942.0,"People like things that are bad for them or that the state thinks are bad for them. And weirdly banning things like that doesn’t seem to work unless you go all the way and basically have the death penalty for smoking a joint. Check what happened during the period when alcohol was banned in the states, or basically any country who went through the same stage. By legalising weed there will at least be a limit to how many prisons we can fill up with people who like weed. It’s also possible that we’ll even see a drop in crime if more people smoke weed compared to use alcohol considering only one of those two seem to make people violent and irate. 

I think it should be legalised but kept in the same drug box we have for alcohol and cigarettes. Don’t do it around kids, don’t make it legal for kids and teens, and preferably raise the age limit to 21 where I think the legal drinking age should be anyway for physiological reasons. (If possible all the way to 25 but I’m being somewhat realistic here)"

A lot of people end up in the “oh I can treat myself now” kind of mindset, and they end up having calorie dense treats pretty much every day. So if that’s what happened you need to deal with that mindset. If that’s not what’s happens you start by nailing down the details of what went wrong.

Edit: now that I read your post a bit less rushed I’m guessing the fact that you still hated yourself at the lower weight is your problem. So think about therapy?"
AskReddit,fcv65gu,t3_ej367z,1577995446.0,"Too much of it didn’t make much sense or was rushed. And a lot of stuff was shoehorned in. Character development in TLJ was either mostly ignored or backtracked and I don’t think they handled Carrie Fisher’s passing all that great. Either stick to what had already been recorded or commit to the CGI route. Instead we left with some uninspired comments and a couple of CGI bits. 

(Imagine if she’d been able to talk to Rey about certain revelations, about common ground between them, now what would have been more interesting.) 

Poe’s backstory felt forced and Finn’s lack of connection to his likewise. (Couldn’t the dude have been a bit more upset about all the stormtroopers they killed?) And as far as romance go I hope no one thinks that Kylo Ren/Ben is suitable as a boyfriend. 

Special effects were nice, a lot of the film was visually entertaining and things could have been better if there’d been a clearer vision for the trilogy instead of what we got."
AmItheAsshole,fcq4p04,t3_eiheje,1577878644.0,"Mate, I’m not gonna call anyone an arsehole here, because really this is all INFO. 

Your “courting” could it be seen as you just being a good friend, a best friend in fact? I know I’ve given gifts for close friends and done them favours and so on. And my friends do the same thing in return. If one of my friends revealed it was done in the spirit of ending up in a romantic relationship ship and not as a sign of a friendship I would feel weirded out like fuck. Obviously we weren’t in agreement of what was happening with the relationship, and it would almost feel like they’d lied to me since they definitely didn’t tell me what they were really thinking. 

Or you’ve made it clear that you’ve got a romantic interest but appreciate being friends. And then your “close friend” got upset because now that they’ve broken up she thinks you have a shot and she doesn’t appreciate that. But seeing as you don’t write anything about what the object of your affections think about all this it comes off as sorta creepy. Like you’ve not even mentioned if the girl in question is even bi or if you’re holding the same sort of hope for her sexuality as you did for her availability."

The idea for a jury is that they should judge based on what’s said in the court, and I know there’s been jurors dismissed after it’s been revealed they’ve followed news reports of certain high profile trials. So what I’m arguing is that there are checks and balances in place to make that part of the proceedings reasonably unbiased. People also aren’t stupid enough to ignore a whole trial in favour of “aw shucks I saw them in the news they have to be guilty”. Of course you can’t control for personal biases, hence making a jury who stupid idea in the first place, but there are better motivations to get people without a conviction out of the news cycle."

relationship_advice,fclkosv,t3_ehucwh,1577750032.0,"To answer the last question, you don’t and you have to take a step back. Your son is twenty years old and plenty old enough to chose to have sex with his girlfriend if he so wishes. Your morals aren’t his morals, that’s something all parents have to accept. He’s not an extension of you, he’s his own person who needs to make his own decisions. 

Your personal believes affects how you chose to live your life but it’s unfair if you decide that it has to affect how your grown son lives his. 

If you contact his professor I hope said professor laughs their head off at the weird request, because it’s a weird request. It’s one thing to try and protect kids from behaviour you as a parent deem dangerous but again, your son is 20, and it doesn’t sound like he’s doing anything risky."
AskReddit,fclil2e,t1_fclh6i6,1577748632.0,"I think a company can be plenty evil without treating all their employees like slaves. People in general aren’t pure evil.

What the general public think can’t affect the decision made by the court/judge/jury. They’re supposed to be impartial and if let’s say someone in the jury has indeed been affected by the media coverage then they should be dismissed. 

People are innocent until proven guilty and for that reason alone there’s no reason to go public with with their photo/identity until after a guilty verdict. The exception being if they’re not under custody and believed to be dangerous."
AskReddit,fclhuyh,t1_fclduej,1577748152.0,"It would instead put bias on how someone sounds. You wouldn’t get rid of all biases based on racism or sexism or whatever it’s called for rich/poor people, classism?

Besides that you’d also lose out on seeing body language during testimony, and how someone looks could also be relevant for certain types of trials. Maybe it’s not likely that the 100 lbs guy was the one beating up the former boxer. You can of course add that description as evidence, but since it’s a description that could still of course be biased by your reasoning so it couldn’t be permissible."

To give your bf some benefit of the doubt he might not get why this is something that should affect your plans seeing as you weren’t that close to this relative and he knows you’re not overly distraught. Some people (often young people) can have a very s straightforward approach to death as well, like, okay this person I didn’t know is dead, I can’t do anything to change it, let’s move on.

If your children picks life partners they (the children) definitely ought to love them, what they mother in law thinks is secondary. If she wants a family photo she  should include her children’s partners. 

Chosen family usually trumps blood because you’ve actually picked them. A lot of people love their relatives but they don’t necessarily like them.

Adults without any cognitive problems should be able to figure shit out on their own as well. I’ve seen the suggestion a few too many times that when someone is being a creep they should be treated gently with care and maybe they’ll see the light.
