Bass,ffg7dmw,t3_etb35z,1579900049.0,">and what kind of speaker to connect with the bass

Just a quick note about this, generally speaking, there's a few ways you can go with amps. You can either get a amp head and a speaker cab (as mentioned, important it's a bass speaker) or a combo amp. Combo amps are great for beginners because it's all in one, it's the head and cab all as one unit. Simple. The benefit of non-combos, you can switch the amp head or cab and they're typically easier to move for gigs, a lot of combos are built like tanks.

As mentioned, the bass, get whatever fits you and your budget."

yourmomshousepodcast,ffd2k45,t1_ffd08vg,1579812158.0,"My guess: If Robert took him up on the offer, they would have made it the next RPC video in the series. To me it reeked of ""we could get an episode of Horders out of this."" Going through all of his stuff, making him decide what's worth keeping and what should be thrown out. If they helped him out, without documentation, it would be a very nice gesture but there is probably a legal risk, yes."
