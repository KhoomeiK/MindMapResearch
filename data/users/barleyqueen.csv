AmItheAsshole,ffj9nut,t3_etre8y,1579993696.0,"YTA. I wouldn’t have closed it. I pay extra to choose window seats because I get super panicked and feel like everything is spinning when I can’t see out the window to confirm where the plane is and that we’re not crashing. My anxiety isn’t rational, but it’s real, disruptive, and horrible even with medication.

I also am photophobic, so I get it (I don’t use overhead lights at home and spend as much time in the dark as possible and never open my drapes) but I wear special glasses to reduce the pain and only take short flights. If you can handle your eyes being closed, you can get an eye mask. If you can’t, bring shades on the plane. It’s perfectly fine to wear sunglasses during a flight. 

If you are in the market for migraine glasses btw, I get mine from Axon Optics. You can send them any frames and they will fit them with the special lenses."

I had to change email addresses to get away from one “ex” who tried for years (in quotes because we went out like three or four times). Blocked on Facebook and other social media.

She isn’t as invested in your friendship as you are and I have been there (too many times) and this is over.

You are obviously not fat, but learning about the subject may help arm you against her insults and keep it from sending you on a spiral. Part of what fat positivity does is teach you that fat is a neutral adjective, not something to be ashamed of or embarrassed about. If you start to see the descriptor “fat” as neutral, it helps take the sting out of people describing you that way."

I think it is unreasonable to do more than pick a color and offer several styles from that dye lot so everyone can have an option to wear something they’ll be comfortable in, but I get you feel differently. I just don’t think kicking her out right away was the best idea if you wanted to preserve the friendship. You should have picked a dress that didn’t have the shoulder issue and if she refused to wear it or alter it to meet her needs, then you could have that convo gently with her."
