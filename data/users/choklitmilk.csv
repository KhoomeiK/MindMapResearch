Edit: Oh wow, a moderator removed a comment that was simply questioning OP and why they responded that way. How surprising"

AskReddit,febs6qu,t3_eo83cx,1578962079.0,"I myself think it would be an important thing to say, because lots of people are sexually attracted to different genitals. If you say, show up to the date looking like a woman, but have a penis, and you try to have sex with your date (who expected you to have a vagina) and you get offended when they feel uncomfortable or lied to because they don't like dicks, or can't have sex with them (for any reason) and you expect them to still have sex with you, you're the problem."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fdavrz4,t1_fd6ytoa,1578250877.0,She has coprolalia. She literally can't help it. People should be allowed to be what they want to be without judgement for what their disability does to them.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fd7n7ms,t1_fd7ieab,1578207070.0,"Yeah, exactly. A condition isn't the same for everyone else and you can't just claim to have word over everyone else that also has it, that experiences it in a different way. It boggles my mind seeing people arguing over this for woke points. She has a disability she obviously can't control, she wouldn't embarrass herself in public and potentially ruin her life/get herself sent to jail (she's said things to kids before I think that she regrets because of it?) for attention like that. This just isn't how it is. She didn't just say that to stir the pot. She's genuinely a nice girl and just wants to raise awareness for her disability, and be HERSELF without being told she's this or that because of her uncontrollable tics. It's not unheard of or impossible to shout slurs or bad things (even if it's specific) as a tic. I don't know why this is so controversial when it can obviously happen. They aren't just words your disability just bans out of the book because it ""knows"" that society says it's an awful word. It doesn't work like that. You can shout things you've heard before as tics. It just blows my mind."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fd7gjzp,t1_fd6b552,1578204153.0,"Yeah, honestly I don't think any of what she does is ""fake"" or for ""jokes"", I think she legitimately has a condition. And I feel like everyone who has this condition can have it a little bit differently, so it's hard to speak on her ""behalf"" even if you also have the condition. Like sure YOU don't yell obscenities because of your condition, but some people do. She most likely already feels shit about the fact that people think she's faking because of things she just can't stop doing"

iamatotalpieceofshit,fcz7vq9,t1_fcz4xs0,1578095450.0,Maybe twitter just had enough of the controversy. Either that or she remade her account and is in hiding because she's too much of a coward to face the consequences of her bigoted actions.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcz2wk6,t1_fcz22q9,1578092572.0,"Lmao, that is legit how it is though. And some people like it for some reason? Like isn't the point to treat them like human beings instead of put them on a pedestal (just like putting them below everyone) and treating them *differently*? It's so weird and uncomfortable how cult-ish some white people I see (especially young impressionable teenagers) act obsessively about minorities because of their guilt and weird feelings. Just treat other human beings like anybody else, it's not that hard to not be creepy and robotic about it."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcz1ouc,t1_fcz0el0,1578091883.0,"True. Like pretty much bending over to lick their toes and being like, super self-hating with the white guilt and treating your black friend like they're superior and the leader just because they're black to make up for being the white friend or something.
