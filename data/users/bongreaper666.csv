AskReddit,fek624i,t1_fek3li2,1579193363.0,"I enjoy all kinds of music besides metal as well, huge Radiohead and Pretty Lights fan, love me some Feeltwood Max and even Regina Spector got mad vibes, but if you want to broaden your music taste check out Tesseract or the latest album by The Contortionist for some good metal with clean vocals. Additionally there are instrumental bands like Scale the Summit and Animals as Leaders. 
One band I listened to recently with a bit of harsh vocals that I think some nonmetal listeners would enjoy is Foxing’s first album “The Albatross”,  also one of my old favorites  MeWithoutYou has found a lot of popularity recently as their sound has become cleaner overtime. I understand not liking the harsh vocals but hopefully you can appreciate some of the more technical aspects of the musicians. Look into mathrock if you want some spicy licks without the screamo such as This Town Needs Guns (“Animals” is their first album and my favorite) or Empire! Empire! I Was a Lonely Estate. Also stoner metal tends to have cleaner vocals like Sleep, Om, or Electric Wizard. Same goes for thrash like Municipal Waste. Who knows, soon enough you might be getting into Aborted Fetus, At the Ruins, and Necrophagist!"

AskReddit,fek2094,t1_fejxnb8,1579190912.0,"I’d say that explains your distaste for the battle jackets. Patches are big in the metal scene and studs and stuff are big within the punk scene. I’d be surprised if you found a metalhead or a punk who gave a damn about if their jacket looked “fashionable” or even “clean”.  It’s more about the representation and appreciation of the band and their artwork. As a side note, when you say “screamo” do you meany any harsh lyrics in general, or the sub genre of emo which uses harsh vocals in particular?"

I choose materials because it’s quickly growing with the use of software and hardware which allows us analyze functional properties of different materials and predict new materials with unique properties. I’ve always been a fan of that which makes up the rest of the world (cosmology and particle were some of my favorites in physics) so materials was my natural choice for engineering. None of what we do would be possible without the work of software and EE though, among the rest of the engineering disciplines. Just look at an electron microscope; all electrical engineering up in that bitch, and the software to analyze pixel intensity from an avalanche diode and report it as an image on the screen?
