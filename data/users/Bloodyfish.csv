worldnews,ff6g5lb,t1_ff64mzo,1579626477.0,"Israel treats Israeli Arabs far better than Iran treats Iranian Jews. They're actually represented in the government, for one, comprise 20% of Israel's population while Jews in Iran are less than a fraction of a percent of the population, and Israel has never arrested an Arab for trying to help other Arabs leave the country, whereas Iran has hanged at least one person for allegedly helping Jews get out of the country. Yeah, I'm sure all the Jews living in Iran are treated perfectly by the regime known for holocaust denial and general antisemitism."
worldnews,ff233fx,t1_ff22yk6,1579492484.0,"Yeah, that response won't impress anyone."
worldnews,ff22io7,t1_ff024z2,1579492042.0,Which of the claims in the article do you take issue with?
worldnews,fen34yi,t1_fen1mhg,1579275922.0,"Just their religion, culture, and the world's only Jewish nation? Who do you think you're fooling?"
worldnews,fen0tzh,t1_fem3sti,1579274441.0,"> That word doesn't mean what you think it means.

Are you going to explain that Jews are not the only Semitic group and therefore that word does not purely refer to racism against Jews? I've never seen anyone who isn't an antisemite make that claim."
worldnews,feagdgt,t1_feaakth,1578948405.0,Your ability to argue is going downhill fast. Take a deep breath and compose yourself.
worldnews,fea8kpp,t1_fea7jp7,1578945639.0,"Na, I'm just getting bored of your bad arguments. Israel is defending itself, and the people who want it destroyed condemn its defense as violent, as a violation of international law, or whatever else they want to toss at the wall in case it sticks. You keep trying to pass yourself off as impartial, but you're terrible at hiding your actual intentions."
worldnews,fea6jvj,t1_fea64cq,1578944929.0,"Good for them. So, what law did they break, who's enforcing this international law, and why should anyone care?"
worldnews,fea4bye,t1_fea1yqu,1578944240.0,"What has been Israeli policy? The blockade started in 2007 in response to rocket attacks. The border was put up to prevent arms being brought into Israel and suicide bombings. Everything is a clear response to attacks from Gaza, and it has been working pretty well."
worldnews,fea3v95,t1_fe9zcc4,1578944108.0,"He is speaking about the blockade, which began in 2007. The occupation began in 1967, after it was captured from Egypt, and the blockade began after the 2005 disengagement led to a sharp increase in attacks."
worldnews,fea1fel,t1_fe9ygb6,1578943338.0,"I hate that this has to be explained, but the year is 2020. Israel's policies are based on the situation in 2020. What exactly did you think that post was supposed to change?

Also, why aren't you mentioning Egypt and their part in the blockade?"
worldnews,fe9wraf,t1_fe9uf9m,1578942153.0,"They are protesting the symptom and not the cause. Hamas is the reason for the blockade. Hamas is the reason for the strict border. You keep trying to claim you don't support Hamas, but your arguments are veiled attempts to demand that Israel gives concessions to terrorists."
worldnews,fe9ovcy,t1_fe9nmaf,1578940128.0,I am arguing against this nonsensical argument that they're both the bad guys. Israel is by far the lesser evil. A few questionable actions from their side is not a reason to defend literal terrorists.
worldnews,fe9ncvb,t1_fe9jfrn,1578939704.0,"Going through them in order:

The EU is against settlements, and I'm personally not a fan of them either. That said, Area C is under Israeli administration, so that's a questionable one.

Amnesty International isn't too reliable here. They [recently condemned Israel for bombing a watchdog group](https://mobile.twitter.com/amnesty/status/1194289553038811136) that had actually been hit by a Hamas explosive, then blamed Israel for their mistake when they were corrected. 

Canada didn't do much to condemn Israel, just approved a UN condemnation. You know my thoughts on the UN already. This move is part of their push to get elected to the security council, as the Arab nations have a lot of votes (this is part of why there are so many resolutions on Israel). 

ICC is investigating allegations of war crimes on both sides of the conflict. Nowhere does this article state that they found Israel guilty. The Israeli allegations relate to the settlements anyway, which I am not fond of.

Posting articles without understanding the context behind them is really not all that impressive."
worldnews,fe9fuuq,t1_fe9e0mp,1578937203.0,"Haha, are you seriously bringing up UN resolutions about Israel? They've lost all meaning at this point. Remember when a committee decided that Israel was the only country worth condemning for women's rights issues? The UN is really not what you think it is, mate."
worldnews,fe9c0jc,t1_fe986et,1578936207.0,"Spelling mistakes? I suppose critical makes more sense, but I really would not put it past someone who makes claims about IQ to try to appear intelligent by referring to biology in such a pointless way. Anyway, which war crime accusations have stuck? And why do people conveniently ignore the war crimes constantly committed by Hamas? You make a lot of claims, but you refuse to provide any evidence."
worldnews,fe97j93,t1_fe96bf7,1578935055.0,"Once again, the people of Gaza, no matter how good they might be, are not a reason for Israel to allow their terrorist government to operate freely. Your arguments are weak, and the only reason I am responding is to laugh at nonsense like your ""cortical thinking"" claim. Keep em coming, bud."
worldnews,fe95hf2,t1_fe94l5o,1578934425.0,"And you are assuming the people in Gaza who aren't attacking the Israeli border are the ones Israel should be thinking about when they defend their border. Hamas is the problem, not Israel. 

Do you also think we should disband the police force because most people are not criminals?"
worldnews,fe942z3,t1_fe92w10,1578933995.0,"I'm surprised someone with such a high IQ doesn't understand what ""esque"" means. Anyway, on one side you have a democratic nation which is accused of defending itself too aggressively and on the other side we have a government that refuses to hold elections and has a special fund for paying the murderers of Jews and a literal terrorist group. But hey, they're both terrible, right?"
worldnews,fe91cbw,t1_fe8z9lj,1578933142.0,"Your 'very fine people on both sides' esque comments aren't adding any nuance to the situation. There is a military border, people are rioting there. Claiming those people should be allowed to attack the border because something something IQ just isn't helping. Your new claim about experience isn't improving the argument. All you're doing is telling us that we're wrong because of reasons you refuse to share."
worldnews,fe8y5gm,t1_fe8xq8d,1578932260.0,Reality and personal experience of what? Please tell us about this personal experience of yours. All you're doing is posting that everyone is wrong except you because of your unspecified experience and/or tepid IQ.
worldnews,fe8xljf,t1_fe8wq6f,1578932086.0,"So your post about your amazing IQ wasn't enough of a response, and I get a second post to laugh at? Thanks!"
worldnews,fe8xcli,t1_fe8w526,1578932008.0,"Oh boy, now you're claiming your views are correct because of your room temperature IQ and distrust of the media? You sure did prove us wrong, thanks mate."
worldnews,fe8v33s,t1_fe8jtx1,1578931266.0,So you've gone from claiming they're peaceful protestors to agreeing that they're rioters and claiming they're justified in their attacks?
worldnews,fe87bn8,t1_fe7ukzx,1578923388.0,"Are you talking about Tatars, a tiny minority that aren't mentioned once in the article you linked?

Who is falling for this crap?"
worldnews,fdqchb7,t1_fdplqb0,1578662941.0,I believe he meant the intelligence official from Iraq.
nottheonion,fdotxhi,t1_fdor28a,1578612793.0,Did they think it was a good approach? I thought the idea was that it's a Hail Mary to save someone who's going to die anyway.
worldnews,fdcdmgk,t1_fdcbtt4,1578272327.0,"So you think it would be fine for a hostile power to go into your home and murder your grandfather if he previously served in a war? What about your children, who may potentially serve at a future date?"
worldnews,fdc5k29,t1_fdc4yte,1578267531.0,And that's an excuse to attack civilians in your mind?
aww,fd64iuz,t1_fd5xa87,1578185425.0,"Are you thinking about red pandas? Giant pandas are in the bear family, while red pandas are closer to raccoons.

Did a bit of googling and bears and raccoons are apparently rather close."
TIHI,fcblkqw,t1_fcblag4,1577588273.0,Further? We've literally never spoken before.
TIHI,fcbl1n3,t1_fcbi83h,1577588104.0,"At no point during the fraud did anyone think they might be murdered. He claimed he had a gun. It was a violent crime, even if the gun was not real."
TIHI,fcbk7p6,t1_fcbjnug,1577587828.0,Please provide evidence for this claim that appears to have been pulled out of nowhere.
TIHI,fcbk160,t1_fcb9jpq,1577587770.0,"He didn't use deadly force but led the teller to believe that he would. It was still a violent crime, unlike fraud, and we have no idea if he was a repeat offender. There were also major mitigating factors in the CEO's case, who became CEO while the fraud was taking place and worked with investigators to convict the person in charge of the fraud.

But no, CEO bad, homeless good! Why read past the headlines when I can already have a knee jerk reaction without actual context?"
TIHI,fcbie3f,t3_egx402,1577587238.0,"How many times is this going to be posted? Violent crimes have higher penalties, and that is not some sort of societal failing. The homeless man told someone they had a gun to rob them, while the CEO wasn't even CEO when the fraud began and worked with investigators by testifying against the person who led the scheme.

[Here's a snopes article with way more detail.](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/homeless-man-vs-corporate-thief/)"
TIHI,fcbhm3k,t1_fcb8gv7,1577586970.0,He also didn't steal the money by saying he had a gun and making someone think they were at risk of being murdered.
facepalm,fbx5mdv,t1_fbwnrjw,1577170362.0,Are you talking about the lack of common sense involved in demanding that fraud get a more severe sentence than robbing someone at gunpoint?
facepalm,fbx5ku1,t1_fbwhyjj,1577170310.0,"Yes, but there's a big difference between fraud and robbing someone by telling them you have a gun."
facepalm,fbx5gi3,t1_fbwmgm9,1577170159.0,"He explained that to the police, not the teller. He told the teller he had a gun. 

Seriously, I've seen this posted a few times and the real facepalm is that people expect nonviolent crimes to get a more severe sentence than violent crimes."
Warframe,fbshgt1,t1_fbrwwvk,1577055274.0,I believe that came up when discussing the riven cap.
