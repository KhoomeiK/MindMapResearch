AskReddit,ffowcjr,t3_eu6iol,1580082558.0,I used to play computer games on this girly website. I think it was gurls.com and I typed in “girls.com” and it was a porn site. I must’ve been 6 at the time and I was so shocked and embarrassed. I had never seen anything like it. The computer was extremely slow and I couldn’t exit the page. I frantically yelled for my mom and she was so upset that the computer was frozen on a porn site. She blamed it on my older brother.
themaine,ffgfpmn,t3_eryjoa,1579905202.0,Meee! I'll be flying from Texas. I'm so glad they announced it early. Gives me enough time to save money and plan the trip.

Denton,feiz03j,t3_epdq9y,1579151221.0,I grew up in the rio grande valley and it sucks that there is no HEB here. That was my first experience with culture shock when I moved here. I thought HEB was everywhere lol
BeautyGuruChatter,fegyqqz,t1_fegjmv3,1579105502.0,Isn't that what Thomas Halbert did too? Moved to ATX. It seems like a few influencers are moving to Texas. Soon it'll be overpopulated here like it is in CA. lol

BeautyGuruChatter,fdeye3z,t3_el0tc3,1578349232.0,"I never really saw any chemistry between them, but then again Nate seems very shy and I wouldn't blame him if he wanted to step away from the limelight. I'm sure being filthy rich can get pretty lonely sometimes and you  tend to lose your purpose in the midst of fame. Maybe this lifestyle isn't for him which is perfectly okay."
BeautyGuruChatter,fdehztm,t3_ekvpso,1578339438.0,The lashes are too much and her face looks washed out. Definitely not his best work.

twentyonepilots,fd50unn,t1_fd4rstm,1578173069.0,Well I know that lol I wish they didn’t write it on his arm. It’s kind of distracting.
twentyonepilots,fd3za40,t1_fd3y9i0,1578162939.0,I get it. I just think it could’ve been written on the opposite corner or in the back side.
twentyonepilots,fd3wn96,t3_ek08ye,1578162280.0,This is a gift for my niece. Unfortunate it arrived too late for Christmas since I was out of town. I was a little surprised to see the sharpie writing on the front side. Idk it just looks kind of off especially since it’s on Tyler’s arm.

corgi,fcyry39,t1_fcyp55b,1578085801.0,"From what my in-laws told us, she was lethargic, drinking lots of water, her stomach area was swollen and she was breathing deeply/heavily. She went 2 days with these symptoms and was getting worse. Our inlaws finally took her to the vet and they immediately took her in.  As soon as the vet felt her belly, he knew exactly what was wrong with her. They still don't know the cause but she's on antibiotics. She's almost back to her old self so that's good! I'm still worried about her though."
corgi,fcylf23,t3_ejkvn1,1578082167.0,"My in-laws took her to the pet hospital over the Christmas break while we were on vacation. She stayed 2 nights while they tried to figure out what caused her liver to swell up. Poor girl almost died and we weren't in town to be with her. I'm relieved that she pulled through. She's still not back to normal but she's getting better everyday. 

Has this happened to anyone else??"

Dallas,fcy4j8g,t3_ejfdrm,1578074650.0,"I tried renewing my license on one of my vacation days earlier this week. I was visiting my hometown in south Texas. I was shocked that I was able to get an appointment that afternoon via there ""Get in Line online"" system. The system never works in DFW.

Well.. I showed up to DPS and checked in only to find out the the system was down for 2 hours and they couldn't process anyone. I left because they weren't sure if the system would come back up and it was already 2:30pm at that time. 

I'm driving with an expired license because I can't take time off of work to do it!! That was the only day I could renew it :("

AskReddit,fce1jve,t3_egwusn,1577615950.0,"My mom passed last month unexpectedly. She was sick but we expected her to make a full recovery. We were so shocked and I especially was so hurt because it happened just 2 weeks after my wedding and right before the holidays. 

Something my mom’s friend shared with me was so comforting. My mom was a cancer survivor and she made a friend at her cancer center. She told me my mom would encourage her and talk to her almost everyday. My mom was there for her and always told her to keep fighting even when her friend stopped getting treatment. My mom has always been a great friend to others. To hear that my mom had someone who understood what she went through was very comforting for me."
