youtubehaiku,feehiqc,t1_fedw5a8,1579033866.0,"It depends. It can be a contributing factor if you are doing it spontaneously in the comment section as opposed to it being a hobby. If it was an OP post, I would consider it more of a hobby, and that's not weird, but in the comments section it is kind of.

Of course, I don't know where the original 4chan post is, so I don't know if it was a response or an OP post but yeah."
engrish,fecl7i6,t1_feck06p,1578976650.0,I was saying that because the comment was unnecessary and didn't change what I thought about the picture. I guess I assumed that other people would think so too.
