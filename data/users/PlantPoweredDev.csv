It's as well crafted as it is unsettling. It's an amazing book that I never want to read again."

webdev,fehgwgr,t1_fehfkq5,1579116290.0,"As far as PHP frameworks go, it's a dream to work with IMO. It's very Rails / Django / .NET MVC so if those monolith batteries-included frameworks aren't your thing, then I can see that. 

I build a ton in serverless Node these days but opinionated frameworks (like Laravel) are still my fav personally. But, that's assuming the view layer is decoupled."
webdev,fehdxua,t1_fehddan,1579114562.0,"Oh it is? ... Wow. I'm not sure how to process this..

Hey everyone /u/mod-victim says PHP is dead so .. I guess we should delete Laravel and PHP while we're at it.   Thank you for breaking the news and thank you for your very fresh and brave take. 

lol"
webdev,fehczwz,t1_fehclt9,1579114018.0,"This depends on which hat we're wearing. If we're wearing the developer hat, then I would look at using a static site generator which load in about a 1/10th of that time (or less) and are absolute SEO monsters.

If we're wearing our business hat - if the oxygen builder is driving revenue & working, keep using that for now until you have the funds to optimize & build something better (e.g. static sites). 

But to answer your question, a simple brochure site, no, I wouldn't use Laravel. That's overkill."

I work in all three of these and this is so brutally true."

Over the past year I've been steering us toward Laravel for custom / complex builds and just yesterday the company put its first Laravel app into production.

I was born and raised in Jacksonville and that has a ring of truth, albiet one that other locals may want to deny: Jacksonville isn't a special place and it doesn't stand out as a better place to live than many many other similar sized cities. 

Jacksonville is a pretty bland city lacking a lot of culture, and people who think it has culture are the same people who've never lived anywhere else."
Jaguars,fci1plq,t1_fci11nl,1577656688.0,I hate how logical this is but it has the ring of truth to it.

smallbusiness,fc6h81n,t1_fc5sq5c,1577480512.0,"Paid ads do incredibly well in the hands of people who know how to run campaigns. Usually they'll run several very small budget campaigns with different ad copy & artwork and test to see how they do, then through sort of a Darwinian process, the highest performing sales copy and ad get a wide-audience blast. There's also the receiving end of this, which is your landing pages. They also need to convert well.

These are entire professions. If you have the budget to hire a paid ad company, go for it, if not, don't be discouraged, just learning the basics like how to run a few different micro-budget ads to figure out what is working will make your ROI _much_ higher.
