They undercut prices, underpaid their workers, and killed any small family owned business in the area.

The D&D Grocery (my grandparents names, Don and Dolores) was the type of place that made it possible to live in a small town. The elderly could come and get their groceries, parents could come every day after work and pick up good food their kids could grow up on (my dad, consequently, is a good cook partially as a result of working in this grocery as a kid).

What Walmart and Hyvee to a lower degree did was it killed these joints. My great uncle worked at my grandfathers store and while he never was rich, he had a life. Features like home delivery for groceries that was essential for elderly people that Hyvee is just now doing was done by my great uncle.

However, in my case, my jewish friends are ok. My gay friends are fine too, although in some context they arent accepted. Yelling at the people that dont accept them though isnt going to make them any friends.
