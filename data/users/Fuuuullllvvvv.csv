nextfuckinglevel,ffdqxa5,t1_ffdpfoc,1579826773.0,"I grew up in Quarryville PA and, thus the name, there were many in the area. One was quite large and sometime in the 70’s hit a natural spring and water filled it to the depths of 80+ft in places. Surrounded by 70+ft cliffs. 
One day in the late 80’s a friend of mine jumped from about 60ft and had his knees slightly bent in a sitting position...bruh, he blew his ass out. Like a legit tear in his starfish. I never jumped again. 
To be fair, I saw my share of people getting f’ed up hitting the water there, you had to jump out on account of the rocks and I think it got people leaning on impact which is a no-no."

It’s illegal for testing sites to look at your private parts so you can easily conceal the small tube and fill the cup with perfect temperature and ph balanced synthetic urine anytime. Heats up in less than an hour and you can get a belt that you wear under your underwear, too.

Edit: clearly if your test is for law enforcement/probation/parol then it’s not illegal for them to look at your private."
