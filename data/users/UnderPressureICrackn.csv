AskReddit,ffbxcdn,t3_ess07c,1579785814.0,I guess would be this edging I hear so much about. Any women ever partook? Is it even possible for women?
nottheonion,ff39f8m,t1_ff2wako,1579536795.0,I feel you. It's the same crap for me.. infuriating!.
mildlyinteresting,fes2g48,t1_ferzr30,1579360711.0,"Agreed. Even though it does get somethings wrong...one of the closest portrayals of addiction in a flick. At least the ones I have seen,"
AskReddit,fepblo0,t3_eq62yh,1579316547.0,"Feeeeeeeelings. Physical pain? Sure, just donâ€™t make me feel the feels I so desperately and successfully block out."

AskReddit,feis3v1,t1_fehy63a,1579145793.0,Definitely Down in a Hole...All the feels. The unplugged performance of that...seeing Layne just....look dead already...and still perform beautifully. It kills me . ðŸ˜¢
brakebills,fegxjuc,t1_fe8xleg,1579104761.0,The very same <3
webdev,featmyc,t1_fe9y5yz,1578952120.0,Yes! I am understanding it now. Thanks for your reply!
webdev,feat2qb,t1_fe98b49,1578951959.0,"I thank you...I think I was having a hard time understanding the true use of <div> because in my head, common sense tells me to use the tag for what the element actually is. And now I see if there is no sensible tag for an element..HUZZAH! <div>!  So, do people use them solely to help them in styling with CSS? Is it better to use classes and ids for that?"
webdev,fear1jl,t1_fe8v614,1578951450.0,"When you say a better way of writing the CSS, would you be talking about using classes and ids? And thank you for your reply, I am understanding the real use of <div> better now."
webdev,feapy14,t1_fe9jc8d,1578951207.0,"Ok thank you much for your reply. . I think me being a Noob...I wasnt quite sure what they were used for...I thought I was sure, but was wrong.  Classification/container for multiple elements. &  I know what the word semantic means...But it just now clicked in my head with HTML.  <3"
Supernatural,fe98lqj,t3_eo01y1,1578935379.0,Get the borax!
learnwebdev,fe8u4wn,t1_fe8thd0,1578930905.0,"Thank you! I get that divs should be used as wrappers and containers for layout purposes, but is that not what CSS is used for? Like adding classes or ids? Do all webdevs use CSS? Or not all do?"
webdev,fe8sy5t,t1_fe8s1z0,1578930401.0,"I see I see. Thank you for your input. I have just seen multiple articles concerning bla bla â€œdiv-itis â€œ is BAD. <div>s seem like good practice and useful to me. But I wasnâ€™t sure.
edit: spelling (jeez sorry)"
SuggestALaptop,fe81pey,t1_fe6sl86,1578921433.0,"I second this. I got my first-ever Lenovo. Iâ€™m very pleased with it. (Unless you will be dual booting Linux. That gave me some problems) but if not, go for a Lenovo ideapad"
SuggestALaptop,fe80vsv,t3_eo3ms4,1578921119.0,I like the Lenovo I have...but fair warning..if you will be trying to dual boot Linux...it may give you problems. I ended up swapping Linux for Windows completely. I read some other people were having issues with Lenovo dual boot. ~not sure if you were planning...but just in case :) if not...the Lenovo is a fantastic laptop.
Supernatural,fe7m51h,t1_fe71gtz,1578916312.0,"The star symbol is the fan part. The hashtag/quote is the organization and community that has helped countless amounts of people struggling with all forms of mental health. Kind of like the semi colon tattoo. I would say thatâ€™s meaningful. And since mental health will always be an issue, it will age just fine.  By the way, OP I fricken love your ink. Good on ya <3 AKF"

CasualConversation,fckcjrk,t3_ehkb18,1577722271.0,"Question for you if you don't mind?  ..first off. Fckin congrats on doing awesome!  I know first hand how hard it is. So.....seems I am doing the exact same as you. I've been coming down 2mg per week since 150mg. I'm down to 46mg. Question is just how bad was the w/d from methadone when you were completely finished?

Edit: screw the purists. Honestly the feat of just not living that way anymore is massive. Who cares how we stop."

AskReddit,fbtgzrw,t3_ee9uhe,1577078549.0,That we cant get laid without catching feelings. In my experience it's the other gender that always caught the feels.
