Because he's a shithead who knew he couldn't be touched legally and didn't give a fuck about his image. Kobe knew his brand would be irreversibly damaged by the allegation if he did nothing, and once it was clear he would win the legal case, he made that comment so that the victim wouldn't get harassed. His statement was basically that he didn't do anything wrong, but you shouldn't blame her for seeing it in a different light. 

Kobe also had a single incident and outside of that has been a stand-up guy, a great parent, and (by all accounts) since that one incident has been a great husband. He's been an icon and role-model for years. What has Captain Fatfuck done?

paradoxplaza,ffe3fai,t1_ffdsweb,1579835677.0,"Why would you assume it's going to be applied to new games immediately? No one is going to pay retail for CK3 and then a sub without more content. The most cynical view would be that they offer a subscription for it that lets you get content early, but that doesn't seem ""on-brand"" for Paradox. 

Moving forward, I would think they either hold off on this on all games until there's at least 3 major DLC, or they introduce a ""Paradox Pass"" that gives you access to all DLC across all games for a fixed rate. I'm not sure I understand the doom-saying this early. 

Also, of course these services will increase in cost over time, that's how inflation works. McDonalds has gone up like 300% over the past couple decades; why wouldn't games? I have no idea how everyone came to accept that games should be $50/$60 forever. They were probably overpriced early on, but the fact that consumers expect that game costs won't inflate is part of the reason that we see micro-transactions in games. $60 just doesn't buy the same amount of man-hours that it did in 1995, so either game costs have to go up, content has to go down, or other monetization options have to be explored. 

Predatory models like EA's FIFA shit should be called out, but just charging more for games isn't inherently bad. Paradox isn't trying to ambush anyone with these costs. Hell, if anything, they should give away a couple of the key DLC (Art of War for example) for free to sucker people in because the base game is so without them."

science,ff539pt,t1_ff4x8k8,1579579038.0,"Interesting, I found this quote from the article

> At the 12-month visit, only one participant was taking a medication for PTSD; nine others were taking medications for insomnia, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and anxiety.

I'm not versed in medical trials, but I wonder how they were able to establish that the effects were from the MDMA therapy and not the medications being taken. I know, for example, ADHD drugs (amphetamines) are sometimes used to great success in treating depression (off-label), so do they need to establish that there isn't come confounding factor? 

It also said in the article that the patients stopped medications ""5 half lives before starting MDMA,"" but I wonder if that means all medications. If 10 people were taking medications after the study ended, I wonder if certain medications were allowed during it. I think it's a little curious that 10 different participants are now on regiments for some chronic condition, but weren't throughout the study. 

Forgive me if I'm just being ignorant; I just imagine it's hard to get people suffering from something that severe to just discontinue whatever coping mechanisms they were using before for the sake of the trial. I trust there's good science behind it if the FDA is not only approving it, but rushing it out, I'm just curious how it all works."
explainlikeimfive,ff4wnn1,t1_ff43ojh,1579574229.0,"I'm a chemist and use both acetone and IPA on a daily basis. Acetone can do somethings better, but I'd recommend against using it unless you're absolutely sure you know what you're doing. People who work in nail salons often get health issues from exposure, and I expect more restrictive limits to be implemented soon. Acetone also eats through most plastics (you can see tables of what plastics are rated for acetone, but the answer is almost none) and that's just about the only way to make plastic dangerous to your health short of putting a plastic bag over your head. 

More importantly, if you're smoking something cleaned in acetone, please make sure you rinse it with IPA and then soak it in water. The small amount of acetone that doesn't evaporate is bad for you even when you're not inhaling it. 

Finally, there's a few other things to try. In general, extreme temperature is often useful. I haven't tried with weed, but I'd try submerging it in boiling water for a couple minutes, and then (when you can handle it) clean it with more warm running water. Similarly, you can try putting it in the freezer for ~20 minutes and then clean it with cold running water. I don't smoke so I don't know which is more useful, but if you're trying to clean something like jelly, using boiling hot water is significantly more effective than acetone is and poses no risk. Lastly, physical force is going to be more effective than soaking, so if you can put it in a container full of whatever solvent you're using (water, IPA, acetone) and then shake the shit out of it to move the solvent around, you'll likely find better results. You could also probably find a squirt bottle or something which allows you to build up a bunch of pressure, but I'd try just putting it in a plastic tub full of hot water and shaking it."

The conclusion is based on the dude in the tweet literally thanking God. So he's clearly religious. I'm drawing the conclusion that he's Christian because he appears to be American and black so the odds are like 90% that he's Christian rather than Jewish, Muslim, etc (plus Jews often believe it's wrong to spell out ""God""). 

The rest of your post is also stupid, but I'd like to draw special attention to:

> American Christianity is super heavy on . . . being paranoid of Jews

Which is especially stupid because America has (both currently and historically) had the best relationship with Jews. Antisemitism obviously exists (and if you had just said Christians at large I wouldn't have even mentioned this), but that point is just ignorant.

MathHelp,fdmaqt3,t3_em3bbt,1578544123.0,"To add on to the previous post, if you're solving a simple system like this, pick one variable (doesn't matter which, but probably the one with a coefficient that divides well) then solve for it and plug it into the other equation. In your example, if we solve for x in the second equation (chosen because it's easier to divide by 2) we get:

-2x = 8 + 2y; x = -4 - y

Then plug it into the first:

5(-4-y)+ 4y = 7

Keep in mind you need only as many equations as there are variables. If there's only 2 variables it's almost always faster to do it this way, but for more you'll end up basically constructing a matrix.

Edit: the above method gives you the value of y, then to get x you just plug the value you got for y into either equation and solve like you normally would."
