Therefore the xistance of those outside of male or female prove it wrong. If I said you either have 2 legs or arent human then the existance of those who lost an arm or had a birth defect proves you wrong.
UpliftingNews,ffcanb9,t1_ffc9aa1,1579795319.0,"""Then how do you differentiate between a kid with GD and a trans kid?"" With the already existing methodology that none of the studies followed, WPATH. And its already happening without large amounts of regret, 12 year olds are given puberty blockers, 16 year olds hormones. We are arguing for broader applications of those treatments since those treatments are saving teenagers lives. Younger than 16, every transition step is completely reversable. But puberty is not, and to be forced to go through puberty when you know its wrong and have a way to avoid it is torturous to the trans child. And countless trans children habe killed themselves because of this. And that seems to be something you support. 

Detransitioning after WPATH is followed is rare. And lower than trestments for many other conditions.

 I also question why you think you are right when you are arguing with what's supported by most of the trans community, do you think you really know better than us? Or that we have some agenda to make all the kids trans?"

Secondly, if someone desisted then they weren't fucking trans in the first place. The suicide attempt rates only apply to people who are trans. Not just diagnosed as trans. 

""This cancer kills 40% of all people who have it"" ""well what about these people falsely diagnosed, none of them died"" ""...well yeah, they didnt have cancer""

So if a child is trans, there is a 40% chance they will attempt suicide prior to being allowed to transition. Meaning, they are in significant distress, which means we can either get them out of that distress as fast as possible, and cut their chances of attempting down to a fourth, or we can keep them there for another 6 years.

Its fucking easy to see that denying children medical care that will lead to more suicide attempts is evil, and child abuse. And until you find a study that shows a majority desist even after using proper diagnostic criteria everything you say is child abuse encouraging lies."

Heres the chain I saw that convinced me. I dont know how experienced you are parsing this stuff, but theres a few red flags in there. First of all, the classic usong PC as an insult. Inaccurately wielding minority causes as a weapon against different minorities when its apparent they belong to neither group, such as using racial equality as a weapon against white women in that chain. That one comment that starts out bolded is actually spammed into several threads and poses a weird strawman. A user flaired Russian bot, which seems highly out of place unless they are owning it after being accused of being a Russian bot, which begs the question of why. And the user with that flair giving concessions to racists and expressing a preference to them over the PC crowd. All upvoted with no dissent or calling out.

But even still, there is a lot more to being a furry than the kink stuff. For me its a way to analyze dysphoria through a medium that wont hurt me as much. Having a way to express myself that is easily changeable and modifyable as I venture through my trans experience is very helpful. Its also a very friendly community, one where I don't really have to worry about bigots for the most part. And its one of the most consistent sources of positivity and happiness in my life.

tippytaps,fdjvwdz,t1_fdjvl4j,1578489229.0,"I don't give a fuck about legal definitions here. You end the life of another conscious being. To me, that is murder, you kill animals. That is abhorrent. You should feel bad about that."
tippytaps,fdjvsu8,t1_fdiu4ck,1578489139.0,"The fact that you think a burger is cheaper than rice beans and potatos shows me very thoroughly that facts don't seem to matter to you. There is no economy where a burger is going to be the cheapest form of available food. Meat is expensive. Even with all the government subsidies. 

And you certainly dont hate the animals being killed. You are, at best, neutral on needless animal murder."
tippytaps,fdjvmnk,t1_fdj1pb1,1578488983.0,"What a childish response. ""You dont like me kicking puppies, well ill go kick even more puppies"" ""take that you silly anti puppy kicking activist"". Grow up."

tippytaps,fdjvi33,t1_fdjv05h,1578488866.0,"You havent proven at all that vegetarianism is the cause of that deficiency, or that it couldnt be fixed easily if they were a richer country. All I will concede is that you have to put in a bit more effort into being vegetarian or vegan. But ive done this for years now and been fine. So ill continue to stand as an example against your belief. You dont need meat. You just want it."
tippytaps,fdjuedi,t1_fdji0uv,1578487823.0,38% of India is vegetarian and has been for generations....

tippytaps,fdiwsoo,t1_fdhb038,1578452821.0,"Hey doesnt this violate his whole ""no one vares what you think"" thing at the golden globes?"
tippytaps,fdirar0,t1_fdipp4f,1578449284.0,"I can talk just as much shit back. Like about how your sample size of 1 is an absolute embarrassment, rice beans and potatoes are all going to be cheaper than meat. Just because someone decides they want to go for more expensive options (fake meat, organic stuff) doesnt unmake that argument. Especially given how massively subsidized the meat and dairy industries are.

And I know I'm on the right side of the moral argument because I tried for far too long of a time to be on your side of it. Meat tasted good being a vegan was inconvenient, not tasty, and I thought vegans were annoying, unpleasant etc. But I was wrong, and I changed. Youd have to be a monster to see these animals and how they suffer and not feel the least bit bad for them. Genetically bred to become gross imitations of their former forms, subjected to a life of confinement, and murdered gruesomely and hacked apart for a shitty hamburger, which, thanks to our food system, half of which will probably go to waste. All of this because you cant allow yourself to care.

And yeah, of course I'm going to advocate for my ideology, what a stupid argument. Chosing to remain silent is chosing the side of the oppressor in every circumstance. People will speak up about injustice all the time, you only insist it be live and let live when you are the one aiding in commiting that injustice. Its hypocritical unless you think no one should try and address oppression ever, which would make you evil."
tippytaps,fdior35,t1_fdinwn3,1578447650.0,"Yes! You absolutely should make that choice because you CAN make that choice. The lion cannot, the dog cannot, not even other omnivore species can make that choice because we are the ones smart enough to have morals. You are a moral being and you have made a decision that animals lives are less important than a few minutes of pleasing one or two sensory organs. So do not try and tell me you feel any kinship with nature when you are so carelessly amused by its enslavement. You have chosen, you are choosing, and you can chose differently."
tippytaps,fdin6sk,t1_fdim85v,1578446654.0,"Its purpose was assigned by us and not them, That's the issue, animals are not our slaves, they are not ours to do as we please with. Why are you telling me about those sounds? I no longer support the industries that make them?

And you dont need meat. You need food, but not meat, you can survive without it as evidenced by the assive worldwide populations of vegans. Therefore your consumption is needless and they are dying for your pleasure and your pleasure alone."
tippytaps,fdilfne,t1_fdikf81,1578445524.0,"Before I try and make the case of you should care about animals, tell me why you arent fine with some abuse for some animals, but literal murder for others? Why is kicking a dog needlessly worse than shooting a bolt into the head of a cow for food you dont need?"
