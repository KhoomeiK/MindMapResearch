Colorado,ffb1u3j,t1_ffb0ema,1579749679.0,"I'm still young (24) so I don't have any sage market advice, but I can only foresee it getting more and more expensive as our population grows (and not just due to people moving here). I really want it to normalize though.

If all goes well with my job I should be able to work remotely, so, a small town in Nebraska until I can save enough to move back."
Colorado,ffauqag,t1_ffanvbl,1579744936.0,"Hey man I was born and raised here and don't work in a field where I can afford to live out here. We're in the same club. Might go drive up housing in the midwest with my Subaru Crosstrek drivin', granola eatan', trail hikin' crystal grippin hippiee' ways. 

At least there stuff is still kind of affordable. Maybe I'll afford to move back one day."
Colorado,ffahqu6,t1_ffah2z6,1579736020.0,Well I'm super glad you took off west and saw some of our state's beauty (and that it hopefully redeemed itself)!

Colorado,ff8gcd0,t1_ff860dw,1579677241.0,I always feel like DIA is such a huge letdown for everyone who thinks Colorado is just the rockies.

EmoScreamo,ff8g2ti,t3_es7l2g,1579676916.0,"I wouldn't say they're Screamo or Skramz, but Worthwhile has put out some insanely positive Melodic Hardcore. Just listen to this (short) [album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWsEYNA8Ty8&list=PL3F12FAAD07E4F458). Guy has a lot of love and respect for his father. It's endearing."

LetsTalkMusic,ff29l6r,t3_er7tsu,1579497868.0,"Wildlife is fucking immaculate. Peak La Dispute, imo, and it doesn’t hurt that it’s a concept album (I love concept albums)"
corgi,ff1n9xz,t1_fezu34j,1579482010.0,I know you’re getting downvoted but yeah... I wish their tails weren’t docked. When I get my corgi I’m calling up the breeder and asking if I can get one without a docked tail. Already did it with one breeder
ladispute,fesh5ke,t3_eqdx54,1579365041.0,"He's been praising this album non-stop since 2011 (and for very good reason). Check out his Pianos Become the Teeth review, his Touche Amore (Is Survived By) review, and his own review of Rooms of The House."
BlackPeopleTwitter,feehest,t3_eonc5y,1579033804.0,Oh lol I just have no idea what to say and apparently that’s how conversation™️ works I guess

Thank you!"

Hi there. I've been searching around for where I can find my ~/.profile, but I can't seem to locate it. I'm running KDE Neon. Where is it located?"

egg_irl,fdni5s0,t1_fdmnmga,1578586309.0,I’m here because I’m trying to collect every X_irl subreddit.
dankchristianmemes,fdnfl8i,t1_fdnfaay,1578584756.0,"Saying “hate the sin, love the sinner” is the same as me saying “hate Christianity, love the Christian.”

I get sick to death of people trying to feign acceptance of LGBTQ people with this line. You don’t accept them if you think unalterable parts of their identity are fundamentally flawed.

I’m also in a shit mood today."

Colorado,fdbms9v,t3_ekfdya,1578258938.0,Nice. I tried hiking to devils head today and it was buried in snow and the road was closed. Turned around after 2 hours of trying to hike to the trailhead.

starterpacks,fd46o2z,t3_ejw9wo,1578164909.0,Not a Christian myself anymore but there’s some great Christian hardcore bands out there too. Check out Worthwhile. Carry on Kid is one of the most uplifting hardcore records I’ve ever heard

WhitePeopleTwitter,fcwbopf,t1_fcvvj7z,1578021687.0,"Yep. Born and raised in Colorado as well, but I live with my parents since I can’t afford to move out. Unless I get a substantial raise, I’ll never be able to move out. And if I do that’s well over 60% of my paycheck to rent. I won’t be able to save shit on top of expenses."

TheLastAirbender,fc1z4su,t1_fc1tiva,1577334319.0,"Honestly, and this is coming from a HUGE fan of the show: you need to commit yourself to the full thing, or at least to episode 13. The first episodes are great in my opinion -- a near perfect example of character introduction and exposition (without it being heavy)

Please, give it a try. It's so, so, so good. And the MC is amazing"
TheLastAirbender,fc1h7zt,t1_fc1giqs,1577318690.0,Log Horizon was awesome. Loved it.
TheLastAirbender,fc1fgv3,t1_fc1e6xs,1577317187.0,"It’s happening. I think anime is becoming more and more mainstream with each passing year. Which is a grand thing.

Total plug but Steins;Gate just gotta voted anime of the decade so If you haven’t watched it yet then GET BUSY LAB MEMBER"
