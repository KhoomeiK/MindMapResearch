Conservative,ff9iqhm,t1_ff944ey,1579713874.0,"Exactly. Ride around naked on a bike even around children? Perfectly fine. Walk around with a gun on you because the CONSTITUTION says you can? RACIST! SEXIST! 

The latter actually happens every year in San Francisco. I've seen it and it's one of the most disgusting things I've seen, and I had my son there. I was very angry after that and just wanted to leave SF."
AnimalTextGifs,ff9i7m1,t3_es9sgm,1579713562.0,"Animal psychologists...is this cat experiencing something akin to a ""high"" humans get from drugs or even running? He seems almost addicted to the brush and like he wouldn't eat if you brushed him all day. Genuinely curious."
AskReddit,ff9hzdr,t1_ff8hhe8,1579713422.0,How do I know you're not misinforming me right now? HA! Checkmate Russia!

stevencrowder,ff4asmc,t3_erk5cp,1579559288.0,Nice try ANTIFA
holofractal,ff3n2jo,t1_ff2pj8c,1579544569.0,Oh wow I like this. You're kind of right metaphorically.
holofractal,ff3mnog,t3_er8o6g,1579544311.0,"Crazy idea... What if the big bang was a galactic version of a large Hadron collider? And the big bang was two lasers or some kind of energy on scales we can't measure. 

Is that technically possible? This universe is timeless because it is the creation of something that lasts forever rather than only a moment like we're capable of doing with laser in the LHC.

Maybe it was figured out how to capture that picosecond of extreme energy and make it last ""forever"". If that was possible, then you could potentially also add the energy over time, thus creating something as immense as our universe. I've also liked the idea of ""scale"". Like in Men In Black. We can't even comprehend how large the universe is. But what if the universe is actually very small compared to a perspective we can't see from? Like the ant theory. Ants think we're gigantic creatures, but then we think of the earth as gigantic. But yet the sun is hundreds or thousands of earths."
Rateme,ff3csx9,t3_er34ry,1579538576.0,"Trust me, no one above 30 wants to look older. Embrace your beauty. You're a solid 9/10 in my opinion. You look a lot like my ex wife. That's not an insult she's very attractive, even after our divorce lol."
bestof,fezp9w5,t3_eqwlhg,1579459954.0,"It amazes me how similar Narcissistic abuse is to many thousands of random people. I honestly wonder if theirs some gene, or malfunctioning genes, involved. Because almost every post in r/raisedbynarcissists could have been me writing about the (N) in my life. Literally 8 out of 10. It gives me my sanity to know that other people understand what I've gone through for 20 years. Because the very nature of narcissism is that others around you are manipulated into thinking that YOU'RE the crazy one, not the person abusing you. That's why many of us kill ourselves. The pressure from our Narc, combined with feeling outcast from society, is just too much. Especially if you actually think you might be wrong and you don't know about narcissism."
AskReddit,feytvha,t1_fexkvyc,1579450445.0,Because that's what heros do.
raisedbynarcissists,fel1cts,t3_epigda,1579211941.0,"Yeah this is one of those weird things you have to do living with narcs. I stopped wearing headphones for this exact reason. And she doesn't care if I'm on phone, reading or eating. I am expected to be open to her lectures or rants at any time."
raisedbynarcissists,fekzpeq,t3_eplz8k,1579210962.0,"""OH poor baby, are you gonna have a pity party for yourself?""

""You're just like your father""

""Oh yeah I'm such a bad mother. A bad mother who gives you a cell phone, a car, money. You're so ungrateful!""

""WHAT WAS THAT!?"" (When I made a noise upstairs)."
raisedbynarcissists,fehli8i,t1_feezywj,1579118971.0,Yeah same here. Nmom is always deriding people.
raisedbynarcissists,feez8vo,t3_eoshu5,1579044490.0,"Same here but alcoholic. I started drinking heavily after the divorce last year. Now she can't forget that. And God forbid I drink even a normal amount of alcohol. Her mood goes foul and she stomps around angry, trying to express her disappointment with you."
raisedbynarcissists,feez14s,t3_eop10m,1579044351.0,"My Nmom thinks she's a comedian. But she often makes inappropriate comments or jokes. She jokes with every customer service person she interacts with. And you can tell each one is laughing because they're paid to. Some just kind of ignore it. But if I don't laugh at her constant joking, she gets offended."
raisedbynarcissists,feeymrr,t3_eosg74,1579044091.0,Yes. She liked to gross me out or make me feel uncomfortable any way she can.
raisedbynarcissists,feeyh3d,t3_eoq7d9,1579043991.0,Around 23 or so. The full effect was realized probably around 26. And now even older I can see from a third party perspective how she has affected me.
raisedbynarcissists,feeycrh,t3_eoii0n,1579043912.0,N parents have no idea how they affect us literally PHYSICALLY. They think it's all mental. Poor mental health leads to poor physical health. Almost always. They will never take responsibility for what they did to you as a child they had full responsibility and obligation to raise to become and independent fully functioning adult.
raisedbynarcissists,feexz1z,t3_eoqugu,1579043666.0,"Wow...I could literally have written this about my Nmom and I wouldn't have to change much. They do not respect anything, especially your boundaries. And whenever you tell them they've stepped over the line, they act like you're so cruel and mean and not understanding of their situation, which is always SOOO bad. Due to their own doing of course. They are like a kid with a magnifying glass, and the world is full of ants. She loves to watch you squirm. It's literally disgusting. 

Yesterday for example, she overreacted to being unable to stop due to icy roads, and grabbed my thigh/knee instead of putting her hand over my chest. I told how I didn't like that, and she responded so hyperbolically and hysterically. Talking about how terrifying it was for her. 

She also likes to mentally/emotionally torture you. She'll mock you, degrade you, trick you, and fuck with your life without hesitation. Once, she took the carburetor out of my truck because she didn't want me to take it because it was hers. I literally just needed to take my GF to work."
raisedbynarcissists,feex5hy,t3_eoqix1,1579043140.0,"My Nmom has this paranoid delusion that people talk poorly about her behind her back. Of course, because she does this literally all the time...she talks about people like their robots who aren't acting properly. If everyone just did ""this"", then everything would be perfect. But of course, she herself doesn't actually do that."
Meditation,fec7bnt,t1_feaw4tf,1578967897.0,"Thank you for your reply. 

Being a parent is very difficult and stressful but rewarding. Seeing them progress. 

I am just worried that if something happens to them, how would I respond? Not healthily probably. And I want to nip that in the bud. In case it happens, because it does every day and hour. But also so I can learn to accept death for others as well as myself. It really scares me, and I avoid thinking about it because of that."
Meditation,fe9vsf7,t3_eo3t4y,1578941851.0,"Serious question.

How do I ""detach"" from my children and the possibility (like every human) that something bad might happen to them? 

I don't mean detach from them literally. I mean, not have a minor panic attack if I think of different scenarios that could happen and how I'd react."
AskReddit,fe58shb,t1_fe5845t,1578866615.0,Damn it's just a joke Mr. Serious.
AskReddit,fe4bcu3,t1_fe2u23m,1578857552.0,"You mean ""in case you run out of drugs"" right?"
AskReddit,fe4b9dg,t1_fe2tyb9,1578857519.0,DON'T JUST REACT TO THINGS!? That makes me irrationally angry and I'm going to break some furniture out of anger.
AskReddit,fe4b04i,t1_fe2s6pz,1578857424.0,Exactly. Learn from my mistakes. Otherwise you might find yourself living in a VAN DOWN BY THE RIVER!

Rateme,fdbpqnm,t3_eki5rf,1578259947.0,10/10
Rateme,fdbo71n,t3_ek7akj,1578259397.0,"6/10. Middle pic on the right is your best IMO. No insult intended here, but if you lost a little weight your rating would go up to an 8. You're really pretty and you have a nice body. And I like that you don't use makeup."
Rateme,fdbnkk9,t3_ekfy5y,1578259165.0,9/10 for sure. Your body is a 10 though most definitely. The 9 is because certain hair styles or outfits look better or worse on you.
AskReddit,fcgmapg,t1_fcfkguv,1577641689.0,I in fact did not want to Google that...but I did anyway and regret my decision.
LifeAfterNarcissism,fc31nw8,t3_efl6zd,1577379404.0,"I started doing this recently. Here's what I have so far...

-Looks back at me when I crack my knuckles to show her annoyance. 

-Repeats things multiple times. 

-Says ""I like this movie"" 2x within 2 minutes.

-Randomly announces what she bought me, despite my already seeing it. Or announces that she did some cleaning and you're supposed to thank her.

-Stares at you sometimes. Will break the awkwardness by asking you a question that shows she cares. Like ""how's your back"".

-Wears improper clothes for cold weather yet complains about the cold. At night wears thin dress yet she always complains about cold.

-Can't find things that are right in front of her. Thinks it's funny and cute.

-Can't remember things well. Forgets entire events. 

-Answers questions in a way that indicates she is assuming what you meant rather than actually what you mean. She always presumes the motive or intent, rather than just listen.

-Repeats a few dozen quotes throughout the day. 

-Unaware of her surroundings. Does a fake 'startle' when she's ""surprised"" and thinks it's funny.

-Drives poorly. Will look left or right and drift into another lane. Or at least drifts around her lane.

-Loses things frequently. Rarely knows where her keys are especially. Thinks it's hilarious. 

-Makes snide remarks to others while driving.

-Leaves lights on, and when asked about it, says it wasn't her. She forgets that she ever turned the lights on. 

-Has left the stove on 3 times. 

-Takes a long time to finish a sentence. Stutters and stops at every word or two, as if she already forgot what she was going to say. 

-Always trys to ""help"", even when it's not wanted. If you decline her ""help"", she either says in a manic voice ""I'm a HELPER!"" and laughs like it's funny. Or, she gets upset and slaps her thighs in exasperation, or says passive aggressively ""ok, whatever"".

-Thinks (knows) that people do passive aggressive things to her. Like if someone stops at the road, and puts on their seatbelt, she says they're ""putting on a big ""display"""" for her. When they're actually just going about their day, not thinking of her at all."
