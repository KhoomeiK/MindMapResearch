AskReddit,ffivt7d,t1_ffijbgi,1579983911.0,"It was helpful for practical reasons, but it also felt so good to have that empathy in that moment when I was really struggling. It was a small act for him but was incredibly meaningful for me. It also made me look for those moments where I could have that impact on someone else who is struggling. Sometimes it’s not about a lot of money, but about showing people that someone is willing to take a moment to help."
AskReddit,ffigl95,t3_ettjom,1579973375.0,"I had to take my daughter to urgent care one night when she was a baby. She had pneumonia and I went to the nearest 24 hour pharmacy. As I was walking back to my car juggling baby and purse my daughter threw up all over me. A man saw me and went back into the drug store and bought me some paper towels. I didn’t ask for him to do that. He just handed them to me and said, “I’ve been there”."

relationship_advice,ff8366v,t1_ff61y3z,1579664759.0,"It will be that way for awhile, but I promise it will get better. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other. You’re walking towards the light even if you don’t see it now."
relationship_advice,ff61pxi,t3_erv9up,1579616900.0,"I’m sorry, I think the only thing you can do is let time heal you. Keep busy and gradually you will think of him less. It will be imperceptible at first, but eventually you’ll think of him out of the blue and realize you’re over him."
AskReddit,ff61fby,t1_ff61agm,1579616678.0,"I have such respect for the level of patience teachers have. I couldn’t do it, I would go nuts."
AskReddit,ff30f81,t3_erdr5p,1579530316.0,"I always liked the lyrics in the hidden verse of The Boxer: now the years are rolling by me they are are rocking evenly, and I am older than I once was and younger than I’ll be that’s not unusual. Nor is it strange that after changes upon changes we are more or less the same."

AskReddit,fem21hj,t1_fem1cqt,1579237188.0,"Me too. I wish it didn’t bug me as much as it does, but I honestly find it distracting. I get caught up in the error and have a hard time focusing on the content."
foodhacks,fedhyut,t3_eolv3d,1579012000.0,Thank you. I will try this sometime.
AskReddit,fe6cfs6,t1_fe6cb3e,1578886905.0,That’s exactly what I was thinking.

AskReddit,fe4fz7r,t3_enscnh,1578858890.0,More clearly ask for my husband to go make or pick up some lunch. I’m really hungry and equally tired.

AskReddit,fdkf7t2,t3_elvb2r,1578502598.0,We woke up to a banging noise one morning. I looked over and it was our cat. He had a tissue box stuck on his head. He had backed himself into a corner trying to get it off and was just swinging his head around trying to dislodge the box. Always makes me smile thinking of that.
AskReddit,fdhcfsa,t3_ele7qp,1578419890.0,It is what it is.
AskReddit,fdbogi5,t1_fdbc5dn,1578259505.0,I’m so sorry.
AskReddit,fdbbufb,t3_ekigmg,1578255861.0,"I think it depends on whether you have the right partner. You need someone who respects your need for alone time and you need to be careful to build in together and alone time. It becomes more difficult with babies and young children, but is possible. I love my life and wouldn’t change it. I probably stay up later than I should because that is when I get most of my alone time."
AskReddit,fd9vv1w,t3_ekefgs,1578238705.0,"Because after I get the kids to bed and all of the evening stuff done and the pets settled, then it’s my time. I am usually reluctant for that time to come to an end so I end up staying up way too late."
funny,fd7eskw,t3_ek8uqd,1578203350.0,Thank you.
AskReddit,fd6nivj,t1_fd5gioy,1578193467.0,"I’m so sorry you have to deal with that . You raise an interesting point. I’m not sure where I feel like the line should be for where assisted suicide should be legal, but you’ve given me something to think about."
AskReddit,fd4p0na,t1_fd41tgo,1578169591.0,"I went with my neighbor to have her dog put down. It was actually what made me really think about the topic of assisted suicide. I thought it was such a gift she was giving him in ending his suffering. It made me wonder why we would do that for our pets but not people. I get that it’s a very complicated topic, though. There’s a line somewhere of when it should be okay and defining that line would be very difficult both morally and legally."
AskReddit,fd2z8kg,t3_ejy76m,1578153251.0,Assisted suicide. I think mentally sound people should be able to make decisions about how their lives end in the case of terminal illness.
relationship_advice,fd2ymls,t3_ejy3qd,1578153003.0,"She’s asking a lot of you for a new girlfriend. Those seem to me to be more the type of discussions you have when you are committing to a longer term relationship. I personally can’t ever see asking someone to delete pictures and other memories from a life before me unless it was having a negative impact on our relationship. Like if you were spending lots of time looking through them and obsessing and making comparisons, which doesn’t seem like the case here. As for the artwork, that’s a matter of taste. If you move in together it’s something you need to figure out, but not in early stages. Your girlfriend is over stepping in my opinion."
socialskills,fcz4vk2,t3_ejjte2,1578093712.0,"The other thing that’s interesting is that looking back on things, even if I remember an embarrassing moment, it’s unlikely that I remember the person. Just the thing that happened. We are more anonymous in some ways than we think."
socialskills,fcybn4r,t1_fcybex6,1578077738.0,I agree with this. Our embarrassing moments aren’t nearly as significant to other people as they are to us.

cats,fcvzntx,t3_ej7m2x,1578013760.0,Congratulations! He’s a cutie. When I saw 30 years old my mind completed the sentence and told me that the cat was 30 and I was shocked. The fact that you’re 30 makes a lot more sense.
cats,fcvza2c,t3_ej7lr6,1578013510.0,What a beautiful girl. I’m so sorry.
AskReddit,fctiavi,t3_eiu4fa,1577944227.0,The same way I would feel about a state religion. It’s wrong and pointless fo force a theology on someone.
cats,fcp5b7b,t3_eidkr5,1577850935.0,Oh my! She’s beautiful. She must be well loved and cared for to have lived to such an age.
