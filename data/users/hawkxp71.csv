NAZIs came into power, post WW1 trying to rebuild Germany.

personalfinance,fgd7hqm,t1_fgd65l6,1580679627.0,"That's likely the reason.  Severence, and other end of job payoffs, can be tax withheld at a much higher rate than normal.

I just went through this, changed jobs 1/1/20.  But final payoff for unused vacation came 1/15 and 1/31 (I did my old company a cash flow favor)

Unfortunately, besides having to pay extra social security in 2020 (which sucks....) the tax rate on the vacation was as if I had no withholdings.

Typically I would have had 1k taken out to fed, and 2200 was taken out.

Your severence (and maybe other end of job payouts) may have been paid out with a higher tax amount held.

So when you filed your taxes for 2018, you paid extra."

Without knowing your tax bracket, and assuming the 100 a month is taxable income thr net benefit after taxes is proabaly less than 75 dollars a month.

Sure it's free money.  But just use it to pay the 32k off that much faster."
personalfinance,fgd4icp,t3_exungn,1580678848.0,"If there is a local branch, go to the branch, with certified funds (bank check, or cash) and pay it against the loan.

If it's not truely local, and you are using a portal, you might be stuck that way.

However call them up, and ask them for the address of where to send a check to make a payment. Any funds you send will go against the principal.  Now, their system may, not take payments until the ""prepayment"" is used up.  If that's the case keep sending your normal montlyh payment via check till the car is paid off. 

It that doesn't work, Ie, no place to send the check.  Write a letter to their Ceo (should be Google-able) and to your states attorney General. State what is going on, and say, I'm simply trying to pay down my debt early, there is no prepayment penalty, and your company won't allow me to pay."

personalfinance,fgcz7si,t3_extc2s,1580677516.0,"I've been using TurboTax for almost 30 years.. Would never use anything else.

Initially, it just made sure the math was correct. Didn't really offer much advice.  It wasnt much more than a spreadsheet form, where you enter the values and it alrwady had the right equations in place.

In today's world, if you are solely a w2 employee, with limited donations and deductions, use any of the free versions, nothing really todo.

But as I've gotten older, with kids in college, homes, side business, investments, etc etc etc..  TurboTax has allowed for tons of efficiency in doing my taxes.

Can't do that in much of the world that is online...

So many Americans simply have never been to another country. We tend not to have passports for that reason.
