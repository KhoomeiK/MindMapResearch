danganronpa,fdy2vc6,t3_edf483,1578775443.0,"Hmmm. Whelp, hopefully I'm not necroposting but I've got a few, and If anyone wants me to go into more detail, I'll happily rant my heart out.

1. Kokichi is a better person than Nagito 

2. Souda sucks my guy

3. Kaede *is* one of the most well written characters in the franchise 

4. Sayaka isn't a bad character. Basic? Maybe. Bad? Not at all

5. Kodaka's Waifu isn't all that (*you know who I'm talking about*)

6. Kodaka probably *can* write sexual abuse, but shouldn't (I.e. Mikan and Kotoko)

7. Miu should've survived

8. Orange juice is amazing and Hajime has exquisite tastes

9. Komaru and Toko's friendship was valid

10. I actually liked the Monokubs

11. Izuru was a wasted potential 

12. Kaito isn't the Ultimate Bro 

13. I still believe Kaede should get a spin-off (WITH Kodaka's permission)

14. Danganronpa V3 was objectively unnecessary (however, I still enjoyed it)

I probably have more, but I'll save that for another UO post. Kudos"

*Trucy: MmmMMmm. Slab some Mayannaise on that and we have ourselves a tuna sandwich.*

(Crouching to her knees, the outline of her three bulges became much more apparent. Pearl quivered at Trucy's breath on her slimy Cock-killer. Her virgin self couldn't take it. And you know she's a virgin even though she's gaping due to alpha Trucy claiming her with a monster dragon/horse breed dildo.)

*Pearl: Puh-pub-please swallow my butt crack over that demolished car that got fucked by a dragon!!1!11!*

(Pearl looked longingly at the car with more than a little ride and tear. She got horny at the thought that she'd be in its same status soon; BLACKEND)

*Trucy: (looking deep into her eyes, licking her dry penguin beak) I knew I made the right decision of adopting a 7 y.o. that's gone through extreme familial trauma.*
