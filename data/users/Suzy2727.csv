relationships,ff43kaq,t3_erhaf3,1579554773.0,"I don't know If you'll get any satisfaction from your co-workers while you're still working with them. Finding another job seems like the best solution. But, until that happens, you mentioned when you were interviewed it was the assistant OM you spoke to. Could you talk to them and get some insight or support? I wonder if your family friend the OM is trying to stay very neutral in this situation given your personal history. She's not being very helpful by saying that she's the only person you 'have to' speak to during the work day. She must have known what a tight clique your co-workers had before you started. She's essentially telling you to completely ignore them all day, every day. Who the fuck would want to work in that evironment? Is it possible she told everyone that you are a family friend? The way your co-workers are behaving could be some misguided thinking that you're a spy for her, and you'll snitch to the OM with their infractions.  The woman who spoke to your co-worker about harassment while looking at you for example sounds like they want you to know they'll pull dirty tricks on you (lying to the OM about your behavior) before you can."

You can look after me (bring food over, ask if there's anything around the house that needs to be done etc.) But this is my baby. I look after my own baby."" I always thought that was a good way to put it to keep everyone in the right pecking order."

funny,fc9rkds,t3_egrpco,1577557146.0,"Ah, Carrie Fisher. She was so fucking funny. A couple of weeks ago I saw her on a rerun of The Graham Norton show. She was on with Daisy Ridley (promoting Star Wars The Force Awakens). Carrie gave her this wise piece of advice when Daisy showed up on the set to start filming. ""Don't go through the crew (pause) like wildfire."" Omfg I laughed so hard.

Edit: added movie"

There's a huge mural on the wall of Charlie Brown trying to kick the football that Lucy pulls away, and when you get up close it's made up of thousands of B&W strips of comics. Arranged so the shading from a distance makes up the big picture. One of many great things there. Loved it."
