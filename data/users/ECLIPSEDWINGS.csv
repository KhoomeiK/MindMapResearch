I am someone who is suffering with depression for around 7-8 years now. I always felt like I couldn’t fulfill my mission. Like an angel is portrayed as an messenger of god. So without the wings he cant complete his mission to deliver the message. So its pretty much a metaphor for how my depression held me back. However if I cant fly I can still walk  :)"
