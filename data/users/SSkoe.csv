I tend to side with the Republicans because I was raised in a Republican family. I don't agree with the Democrats on a lot of issues, but it's very difficult to come on Reddit and point out the nuances in the assumptions people make. 

Abortions. No, people should not be able to go around and get one willy-nilly. It enables irresponsible behavior sexual behavior. That doesn't mean I think a rape victim should be forced to carry, birth, and raise a living monument to their attack. You should not be forced to give a child a short, painful life when something can be done. You should not be forced to sacrifice your health if it becomes known that there will be serious complications. I'm not a fucking monster. But getting cold feet 3 months into a healthy pregnancy you initially wanted is absolutely disgusting to me. The prostitute that pops in every couple months is even worse.

Welfare. I get it, some people need it. But many don't. My wife has two cousins that have the same blood condition. The male just drinks all day, blames his blood condition on not being able to get a job, and collects his checks. His sister works as a server nights and weekends and stays at home with two boys under 2 years old during the day. Is it possible his overall health is far worse than hers? Maybe, but they're in their late 20s, and I think he's just milking it. Meanwhile I have an uncle who was injured during his time in the military. After he got out, he turned to carpentry and has multiple serious injuries on the job. At this point his body is just broken and done, and he has no means of supporting himself. He gets mad if we try to give him money, but he feels entitled to the money the government sends him because of his time in the service. I don't disagree. There are many people in a similar position.

Immigration. I don't have a problem with people moving to America. I have a problem with people coming to America illegally. Because if you can smuggle in poor desperate humans for next to nothing, what will you smuggle in if you're getting paid? Combatants, dangerous drugs, and weapons. Just fill out the damn paperwork so you're not supporting international criminal organizations. And yes, at least try to learn English! If I was going to emigrate to South Korea, I would make it a point to learn Korean. When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

Sorry for the rant, this was really meant for the people who say things like ""All Republicans are narcissists and evil!"" That just makes you sound like a Nazi purist. What I see is ""All people who disagree with me are the enemy!"" I'm not your enemy Reddit. If I see you fall, I'll offer a hand. And if we're ever invaded, I'll cover your asses with my weapons.

And for the record, I do NOT approve of Trump nor his actions. Our politicians think they're all celebrities. Anyone else remember that we were never supposed to have ""career-politicians""?"

worldnews,fddnin7,t1_fdcgz84,1578318720.0,"I'm trying to figure that out myself. What the actual fuck is going on right now? In all seriousness, why did our government launch this attack?

So far all I've learned is that Trump and some leaders at the Pentagon allegedly decided to kill this Iranian General. ""To stop a war"" they claim. Apparently some Iranian-backed militias have been engaging US troops in the region recently, and the situation has been escalating tensions. So this attack was launched. And now the people of Iran are pissed off.

Trump has stated that there are 52 culturally significant sites that will be targeted for destruction if attacks on US troops continue. That's fucked up. Remember all that footage of the museums getting ransacked and destroyed by Isis?

Iran has responded that they recognize their enemy as the is US military, not US citizens.

Sorry for the rant. Everything is a fucking shit show. It's impossible to know what's actually happening. I've got a full time job, online classes, a wife and baby boy to take care of, and I've been sick as fuck the past couple weeks so I have no clue if anything I said is accurate.
