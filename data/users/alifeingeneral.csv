Sino,ff0xiac,t3_er137v,1579473275.0,"Pharmaceuticals in the western world hold profit as the most important thing, above all else including human lives: With the billions of dollars in funding for medical research, one of the saddest thing is that minimal university and medical centers are looking into research for cures, they are only interested in finding long term treatments which can bring in long term financial gains. In fact, sometimes if they accidentally do find a cure, it’s better to hide those findings than to let it affect their current sales of medicines or treatment. This is truly humanity at It’s worst. 
But because pharmaceuticals hold the most power in western counties through lobbying and they get to pick  where the funding goes in the medical world, people will never see changes.
I truly hope to see the day when a government that will hold its own agenda and put people’s quality of life and the right to cures before profit and declare a change. When one finally set the example hopefully the rest will be forced to follow."

husky,fdsgcp8,t1_fdpz8tm,1578702178.0,"I can imagine. I’ve met a lot of very spoiled huskies. I don’t know why, I mean a lot of owners spoil their dogs regardless of the breed but when you spoil a husky they get really bad, and just don’t listen. Maybe huskies are a little too smart and they take advantage more when they are spoiled."
