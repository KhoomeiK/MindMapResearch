Just had my baby 3 months ago. The whole birth was...everything. The most important thing in my life. I was crying days later and hoping I never forgot it. And the few days after were just a dream, both in that it was woozy and delightful. And now he's a handful but he's so incredibly worth it. I wish you the same happiness."

I was saying his idea that people with ""a million things to do"" are just doing it for self-pity is bullshit. If I didn't do a million things, my family's life would fall apart, and anyone who has kids and owns a house can attest to the exact same thing. With kids you don't even have enough time to take a shit. And having a house means literally doing some sort of maintenance almost every weekend."

This comment acting like we're putting stuff down that we're not going to do... Yeah, no. If I don't do these things, it's bad. You can't just not pay bills or wash your clothes or not maintain your cars, that shit is how you turn into my parents with 3 broken down cars in the backyard because they don't stay on top of things, along with a dirty house with broken heating in the winter and yeah.

And this is the weekend because your week is filled with an exhausting 8-5 with an hour commute and in the evenings you literally only have time to cook and eat dinner and get the kid fed and to bed."

interestingasfuck,felao0w,t1_feksimc,1579217744.0,"I used to live there, and while the Alps are amazing, you're right that it is not perfect at all. The Swiss are generally xenophobes, and can be quite cold and rude, and it's really hard to make friends, especially if you don't speak perfect French (or swiss german). There was no night life, places closed really early and were closed on the weekend too. My husband, a vegetarian, could find almost nothing to eat at restaurants (they would always offer him fish). They had music festivals but no one would dance. The bureaucracy was insane, for instance they wouldn't let me and my (now) husband marry - they demanded written documentation from our home countries would recognize our marriage, and proof that we were not blood relatives. We explained that our countries do not have any documents for these things, so they demanded we get documents proving that the other documents didn't exist. I'm not kidding. We ended up flying to Cyprus for a weekend and getting married there.

But - visit the Alps. They're amazing.

Edit: Another fun example, I was skiing one weekend and got a chair lift slammed into my face (these were pieces of wood that you sit on pulled by a wire, I fell off mine by accident, and my husband behind me got off to help me, and his seat retracted into my face) and my front tooth was knocked in, split lip, blood everywhere, etc. I was crying and the swiss medic guy just told me to calm down, go home and go to the dentist. It was a sunday so of course no dentists were available. 0 beside manner or compassion."

If it does, then you have so many in this community to talk to about it. But on these types of posts, you never see ""this didn't happen to me"", only ""same, its so horrible!"" and it might make people think there is only one side to these things.

My body bounced back for the most part and I don't have a ton of problems. No incontinence, no pelvic floor issues, no weight problems. I look like I did before the pregnancy for the most part. I do have giant red permanent stretch marks but they look pretty neat IMO and they represent my journey so I'm pretty happy with them.

I'm only saying this because I read a lot of posts on babybumps and beyondthebump during and after pregnancy and was SO AFRAID of all the things that were happening to seemingly everyone on this sub, and therefore were definitely going to happen to me. I spent too many days crying and agonizing about what I was ""about to lose"". But it didn't happen. I spent so much time worrying about nothing. 

My advice: Just take each day as it comes - don't worry about things that haven't happened yet. Don't spend the mental energy agonizing over things that might not happen to you. Also drink so much water."
