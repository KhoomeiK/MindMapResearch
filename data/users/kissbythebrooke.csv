AccidentalRacism,ffbx2mu,t1_ffbffaa,1579785578.0,"You seem to be implying that you haven't discussed this topic with people, so isn't it possible that it is used differently outside of your social group? 

There are many people here in this post telling you (not necessarily directly) that the word has a long history of racist meaning. As far as I know, it doesn't have a non-racist meaning. Perhaps it means something you didn't think it means--that happens a lot. I know it's happened to me, with commonplace words that I made faulty inferences about, but also with words I didn't know were racial slurs (coon, for example). In those cases, I had to listen when someone told me I had it wrong. That's just how we learn. 

So, if you haven't thought about it before, maybe you should ask yourself why so many people would be upset by this word. Maybe look it up and see how it used outside of your social group. Maybe ask yourself why would you want to continue using a word that offends so many people?

Edit: I reread your comment, and noticed what might be a point of confusion. ""Jig"" by itself is a type of dance, and the word goes back to the 1500s, as far as I know there aren't racist meanings attached to the word used in that sense. ""Jigaboo"" is a much later word (1800s) that is linguistically unrelated to ""jig."""

femalefashionadvice,fenmdk1,t3_epzxcz,1579287780.0,"I have quite a few things that I have worn for many years, many of which I wear regularly (1-2 times a month). Surprisingly, none of them were purchased with any consideration for longevity. I was the same size between about 2004-2015, then heavy awhile, now back to my old size. I stored most of my clothes while I was heavy and have pulled them all back out. 

Converse--every time I have had a pair, they have lasted for ages and only got retired because of things that were my own damn fault, like getting bleach water on them--sad day to be sure. I've got my eye on a pair of the dainty women's style, so if anyone knows how the construction/longevity compares to the regular unisex low tops, I'd love to know! 


(2003) Black tie front cardigan (from Dillard's?). I've mended the underarm seams a few times, but it hasn't even faded.

(2004?) Embroidered zipper hoodie from Dillard's, weekly wear off and on through the years. Sometimes it doesn't seem to suit my style, but I always come back to it. 

(2007) pullover sweater from Target. Weekly wear through the winter months for about 7 or 8 years. They seem rough now, so I might put them in the dryer to soften as I used to before I took good care of my clothes.

(2007) Old Navy wide leg jeans, worn weekly. I'm actually about to crop these since that trend is in and my previous diy hem was a bit on the short side anyhow. 

(2008) butterfly printed cardigan from Old Navy. I wore this weekly for about 7 years, less frequently now as it is beginning to feel like it no longer suits me. 

(2009) Jansport sweatshirt with my college logo, worn 2-3 times weekly, even while I was heavy. I adore this sweatshirt. It has a subtle retro style with wide dolman sleeves, quarter zip, and slightly cropped length that hits just at the hip. The cuffs are beginning to fray, and red is so hard to match that I'm thinking of doing some visible mending with white or pale pink thread. I would pay good money for another one in pretty much any color if I could ever find one. 


(2013) Grace Karin cardigan (worn several times a week for 5 years), no fading or pilling. 


(2016) What Katie Did girdle (5-6 days a week for 3 years), not very old, but it still looks brand new despite nearly daily wear. Unlike the others, this piece was an investment piece that I knew would last because of its old fashioned construction. Unfortunately it's now too big (or fortunately! Haha), but I did get a second, slimmer, one for my wedding, but it's a different style I don't like as much."
BuyItForLife,felt57k,t1_fehyl9w,1579230292.0,"They do last a long while--I have had a pair last ten year with near daily wear--, but they are not made by First Nations people, so maybe try Wolf Den or The Silver Moccasin."

Youniqueamua,feknxsi,t1_fekij0f,1579203989.0,"It is very strange. I grew up in that sort of culture, but after some time away, it sounds very bizarre. 

When they say they've been placed in someone's life for some purpose, they are usually recognizing that they have an opportunity to convert them, or as they'd put it, ""minister to them,"" or ""love on them,"" or ""life them up."" They usually mean that they are about to seize that opportunity to use their situation or relationship or whatever to ""bring glory to God."" So in some sense, they are taking control, but in their mind, they are taking control by surrendering control to God, ""holy submission,"" or as the message said, ""having their heart aligned with the Lord's (heart/purpose/plan)."""

This is very true! I've been to enough proms and weddings where gowns were lifted to walk that I thought you meant one need pick up the dress up to walk. Surprisingly (or maybe not so surprisingly) few women know how any more. Bridal and prom shops should offer lessons in these things ðŸ¤”"
