It lamented how they were becoming evermore disconnected, off in a separate billionaire dimention so to speak. I even knew a truck driver that was saving up to retire in Mexico were his meger savings would get him a big house with servants.

I've had a chip on my shoulder  before. But it is probably less durable to an extent, it doesn't flex like steel, every stress damages it somewhat, and seems to burn through faster, but weight and cost are upsides. I worry about plastic bottles sometimes, but I try to act extra manly to counteract the female hormones supposedly coming from it haha."

Oxide dust, but I wonder since titanium is so new to cookware, have there been enough studies about it's health effects? The only downside of using aluminum for cookware would be durability, but that is overcome by weight and cost. Cast iron leaves an unusable form of iron in your liver unless you cook with something acidic like tomatoes by the way, and chrome that makes iron into stainless steel is toxic too."

Civil forfiture and RICO act were part of  the war on drugs that were abused for other purposes later, like doing assessments of property to rank importance for drug raids where people got killed, nothing found, and they still tried to seize the land.

Has talked about attacking American with government directed ""economic warfare"" ignoring it obliviously is like leaving your open wallet on the library table while you go to the bathroom. I think we need a national defence against attacks in some sense. Military budget needs to be scaled back and replaced by militia or natl. guard type training where possible, like infantry ECT. So true that trp is not scaling back spending and bloat and is so not libertarian, but the groundwork that might allow such a system to work inside the country after foriegn influence is limited somewhat, and old boys clubs that hate him are reduced in influence is moving a bit forward. It's making it possible for more people to move up instead of those picked by elites. I'm pretty sure people voted for him because elitists  hate him on both side of the aisle."

It's the system on the fix they've been building since after ww2, they say it's to stabilize the world. Just a coincidence it keeps them Kings of the world and filthy rich lol.
