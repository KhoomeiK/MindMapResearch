Also, your sexual orientation SHOULD be a talking point, which you've made clear Fun fact: I never assumed you were gay, and you assuming I did says a lot more about you than me...

Nest I wasn’t trying to prove it wasn’t a slur, I said it was a slur and that I’d do it again. And lastly I didn’t say what was or wasn’t homophobia’s you came up with that yourself. Finally I do oppose homosexuality, so tough. You’re a homophile. Seeing as it seems like the second messiah is here, maybe head on down to the local parish and tell them about your messiah complex. Update me on how that goes. I’m curious."

Finally, he insulted me before I insulted him. I never pretended to be anything like Christ. I’m just showing up this retarded troll for what he is. He’s called pooprainbow69. Enough said. He’s probably at home laughing at the fact that two people took the bait not one. Also if you are a Mennonite; how the hell do you have a phone?"

Christianity,ffe353t,t1_ffdxwie,1579835471.0,The death penalty is not moral. This has always been the case and  will never change. Christianity is a religion that revolves around redemption. Your claim is bizarre if not even ridiculous.
Christianity,ffdveij,t1_ffdv2va,1579829886.0,"That is why such a thing as the bible or the law exists. That is why judgment exists. Morality does not become a matter of an individual personal taste, but a universal set of rules that must be abided by."
Christianity,ffdv7tt,t1_ffduhit,1579829756.0,"Paul bringing something up in the new testament means it is literally a part of the New Testament. Sure it may have also been mentioned n the old testament, but Paul, who was a new testament figure, is mentioning it: So it is new testament. That's liked saying in the unrevised edition of the law yesterday, murder is a major offense, but in the revised edition, because it was mentioned in the unrevised addition, it cannot be mentoned in the revised edition. Then the law by your own logic would be that murder cannot be mentioned in the revised edition. So murder now becomes permissible?"

Christianity,ffdukit,t1_ffd7t4v,1579829293.0,"Well, then your logic is incredibly faulty. If we apply the logic ""what you do and who you fo it with is none of my business"", then it's up to each individual to come up with their own law, In fact, if I think murdering people, walking around naked, aborting children is ""none of your business"" then the world would be the literal embodiment of hell. If you want to follow a religion than the covenant of marriage is a very specific thing. If you are not a follower of the religion, then of course none of the rules apply to you."

I’m not American and i don’t care about your politics or prime minister but in Aus we are sick of hearing this bullshit. For a prime minister to be sacked for something, it has to be something WRONG. Not some hag on the opposing party wishing she were in his position. Also why don’t you focus on your own life. It’s not like your prime minister even DOES anything. He/she is just a puppet. Nothing in your agenda is ever going to change no matter who you elect. So just focus on yourself. And put some clothes on. You look ridiculous."
