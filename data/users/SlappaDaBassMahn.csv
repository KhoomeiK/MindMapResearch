Scary Terry says it, she says it, so I connected the two. Because honestly in this day and age, a lot more people will connect with a reference to one of the most popular series in the past few years, than a character from movies that were from the 80's to latest 2010, a decade ago. There's adults today who would have been 6 years old when the latest movie came out. And Horror is not a genre that is typically watched by all."

She was 13yo girl in the city she'd dreamt about her whole life. Of course she'd whine when her parent tells her they need to go to the cold North. She doesn't understand the ramifications of staying at that age. 

She didn't tell Jon, because if you watch closely (or at all) you can see him disregarding her at every turn, she believes he has no faith in her and that she is ""just a silly girl"" not a ruler. 

&#x200B;

You make thepoint about the knights of the Vale, so why don't you mention that that's what won the battle. SHE won the battle. Not Jon, regardless of if she told him or not. SHE got the troops and made it happen. When did Catelyn ever do that? 

Sansa helped Jon attempt to recruit the other houses of the North, and she organised the safe housing and feeding of all the people of the North when Winter came. Once again, I point out Catelyn, when she had rule of winterfell, deserted to go on some vengeance mission.
