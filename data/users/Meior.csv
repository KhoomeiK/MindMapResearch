AskReddit,fexunwf,t1_fexcl50,1579436565.0,"Reach one dream, you don't have to reach all, but you should strive for one. 

If a job that you think is okay can fund living where you want and keep you happy, that's good. If you can combine both that's, of course, even better, but hard. 

If you have a dream job and might not be able to live absolutely where you want to, that's also okay. As long as you're happy. 

I used to think that I wanted the best job available and that would be good enough, but I've started to shift. I'd rather live where I want and work an okay job than the opposite. My job should enable the life I want, not the other way around."

You know why a lot of trains are delayed? Because of people playing around on tracks. Ask any train engineer and see what they think. It's lovely being traumatised for life by hitting someone on the tracks. 

Trains are also a lot more silent head on than you might think. The cemetery is full of people who thought they were perfectly able to see and hear a coming train."
