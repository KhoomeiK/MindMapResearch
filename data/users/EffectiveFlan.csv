The ghost pepper pineapple from them is one of my favorite hot sauces.

Also if you're going to order from them, get the aces and eights salsa. Mix a third of the jar with two avocados and you have an awesome dip."

nfl,fe0codg,t1_fe0c6eg,1578809955.0,I'm lost too. I'm really sure what he's talking about anymore. Maybe he's drunk because he's trying to forget the fact that his team is coached by Gase.

It'd be a lot better if people just posted their top 3s for each category or we create a thread like other city subreddits do where you post the best for each given category"
TwinCities,fdh7sa1,t1_fdh7f39,1578417227.0,Not really. There's not much detail to begin with and you're asking specifically for a female. It sounds sketchy and you didn't bother to ask them any questions?
TwinCities,fdh79k9,t1_fdgxa95,1578416907.0,If it's for your friend then you could explain to use the exact reason why it needs to be a female.

leagueoflegends,fchffqk,t1_fch912c,1577649939.0,"S1/S2 were close. If we're looking at all regions, which we are. But honestly S3-S7 is the east. Then after that EU caught up to them."
leagueoflegends,fcg6yb4,t1_fcesl5w,1577637009.0,"I'm not saying it wasn't just this season EU was better. OP claimed EU has always been better than NA.

nfl,fc20sya,t1_fc20lby,1577335999.0,"It's not a well formulated argument. You're the only person calling it a well formulated argument, that's the equivalent of patting yourself on the back. You're literally reaching for any ounce of an argument you can make. I edited my post because I missed some things, it wasn't intentional and I don't understand what difference it would have made.

We lost the game because we played like shit. Instead of moving on, Packers fans are bringing up the fact that we're ""celebrating Rodgers being hurt"" a year ago. Get over it and don't spread false information that we're proud of it.

Also I didn't say that I won. Your deleted comment is you literally giving up because you had nothing else to say except that your argument was ""well formulated""."
nfl,fc1zyzd,t1_fc1zw1r,1577335146.0,"Wow you give up easy, maybe it's because you have no argument.

Good effort though."
nfl,fc1zng4,t1_fc1z8y4,1577334827.0,"This is a fucking stretch lol. Interpret it whatever way you want to make your weak argument stronger and make us look bad. It's definitely not meant to be interpreted it in that way though. These aren't even close to special moments in our history. The death of Prince? No. But sure, keep pointing fingers and say we're the toxic fan base. You should go to /r/minnesotavikings and see how active Packers fans have been there recently.

Also didn't call you stupid, just keep playing the victim bud"
nfl,fc1vj61,t1_fc1uwtc,1577331039.0,"They're calling us a miserable bunch because another Packers fan posted something that was false. If you illiterate fans read it again, the article has nothing to do with history of the city of Minneapolis. It's a generic ad that is unfortunately showing the most recent front pages.

If only Redditors spent time reading sources instead of pulling out their pitch forks."
nfl,fc1tohc,t1_fbxf1cy,1577329382.0,Too bad it's just an ad.
Minneapolis,fc0y968,t1_fc0wvui,1577302936.0,"You find places everywhere to eat without breaking the bank.

90k here is pretty solid especially for entry level. If you're comparing numbers on levels fyi is that for Minneapolis or everywhere? Levels fyi is showing like 75k for Target entry. Amazon and Microsoft are a lot higher. According to NerdWallets COL adjustment calculator, 90k here is equivalent to 216k in NYC."
