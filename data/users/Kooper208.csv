nanaimo,fepyuj2,t1_fepxulp,1579334914.0,"It's fantastic fun, but it can be dangerous and expensive (like a lot of outdoor hobbies or life in general) but it's a hell of a lot of fun. Even a basic 4*4 will get you a lot of neat and fun places with a view. I'd recommend looking into a jeep wrangler of any generation, a Toyota 4runner or a late 90s or early 00s Jeep Cherokee. Solid axles are better offroad and easier to work on but ind√©pendant suspension is more comfortable for daily drive. Biggest and most noticable upgrade you can do is a set of good tires. Wrangler duratracs and Firestone mt2s are both really good tires and you'll notice a huuuuuuuuge difference over highway tires. A Jeep Cherokee or wrangler with good tires will get you places you'd never think with a bit of skill and practice. Don't get sucked into huge lifts and huge tires, it creates a lot of problems and having more than you need doesn't help you. 33"" tires are pretty standard now for offroad use, they're big enough that you can air them down a bit and get over obstacles fairly well but not so big that they're heavy (harder on your steering components) or super expensive. 35s are also very common now but a 35"" tire will be 10-20 pounds heavier per tire which ads up fast and are much more expensive. Also make sure you get LT tires not P tires. Thicker sidewalls."
nanaimo,fepxl5o,t3_eqc8vf,1579334140.0,Kraft fair downtown is a decent place to meet people if you sit at the bar and enjoy beer and cider. Same as wolf brewing on a Friday.
