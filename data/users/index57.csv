factorio,fdqdf6i,t1_fdqa1bk,1578663715.0,"Yes, my point was they are by definition quite resource hungry they add a ton of memory accesses and computation even if optimized. This disqualifies them as main features. The f4 button is a click away."

As to why they aren't default, a lot of them are expensive to run. The extra memory accesses and calculations they require rob performance. They aren't fully optimized either."

But to answer your post, I'm loading it in now, I'll see what's up. Let me know exactly how you want it and I'll set it up for you (I can do anything combinators are capable of)"
