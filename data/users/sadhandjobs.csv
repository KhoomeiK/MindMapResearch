Once, my mom and her cousin spent all day trying to catch a kitten, and were heartbroken when it wasn’t friendly. (They were kids).

Just a memory I had when I read your comment!"

Got an addiction problem but also a health problem? Best leave out that first part if you want to be treated as a human.

You, naturally and normally, want companionship. She provides that, but her companionship comes with so, so much nonsense that at this stage in the relationship and at y’all’s age just isn’t worth it. 

It’ll take some time (a month at most) to disentangle your emotions from her, but I’ll bet you’re gonna get out there and start having fun and meeting self-sufficient and confident women in no time at all. 

Just make it a clean break! Good luck, mate!"
