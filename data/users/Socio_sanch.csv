spicy,felmmu2,t1_feleww1,1579225812.0,"Shamefully, 3 times.

1. I was at this restaurant and had a bowl of pho. The waitress gave me a plate of vegetables including fresh jalapeño slices. And I mean these babies were FRESH. I tossed in a few of them, ate the first slice...and said ""nope. Too much, can't do it. Then literally fished them all back out, and ate in shame. I guess at the moment I wasn't really in the mood.

2. I went to this burger place in downtown St. Pete with my dad and had this spicy AF burger. It cane with this homemade habenero paste. I only ate half of it before I gave in. In hindsight it was for the best, because right afterwards my stomach was in knots. I had to find a grocery store nearby just to use the restroom, lol.

3. I had 10 of these wings from this chicken fast food place and picked the hottest sauce they had. I ate only 7 then debated for a moment. Then I realized I was getting full after like getting 2 refills as it was, and thought maybe I should just call it in. So once again I shamefully said ""I'm done"", and admitted defeat. 

But would I ever do it again? You bet your ass I would."
