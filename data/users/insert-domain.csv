Don't you agree the people in this situation deserve respect?  In third sex cultures these people are considered rare and are afforded certain rights like the spiritual naming of children.  Having the perspective of both male and female insight is valuable and a curse or a gift depending on how you feel about it as the person dealing wit the repercussions and outcomes."
banned,ffczftl,t1_ffcdcuc,1579810420.0,"that is mighty confusing, to me.

are the TRA mostly trans people or mostly straight typical males?"
banned,ffcaho8,t1_ffc9s3m,1579795222.0,"normal or typical cause what is normal really?  idk.  I have observe that most trans folks are gay for the same sex that they are trans in.  Like a female to male trans is gay for men or a male to female trans is gay for women, its just my personal observation of people i have met or observed.
edit but like, in my experience or observation, the other party must identify as gay, not straight.  As a trans person the person identifies as gay in that same gender so therefor wants the gay dating pool to find a partner.

shower thought: if there is not a gay bar called ""dating pool"" there should be, w pool tables, naturally."

SO let me understand, are Trans Rights Activists the men?  And a TERF is a female who thinks trans activism and trans women are ruining the world?
and also men who think that trans activism is weird (I live with one, he also happens to wear womens clothes and wigs and feels like some times he is a woman in a mans body and other times he is a man with a woman inside his body)  This guy gets hate from TERFs even though he basically can define feminism as he is the living definition of it.

I first had to learn what a TERF was.
Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist 
short for bigots against the third sex.
TERFs are also straight bitches 
They are the MGTOW incels of the lesbian world and their targets are intersexed or trans  or crossdressing men.  I would actually fight one if they personally picked on my bestie (intersexed male/female)"
banned,ffc7czb,t1_ff9a1j2,1579793229.0,"My best friend is intersexed meaning he has a girl body hips etc but also a dick.  So he enjoys crossdressing and wearing wigs and he looks like a real woman its amazing, total spot on fashion sense.  She enjoys woodworking and building on cars, in heels and a skirt.  He does not want to take hormones or get a n operation or implants.  He/She just exist as two sexes in one body with both preferring the company of females and both trying to figure out a society that just doesn't have a third sex mentality like other cultures do.  Some men are wives, that is a native American cultural knowledge.  So I guess that's all I know about that.

Intersexed people deserve their own bathrooms.  My friend doesn't want to use the mens restrooms but he understands that he is gender male physically and so he basically just waits and pees at home."

But I am female have not been submissive to men, and have had every wacky hair color and i agree that the term feminazi can be descriptive of some really pushy ladies who are usually vegan and prefer a limited male environment.  I knew of a co-op home that only allowed women and never any men on the property so as to be a zero man space.  I would consider those feminazi irregardless of their haircolor.  

But yeah, just say ultra feminist instead next time since feminazi is kind of a slur on women nowadays due to it being used to abuse some females who are simply taking a righteous stand.

Chronic Traumatic Encephelopathy CTE is known in football players and because of the Will Smith film Concussion (bit of a snooze for some but I loved it)  But this movie told the story of an abused and neglected kid who ended up with a laundry list of disability as well as a brain injury.

When I was younger, a man lit a city bus on fire due to the cutbacks in city funding for his medication program.

The driver was fused to the seat because he had problems getting his seatbelt off in time.  The two people he doused with gasoline and lit afire ended up getting married as they were now both 90% burned up.... one big scar.

A girl I knew whose father was 32nd level 'social organization' ended up with borderline personality disorder so I spent a summer trying to get her help.  Her parents were Satanists.  All we got were disconnected phone numbers and dead end referrals.  After prostituting for a bit, she is now in Dade co jail, again.  To be fair, borderline personality disorder has no cure but she at least deserves a chance at pharmacological care.

Dept of Health and Human Services
Social Security local office
Salvation Army (they are usually accessed through social workers.)
You can contact the social worker of the facility that handled your mother's passing (hospital?)   Someone should have offered you social services, but you could start by asking 2-1-1 how to contact a social worker.

My mother passed four years ago, people are generally very helpful and understanding it's just a matter of asking for help.  I'm so sorry that you have to deal with the coroner and death certificate thing.  Maybe a social worker could also help you navigate that process as well.
