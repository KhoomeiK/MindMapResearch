I don’t recommend my “hundred frogs” method* but there are some good things to say about it, namely it keeps you from throwing all your eggs into an unknown basket (to mangle a metaphor).  

I do recommend you do a lot of talking about “different kinds of people” and figure which kind you are, in many dimensions. 

What kind of music do you like?  Do you like to play, listen, dance to, avoid?

How would you prefer to spend an extra $1000?  Games? Investment? Travel? Gifts? Cooking lessons? Therapy? New bike? (Keep in mind there are no right and wrong answers. If necessary, fill out both sides of: “I know I should X, but what would make me happiest in the near term is Y”)

What activities would be fun to do on a Sunday afternoon with someone you might like to get to know better?  Walk?  Jigsaw puzzle? Boat ride? Baseball game? Feed the ducks? Put together an IKEA bookshelf? Play cards? Museum? Art class? Shopping? Cooking?

Do you like bold colors, pastels, black? Patterns, solids, artwork? 

How do your beliefs today compare to the religion you were brought up in?  Do you think there are many right answers or one right and the rest wrong?  How do you think the world’s major problems today should be solved?  What might be your role in working toward a better tomorrow?  

I believe that in seeking answers to these and other questions you will find others who value the same things you value, and one may become special to you. That’s a good way to do it.

When I was pregnant and wanted to take a supplement etc. it would say to ask your doctor. My doctors told me all they know is what I know, and if it hadn’t been proven safe for pregnant women*, it hadn’t been proven safe for pregnant women. So the answer was always “no”.

*note: nothing has ever been proven safe for pregnant women because can you imagine the tests? “Let’s give this to 1000 pregnant women and see how many babies die or are sickened by it!” Not gonna happen. 

Bottom line:some stuff is assumed safe because pregnant women have been taking it forever and no consequence have been proven. For other things, pregnant women are only given it if the trade off is more risk:  insulin for diabetics, probably heart meds etc.

When I was pregnant and wanted to take a supplement etc. it would say to ask your doctor. My doctors told me all they know is what I know, and if it hadnâ€™t been proven safe for pregnant women*, it hadnâ€™t been proven safe for pregnant women. So the answer was always â€œnoâ€.

*note: nothing has ever been proven safe for pregnant women because can you imagine the tests? â€œLetâ€™s give this to 1000 pregnant women and see how many babies die or are sickened by it!â€ Not gonna happen. 

Bottom line:some stuff is assumed safe because pregnant women have been taking it forever and no consequence have been proven. For other things, pregnant women are only given it if the trade off is more risk:  insulin for diabetics, probably heart meds etc.
