You shouldn't have gone down from 60 in the first place. I don't know what babysitting is generally worth (tbh, watching three young kids sounds like it should be worth *at least* that much), but it literally doesn't matter. They're not paying you to run a daycare; they're paying for you not to do your regular job. If that were lawyer work billed at $300, they'd be hiring a $300 babysitter.

(Also this might be a secondary point, but I'm gonna point it out: the story started making a lot more sense after I got to the ""24-year-old girl"" part. There's no way in hell they'd be trying to stick you with daycare work or low-balling your time if you were a dude. You don't need to take that shit, even from extended family.)"
