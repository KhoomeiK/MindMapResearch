Streaming is interesting since it is serving the purpose of radio and album sales for many people. Like any other product, music's worth isn't going to be driven by cost or effort, but by what people are willing to spend.

Lots of people would love it if their favorite artists, especially less popular ones, got more for their work. It's a shame there isn't an easy to way to send them tips whenever we're moved by one of their songs. It likely wouldn't generate enough to matter to Kanye, but it might matter to local artists.

With universal healthcare, there is one policy offered by one carrier. If you feel the costs are too high or the coverage insufficient, you have no option except to perhaps find secondary insurance to cover what universal will not... and pay for them both.

TwoXChromosomes,ff4x9zi,t1_ff4d7v5,1579574656.0,"As long as money changes hands, some people will find a way to line their pockets from it. Medical care costs money: doctors, nurses and support staff need salaries and new equipment and supplies need to be purchased, but nobody knows what it should cost. Insurance companies try to watch costs, and deny coverage when less costly and equally effective treatment is available, but this does little to reduce cost. It just passes the extra cost on to the patient who did not know the procedure was not covered or that other options were available. 

We need to reduce the cost of healthcare and increase the number of medical practitioners to reduce cost, but our government seems hell-bent on adding more regulation and oversight which reduces the supply, adds cost, and frustrates consumers."
