bipolar,ff7ugcz,t3_erzt9q,1579658639.0,"Personally I have a puppy that forces me to get up out of bed to take care of him. Before him I would just try to do one thing a day and take it slow. Like shower one day, clean one part of my house/room the other. Stuff like that. I know it’s hard to push yourself to get out of bed at all but If you do one thing you’ll feel accomplished and it will make you feel better overall."
bipolar,ff7toe8,t3_es2vi8,1579658104.0,"The first sign I’m manic is I feel like I have a constant adrenaline rush. It makes it hard to sleep because my heart is constantly pounding so I just don’t sleep. Another sign is that I just randomly start wanting to clean my house, which usually I don’t have the motivation for. I also see bugs crawling on the walls that aren’t there. 

Usually the sudden adrenaline rush is a good sign an episode is coming and I need to pay a visit to the psychiatrist"

AskReddit,fck0o9j,t3_ehg5ac,1577712908.0,"I was talking to this guy (to possibly date) for a few weeks but he kept saying and doing things that made me feel uneasy. I had already been through an abusive relationship once so I dodged all of his texts and eventually blocked him. Later on, maybe a few weeks, I saw it all over my friend’s social media’s that he was charged with rape and kidnapping. 
Never felt better about my gut instinct as I did in that moment."
