nba,few6zko,t1_fevsvwq,1579406204.0,"Glad you're feeling better, and also thank you for giving us our first win of any significance in years not having to have a celebratory video dropped in our faces."
nba,feuyg0b,t1_feurrai,1579391172.0,I'll call it what it is... yes we are salty. RJ still being 2nd in ROY odds CURRENTLY every time I check is another reminder of what a joke we are and continue to be.
aww,feepsa7,t1_feeidvo,1579038654.0,"Thank you, bless you too"

aww,fedtbws,t1_fedsgdl,1579019452.0,Yes I've chosen to abandon it for now. The juice might not be worth the squeeze in this situation.
aww,fedt9cc,t1_fedsp0n,1579019407.0,"Mine did too, so thankful."
aww,fedt745,t1_fedqys6,1579019371.0,"Agreed about the 23andme part being shady at best, I'd like to avoid companies like that as much as possible"
aww,fedt04t,t1_fedrioy,1579019253.0,Blessings to you too!
aww,fedq7g3,t1_fedprng,1579017512.0,"They didn't, but I would have laughed. I'm pretty sure I got dropped off by a stork."
aww,fedph5m,t1_fedpceg,1579017059.0,In a lot of situations this is sadly very true.

aww,fedp6zm,t1_fednj8u,1579016881.0,"I never think about it until the word adoption is said honestly, and then it's only to think about how lucky I am."
aww,fedp4ml,t1_fednda5,1579016840.0,"Every good parent probably starts off feeling that same way: I know I'll be panic stricken about messing my first kid's life up and I hope that helps me be the best parent I can be. Fear is ok, allowing it to manifest as anxiety probably isn't healthy."
aww,fedmpu7,t1_fedm50h,1579015292.0,"Agreed. I know it wasn't cheap and I recently looked into at least finding information out about my Birth Parents. I've never wanted to meet them for any purpose other than to say Thank You, and as I'm getting older I've become increasingly curious about significant medical history moments to either prepare for or avoid certain things. The adoption agency wanted $500 to even initiate a search. While I could have spent that, I left frustrated because it seemed unfair. I understand it's a complicated thing, but to even send a message saying ""Hey would you like to briefly meet your biological son, or at least provide him an update?"" shouldn't exhaust too much of the agencies time/resources.    
     
I don't REALLY wanna go down the rabbit hole that is discourse on adoption, I'm just happy it worked out for me and hope people consider it who are in the financial/emotional/personal/life position to do so."
aww,fedm9b8,t1_fedlrhv,1579014987.0,"The narrative is often about adopted kids or step-kids angrily using the phrase ""You're not my real parents (insert Mom or Dad for step children).""    
    
I've never used that phrase but I'm certain I've provided several face-palming moments my parents won't admit to where they at least thought ""He's not our real child."" They'll never tell though."
aww,fedi6ak,t3_eokyfc,1579012150.0,"For those of you who have been told the same thing that their doctor told them but still can't have kids, please consider adoption. I was adopted and have never looked at my parents as anything other than my parents, and they told me from a young age that I was adopted, never hiding it. Trust me when I say you don't have to be a biological child to disappoint your parents immensely. Sarcasm aside, congrats /u/mutantpanda02"

sportsbook,fa95xi3,t3_e8089i,1575863279.0,Timberwolves +6.5 first half... Lebron James out with 4 fouls. Lakers go on 9-0 run in final 1:35 to win first half by 8. Between this and the Bulls over... I dunno fam I dunno.
