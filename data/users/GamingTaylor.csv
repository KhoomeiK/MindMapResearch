I bet you anything that guy spends at least $5 a day on food, probably closer to $10.

If he skipped a meal or ate frugally for a day or two he would have $10"

personalfinance,ff47aa0,t3_erfd25,1579557095.0,"1. How important is the money?
2. Are you respected by co-workers?
3. Are you respected by customers?
4. Is your job fulfilling?
5. Will you be happier if you quit?
6. Will a raise or promotion change your mind?

Number 2 and 6 go together. If you are respected, than before you quit you can ask for a raise, if you are intimidated, than just leave your notice and a raise, promotion, or change in scheadule will be offered. Respected people are not easily lost in the workplace, it costs a fortune of time, money, and emotion to train someone new."

AskReddit,fe44tv9,t3_ennslu,1578855778.0,"When you start working you should start quantifying every purchase based on hours and not how much money you have.

Example: you made $12/hour.  You want to buy something, perhaps fast food.  That fast food may cost $6, that's 30minutes worth of work which is 30minutes of your life wasted to pay for a meal.

Perhaps it's worth it, but by doing this you will be better off financially.  Most people get their two week paycheck, and think ""wow I have $500, I'm going to buy a $24 meal and think nothing of it""  yet they don't realize that's two hours of work.

Do this for everything you buy, and every bill you pay. You will soon realize that a lot of things are not worth while."
Steam,fdzy8nt,t1_fdzu8d7,1578798725.0,"Do you think he actually paid $0.03 per card?

There's ways to get them far cheaper...  I myself paid ~$1.50 (1tf2 key/3rd party) for every 100 event cards (12.4 sets)  
Do the math on say 1000 sets and it would cost $120  
and guess what? The bots that sell these sets get the sets for far cheaper...



I also have a lot of games, but you would be a fool to think I paid for them."

depression,fdds2di,t3_ekqsl7,1578322509.0,"Took me until I was 25 to find someone special. Trust me it's better to wait to find someone who truly wants to be with you long term.

Generally in highschool and college, people just jump around as everything is temporary and unknown. Afterwards people settle down a bit and know more about what they want in life.

Also.. Generally girls like older men who are more mature, you are still very young and likely just need to wait a bit longer."
gadgets,fddozt7,t1_fddc6cr,1578320017.0,"4k gaming isn't even worth it.

Honestly it's better to stick with 1440p and instead go with 144hz to increase your framerate from 60fps to 144. You won't always reach that high, but with first person games, 100+ fps makes a huge difference, especially with a mouse."
personalfinance,fda27ia,t3_ek7fza,1578240803.0,"You would be making a huge mistake by not investing the entirely of your fortune, and then going to a community College and maybe work part time.

You need to realize that $500k sitting in a bank account at 2% interest is $10k profit a year. (that's $10k on top of whatever else you choose to do in life)

This money could also give you the opportunity to buy property that you could lease out while having no bills to pay. In my area you could buy a nice house for about $380, 000, lease it out for 2300 a month, and collect a salary of $27000 a year. House prices will continue to rise in a growing town, so you would likely be able to sell the house later on for a profit.


Obviously you are planning on wasting everything for college, but remember this... A fool and his money are soon parted."
AskReddit,fcn5uan,t1_fcmff6x,1577804057.0,"No, steam doesn't count games that are new or don't meat a threshold to show up on the count. This is to combat developers releasing too much 50cent shovel ware that were being bought up by collectors.

They also don't count games that were removed from the steam store.

So there's a large amount of games in my library that are awful or removed that just don't show up."
