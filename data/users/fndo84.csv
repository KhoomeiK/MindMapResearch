In their vision, male behaviour shouldn't be analyzed in function of its causes. This same media outlets tend to look at female issues as ""social"" and male issues as individual (not valid as social issues only valid as individual issues)."

But to be fair, there is no perfect country, and most Americans I've known are awesome people."
