Damnthatsinteresting,ff3ar0c,t1_ff2doct,1579537547.0,"There is definitely positives and negatives to having a twin growing up. We moved around a lot so it was always comforting to start a new school because I had her there with me. Also, making friends was always easy because the twin thing is a great ice breaker. Negatives would be things like people always comparing us and sharing EVERYTHING. We also have some weird twin stories that some people believe and some don't.  My sister and I are polar opposites but I love everything about being a twin and I consider myself very lucky to have by my side on this roller coaster called life."
