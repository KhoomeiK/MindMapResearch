depression,fe3fsmf,t3_enq0u5,1578848873.0,It's easy to offer sympathy. It's much harder to follow through.
depression,fe0ayz5,t3_enjhpq,1578808218.0,"It would be worse to be sad/down/depressed. I say this because feeling numb allows you to function in a practical manner. When I feel any emotion in option A, I am crippled and find it hard to be productive."
depression,fe0ausg,t3_enjo3t,1578808107.0,Have you talked to your psychiatrist about this? It is dangerous to change your regimen without their approval. It's concerning you are getting these new side effects all of a sudden. I'd talk to your doctor's office and see what they think.
depression,fe0apcb,t3_enjjse,1578807965.0,"Depression is not really a feeling, it is a state of mind. I cannot willfully get out of it. It consumes me and affects every aspect of my life."
depression,fe0alic,t3_enjmi4,1578807865.0,"So you do feel emotions other than sadness? that's the vibe I'm getting from your post. If that's the case, that's good. Sadness is a prevalent emotion, and not ever feeling it is not normal. It gives you a chance to reflect on different events and some alone time."
depression,fe0afsd,t3_enjhxd,1578807716.0,"He sounds like a narcissistic asshole, to be frank. He manipulated you and hurt you numerous times. I get you love him, but it's okay to love someone and not be in a romantic relationship with them. What are the positives you got with this guy beyond just feeling happy sometimes? Did he lift you up and help you in your life? It sounds like he cares about the attention you gave him, not you. At this point I would set up distance between yourself and him. Give him a chance to mature and learn how to respect you as an individual, and then see if you can possibly be friends again. Your mental health and happiness trumps everything else, and it sounds like he did nothing to help either of those things in a meaningful way."
depression,fe098hs,t3_enfyh1,1578806617.0,"I'm in the same boat. For instance, when I text someone and they don't text back, I assume they are plotting against me, and hate everything about me. The world is a shade of grey, and even my closest friends don't matter to me."
