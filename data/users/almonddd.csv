The only thing is any leotard with sleeves is going to be more expensive, and any leotard with mesh is going to be more expensive, so you will have to look harder if you want something cheaper w any type of sleeves."

BALLET,fefwhri,t3_en24zo,1579067477.0,"I have felt like the worst in my class before, and I never knew what to do.  I would honestly recommend talking to your teacher after class.  Ask them what they think you can do to improve so you can get en pointe sooner, level up, etc. If, by ""dance intensives,"" you mean an advanced intensive you have to audition for, then it's not going to be much fun anyway if you aren't able to do pointe yet. I'm not sure if you've considered this or if it's possible for you, but is there any part time jobs you could do to possibly meet your parents halfway and show them you really want to do this?"

depression,fdfmrc1,t3_el3fei,1578365295.0,"I've had this ""problem"" too, and I also don't really know if there's a ""solution"" to it, except to just let it all out.  Sometimes I'll just be in my room, totally fine, with nothing majorly wrong with my life, and then I'll just completely break down sobbing..."

depression,fc7wt22,t3_egn60p,1577520712.0,"If it helps at all, I just want you to know I read the whole thing.  You have been through a lot and you are a very strong person.  I think some type of therapy would be best for you at this point, as you are going to need some help, which is normal.  Try to plan more visits and time with your family as it seems you'd like to get closer with them.  Dogs passing is always sad, so you are not alone with that.  I really don't think you should kill yourself because you seem like a really good person, who is just trying to find their purpose again, and you will find it."
depression,fc7ucpq,t3_egnc7e,1577518860.0,"To me, right now you just need to get some rest even if you can't sleep.  Get comfortable and at least do something relaxing like watching a TV show.  You should at least feel a little better after that.  Lack of sleep isn't good for anyone."
depression,fc7qe2q,t3_eghw5v,1577515980.0,"I think him going to a therapist is a good idea, and possibly you too.  Maybe try to find something simple to do together that makes you both happy, like cooking or art, for example."

Nia went on her own with a different manager, so Abby was very unsupportive of the whole thing."
