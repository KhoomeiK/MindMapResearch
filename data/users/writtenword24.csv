BipolarReddit,febxysz,t3_eo9wlt,1578964090.0,I work as a barista at a mom and pop coffee house. It's not high speed and chaotic like chain cafes - I've only been there a couple months and know many of the people who stop by and find the coffee making to be creative and therapeutic. There's really no stress and it's the most enjoyable job I've had in a while - and the tips are nice too :)
bipolar,fdgw3sj,t3_elbjna,1578409781.0,"I don't have any friends either. I've found it difficult after my first bout in college. I always thought it was them - I think it was easy to blame others because I didn't realize/understand that I had bipolar. It really, really sucks so I understand where you're coming from."
bipolar,fd2reu5,t3_ejodcs,1578150884.0,"Before my diagnosis, I was sober for around 10 months. I noticed something was off about me when I drank - afterwards my moods were all over the place and I was generally unstable. So I quit drinking and my extremes mellowed out.

Last Spring, I thought I'd try drinking again. Ended up going on a bender in September and experiencing such crazy mood swings afterward, it prompted a trip to the doc where I later was diagnosed. I have been sober for almost 4 months now and I've been relatively more stable.

Alcohol and bipolar just don't mesh."
bipolar,fcoslxc,t3_ei9fpc,1577840433.0,Congrats - I quit alcohol (didn't do drugs) and got my diagnosis too! 2020 is gonna be amazing!
bipolar,fclu802,t3_ehs2px,1577756581.0,"You've already got some great advice here. I would suggest talking with your advisor - I don't know if you work with your school's disability services but they might be able to help you in the future. 

I have gone from dean's list to straight F's. It's so frustrating, I feel your pain. My goal is to just take advantage of every resource available to me."
DecorAdvice,fck6ftl,t1_fcio05y,1577717912.0,I like that idea. I really cant see a whole standard mirror in there because I think it would look like a funhouse.
DecorAdvice,fcifuoy,t1_fcgwe8f,1577661900.0,I might give it a try - I'll maybe look into some fun mirrors!
DecorAdvice,fcgkjhs,t1_fcghkao,1577641122.0,Thanks! It's just very plain right now - we plan on updating the vanity because up close you can tell it's falling apart. I might try the hexagon mirrors or do something fun. It's an 1870s house so I'm trying to mix old and new a bit.
DecorAdvice,fcgcdyf,t3_eh86fc,1577638576.0,"We are replacing the vanity. I can't put a mirror there because it's too slanted - the mirror would basically be pointing straight down. 

I'm open to anything - hexagon sticky mirrors? Wallpaper? Tapestry? Just leave it? It's the most boring bathroom in existence- please help!"
BipolarReddit,fc4b0nu,t1_fc2t0ks,1577411493.0,"I've said it before on this sub. I failed out of college 3 times with undiagnosed bipolar. I'm 26, will be 27 when I graduate. I'm sometimes pretty bummed- but I'm going to graduate. It's gonna happen. It's just taking me more time - so if it's something you really want, you'll get there. 

Also, when in college there's lots of great resources available for us, which I never even knew about until my diagnosis. So there's hope and help when you're ready."
