The fallout will sicken and kill millions of people and leave the area unusable. And don't think nukes are pointed only at cities. They will get farm land.

pcgaming,fdo79oj,t3_emecen,1578600120.0,While insane this would push users to Xbox. Microsoft can basically use all of steam's game to sell the new Xbox. Most likely on a reduced game list and a cut still going to Valve/Microsoft/Dev. If this is true Microsoft may just being making Xbox into a brand of pre built pc. Console sales and game sales do not make up a ton of money to Microsoft as a whole so they are free to be as risky as they please.
