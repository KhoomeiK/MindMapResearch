Now explain to me how a large metal casket ferrying around 50+ people with four wheels carrying a shit ton of cash on it, just so you can get change back you feel you deserve, is a good thing.

Don't forget the events of Nemesis. Yes, the Romulans were our allies in the Dominion War, but they were an ally of convenience (and an ally who entered the war under false pretenses...imagine the fallout from that, should they find out). Then they fell back into their internal squabbling, lost control of their entire government to Shinzon, who then proceeded to head for Earth to give it a heaping dose of Thalaron radiation. Picard may've understood the more personal stakes involved in all that, but from the Federation's point of view the Romulan Star Empire just proved they can't be trusted to remain stable."
