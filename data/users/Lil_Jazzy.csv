LadiesOfWrestling,ffnzpde,t3_eu7zhv,1580072715.0,Even if it was just a one time deal I would love to see her go one on one with Bayley especially now that Kylie is face and Bayley isn't. Imagine the promos possibilities leading up to the match. Kylie being saccharine sweet and happy but still willing to throw hands even while Bayley is pushing back hard against a live version of her old persona.
BoardKings,ffnz4jg,t3_eu08zz,1580072504.0,Okay allow me to clarify....if another event will come  up wherein untradables can be sent can someone add me? this Album has been live for an inordinately long time and I've not seen anything official on when its closing.

guro,ff83zcb,t3_erykmo,1579665372.0,Love a nice gory death bit of a different  beast when its a character I like. Though I can see her excessive snark leading to the Warden abandoning her or turning a blind eye when a nasty is about to kill her.
