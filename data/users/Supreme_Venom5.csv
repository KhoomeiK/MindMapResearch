sketches,fcxe3rr,t3_ejcnbk,1578060491.0,"A sketch is pencil on paper. It doesnt have to be realistic or even mean anything. People always told me keep at it ans try and find your own style. You know what I say? Forget that. You do art for yourself not others. Do whatever you want. Copy some other art, scribble on a piece of paper or, as you have done, let your mind spill out onto the paper. Good luck in your art expeditions and life as a whole!"
