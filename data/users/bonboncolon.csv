If you guys really want this to work, you need to make some serious decisions and stick to them. GF needs to ditch her ex, he cannot be trusted. Each time she meets him, she comes back in tears, that alone says a lot.  


OP, you're right about the both of you having very different views.  You haven't even gotten a strong foundation on your own relationship yet and you're talking about commitments? You need to get your priorities straightened up, take off the rose tinted glasses, grow up a bit and see what's in front of you."

Granted, they take a lot of patience and understanding, but I feel it's more effective than hitting a child. I dont' have a kid myself, but I usually see the kids not getting the situation and instead thinking it as a game, which can come across as the kid mocking the parent. They just don't get it. Or they're pushing boundaries, testing them - you need to put your foot down and show exactly where those rules and boundaries are.

I can see what your saying, and I can also see why others might resort to spanking but that says to me you've lost complete control of the situation when you feel have to get physical. My parents didn't spank, but I have, and I like to think, a great sense of empathy and understanding because my own called me out on my bullshit when needed and explained the situation to me.

Making a student work 40 hours a week and then call you ""Lazy, ungrateful and a loser"" just shows how completely unreasonable he is. How ridiculous and self-absorbed and just insane. He is a terrible father and a terrible person. Despite his best attempts in holding you down and pulling you back, you have still pulled through and are making something of your life - you are doing awesome. The Air Force? That's so exciting, I'm of proud of you!!

These people belittle and insult you for no other reason other than why does a dog lick it's balls. Because it can. If you want to cut them out, you are not a bad or crazy for doing so. What your father did to you was very cruel and still continues to do to you. I'm going out on a limb and say he tried to live through you?

I greatly encourage in just blocking them. You can leave no message, nothing. You have TRIED your best on your end, but you know nothing you can do or say will change them. They enjoy treating you like shit and I am so sorry for that. You are not ungrateful, you are not lazy, you are not childish. You are right to be angry. He was not a father to you, and your friends might not understand that but you need to do what is best for you.

If you want to leave them a message, I wouldn't leave them anything insulting, or anything sensitive about your life. You can just simply make it, 'I'm blocking you, don't ever contact me again'. I say this because you must think of what they can use against you.

I'm sorry for the long post, but I again encourage you to cut toxic people out of your life. Remember you have every right to be upset and angry and you never deserved to be treated that way. You are hard-worker, you are a fighter, and you will flourish. Good luck to you lovely, and remember you don't owe them a damn thing, regardless whether they are family or not. If anyone mentions about hurting their feelings, don't worry about it, because they sure as shit don't care about yours, and you deserve better than that. You've got this."
