bipolar,fff85x2,t3_etb69f,1579878117.0,"Happy Anniversary of Being!  Try to just do everything you enjoy today and to not worry about anyone else in the world.  Even just taking a day off from reality and staying in bed for hours could be just the sort of time you need to truly relax and appreciate existence a small amount more.  I'm sorry you're not in a good way, and I hope things improve for you."
