cringe,ff22u0z,t1_ff0g2jw,1579492281.0,"For real - this isn't cringe, it's seriously fucked up. 

This is the shit I grew up with and everyone acted like it was 'normal', 'funny', 'cute', etc. It's not. It's totally fucked and every time I watch these clips from that era, it really hits home just how ingrained in us it was to accept, even desire, this kind of treatment and our 'place' as girls/women in society. And if you didn't go along with it - *you* were the trouble maker. 

I've said this many times, but I am just so incredibly thankful times have changed - for my daughter, for myself and for all girls and women now and going forward. We may still have ground to cover, but watching things like this is a reminder of how far we've come and why it's so important to keep fighting for what's right."

NoStupidQuestions,fem73ga,t1_felrj3d,1579242108.0,"I needed this explanation. I’ve been signing petitions for years and SWORE I voted for it on an actual ballot not long ago and read that it passed in CA - for which I was ecstatic! I loath switching back and forth twice a year for no goddamned reason. But then I saw they weren’t implementing it yet and waiting for the feds.  And that confused the fuck out of me. Since, I was pretty sure it was a state level ballot.


I did not know states don’t have authority to make this change without federal approval.  So that means the couple states I read about that had already stopped participating in DST (regardless of which way they opted) went through the same process and had to have the federal government ‘ok’ it?  Is there an ETA for federal approval?"
cringe,feeq7az,t1_feds0wa,1579038893.0,"What sucks is I remember watching that when it first came out - I was 13/14 at the time and I didn't think of it as rape. That's how fucked up things were in the past. A *lot* of things were considered 'ok' that never should have been. And I'm extremely thankful times have changed and these discussions have/are still taking place and people are being educated.

It literally took me awhile to realize I had actually been inappropriately groped/sexually harassed when the Me Too movement hit. I thought I hadn't because I was never raped. But then I started listening/reading about all the stories and realized I had absolutely had many incidences over the years. It's just that I had grown up in a world where it was either considered 'funny', 'normal' or even 'a compliment'. Which really fucking sucks. Especially, when you tell someone what just happened and you get these responses. I remembered feeling like there was something wrong with *me* for feeling 'weird' when something like that happened - instead of being supported and validated that it's a natural response to not enjoy being groped/harassed by others, especially strangers. And they were in the wrong to touch me without my consent. But at the time we were still being raised with the mentality that our main value was our sexual worth to men in general, regardless of our age or our consent."

I agree with this sentiment personally. However, others feel differently. Whether I understand or agree, some people feel the need to take on these identifiers as part of who they are. That's their choice and as long as they're not harming anyone, I don't have an issue with respecting their choice to self-identify in whatever way makes them comfortable."

AskWomenOver30,fe6sewo,t1_fe6obbb,1578903195.0,"This is what scares the crap out of me. I just turned 49 and I've been on the pill since I was 16. I only was off of it for the year I had my daughter, as it was a planned pregnancy. But then I went right back on when the time came and have been on it ever since. Even during times of no sexual partner, because it's more about all of the benefits - no cramps, regular, non-painful periods (and only every 3 months if I choose), lack of acne, no mood swings, etc. etc. etc.

It was only about a year or two ago that I realized I might have to stop taking the pill once I'm in my 50s and I *seriously* do not want to do that. I'm truly concerned about it and what will happen to my system seeing as I've been on it for, literally, the majority of my life."
relationships,fe5swun,t1_fe56s6n,1578874228.0,"This may be true, but you posted because this is troubling you and throughout this thread you've made it clear that, if this were a closer relationship and you felt better about it, you'd probably be more than happy to make time for it, as you've done with others before.

You've also mentioned many times over that she stopped making an effort to initiate contact and once you stopped initiating, it led to 1.5 years of not seeing each other in person, talking live or over text. And this lack of effort on her part led you to no longer see her as a close friend.

To be clear, I'm not saying there is anything wrong with you feeling that way. But it's clear in your post and responses in the comments that *that* is the real issue, not your lack of time. 

I've seen several suggestions to just be up front and you seem very against doing so. The question is - why? You don't have to be mean and it's not being petty. It's the truth. 

I know you don't understand how she can still view you as a close friend after not talking for 1.5yrs, since you don't view her as a close friend anymore. And you seem perplexed as to why/how she can't understand this without you explicitly saying so. 

But as many people have shared - not everyone views relationships the same way. It's clear your idea of a close friendship is different than her idea. Others have shared their own experiences of losing touch with a close friend for long stretches of time and yet both parties still feeling close. And of course there's plenty of people who are like you and wouldn't see that as a close friendship anymore, regardless of how long a history there had been before that point. Both views are equally valid. There isn't just one right way, it's about what works for the parties involved. And in this case, the two people involved have different views of what a close friendship looks like. That is why she sees it differently than you do and isn't 'taking the hint' when you say you don't have time.

What do you think is the heart of the reason you feel resistant to being straight forward with her and explaining to her what you've been willing to explain here to a bunch of strangers?"

OMG this is so accurate!. Minutes felt like hours. Eons, even. I was absolutely lost and a complete basket case. 

I've come to the conclusion I just can't handle weed. I apparently cannot for the life of me find the right balance between feeling nothing and 'I'm disappearing into a dark, empty abyss where I cease to exist and I'm never coming back, OH MY FUCKING GAWD, PLEASE MAKE IT STOP!'

The last bad trip I had was from eating not even half of an edible gummy square. I was stuck in the above cycle for what *felt* like a goddamned eternity and I was losing my shit hardcore. I literally started praying, begging and pleading to 'please let me stay here, please let me stay here' non-stop every time I came back from wherever it was I was fading off to.  And I'm not even religious. It was terrifying.

All my logic and trying to remind myself - I've been through it before, that I was, in fact, just high as fuck, was *not* blinking out of existence and would eventually sober up - didn't do a damn thing to calm my terror. That particular time it was also accompanied by the most fucked up physical sensation in my legs, so I was  constantly rubbing them up and down trying to make it stop. I was a literal crying, rocking back and forth, bat-shit-crazy mental patient for about 2 hours straight. 

That was the third bad trip and the worst one of all. And probably my last because I'm way too scared to risk it again."

RedditForGrownups,fdopv2h,t1_fdnmqyc,1578610188.0,"I was completely committed to my first LTR - for 14 years. And for probably 10 of those years I constantly felt like I was meant to be with someone else/somewhere else. But I still tried everything to make that relationship work and never strayed.

I left that relationship after it had turned emotionally/mentally abusive for about 2yrs and I realized I would be less miserable alone.

I then started dating my current SO the following year and for the entire time we've been together - 18+ years - I've never once wanted to be anywhere else but with him. Through any issues we faced and way beyond the 'honeymoon' stage, my love and desire for him did not wane. 

I don't know that he was 'the one' I previously felt I was meant to be with. But what I did realize, is that nagging feeling all those years with my previous partner I think was my inner voice telling me I wasn't really happy *with him*. 

So I think maybe it's a bit of both. I think commitment is important, but it's not the only thing. There still has to be some kind of spark/connection to the person that keeps that desire for them present, even during the rougher times or just plain 'boring day to day life' times.  With my current SO, it has always felt so very different and I've always felt like I'm exactly where I'm meant (and *want*) to be."

I always thought that was sad. He was already handsome naturally, but I could understand a bit of plastic surgery, since many people feel more confident with a little tweak here/there.

SeriousConversation,fdmesq9,t3_elx4yi,1578547535.0,"Yes! Or at least something very similar. I have *always* wanted to the power to 'hop' into someone else's body/mind and experience life as them for a day. Like, just to understand what it feels like to literally *be* someone else. What do they think? What does it feel like walking around in their body? What do they pay attention to? What do they think? How do they feel about - well, everything? 

As you say, I can only ever experience life from my own perspective. Even when someone is telling me the most detailed things, I still can only know it through my own filters. Even if we went through the exact same thing - it's still different. They had a different perspective than I did and in so many ways - mentally, physically, emotionally. It's just *different* and there's literally no way to fully immerse yourself in someone else's life experience. But I have always wanted to do exactly that. Even if just for a few minutes. Just enough time to experience, first hand, what it's like to be someone else entirely.

At first, it was the freedom and independence it gave me. I could go anywhere I wanted, just because. I'd often just drive around the city, getting to know different areas and various ways of getting places. Which became valuable as life went on since I was so familiar with my city and surrounding areas. I even knew how to get around nearby cities I liked to visit often - so I'd rarely get lost.  Of course, that was before GPS was a thing for the average person.  I do appreciate being able to go anywhere and always know where I am.

And one of my favorite things to do when I need time to myself is go for a nice scenic drive; sometimes with my music full blast, sometimes with no music, windows down and just enjoying the fresh air and sounds around me. It always seems to do the trick - calms me when I'm anxious/upset and motivates me when I need some inspiration.

My SO and I are on the same page in that we hope there will always be places to drive freely - since it now seems possible that could change drastically within our lifetime. Especially, with how many people there are now who really don't like driving, fear driving or just think it's dangerous and/or bad for the environment. There's a lot more advocating for self-driving vehicles and such. And I do understand some of their points.

I *would* give this up if it was necessary and truly better/safer/more beneficial for society at large, but man would I miss it terribly and feel quite tethered.

lawofattraction,fddezlb,t1_fdcjefq,1578309242.0,"Here are some of the things I do - they may or may not work for you, but thought I'd share. (Man this got way longer than I intended, but I didn't want to delete it now that it's written)

When I first started doing this my goal was to just catch negative thoughts and literally flip them into positive thoughts. Even if it wasn't 'true' at that moment. 

For example, I deal with serious chronic illness and it comes with a lot of unpleasant, life limiting symptoms. Before I started changing my thoughts, if I woke up feeling sick, in pain, etc. I'd unconsciously dwell on those things in my head. I'd think things like -  Holy hell, do I feel awful today, I feel like I'm gonna collapse or I feel so damn weak. Basically, I was mentally narrating what I was physically feeling. Once I decided to change my thoughts and I realized I was doing that, I'd think (or say) the literal opposite of what I felt and replace it with what I *wanted* to be feeling. Things like - I feel fabulous, I feel strong, I have so much energy.


Of course it hasn't cured my illness, but it has *absolutely* made a positive impact on it. Many of my symptoms have improved and become easier for me to work with, I have more 'good' days than before and my not so good days usually aren't as bad. It's just easier for me to manage overall than before I started doing this. 


I also implemented thoughts of self-love. I actually didn't know *what* it meant to love myself. Still working on it, to be honest. So I've been saying to the universe every day/night - I will love myself and take care of myself in healthy, constructive ways. I also will say things like - I love myself, I love my body, I feel confident, I feel safe, etc. Just constantly bombarding my mind with things I *want* to actually feel. I do truly feel better about myself; which motivates me to take better care of myself. 


Lastly, every night as I'm falling asleep, I go through all the things I'm grateful for - in general (so I list many of the same things each night) and for that particular day (so I am acknowledging something positive each day). Sometimes, when I'm having a particularly rough day, it might be something as simple as  - I'm thankful I'm alive. or I'm thankful I am in a warm bed, with a roof over my head. 
Whatever it takes to force yourself to see the good in your life, no matter how seemingly small.

At first, some of these things felt forced and they were. But it doesn't matter - I kept doing it. I also had to consciously 'check in' with myself a lot to catch my negative thoughts. But the minute I realized what I was thinking, I'd flip it around. No matter what was actually happening, I'd change my thoughts to what I wished was happening now and what I wanted my future to be.

After awhile, it felt more natural and easy, almost second nature. And many things became true. My overall, general mindset and outlook on life and myself shifted to a much more positive and constructive place. Things go more smoothly and fall into place more easily; and in my favor more frequently. And when difficult times hit, I find I can handle them better and they have less of a negative impact on me/my life.


Maybe it's because I'm experiencing life from a more positive frame of mind so I see the positives instead of the negatives more often than not. Something I read when I was young that has always stuck with me, and fits: 'You will always find what you look for. If you look for the good, you will find it. If you look for the bad, you will find it.' 

Or maybe it's because I'm making decisions that work better for me because I feel better about myself and my life. Or maybe I'm attracting the things I want because I'm communicating it to the universe via a more positive constant stream of thoughts. I think it's a mix of all the above.


One thing that's important to clarify - you don't want to live in denial or avoidance of the issues in your life. There's value and power in acknowledging what is actually happening and how you truly feel about it all.  Your experiences and feelings are valid and it helps us to process them. You just don't want to get 'stuck' in that negative place permanently and let it become your overall self and world view.

When I go through something difficult, I give myself permission to really feel the emotions, sit with them for a bit, cry, scream, laugh - whatever I need to do. But I also give myself a deadline to wrap it up. Whether it be a day, a week, a month even - depending on what it is, some things need more time than others. But deadline arrives, I force myself to stop, dust myself off and start moving forward again. 

I recently went through something exceptionally challenging and it had a hold of me for a couple months straight. I managed to keep up with some of my affirmations, gratitude and thought flipping - but many days I just couldn't. So I used the new year as my 'hard stop' deadline.  A couple days before I started telling myself - I'm letting go, I'm accepting what has already passed and I'm making peace with it all. Then I started hardcore forcing myself back on track. 

The amazing thing is I could *feel* a genuine shift within myself by the 31st. It's not always easy, but I definitely feel myself falling back into my stride and actually feeling better about myself again and hopeful about my future again.

As a disclaimer, this is just what I've done and what I've found has worked for me. And it's not a replacement for counseling, if needed. In fact, I decided to start therapy last month to help me better work through some things. Which I think falls under self-love/self-care. But I'll continue with my affirmations and thought flipping, as it's now just a part of my day to day life at this point.

Whatever the case - I send you internet (((hugs))) and wish you well in your journey from the darkness into the light. And apologize for the very, very long response - I hope at least something in it is helpful. <3"
lawofattraction,fdd9ljm,t1_fdbi9te,1578301237.0,"I do something kinda similar. I imagine all of my negative energy leaving my body and flowing out into the universe, which then leaves space within me to welcome positive energy. 

Although, I've recently added that the negative energy becomes neutral energy once it's out in the universe. For reasons I don't fully understand, imagining my negative energy remaining negative out there in the universe was bothering me. lol! But adding that 'neutral' caveat has really made the entire process work much better for me.

I think it's somehow tied to my other caveat I always add whenever asking the universe for anything - I ask it to be received in the 'most wonderful, positive ways'."

It's always fascinated me how my brain can even manifest such a dreamworld in the first place, let alone how I can remember so much. I am nowhere near as 'creative' in my waking life - I wish I was!"
RedditForGrownups,fd77d8y,t1_fd5qr5k,1578200388.0,"This is similar to my experience. I'm in my late 40s and had a very atypical home life and a very dysfunctional family. When I was very little - 2y to maybe 5/6yr -  I have a lot of flash memories of moments, all of which are more traumatic/scary, which is probably why they stand out. Then from that point to maybe around 10y, my memories are a bit more fleshed out and include not just traumatic things. And from that point forward, the rest feels like just how my overall memories work; where I can recall many things just because, and other things I can pull forward based on something that triggers it or thinking about where I lived or what was going on in my life/the world, etc. 

As for my fear of abandonment and the plethora of other things in my fun bag of issues - I absolutely *know* where they come from and have many memories of where/when/why from my childhood and teenage years and things I've been working on ever since."
RedditForGrownups,fd750hq,t1_fd5qr0z,1578199514.0,"I think the earliest memory I have is when I was under 2y but I had to have been closer to 1.5+. It was me, falling arse first into the fish pond in our back yard. I mostly recall the cold, wet feeling seeping into my pants/undies and being terrified of the goldfish swimming near me - and then promptly crying. 

The second memory is my dad opening up our front door wearing only his tighty-whities and me standing behind him, holding onto one of his legs, looking outside and everything 'shaking'. Like my visual memory is that everything was shaking like an earthquake.  When I told my mom about this memory, she said it was when the bombs went off in the railroad yard in Roseville. 

I just found a link - https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/history/article145902054.html - it was in 1973, so I was 2yrs old. The crazy part is that the house we lived in at the time was near Florin Rd, which is South Sacramento and many miles from Roseville. It's crazy to think it was felt that far away!!"

When she asks him to warm one up for her,too - his reasoning for *not* doing it is saying it won't 'be as good' as if she makes it herself? Think about it - he won't do something so fucking simple as to get a second Hot Pocket out while he's already getting one for himself; even after she asks him. I honestly don't even know *what* that is. But it seems a lot worse than just being self-centered. That seems intentional."
AdviceAnimals,fcoek6n,t1_fcodjh1,1577830328.0,"It seems like for some people, the idea of being married changes expectations. Even in long term live in relationships, once married, one or both partners somehow think it will be different and it’s usually because they have ‘expectations’ of what marriage should be and often don’t even realize it consciously.
So it’s not even something they can talk about if they don’t realize it.

My dad had that happen. They had been together and living together for several years and almost immediately after they got married his wife changed. They are still together and I’m sure they will stay married until one of them passes. But he spent many years being really unhappy with the changes and having to readjust."

AskWomen,fcckhu5,t1_fccdn5x,1577599442.0,"I'm happy to hear your fiance did stand up for you and offered to not have him in the wedding. It's definitely difficult when you're in a situation where you need people's help - you tend to allow them more leniency than they sometimes deserve (the friend).

I can very much understand how difficult being disabled can be. I'm perm disabled due to MS and my life has also become extremely isolated. Most people take for granted just leaving the house every day and seeing other people in the normal routine of it all - whether it be at work or school or wherever it is they go. Just eliminating that from your life is huge in terms of isolation. But on top of it, when you're too ill or unable to socialize, you also lose touch with friends and family, because you literally just can't go do things like before. So I can very much empathize with your situation. It's a hard life to live and most people will never understand. All we can do is make the best of it and do whatever we can, whenever we can. 

I'm so sorry to hear of your past abuse - no one deserves that. But I'm glad you have found someone who treats you well, knows your value and that you feel loved and safe with."

AskWomen,fcbue27,t1_fcbfnka,1577591081.0,"Holy shit - that is completely messed up and entirely unacceptable! I am so sorry you had to even read such trash from someone.

I'm also sorry your fiance didn't stand up for you, but it's even worse that he's actually having this piece of trash in your wedding?! That's just wrong in my opinion. You deserve so much better! It sounds like you are very isolated, which makes it so much harder to stand up for yourself when shitty people do shitty things, so I understand feeling like you have to put up with it. But you really deserve much better, I hope you know that. (((hugs)))"
facepalm,fcbhjef,t1_fcaonkb,1577586944.0,"I agree with you overall. 

However, I also think there is still a cultural learned behavior at work in some cases. And maybe it happens at the most impressionable period of their growth and it just sets in as 'the way it is' - even when it isn't logical if they would just think about it for longer than two seconds. 

I see this really fucked up thought process in my dad. Who at the same time would be extremely supportive and proud of me in my endeavors growing up and throughout my life - cheering on my dreams and successes and saying what a 'strong, intelligent, capable woman' I am - while still holding the most archaic beliefs and not understanding why I don't agree.

But it wasn't *that* long ago in the U.S. that women couldn't have their own bank account and credit cards. This was actually an issue for my mom when she and my dad divorced in '73. Which completely blows my mind. But it gives me an idea of what life was still like when I was born, let alone what it was like prior to that.

My dad is 84 - born in 1935 - so he has a very old school patriarchal view on life. The fact his mother was a single mom who raised 9 children on her own and ran a gas station she owned should have given him a different perspective, yet it didn't. I think in his mind, it's not that women 'can't' be strong, capable, independent, successful on their own - it's that they aren't 'really happy' in that scenario. He didn't grow up in a traditional patriarchal household because my grandfather died when he was 2. So he saw my grandma was a very independent and capable woman - who was also an immigrant from Italy, I might add. Yet - he has the worst ideas about women's place in the home/society as well as shitty views on immigration, too. 

There are so many contradictions going on inside that man's head, I can't comprehend how he isn't able to see the reality. 

We used to argue about all kinds of things growing up and whenever we'd reach a point where his 'logic' didn't fit and he didn't have a answer, he'd just kinda laugh and look at me, but not say anything more on the topic. I think somewhere in those moments, he was realizing truths, but just couldn't or wouldn't admit it. 

A couple years ago, we got into a heated discussion about women's 'place'. He argued that the hippies and women's lib screwed everyone over by pushing women to work and be independent. That life was better and everyone was happier back when he was growing up. That women should be happy at home, taking care of the house, the family, the man. In turn, the man works and takes care of the family and the women are 'in charge' anyway. So everyone was happy and the world was a better place for it! 

After he went on and on about how women should be 'happy' with that life, I finally asked him - 'So *you* would be happy staying at home, cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, grocery shopping, etc. and not having *your own* job, money and independence and completely relying on your spouse for support?' He answered so fast and adamantly - 'HELL NO!'

I just looked at him in disbelief, but at least he was honest. So then I asked - 'If you wouldn't be happy and want to live that life, why should *I* be happy and want to live that life? Because I don't have a penis and you do?!?'   Couldn't believe I actually said that last part, but it flew out. Funny enough, that didn't phase him at all. And as usual, he didn't really have an answer. He just kinda stopped, laughed and looked at me. 

So I honestly believe that some part of him actually understands how fucked up it is to expect women to somehow 'want' the kind of life he himself admitted he wouldn't be happy with just because they are female. As if, just by that one factor alone, we are somehow different and not the same kind of human with similar wants, needs, dreams, etc. 

But that's what life was like when he was growing up and especially at the most impressionable time for him. Plus, I'm sure it helps that he's on the side that benefits more in that equation. So to him, it was the greatest time ever. And sure, it probably was, for him. But not for everyone and *that's* the part he can't or doesn't want to accept. 

He absolutely seems to agree we are every bit as *capable* as men - it's the part about us actually being 'happy' doing such things that really doesn't click in place for him. And I don't know why. It's like he has little empathy for those who's lives were not so great in those days and within that social structure - mainly women and minorities. In his mind, everybody had their place.  Therefore, everybody was 'happy'. It's like he can somehow understand *he* would not like being in their position, but he can't bridge the gap as to why *they* aren't happy being in that position. It completely blows my mind.

So all of that to say - I think some men, and just people in general, have these disconnects in their head when it comes to certain things. I think it's a learned behavior that comes from either their culture or how they were raised and/or what went on in their own families. And so they have these disconnects about other people and can't quite empathize properly because of it - whether it be based on sex, race, cultures, etc.  Like my dad - he agrees women are smart, capable, etc. but doesn't think they are really 'happy' in those roles and would be much happier living the ideal '50s lifestyle'. Yet, at the same time, he 100% admits *he* wouldn't be happy living that life. So why does he think women should be? He doesn't have an answer. Total fucking disconnect."

relationships,fcavw3t,t1_fc9va93,1577577646.0,"Different person, but is it possible she thinks *you* don't want contact and that's why she doesn't initiate? Your first post said you moved something like 1200 miles away once you turned 18 and only see her every 2 yrs; and that you don't actually enjoy spending time with her when you do visit, because the way she wants to spend time with you doesn't work for you. 

All of which, to be very clear, is totally fine; and I am not saying you should feel guilty or bad or any different than you do. You obviously had valid reasons for why you wanted to move so far away and go low contact. And there's nothing wrong with doing what's best for you and your own mental/emotional well-being.

I'm only asking if it's possible the reason she keeps her distance and doesn't reach out is because you've made it clear you don't really want to talk or spend time with her. If so - she might be leaving the ball in your court and not trying to force a relationship if you don't want one; or is allowing you to dictate how close that relationship is and how frequently you talk to and see her. Maybe in her way, she thinks she doing what you want - keeping the door open, but not trying to force you through it?

It seems this could possibly be the case based on what you've shared in your original post and now, so just something to consider. 

Of course you know your mom best, so it may not ring true at all."
