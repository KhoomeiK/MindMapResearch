xfl,ffjiek3,t3_etx13o,1579998907.0,"I got New York and dc in the East, La and Dallas in the West with Dallas over New York in the championship. Watch out for those wildcats I think they’re a big surprise winning team and I also see Seattle being a big surprise let down team (sorry Seattle fans)."
xfl,ffji4no,t1_fdn0bxf,1579998720.0,I’m thinking about going with dc considering their close to me in Virginia and seem like a fun team with Cardale Jones but I also want to root for an underdog like Tampa. Stuck.

AskRedditAfterDark,ffivaj1,t1_ffi9nh2,1579983574.0,What about the balls? Seems like a lot of women even those who like giving blowjobs don’t care for the ball work. What about you?
AMA,ffitrk4,t1_ffijlp3,1579982514.0,"That sounds fun! Well my advise would be just don’t overthink it. Don’t worry about if you should or shouldn’t do anything like hold her hand, kiss her etc just go with the flow and see how it goes there’s no deadline for firsts. Just see how it goes if it’s been a good day and she’s been close to you all day when a time hits that you’ve been laughing or really hitting it off talking then go for it or even ask I’ve known girls who respect that. Just have fun and know she wouldn’t be going out if she didn’t like you. Good luck!"

xfl,ffid5sy,t1_ffhjjlq,1579971049.0,I think Portland would do great or even Boston I’m not sure why there never are too many football teams there I agree with you but I hate to see a couple teams do bad because if a few teams tank financially it may drag the rest down until it stabilizes. I hope not but with only 8 teams in the league I could see it.
xfl,ffh7yf7,t3_eliyy3,1579925679.0,"Root for an underdog! Los Angeles and Tampa bay are pretty far behind in fan bases and sales so go against the rest of the league and if they end up the best team in the xfl you can be among a small amount. I’m going with one of the two I’m just not for sure myself it’s a tough decision, once I pick a team I’d never bandwagon and I haven’t had to pick a new favorite team in like 2 decades."
xfl,ffh7pr6,t1_fdiiq11,1579925476.0,Los Angeles and Tampa bay need some fans too. Got nfl teams but they are way behind in tickets and fans compared to the rest.

unpopularopinion,ffg7nxl,t3_etgg0s,1579900225.0,The thing is if a few select people downvote something with a good point it makes it until people won’t see that good point because it gets covered up and a few more will downvote when really you may have just been disagreeing and technically have been right or just at a disagreement. If you go to the wrong sub and say something that varies from the primary idea then you get downvoted and nasty comments when you may have just had simply a different opinion and was debating not arguing. Many can’t debate without getting mad and arguing.
Showerthoughts,ffg7755,t3_etgg1g,1579899935.0,Incel means involuntary celibate and celibate means to refrain from sex or marriage which also means to stay a virgin so technically you couldn’t be a incel if you have sex but you could share the same stupid thought process and be just as bad as some of them are.

SweatyPalms,ffeggna,t1_ffe8r3e,1579847056.0,It is horrible and wears one a person. I can remember only one time it was funny and my great grandpa got up from his chair held onto it and walked out the door attempting to walk down the road with his chair still on him like he was just going to walk until he decided to sit again.
avengedsevenfold,ffefsrg,t1_ffecu9u,1579846346.0,"It’s lyrics from dose when he says “here in 54, tastes of napalm fill the sky” and I put the deathbat subtly in the background to see if anyone would find it. You can dislike it but I made it specifically for this sub."
xfl,ffe93gg,t1_ffe8u6u,1579840079.0,That definitely isn’t a good look I’d rather have no logo as another teams tbh. Also never been a fan of the league logo on the field like the panthers do.
