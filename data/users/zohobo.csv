honestly as i found my own identity and came to terms with my sexuality i kind of grew out of it."
dogs,feijaow,t3_ep5jpm,1579139833.0,"it honestly sounds like it’s time. give her lots of kisses and hugs and if you can i recommend taking a paw print with pet safe paint of hers so you have that.

dogs,fe6nph0,t3_enp9ke,1578897287.0,send the dog back to the rescue. tell them it wasn’t a good fit.
dogs,fe6njli,t3_enzc1e,1578897107.0,"small dogs ( 5-15ish lbs) live forever and can be more vocal- they also can’t hold potty as long as much larger breeds. their pocket size advantage is you can stick them in a bag and bring them around with you or set them up at home- they’re basically cats in terms of space.

medium size dogs (20-40ish lbs)need more exercise than people think and a lot of breeds in this weight class are intelligent and will need mental + physical stimulation

large size dogs (50-90ish lbs) it seems like they’ll take up a lot of space- do your research on breeds. some large dogs are potato’s (bulldogs) and some might destroy your apartment without hours of exercise and mental stimulation (huskies, shepard’s, smart dogs who want jobs)

giant size dogs (100+ lbs) Most of these dogs are actually GREAT for apartments if your lease allows it. Mastiffs, Great Danes, etc.

toastme,fc6lzy7,t3_egemup,1577483736.0,"i tried to kill my self last year and people found me and brought me to the hospital.

my life was still absolute garbage until this past month or so. 

i’ve never been more grateful that i didn’t succeed.

it might take a very long time but you owe it to yourself to give 1,000% of yourself into building a life you love.

i lost a lot of friends and had to work horrible difficult hours and go without to get where i am now but it was worth it.

take a chance on yourself. if i can do it you can do it."
