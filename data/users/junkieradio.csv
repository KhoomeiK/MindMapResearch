agedlikemilk,fgjknlw,t1_fgje6zm,1580846009.0,"But I'm not comparing lemonade and drugs.

I'm comparing how mentioning something in a couple songs doesn't signify an extreme link ie. Only drinking lemonade or dying from drug abuse. 

I can have a song talking about how much I like the colour green, doesn't mean I'm only going to wear green clothes or eat green food. 

At no point did I compare lemonade and drugs, work on your reading comprehension."
agedlikemilk,fgj2u2f,t1_fgj18me,1580835922.0,How am I comparing lemonade to drugs? wat.
agedlikemilk,fgiv5l3,t1_fgis049,1580831598.0,"'make music about drug abuse' 

I read that as the main thing they make music about is drug abuse. 

It seems like it would be a pretty pointless observation otherwise, 

ie. Gucci Mane has a song about lemonade therefore you shouldn't be surprised when you find out all he's drank for 20 years is lemonade."
agedlikemilk,fgipthh,t1_fgiopot,1580828154.0,"wat? Look at his lyrics, I don't even get why you're arguing this, it's so insignificant."

Admittedly if you count alcohol that number goes up but it's definitely not the predominant theme in his music."
agedlikemilk,fgimsdf,t1_fgimpp6,1580826016.0,His music wasn't predominantly about drug abuse.
agedlikemilk,fgik04r,t1_fgidqn7,1580823885.0,"It's definitely not trap also a lot of musicians think the term mumble rap is insulting and downplays their style and talent, they're not wrong either."

dataisbeautiful,fg3q6pm,t1_fg3m5ip,1580487292.0,"Let me tell you this-- /r/Drama is one of the most malevolent, cruel, coldhearted online communities you'll ever find, and even as a supporter of free speech it appalls me that Reddit would allow such a vile, festering hub of bigotry and sadism to exist. You think [slur]town was bad? That subreddit, if you pick up on the dog-whistles (and many don't even bother with that-- say want you want about Stormfront, at least it bans ""n[slur]""), will reveal itself to you as Reddit's number one hub for the web's most hardened Nazis, Klansmen, Fascists, and Gamergaters. You'll notice on the sidebar that it encourages members to be as dramatic as possible. That's intentional. They encourage arguments in the comments section. That's intentional. You know the Three Minute Hate (it's from this underrated book 1985, give it a read, it's scary how much it parallels our society)? It's like that, they want to stoke the flames of reactionary rage so they continue to dogpile every progressive and minority who enters the subreddit, normalizing these evil feelings. They brigade from subreddit to subreddit, having an entire cabal of mods spanning hundreds of communities, gaslighting lived experiences of the oppressed and unashamedly bolstering Reddit's homegrown white supremacy movement. They've kink-shamed hundreds of people too, some even... to death. I fear that /r/drama may be producing an entire army of Dylann Roofs and Elliot Rogers, and I highly suggest that nobody dares visit that horrible subreddit, lest you potentially fall victim to its corruptive aura."
