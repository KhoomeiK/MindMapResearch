AskReddit,ffbha40,t3_esi1iu,1579765247.0,"I worked for MCI back in the 90s. This is before they became MCI/Worldcom. They were a telecommunications company who competed with AT&T back before the age of cell phones. Something that they kept under their hat was the fact that they made 2500% profit off of every long distance phone call they serviced. This is how they could undercut AT&T and even after the price wars got rolling- there was so much god damn money it was unbelievable. 

MCI funded the most ridiculous ventures. They put together office buildings of consultants who would contract out for other companies and basically just blow cash for no reason. I was on a team that designed software which was going to run on a $40million super computer. After two years they decided it was a stupid idea and ""Re-Orged"" all of us. Hundreds of millions of dollars completely wasted. 

Video phones was the new thing. They spent so much time advertising the fact that we were going to beat AT&T to video phones that no one in the company stopped to wonder if this was a stupid idea. Both MCI and AT&T were getting film studios to put their prototypes in scifi films. It was idiocy. No one wanted this.

And then Sprint happened. The scrappy little underdog company who everyone looked down on for not trying to compete in the future 'Video Phone' market (and who refused an offer for MCI to buy them out btw) started selling cell phones. Watching a once great megacorporation lose all of it's money was not a pretty sight. The first thing to go was our CEO who got taken out in handcuffs for trying to rig the stock price. After that they started selling off buildings. Followed by massive layoffs and endless mergers. In just ten years, MCI's brand name was sold for $1. But by then the company itself was long gone. 

AT&T survived, just barely. I guess they either had more money to lose or perhaps they picked up cell phones faster. It sure was an experience though. I remember having an MCI 'Text message' pager. I could send a text message page to some by calling an MCI 1800 number and talk to a live person on the other end. I would give them the phone number, tell them the message and they would say ""Okay, I'll send it"". And the whole time I was thinking ""Holy crap, this is like some bladerunner shit. I'm living in the future! Whats next? Video phones? Oh my god!"""

That is not how it works. US Presidents don't sit around a maproom at Joint Base Andrews playing the military like an RTS. Do you really think Trump even knew who Solemini was before that happened? Did you? The US military is split up between a variety of regional ""Commandes"". United States Central Command (USCENTCOM), United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), United States European Command (USEUCOM), United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM), United States Pacific Command (USPACOM), United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM), United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM). These commands operate independent of each other and largely independent of the president. Each of them can take action in their sphere of influence so long as they follow current standing orders. Which (after 9/11) involve extrajudicial killing. This is why the military bombs yemen with out having to talk to anyone. This is why Osama Bin Laden was attacked and killed inside Pakistan with out having to get written permission from Obama first.

There are, however, limitations to this power, few as they may be. For example, they are not permitted to attack anything inside the borders of Iran (which is why they chose Solemini since he was in Iraq at the time) however they have no problem agitating for a larger conflict because even though they can't attack anything in Iran, they can certainly build bases all along the border of Iran and fly transport planes along the edge all day and night hoping that Iran does something. This idea that Trump is some how calling up individual officers on the ground and saying ""Hey, I have a very special mission for you"" is just ridiculous. In 2016 alone, the military under Obama dropped 26,171 bombs. Do you think Obama made 26k phone calls? Do you think he signed 26k orders? Do you think he even visited the pentagon more than once?

AskTrumpSupporters,fe0hcw3,t1_fdundjp,1578813453.0,"In the late 1980s, the Global Warming hysteria died down significantly. After the wall street crash it seemed that priorities had begun to shift and many people in the environmental movement scattered to other movements. It could have just been my imagination- but this is how it appeared to me at that time. I began attending college and eventually grad school and it came as something of a culture shock. Appeal to majority and appeal to authority seemed to have little to no value in this new environment. Astronomy, Medicine, Physics, Robotics, Computer Science, Chemistry, Microbiology. I was surprised to find no trace of Climatology. In addition to this, the sciences which should have overlapped Climatology- sciences such as Geology, Archaeology (I'm just adding archaeology, not going to claim it is a science), Particle Physics and Astronomy did not lend any credibility to the narrative I had become so familiar with. At times they even contradicted it.

The years went by and ""The Global Warming Movement"" became a distant memory. None of it's [predictions](https://cei.org/blog/wrong-again-50-years-failed-eco-pocalyptic-predictions) came to pass. Not a single one. In the early 2000s, Al Gore lost a run for president. You may remember that Al Gore is/was a democrat. This detail becomes important later. After contesting the election and other notable pieces of history- he moved on to do the lecture circuit. Interestingly, his choice of topics was ""Global Warming"" which had rebranded itself to ""Climatology"". He did this by dropping the vast majority of claims which were made in the early 80s, things like the Ozone layer, industrial use of Aerosols and fear of skin cancer- were all out. He focused, almost entirely on a causation fallacy involving  C02 and aggregated temperatures. He claimed world temperatures followed C02 levels and used a graph from the last two hundred years as a visual aid. This is where we get the now infamous ""Hockey Stick Graph"". As you can see from the [graph](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_gRuPC7OQdxc/SotE7QgZkkI/AAAAAAAAAEk/FUOt7dm4KEc/s400/PyrotechnicGore_thumb.jpg) it supported his prediction that all life on earth would be dead by the year 2012. 

Al gore continued his talks and appearances all through the 2000s however, only democrats repeated his material. He was heralded as an advocate for the environment and as time passed, more and more calls for government funding on the subject of climatology began to crop up. But this is not to say that any of it was popular. The so called ""Scientific Community"" (which I would not call a community in any sense of the word) only involved itself on the topic so far as there was funding involved. Outside of that, they kept their distance out of fear of getting mixed up in a ""Political"" contest. Yet as the funding began to flow we started to see more and more academics enter the field of climatology. There was such a low barrier of entry that by 2014 it seemed there was very little difference between an academic and an activist. In some parts of the country it even seemed as if political activism was a requirement to being taken seriously on the topic. Those who were not constantly involving themselves in mainstream protests were often passed over for grants or had their papers dismissed by disinterested publications. 

And this is where we are now. The doomsday prophecies were kept but the actual deadlines were discontinued- even going so far as to label 2100AD as the year the sky falls.

But what is a man to do? You couldn't have talked sense into me back in 1982. I would have told you that the sky was falling, the ozone layer was disappearing and we'd all be dead by 1985.

But what is a man to do? You couldn't have talked sense into me back in 1982. I would have told you that the sky was falling, the ozone layer was disappearing and we'd all be dead by 1985.

Actually I wasn't aware that was a thing. In fact I have been acquainted with many self described 'Climatologists'. What I was pointing out is that this particular individual does not refer to himself as a climatologist nor does subscribe to the theory. In fact if you read through that particular paper, he even goes so far as to attack a variety of talking points you have mentioned.

So what separates him from any non-believer? If he is a climatologist- am I one as well?

TBF- In the early 1980s I was very much a 'climatology believer'. I participated in a variety of protests and eco-demonstrations. Ten years later, I unceremoniously withdrew from the movement as I had reason to suspect it was birthed from a political action and not a scientific one.
