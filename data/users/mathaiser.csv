Importance is a lie/illusion/fabrication

Sure... IMportabt to your human brains... but there is no providence in this life, there is no “right” or “wrong”. There is only the world and what lies before us.  Sure, family, relations, all things innate for our survival and precedence.  But still, even that just plays to our nature.  

It’s the idea of... “we only know life is possible because... here we are.”  

It’s all inert, nothing matters, play to your nature to feel better, sure...  but don’t mistake that for anything other than a catering to a chemical reaction/feeling that succeeds on *THIS* planet.

Even at that it’s pretty weak.  

I’m often concerned with “meaning.”  So many self righteous humans fighting under the guise of “meaning” and “right and wrong”

So much death at the hands of a god.  So much suffering “in the name of.”

I’m worried about people seeking meaning.  So many facsitoidal undertones.

How about this... “Don’t create suffering.”

Let’s take THAT and move forward from there.

In anything you do, don’t create suffering."

Corporate taxes have dropped so they have been able to buy stock back and make record profits pumping the stock market while environmental programs suffer and the regular joes suffer.  

If the Fed cuts rates again, making it easier for people to loan money they no longer can really afford.  Basic prices on food and energy are going up on this inflated curve and the people are still making the same amount of money.  We are just getting *that much less* for our dollar.

Thats my train of thought.  There is no value building, there is no underlying increases in production, there is only tinkering with digital numbers, manipulation, and other bs to keep people going.  

There has to be a reckoning somewhere... with this slow death/unnoticed small changes... people WILL notice a decay... some do already, realizing those in power are squeezing us for more and more and making their game just a bit more accessible to people.  “We can’t make 3% off you fuckers?  Ok, we’ll drop it to 1.5% and YOU SHOULD THANK US.  (But we are still always paying and still bound to this framework of debt).

The Fed is okay in my mind to spur forward motion in the economy, but they are twisting the screws too much and greed is guiding their ship rather than supporting the economy and the American people.

I don’t care about the trade deal... the poor farmers and small businesses that got hosed by Trumps power play *may* come back, but really Trump consolidated business in this country even more.
