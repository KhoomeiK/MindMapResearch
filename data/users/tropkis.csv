It's more personal, than general. I'm not a stereotypical person either, but I *believe* it's a reality for some, and something I've worked on well before the birth of my daughter. Again, I don't  speak for others, but having a child, that's a powerful change, enough to put your heart into perspective. Atleast for me. Taught me soften up. That's all."
