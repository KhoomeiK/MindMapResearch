vegancirclejerk,ff8jvnh,t3_es46cl,1579681923.0,At least a number of the comments condem it
DnD,fefwu3q,t3_eoq3es,1579067809.0,Looks really cool! I just bought it :)
YouShouldKnow,fcvgngv,t1_fcvgkfo,1578001694.0,Keep trying. A few more factors should do the trick
YouShouldKnow,fcvgldf,t1_fcurseh,1578001660.0,Usually there is a process to contact their support teams to unlock it
YouShouldKnow,fcvgj2z,t1_fcusdw9,1578001622.0,I commend you!!!
YouShouldKnow,fcvgask,t1_fcvfs4h,1578001485.0,"It's not perfect, but for the average person it's the best thing you can do"
YouShouldKnow,fcvg8pg,t1_fcvfw7p,1578001450.0,"True, but it's also a pain in the ass to carry keys to lock your car and house, or provide ID everywhere. But based on the risk of real threats in our world, we have adjusted to including these security habits into our daily life.

As out digital accounts become more valuable to us, we have to learn to adopt security habits to protect them."
YouShouldKnow,fcvfy7b,t1_fcvdagf,1578001274.0,"Biometric tokens are much stronger than passwords. You should still use 2FA, but your two 'factors' could be a fingerprint and then a authenticator app"
YouShouldKnow,fcvfm2l,t1_fcuzdyx,1578001074.0,"Phishing is one way. 

For instance, let's say you get an email from ""Steam"" claiming that some of your wishlist items are on sale. You link the link and you are taken to a webpage that looks JUST like the official steam page. You log in (which steals you username/password combo). In the back end of the site, they have it set up so that it actually logs you into the real steam on their end, prompting the 2FA email to be sent. 

After you log into the fake site, the attackers also simulate the 2FA prompt. You type I thinking nothing is wrong, and then it is sent through to your real account on the back end and logs the attackers in."
YouShouldKnow,fcumqn4,t1_fcu34kd,1577984331.0,"I mean--it's not trivial. It can be done, but you would have to be the victim of a targeted attack by someone who knows what they are doing. If that is the case, then you likely are screwed if you are not practicing a *range* of good cyber hygiene habits."
YouShouldKnow,fcummgw,t1_fcu2rix,1577984261.0,Yep! [https://duo.com/](https://duo.com/)
YouShouldKnow,fcumfsi,t1_fcu2lza,1577984153.0,If your password is phished then it's vulnerable--2FA is still the more ideal option.
YouShouldKnow,fcumc37,t1_fcu2dme,1577984093.0,"Yep! [Check out their official post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/93qnm5/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_you_need_to/) that explains what happened. I actually included that in my first draft, but the auto-mod killed my post because YSK can't contain any information about Reddit"
YouShouldKnow,fcum0bh,t1_fcu017r,1577983911.0,Not unless it's linked to an account (like Google or Microsoft)
YouShouldKnow,fcul950,t1_fcuh3uz,1577983476.0,More and more are offering it though! I was surprised!
YouShouldKnow,fcul6sr,t1_fcu8euh,1577983438.0,"That helps against credential stuffing, but if the password is phished/guessed/stolen then it can still be compromised. 2FA is still the better option. 

That being said, using all different passwords is super important."
VeganFoodPorn,fctfz12,t1_fcstjz3,1577942032.0,"Gah, I forgot to add that to the recipe! I made two of these but ran out of avacado for the 2nd. I updated the recipe."
VeganFoodPorn,fcry4am,t3_eimpvv,1577908213.0,"**The recipe:** 

* Pan Toasted whole wheat bread with vegan butter 
* Vegan Mayo 
* Lettuce and sliced tomatoes and avocados
* Tofu ""Bacon"" (Full recipe: [https://youtu.be/DcFAeNNLsNo](https://youtu.be/DcFAeNNLsNo))

It was shockingly really good.  I don't think it tastes like bacon, but it's really a wonderful savory salty filling that makes a really good substitute for a BLT."
OSINT,fc9pyx1,t1_fc95cyj,1577556437.0,"Dang, it's pretty cool to see an author directly respond to consumers. Your books are *killer*, thanks."
CEH,fc829nq,t3_egkvnk,1577524994.0,"As a general pro tip: **always pick the answer that is** ***more right****.* My wife is a nurse and that was the biggest thing she kept in mind in order to pass the NCLEX. That advice alone has got me passing some of my hardest IT certs (CEH included). 

So if this was really on the exam, then I would go with ""covert channel."" Stego is technically a covert channel, but it gives you more options. As as someone else said, stego isn't really good for transferring lots of information, so  you might pick a different covert channel."
AskTeachers,fb65hv6,t3_ebmadh,1576541881.0,"One of the biggest things you need to keep in mind with Lit essays is to really understand the prompt, as well as they expected mode (i.e., are you supposed to do a deep-dive on a character? Are you looking at symbols? Are you comparing two things?)  


I would say that the most important thing you can do is to *always* back up a claim with in-text examples. They can be specific quotes, or you can also even generally talk about how a character acts."
