And the reason why it’s cheap and not smart like I know y’all want to say is because if the NFC did it, the game would never end since nobody wants to throw. The catches he made were nice but not that impressive since he had gloves on"

trashy,ff6vri6,t1_ff6sjdd,1579635885.0,">	So your comment in fact makes it more likely the hosts’ comment is true.

Just because you say that doesn’t make it true. 

 I said that we don’t know either side of the story and to initially smite me for thinking I was blindly believing the reviewer while you blindly believe the host is hilarious."
trashy,ff6ro37,t1_ff6ppjx,1579633459.0,". I never even implied that I was blindly believing the person who posted the review. I don’t blindly believe any side, there’s just nothing to substantiate either claim and the host obviously has motives to disparage any claims against them regardless of authenticity. I don’t completely ignore all reviews, I just don’t act like these claims on the internet are definitively correct for either side. 

Music and drugs (think it’s fair to say it’s likely marijauna) sound like a pretty normal night for somebody in their early 20s on vacation, hanging with friends. We don’t know the extent of damage to furniture, I can completely see a host throwing that in after seeing a scratch or something minor just to try to further justify their side. 

It’s silly that everybody here just assumes the host is telling the truth and the person is indisputably trashy when we’ve only seen one very vague side of the story."

And you’re just referencing one play where like you said, many people did enjoy the way he called it. If you listen to him, he regularly gets pretty excited about plays and isn’t afraid to say things other commentators don’t. Recently he’s really started having fun with it and his calls have been pretty great. This is just personal opinion but I’ll take that over the drab and often blatantly biased narration of Al Michaels any day."
nfl,ff3ruym,t1_ff3r2wb,1579547500.0,I’ll take his helmet catch call over Al Michael’s call of SB52 any day. I actually appreciated Buck not speaking over the crowd and letting the moment marinate.
nfl,ff3p6eb,t1_ff3kzk6,1579545862.0,Never understood the hatred for Buck here. He’s not the best play-by-play guy but he’s not that bad at all. He’s had more good calls than bad.

I’ve seen Daniel Jones and Russ get multiple calls that a non QB wouldn’t have in a single game alone. I know it’s a circlejerk that QBs get calls here and it can be overblown but you haven’t watched any NFL if you think it just doesn’t happen."
nfl,ff1kl0f,t1_ff1jn2b,1579480689.0,The point is the tackler has literally no control of whether he gets a penalty or not if he goes for a diving hit like they typically would in that situation and Mahomes slides.

If you trust she’s a good driver, what’s the difference between her and your last girlfriend? I would assume after 8 months of being together, you would know her enough to either give her an actual reason you prefer her not driving it or tell her/us why it’s different than your last girlfriend. 

Also it’s worth mentioning that getting dressed up for a wedding, and taking public transport 2 hours away sounds absolutely dreadful. I understand you wanting to take care of your car but if you have her take public transport instead, that will reflect horribly on you."

AskReddit,fehjlqy,t3_ep6c2o,1579117874.0,"I have a friend who comes off as the nicest guy you meet, really outgoing and seems like a super genuine guy. He’ll never take the last seat, will gladly hold the door for those waiting, will listen enthusiastically to you telling a short story. All the easy stuff. To those who’ve just met him, he couldn’t be any nicer. 

The thing is, when it’s not the easy stuff, when it’s something that will be an actual inconvenience to him, he won’t budge or compromise. He will stand headstrong and has no problem inconveniencing others, especially in situations where they won’t find out. He’ll litter and steal when he thinks nobody is watching and lives his life the way *he* wants to, disregarding the effects of his actions. 

I finally realized that he wasn’t a genuinely good person, he was only concerned with others believing he was a good person. Or maybe he genuinely wants to be a good person and justified that by the small, easy things he does while excusing the rest. He’s still my friend but I always cringe watching him put on his nice guy song and dance for somebody new considering how fake it all seems now."
