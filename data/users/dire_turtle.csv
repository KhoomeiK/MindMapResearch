unpopularopinion,ff9ixfl,t3_erzvar,1579713991.0,"Yes, but here's how I think you're actually organizing people to get this information:

Progressives are going to be people who prioritize relationships and community. 
Conservatives are going to be people who prioritize safety and self-sufficiency. 

All of these things are important, and some of these values may show up physically. 

To say that you can tell what political opinions someone has based on their dressed is dumb. You're guessing with no way of actually knowing. If you're ever right, you don't know when. 

You want permission to write people off based on your perceptions. Humans don't work that way."

psychotherapy,ff44fsk,t1_ff3vsmf,1579555314.0,"Doctors work on the body. Therapists work on the mind. Psychiatrists are doctors trying to chemically assist the mind as it currently is. 

Therapy requires the client's mind. 
Medication only requires their body. 
Psychiatry focuses on medicating the body to manage the mind. 

Medication to manage the mind is like coping skills to manage it. They keep things from crossing a problem threshold. 

Healing the mind takes therapy (processing emotionally-charged experiences into a more tolerable narrative). Psychiatrists get the additional and separate tool of medication, and that's the tool people seek them out for primarily, not their therapy skills. 

My personal opinion is that the best mind healer would be a psychiatrist who uses medication to manage symptoms but utilizes therapy mostly as the vehicle for change. There's just not going to be many because you can pay a therapist less so just focus on that while a monkey shrink will throw meds at symptoms based on a 3 min conversation. 

So ask yourself what you want to do. If it's manage psychotic symptoms with evidenced based recommendations, psychiatry seems far more appropriate and lucrative. If it's to sit, listen, and facilitate therapy, psychotherapy is your path.

I believe therapy was the right direction for me because of my drive to connect with people through conversation. Medication is a lot more 1-directional; whereas, therapy is more collaborative."

Intelligence is used in many ways. But let's be honest, being that wealthy and famous is absolutely relevant to survival in regards to resource gathering and connectedness to others. I don't think they understand that's why they watch, but I believe the appeal of that content isn't necessarily about low intelligence, rather people who easily dissociate from reality in order to enjoy that fantasy. 

It's just like watching Batman though. I know I'm not Batman, but goddamn it's cool being him for a 2-hour movie. We all escape. That is the point of mindfulness, to keep us here.

I don't think it's fair to call him or anyone who ventures into new theoretical territory a sham. To posit something novel takes a lot of bravery if the person is actually doing honest work. We need these minds taking a different approach so we know where more dead ends are. 

So yes, I agree with you. Let's be skeptical and honest about the bullshit, but our work needs both diligent science and weird/novel deas to pursue. Freud and Peterson demonstrate alternative ways to consider the problems we're all trying to solve. They may be wrong on some things, but I attribute that as trying to dig deeper than the initial framing of the problem.

Responsibility is kind of obscure, but within the context of ""hygiene and responsibility,"" I think you may mean the idea of ""discipline"" or Discipline is obedience of the mind to the body. 

This is absolutely learned through tasks like hygiene and exercise, but also tier 2/Security needs like working, paying bills, cleaning the house, etc.   


You can think of the needs ranking within the subcategories based on how immediate the resulting consequences are. So hygiene ranges from like 1.4 (washing hands to avoid flu) to like 1.8 (flossing to avoid gum disease). Exercise might be closer to 1.1 or something because it gives you an instant and powerful response. Breathing and homeostasis/vitals would be 1.0."

""Hey [kid], you seem upset about this. What's going on?""
*dramatic word vomit*
Based on what they focus most on, ""That sounds overwhelming"" (whatever emotion you hear the most from them). 

We process by thinking/talking about stuff while we're presently emotionally engaged with it. So the more I can just be present and notice/validate the emotions they're showing/reporting, the more they will continue to explore the neural pathways.

When do you get into ugly territory about what others decide is best for their child? 

Education and communication should be the keys for this, not making it a crime IMO."
tifu,fcu6cmk,t3_eislla,1577973625.0,This is what I experienced being around my younger cousins. Religious people can sometimes be the least faithful. Hurts being treated like an evil.

>For someone that sees life with a soul, how do we teach karma?

I'm new to Buddhism myself, and I get the feeling that this may be an area of growth for me. Could you give me your ""further reading"" summary for this? The more succinct for me at this point, the better."
Buddhism,fcsb7fh,t1_fcsb0uf,1577914107.0,LSD was even more helpful in achieving some reference for how beautiful perspective can be.
Buddhism,fcsb0uf,t3_eikh6h,1577914023.0,"I'm dipping my toe into Buddhism, and I'm not taking this ""do/don't"" approach as a 31 yo. I'm going about this with the understanding that sober life is as pure as my senses get, so I should value that clarity. 

Likewise, I also enjoy the emotional experience of pot. It has allowed me to look at the world with the wonder of childhood. That's precious to me because of the heavy work I do. It helps me maintain the attitude that drives me deeper into compassion, empathy, and service to others."

tifu,fcs1loe,t3_eiht41,1577910033.0,"Hot girls are the hardest to relax around, imo. I kept going soft the first few times I had sex with my ex because I was so intimidated. Communication and a little more time being vulnerable with each other will smooth it over. 

Keep going, and act like the stud she thinks you are. You'll never understand how you're the guy she picked, so just accept your fate for what it is: a hot girl wants your peentis."
psychology,fcrfh5g,t1_fcr44av,1577901134.0,That's how I see it. We'd all our souls for a hot enough woman.
