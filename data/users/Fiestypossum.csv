JustNoSO,ffes302,t3_esww1d,1579862811.0,"Lol when my son was born he was up every single 1.5 to 2 hours for a feed, without fail, 247. EVERY single time the baby woke up crying my ex would go ""uhhh should I make a bottle?"" And literally would not go and do it until I said ""yes please"". Every single time for fucking weeks and weeks until I lost my shit completely and started doing it myself. I was recovering from a very traumatic C-section."
