illnessfakersgonewild,ffh512k,t1_ffh3arr,1579923299.0,"It’s important to me that people understand paralysis if they want to understand it. I think demystifying is an important part of advocacy, because it’s easy for a lack of understanding to turn into fear or prejudice. I would never tell someone that it’s their job to advocate like that if they didn’t want to. That’s just what I do because I chose to. It’s appalling to me that someone would say that a kid has a responsibility to advocate for their illness."
ftm,ffgtqhf,t3_etjubz,1579914827.0,"Hormones don’t necessarily make people become unhinged. I was super anxious and somewhat moody and prone to anger before I started T and all of those issues improved dramatically, because they were caused my intense dysphoria. The doctor is probably going to start him on a low dose and increase it gradually, which will help with the adjustment period, and they’ll be watching him closely. Tbh I wouldn’t suggest saying something about this to him right now because you won’t be able to change his mind. Just try to be there for him and support him, and it will work out."
FundieSnark,ffgqxnz,t1_ffgqok2,1579912796.0,"Not to be serious but they believe so strongly that there’s a single “right” and “wrong” and generally view the world in very binary terms. Trans people are threatening a fundamental part of their beliefs about how the world works because we exist outside of those rules. 

I’ve never put that much thought into what other people’s genitalia look like but to each their own I guess"

illnessfakersgonewild,ffgnjdr,t3_ethv7x,1579910387.0,"“My needed medical device broke. This is morally repugnant.” It’s inconvenient for her and seriously problematic for actual sick/disabled people. When my wheelchair breaks it’s a major problem, but it’s not a moral issue. Even after some of the shit I’ve dealt with from my DME provider I wouldn’t use a word as strong as “repugnant” to describe them. She is using a highly specialized medical service, it can take time to get in. It’s still usable and she doesn’t even use it for nutrition. She’s going to have to wait."
fatlogic,ffe8h3f,t3_et4zff,1579839569.0,"It’s interesting that they chose this term, because embodiment in the social sciences is about how our minds and bodies interact and form our identities, shaping how we perceive and interact with the world. So this sounds like weight loss is threatening some fundamental part of who they are as people. I’m guessing that’s not what they meant, but as a social science student that statement felt super dramatic. It’s one thing to say that dieting involves ignoring your body’s messages and suggesting that that could be unhealthy (not saying it is but I’ve seen the argument) but it’s something else to call it disembodiment."
spinalcordinjuries,ffdio1p,t3_escfig,1579821682.0,"I want to go camping so bad, I haven’t been since I could walk (I’m 4 years out). My problem rn is that I live in Florida and I’m in college, so my only free time to go is summer and it gets way too hot for camping. I’m also a little nervous about my bowel program when I go but I haven’t put much thought into planning a trip yet."
illnessfakersgonewild,ffam6jp,t1_ffaetsn,1579739207.0,"People definitely say that disabled people can’t/don’t have sex, but he still is really extra about it. There are good ways to educate people on this issue and what he’s doing ain’t it. If anyone is willing to pay for it then that’s on them, though I’m disgusted that he’s using a marginalized population that he’s not part of to make money."
FundieSnark,ffahnxa,t1_ffahhln,1579735966.0,"I don’t think so, although I’m United Methodist (raised mostly fundie-lite by step dad but mom was UMC) so I don’t have the moral conflict of liking them without believing them. But there is something nice about singing them even outside of the messages."
