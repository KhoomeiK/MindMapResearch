I understand your constipation problem. As I age, it happens easily for me as well. It’s usually due poor eating on my part and dehydration. I can’t seem to get enough water in my day."

NoStupidQuestions,fd6oldt,t3_ek6x62,1578193841.0,"Idk about forcing yourself to eat but your sense of taste changes every few years. Things that you didn’t like before you may enjoy now or as you get older. 

When I was younger, I did not like tomatoes. As a a you lung adult I realized that the texture of the seeds. I would eat seeded tomatoes in recipes and enjoy them. Now I eat them with seeds or without. 

My son went through a stage when he was in his teens where any type of Asian food, including rice made him nearly vomit at the table. Now as an adult he enjoys rice and all sorts of Asian food. 

The like or dislike of a food can be triggered by sight, smell, or texture. I have a problem with some textures. I don’t care for mushy thing like pudding, pumpkin pie or overcooked vegetables. I avoid those but am willing to try other foods. 

Take one bite or sip of a food or drink that you think you don’t like and try it again.  You might find that you enjoy it now."
