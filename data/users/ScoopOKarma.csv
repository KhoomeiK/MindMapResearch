aww,ff9yukq,t1_ff9i0o5,1579724443.0,Their videos are from 2015 and say they were fosters at that time. I really hope they were adopted together  :(
aww,feo4xif,t3_eq4asy,1579295148.0,What a little sweetie. The back foot kick up is the cutest part.

aww,fe8fn5j,t3_eo135x,1578925639.0,"Cuties!! Big sister definitely has the swagger which implies she is thinking ""you're welcome, idiot"" as she walks away though. In true cat fashion. lol"
ImpracticalJokers,fdruat9,t1_fdrrhnp,1578689824.0,Incorrect based on direct experience. I was just chilling in the background on the steps of a location they were shooting and had to go through exactly what I outlined above.
cats,fdrg2b7,t1_fdrdhak,1578684032.0,The (opposite direction) same thing happened to my brother which is why his female cat is named Paul.
ImpracticalJokers,fdrfl3p,t3_emu2c9,1578683825.0,"Anyone who is in sight of the camera gets asked for consent, including folks in the background. You have to sign a waiver and also have your picture taken along with it as security proof. If folks are blurred, it's because they either said no, or just left the shooting area before the crew could stop them for a waiver."
TheCircleTV,fdrez4i,t1_fdregfk,1578683631.0,"Yes he was trying to do a bit as ""Adam"" but Alex actually is an artist and it did not come off as a total joke but also something that was a slight slip into the real side of him."

horror,fdr032p,t3_emt77x,1578677741.0,"Would You Rather was a fun watch with a pretty simple storyline. 

Maniac (the remake with Elijah Wood) was excellent all around. I am constantly recommending this because I feel like it flew under the radar."
Midsommar,fdqs7mq,t3_emgccu,1578673753.0,"I would also echo the suggestion of finding a white dress and making it yourself. If you're not good with embroidery, get some iron on paper for fabric and you can print off some runes and iron them on yourself.  

&#x200B;

If you don't want to bother with either of those, then search ""Midsommar dress"" on Amazon and you get a few floral dresses that will work in a pinch to get the general point across."
TheCircleTV,fdqcyau,t3_emmy0o,1578663332.0,"Agreed, I find him super annoying, but I also am giving him a very slight benefit of the doubt as I know editing choices on shows like this can also give misrepresentations of people. He comes off as super ego, like he automatically assumes he is smarter than everyone else in the game though. Overall, I do find him hella irksome.    


I'm frustrated by everyone though as I feel like they are not really listening to what each other is saying sometimes. Alex slipped and let Adam divulge that he was an art student during the portrait episode. The players seemed to acknowledge it but no one dug any deeper that this was out of the norm for he fake profile, which could have been a tip off that he was a fake.   


Same with the girls and the period chat, if they were really thinking about it they would have felt a bit more ""off"" with Seaburn's comment contributions."

todayilearned,fd29e36,t1_fd0ketg,1578143743.0,No! She eventually healed and continued skydiving. That’s the craziest part to me.

television,fanvsj7,t1_fanv152,1576251739.0,That seems to be the popular consensus. Mulaney has enough good credit built up that I’ll give whatever he does a shot.
