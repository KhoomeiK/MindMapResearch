Than what I feel for za


No sweeter song, no sausage raw

There is no greater thrill

Than what cheese brings to me

No sweeter song

Than what mushrooms sing, sing to me

You're the sweetest pepper

I have ever known

And to think that you are mine alone

There is no greater love

In all the world, I can't deny

No greater love

Than what I feel for pie"

I was recently fired from a band for not coming to a rehearsal. I had notified them two days prior that I had another thing I needed to tend to, and made it clear I wouldn't be there. This band meant everything to me and I had been one of the more responsible and present members. Often other members would sleep through rehearsal or be extremely hungover even in the evening and we weren't productive during rehearsals. 

Now, granted, we had had a ""come to Jesus"" talk about fixing these issues. I had just figured because I rarely skipped practice and that I had given my all for years I would be in the clear.

I never asked to be paid for a single gig, merchandise split, royalties, none of it. I truly believed in the group and thought of them and the surrounding friend group to be a kind of family. They basically blacklisted me and I haven't heard a peep from any one of my ""friends"" since the band decided to ""take a break from me"". 

This stung a bit more as this last year I really struggled with substance abuse (less so than other members), severe depression and anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Things were also falling apart with my then girlfriend (also part of the friend group), and things just all fell apart completely at once. No one gave me a chance to explain or even an opportunity to repair things, just radio silence.

I've already filed for copyrights to the songs and other properties. I've got a friend who's a lawyer, wants to help me out, and has a fair amount of experience in suits like this. I'm ready to get my financial portion of everything they do, royalties for every performance and recording they release, and all the songs that have my touch. I probably won't pull the trigger, but knowing I have that power against people I feel so abandoned by is comforting somehow."

AskReddit,fcv2tuk,t3_eixo6r,1577993485.0,"Musician. 

I can say from personal experience this profession is challenging to say the least. Its ***insanely*** competitive. You spend thousands of hours practicing to become proficient, thousands of dollars on professional grade instruments, and travel expenses to and from gigs. Only to fight for *maybe* $100 per gig that could last up to three or four hours. 

Being that most gigs are in city areas, cost of living comes to factor in as well. Most musicians don't make much more than around $20-30k a year, so often living in accessible areas close to where they work just isn't feasible. This drives up transport costs or you live in bad neighborhoods closer to where you work.

If you make it a bit bigger the money does get slightly better, but the rampant alcohol, drug, and personal/body abuse often catches people early or tears them apart in the long run. You work closely with a lot of service industry folk, and both professions are notorious for having substance problems."
