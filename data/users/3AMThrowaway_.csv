depression,fdrygek,t3_emw8x6,1578691605.0,"Technically yes. Councilors are legally not allowed to tell anyone anything that you want to be kept private, but it gets messy with self harm. See, they are allowed to tell people (and are basically required to) if the information involves someone being hurt/killed. For example, if you said “I’m am going to murder _______ today” they would have to report that. On top of that, they are required to report anything harmful to the student. If you said “My parents are stabbing me every day” they would have to report that. You can see how things get really weird when it comes to self harm. Technically, someone is getting hurt, but it’s you... so i don’t exactly know where that falls. I would say yes just to be safe"

depression,fd886qw,t3_ekaan1,1578215083.0,"1. People of older generations don’t really get how debilitating depression and other mental illnesses are. I’m sure I. 10+ years studies will come out about why this generation has such a high number of people with depression, but until then, just power through it. I know it’s not exactly helpful, but I’m really not anyone to be giving advice.

2. You are just as important as everyone else here. Everyone that posts things like this are all going through the same stuff we all are. Even if no one else sees this post, it’s not because you aren’t important, it’s because of Reddit being weird."

depression,fd85wv5,t3_ek5e2z,1578214263.0,"I completely agree. No one who seriously harms themselves wants people to find out. The reason I have self harmed before is because it distracts me from mental pain. “Oh shit I need to go get a band aid this fucking hurts” is 100 times better than “I want to die. No one will miss me” in my mind at least.

depression,fd84r80,t3_eka7gw,1578213918.0,Yep. Depression really kicks you while your down. So many things compile on each other and then the side effects of those things make it worse to the point to where it breaks people.
