5. I think taking a home office deduction for an entire year would be pushing it. The requirement is that the space be used exclusively for the business. You would most likely have a hard time proving that.

We have had one bad company after another, Indymac, Ocwen, PHH over the years. When I called to deal with an issue, I got someone who spoke very accented English and could only work off a script.
