This article is bs."
MrRobot,fei3ee8,t1_feghty1,1579129401.0,Damnit the irony about having a popular social media account that will get you free merch for Mr Robot.
wholesomememes,fdi0gqh,t1_fdhxthx,1578433527.0,They can this meme is fucking stupid. They are talking about milk chocolate except the milk in milk chocolate is basically a filler.
wholesomememes,fdi0a87,t1_fdht6k1,1578433428.0,If anything its a dig at it the fuck?
wholesomememes,fdi084s,t3_eleejn,1578433396.0,ok but there is vegan chocolate candy they just simply don't add milk to make milk chocolate. Milk is basically a filler in chocolate anyways.
MrRobot,fdht3mo,t3_el2p7b,1578429661.0, so funny to laugh about nuclear holocaust
MrRobot,fdhsk16,t3_el869z,1578429357.0,god I hate how the first thing I get from googling st elmos fire is a stupid fucking song and movie.

Wasn't satisfied at all with the ending or how they handled it. I guess in a way it subverted my own expectations lol"
MrRobot,fdho685,t1_fdevj0e,1578426788.0,I disagree the nominated shows are practically never widely watched shows.
MrRobot,fdhnypa,t1_fdelzrk,1578426664.0,Meh its more accurate to say financed. Also Comcast owns USA which greenlit Mr Robot so also ironic.
AskReddit,fdhnqq6,t3_eled64,1578426530.0,Redditors hating redditors but summarizing it as reddit being dumb then subsequentially having the comment upvoted.
MrRobot,fdc5p2w,t1_fdbrruu,1578267613.0,btw is it for season 4 or season 3? The timing is weird so I don't even know which one they are counting?
MrRobot,fdbfs3c,t1_fda2czk,1578256956.0,It's weird af you need a cable subscription to access the official live stream on the nbc website. Maybe there will be a youtube one?

MrRobot,fczexfd,t1_fcyuevq,1578099707.0,The irony is Elliot(Mastermind) was Tyler Durden the whole time not Mr Robot.
MrRobot,fcwjzel,t1_fcvzcdy,1578027699.0,I don't agree. Didn't MR call off the hack off one point and that made Darlene mad? I'm not sure she's actually the leader though I think she clearly took over in season 2.
todayilearned,fcvh2nl,t3_eixm6b,1578001943.0,Ok thats where the word comes from but I'm pretty sure eating food at a public establishment predates that.
todayilearned,fct3q7d,t1_fcsw6i5,1577932087.0,Exactly and sometimes it might be another variable that people haven't considered which actually caused the negative side effect.
todayilearned,fct3fxk,t1_fct0yh5,1577931876.0,"why do people oversimplify this? There are conditions worth medicating even psychiatry. Obviously most people probably shouldn't be taking antidepressants but for many they help people get through the day. Some people absolutely need ADHD meds to do anything. If you are advocating for doctors to stop over prescribing then I hope you advocate for shorter work days, improved mental health funding, and generally things that will contribute to a healthier person."

movies,fcnvf6h,t1_fcmw1vc,1577819207.0,"I don't care if I'm a bigot towards Catholics because they are bigots towards people like me. They actively ally with people who want to ban gay/trans people. No I don't give a flying fuck if the church blew up tomorrow. I would be ok if they cleaned their shit up but your take is brain dead regressed monkey levels of stupid. 

No I don't hate someone born in another country because thats not their choice. You have a choice to be Catholic or not.  You have a choice to be outspoken about their problems and the majority do not speak out against. Pathetic."
OutOfTheLoop,fclp3y0,t1_fclikxd,1577753045.0,"Murder is premeditated disingenuous cunt. Plus that's whataboutism.

Disappearing dissenters is actual murder and apparently general censorship is so much better!"
Futurology,fcl1t36,t1_fckxb65,1577737958.0,Wow thats even worse..Especially if you are in some state that hates minimum wage workers.
movies,fckz484,t1_fckvlt1,1577736298.0,"Sure follow Christ's message and then cover up any pedo abuse and call it a conspiracy to infiltrate the church by freemasons [under the head of the jews](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/catholics-and-conspiracies) instead of fucking owning up to accountability and getting rid of it.    


Not to mention the religion itself is based on a God that has committed multiple mass genocides but gets triggered if you don't dedicate your life to worship and repent your sins to a 12% chance of being a pedo than masochistically beg for indulgences that take away your purgatory time.

I literally know this priest who some of my family loves who said the 'abuse thing was overblown in the media'. Many other priests I served under as an altar server had a hard on for being controlling(no different than some sociopath in the business world) and/or acting as some holier than thou royal figure.   


The Catholic Church is an absolute disgrace to humanity."
Futurology,fckvvrg,t1_fcknidz,1577734319.0,Thats just stupid while I sympathize with him a new pair of glasses aren't like thousands of dollars. Usually a couple hundred for appt plus frames.

science,fcja92f,t1_fcj4iqz,1577681181.0,True but at least women will still support each other internally.
science,fcj9v9p,t1_fcj44dp,1577680894.0,"Women are now doing better in school and in the workplace because we are valuing them more so they dont develop depression/addictive problems. They have a support network so they are able to pick themselves up when they fall. This isnt the same case for men instead they are rejected and devalued constantly(outside of high status/rich families).

At least that's my hypothesis I would love to see tested."
science,fcj9i8e,t1_fcizif1,1577680624.0,I disagree because these guys straight up get violent. Many people get slightly upset over core values only.
OutOfTheLoop,fchu4xu,t1_fch26yc,1577654165.0,What brainlet decided on that?
OutOfTheLoop,fchtuod,t1_fcfd5d0,1577654066.0,How does every parent have the same story. Obviously it's part bullshit.

happy,fc9ti0z,t1_fc7jzwj,1577557991.0,Unless you are worried about a violent ex this is sparking some red flags.
FairbanksClassic,fc7rckx,t1_fc7o992,1577516657.0,You need programs to do both. OPs accused is probably using autohotkey which is what multiboxxers use also.
todayilearned,fc7l6bf,t1_fc7incm,1577511002.0,I guess I meant what were the tells regarding his mannerisms that indicated traumatized?

todayilearned,fc7gx6r,t1_fc6koxl,1577507094.0,The interesting tidbit is bullying is the type of stress that can turn someone into a Darth Vader.
todayilearned,fc7ggcm,t1_fc6iple,1577506692.0,No it's that once you are past 25 you are less likely to get it if you are male.
todayilearned,fc7g3ui,t1_fc6du4c,1577506390.0,Probably because he was being bullied.

science,fc76h4u,t1_fc57s5h,1577498827.0,"CBD has helped my social anxiety/paranoia but not panic attacks. Wellbutrin has practically cured my panic attacks but increases social anxiety. 

But I dont think it's ok to take both together so now I'm on wellbutrin only and my panic attacks are gone but feel more shame and resistance to socialize."
science,fc769ks,t1_fc58smm,1577498669.0,Yeah it all feeds into each other. Kind of like how being poor leads to lots of problems outside of being able to afford things.
