Here is the target bitrate of The Revenant (4k, possibly HDR I don't recall): [https://i.imgur.com/4Q5OYKT.png](https://i.imgur.com/4Q5OYKT.png)

It is practically 3x higher than Netflix HIGHEST bitrate. (The tar. bitrate is 44Mb/s)

This is why I do not subscribe to Netflix, for comparison a lot of 1080p TV shows that are ripped from Amazon Prime (such as GoT) are \~10Mb/s, yet 4k is 4x the pixel count of 1080p, therefore you should expect roughly 4x the bitrate to accommodate.

If you value quality, or have a 4k TV, torrenting is the best way to get the best films as they are almost always encodes of BluRay rips, with 4x the bitrate.

The Revenant details screenshot is about 50GB in size, high bitrate 4k is extremely large. In addition, it is x265, which has smaller file sizes than x264, thus greater compression.

Smart TVs typically have a 100Mb switch, meaning SOME 4k movies will buffer even on local stream via Plex/network drive, which is why I like to target \~50Mb/s

It was introduced about 1-2 years ago, it basically complements another system called Prime Status, you can buy this or get to level 21 to unlock it for free. The idea is cheaters won't survive long enough to get into this. So yes cheaters are likely rampant if you haven't got Prime.

Trust Factor is a bit different, and it takes a few undisclosed factors into account, such as CS:GO hours played, number of times reported, number of commends, /r/globaloffensive has theorized that things like total game count, overall standing of your steam account is taken into account.

If you have a relatively new account with just CS:GO and a handful of other games, I expect your trust factor will be quite low, so you will likely get paired with other low trust factor accounts (such as cheaters, who often play on alternate accounts since the game is F2P).

You only get cheaters if you have a shitty trust factor, e.g. steam accounts that aren't very old, not enough spent, etc.

Cheating really isn't as bad as you are making it out to be. I have over 2000 hours in the game unfortunately, and whilst cheaters do exist they don't survive VAC or overwatch long enough for me to encounter them with my not so bad trust factor."

The next generation of that family MUST be good, impartial, democratic or the next generation of this country will pull it down.

I don't like the monarchy, but replacing it would be more difficult than just tolerating them. They don't do anything significant, they don't play a part in politics. So long as they continue to avoid rocking the boat, and they continue to live without really saying anything or trying to influence the people's views - they should go on forever.

We also have the most famous monarchy on the planet, most influential. It is a powerful tool, diplomatically."
ukpolitics,fek4xpy,t1_fejykp8,1579192694.0,"Exactly, now the UK has left it now only has a single nation on the UNSC (France), it only has 3 top 10 GDP's (Germany, France, Italy).

In every perceivable way, the EU is weakened by the UK's exit. The UK may be weakened even more, though.

The EU isn't as powerful as the USA, for example. Despite the combined GDP of both being very similar, the combined EU army would come close to matching all branches of the US Military. The only way the EU can become powerful is brute force, having so many member states it is impossible to ignore as a superpower.

The loss of Europe's 2nd largest economy really hurts that.

EDIT: UK hasn't left yet, few weeks this comment will be accurate."

The  UK's initial invasion force was 46,000 troops, the US sent 336,000  ground forces, 64,000 air personnel, 63,000 navy personnel.

However,  British special forces were used quite a lot in Iraq, but again the US  also has special forces and more of them - the US didn't need any help  to remove Saddam Hussein, it just helps that your allies are backing you  up.

All the UK did really was tag along.

EDIT: That's not 46,000 troops of the British Army, that is 46,000 troops combined. The troops of the BA were \~25,000, the rest are air force, navy or support personnel. If anyone still thinks the UK wasn't anything but moral support, how do you explain the US Army having over 13x the number of ground troops?"
