antiwork,ffdu5fx,t1_ffbux5n,1579828998.0,I support both Bernie and Yang but how exactly would giving every citizen $1000 a month not help them? Especially those who want to work less like lots of people on this sub.
antiwork,ffdu0yn,t1_ffd6mtk,1579828907.0,I can't comprehend why someone would support Biden. Especially after some of things he's said both on and off the debate stage. Sure he's a better choice than Trump but that's the only positive thing I can say about him.
PKA,ffdto8b,t1_ffbxky9,1579828657.0,It's not nearly as mean as some of the things Kyle has said on PKA. Especially about Wings.
PKA,ffdtjv3,t1_ffbtx1z,1579828572.0,Well he make A LOT of money from the FPS Russia channel and all the sponsorships. That along with the money from PKA is more than enough.
PKA,ffdtdtp,t1_ffca49p,1579828452.0,Or running maybe? He seemed to not mind going for long distance runs when the fitness challenge was happening.
PKA,ffdt5s3,t1_ff2y8xi,1579828288.0,I don't know why he kept repeating the same thing.
trashy,ffdhjfl,t1_ffdes6q,1579820999.0,You just gave me a great idea! Thanks!
PKA,ffbeh50,t1_ffb8a2p,1579761817.0,"I agree with the first part. I'm personally ok with not going on vacations, driving a shitty car and having cheap hobbies if it means I can work less or at least put less effort into anything related to work."
PKA,ffb7cjt,t1_ffb63e6,1579753803.0,"Not everyone, read the other comment in this thread. There are some people out there who wouldn't know what to do with themselves if they had their entire day every day to do anything.

And what makes you think someone who doesn't care AT ALL about going to school or working would put in the effort to get a degree or learn a trade?"
PKA,ffaurly,t1_ffa2ums,1579744962.0,It would help if he developed a few more hobbies that allow for goal setting. Like learning an instrument for example.
PKA,ffaulud,t1_ffa2awv,1579744854.0,"I can respect that you feel the need to work and be ""productive"" but I have no problem with spending all my time on my hobbies (video games being one of them). I've done it for years before and it's the happiest I've ever been. Being employed or in school are not things I enjoy or want to spend any time doing."
PKA,ffauc86,t1_ff9zae7,1579744679.0,Well Kyle lives the dream live so yea you should try it out! Maybe it's not the same for others but I'm the happiest when I get to spend all my time how I want. I would much rather partake in my hobbies than work or go to school even for years on end.
antiwork,fface3z,t1_ffab63v,1579732228.0,"80+ hour weeks are still common in many places. Japan is a good example of this with their 996 ""salaryman"" schedule. Europe is one of the best places to live if you want to avoid being part of a culture obsessed with work but even in Europe many people work long hours. The difference is they get a lot more time off."
antiwork,ff8lbpo,t1_ff8ix5s,1579684081.0,Sounds like an easy job.
antiwork,ff8fyyb,t1_ff8fc0p,1579676787.0,What's that?
antiwork,ff8ffk0,t3_es51w9,1579676144.0,The 40hr work week is one of the greatest injustices in the developed world yet almost no one seems to speak out about it.

antiwork,ff7nxe7,t1_ff7gbqa,1579654083.0,You're really lucky then! How did you manage to get that kind of schedule?
antiwork,ff0mpks,t1_ff0e4d3,1579470308.0,"Might add an extra hour commute per week? I would never work anywhere that has a commute longer than 30mins each way. Plus 4/8's is actually 2hrs more per week than 5/6's so factor that in. 

When I was still in school from 9-3 I had a half hour commute and was still left with a really nice amount of free time even after factoring in chores and meals"
antiwork,fezvefz,t1_fey0pk5,1579462158.0,"Nah I rather work 5day 6 hours then 4day 8hours but that's just preference. 

Working 6hrs per day would leave me with enough time to do everything I want and feel completely refreshed each day. That along with 2 days off is way better than what we have now with the 40hr work week."
antiwork,fex7qhd,t1_fex6su6,1579426331.0,You're right...
antiwork,fex6cdt,t1_fewukel,1579425248.0,Hell I would even be happy with a five 6hr work week or a four 8hr work week.

PKA,feqkim6,t3_eq4qc0,1579342936.0,No one mentioned that many low income parents have to work multiple jobs to survive which leaves no time for regular tutoring sessions.

AskReddit,feo71ig,t3_eq1wzh,1579295941.0,Winning or being gifted one million dollars so I can live off the interest for the rest of my life.

AskReddit,femd5g6,t3_epp36x,1579249429.0,I would buy a new acoustic guitar. Probably the Taylor 114.

therewasanattempt,fei0g4w,t3_eozxmi,1579127597.0,I would never date a woman with unnatural colored hair. Imo it's not a good look and is a deal breaker.
oddlyspecific,fef7zan,t1_feer4fd,1579050332.0,Actually I rather do something I dislike than spend 8+ hours per day on any of my hobbies. Doing so would ruin the hobby and leave me with less I enjoy that I'm not making a living from.
oddlyspecific,fef7sxh,t1_feerwsp,1579050214.0,Just wait. There will come a day where you will be sick of it.
oddlyspecific,fef7psw,t1_fees9y2,1579050154.0,You're the exception than. I don't need to actually try making a living from my hobbies to know it would ruin them. Hell I can only do something for an hour or two until I'm not enjoying whatever it is anymore and to make a living with any of my hobbies I would need to dedicate a lot more time than an hour per day.
oddlyspecific,fef7eow,t1_feesl8c,1579049945.0,We can only hope that one day most things will be automated and we can all be guaranteed the things we need. That's not happening in my lifetime though.
oddlyspecific,fef796t,t1_feeuve8,1579049842.0,I wouldn't want to. I can't imagine playing guitar or video games for a living. I can only handle doing those things for an hour or two at a time. Writing fiction I could see myself doing but making a living writing novels is almost impossible.
oddlyspecific,feegjti,t1_feebcqi,1579033306.0,Turning your hobby into a career will eventually ruin the hobby for you. Doing something for money is completely different than doing something just for enjoyment.
PKA,feed9r4,t1_fdzipfq,1579031376.0,The last hour was great though. After the guest left.
PKA,feed3xk,t1_fdzj5d7,1579031280.0,I thought he was one of the worst guests in a long time. Audio issues and boring topics made up the first few hours of the show.
PKA,feecvlu,t1_fdz6en8,1579031146.0,Kyle is showing his true self.
aww,fee9ueb,t3_eonffw,1579029373.0,Personally I would never adopt a child but good for them. Also this doesn't really belong in r/aww.
MrRobot,fed27bz,t1_fed1ggw,1578995028.0,"Thanks. So everything that happened was real but it was only one ""reality"" in Elliots mind?"

modernwarfare,fec0is3,t1_fe8u2xz,1578964852.0,That's what WingsofRedemption does these days. He got tired of camping in COD so he decided to play R6 instead.

PKA,fdu8lbr,t1_fdtofrm,1578729459.0,Wait so I'm weird because I got some merch that represents my favorite podcast? What about all the people who buy sports merch? It's not any different.

antiwork,fdffka7,t3_el1k57,1578360525.0,Programming and IT is still better than retail though. I definitely don't want to do that forever.
