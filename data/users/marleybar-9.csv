confession,fepvczi,t3_eqd0t1,1579332638.0,"This is the first thing that comes to mind..it’s my opinion 
“Hurting people hurt people”....I’m not sure how old you are but this is the equivalent of the bully at school taking out  the anger he has, from having to live with abusive parents, on his peers...

This is self sabotage masked as a hard heart seeking to sabotage others...its the cycle of abuse in action....it’s a cry for help...And I say this because if you found nothing wrong with it, you’d find no need to mention it, and go about your business....but you did find a need to talk about it, and that means for one reason or another, subconscious or not, your comparing yourself to others and noticing a difference...a difference that you pretend to like, yet can’t seem to fully accept...hence the post in “confession”...like I said, ultimately it’s a cry for help...
But only you have the power to release yourself...
I hope for your sake you find the path and strength to heal"

Years ago I did some heavy drugs for a period of time...I ended up trying to get sober and found myself diagnosed with something called “drug induced psychosis-schizoaffective bipolar type” (or something like that)....it was the most terrifying time of my life....but finally it went away...now during this time I did go to a doctor and I did take medicine (and it felt like nothing was working) ***please note this- I had many doctors who would over Medicate me as a solution, please do not let them do this to you, change doctors as many times as you need to until you find one who will listen, and not turn you into a zombie*****what helped me SOO MUCH during this time of my life was art...specifically painting...I did art in my free time, art with a therapist, art whenever...it was one of the only things that soothed whatever was going on inside of me....But the thing that helped me the absolute most was reaching out and calling out to God...my lord and savior Jesus Christ...I latched on and sought after him with everything I had...it was all I knew to do...and this is all I know to tell you to do too..."
offmychest,fepsf01,t3_eqclwo,1579329680.0,"I’m not really sure unless you stay very very vague about what’s going on, just expressing your feelings and the effects of living with an abuser...I see that you seem very headstrong about not going to the police or exposing what’s really happening, and I am not trying to necessarily convince you otherwise...you obviously are very smart and resilient....and because of this you might want to ask yourself these questions....why do you feel the need to protect your mother from the choices she has made...and in doing so, are you helping enable her to continue her abuse, not only against you but every other person she is abusing....it’s just a thought🤷‍♀️ I wish I had more wisdom to share with you...I really wish you well and believe you have a bright future ahead of you"

offmychest,fepj0vd,t1_fep9zjv,1579321751.0,"Well you say it’s been “y’all’s life” but can you honestly say that this is “living”?? Bc there is a difference between just breathing/staying alive and actually living...

I just google “signs of emotional abuse” and clicked on “Forms of Emotional and Verbal Abuse You May Be Overlooking” bc Psychology Today   
Here is a paragraph from this article....

“The Personality of an Abuser”

“Abusers typically want to control and dominate. They use verbal abuse to accomplish this. They are self-centered, impatient, unreasonable, insensitive, unforgiving, and they lack empathy and are often jealous, suspicious, and withholding. To maintain control, some abusers ""take hostages,"" meaning that they may try to isolate you from your friends and family. Their moods can shift from fun-loving and romantic to sullen and angry. Some punish with anger, others with silence – or both. It’s usually “their way or the highway.”

^^^based off what you’ve written in your OP, I’d go out on a limb and say you’re being emotionally abused... I’m not a professional but I’m not sure it takes one to see that what you described is not ok...
(If your still really stuck on trying to make something work) I’d say see if she is willing to go to couples counseling with you but if she won’t or doesn’t show significant signs of improvement and/or remorse in a short but reasonable amount of time, you should high tail it out of there quick fast and in a hurry and not look back...(and honestly, from the outside looking in, if I were you I’d skip the couples therapy and move on to high tailing it part...but I realize it’s easier said than done) 
Have you ever thought about reading any self help books?? I’m reading one now about ‘boundaries’  by dr. Henry Cloud and Dr John Townsend.  I don’t know maybe you would be interested in it...or just watching some videos about setting boundaries or even about narcissistic abuse (if your not fully convinced that this is what’s happening)...all I know is that I don’t know you from Adam, but I do know you’re a fellow human being and you deserve a full and happy life simply bc you’re worth it...but only you have the power to make it that way...

and ps-fear is a liar"
offmychest,fep8m91,t3_eqaepz,1579314585.0,From what I hear you’re dealing with a narcissist...no wonder you sound clinically depressed...I’m not telling you what you should do but you should drop her like a hot potato...narcissist only suck out your soul and eat your heart leaving you feeling like a hollow shell...please take care of yourself...you’re worth it and sounds to me you’re only being convinced that you’re not...don’t let the unhappiness of another person destroy YOUR life🤷‍♀️
offmychest,fenq1jw,t3_eq4pzf,1579289197.0,"My advice is to go around and talk with some psychiatrists ask them what their job is really like...what do they really do on a day to day basis, what the pros and cons in their opinion and compare it to what you’re desiring to do...you may find out that it’s not what you thought and you need to go in another direction...you could work at a behavioral health hospital for a summer and see if you are really into dealing with the mentally ill...but over all I think you shoot for for exactly what you want deep in your heart...it’s great if you can find something you really love doing over something you dread everyday...it will be worth it in the long run to put in the extra hours if it’s something you truly desire...you don’t want to look back in ten years and wish you had...bc it will seem even more impossible then (even though nothing is impossible;)). Whatever you choose to do I wish you the best!:) you have one life and what you make of it is ultimately up to you!"
offmychest,fehvkm0,t3_ep86yp,1579124732.0,"My suggestion to you (if you want it) is to go to that place you first think of...that place you see in your head and your thoughts tell you “oh that won’t work out, I’ll never make it there” you know the place you’ve always wanted to go but fear talked you out of...believe in yourself...(but even before all this) I think you should pray...I don’t know how you believe or if you believe at all..but the only one I have ever found to be truly interested in the details of my life is God...the one who created me...I know it sounds cliche but it’s just what I have found to be true...you’re not alone and you shouldn’t have to feel that you are"

drawing,fehu8u2,t3_ep7v89,1579123975.0,I think you’re doing great!! Keep it up and in a year or two compare this to have far you’ve come...you’re definitely talented and you should be proud of yourself 🤓
gardening,fehtkhv,t3_ep7ypz,1579123595.0,I don’t know if this is true or not...but I’ve heard if you put human hair and place it in your garden or around plants you don’t want eaten by deer etc...that it will deter them...they say the next time you get a haircut just gather the hair place it in a stocking and hang in on a little pole around the plants you want guarded...maybe try that...it could deter the rabbits and cause them to move on...or just cause them to check out what you have in your traps instead 🤷‍♀️

offmychest,fehrztg,t3_ep82bg,1579122709.0,....fear is a liar...whatever happened that first caused you to start believing you are “a piece of shit” (and anything that lines up with that statement) you maybe should go back to and break agreements with that lie you choose to believe about yourself...
