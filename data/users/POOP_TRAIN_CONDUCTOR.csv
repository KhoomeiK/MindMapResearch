Guy was convinced after seeing various propaganda on facebook that it was some hilarious left-wing hysteria regardless. 

Utterly pointless. I've shifted my priorities IRL regarding politics elsewhere. Talking people out of their belief in propaganda and debating with bad faith actors is not worth the effort. 

I think the left would do well to create more secular, offline communities to effect change. Similar to how many churches work for the right-wing at the moment.
