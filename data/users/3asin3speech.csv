No, I am saying people should be responsible for their actions.  This is not just about vaccines, but we'll leave it on that subject.

When a person is given a vaccine, they are exposed to a small amount of something so their body builds up resistance to it.  That way, when they get exposed to a larger amount (e.g. through contact with people who are contagious), their body can resist.

It is, effectively, like when you get chicken pox and then typically do not get it again.  By having it as a child, people avoid having it as an adult (when the symptoms are far worse).

During your lifetime, how many people have you known who had mumps or polio?  Terrible illnesses that were nearly eliminated have had a resurgence in recent years.

Imagine a doctor who decided not to wash his hands or use hand sanitizer before operating on others, carrying terrible illnesses from each patient's room to the next.  If everyone started getting sick due to his lacknof hygiene, and your child got very sick, near death, would you support that doctor facing a lawsuit?

Have you [ever heard of Typhoid Mary, the cook who infected 51 people--three of which died?](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Mallon)  This was not done unknowingly; she was a known carrier and kept ignoring the police and court orders.  It's a quick read.

On hilly roads in state forests I did a casual drive for several miles and stayed well over 40 mpg by driving according to economy and not traffic flow.  That was in a tall compact AWD SUV.  The highest I saw was 50 mpg but only for a few miles in a hilly area.

My Forester was all stock.

When I began learning, I drove a 4x4 V6 automatic Tacoma, which averaged 16-18 mpg.  I was able to increase to 21 mpg over several tanks, but it took shifting into Neutral more often than I wanted to in an automatic.

Yes, people can pick a car for hypermiling, and certain cars are better than others, but not everyone can drive an ideal vehicle for hypermiling due to work, family, etc.  There is an active hypermiler who, last I heard, averaged 27 mpg combined from a 1-ton 2wd manual F-350 diesel.  Considering how much fuel a vehicle like that would regularly use, the decrease in emissions and so on is even more significant compared to a compact economy car... and is suitable for those people who need the ability to, say, carry a stack of plywood.

I wouldn't want to support VW after their big diesel scandal and I can't afford the types of repairs that VW/Audi owners I've known have had to incur.  That's a personal preference.

There are surprisingly few vehicle options out there available with a manual transmission that are also suitable for tall people or those who do not prefer compact cars for other reasons.

If efficiency is the only concern, though, I'd say Tesla kinda knocks most of the competition on its backside.

Leathercraft,fbzkix9,t3_ef515y,1577249791.0,That wallet is awesome.  Ignore the asshat and move on.  Sone people will never be satisfied.  Criticizing everything around them distracts their (and others') attention away from discussing their huge flaws.
