Because you're probably not looking to establish a relationship with her beyond getting a letter, she's essentially pushing at the edges of your identity to see if there's any part of you that isn't sure about your decision to have surgery. As someone whose role it is to pretty much do nothing but attest to ""this person definitely wants and needs bottom surgery,"" this is actually kind of her job under most existing medical guidelines, even though it's shitty. This is particularly true if you have some major family mental health issues that you allude to, depending on what those are. (And we can and really should debate whether these antiquated guidelines are necessary all day - I'm personally hugely against them - but she's bound by them in her role.)

All that being said, if she keeps stringing you along for a long period of time, it's extremely reasonable for you to ask if she's gonna write you a letter or not, and if so when, and walk away to someone else if she says no or says that she won't do it for an unreasonable amount of time. You're already at a point where I feel that she should really be writing you a letter very soon or cutting you loose - 5 months just to get a letter is looooong."

That being said, my understanding is that most trans women will not experience any reduction in height due to HRT. Those of us who do can expect to lose maybe 2 inches tops. My understanding of the reason it happens is that as your fat redistributes (including breast growth), your hips rotate somewhat to adjust and carry your new weight distribution better, which in some people can result in the *appearance* of a shorter height due to a new posture (i.e., if you were to measure from joint-to-joint all the way up your body, nothing would actually change - but posture change creates the illusion of shrinkage)."

mypartneristrans,feeruyf,t3_eorxep,1579039873.0,"First of all, this post is really introspective, and you should be proud of that. Not a whole lot of people are willing to look inwardly this intensely when they have a fight with their partner.

Aside from that, five key things jump out at me, some of which are within your control at this point and some which might not be:

1. Yeah, you shouldn't have said what you said to her about the painting. To me, her reaction is completely understandable, for exactly the reasons you said she said. This is one of those places where social nuance can be really hard - if you had phrased what you said even slightly differently (""Of course a trans girl would've wanted this""), this would almost certainly be a non-issue. But the way in which you phrased it was very sexually-suggestive.
2. Number 1 being said, it's clear you weren't coming from a place of bigotry at all. That much is clear. Once she calms down, you might even just want to show her this post - you did a really good job of laying out your perspective on the situation, and you're clearly very caring toward her and toward how your actions are perceived.
3. To answer how you help her more directly, at this point, you should probably just give her some time. You basically called her a pedophile, even though you didn't intend to. You know her best, so wait what you think is an appropriate amount of time for her to relax a bit after a major trigger and then try to make amends at that point. Don't just disappear either, though - if she's still not ready yet, a ""good night; I hope we can talk soon"" text or something like that could be really good to let you know you're thinking about her.
4. You definitely need to explain the painting and its genesis to her, because as you describe how you two left it, it does seem like she has a really misogynist impression of it (which is fair, given what you said). It's clear to me that that's *not* where you were coming from - but she needs to know that.
5. This is unrelated to the issue at hand, but it seems to me like you're really uncomfortable in your relationship. The monogamy dynamic, the sexual dynamic, and even the everyday-assertiveness dynamic all seem to be things that don't work for you. You both need to talk that out and see what solutions you can come up with, once you've patched things up about the painting and fight."
AmItheAsshole,feeckis,t1_fedm9t4,1579030967.0,"I agree that it should be INFO based on the letter of the rules, but inferring from their stated rationale, any more info would be sort of a way to decide between YTA and ESH.

It's also quite possible that they're just describing OP's actions in relation to his sister, since that's the primary conflict that was described in the post (even though there's obviously a larger conflict that precipitated this), and I can't really blame 'em for that - if the sister cared about the purported bully, then what OP did was kind of a dick move and her reaction is understandable and impulsive, even if he never meant for his sister to find out."
ask_transgender,feebzxj,t1_fed380l,1579030633.0,"I completely agree with this. Are there some trolls? Yeah, probably.

But by and large, I think that most of the questions here  that seem off are posed by people who are trans or questioning and really just don't ""get it."" Lots of them still have a good ol' dose of internalized transphobia (almost all of us did at some point!), and many of them have had exactly zero exposure to queer communities before, so the language and decorum that we take for granted is just an unknown to them. That doesn't mean that anyone has ill intent, even if we can sometimes read it that way. This is all probably exacerbated by the reality that we're on Reddit, which as a broader ecosystem (i.e., outside of trans subs and some other specific niches) tends to be frequented by people that a lot of us would probably consider... not super-awesome? And as for the low karma thing, while that's a sign of trolling, it's also just kind of a sign of a trans alt account. I had a trans alt account for a while before I came out; didn't mean I was trolling anyone.

The mods here do a really good job of removing obvious transphobia, and it's just too hard to differentiate more artful trolls from people who have a legitimate question or experience and don't know the ""correct"" way to ask it or share it. Given that, I frankly think that it's sort of our responsibility as members of an ""ask"" sub to take those questions at face value, since that's the entire purpose of the sub - if we want a space where misguided or uninformed questions aren't allowed, there are many other subs that fill that void."

It's not easy by any means, and you're really gonna have to dedicate yourself to it if you want it.

The biggest step you can make toward looking even more feminine, I think, is learning to do some eye makeup. It doesn't need to be anything super flashy, but it'll help! Other changes might be a bit of a waiting game for HRT, and your chin probably won't ever be overtly feminine without FFS (I know! It sucks. I'm in the same boat), but a masculine-leaning chin alone won't clock you.

Well, they were very wrong. Lying certainly does activate your sympathetic nervous response, but so does being stressed in general, being uncomfortable, feeling threatened, being hungry, not having slept enough, and all *sorts* of other things. And some people's sympathetic nervous responses are just low, so polygraphs tend to produce not only false positives but also false negatives way way more than is reasonable."

It's great that you're trying to figure out the best way to go about things in a comfortable way for her here, but communication with *her* is key! Her dypshoria is hers and hers alone, her sexual function is hers and hers alone, and her feelings about you are hers and hers alone.

Also, unless this is the way she's already talked about her genitalia to you or something, two things: (1) making the automatic assumption that she has a penis is dangerous. She may very well not. (2) censoring ""penis"" would be really weird for a lot of trans girls, because it sort of suggests that it's some sort of mystical or unspeakable thing to us. It ain't, and seeing ""p\*\*\*\*"" sure weirds me out a bit! It's a body part like any other, and to me it feels weirdly reminiscent of how lots of cis guys are terrified of the word ""menstruation"" or something. Some girls' experiences might be different and want it to be censored or referred to as something different or whatnot, but in my anecdotal experience, that's far enough away from the norm that it's a better idea to just say ""penis"" and then let her tell you if she wants you to say something different."

But if there's no clear reason? Kids are excellent judges of character, even if they often don't understand the implications of that.

They're extremely perceptive, haven't learned to put up with a lot of bullshit adults have (especially weird staring and touching), and are bad at hiding their feelings. They even have an active genetic interest in discerning whether someone will hurt them, as they're not capable of fighting back and need to avoid danger from the outset. They aren't always right, but it blows my mind that some people don't pay much attention to their kid being legitimately scared of someone for seemingly no reason."

AskReddit,fdi5kth,t1_fdhwche,1578436132.0,"To add another tidbit: the word ""sociopath"" (or any related words like ""sociopathy,"" ""sociopathic,"" etc.) hasn't actually appeared in the DSM since the first edition - and the second edition was published in 1968. And in the first edition, ""sociopathic personality disturbance"" described everything from what we'd now call ASPD to homosexuality, so, not exactly the most rigorous and verified psychiatric diagnosis, even by the standards of the time.

""Psychopath"" (and related words) never actually appeared in the DSM until the most recent fifth edition, where it's a specifier (something that just narrows a diagnosis even further) that can be tacked onto a diagnosis of ASPD. The [ICD](https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/) uses ""psychopath"" a little more extensively and has for a little longer, but ICD codes aren't really used in mental health treatment in the United States.

The two terms are so in the popular consciousness mostly through media, and have never really been widely-used in applied clinical psychology after that brief little thing with ""sociopathic personality disturbance."" Researchers will talk about them a lot and argue about what they mean and if they even exist endlessly, but that's a big part of the reason why they've never really been applied as a matter of actual practice."

Anything that has locations nationally is a good bet here, from Walmart and H&M to higher-end shops. The only problem I envision for you two at a chain store is the employees thinking you're a couple who wants to hook up in their dressing room, if your friend still looks very masculine. This might be especially true if you're walking in with bikinis and stuff. I'm not saying that there's necessarily any romantic or sexual tension between you two, but if there is, keep it away from the dressing rooms and you'll probably be just fine.

Where it can get a little dicey is at small/local/family-owned/etc.-type places. Don't get me wrong, some of these places are gonna be awesome (a local thrift shop in my city is well-known for being hella gay, for example!), but this is where you run more of a risk of getting ""family values""/""religious rights""-type owners, and where you're more likely to run into employees who feel trusted or indispensable enough that they aren't afraid to give you a hard time."

At the time the Bill of Rights was being written, these ""well regulated militias"" were essentially state militaries, in contrast to a unified US military. The analogue today would be each state's National Guard, not the citizenry as a whole (although even that isn't really a perfect parallel, as the National Guard is ultimately a federal entity, even though it operates on a state level.

Trump killed the military leader of a foreign adversary, instantly caused substantial damage to US interests in the region, and may have started a war (not World War 3, mind you - I'm not that alarmist - but a potential war nonetheless).
