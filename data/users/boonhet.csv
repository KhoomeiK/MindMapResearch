Over a phone call? Doubtful. You'd be more likely to get one over Facebook where I'm from. But realistically, email is the general way these things happen. Same for unpaid bills.

A stranded friend would be smart enough to send me an SMS if I don't take the call.

All in all, I almost never get calls from numbers I don't recognize. Half the ones I do get are from countries where I don't know anyone. The other half is ""Hi, would you like to change your service provider?"" or the even better ""Hi, would you like to have your kidneys tested? Buy 3 tests, get the 4th for free!"" and finally, ""Would you like to go sell books in the USA?"" though I only got that one once.

So yeah, I've stopped taking calls from unrecognized numbers unless I'm specifically expecting a call, such as a callback from a company I've applied to."

I've probably opened more Apple products than you, at least laptops. They are actually well thought out. They have some idiotic flaws - but they don't have the ""ez-break"" display case feature around the hinges that Thinkpads used to (hope they've gotten rid of it in the last 4-5 years), nor do they have the ""ez-break"" palmrest  feature of Dell Latitudes, particularly the 7000 series. And they also don't have oddly weak plastic near the rear corners of the palmrest like HP's Probook 430 G1-G2. I've never heard any creaks from an Apple laptop's case. Things aren't just randomly loose even with screws tight like on some other laptops.

Apple's biggest design flaws include not having water drainage a la Thinkpad/Elitebook, as well as some idiotically chosen components for their motherboards, but despite these flaws, at my old job, we repaired at least 6-7 out of every 10 liquid damaged Macbook Air/Pro that didn't power on, while we threw away almost all liquid damaged non-Apple motherboards and just salvaged the LCDs, RAM, SSDs/HDDs and some of the cases and keyboards. Speaking of which, PC laptops are a lot more susceptible to watermarks on the LCD.

I could name the weak points for every Apple laptop made in the last 10 years and there are many, but I always had less problems with repairing them compared to anything but the most basic tasks on Lenovos, HPs and Dells, even the high-end ones. And I straight-up avoided Acer and Asus - filthy machines, especially the lower-end ones.

I once, in a hurry, broke a Lenovo Thinkpad X250 by accidentally damaging the cam cable when I was replacing the keyboard. Which, incidentally, is also the cable for the power button. I'd take a T440(s)/T450(s) keyboard replacement over a Macbook Pro keyboard replacement any time - it's a one minute job. An X240/X250? Nah. Easier on the Mac.
