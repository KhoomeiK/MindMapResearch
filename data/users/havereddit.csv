Many people think they need to keep living in the home — even staying in abusive or high-conflict situations — because they fear they will lose their stake in the home if they leave. “That’s not the case,” says Paris. “If you’re a titled owner to the property, or even if you’re not, you don’t need to physically remain there — it won’t influence how assets are divided.” Dargatz agrees: “You have a claim either because your name is on the title, or as part of [your province’s] matrimonial property act, you have rights whether you live in the home or not.”"
