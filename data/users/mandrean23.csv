MichaelJackson,ffcrq3r,t3_esumvz,1579805892.0,"It‚Äôs too expensive to get good seating. I wish they‚Äôd lower the prices since the flight to NY plus hotel would be around $500, plus two tickets? It‚Äôs not friendly to those who don‚Äôt have that kind of money to spend."
Onision,ffbcyjt,t1_ffbc424,1579760122.0,Ma‚Äôam this is a Wendy‚Äôs
Onision,ffao9qs,t3_esiqrc,1579740618.0,I knew Chris would come in clutch
Onision,ff6357f,t3_eql7c0,1579617953.0,"It‚Äôs because he‚Äôs not a feminist, he truly believes women are inferior and only exist to be used by him. Many of these so called ‚Äúmale feminists‚Äù label themselves as this to get laid or seem self-righteous. Notice how he‚Äôs all about LGBT rights and being vegetarian. It‚Äôs all bullshit to make himself seem better and in the know, but in reality he doesn‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs all for YouTube."
Onision,fen4bec,t3_eput6z,1579276667.0,"Seems like she now wants to be a victim too because Onision‚Äôs career is over and he and Kai are going to face criminal prospecution. I don‚Äôt trust Madison at all. How can you be friends with onision after he did what he did to Shiloh? Why are you trying to publicly humiliate Shiloh and make it seem like she‚Äôs a bully and wrong? Shiloh absolutely said the right thing. No one took her seriously and Onisions lynch mob drove her out of the internet. She told Madison that it would happen to her and she should not speak up. That‚Äôs very reasonable to do, she wanted to keep Madison from having experienced what she went through. Yet Madison is trying to be the victim now, despite being friends with Mr. and Mrs. pervert while they were grooming Sarah. Thanks but no thanks, she should stay out of it."
todayilearned,femndd6,t1_fem2xq3,1579263586.0,It‚Äôs what‚Äôs trendy now
SkincareAddiction,felbuf8,t3_ep7qa8,1579218519.0,I stopped using this gel cream that was causing CC on my cheeks. I‚Äôve also used adapalene 0.3% and it‚Äôs helped immensely. My doctor prescribed a sulfur cleanser that I should use once a week to not irritate my skin. Overall I try to keep my routine very minimum so I don‚Äôt break out.
SkincareAddiction,felb9cv,t3_epr8e7,1579218132.0,That looks more like a rash than acne. I recommend going to a dermatologist or your PCP to see what‚Äôs going on.
MichaelJackson,fejum6n,t3_epdiqx,1579186219.0,"I think we can all agree Michael always matched his music to the latest trends but made it his own. 
Off the Wall: groovy and funky, 70‚Äôs type of music
Thriller: still groovy but involving a lot of 80‚Äôs elements 
Bad: extremely 80‚Äôs 
Dangerous: extremely 90‚Äôs but now just being more direct in his lyrics on his thoughts on the world
HIStory: way less 90‚Äôs, more experimental and honest, cares way less about whether it will be pop enough for the mainstream
BOTDF: same thing, very creative
Invincible: early 2000‚Äôs to the max, technological elements which I really liked. Very few songs that were somewhat groovy."
MichaelJackson,feibv2s,t1_fei54q1,1579134868.0,I read up on this and the Eagles moved up because the number of sales now includes streams. I‚Äôm not sure why Michael‚Äôs streams aren‚Äôt included too.
MichaelJackson,fei4b5w,t3_ep54gq,1579129978.0,I thought the Eagles were #1?

college,fdfu6b8,t3_ekvg3o,1578370308.0,"I'm not an engineering major but know a few people who are and they make A's-B's usually. One thing I've seen them do is the assigned reading, from start to finish, and then reading a little extra. Another thing I've seen them do is do word problems from the end of each chapter. They don't do one or two, they do 15 or 20. And finally, I see that they are genuinely interested in what they're studying and it isn't a chore to them."
college,fdftf4p,t1_fddwuas,1578369750.0,I relate to your struggle. I recently made straight A's at a local college but at my previous university I made C/B- averages. It's very frustrating.
college,fdfta52,t3_ektstk,1578369651.0,My expectations were not met and I am scrambling to transfer out.

MichaelJackson,fd5d15g,t3_ejl2ha,1578176407.0,"Sad that this is the only way that they are relevant in the public sphere. They offer nothing to the world but a documentary saying the most romanticized, gross things on camera. No skills, nothing that they contribute to pop music or any other fields. If the estate did not have money, I can guarantee you they would not be suing them."
MichaelJackson,fd5cbv5,t3_ek1fqb,1578176200.0,"Troll, don't even entertain them"
MichaelJackson,fd5c16o,t1_fd3gm4l,1578176102.0,"You're probably talking about my comment. I am going to be very honest with you. Majority of us here have done the research and come to the conclusion that Michael is innocent. Mesereau, an excellent and intelligent lawyer, does not make Michael guilty or innocent. It is the evidence and logical analysis of the allegations that make Michael innocent. The estate needs to be intelligent this time around and having the counsel of someone like Mesereau is to their benefit and honestly to the benefit of Michael's legacy. The money coming from the estate is primarily going to Michael's children, who even the MJ-guilty party agrees have nothing to do with the child molestation scandals. Morally, I do not like Mesereau. From a strategic sense, I think he should be at least giving the estate guidance, because he is clearly smarter than all of them. I do not like John Branca and if the man he is representing himself said that he did not trust Branca, it means he should not be working in any capacity with Michael's estate. These are my two cents."
MichaelJackson,fd5afrb,t3_ejy759,1578175704.0,Finally the estate is smart and is making a good decision. I have issues with Mesereau morally but he is a really good lawyer.

Conservative,fcgg9ey,t3_eh067c,1577639654.0,"Lol dude create a Fortune 500 company or be a trust fund baby and maybe you‚Äôll get to live the life of luxury. Life is hard and you need to get a good paying job after college. I know of this family who doesn‚Äôt work, and lives off of the government. When prompted to work, they make excuses. They are the ones who would love to have a socialist society. Hell they are living free on the taxpayer‚Äôs dime. I respect the single mothers who are working and getting a degree and need some help feeding their children. Or the elderly who don‚Äôt work anymore. But the people who aren‚Äôt making smart choices and abusing the government? Idk, it just bothers me a lot."

college,fc7g4i8,t3_eg01in,1577506406.0,"Grades matter. For the most part, no, people don't notice the ""smart"" kids. Unless you're going to Stanford or MIT where there's the 15 year-old genius who graduated early lol. But usually, the smart kids are struggling to stay afloat and dealing with ego death since college is seldom like high school."
college,fc7g0jg,t3_efxvyu,1577506310.0,"I'd say it depends. I know in my state there are mandatory classes everyone is supposed to take. But at my former college, there were distribution requirements that stated you had to take a class in specific general academic areas (quantitative reasoning, history, etc.) and the mandatory freshman writing course that should be taken either in the fall or spring."
college,fc7fnap,t3_eg0g8p,1577505992.0,"Look up any important deadlines pertaining to leaves of absences first, email your dean or academic advisor second, and do not lose hope at all (third). I took a leave because my situation was not helping me succeed at all. As a result, I dropped two classes my fall semester sophomore year and made C's in those same classes in the spring. I was about to drop out of school and never look back. I recommend taking a leave if you are in a difficult situation. It's best to save your money, time, and energy than scramble to try to balance your situation with college."

college,fc7e6nd,t1_fc57i0o,1577504776.0,"I have a question. What if in your first year you do okay, but in your second year you do poorly? (Dropping classes and making C's in major science courses) I ask because I had a bad sophomore year and am still wondering if STEM is for me. Granted I made a B in my statistics class (I really liked the subject). I did have a rough sophomore year due to a lot of personal issues. What are your thoughts on my given situation?"
MichaelJackson,fc7apo9,t3_egdr7c,1577502029.0,Clearly I was born to the wrong family lmao WHAT
Onision,fc6cava,t3_egcriu,1577477229.0,"I did when I was like 14, I thought he told the truth and didn‚Äôt bs anything. I was going through normal teenage angst so i resonated with his thoughts on self-harm and suicide. But after a while I got tired of his form  of comedy so I unsubscribed. I remember seeing the Billie drama but not paying much mind to it because I was not an onion fan anymore. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I started becoming interested in this situation when I saw Shiloh speaking up and telling her story. I‚Äôll never forget the video of Shiloh freaking out and thinking poor onion boy he has to deal with a ‚Äúcrazy person.‚Äù Now being older and knowing the full story, and having experienced being with someone who drove me crazy at a young age, I‚Äôm pissed at myself for being so immature. At the same time, I‚Äôm appalled at how vulnerable I was and if I had actual contact with him I would‚Äôve become another victim. I wish I could apologize to Shiloh for what I thought of her."
