They know how to check if it's loaded, know if the safety is on or off and they know how to hit a target. The problem is people who get guns and maybe shoot a couple of rounds at a gun range when they get it then treat it like a scary, mysterious object that makes it exciting to children. Learning proper gun safety and understanding the functions and workings of a gun makes them much less dangerous and much less likely to hurt or kill them selves or others.
