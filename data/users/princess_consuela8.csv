Just remember that after 6 months of graduating or your study permit expiring (whichever comes first) you lose the ability to apply for the PGWP.

mcgill,femsz2j,t3_epto3h,1579268732.0,"Math 141 that first midterm I got a 53. Legit the worst grade I’ve ever received in my life and I had a bit of a breakdown thinking I’m just an idiot and can’t do math. But then I literally did every single question in every section of the textbook that we cover. I did many of the questions multiple times, repeating the difficult topics frequently. With this class (and most of math and physics I realized) it’s ALL about practice practice practice. I’ve always been more of a conceptual learner but here you have to just drill those questions and repeat. The biggest thing is to make sure you prioritize on the last and middle questions for each of the sections because the first questions are generally easier, and the middle to last questions for each section will prepare you better for the exam. 

I practiced so so much and I got a 97 on the final and ended with an A so there is always hope. Literally from a 53 —> 97 from pure practice. It’s just about getting through as many of those questions as possible and repeating the harder ones. Also a great resource was this website where people had detailed answers to every question in the Stewart Calc textbook. I forgot the name of the site but you should be able to find it with a google search. Good luck and I know you can do it!!"

I feel like that’s likely to end in rejection not because of the penis size but because it might come across poorly to bring up sex when you barely know someone.. if I was the guy and that happened to me I might be quick to assume things didn’t work out because of the micro penis when instead she was just turned off at me being so forward. 

Personally as a woman I don’t see it as a big deal, I think it’s insanely stigmatized. Ask any lesbian whether or not you need a penis to be satisfied, I would even argue that you can please a woman wayy more without one 🤷‍♀️ fingers, tongue, strap ons.. the possibilities are endless and people are way too quick to be closed minded and judgemental. That being said I would be kinda turned off if anyone I was seeing brought up their penis on the first date because I would feel like they were more interested in a fuck buddy as opposed to a real connection."

AmItheAsshole,fdxt5os,t1_fdxntwc,1578772635.0,"The punishment in question here is whether she should be allowed to go to parties and to her prom. I don’t think that’s a punishment designed for children and is completely appropriate for someone her age (a teenager, who lets face it, is nowhere near being an adult), and completely within their rights as parents to enforce since she is 

A) Living under their roof, and not practicing autonomy in any other aspect of her life since she is fully dependent on her parents for food, warmth, security, money, pretty much all her basic needs (AKA not an adult, pretty much the definition of a kid)

B) Expecting her parents to pay for college where I’m assuming they will also be facilitating all of her basic needs by providing for her 

If she was fully independent of her parents, which is more representative of being an adult than just being over 18, then this would be completely irrelevant as they wouldn’t even be able to enforce any punishment on her, since she would be living on her own and taking care of herself."

If you care about your kids you will do whatever you can to make sure they have healthy habits and are good people. Sometimes that means being the bad guy in their eyes. Sometimes that means putting in the effort to correct them instead of burying your head in the sand under the guise of rEsPeCtiNg tHeiR aUtoNomY

AmItheAsshole,fdweepv,t1_fdwavt0,1578757848.0,"Doing something for the “warm and fuzzies” or because you yourself want to contribute to a productive society would require having intrinsic motivation to do so. 

Providing people with extrinsic motivators like monetary rewards or a special events will not change whether or not they have an intrinsic desire to help others, display empathy or contribute to society. Allowing her to go to prom, or giving her any other incentive for that matter is not going to teach her those things. I agree that the punishment itself won’t teach her that either (since human behaviour is not solely governed by operant conditioning, which is what separates us from animals), but it will teach her that what she did carries weight and can’t just be brushed under the rug. 

When someone is forced to face consequences for their actions, they tend to re-evaluate the behaviours that caused those actions. Her parents will need to use that time of introspection to teach her how to be better and re-establish what it means to be a good person. The best chance she has at changing her behaviours in the long term is if she herself develops the intrinsic motivation to be that person."

How can we teach our youth that the only time they should be doing something is when they can get a reward/incentive from it? People shouldn’t need to be incentivized to be decent human beings with basic morals. 

“People will not do anything if they don’t have incentives” - In my experiences with decent human beings I have not at all found this to be true. I’ve met many people who go out of their way to help someone even when they’re not getting something in return, it’s called being a productive member of society and not a self-serving prick (not saying that’s what you are, but if everyone thought that way then that’s what we would get)"
AmItheAsshole,fdw5r3b,t1_fdvw48d,1578755357.0,"She shouldn’t be wanting to change her behaviour just because she thinks if she acts nice nice then her parents will let her go to prom. She should be changing her behaviour because she understands that what she did was WRONG and she should WANT to be better for the sake of not being a shitty human being. 

Any manipulative teenage girl can pretend to be well behaved for a few months if she knows she will get what she wants from it. But what about after prom? She’s just going to go back to her previous behaviour 

The parents need to focus on how they can make her learn that lesson and see that what she did was wrong and that she needs to change. I feel like she’s more likely to see that what she did was wrong if shes forced to live with consequences of her shitty actions."

Mcat,fdkpjcl,t1_fdknsa1,1578508469.0,"I don’t think this makes sense just for the reason that when we double both the weak acid and it’s conjugate, buffering capacity doubles even though the pH stays the same. So while there is a pH at which the bufffer has optimal buffering capacity, the buffering capacity is not solely related to the pH of the solution. The capacity is related the amount of buffer present, since the buffers ability to resist changes in pH is through depletion of the buffer so more buffer = can resist more changes in pH.

Also the reason that the optimal buffering capacity of a buffer is when pH = pKa, I don’t think it’s because of the pH but rather that when pH = pKa, [conjugate base]/[weak acid] = 1 (making its log = 0 so the pH = pKa). So it’s saying that the optimal capacity is when we have equal amounts of weak acid and it’s conjugate so I would think that the optimal capacity is not necessarily due to the pH but rather the relative concentrations of the weak acid and it’s conjugate"
Mcat,fdkog6h,t1_fdkntaf,1578507818.0,"That’s what I think of when I try to picture this. The buffering capacity is the buffers ability to resist changes in pH, and it’s ability to resist changes is by depleting the buffer, so the more buffer you have, the more buffering capacity since there is more buffer that can be depleted when resisting those changes. That’s why capacity doubles when you double both the weak acid and it’s conjugate. But in this case if we increase one and decrease the other, it will necessarily cause a shift in the equilibrium to re-establish equilibrium. I feel like the buffering capacity wouldn’t change since we added more weak acid but this has to react to form the conjugate base that we depleted via le chateliers principle and the amount reacting would be to make up for the conjugate base we depleted.. so it seems like in total we would have the same amount of buffer?"

Mcat,fcy0cjz,t3_ejib48,1578072924.0,"Don’t need to know the equation just understand the concept. Hydrostatic pressure will draw fluid out of the vessels, while oncotic pressure draws fluid back in. Basically on the arterial side the hydrostatic pressure is higher than osmotic (oncotic) pressure due to the elastic recoil of the muscular arterioles, and that hydrostatic pressure forces fluid out into the interstitium. As fluid leaves, the hydrostatic pressure drops while oncotic pressure stays the same since proteins can’t leave the vessels, so by the time we get past the capillaries to the venule side the hydrostatic pressure has dropped to a point below oncotic pressure, which draws fluid back into the venules. 

The net fluid out is slightly more than the fluid sucked back in at the venule side, but any excess will eventually be drained by the lymphatic system and re-enter systemic circulation via the thoracic duct"

Also, throughout both seasons Joe has ALWAYS strongly believed that he was the good guy and looking out for people who needed protecting, I think with the only exception being when he was forced to kill Beck, which triggered that internal conflict in him this season to be better than before. But nonetheless he definitely doesn’t see himself as a villain, just someone who had their hand forced in a few situations that got out of hand, with the exception of murdering Beck (I think that was actually the only time he thought that he might not be the good guy) 

For him, the person he fell in love with is not who Love actually was and now that has been revealed to him, so of course he wouldn’t still love her, she’s literally a completely different person than who he thought she was. I think people expect him to accept her because they see Love and Joe as one in the same, but you have to remember that this is not how Joe seems himself and Joe was in love with the idea of a good, perfect girl, which he now knows Love is not"

I think that the ending could signify a turning point for Joe, maybe we will see a more ruthless side to him as he starts to accept who he truly is and give in to his inner darkness, instead of keeping his “dark knight in shining armour” persona"
