AskBibleScholars,ff38k2d,t3_erbo2c,1579536230.0,Just for clarity: you mean the human Jesus of Nazareth was unaware of his divinity? As opposed to the eternal Son?

I’m in the process of moving and all of my references are in storage.

Edit: And no matter if you ascribe Mark an early or late writing, 70 CE would definitely have happened during the lifetime of most of Mark’s earliest readers."

movies,fdzwdke,t1_fdzvjso,1578797395.0,The fact that Scarecrow is the only character to have appeared in all three films besides the central characters bothered the hell out of me for some reason.
movies,fdzqog1,t1_fdz4d51,1578793584.0,Yes. Exactly.

AskBibleScholars,fdzby0m,t1_fdwzig9,1578788593.0,"Yeah, that’s really an issue where scholars are either on one side of the fence or the other. So I’d read Answers in Genesis and their publications to get a sense of the ‘literal’ perspective (not sure about other resources, but Answers would likely recommend some literature) and then I’d look at something like Theistic Evolution. I think I remember Robert Alter’s translation of Genesis (especially its footnotes and introductory material) being helpful for me in this regard from a language perspective (i.e. how does the language used inform the purpose of the text?), although I don’t have it in front of me to confirm its usefulness."

Hang in there. I know it’s scary knowing your kid is going under the knife, but it’s a fairly straightforward and minimally invasive surgery."
