They’re very intelligent and loyal dogs. However, they’re extremely energetic and really need a lot of space to run around and it always helps to have other dogs so they have another dog to endlessly harass.

Edit: since I’m being downvoted: I—just as the rest of the world—don’t really know if clipping ears and docking tails has lasting effects on a dogs psyche. However, I can tell you with absolute certainty  that I don’t remember when the doctor flayed a section of my dick off for religious/traditional reasons I don’t believe in, and It hasn’t had any negative effects on my life. So I guess what I’m trying to say is, some people view it on the same level as female genital mutilation, while I see it more on the level of circumcision for religious/cultural/aesthetic/health reasons. Whatever, to each his own. Fitz is my families third Doberman; they all live/lived healthy, happy lives with more than 5 acres of space and plenty of brothers and sisters and their ears and tails being cut very obviously had negligible effects on their dog psyches.

Edit: I feel like I should have added a /s to the genital mutilation part.
