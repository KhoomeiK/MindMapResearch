You might try mocking it up with a bit of cardboard and drive around. Start by covering the sensor and seeing what happens, then mock up where the bumper is"

ToyotaTacoma,fc7bf9c,t3_egi9o9,1577502584.0,"I had the 6spd 2nd gen with the v6 as my daily and absolutely loved it. Gearing was almost perfect, though first gear was just a little shorter than I would prefer it. The only downside I personally had to deal with was the $1600 clutch job at 65k... I bought it at 60k. That was a difficult pill to swallow. There were other indications that the first owner abused the truck, but that was the most expensive one. 

I towed about 5k lbs from Baltimore to Kansas city, stable as a rock, even when it snowed in the mountains of Pennsylvania . Snapped into 4 hi and it really proved itself as a capable little truck.

I now own a 2019 off road with the automatic transmission. Not nearly as fun. It is slow to respond and it shifts too early with the ECT off. They definitely designed it to maximize economy. My solution currently is to just keep the ECT on, but I will definitely be regearing in the future. On the plus side, the wife can drive it too, so that's nice.

If you're on the fence, I'd recommend going for the manual. It's just more fun, in my opinion. Kinda wish I'd gone manual for this latest truck, but it'll be a baby carrier soon enough and I honestly need my wife to be able to drive it too.

Happy shopping!"
