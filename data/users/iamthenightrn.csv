If it is anyone's responsibility to care for anyone, why the fuck have your parents basically disaster foisted off their parenting to their youngest kid?

You are not get mother. You're not her father. You're not her servant. Not her maid. Not her child. Not her slave. 

You're get sister. And you've done more than when her own parents were willing to do for her.

Think about that and let that sink in for a minute. 

You've done more than get own parents were willing to do for her.

You deserve your own life too.

She's used to having someone look after her and you've been enabling that, she needs to get used to looking after herself now that she's fully capable of it, because frankly, it was never your responsibility to begin with.

Your dad and your sister can fuck off. If Daddy is so mad, HE can look after her like a REAL FATHER should have been doing all along."
