icecoast,ffqj05b,t1_ffqhyol,1580135929.0,"Ellen is really nice imo because it gets less tourists, so its way less crowded. I haven't tried Lower FIS, but I tried Encore (I think) as a boarder and thought to myself at the beginning ""this doesn't seem too bad"" and ended up hating myself about halfway down  because the bumps were the size of me haha. I also definitely understand your point about the grouchy patrollers, there was one that just sat by a ""trails merging"" sign yelling at everyone to slow down lol"
Fitness,ffp5o2o,t3_eu4y2w,1580086870.0,How do I treat inner elbow pain/stiffness after a workout? I recently got back to the gym and I guess I pushed myself too hard and did too many curls. Now 2 days later suddenly my inner elbows are incredibly stiff and hurt to extend.

icecoast,ffo29v1,t1_ffllswn,1580073440.0,"Went to Ellen today, had the time of my life. I love how it has a small local feel even though it is a big mountain, and it snowed all day :)"
icecoast,ffls2h0,t1_ffke7f5,1580043356.0,Might go to Ellen today just to avoid the crowds. Sucks that the lift between the two is closed otherwise I wouldn't have to choose between them

trees,ff6c7ul,t1_ff6bsca,1579624019.0,"I might have to take a trip over to Bolton for night skiing sometime! We used to do $60 season passes to Smugs through school, but this year (my freshman year) they decided to change it to Sugarbush/Mad River. That's so cool that your friend got to ski for free, I'm so jealous haha"
trees,ff6asyf,t1_ff6ahd3,1579623118.0,"Colchester is massive haha, I'm over at St Mikes. I go by Champlain College all the time when I go to Church St! Any recommendations for stuff to do for fun around here? I've been spending a lot of time at Sugarbush but I gotta find something to do around here when I'm not snowboarding lol"
trees,ff69xca,t1_ff69r5g,1579622551.0,Vermont is amazing!! Everyone is really nice and the views are amazing. I am very familiar with Essex since I am in Colchester!
trees,ff67xo6,t1_ff67e3m,1579621259.0,"Living in Vermont right now for school. Usually we walk through the woods at night and smoke and I shiver uncontrollably, but it makes it feel amazing once you get back inside where it is warm!"

college,ff56r00,t1_ff55fob,1579581836.0,"I'm definitely gonna invite them out, even something as little as asking if they wanna come to the store with me lol. I'm glad your roommate situation worked out :)"
college,ff51f2r,t1_ff4wa7p,1579577632.0,I might do that

college,ff51bd4,t1_ff4xdke,1579577552.0,"I've sorta gotten to know one of them since he is close with one of my friends, but he's never here since he's on the basketball team. Its nice that he always goes out of his way to say hi to me though. I'm definitely just gonna go plop myself in the common area sometime to do homework or something lol"

snowboardingnoobs,ff4wou1,t3_ergyvg,1579574252.0,"I just started hitting jumps and I've realized you just need to send it and don't worry about falling. Falling is a part of snowboarding and its gonna happen regardless, if you're not falling once in a while you're not shredding hard enough :)"
malehairadvice,ff4we1f,t3_erigqo,1579574046.0,Clean up the neck line and the cheek lines a little. There's some videos on Youtube on how to do that and makes a big difference.
