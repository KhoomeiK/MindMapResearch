AskReddit,fdy9a4g,t3_enb981,1578777360.0,"the moment I realized that my siblings where the reason why I feel so miserable,
I used to hit my brothers to shut them up when they are being intentionally annoying or obnoxiously loud, they ask for it so much, but when I hit them, my parents used to punish me for it and tell me that “if they are annoying you just ask them to stop once, if they don’t then just tell us” and when I did go to them for help, they just had that stupid look on their face like they don’t feel like taking care of the problem, when I stormed out of the room, I lashed out on them and got in trouble once-more, lesson learned: don’t say it unless you mean it
 
I realize that it’s not that it’s not my fault and that I went to them for help and they didn’t come through, I have anger problems and I ask for help with that too, but they still, like usual, don’t help me, so I just learn to love myself because it’s not my fault I’m in trouble, This cycle still continues, and my parents continue to lay on their butts until someone gets hurt"
