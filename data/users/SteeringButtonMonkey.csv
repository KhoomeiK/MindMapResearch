No rule changes except ""You have to have a radically different looking car"" will bring those days back...look at WEC...They had pretty open aero rules and stil everyone converged to one basic design...

They had radically different designs back then because they didnt have the technology from today...They strapped wings on their cars and hoped it will work...Nowadays with CFD and windtunnels the cars will converge anyways...

Thats really sad if something like that gets banned sooner...FRIC suspension wasnt a loophole just got banned, because expensive...Monkey seat got banned after a loooong time...Had nothing to do with it coming from a loophole...

Second hurdle are major fines that even get personal, so one punishment is for example banning the team principal from F1 for life...

And the third hurdle are the pretty strict rules...There is not much to develop outside of the main team that you can then easily integrate into the car, like exotic material etc...the main performance differntiatior is still the aero and you can only design aero in full and no one will be able to design a frontwing seperatly from the car...
