2) Failure to pay child support

Things for which you cannot be imprisoned for:

1) Unpaid student loans

The complication is if you get sued on account of having debt, and failure to appear in court or pay the results of a suit could theoretically end in incarceration, but that is extremely unlikely. Hence why I say ""mostly false.""

Individuals can be imprisoned for failing to pay court fees, but this is an uncommon and controversial practice in the US. But ""debtors' prisons"" have not been a thing since the 19th century.

CatholicMemes,fc5enye,t1_fc5dbsl,1577455351.0,"Heresy is denial of a core doctrine of the faith, so for Catholics that especially would be denial of dogma. 

So heresy would be like denying the divinity of Christ, or (for Catholics) the Assumption of Mary into Heaven. 

In the case of murder, if you were to say that Jesus ""loves and endorses killing,"" that would absolutely be heresy. If you argued like St. Augustine that killing, while always tragic, may sometimes be necessary, you are definitely ok. 

But also some dude robbing a liquor store and killing a clerk is absolutely committing a grievous sin, he's not committing heresy unless he tried to justify it using Christianity for some reason. See the difference?

""Thou shalt not kill"" is an important commandment, yet the ancient Israelites who subscribed to that commandment it regularly killed, in warfare and in their society (it's worth noting that direct commands demanding killing are throughout Leviticus). 

You say that heresy is contrary to Orthodox Christian doctrine, yet every major branch of the Christian faith (Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestants) have historically allowed for taking life, and even now explicitly allow it in specific circumstances. Each of these branches have solid reasons for allowing this (based on scripture and two millenia of theology). 

So again, I am not going to defend the Inquisition on a contemporary Christian understanding of moral theology, but sanctioned-killing was actually a very small part of what the Inquisition did. And torture, while obviously morally despicable, is something far less biblically and theologically complicated.

It's really not that simple. If the Inquistion was wrong, it was for reasons other than it being heretical."
