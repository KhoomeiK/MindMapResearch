I’m really enjoying Hero Wars, and have spent a decent amount on that recently as they tend to give a lot better value then MSF.  They give more gems for $100 then MSF gives cores, and Hero Wars occasionally has x4 events (one for a few more hours now) where they give 4x the gems for the same $100.  Been waiting for MSF to do that and they NEVER do.  Their deals involve bundling stuff you don’t want with stuff you do, instead of giving you more of the stuff you want.

I imagine more would buy the MSF $100 core offers if they occasionally offered 36k cores instead of 8.5k cores."
