And given what is there and great, there's just something about the DS Era soundfonts that made them crisp, clear, and sharp yet still realistic without over-mellowing or ""noise-ifying"" like some of Gen 8 soundtracks do.

A modern Pokemon really should be much more developed, open (not necessarily open world), complex, and varied.

That's did not bode well with me at all, what a rude thing to say.
