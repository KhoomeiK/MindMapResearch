Oh thank you :)"

Anxiety,fegaz1v,t1_fef0611,1579085600.0,"I really get what you mean ! Can't count the fake tumors I had too..  

Thank you for that, I didn't know I needed to hear that, but your words made me feel better, cause I never really thought about it like that. It was really starting to make me feel shitty and you gave me another perspective. 
I really hope you feel better now too"
Anxiety,fedradv,t3_eogyxz,1579018194.0,"Feels like this post was for me ! 
Its getting worse and worse with the year and it feels like I can't control it. 
Currently I m fighting against myself to stop thinking I have trigeminal neuralgia, when it's probably only a tooth decay. Good moments, loving it"
notliketheothergirls,fe5kft2,t1_fe59gnh,1578870544.0,"To me it's also because in these comics they hate each other, don't accept their differences, so making them love themselves is showing that they embrace and love their differences"
confessions,fe2ibrz,t3_enihhk,1578838648.0,"When people who are thinking about killing themselves decide it's time,  there is nothing you can do, and most of the time there is no way anyone could have guessed it was about to happen, cause they kinda look happier and relieved. 
I'm sorry that happened to you, it's a really huge burden to carry, but you are not responsible. You seemed to be a good friend for him. 
I hope you still have someone with who you can talk about all of this"
offmychest,fdzv4mq,t1_fdzsgbj,1578796523.0,"I think I was just lucky before. I knew loads of people who had to deal with theft and violence, but I guess it never happened to me, or it did but not so many time in a such a short amount of time.   And its getting worse for sure, like everywhere else probably"
offmychest,fdzrxzo,t1_fdzrfod,1578794384.0,"I live in France. It's not actually like the worst city in France, far from it. it's bad as any other could be in some aspects but not that bad, thats what bothers me so much,it still keeps happening over and over again, to me, to my friends, and it feels from what I hear like it's everywhere the same, like you can't escape that,and everytime you buy something it could be stolen no matter how much you try to prevent it, if you get out anything could happen to you. I heard so many bad stories from eveeyone (with violence sometimes) over the past year... And I just can't accept the fact that ""it's like that, take precautions, anything could happen"""
Rabbits,fdrefc0,t1_fdqgqu8,1578683359.0,"The owner can't take care of him so put him outside to die ? Great. Just came in the comments to say thank you so much for doing what you did, even if that rabbit wasn't yours. I hope he will find a family soon :)"
Zoomies,fdrcwcv,t1_fdq33d7,1578682664.0,"I think everyone thinks that before having one ! I used to think that too and then I discovered that they can have suuuuuch a temper. 
Mine run/ jumps for no reason, he comes to get me, sit in front of me looking at me until I stand up to pick him up, and he starts running like crazy to avoid me, and when I go back to sit, he comes back in front of me like ""run after me you lazy ass""
Rabbits are like quiet cats (not always quiet though, mine makes weird noises and like boxing  )"
Anxiety,fdq0hnd,t1_fdpzzv3,1578648772.0,"You are welcome. 
I like that sentence that says that you have to do your best everyday, but also accept that sometimes your best is juste waking up, eating/taking a shower, and that's ok. Everyone is different, we have to accept and make peace with it, it gets easier when you understand and respect your own rythm. 
If you need it today, or any other day, I'm sending you all the positive thoughts I have."
Anxiety,fdq0930,t1_fdpq7iq,1578648444.0,"God, I'm so sorry you went through that. That was really brave of you. Congratulations for being sober. 
That's perfectly normal it's gonna take time. It's important to remember that you just have to do the best you can everyday, and sometimes your best is just waking up, eating, and that's all, and that's perfectly ok, you are slowly recharging.
What's important is understanding/ listening to what we really need and respect it, no matter what other people think of tell you, because you are the only one who's gonna live in your shoes and go through your day. 
Congratulations again, I wish you and your daughter the best. :)"

AmItheAsshole,fdp1qf7,t3_emfohb,1578617923.0,"NTA. This is a terrible way to act, he is 35 but acting. Like a 15 years old. 
 Is he like that often ? Because that's really a huge lack of respect, and him telling you that you don't matter, are not famous enough... And trying to put you in a bad position kinda seems like there is more to it than just a ""joke"". 
Anyway you did the right thing"

TwoXChromosomes,fdp05vu,t3_emf9fe,1578616871.0,"You were helping your dog, even if your boobs can be seen (and really, can they ? Is it in a bra ? And if not can we reeeeeally see them ? ) People are not supposed to look at them. This is in no way sexual. You are living your life, and during the process of living stuffs happen, you can't give up. 
Cause it seems from your post like it's not a one time thing, and it's actually really affecting you. 
He has no right to explain to you what to wear/ what to do to reassure him. 
If you give up it's somehow (involuntarily) validating the whole behaviour. And after that he will always find something else ... These kind of things only escalate sadly, because it's not rational in the first place... 
I'm so sorry youre going through that. Did you consider couple therapy ? 
Anyway, no matter what happens, I wish you the best..."
relationship_advice,fdoyxir,t3_embdb0,1578616062.0,"Do not stay with her because you are scared. 
Look, I understand, your while world is crashing, you might lose a family, the love of your life... I am terribly this is happening to you. 
But you can't stay with someone by fear of not finding someone else, cause it wouldn't be a good relationship. Stay with her if you think the trust can be rebuild, if she seems sincere, if you think it is worth the work, if you can go to couple therapy .. 
If not then leave. By staying with her you would miss every girl you could have fall in love with, you d be miserable, never trusting her again, feeling bad at every family reunion, always with doubts, with time it would only get worse, and your fear of being alone too, the resentments between each other would grow bad.... 
You deserve, as everyone else, better than a relationship like this. 
I feel you but if you found her you can find someone else, better, who won't cheat on you and finding really ridiculous reason to justify it. 
That fear is perfectly normal. 
You have to take a long time and decide what you want, but no matter the income, don't take a decision with fear, cause they are always bad. 
I wish you all the best"

Anxiety,fdo9pvn,t1_fdo6kl1,1578601317.0,"I use that metaphor too ! Or something similar, with something looking kinda like a battery. I see myself needing to be charged again after a huge social event and try to accept that I need to be alone and in a safe and relaxed place, and that's it's perfectly ok.
But I like your metaphor better!"

FreeCompliments,fdhkvp8,t3_eleifs,1578424804.0,"Having a good self esteem is really tough, but you need to learn how to love yourself, slowly, piece by piece. Its mostly accepting who you are, cause all the bad things you think about yourself are only hurting you, and only you. 
You are beautiful and your smile says a lot about the lovely and funny person you seem to be !"

confessions,fdf2agy,t3_ekzrqr,1578351678.0,"You are not a terrible person. You found yourself in a situation you didn't chose and still managed to make that kid happy, sacrifice your dream without questions, and loved her. 
She died and now you have another life, the one you wanted, that you couldn't have with your daughter, so of course you're seeing things in a different perspective. 
But you didn't want her to die, you didn't leave her, and if she was still alive you probably wouldn't question your life or want her death, you would find another life, another way to be happy.
No one ever knows how things are gonna go or what you'll feel about it, and none of what you said was bad, it's just a different perspective."

I used to feel like I should have more friends, like you see in movies or else, but I'm trying now to make peace with the fact that's also completely normal to have some few friends, if what you have is worth it and real. 
You look like a great person, I'm sure this tough moment will go away. Maybe there are some app to help meet new people / doing activities ?"

 That picture is beautiful. I send to you, your grandmother and Oakley all off my more positive wishes."
