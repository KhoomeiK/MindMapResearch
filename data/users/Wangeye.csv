OverwatchUniversity,fegjxhj,t1_fega3zp,1579095029.0,"You're getting downvotes, but I think your stance is reasonable. What people are having a hard time with is that they need to be able to look at their play and say ""I threw that fight,"" and not feel (too) bad about it. From my perspective, you're not trying to excuse toxic behavior; merely stating that throws happen all the time, whether intentional or not, and trying to minimize one's own is the way to learn. One can ""throw"" without ""inting,"" or 'intentionally throwing'.

Edit: As an aside, I think the people who have been more subject to abusive treatment from previous interactions with the ranked environment have been primed to have a more negative view of the term ""throw,"" which is likely a contributing factor to this disagreement."

Edit to elaborate, adopt instead, please. There are plenty of children that need warm homes and families. I don't want to hear about costs, children are expensive anyway and, in today's world, you should not be surprised if they need financial assistance into their twenties, regardless of their genealogical relation.
