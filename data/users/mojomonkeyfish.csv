todayilearned,ffqz555,t1_ffqtokd,1580146902.0,"Data is stored as binary numbers (1 and 0) called bits.  Generally, those are grouped into Bytes (8 bits), like 10101010.  On a CD, bits are basically little pits in the reflective surface which either deflect away (0?) or reflect back (1?) the laser to a sensor.  I'm not sure which is which, but it doesn't really matter.  Obviously, it would be very easy to scratch the CD and damage the data that is stored.  This is an issue with other forms of data storage as well, and is also an issue when transmitting data over networks.

To combat corrupted data, extra information called ""parity"" is added.  The parity bit is an extra bit that indicates whether the number of 1s or 0s in the byte is odd or even.  You can check that the byte is or isn't corrupted (has a flipped bit) with that.

Further, you can use parity to ""reconstruct"" a piece of missing/corrupted data in a set.  Like, let's say I had the following set of bytes, followed by a ""parity"" byte:

01010101

10101010

11111111

\--------------

11111111 <- all columns have an even number of 1s

If any single member of the three bytes above were missing, you could look at the parity byte and say ""well, the first number must be X, because there must be an even number of 1s in this column""

That's a simple example of how parity/error correction works.  It can be more complex in practice, and I have no idea how it works on CDs."

However, the 1918 virus hit during an unprecedented conflict that saw millions of people displaced and placed via and into optimal conditions for spreading the disease.  Soldiers, refugees, and orphans were being shuttled around in steerage to and from infected areas with little concern.

The world is more connected physically, now.  But, we're exponentially more connected with communication.  Knowledge of a virus can (and does) easily travel faster than the virus itself.  I mean, not to kill everyone's plague-boner, but it's very hard for a deadly virus to survive bad PR.  Even seemingly intractable viruses like Ebola end up getting the shit kicked out of them by attention.  All the various contagion-doomsday paraphernalia - guys with hazmat suits in white tents - actually works to destroy contagions, even when a ""cure"" can't be miraculously invented.

Triggering people's paranoia about sanitation and disease transmission is probably the most powerful means of control that could ever exist.

videos,ffcha9i,t1_ffcbhrv,1579799440.0,"> 60,000 people died last year to the flu, so getting hyperbolic about this is probably not worth it. 

Yes, the various strains of human-borne influenza that constantly circulate around the world, claim many lives (actually, more on the order of 250,000 - 600,000 per year).  That's a baseline.

Here's the thing about viruses:  Killing their host isn't a great survival strategy, and the ""mutations"" (which people seem to constantly fear will happen) that happen to a human-to-human virus are unlikely to be selected if they are more lethal.  A virus like this, or H1N1, or SARS, are dangerous BECAUSE they're new to humans.  This is a virus that has adapted to live in pigs.  Now it's in humans.  It hasn't adapted to living in humans - it's only just now adapted to being transmitted to/between them - and so the mortality rate can be significantly higher, and happen in healthier people.

  
Influenza spreads to \~20% of the world population every year.  It does so year-over-year because it mutates rapidly, but in a given year it's one or two strains that manage to hit those numbers.  The average person suffers from 2 or 3 viral respiratory infections per year.  We pass these around constantly.  The common cold can probably take partial credit for a lot of influenza deaths - the cold came first (or second and third as well), caused bronchitis, weakened the persons respiratory system, then influenza hits and they get severe pneumonia and die.

If this version of coronavirus is anywhere near as effective at spreading as others, it could very quickly spread across the globe.  SARS - the last major animal-to-human-to-human coronavirus outbreak - had about a 10% mortality rate.  Fortunately, it was identified and contained.  It was in the news as ""media hyperbole"".  People got freaked out.  People and governments started taking measures to not contract or spread viruses, because they're ""sheep"" (who also maybe should try not to spray their viral load on each other even when it's just the mildly deadly seasonal influenza variant).  It isn't a fucking coincidence that SARS was a victim of its own success.

Compare that to the Influenza of 1918 (Spanish Flu).  That had a 10-20% mortality, and also a novel mutation that meant very limited immunity conferred from other strains - so basically everyone could catch it.  The governmental response was terrible, and they tried to suppress knowledge of the disease as it would be bad for moral.  The reason we call it ""Spanish Flu"" is because Spain was the only country that actually reported on and talked about it early on.  It went on to spread to a huge amount of people and killed something like 3-6% of the world population.

Dipshits always want to rock in to these conversations like ""They talked about that other virus, and it was NBD"", but literally the media/government hype is the REASON it was no big deal.  God forbid we ever come up against a virus that is immune to preparation and prevention, like apparently we need to, in order to justify covering them."

Honestly, the thing that amazed me was how prolific Netbus was, given that it wasn't a ""virus"" or ""worm"" - it didn't spread itself or do anything on its own.  It didn't ""phone home"", either, so it was useless for some kind of mass campaign.  It was pretty much a one-to-one prank tool - get your friend to install it or install it on their machine, and then you could connect remotely, but you had to know their IP - which would change every time they dialed up (so, multiple times a day).  I think the guy who made it actually intended for it to be a legitimate network admin tool - it was basically a crude prototype of modern remote desktop software, which was very cool at the time.  Given that, I was astounded that I'd find dozens of new people every day.  Like, why are all these rednecks pranking each other?"

If you're downloading nudes or stealing identities, you're a criminal.  Cleaning up afterward isn't even ""helping"".  In the days of Netbus, digital cameras weren't even really mainstream yet, and nobody had any nudes to steal or decent shit to snoop on.  And, as somebody else has mentioned, you didn't even need a trojan or hacking tools half the time: people would be directly connected to the internet and sharing their files without even really understanding that."
