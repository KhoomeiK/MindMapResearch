todayilearned,fgswiyn,t1_fgsjbd2,1581094121.0,"You have any evidence for this? Even Windows doesn't do this.  It most certainly doesn't know what content within a website you viewed in your browser.  It's got a DNS cache which will retain details on domains you have visited, but by default it only stores these for up to one day and considers them stale after that.

From a forensics perspective I think your best hope would be that they use it very little and you can recover the deleted cache items that incognito still creates. Viewing something in incognito, it still uses the disk to cache, it just wipes it at the end.  Chance that weeks later you could recover some of that, but realistically there will be enough other activity that'll wipe it out.

What I'd probably do is get what you can from the ISP as far as dns queries, connection data if they have it,  then go to like Facebook and Google and see what kind of tracking they pulled off thanks to ads and explicit website tracking."

So yes, it's a ""decryptable format"", but realistically no one is decrypting it without your password. from a search, with a 9 character password you're looking at probably 50-100+ years for a normal desktop. So yes, maybe a large corporation or state entity could shorten that down to days/weeks with a farm of machines.  Add a few more characters and even that farm of machines would take years.

I vastly prefer to watch things on Plex purely because it does not do this. It plays it out to the very last second, then gives a five second timer to play the next episode.  If I want to skip the credits i can jump ahead in time super quick anyways.  There's no annoying auto play trailers in the UI.  The ordering of sections is identical every time, and configurable. With the default to focus on shows/movies you left in the middle of,  then next episodes for things you watched most recently. It just makes fucking sense.

At the start, it'll be just slicing off pieces until the bias cut can go the full depth.  At the end, you'd also start getting tapering fin lengths as it runs out of full height.  Thus I assume you use longer pieces of material for this, lose a bit at the start and end,  and chop up the result into multiple heatsinks.

[This video](https://youtu.be/lf6YfSqKJR0) maybe makes it clearer what is going on?

Edit: The nuts part to me is how it's compressing.  The height of the final fins is significantly smaller than the diagonal slice of material it's making.  In some of these you can more easily see the material shrinking, so it's definitely in he deformation range, but in such a way it isn't doing so unevenly and instead just compresses?"

Thus why currently there has to be a belt or lift from the building which ensures that is the limiting speed factor.

A nice QoL though would be able to snap a splitter/merger to the output, and auto build a belt between them of a specific type.  It wouldn't break progression and save a lot of hassle.

7daystodie,ffs798b,t1_ffs4e8k,1580174866.0,"Some other fun blood moon horde info I've found both from playing and examining XML.

The horde is made up of 3 stages. Each stage lasts for either till the last zombie from it is killed, or 2 hours for the first 2 and 7 for the last, in-game hours,  thus if you changed the game to have 18 hour nights and 6 hour days it seems like the blood moon might cease after 11 hours anyways.

When it swaps waves, it swaps where they spawn and what set of units it can spawn.  I find later it is impractical to kill an entire wave and so the 2 hours becomes the likely marker.  Thus it can be useful to pay attention to the clock in-game and know that, for a normal config, at midnight they'll be coming from a new direction and if you hadn't been getting demolishers, vultures, etc.  they might start showing up now.  Then again at 2am.

Similarly, if you notice it swap directions before those times, that means you managed to kill an entire wave of zombies quick enough. Keep that up and you might wipe out the blood moon horde before sun rise!  Later game stages I've only managed that by increasing number of zombies spawned per player which can make things considerably harder, or kill your server if it can't handle it."
7daystodie,ffs69s4,t1_ffs3tr5,1580174183.0,"That would definitely do it!  different post I put in the actual formula. The other half of it i don't think you can forcefully set, it's number of days survived minus deaths times a multiplier.  Level 300 alone will at least give you 300 * difficulty multiplier for game stage. With 3 of you, group game stage would then be 300 + 240 + 180 = 720.  The game's xml actually scales the blood moon horde up to a potential gamestage of 4086, but 720 is plenty to ensure max number of zombies for 3 people alive at a time and unlikely you kill all 1500 it could spawn over the night.

Edit: also if you didn't realize every blood moon horde has 3 waves.  The next wave begins as soon as either: A) You kill the entire wave.  or B) 2 in-game hours pass.  Each wave has a different make-up of units and will spawn from a different general area."
7daystodie,ffs4e8k,t1_ffr5jsr,1580172851.0,"I'm curious if that's maybe slightly a misunderstanding of horde difficulty? If you just changed the day from like 70 to 700, the blood moon horde would be no different.  You need to increase your gamestage to make the horde difficult. It's roughly a combination of your level, days survived (personally, and changing date/time doesn't add to this), deaths,  and chosen difficulty level.

Roughly the formula is: 

    gameStage = ( playerLevel + daysSurvived ) * gameDifficultyMultiplier

Where daysSurvived is a combination of days you've lived for,  minus a portion for each time you have died.  Bounded to something between 0 and your current level.  So if you're level 100, then your game stage is somewhere between 100-200 times the current difficulty's multiplier.  It's shown on the player list for the server.

Then if you're in a group, with say 3 people,  the group gets a gamestage which is used for the horde which is

    group gamestage = 1 * <highest player gamestage> + 0.8 * <second highest player gamestage> + (0.6 * <third highest player gamestage>

That is then what is used for the horde difficulty.  Changing the date in game to day 700 would have no effect on any of this and thus the hordes you fight would have been no different than if  you set it to day 7. Thus maybe you expected some epic horde for changing the day to 700?

Edit: Mentioned elsewhere, they noticed pathetic horde and bumped their level up to 300 which would work wonderfully to boost game stage."
7daystodie,ffs2es2,t3_eur51u,1580171462.0,"So bit curious, what is meant by ""700+ day horde"".  I believe the days last mattered in Alpha 16, and from 17 onward they instead based it upon gamestage.  If you were a brand new player fighting your own blood moon, even on day 700 for a server now, it'd be a rather tiny thing. Meanwhile you could be a level 200 guy who has never died and fight an epic horde on day 7.

Then they got these requests, but going back and subtitling all of that content suddenly makes a project that cost <$1000,  into something that will cost a lot more than that. What was one engineer spending a few days scripting something to upload all the videos to youtube, now means paying to go over 20,000 videos. For each of which you need at least one person to go and determine all the time code points that you need text. Then someone needs to fill in the text for all of that, and lastly you need someone to review all of that. Make sure there's no glaring typos, mistakes, etc. For a given hour of content, it probably takes a minimum of 3 hours of work to do all this. Usually more, but I guess if you do a super low-effort job where the subtitles don't show up at perfect times etc. it can work. Maybe automated tools to help too. Being lectures, they're probably all at least 1 hour long, probably longer. Based upon that, you're looking at of 60,000+ hours of work time to subtitle all of this. That's 30 man years of work. Even if you farm it out to the least skilled workers you can find to do it, you're probably still looking at over $1 million to do this.

Kinda bums me as it seems like they could have shifted things slightly so the grommets were on the sides instead of the bottom and then all 5 would fit with grommets.  I assume because they made one standard design which has room for a 5.25"" bay in one configuration.

Otherwise I am in a similar boat as you.  Get the Rosewill with the knowledge of those grommets, or consider something else. Thus replies here are helpful.

Spray bottles can often sort of work.  If you can squirt the cat while they do something without them realizing it was you and at least initially you can be present to squirt them every time they do it, it can work.  So like let them in room with furniture that can be scratched only while you're there, and discretely squirt them every time they scratch it.

programming,fdquj0x,t1_fdqfqmy,1578675129.0,"I was looking to add some drives to my home server this last week and was looking at the options. In the past I've always used mdadm plus something on top of it, usually just ext4.  I've considered BTRFS and ZFS in the past, but previously BTRFS either still didn't have equivalent to raid5, or it was considered highly experimental. ZFS wasn't as simple to get up and running and keep running so it was ruled out.

This time though? BTRFS raid support is still experimental. It's considerably better and mostly missing changes to avoid the write hole. ZFS has become a lot easier to use with Linux however and everything I read suggested it was much more reliable than BTRFS for a raid5 like setup.  Digging further, managing a btrfs setup seemed more painful. The commands required were not as intuitive or nice.  Frequently requiring adjusting of mount options etc. ZFS meanwhile was trivial to start up a new pool/array, and operations to restore etc. after a failure were better, and faster than btrfs. I hope that btrfs does close these gaps, but it still seems like the admin usability won't be as nice even when it does.

So I strongly agree that ZFS has situations where it is by far the best option, and Linus stating ""why would you ever want to use it in the first place"" is his usual shortsightedness where he's unable to imagine situations besides his own."
programming,fdqtdxf,t1_fdq69xt,1578674471.0,"In that case he should not have used this terminology:

> why would you ever want to use it in the first place

I get that he has specific use cases in mind, but it seems short sighted to assume that because for his use case it's not as good as other options, that no one should want to use it.  I recently started using it on a file server. I considered other options,  btrfs,  some other file system plus mdadm,  etc.  and ZFS was significantly better than the other options. In reliability,  performance, and maintenance.

I think that most Linux users looking at using ZFS is for multi-disk use cases, so excluding those and considering it useless seems silly. It'd be like claiming mdadm is useless and no one should use it, because you are only considering desktop users with a single disk."
programming,fdqsnl0,t1_fdpq0aq,1578674023.0,"Yeah that's the statement that made me scratch my head. I'm primarily interested in some of the raid 5 type redundancy features and ZFS's raidz is set up in a great manner that's highly resilient. btrfs is getting there, but it's taking them a decade to catch up it feels like.  Even when they do, from what I've seen the end user experience for managing it is a lot nicer for zfs than it is for btrfs.  Benchmarks for raid level operations around recovery etc.  ZFS performs better as well.  Maybe for other metrics it's not as good, or the use cases Linus cares about.  For me, and I assume many others however it is better in the metrics we care about.  The no maintenance comment seems stupid. Anyone can see quite a lot of activity on their github repo.

Thus this part comes off as highly opinionated.  The license arguments however do have merit. Current licenses are incompatible and it does seem like if you wanted to re-license or dual-license ZFS as GPL, or something else that is GPL compatible like say BSD, it'd require Oracle to do that. They can't strip away the current CDDL version that is out there, but they could add GPLv2, which they apparently have done in the past for DTrace. I wouldn't hold my breath on them doing it for ZFS though."

Most grids in the US and probably elsewhere are much better about avoiding over voltage when power is restored these days I think. Under voltage, or a brown out, though I still see.
