I still cherish my experience as a Ph.D. student, but it is time to move on to something I really enjoy doing.  I prefer to work on real-life problems and provide meaningful and practical solutions, like the products and services in your company."

college,fdhbjr8,t3_elcmhp,1578419432.0,"Time management is not a big deal if we put some real effort into organizing our day to day stuff in the right balance between college, job, and studies. First of all, we have to take our own time to put in order our priorities. Let me give some points which helped me to cope with this.

1. Starting slowly. Not committing to work a lot of hours immediately. This will put us under immense pressure. It is better to get the ball rolling slow and steady.

2. Making a To-do list. We can make a list of points regarding anything which we've to complete in a particular time frame. It can be either our studies or work.

3. Prioritizing it. If we don't prioritize our works we'll end up in doing nothing. So it is better to mention what to do first and last.

4. Being attentive and taking a lot of notes in the classes. This way we don't have to spend so much time recollecting the points while we study.

5. Having a quality sleep. It is very important to have quality sleep than quantity sleep. Scientifically it is referred to as REM ( Rapid Eye Movement ) sleep. You can google it later. :) So don't forget to sleep on time.

6. Wake up as early as possible. Doing some exercises help us to focus our state of mind. Exercises work in the same way sleep does.

7. Looking through our To-do list and class notes. Make sure that we're not keeping anything for pending till date and studying as well.

In my case, it is the opposite. I'm working full time and doing my part-time studies along with the job. But still, I apply the same principles which seem well effective.

Hope this helps. :)"
jobs,fdh40zj,t3_eldcz9,1578414909.0,"Believe it or not, finding a good job is difficult even for applicants with degrees. Finding a good job in a competitive job market is a job in itself. Apply to jobs your skills, expertise, and experience qualify you for even if you don’t meet the educational requirements. There is a good chance your resume will stand out due to other qualifications. Although many employers on FlexJobs are looking for people with at least a bachelor’s degree, there are many others who look at hard work and experience above a diploma. It is possible to find a job without a college degree.

In your cover letter, avoid focusing on your lack of a degree. Sentences like, “I know I don’t have a bachelor’s degree, but…” only highlight your lack of a degree. Instead, focus on the skills that you do have, and explain how your job experiences make you a strong fit for the job."

jobs,fcymrn2,t3_ejhcs1,1578082929.0,"If you have a reliable vehicle and know your way around town, there are openings for drivers in all the cities where ride-sharing is permitted. Another option is to deliver packages for companies like Amazon. You’ll be able to work a flexible schedule and use your car to earn cash. You may even have thought about freelancing full-time. If that’s the case, doing some side gigs is a good way to see whether a transition to self-employment makes sense. Third, You don’t have to have an advanced college degree to become a tutor. College students are often hired to tutor elementary and high school students or as peer tutors, and, for older candidates, a bachelor’s degree in a subject area can help you line up tutoring jobs for after school, evenings, and weekends."

furniture,fcxl8g4,t3_ej79ys,1578065645.0,"It’s big enough to comfortably people (almost 6-feet tall), and the 3 seater Vimle is wide enough or a good nap.  It's definitely a firmer sofa, so if you prefer a softer seating, you might want to look elsewhere. It's pretty modular, and it's one of the only sofas that had a one-seater (makes an adorable single chair) and the chaise has storage underneath.   I think my biggest complaint is that sometimes the back cushions don't really lay flat, they curl, almost like the cover isn't big enough to fit the cushion. I think just some adjusting and fluffing could hopefully fix it."

If you’re job-hunting, there’s no perfect time (or reason) to stop looking, but if you’re going to take a break, this is probably the best time to do it. The surge of hiring activity in the fall drops off significantly during the holiday season, roughly December through mid-January. On the other hand, the New Year is a time when lots of people resolve to find a new job. By the time February rolls around, workers are shuffling to new jobs, creating openings that organizations need to fill. Make sure you’re ready when that happens."
