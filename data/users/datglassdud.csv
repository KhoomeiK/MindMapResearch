The shah of Iran retains his benevolent [world] image despite the highest rate of death penalties in the world, no valid system of civilian courts and a history of torture which is beyond belief. ... the total number of political prisoners has been reported at times throughout the year [1975] to be anything from 25,000 to 100,000"".[255][256]

At the Federation of American Scientists, John Pike writes:

In 1978 the deepening opposition to the Shah erupted in widespread demonstrations and rioting. Recognising that even this level of violence had failed to crush the rebellion, the Shah abdicated the Peacock Throne and fled Iran on 16 January 1979. Despite decades of pervasive surveillance by SAVAK, working closely with CIA, the extent of public opposition to the Shah, and his sudden departure, came as a considerable surprise to the US intelligence community and national leadership. As late as 28 September 1978 the US Defense Intelligence Agency reported that the Shah ""is expected to remain actively in power over the next ten years.""[257]"

I mean the current dictator if Iran is essentially a British/American puppet and I think you’re forgetting how brutal the shahs regime was."
