TwoXChromosomes,fh45iv4,t1_fh34tdr,1581275413.0,It may be worth discussing with your son the associated genetic risks of delaying when to have children. To my understanding the increased risk is less so for men but still worth understanding about as it could allow him to have an informed discussion about when to try for kids with his partner.
TwoXChromosomes,fh44ggx,t3_f195bf,1581275082.0,I am neither for or against planned parenthood clinics as I live in England so have no need to have an opinion on them. Having said that this shows that planned parenthood was not effectively preventng the root cause of teen pregnancies (underaged sex) and only reducing the end result (via contraception and abortion) this would indicate to me a failure in education both at home and school for the affected youths. It is our responsibility as adults to teach children how to make good informed decisions and our failure as a society when such bad decisions become common place.

Obviously in the post he seems to be on the phone to the parents when approaching the door so he can't use the princess carry lol."
holdmycosmo,fh31ucr,t1_fh2fnfh,1581263697.0,"People on this post don't seem to understand just how easily a serious and deadly head injury can be overlooked when alcohol is involved. The common symptoms of head trauma include dizziness, vomiting, headaches, unresponsive pupils and pupils with different levels of dilation. All of these symptoms are also typical alcohol abuse and hangovers (not 100% sure regarding pupil dilation and hangovers) and are often dismissed until it is too late which can be fatal.

 You did the right thing to have your friend checked by someone with medical knowledge, though a ER doctor would probably have been a better choice."
holdmycosmo,fh30l3g,t1_fh2xqm8,1581263253.0,"If someone is passed out for an extended period and a head injury is involved you should absolutely take them for a medical assessment. Slow bleeding injuries in the skull are deadly if not found soon enough with symptoms of dizziness, vomiting, headaches all symptoms that can easily be mistaken for a hangover. It is ridiculous how many people are dismissing important medical advice as being overly cautious in this post, failure to take people to a hospital is a very serious matter."

GetMotivated,fgs8nrb,t3_ezvyuq,1581076574.0,"Some people in this comment section are a bit confused and are taking the sentence ""the circumstances of one's birth"" to be talking of literal circumstances being poor, disabled ect. In the context of the movie the sentence is actually a metaphor for race with the clones representing a new race of Pokémon and Mewtwo realising that it doesn't matter what race you are born because everyone is born fundamentally equal."

UpliftingNews,fgmr2em,t1_fgmitt4,1580930319.0,"Aye as I said they deserve equal time with the baby (parental leave). There is medical leave necessary for the mother as well and that medical leave will often be spent in the hospital especially if complications arose in delivery. During the medical leave the mother may unfortunately be required to have limited contact as such I believe that the medical leave should be available separate to the parental leave. 

Sorry that my meaning wasn't clear in the first comment."
UpliftingNews,fgmebdo,t1_fgm35rc,1580922864.0,I always disliked the term feminism solely for it being inherently gendered which detracts from the ideal of true equality in my opinion. Equality is not a gendered issue but a societal goal where in a careful balance between necessary difference of treatment (gendered medical research for instance) and equality must be found.
UpliftingNews,fgmdb3c,t3_ez9358,1580922359.0,"I partially disagree with this, definitely both parents should be given equal personal leave to spend with the child however the mother (except in cases of adoption or surrogacy) inescapably needs the added medical leave for obvious reasons."
