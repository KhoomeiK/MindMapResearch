youseeingthisshit,ffl9l5h,t1_ffk3gpe,1580036819.0,I meant the link on the previous comment was hilarious. It seems to be 100% real. Not the video these comments are on
gadgets,ffkae19,t1_ffj77l9,1580019560.0,"Something to consider is iPhones still come with 5 watt chargers. Only the Pros come with 18 watt chargers, which have Type C on one end/the block(Why not go full C and give users faster charging overall?). This is still far behind 25w in box charger from Samsung/45w maximum capability, and 18w in box for all Pixel models. This isn't counting Huawei or others that come with faster chargers in box, for free. This all means most of these phones can get 50% battery in 30 min or so, and full battery within an hour or so. If you're waiting for your flight or just getting ready, you can have a huge jump in battery life with a few minutes. I charge my Note10+ every other day, using it for lots of reddit, Youtube with full QHD screen settings, and using Bluetooth buds for audio. All that and it still takes under an hour to charge it up when it's low.

Another issue for iPhone users is that Apple still maxes out wireless charging at 7.5 watts. All others have been at 15 watts for some time now. Xoaomi is now at 20w wireless charging. 

I mentioned the ""for free"" part because if you want an 18w apple charger for your Iphone, it'll cost at least $49.99 extra."

insanepeoplefacebook,ffju02m,t1_fefnc0m,1580006902.0,"This always happens. One of my jobs was at a family owned business, the owners were always there and micromanaging. Not entirely bad except I found out I earned more than some very good workers that had been there for almost a decade and I had only been there a few months. I quit on the spot when they gave out very nice tools to project the workers, then asked for them back because they didn't realize the 'expense' and using very cheap tools was 'better' I couldn't report them because friends would lose their jobs, but I'm still salty."

YouShouldKnow,ff775z9,t1_ff70swj,1579642458.0,I agree. I got into headlight retrofitting because I couldn't deal with the crappy original lights on my cars and I wasn't about to blind everyone else.

Weird note: Once my gf wanted me to do it as part of a foot treatment, so I did. Had a weird tingle on my toe but let it go. Later found out that I had beee bit by a spider, and the soak cleaned up the wound and nothing came of the bite."

pics,fecy7r4,t1_fecxp7q,1578989498.0,"Iirc the block heater pushes the coolant around while heating, like the engine would when running. This keeps the block warm and then technically does keep the oil flowing and not sludging up like oil would in freezing temperatures.

Edit: I described inline block heaters. I just learned that there's also some that go on the oil pan and heat the oil up, or blankets that go over the engine to warm up the entire area under the hood."
Justrolledintotheshop,fe037cw,t1_fdwlrx2,1578801936.0,Yeah I've watched all of those. Been obsessed with them since I saw the first video (except the wing he's making). I can't afford a salvaged car at the moment nor do I have the space/time. This why I also looked for engines. If the engine I have now lasts I'd love to get a wrecked 3.6l. to swap mainly for the fuel economy.
