AmItheAsshole,fe4n874,t1_fe2qcaz,1578861047.0,"It seems like the rules are very different depending on where people live or go to school. I am very surprised by what most people in this thread are describing.    
At the schools (including university) here it is not against the rules to share your text with each other if the purpose is to help each other. They just remind the students that even if you are helping each other, you still can’t give the same answers (meaning no copying). Of course it might make it more difficult to know who to “punish”, but they don’t want to discourage people from helping each other.    
Now I realize the reason behind the behavior of a couple of the exchange students though."
AmItheAsshole,fdo5uhp,t1_fdnd1ud,1578599425.0,"Well I guess it depends heavily on which country, and maybe also city, in Europe. It’s not common where I live to randomly check people’s bags/purses.    
I have absolutely never stolen, but I have set off the alarms at the exit of the stores several times, and yet no one has ever asked to check my bag. In a situation like this I even understand why they would want to, but they never did. The store workers sometimes gave me some helpful tips about why the alarm might have been triggered, like old barcode sticker in my jacket pocket or something like that (they were usually amazingly correct with their guesses), and they never seemed to think I had done something."
cats,fdnyenf,t1_fdnxmjf,1578595375.0,"I think you’re confusing this with head pressing, when the cat will just press their head against for example a wall or other surface, for no apparent reason. In this post the cat’s just sleeping in a funny position."
AskReddit,fdn5u19,t1_fdn1u9e,1578578112.0,"My family did this (changing clothes), but I seemed to be the only one of my friends as a kid, and it doesn’t seem that most people here do it for hygiene reasons. We live in Europe. As I got older  more of my friends started changing their pants when getting home, if they didn’t have any plans later, but it wasn’t because of any house rules, it was because they wanted to wear comfortable pants at home and most of the pants they wore outside were tight jeans. No one wears shoes inside though, that’s definitely not normal here."
AskReddit,fdk4r7o,t1_fdjlfft,1578496024.0,"You just reminded me of my idiot moment. A classmate had just lost his dad to cancer. I didn’t know about it. Our teacher comes in and tell us about the death. I’m not listening, I’m lost in my own head and then I remember something really funny and start LAUGHING. I’m just so glad that kid wasn’t there."
AskReddit,fdiy77t,t1_fdik29x,1578453752.0,Yeah I’m also from Europe and that’s what I assumed too. Not a thing where I live at least.
AmItheAsshole,fdhbyua,t1_fdgkp3i,1578419658.0,"Exactly. Instead of dragging down the girl he could have lifted up his son and told them they were wrong, like this maybe:     
“That’s not true at all and actually not acceptable  of you guys to say. I am very proud of my son, he isn’t only a good guy, but also very smart. I don’t feel the need to brag about him every time I see you, but my son is most definitely a winner. He is top of his class and wins state competitions. He is incredible and I would never wish he was any different than he is”."

AskReddit,fdcmv9l,t1_fd6fboi,1578278850.0,"I guess it might be because of possible health problems if given to older men (since it affects more than just sex drive and older men might have more health issues or be at risk, and their testosterone production gets lower as they get older), but I don’t actually know."
AmItheAsshole,fdc5ye8,t1_fdbctko,1578267756.0,"What about “don’t” or “stop”? Like can you say no without actually using that word? But it’s still so ...weird. And since you’re not used to this, you would have to stop yourself every time to think about what word you should use, and by that time she might have already done whatever she was trying to do. The parents can try to make up other ways of saying it, but they can’t really except you to. And them reacting to “no thanks” made me laugh."
ChoosingBeggars,fdbwrzv,t1_fd7pj7k,1578263089.0,"In the AITA sub it’s encouraged to upvote the assholes. It makes for an interesting read and more people see the post. It’s a common complaint that there are too many “boring” posts (which is basically when the poster is obviously not an asshole), so you want to even it out. Worst thing you can do is downvote someone who is an completely asshole, because then less people might get the pleasure of reading that shit and telling the poster what an idiot they are."
ChoosingBeggars,fdbuckk,t1_fd86qn7,1578262135.0,"Dude no, that’s what you’re encouraged to do on the AITA sub. It’s encouraged to upvote the assholes, because it’s fun to read. And you are certainly not supposed to downvote them, because then less people will see the post and there’s no fun in only reading posts where the person is not an asshole."
AmItheAsshole,fdb2o3p,t1_fd9ohww,1578253083.0,"Well given what you did you are the one that has the most to apologize about. 

Your teenage (not adult) daughter with split personality/dissociative identity disorder acted out and you cut her off from your life completely. Was she even herself when she did this? Girl was probably pretty ill at that point.    
Some teenagers do shit like this, and you know what their parents do? They do their fucking job and parent them. Obviously teaching them responsibility is a part of that, but not this way. 

You sound like a horrible father who doesn’t feel the love a parent should have for their child.    
She’s probably better off without you though."
AmItheAsshole,fd5ywar,t1_fd3hsn4,1578183248.0,"Having cats in the kitchen and kitchen counter is pretty common, but it means you have to clean the kitchen counter often and well, especially before making food. The litter box should not be full, it should be cleaned every day or more (and with 8 cats she should probably have more litter boxes). (Edit: want to say that I do understand what you mean about it being relevant to the food , given how  there’s uncleaned litter boxes+cats on the kitchen counter, in an unclean house)

Is it possible it’s not always like this at her home, maybe she was having a bad week or two and that’s why her house was so horrible? (She obviously shouldn’t let it affect her cats though.) And maybe she always cleans her kitchen before making food? I hope so"

So to all Americans; please don’t immediately be upset when someone you don’t know on Reddit mentions not getting the shot, that person might just not live in a place where it’s that common to get it.

On another note, I would gladly have taken it if it meant I could help out with my close friend’s toddler. As far as I know, most people don’t feel sick after taking it, but I might be misinformed."

AmItheAsshole,fc1j47d,t1_fc1h6ta,1577320291.0,"Yes I don’t understand how he’s “proving” anything by showing  they can’t tell him apart from his *identical* twin. We had identical twins at our school, (at some point two pairs but I never knew the other pair). Our favorite teachers, who knew us all very well, would have troubles telling them apart. Because they knew both, they could understand who was who based on their behavior, but as I said, that only worked because they knew both. The assigned seats helped most teachers. Several classmates would also have trouble sometimes, including people who would even have lunch with them not days. There were also some people in their class that could almost never tell them apart. People who didn’t have classes with them didn’t really stand a chance. 

OP doesn’t seem to be close to his in-laws, so why would they notice? Especially when they would never have expected him to do something like this? 

However I do think it’s weird that they didn’t even speak to him. In some families it’s not common for people to take initiative to speak instead of waiting to be asked, and it seems like OP doesn’t really try to include himself, which he should. But if you notice someone  is being quiet, especially a invited guest/family member, maybe ask them a few questions and try to include them anyway!That’s why I’m leaning towards esh, but OP’s attitude seem worse to me, although some more info might clear that up"

You could play along and tell her she should stay in a hotel because your cat has been shedding a lot lately and you aren’t able to clean everything, and you don’t want her to die"
