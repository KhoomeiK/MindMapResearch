You’ll have fewer and fewer bad days and eventually, they’ll be gone. Be strong and patient with the process. Cutting them out is for the best."
SuicideWatch,fcqc6lj,t3_eifxv1,1577883111.0,"It’s 6 am and I’m waking up from a blackout but this wasn’t a waste. I always share information with my therapist and psychiatrist, and I can only recommend you do the same. Also, if anything, you  acknowledge your behavior (even before it happens), which is better than 99% of people. 

Balancing friends, family, school,  and relationships is incredibly stressful. Because you’re a normal person, you get overwhelmed. I guess my recommendation is to step back and try to see yourself in the position you’re in and be conscious of it. You’re a human who can’t handle everything perfectly and that’s just fine."
SuicideWatch,fcqab05,t3_eig69n,1577882043.0,"Your story is tragic man. It’s so stressful to meet your own expectations of where you’re supposed to be at a given point in life. Your post reminds me of a song: color by the dangerous summer (if it were sang to oneself about oneself). Therapy has helped me organize my thoughts some. I’d definitely try it if you have questions and have no idea how to answer them. 

Also, letting people around you know you need help is always good. You might even be surprised by who really does care. 

Sometimes depression comes in waves and you have to ride the damn thing out. Keep looking for whatever makes you happy and it will be worth it when you find it."
drunk,fcq7ilf,t1_fcq4sn8,1577880389.0,I guess so. I have no ability to predict when I will blackout either. It’s not like the usual drunk wave. Maybe I should find a new drug lol
BreakUps,fcq7a4m,t1_fcq5ail,1577880249.0,"First, it’s is very unfair. Oftentimes the pain and constant anxiety is seemingly immeasurable; however, these are the times you grow the most. You’d be depriving yourself of this  opportunity if you did things differently. If they jumped into a relationship quickly, then it’s likely because they cannot handle being alone and facing what you’re going through now. You have to embrace the fact that you will suffer, but also you will get stronger. 

A mentor of mine who once said, “So you feel pain? That’s a good thing.” When you get through this, all the pain will make you so much stronger. That quote has often helped me."
SuicideWatch,fcq5b1a,t3_e8gjky,1577879034.0,"You’ve been through way worse than me mate. I was tied up at gun point during a robbery. I felt like I was fighting back whenever I’d move forward in the right direction. I always thought, “Don’t let them continue to hurt you!” I was constantly reliving everything and the investigation consumed me. It wasn’t until much later that I realized it made me a stronger person. Idk if you’ll ever see this or if it helps but I’m truly heartbroken by your story and hope you get better."
BreakUps,fcq36vo,t3_eiezyz,1577877733.0,They probably would enjoy the idea that you are sad right now. You’ve done the smart thing by not giving them that satisfaction and venting to a safe place instead.
BreakUps,fcq2q7w,t3_eigng6,1577877446.0,"You’re only human if you have obsessive thoughts over someone who broke your heart. You don’t have to embrace the idea that you’re going to think about them all the time, but acknowledging that it’s going to happen—merely as a consequence of being human—gives you a perspective that helps you access yourself and your breakup, which is helpful. Sometimes it’s hard to know how to move forward and know where you are unless you have a full understanding of where you’ve been. 
I wouldn’t dwell on the missed opportunities because it seems like you’re giving yourself time to actually move on instead of looking for a quick escape emotionally and physically. 
I’d just continue to learn from it and understand yourself and how you handle the situation. Also, I think you’re on the right track by posting here. 

Good luck mate!"
BreakUps,fcq08cr,t3_eif5e1,1577875957.0,"Yes. I love this post. Seriously, your mind is in the right place. Good luck on moving forward and never looking back."
BreakUps,fad12l5,t3_e8joki,1575952161.0,Therapy is great when you don’t have the answers to your own problems. If anything it will give you a chance to organize yourself mentally. I’ve been in it since September because of a breakup and it’s been helpful.
