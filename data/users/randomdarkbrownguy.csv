Stoicism,ffe0lwy,t1_ffdgjwk,1579833613.0,Yea thats what I meant to me they seem to be same as that's how I took the ops quote but after thinking about it I could see the possible different ways some people may take the quotes.
rage,ffdfrnr,t1_ffd282t,1579819948.0,I have never met anyone who considered china first world or developed and I live in a very Chinese area (albeit most if the people are from hong kong)
Stoicism,ffdeyzf,t1_ffd8o0c,1579819469.0,"Yea fair enough I'd imagine what most people would think. In my case when I came across that quote it blew me away because someone who is wearing shining armor never really did shit. To me it was like those standard evil greedy nobles in stories that have their armies do everything and cower away. Where I am in my life right now the quote meamvvs a but more to me since I've come across ideas along the lines of a harmless man is not good because he is harmless but a dangerous man who keeps it under control is truly good. 

So in my case the shining armor one had more impact on me the more I think about it the better it works. 

Funny thing is I never attributed a knight in shining armor as a good person I just attribute it to the standard archetype of a hero in children's stories but I can definitely see how a knight in shining armor could colloquially mean good person to some

Thanks for the point of view"

I usually start off with a warm shower and do all the soap and other cleaning and then crank the faucet thing to a right angle on the cold side and go in. Is it cold? Yeah but since I've been a swimmer for a long time I can tell you if you're already soaked before getting in the water it wont be as bad.

I usually just go headfirst and just spin around slowly and after a minute it's not that bad and ur body gets used to it.

I usually just keep saying to myself I am a man and this is nothing for the man I want to be nd truck through it

Try to stay in there for a minute then longer as you do it everyday

vaxxhappened,fegdoyv,t1_feg6ibc,1579089050.0,"This is interesting since my sis knows about and stays away from all that bs bout essential oils nd crap and from what I understand about her schooling rn is that it's pretty intense. Theres only 1 english speaking one here in canada (and apparently it's one of the best in NA) and shes going to it from and they have 4 sets of exams every year for 3 years and clinical practice for the last one. She is also not allowed to practice on me  as she still needs to learn how to do shit right and  her female profs always warn about the physical strain that makes females retire early.

Maybe it might be the amount of schools in the US or the nature of medical care in America that comes with pushing of people to try it as I have never once been approached by a chiropractor

I'll ask my sister about this stuff but thanks for the rundown

Essentially your saying that many chiros dont stay in their lane and say they can fix shit that isnt substantiated

Though I do realize that people who market essential oils are not inherently dumb it just seems like the curriculum is a but intense just to pop out and try to sell essential oils."

NoFap,fe66rqy,t1_fdzmfso,1578883057.0,"Its seeing women in restraints be it rope,chain, hancuffs whatever it always caused arousal in me since I was kid even wen I watched cartoons I guess it was the vulnerability part or someshit. When I did watch porn I barely watched any sex it was mainly just the binding part and I'd skip through the actual sex since it wasnt desensitized to it like I'd imagine ppl who'd watched it since their childhood. Would just watch the binding and skipped through the sex and just kept watching how it restrained their movements then shut it off and jacked off as I went to sleep didnt help that I jacked off differently too but that's info u didnt ask for.

I remember learning at some point that many rapes are not performed for sex primarily but instead for people who are powerless in their lives abusing their power over someone else basically to experience a power trip or to feel some semblance of power.

After learning that and connecting it to my fetish I was disgusted in myself since it seemed similar with the restricting of the persons movements i.e. their power or atleast that's how I see it but I may have the wrong perspective

It made me hate myself more than I already did and Its a thing i struggle with now though I dont hate myself as much cause I fixed other aspects of my life.

Only good thing is thanks to some YouTube lectures I tried looking how deep those feelings went and found out that even in what little porn i watched/fantasized about a woman crying or being distressed puts me off and Just feels wrong.

Sorry for taking so long to get back to you usually I'm faster than this but I guess I was anxious or someshit."
