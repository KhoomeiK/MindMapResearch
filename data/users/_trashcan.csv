BK weapons can have some terrible R2s, but they’re honestly not terrible with that or the Halberd. You’ll come across another Halberd knight in Tomb if Giants, you can use the same tricks to hopefully get that drop. It’s the best BK weapon of them all, I beat O+S with it last night on NG++ and most people say it’s only worth using in NG. 

I beat Manus NG+ with the Greataxe. Believe it or not, I actually used a ton of R2s on him. With some bosses if you time it correctly after dodging an attack you have *just* enough time to get a safe R2 off. And it’s even safer sometimes because it wouldn’t allow me to get greedy. 
That’s actually how I defeated Manus. it’s such a fun weapon lol. Glad you got it dude. If you’ve beaten Sif you can get the Greatsword of Artorias whenever you want. Just remember it’s a +10 Broken Straight Sword or Hilt, any other swords will produce the Cursed variant. It does not say which is which in their names, only can tell by color and stats.

If there’s anything else you needs, questions or what have you, feel free to come back if you can’t seem to figure it elsewhere!

Actually, did you kill the Halberd knight in Darkroot? he’s guarding the Grass Crest Shield, which is really the only shield I use in the entire game. It boosts stamina regeneration. 
If you haven’t, you should 100% head down there like immediately lol. the shield is A1 and you have another good chance for the Halberd. 
You got lucky man, that BK is the only Greataxe in the game until the very last boss fight. If you haven’t gotten all the weapons by then, be sure to farm them. After you defeat the boss you can’t do anything else in the game. So you wanna make sure you’ve done *everything* before you fight him. 
There’s a lot of stuff you can + should do before fighting final boss to get you ready for NG+."
darksouls,fgmjub9,t1_fgmj92u,1580926032.0,"Just a heads up, I was butthurt about this because I didn’t know, the Artorias swords have stat requirement in all of the categories. 
You will need both 20 faith & 20 Int to wield this sword. along with 24STR and 18dex. So you pump some levels into that if you want to run this sword. it’s fantastic weapon though & scales with all 4 stats. I don’t know why but it does quite a bit extra damage over my Cursed variant and the Abyss Greatsword you get from Artorias’s soul. (Btw, when the time comes, don’t give it away. You’ll know.) 

So yeah, great weapon. Also pick up Quelaag’s Fury Sword with her soul. One of my favorite weapons in the game. Need a curved blade for that one. 
Kill the titanite demons down in Sen’s too, there are 4. But you’ll need rusted iron ring to do it since they’re all in sludge. it’ll be tough but that +5 is **worth** it!

And you’re welcome. Really really hoping that you get the Greataxe. Weighs a ton but is a really really fun weapon to use"
