Zach did play for us, but if you rememeber, he had that nasty concussion, and his doctors didnt think he would ever recover enough to play again, much less at QB."

I can show you a correlation between the average daily precipitation in Nebraska and the number of people who die by falling down stairs, but that doesnt mean theres an actual link between the two.  you just cant compare apples to oranges and expect the same result.  there are approximately 3 million different variables between recruiting at one school and another, and while past performance can be an indicator of future potential, posts like this are just silly."

FordTrucks,fcb2l3p,t1_fcagxqp,1577581481.0,"82 was the last year the 400 was available in the trucks. a possible reason the owner said it was a 460, (besides outright lying) is that since the 400 shares the same bolt pattern,  this may have originally had a 460, and has been swapped at some point.  

related: there are tons of free vin decoders out there, keep searching till you find one if you care what's supposed to be in there, and while you're at it, search for how to find ford block and head casting numbers, as that's going to tell you exactly what you have.
