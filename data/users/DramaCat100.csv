If I absolutely had to pick one, I'd pick Anathem because it's a true tour de force - unbelievably imaginative and clever, I've never read anything like it. But to start with, I strongly recommend Snow Crash because it's the shortest and probably the easiest to read, it'll give you a brilliant insight into Stephenson's writing, the characters are so wonderfully drawn and the writing is beyond genius. The whole thing is just superb. It's like watching a wonderful, imaginative, gripping movie. Just the opening sequence is unique, so well-written. I love it."

You might also like The Borrowers books by Mary Norton and Mistress Masham's Repose by TH White - books about miniature human beings living in our world.

Edit - to add, all of these are ""children's"" books but I've read all of them as an adult - they may be marketed as children's books but they are in no way childish."

booksuggestions,ff3uok2,t3_eri0oj,1579549242.0,"Try Susan Cooper's The Dark is Rising series. It's the closest thing I've read to His Dark Materials, and is absolutely excellent. 
You might also enjoy Peter Dickinson - I loved The Changes Trilogy and The Blue Hawk, but he's written a huge amount of stuff and a lot of it is very similar to Philip Pullman.
Finally, Alan Garner's books are amazing - particularly The Weirdstone of Brisingamen and The Moon of Gomrath and Elidor. Highly recommended."

The National Theatre (UK) has a prop and costume hire department itself for props and costumes from its old shows. You can easily hire whole ""shows"" such as pantomimes. Source - am a member of an amateur dramatic group which often hires stuff and I drive the van to pick them up. The last time we were picking up a pillar and at the hire place while we were getting it we walked past an area where they had lots of doors, including a perfect replica of the door to No.10 Downing St."

When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit by Judith Kerr (you MUST read this - absolute classic book of all time)

Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally (definitely about the Holocaust)

Fireweed and The Dolphin Crossing by Jill Paton Walsh (about the effect of the war in the UK)

Empire of the Sun by JG Ballard (the war in Asia from the pov of a child caught up in it -semi-autobiographical)

Ice Cold in Alex by Christopher Landon (also a wonderful classic film)

The Fortunes of War series (the Balkan Trilogy and the Levant Trilogy) by Olivia Manning 

The Charioteer by Mary Renault

Gone to Soldiers by Marge Piercy

And of course you should also read The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank

I personally hated Captain Corelli's Mandolin by Louis de Berni√®res (but then I also hated The Book Thief) and loads of people loved it. The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje is similar. 

And it's years since I read it, but Catch 22 by Joseph Heller is one of the classics of the genre.  Also The Silver Sword by Ian Serraillier"

cats,fdgefk4,t1_fdfznvz,1578392911.0,"I'm so, so sorry. I had to do the same for my lovely Tigger when she was seventeen and had kidney failure. I knew she'd reached the end and if I hadn't said goodbye she would only have suffered worse and worse until she died and I loved her far too much to put her through that, however painful it was for me. It wasn't bad as I thought it would be because I knew it was the right thing for her, but I missed her so much. Feel free to mourn as much as you need to. You love her and you're losing a family member - mourning is absolutely the appropriate response. 

Regarding Heaven, your kitty will go to heaven for sure. I'm a Christian and I have no doubt at all that Tigger is there. My Mum came back after she died to let me know she and my Dad were fine, and Tigger comes back sometimes too. She used to sleep on my bed at night and sometimes she still jumps up when I'm falling asleep - I feel the little bounce on the mattress. 
I didn't think I could love any cat as much as Tigger but I now have two lovely girls. They're so different, but I love them just as much. 

Sending love and hugs. Your girl is lucky to have such a good human."

And it's a fantastic series - it's definitely fantasy but I think you'd enjoy it as it's so brilliantly realised and the illustrations are stunning.

Very similar to Harry Potter in that there are young protagonists who stay the same throughout the series but others who come in as the series continues, the books become longer and more complex as you go through them and the protagonists grow up, they deal with a magical world which exists side by side with the real world and with people who are part of both, there is terrible danger and loss but also great humanity, there's a wise wizard at the heart of them, they deal with timeless themes and they're wonderfully imagined and written.
