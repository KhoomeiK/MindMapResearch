AmItheAsshole,fecdssd,t3_eo6j73,1578971531.0,"Gentle YTA, and this might be long, but please hear me out. 

While I’m not adopted, I was a donated egg- so I’m fully related to my dad, but not biologically to my mom. For a long time, I didn’t know, and when my parents chose to tell me (when I was 16) they told me that the donation was completely anonymous (per the organizing facility’s policies at the time) and that I would not be able to reach out to the woman who is 50% responsible for my existence. 

I’m 21 now, and while I can respect that I will probably never know who my donor is/was, it still irks me a little. Not because my parents haven’t treated me well (for the record, there are very few ways in which they could have treated me better- because of them, I’ve lived a relatively privileged life, throughout which I have been loved and supported unconditionally; I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that), but because I believe that I owe some gratitude to the person that gave my parents the ability to have me and who gave me the opportunity to have them. I would love to have her reach out, just so I knew who to send flowers to. 

That being said, I can see how that might bring you/your partner/your bio son some angst. Here you are, existing as a (hopefully and presumably) close-knit and solid family unit, when suddenly some random person shows up wanting either to actively disrupt that in some capacity, or to cause some disruption to the same effect. I’ve had enough tear-filled discussions with my mother to know that that has to feel threatening, and I can understand why you would never want your daughter to have any contact with the woman who gave birth to her at all, ever. 

But I would bet that she doesn’t want to make contact with that woman to throw the family into chaos. Either, like me, she just wants to say thanks, or, also like me, she realizes that biology and genetics aren’t nothing- for example, after taking a DNA test at 19, I discovered that I have a half brother, and some genetically hereditary medical vulnerabilities aside from the medical history provided by the fertility clinic that doctors wouldn’t have known to monitor otherwise. 

My point here is, support her. This whole situation isn’t easy for her either, and right now, you have the opportunity to show that you are always there for her, no matter what."

Anorexia is a serious mental problem, and people can die from it. Yeah, he might be looking for validation, but that’s because he’s not getting other (more effective) types of help for his problem, and hearing someone say he ISN’T fat may be the one thing that keeps that keeps him tethered to earth. 

I very nearly lost one of my best friends to anorexia twice in high school. I cannot believe you think that that was an acceptable thing to say.

Edit to add that he wasn’t blocking you, he was removing himself from a situation that wasn’t helping him. That was a move designed to be beneficial to both him and his friend group."
