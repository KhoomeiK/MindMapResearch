AskReligion,fgh0jvc,t3_exz1r2,1580773817.0,"I've thought about this quite a bit and I'd say yes we have choice. 

And I think God has left us evidence just in the world we live in. Science is a small way we peer into how things truly work. 

One of the tenants of math/science is law of probability. 

There is a probability something may occur, not a promise things may occur. 

So doing something as simple as flipping coins give us a random outcome every time, we know what the two choices can be, heads or tails, but we don't know what they will be each flip. 

If randomness didn't exist, then I'd say we don't have choice. 

But its a central tenant in my reigion that Agency, or power to choose, was the main gift God gave to this planet, and that after doing so he has not directly interfered much since for that very reason. 

And this explains perfectly, if God created this world, why things like Evolution exist. Mutation and corruption of form will happen in a world with agency and randomness thrown into it. God may have kickstarted the world, but isn't micromanaging it."

AskReligion,fggzddj,t3_evzeki,1580773017.0,"I will come out and say this comes from a Latter Day Saint (Mormon) view on things.

Now the core thing we are always taught. Is that every being has agency, or power over their own self choices. 

Now with that in mind, God doesn't send anyone anywhere. He allows us to choose. 

This all being said, we believe there are several kingdoms, and that it is not just heaven and hell. 

So you have the Celestial Kingdom, this is heaven, living with God, eternal progress and paradise.

There is the Terrestrial Kingdom, still a much better state of being then here or hell, but it is falling short of total glory/heaven proper in the Celestial, basically people who would be here are ones who learned what the true path was, but decided they liked where they are at and never chose to pursue it. They do NOT deserve hell, they were great people, but did not do what they needed to reach a celestial status, they chose it, and were slightly damned from progressing further. 

There is the Telestial Kingdom, this is much like earth, but like the other two kingdoms, has a measure of heavens glory and light, so people here still are given the gift of immortality after the resurrection Christ will perform when raising everyone in the final days for that final judgement. It will still be a good place, but the people that go here would be bad people.

And by bad I don't mean doing a bad thing, I mean doing bad things and not ever trying to improve or become aware of what they are doing is bad. 

So, your unrepentant murders, rapists, etc, will go here, forever damned from obtaining anything more then the bare minimum from Christ's sacrifice/atonement for mankind. 

If you notice, I didn't say this was hell. This is the biggest divergence from Christianity proper we teach in some ways. 

Outer Darkness is Hell. No light or love from God is felt or present here. Satan and his fallen angels reside here, and the only individuals cast here would likely be ones like Judas, ones who knew the truth exactly, and then lied and dragged others away. That is truly what makes Lucifer the devil, not some comical bloody landscape torturing people nor even that he tempts people away. He knows the truth perfectly, and uses that knowledge willingly to drag others down. 

Basically imagine a doctor going to school then lying to patients what they have to do to get better simply because he can and has a irrational hate for them. 

So at least in my religions view, precious few souls here on earth would ever qualify for ""hell""."

Man and his concubine visit tribe of Benjamin lands.

The man gets lodging with a resident there. Some men in town come to the house and demand the guest be given to them so they can ""know him"" which basically means they wanted to rape him. 

The homeowner says no and offers his daughter and the concubine instead. They refuse at first, but eventually the concubine is given. 

She is raped/abused all night and found dead on the doorstep the following morning.

The man she had been with cuts her into pieces and sends a piece to each tribe of israel, all of whome send soldiers to the tribe of Benjamin lands to find the rapists and execute them. Benjamin refuses and fights them in battle. 

Benjamin loses the fight badly and is basically decimated, to help them replenish numbers the other tribes who just got done beating them into the dust then proceed to go on raiding parties to kidnap women to give to the remnant of the tribe of Benjamin so they could rebuild and not go extinct."
