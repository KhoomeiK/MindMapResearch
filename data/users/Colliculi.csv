lookatthebrightside,fedfx7w,t3_eog27v,1579010442.0,"How stressful! For one, you are probably going to change your mind about careers several times.

My roommate changed her major 5 times when we were in school, and finally found what she wanted. Then, she did a month-long class overseas to help prepare her for grad school... and decided she doesn’t want to do that anyway. 

She’s now working a job she mostly likes, and enjoying her free time for hobbies. I’m sure she will end up somewhere else eventually, and that’s okay!

It may not be easy, but it’s okay to change your mind. You can always start college undeclared. Use high school classes to see what you like and dislike. I’m sorry there is so much pressure on you to decide so young. It’s crazy to me, but I know that this is the world we live in. Don’t worry too much - it’s more than okay to keep changing your mind."
nursing,fecgfad,t1_fe92b10,1578973302.0,That’s ridiculous.

And, agreeing with others: vitals machines, wheelchairs."
nursing,fecfin4,t3_eoajk8,1578972686.0,"I feel the same sometimes on my ortho unit. I’ll go skiing or ice skating but spend the whole time worrying that I’m going to get in a bad accident. 999 people go skiing and are just fine. The one I see ends up with an ex-fix for 6 months, infection, or amputation. 

Therapy helps, as does reminding myself that these accidents and complications are not common. It sounds like you are going through a lot - hang in there. I’m glad you are looking for help."
AskReddit,fealldk,t1_fe9gfvw,1578950123.0,I love that. Sometimes it really doesn’t come naturally.
offmychest,fe9ejs9,t3_eo4j99,1578936894.0,I love this.
AskReddit,fe9eeda,t3_eo7as2,1578936840.0,"I’m inspired by a post by u/omegagasp on r/OffYourChest:

“My therapist just blew my mind with saying,  ‘You deserve to stop punishing yourself.’



And here is one comment made by my therapist:

“Whatever you say about yourself is much louder and stronger than what others say about you.” That is, other people’s positive opinions of you can’t ever outweigh your negative opinions of yourself. You’ve got to learn to be nice to yourself!"
offmychest,fe5u9sn,t1_fe1szpu,1578875083.0,Thank goodness you had enough gas in your car to do that....

TrueOffMyChest,fdwuwz8,t3_en4yzt,1578762544.0,"I’m totally with you. My partner is so understanding and gentle. I still have similar feelings to those you described, but I am grateful to be with someone who cares to hear them. There is definitely hope of finding a good partner."
CompulsiveSkinPicking,fdwh86g,t1_fdv5on6,1578758660.0,That’s amazing! It’s great to hear how you looked for answers and how to better approach her with all of this. She’s lucky to have you.
AnimalCrossing,fdwgon5,t1_fdw1e9t,1578758468.0,Thank you!

PlasticSurgery,fdh4s4g,t3_el96c3,1578415371.0,"If you aren’t sure what you want, I don’t think you should get any surgeries. Maybe try counseling/therapy to help you with your low self-esteem. Best of luck to you."
offmychest,fdf1v57,t1_fdeyr5q,1578351405.0,"Here’s the thing - you are assuming that praying is all I am doing. It’s not. I agree that prayer alone is not much to offer. Prayer without any personal action or donation (so long as the person is capable of doing so) falls short. 

I spoke up here because some are arguing that prayer, in general, ought to be avoided. You are absolutely right that God (and humanity, really) calls us to action."
offmychest,fdeib9q,t1_fdeggpc,1578339631.0,"Why can’t I do both? Why must I choose? My time praying does not take away from my time at work or volunteering. It comes from my time getting ready in the morning, from my time sleeping at night, or from time I might have spent watching television. I’m sure you will say that this is a weak argument, but then I will ask you how much time you spend at home relaxing, or playing video games. How much time you spend deep in conversation on reddit. 

It’s not fair to say that I spend time praying instead of making the world a better place. It’s not a trade-off this way."
offmychest,fdehr8z,t1_fdecoi0,1578339291.0,"No, nothing is literally the least I can do. 

I’m not saying that it is immediately worth more than doing anything else, and I know that my donations make a much more immediate and direct impact on this terrible situation. 

I’m saying that I should not feel bad for doing both. My prayers are not meaningless and they are not worthless. Honestly, they often don’t make me feel any better. But I’ve got to pray because I believe that it can help, and whether it does (today, tomorrow, a week from now) is irrelevant because it is worth doing. Sitting with the grief and the pain of this, however small mine may be in comparison to those actually affected, is worth doing."
offmychest,fde8xbz,t1_fde6rui,1578333768.0,"I would argue that in many times, this is untrue. I know that my prayers without my actions do not somehow count as me “doing something productive to help.”

However, I still believe it is worth praying because I do believe that God can step in. I can’t tell you why he hasn’t, yet. I am so deeply sorry for all that is happening. The pain, the fear, the torture. But I am praying because that’s the biggest thing I can do. It is not the only thing worth doing, and I expect no praise or reward from it, but it is worth my time."
CompulsiveSkinPicking,fck9c7r,t3_ehmvvs,1577720075.0,"You’re doing great! I’m a bit inspired, tbh.
I always chew the dry skin off my lips and it just makes them hurt and raw. Leaving them alone as well as your cold sores is no small thing. Keep it up!"
AMA,fcjho35,t1_fci5oiv,1577687970.0,Thanks Emma. What are the pros and cons for you?
nursing,fchbcew,t1_fch2e30,1577648939.0,Yeah... I’m afraid of that. My friend got a tib/fib fx in our second month and had to drop out. She had to fight like hell to get in to the next year’s cohort. I was hoping that was a lonely case.

nursing,fcg5c3r,t3_eh4w09,1577636620.0,"No, but many people do. I did search a few journal articles a month ago to try to decide if it’s actually safe... results seemed to vary a bit but hedges on the side of “safer not to wear it.”

I did find that chipped polish is more likely to gather bacteria than intact polish... but all polish is a bit of a risk."
nursing,fcg3ngt,t1_fcd26fd,1577636225.0,"I would call the school and see if it’s possible to delay a year - if you were accepted this year, why wouldn’t they let you switch? This can help you to gather all of your options and make an informed decision."
nursing,fcfvkez,t1_fcbho26,1577634154.0,I never would have thought of it this way. Thank you for your compassion and your perspective.
