I agree digestible but not with convincing. It's just information that agrees with their predisposition. To be educated is to be willing to learn. The willingness to learn is let one's ego be hurt.

The misfiring gets worse when you’re dumping a lot of the wrong fuel (WOT). 

The problem with the wrong fuel is it will detonate either before or after it should (hence misfire). By using the wrong octane you decrease power (you feel more at high rpm) and mpg (because of the fuel detonating). 

It may cost $5 more/tank but it’s cheaper than throwing parts at it. Plus you’ll be running the car at the correct specs.

This is how the false stereotype of German cars and reliability gets roots. At least you admit you beat on it when you shouldn’t.
