\- A small amount of bloom to enhance the core light.  
\- Break the lines on the base, way too sharp for realism. Add some small beveling.  
\- The copper coils are almost flat, maybe it's just the camera/light and the detail is not visible, but if there is none I would recommend adding at least some generated texture with lines to them, when you have a single object on camera every detail is important.

>Forcing a game to clean after itself when it's leaking memory makes it go faster anyway

First: It doesn't, thats not how programs works. ""Forcing them to clean after itself"" is making the whole process memory dump to disk, only to be loaded back again when you go back to that program, that's the oposite of making it go faster.

Second: programs can't freely access other processes memory and magically guess what is garbage or not, that's not how these ""magic memory"" programs work. They just call a huge allocation to Windows and Windows dumps all other programs ram to disk, that's not the same as garbage collection, at all.

Third: If you are having blue screens of death because of what you call a ""memory leak"" (if it's even that) then you have some kind of hardware issue like a faulty ram module, or have your swap file (also known as ""virtual memory"" in windows) set to something too low, that has literally nothing to do with garbage collection."

A single bounce at 25 does sounds more balanced to me, but then again it's not very original... we already have medusa, clinks, drow (aghs) and luna with some sort of multi attack or bounce thing, without counting the other ranged heroes that also have aoe type damage or not 100% uptime (od, pa, gyro, snapfire, etc)Keeping certain heroes focused on ranged autos, single target damage makes for more interesting draft decision in my opinion.

BTW, impetus has a max attack range bonus, and it's really easy to cap now with the new spoink skill and dragon lance. Anyways, if quiver isn't considered broken on her it's because the hero is trash in general this meta, [but it's still a very good item for her](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/5202446908?guide=f15e46)."

Glaives bouncing with his attack range+dragon lance already sounds like he would be a better version of Luna. Don't forget glaives are 75% pure damage of his int and steal 3 int per hit, this would be a ridiculous boost for him in teamfights for a lvl20 talent.  


I'm not going to say range at lvl20 is the best talent an hero can have, but that already has like 83% pickrate over the other talent, it has good synergy with glaives, his base range and dragon lance, and if you find something like Enchanted Quiver in the jungle the hero starts to look like a Sniper on steroids."

It's actually the other way around, Indie Pogo has user defined tags in the store but doesn't have the developer category of ""Shared/Split Screen Co-op"" set by the developers in the steamworks feature list.

Not exactly I understand what you are asking for, a separate way to add those developer categories into filters? I'm not against the idea, but you should already have Indie Pogo in that list if you use the store filters for ""local multiplayer"" or you can always add manually the missing games in the category (even for dynamic filter lists)"
Steam,ff290ni,t1_ff1syku,1579497352.0,"No it doesn't, having more free memory doesn't make your computer faster, not writing to disk is what does, when Windows is running out of memory is when this operations are necesary, not right away. Besides, it's up to the program itself to manage it's garbage collection, not always Windows, overriding that logic is basically forcing those programs to reload to resources again when they are needed. This is not garbage collection, it's writting memory to swap.

How this programs work is basically telling them Windows is out of memory so they all write to disk the least important cache. You could already do that in windows 95 with a vbe script of one line code telling it to asign a big variable, that would get freed when the script finishes:

`mystring=(80000000)`

That's it, the program requested a space Windows doesn't have, and all your other programs write to swap (disk) their non-vital ram memory, basically what hibernating your PC does to not lose the data.

As to why would someone pay money to do what you can already by double clicking that script, I have no idea. This is not good for your HDD life and is done by Windows anyways when it's out of memory.

So yes, Windows is smart enough to do it, in fact they wrote the language that script runs on (Visual Basic) and yet don't include an user button to do that because they know better.

Edit: The linked github memory app works very similarly, I just read the code and all it does is draw giant completely transparent images to fill your RAM and let Windows do what it always does."

Vaporwave comes from music, so there's nothing clear cut, but it seems to me from looking at the pictures that people asociate with it that there is a lot of typical forms (like the grids, the lowpoly mountains, sunsets, palm trees, ""simulation effects"", chromatic aberration or distortion etc) and the most prominent colors seems to be combinations of purple/magic pink and blue/teal as complementary with orange as accent color. Neon is the most common, gradients are very popular too.

I find it weird that people asociate vaporwave with this pastel color scheme, considering it's much older, perhaps the flat colors looks similar to people with color blindness, if we ignore all the other more important stylistic cues?  


Edit: Nvm, I see what you mean, the wikipedia definition of vaporwave and synthwave (what you call outrun and I didn't asociate with the game when I read it) are quite different from what I see in the linked sub and my search results. So maybe it's a case of a warped definition of the word in popular culture context."
