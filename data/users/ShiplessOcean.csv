detrans,ffpx9ij,t1_ffpwgix,1580109399.0,"The problems you listed apply to ftmtf too, with others on top. Forgive me for my ignorance but are there any extra long lasting problems that are unique to mtftm, that cannot be solved by detransing, additional to the ones that are faced by detrans of both sexes? (Body change, libido change, body hair change, fertility loss.) 

While I can imagine those are difficult to deal with and will certainly impact your relationships, “at least” you can always be read as your desired sex/gender in every situation from the outside perspective. Imagine being a ftmtf and knowing that the moment you open your mouth you will “out” yourself as a sex/gender you never were, anticipating the shocked (at best) look on people’s faces, in every public situation from job interviews to first dates to just buying something in a shop, plus since transwomen are at higher risk of violence, as a woman with a deep voice it’s more dangerous. I know it’s not a competition and the two experiences shouldn’t be compared, I’m just bringing one perspective to the reason why people might feel more sorry for ftmtf. Women are already disadvantaged in society, now they will have a load of extra shit to deal with."
detrans,ffpvhpg,t3_euh20h,1580107282.0,"Without taking bottom surgery into account for either case, from what I can tell it seems easier to detransition back to a man than detrans back to a woman. There are more traumatic permanent physical changes for ftmtf like the voice change and facial hair that they will have to deal with forever. This could be why their experience garners more sympathy"

detrans,ffhqwwi,t3_etnjml,1579949164.0,"I have to add to what others have said. When you say walking into a room and being read as a woman makes you extraordinarily happy, what about being read as a transwoman? Also, have you ever tried crossdressing, like actually leaving the house dressed head to toe as a woman and running daytime errands, not as a joke or costume party. I feel like that would give you a good idea of what it’ll be like post transition. FFS might make you feel differently about your own body image but will only make a marginal differences to how you’re read."

Including right down to ruining the lives of innocent people. The argument is that, it isn’t their job, they’re not trained, leave it to the experts. But it happens all the time where police and media get sued for accusing/investigating the wrong person. The fact is that if the police cared more about animal torture and listened to the sleuths then they could have stopped Magnotta before he killed Lin"

television,ffbrasj,t1_ffbircj,1579779643.0,"I mean, we’re assuming he wanted to be a serial killer. If he only wanted to kill one person and recreate that film scene, he did it and didn’t lose anything by getting “caught out”. He really wanted fame, that’s why he left hints and eventually outed himself to the fb group. To say he’s sloppy suggested he wanted to get away with it and made mistakes"
television,ffbr4ya,t3_esj8n0,1579779444.0,"Contrary to popular opinion, I feel that the internet sleuths deserved to be mentioned in that documentary. This was not their job, they had their own job and full lives to lead every day, but the situation caught their attention because of their care for animals. A lot of us can identify with that. And they worked tirelessly and made themselves to sit through the horrific upsetting footage over and over again in the quest to stop this guy. Similar to members of the justice system that have to watch indecent images and footage of minors in those type of cases. I have serious respect and gratitude for them. 


Even though the sleuths didn’t crack the case, if the police or Interpol had listened to the sleuths earlier then Lin would not have had to lose his life. To people saying the documentary should’ve been called “don’t kill people” and comments along the lines of “who cares about animals what about the human death” I feel the biggest takeaway for me was that maybe the police should take animal torture more seriously and treat cases like this as an international concern since it often, if not always, leads to human consequence."
