OCD,ff7xln4,t1_ff7ouop,1579660764.0,"Don’t you apologize! This is a place to vent your emotions and talk to people about your struggles. I’m sorry it’s that bad for you. It is for me too. It’s been happening to me since I was a young kid. It gets in the way of life and destroys it. To me it sounds like you have OCD and I would go see a professional about it. Keep one thing in mind. If they say you don’t, and you feel you do, ask for a second opinion. You are always entitled to ask for a second opinion, and if they say you don’t then you probably don’t. This disease never gets better, but you get better at coping. Please seek help because you deserve it. You deserve to feel better. If you want to talk to me about OCD more you can PM me."
OCD,ff7d7vs,t1_ff6tmn1,1579646847.0,"I’m not a professional, but considering I had/have that as an intrusive thought, that’s OCD. Only if it’s a loop that won’t stop and keeps you from living your life peacefully."

bipolar,fet5jq6,t1_fepdwih,1579372021.0,Stay safe I know how dangerous mine were. Mixed episodes suck. You can work through it though. I believe in you.
bipolar,fepp974,t1_fepo4uu,1579326776.0,Reddit can be amazing for this exact reason. Realizing you’re not alone.
