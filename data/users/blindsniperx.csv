They made 30% of their profits off of late fees, and Netflix (plus this new program) made late fees a thing of the past. They put restrictions on it to get people to start paying late fees again, while Netflix was transitioning to being a streaming service.

Once movies went digital, the idea of physical rentals died."
technology,ff6oj0w,t1_ff5o3bd,1579631584.0,"I was talking about ordinary documents, not full size photos. Although I suppose if one were printing photos while taking advantage of the free 15 prints per month, they could have a savings of about $75 per month in that case!

We'd always tell customers the sub-$100 printers weren't meant for photos though, and try to upsell them on $130 ""photosmart"" printers that could not take advantage of the free 15 plan."
technology,ff478bq,t1_ff3ptzu,1579557061.0,"I used to work for HP, so I can answer this one here. On printers less than $100, we offered a ""free"" instant ink subscription of 15 pages per month. As long as you never print more than 15, you would get a free set of cartridges. Our cartridges print 200 pages, so they would essentially last the customer an entire year. The kinds of customers who got this were little old ladies who said they usually never print anything except for something very occasional.

The kicker here is that if they go over 15 pages, which is very easy to do if they have to suddenly print a lot that month, they are charged $1 per 10 pages after that automatically. We then aggressively offer the $2.99 plan, which allows 50 pages per month. Then the clincher is that you can NEVER downgrade back to the free 15 page plan once you exit it and enter the 50 page plan. You are stuck unless you buy a new printer that carried the same free offer.

And the thing is, the sub-$100 printers were all designed to be trash. They print slow, have errors and problems to frustrate the user, and cease working within 2 years almost guaranteed. So HP is not losing money on this. It is just a tactic to get people to pay overage fees or upgrade to a higher paid tier.

The funny part is that it costs only about 2 to 5 cents a page to print at the local office supply store where they BOUGHT the printer. It costs less than $10 to print the equivalent number of yearly pages from the printing center in the store. Buying a printer for your home, to be used for so few pages, is just a rip off that HP wants to make a profit on."

Animemes,fehqwnt,t1_feh9qle,1579122087.0,"It was so bad. People need to take off the Avatar (TLA) nostalgia goggles when watching it. It was a trash show for many reasons:

1. Korra is unlikeable. She is so over-the-top defensive around everyone to the point of annoyance. It makes you think, does anyone even like this chick? Why does she act like such an ass? The writers were going for ""strong female lead"" but these personality traits completely undermine that.

2. Aang's kids do not represent Aang in any way. They should be valuable mentors to Korra, but instead they're a bunch of useless good for nothings. Then they try to make Aang's grandkids represent Aang, but they have no impact on Korra's growth whatsoever.

3. Speaking of growth, the entire thing felt rushed. It just felt like Korra starts off strong and ends the show at the same strength level. It seemed as though the show was just an excuse to show Aang's friends post-time skip like with their descendants and Toph.

4. It took a HUGE dump on the lore, I mean completely ruining the great world building we had in the original. First they ""restart"" the Avatar cycle so she can't talk to any of the past avatars, which was one of the COOLEST things in the original. Why remove something so pivotal like that? Then they show flashbacks of Aang anyway, despite getting rid of this ability earlier. And the worst part was the whole spirit world thing, with ancient entities being involved and making the concept of the ""Avatar"" irrelevant. So stupid.

5. It felt like watching a bad fanfiction. Honestly it's an insult to the original.

Contrast that with Aang and his crew from the original show, who were all strong but had flaws they had overcome."

On a more serious note, technological literacy is not actually needed in the government. Yes they *should* be literate, but let me explain why it's not a problem.

Our government representatives and senators enact legislation (pass laws) proposed by their constituents. Constituents are the people they represent. (They were elected by the people that live in their area.) So the technological illiterate people in congress (a major branch of government) do not just randomly make up laws on their own. Before they pass laws, there is a description explaining what it is. So even if a congressman don't know the technology, the people who voted and drafted the law do know the technology, so at the stage where a congressman votes to pass it is just to see if it passes the test of law. If it does not fit with the current laws, then it usually will not pass. Also, any person in the United States can call their representatives and senators and let them know if they don't like a bill that is currently being voted on. It's simple and fair to all who participate in our democracy.

This is why the US is run largely by lawyers who KNOW THE LAW, so it benefits the most people because it satisfies their want for the proposed law.

Tell me this: do engineers and scientists know how to pass laws that won't conflict or interfere with people's lives? Do they have any negotiating expertise at all? And if they don't require votes to make changes in laws, why are you guys letting them ruin the country of China for their own benefit and exploitation? Communist countries may get things done, but it's at the expense and suffering over nearly a billion people to benefit just a few lucky dudes."

There must be a very tight window for this to happen, but since Wispy blinks a lot it became well known. For the PAL fix, they must have assigned Wispy's blinking to a different space in memory."

Best thing I could say is remember it is a city planning game. You will need to hit the pause time button and think about what to build or do next. This makes for a much calmer experience, even on the hardest difficulty. It can be very rewarding to work through a problem and solve it successfully.

The game is designed so you can't accomplish everything you want at once. You have to be more methodical and prioritize one choice at a time. The fun part is that there are branching ways you can do this and there is no one set way to solve it.

I do feel however that some paths are easier than others, and I tend to stick to the same choices that I feel are safer and more advantageous. So trial and error is your friend. Half the fun is experimenting what you can do in this game."

It was much later on after he became president of the company where he said he couldn't get back into programming now because he'd need to spend extensive time learning all the changes, new coding language, etc. because the industry evolved around him as he aged.

He then made sure he would instead try and guide Nintendo on the right path financially, while being a mentor to every team that worked at Nintendo. His job was still to min-max profits, but at least he tried it in an honest way.

science,fck42p3,t1_fck1mjp,1577715985.0,"Another wrinkle is that aerosols are actually causing global dimming, which provides a cooling effect by preventing rays from entering the Earth to warm it up. This has lowered the Earth's temperature by half a degree, while CO2 has raised the temperature by 1.5 degrees. This has balanced out to the current 1 degree increase, not including other factors.

With ice ages it can be bright and cool at the same time. Now we are headed to a dim age which has worse implications for life on the planet.

It was recently discovered that bees are dying out because of the dimming. Since plants are not getting the same amount of energy from the sun anymore, they don't produce enough nutrients in their nectar for bees to feed on. As a result, seemingly healthy bee colonies collapse suddenly due to the fallout of prolonged malnutrition.

Then with humans, even slight increases in CO2 cause significant drops in brain function. At 1000ppm there is a 15% decrease in cognitive ability. Before industrialization natural areas were at about 300ppm. Now most natural areas globally are at 400ppm. That means there has been a global decrease in intelligence by 2% in the ""fresh air"" areas of the world. In urban areas it hits 500ppm and indoors it can go even higher, leading to a 4-5% decrease in thinking ability in developed civilization.

I know you're probably going to ask me for sources, and they are out there, but the point of my post is that there are so many variables at play you really can't predict for certain how the effect will play out. It seems right now, that even if temperatures remain stable, we have simply made the world worse for all life regardless. Temperature is actually one of our least worries. The cascading death of animals and decreased brain activity of humans is going to kill us before any weather event will."

smashbros,fcbbhxi,t1_fc8q8zn,1577584835.0,"I was actually super interested in this so I watched Grands Paseriman vs Shuton and then I watched a random game of Light vs Shuton, just to compare.

It seems like Paseriman is way better at managing to not get hit by Olimar. Like he will shine in the air to prevent the dreaded Olimar upairs, and he will land with nair or dair and follow up every time with an up tilt or dash attack. Then I noticed he likes being under Olimar so he can threaten him with Upsmash that literally ignores Olimar's dair so Shuton actually seems like he can't land vs Fox.

Then I watch Light and he is getting chain comboed by Shuton, can't land, gets hit a bunch of times and it's Olimar at 12% vs Fox at 98% in seconds. It seems like Light is trying to do all the right moves with dtilt to fair, nair spam to kill the pikmin and combo to upsmash, etc. I feel like the biggest difference is that Light stays in the air too long and becomes combo food while Paseriman is smashing that stick to fast fall and stay on the ground as  much as possible."

The power balance is that the states can also do whatever they want. Do you know how many states already made weed legal? They can remove the age requirement and give cigs/beer to toddlers too if they wanted.

It's a general guideline. If the drinking ages were different in each state, then the fed gov using blackmail to make them all raise it to 21 was to achieve conformity in the law. Drinking has been a hot-button issue legally since the days of prohibition, so the gov does not fuck around when it comes to drinking laws.

Smoking is a bit different but these two vices go hand in hand (literally) and should have both been age-gated to 21 from the start. I don't see the gov being as strict on it as alcohol, but most states will conform to 21 now that the guideline has been set in place."

Buying vehicles/houses, signing contracts, and getting a loan would be troublesome if you *couldn't* do so at age 18. Also getting into the military is a career choice. Should people be banned from dangerous professions until 21? There are more implications than you think.

Getting to ruin your health by drinking/smoking shouldn't be as easy. Like it or not, a higher age-gate is the smartest choice."
