I stopped, not never wanted to start, but I wanted to find out if the person I’m going over the top for and not getting it on return with loyalty is worth me pouring my soul out for.

AskMen,fel2tph,t1_fel2ci1,1579212843.0,"oh compliments, name calling, asking about everything, voice memos, kissies memos and hearts, bla bla, implying meeting especially while he’s traveling . 

So it’s not like a suspected thing, it’s a 100% flirting fact and is worse when his feelings are down (I think he’s needing reaffirmation). 

Now it’s just sketchy, he’s texting (I don’t know how much, I’ve just seen a memo to her recently after he saw this girl for her bday and said she looked super great that night and sends her a kiss at the end of the memo) she called him baby when he asked if he could come to her bday, and I didn’t get to go since he was feeling “weird” that night.

Now his phone password is new, and I’ve seen her name recently when he showed me something in his phone, and I’m scared. 

I’m trying to worry about myself at this point, starting today, because my anxiety and depression got so strong due to constant worrying and fantasizing what is or could be happening, that I really thought I wouldn’t make it out of each day.  

Crazy how a deep connection to someone can make you worry and care so much to the point where I feel.. crazy? 

For many logical reasons but blah."
AskMen,fel2asi,t1_fel1r9w,1579212517.0,"clear history of flirting even in his previous relationship, and the girls are definitely playing their part too. im just confused if they’re aware of our relationship. 

words such as baby, (fake) but indented meet ups, wanting to cuddle or simply and plainly say I want to fuck you if someone posts a hot picture. (This was a few months ago) but I’ve definitely found some evidence (sadly that I’ve even come to that point) of him name calling girls and just saying the kind of things I would dig to hear. 

shit like that, could get worse, but there’s so many instances to explain , but blah"

AskMen,fel1bia,t1_fel0so9,1579211919.0,"right?! thing is, I moved across the world for him, so thought things were so super serious & ive dedicated everything for this love, BUT when I even arrived I arrived to a scene of finding out he had a girlfriend until I moved here, where he called off things with her. All in “good intentions” so no one got hurt. I think it’s when he’s hurting he reaches out to outside sources who are fresh, and flirt and since he’s cute and very into a creative world it’s easy to be attracted to, but like blah! come on.. 

Just needed to reach out and make sure that my mind isn’t playing tricks on me to be the victim, guess it’s tru"
AskMen,fel0xdq,t1_fel0k5n,1579211686.0,"right?! when I first found out (with many girls) there was just denial and anger, which he’s sensible so it’s not anything violent just more like retracting from me for a while, but I recently heard something disturbing to my trust as a voice memo from a girls birthday party he attended, and I’ve seen he’s changed his phone password and have seen her name pop up in messages recently. I moved across the world for this guy, but im starting to think I need to be wise or else I’ll sink. 

I’ve figured out you can’t / shouldn’t change someone to fit to what you feel is right, if they’re not thinking that the wrong things they’re doing are wrong. 

lots of info, but crazy right? hes a good guy, but sigh"
