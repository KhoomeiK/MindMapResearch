Abusing a position of authority implies that there is mental or physical coercion happening. 
The idea that any unequal authority is an abuse of authority is just plain false. The law is so black and white because it’s an attempt to prevent those situations that are an abuse of power. That’s why an 18yr old high schooler and a 23yr old teacher can’t be in a relationship and it’s considered an abuse of authority, even if the teacher is not using their position of authority to coerce the student.

I’m not saying teachers should be allowed to have relationships with students. It’s for the best that we have the laws the way they are. I’m saying that what the laws says is happening, and what’s actually happening, are not necessarily the same thing.

When I was in high school, I was in a relationship with a girl in her mid 20’s, she wasn’t in a direct position of power over me, but most of society would still have condemned her and happily destroyed her life if they had found out.

There are just as many policies within both parties that are detrimental to the health and prosperity of America."
