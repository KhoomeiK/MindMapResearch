The reason for the law is because the first amendment protections don't apply on government property, which is what allows the government to disallow foul language on the stand, it's a misdemeanor offense. Similar principles apply in the chambers of Congress, people who give testimony are bound by those rules. Congress keeps a separate set of more strict policies for themselves, for instance they can't attack other Congresspeople while in session, which is why we hear speech like, ""People in this room would have you believe _____,"" rather than, ""Congressman McConnel is a lying turtle.""

In a year where Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets came out with their establishing shot at the beginning, I was hoping to see something like that, but tonally fitting this universe. Valerian's opening sequence had more of a story to it than this entire film, and neither were any less predictable than the other despite one being about 10 minutes long and the other being a full-length movie.

The green armor looks flat. Highlights or blending in some colors, even just a little bit to give it depth, will go a long way.

Your bright colors are all over the place, and that can work, but think about where you want the focal point of the model to be. Usually that's the face, and you have a pretty remarkable face here. If that's something you want, you should probably tone down the sword a bit, just glaze over with your midtone blue and give smaller white highlights than you currently have. It will still look sharp, but it will be far less distracting. 

Last thing I'm seeing is the super high contrast of the red and green is giving off a Christmas vibe. If that's the goal, that's great, but if it's not, you could drift into an orange or purple to mellow it out.

television,ff3037r,t1_ff2un1w,1579530039.0,">In 2002 trump said Jeff was a great guy that likes women as much as he does, but Jeff likes them younger. Hes hosted and attended plenty of events with jeff Epstein, and has a history of touching women without their consent. Big shock. Clinton took a mission trip to Africa with epstein and kevin spacey and then a few more mission trips with jeff after that.

All of these are facts. No one contests them, but none of them are incriminating either. None of this is evidence of wrongdoing. It's possible Trump saw Epstein with women he thought were 18-20. It's possible Clinton and Spacey just went to Africa for an actual mission trip. Believe it or not, even people who grab their intern's crotch aren't ALWAYS taking people, or engaging under age people. Also, Spacey is notoriously into young men, but the only underage allegation hasn't been persued and Spacey himself said he doesn't remember it, but apologized anyway. That's not behavior consistent with pedophiles or rapists. 

I'm not saying anyone did or didn't do anything, what I'm saying is this collection of facts doesn't point to anything sexual. Being around bad people doesn't mean you knew what they were doing, and it definitely doesn't mean you were engaged in it. 

> A lot of awful things happen to kids during these types of trips because it is much less likely that abusers would ever be caught. 

Now you're inserting conjecture. Princess Diana went on these trips all the time. So did Angelina Jolie. That doesn't make them sexual tourists.

>That's a little more than a used car you happened upon, that sounds like participation or turning a blind eye.

You haven't shown anything like that at all. 

1. Trump made an off color statement and went to parties. But no one has ever alleged he was seen at those parties exhibiting any certain behavior. His ""history of touching women"" consists of a self-reported brag to a bro reporter about women at his pageant consenting to his grabbing them - a completely separate scenario - and women who have reported that he touched them only after he became president, but still declined to pursue any legal action. I'm not saying he's a saint, but if you're just going to take everyone at their word, I have some prime beachfront property in Oklahoma to sell you.

2. Clinton participating in outreach programs with the man is the *exact* same as the used car example. Adjacency to a crime doesn't make you a criminal. The fact that another person is a sexual tourist doesn't make you one for going to the same places, or are you calling Princess Diana a sexual tourist?

> You being apologetic or downplaying these associations with the worlds most notorious pedophile actually makes my stomach turn

Turns out at his hearing, the state had a subpoena for his bank record and they showed no checks ever cashed by the State.

The vast majority of people in jail are people who  broke the law and thought they could get away with it, and when they couldn't, they just lied, thinking they could bend reality if they buried their head deep enough in the sand. They're the people who argue with the cop that they weren't speeding when they knew they were. The pepple who now though red lights and then pick a fight about it being yellow. Where people got DUI's after drinking just one beer! It's the place where all the ""the world is out to get me for being a good person"" people wind up.

Blizzard,fehjmq7,t1_fefw49f,1579117890.0,"Blizzard has changed a *LOT* through the years as well. Are we talking 1990's Blizzard? That died with WoW's success, where the company shifted to a far more family-friendly format. SC2 D3, HotS, Hearthstone, and Overwatch have been aesthetically tuned to go for wide audiences where Warcraft: OvH, Diablo, D2, and SC:BW were all about the 13-30 demographic. 

That's not knocking it, it's just what happened. A lot of shifts in aesthetic happened in video games during the 00's. Gritty, edgy, and dark was out of fashion. D4 looks like it might be carving out some space to return to their 1990's aesthetic, which obviously makes sense to do it with their least entrenched franchise. Immortal looks a lot more like D3 Mobile, so it's not surprising that it is still more widely appealing. OW2 doesn't seem to be departing at all from their wide appeal.

My straight answer? There's no such thing as ""Acti-Blizzard"". There have been suits involved in Blizzard as a company since the 90's. Being in video game development at any company is a sacrifice, and Blizzard treats their employees pretty damn well compared to the field, e.g.the entire office takes almost a month off in December.

Also, we saw people condemning Trump for not believing the intelligence agencies and undermining them, but now that we have intelligence saying Soleimani was planning on attacking, we want to throw that out for another convenient source. It's possible he was planning those attacks *and* meeting Saudi Arabia, *and* there's definitely no definitive information that he was going to affirm some sort of deescalation.

television,fcvriy0,t1_fcvmf9i,1578008472.0,">Your comment still only exists from a western ethnocentric viewpoint. 

No, the internet has improved life globally. Trillions more have a coffee today because of the internet. Before that, phones connected people in a way never before possible. We can fucking hear the voices of a person*on the other side of the planet*, that does not exclusively belong to the West. I can talk to my grandmother in China from the US. The West has not unilaterally benefitted from electricity, a direct development of the Industrial Revolution.

>If you were to weigh everything that came about from everything you said in sheer pluses and minuses to the whole of mankind would you say the industrial revolution is without a doubt a gain to the world? 

Absurdism. You can't possibly calculate the good and evil of something that's echoes are not yet complete. Asking this question before and after any individual development that is derived from the IR changes your outlook completely. 

>Never mind that quality of life and happiness trends lower in modern society than present day primitive agrarian and hunter gatherer societies. Or the damage it does to the environment. 

Fucking completely false and unquantifiable. People dying of measles, small pox, the flu, contracting polio, were not fucking happier dying in pain. 

>And your point about wealth distribution makes no sense. The IR led to the worst wealth distribution in the history of western society because the need for skilled labor had vanished, which led to lower pay and less available work for low status workers.

COMPLETELY false, and you claim I have a blind spot? Slavery was fucking legal before the IR, and the possibility of *ending* slavery only existed because of the upward mobility provided in Western culture. You claim other cultures had it better before? India's caste system ring a bell? Freedom and Democracy weren't even a concept before the industrial revolution. Tonnes of people were still serfs until the 19th century. 

>And the internet you praise is in a dim state with privacy violations littered across its landscape and a total lack of easily accessible, uncompromised sites for discussion.

You complain about ""privacy violations"" while touting an age where people were property. Get the fuck off your podium. The internet viewing a tiny sliver of things you personally choose to put out there, wittingly or otherwise, is *MAGNITUDES* better than being a fucking slave.

>I'm also a citizen of the west. I get to enjoy the privilege of new technology and cushy living spaces. I choose that because it is convenient. That is called privilege.

Your assumption that I'm a ""citizen of the West"" is inversely as bigoted and short-sighted as your stupid argument is long. Claiming life is worse for people you've never fucking met and can't even conceive of their culture is so ""white privilege"" it makes me want to vomit.

>But the flipside of my privilege is that for centuries it has hurt millions of people that i cant possibly see or know to enjoy that privilege. And that's the darker side of industrialization and globalization that doesn't get discussed and is all I meant. 

No, it hasn't. And you don't get to ""claim"" the Industrial Revolution as your own because some people who share your skin color were major players in it centuries ago. You didn't do anything, you arrogant ass. You ""feel bad"" while sitting in your ivory castle typing on Reddit? Then go fucking be in the country you feel bad for and make a difference or shut the fuck up. You're belittling people you've never met by claiming your life is better than theirs, and that they live in misery. Most people don't. People in Western countries have far more social and mental disorders than those in Eastern countries.

>And me saying the printing press might be the greatest invention of mankind shouldn't be so controversial.

That's not all you fucking said, and claiming that isn't just disingenuous, it's a flat out lie. It wasn't ""the greatest invention ever"", the wheel has changed *so much more* than books, and allowed the Printing Press to exist.

This is the last I'm replying to you. You put words in my mouth, you disdain other cultures with faux pity, and you then feign innocence. You've lied and attempted to con your way out of your original statement. I won't waste more time arguing with someone who clearly believes that widespread slavery and disease was more just than the problems of today."
