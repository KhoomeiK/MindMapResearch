Can you ask your therapist? He or she is probably knowledgeable about these kinds of personality styles and how to best deal with them to not make them more upset. 
It sucks that you should have to even consider these kinds of strategies at 17.  I really do wish you the best life!"

In the morning he filmed it as it came running back over some fields. His dog had befriended another dog and it came running with him. Maybe even two dogs? Such a fun video.

Edit: The video was posted in r/unexpected and the dog actually came back with another dog and a GOAT!!"
