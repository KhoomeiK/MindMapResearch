worldpolitics,ff8dzu0,t1_ff8bhvd,1579674511.0,"A conservative can be smart; a conservative can be well-informed; a conservative can be moral; but a conservative can’t be all three. 

If you go to Harvard, the correct self-interested choice is to be conservative. Once you have power, maintaining the current structure you’ve flourished in solidifies it.

Writing a book praising a person who has deliberately weakened the fight against climate change, sought diviseness, and bred hatred is an immoral act, even if it takes a well-informed point of view to be convincing.

Pessimism isn’t inherently immoral, but it can skew one’s perception of reality and tends to demotivate. If a liberal’s pessimism towards corporations causes a disdain for the corporation, what does a conservative’s pessimism toward their fellow man cause?"
worldpolitics,ff867vd,t1_ff6ml8p,1579667129.0,"Socialist is a difficult to define term, but I would 100% agree with with statement that anyone who is smart, well-informed, and has morals is liberal/progressive. For that, Harvard does a survey every year of graduating seniors, and 65.38% of respondents identify as liberal or very liberal compared to 9.43% who identify as conservative or very conservative. [Source](https://features.thecrimson.com/2019/senior-survey/national-politics/)

Regardless of survey data, it’s easy to reason out by looking at the core beliefs of the left and right.

Moral:
Liberalism views people as naturally altruistic, and conservatism views people as naturally self-serving. Your view of society and the people that make it up is ultimately a reflection of how you view yourself.

Smart:
Liberalism values progress over stasis. Conservatism values the wisdom of the past. Human intelligence and knowledge has consistently improved over time. It’s correct to value new insights over the tested practice of the past."

personalfinance,fewm45d,t3_eqqixl,1579414274.0,"I’m going to go against the grain here and say you likely don’t need to save, if you are confident that (1) your parents will be able to cover any emergency expenses and (2) you will receive a high-paying job out of college that allows you to save enough for retirement.

My answer is based on the idea of [consumption snoothing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumption_smoothing). Right now, you are making a relatively low amount of money compared to your average lifetime income. Because of this, you’ll be spending things on more essential items that bring you more enjoyment. If your interested in maximizing the enjoyment you receive, you should try to spend the same amount of money at all points in your life. This means spending more in times of low income, and saving more in times of high income. This is based on you having similar tastes throughout life, though, which is probably not true - you’ll likely find more expensive activities more enjoyable later in life.

Note the advice people are giving here is not wrong; it is just risk-adverse. That’s why the two conditions I listed first are essential. Saving guards against the unexpected and if you aren’t certain your parents could cover you in the case of huge emergency expenditures or in your future self’s ability to cover your current spending level, you should be saving. The rest of this thread’s advice is best for the majority of people, but if you are lucky enough to meet the two conditions, enjoy it."

Works perfectly for handling that inflection point where pessimistic disconnectedness turns into awe-inspiring existentialism.

The quote just misuses the word “greed” to mean “want”. Here’s the [definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/greed): “a selfish and excessive desire for more of something (such as money) than is needed”. You should really rewatch the movie if you think Gordon Gekko should be a source for any sort of moral teaching."
