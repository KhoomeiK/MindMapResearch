Automatic pay scales are an issue that can be dealt through performance but if you can't fire people then they aren't used properly.  There is no career progression for a lot so trying it to performance would be good again. It'd either have to be scored independently of the school or the schools would need to be assessed and the principle or other MGMT held accountable for them. Can't see either getting go ahead as teachers will throw a fit over it.

Distressed loans need to be dealt with and the courts here are pretty lenient if people are engaging. If they are buying the property it wouldn't raise the market price unless they are willing to let the units idle. Rents will go down from regulations and taxes on ownership but voters here would have a fit over that while we've a large homeowning cohort, Irish water is an example of that.
