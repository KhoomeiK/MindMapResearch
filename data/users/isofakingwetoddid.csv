depression,feuj81l,t3_eqkzx8,1579387022.0,"I’m the same way man. My dad is mentally ill and my mom never puts herself first. I have a parent on both extreme ends of the spectrum. 

I don’t talk to my dad anymore and when I go back home I live with my mom currently. Whenever I go home I don’t like being around her, which is really fucked up to say because she does everything for me: pays for tuition, rent, bills, etc. I owe her everything and she expects nothing in return except for me to graduate (which I will be in May). 

However, my mom has become emotionally attached to me (I’m the younger of two kids) and she is emotionally dependent on my sister. It’s a very unhealthy situation, and now that I’m older,  this concept is much more transparent. Since my dad refused to work, my mom has always worked at least two jobs for as long as I can remember. So throughout high school, my mom was at work, my dad was either laying in bed or passed out from mixing alcohol and Vicodin, my sister had her own social life, and I was alone. 

I’ve gotten so used to it. My sister was away at college when my mom left my dad. While my mom was at work, the day we left I spent two hours sneaking essentials down to my car for my mom and myself. After she got off work, she texted my dad and said they were done. 

My mom always tells me that “we were like a unit going through it together”, but I just see it as me just being on my own and figuring out ways to pass the time. My mom thinks that we’re closer than we really are. Also a fucked up thing to say, but that’s reality

Experiencing my mom’s issues first-hand as I get older changes the way I interact with her. Because she’s so delicate and goes out of her way to do things, it’s impossible for her to ever be calm. 


Sorry for the long story, but you are not wrong or a bad person for becoming slowly disconnected from your parents. If anything it shows you’re changing as a person, and on your way to becoming someone you want to be. That’s not a bad thing. That’s something few people figure out early in life."
threebodyproblem,feo2cjc,t1_fel5fmw,1579294155.0,Too bad there was an article released earlier today about tourists coming back from China with a sickness of some sort
threebodyproblem,feo23k4,t1_fel5fmw,1579294125.0,I made my comment out of sarcasm. The fact this is a real thing makes me want to go here for spring break or something lmao

Where do I sign?"
depression,fekoo7o,t1_fekofb6,1579204426.0,"That’s really great to hear! Productivity is one thing, but being productive with things you enjoy is very rejuvenating. Sorry to hear your relationship ended; I hope you find someone :) :hugs:"
depression,fekn201,t3_epe2m7,1579203463.0,"When you’re depressed you’re so mentally drained. It’s like coming home from working a 12 hour shift at work, but said shift never really stops. Your mind races with thoughts and you can’t get it to slow down. Then when it finally does, you’re exhausted. I’ve been there. It takes a while of being in the right place to get back into the mindset. I was fortunate enough to have a month off of school for winter break and that gave me enough time to recharge my batteries 

Not everyone is as fortunate. I wish you the best of luck in finding a place and time to get away and reground with the world and people around you <3"
threebodyproblem,fdsa6ga,t1_fds5o8x,1578697903.0,Thanks for clearing up the countdown. And the billionaire was the guy who was planting trees for the forest who’s dad owned the oil company correct?
depression,fdoml8l,t1_fdmtmh5,1578608215.0,"I’m sorry you feel this way man. I used to think that about myself. I have been fortunate and lucky to have family support. Not everyone gets that. I hope you get better. The first few steps are the hardest. While you may be alone, you have your own company. Try to enjoy being alone. I’m a bit of a misfit myself, and I found life is better for me with the self-support mentality. It takes time to develop this mentality, however it is worth it"
depression,fdlukai,t3_els6qu,1578532836.0,"2019 was a shit year. To anyone who is struggling, scared, cornered, stuck, afraid, overwhelmed, etc. You are not alone, and there will always be people supporting you, whether it be family, friends, or random people on the internet. The battle is tough, but you can and will win<3"
threebodyproblem,fdg2d0y,t1_fdg18u7,1578377449.0,"Right on man I have The Dark Forest right next to me. I’m glad I took physics a year ago because that helped with a lot of the terminology and I work with computers as a side hobby. So, while I don’t read books very often, The Three Body Problem was a book right up my alley that kept me interested and entertained because of the complexity"
threebodyproblem,fdcldxu,t1_fdckjg0,1578277790.0,Okay thanks. That makes a lot more sense now
depression,fdcibrg,t3_ekfp0m,1578275616.0,"I stay up until 3 or 4 in the morning; after getting drunk and smoking a little bit. I stay up until I feel like a zombie and physically can’t stay up anymore, then sleep for around 12 hours. Even on medications life sucks. I still have stress dreams and nightmares that are so vivid I wake up covered in sweat, and sometimes I feel like I yell in my sleep. But fuck it. I’ll sleep my days away and stay up almost all night"
depression,fbz3m3c,t3_ef4960,1577234058.0,"Yeah same. I talked about it with my family and how I don’t care all that much for Christmas. For me I turned 22 last month, and I just don’t care at all about the holidays. Everybody makes such a huge deal out of holidays like Christmas and I couldn’t care less"
depression,fblm0a8,t1_fbiyzuy,1576965012.0,"That’s a point I was making with this, as drinking frequently is something you do in college. Earlier this year, I did use alcohol to cope with depression. Now I’m past that, and I’m doing so much better. My mom noticed my improvements, and she tells me how she can tell I’m doing much better. But she still worries about every little thing and it’s so frustrating because she essentially disregards what I tell her"
