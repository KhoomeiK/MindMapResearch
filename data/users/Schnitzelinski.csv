therewasanattempt,fgsdgsx,t1_fgsat8b,1581081240.0,"But does that mean that we can't readapt Christmas into something that fits more into a modern polyethnic society, although it was originally Christian? It would be a fest of love and compassion, including people from many different cultures, which in itself is a Christian philosophy. The fact that it was adapted from Pagan traditions would suggest that you could. This is extremely important especially today. In its roots, Christianity doesn't want to exclude people only because they don't identify with that name. And even if it is cultural appropriation, I don't think that cultures can coexist for very long without any appropriation. No culture can exist in isolation."

They have very fertile riverbanks but is still underdeveloped. This applies to a lot of countries in South East Asia or South America for example. 

Colonialism has one goal: Exploitation. Colonial powers kept their colonies for the profit, with very little regard for native ethnicities or development. As you say, Africa has been colonized a lot longer, still to this day in new forms. Many South American nations still suffer from neo-colonial influence by the US although many countries there have declared their independence for longer. Colonialism is still a very recent thing.

Guessing from your post, I don't think you know a lot about Africa and how culturally and politically diverse it. So I suggest you read a little about it or watch a documentary. We like to see it as one country, although it really isn't. It contains Egypt for example, a country that used to be one of the first human civilizations ever and also one of the first to use irrigation."
