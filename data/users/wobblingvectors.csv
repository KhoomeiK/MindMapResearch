You know exactly what you are & how to latch onto vulnerable survivors of abuse like a lamprey. Every post you posted to me was meant to denigrate me. I know you so well. The type is reported to be 4% of the human population. I have read reviews of books online about sociopaths. Many people, both psychiatrists, like the psychiatrist who wrote ""Toxic Psychiatry,"" Dr. Breggan (I believe that was his name; gave book away) &  People who were given the ""treatment"" or knew people who had been in ""therapy"" with a quack, have written about the subjects of lousy doctors, mental health ""professionals""; both online articles and in books. You are not correct about anything except the nomenclature of botany/biology, which is no Gargantua to scientists. You don't know from Gulley Jimson. You never heard of Sir Alec Guinness. You don't know Wes Anderson's movies. You never ask questions. You don't know the real, complicated history of ""random."" I certainly do know more than the bargain basement (ever heard of Macy's?) unprofessional doctors I  had the misfortune to run into. You don't, as I said, ask me what happened. You don't remotely care. You aren't a human (not as opposed to animals, as if humans were sacred, instead of apes); you are a robotic troll programmed to undermine anyone who shows sensitivity.

I have met other trolls like you; I don't think they are bots or Russian troublemakers; just mean, hostile ne'er-do-wells. You have not read my posts with comprehension.

I read science every week; I've read it since I was 20. I know about the capitalization of Genus, the minuscule of species. I don't give a damn. I am free to spell, punctuate, write as I please.
