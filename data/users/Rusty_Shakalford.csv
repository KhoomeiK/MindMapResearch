The island targets people in relationships, and never more than one from the same city in a year. Makes it look like they've cheated on their partner, have witnesses say they drowned, and offer money for the partner to keep quiet about it. Partner is usually so distraught that they take the money and want to forget it ever happened. All the people ""not talking about it"" means no one ever connects the dots.

Not this woman though. She's convinced that her partner would never betray her, and that there is something sinister going on at the island. A few red herrings to make it look like a murder mystery (his rival was there at the same time, there are a group of indigenous elves that hate outsiders, etc.) before the full horror is revealed."

“Out of the box” D&D is definitely bad at this.

The biggest problem is that players are *incredibly* hard to kill in D&D unless they are subjected to wave after wave of enemies to drain their resources and force death saves. A wilderness journey is made of many small encounters that pose no immediate threat to any player above level 3 or so.

There’s also the unspoken contract that players will have their character for a long time. Dying of dysentery or a lone bear is very unsatisfying way to go.

**Weapons**

Swinging a weapon at an enemy does not guarantee a hit. When you use a weapon the game goes through three steps:

1. Did the weapon make contact with the enemy’s hitbox?
2. If so, did the enemy dodge?
3. If it did not dodge, how much damage did the weapon do?

The game compares your skill with the weapon against the enemy’s agility (along with a bit of randomness) to decide if you made contact. This can be confusing because there’s no visual indication that your enemy dodged, or that you didn’t simply miss them entirely.
If you hit, the game then checks the weapon’s damage, and your relevant ability (Strength, Endurance, etc.) to decide how much damage you do.
Skill does not affect how much damage you do, merely how likely you are to hit.

**Armor**

Armor works mostly the same as other ES titles. Wearing good armor raises an armor value. The higher the value, the less damage you take. There are three things to keep in mind.

Shields are passive, not active. Unlike Skyrim there is no way to control if your shield is up. Instead you have a “Block” skill. The higher it is, the more likely you will raise your shield when an enemy swings at you.

Beast races cannot wear shoes. This means they cannot wear boots and thus their armor sets will be incomplete. They can still get their armor values pretty high though.

There is only one full set of Daedric armor in the game. Pieces are scattered all over, so good luck finding them.

**Magic**

Spells can fail in Morrowind. Like weapons, the higher your skill, the more likely you are to cast successfully.

More powerful spells require higher skill levels to have a decent chance of working. With the spell creation system it is possible to create spells so powerful that there is a ~0% chance of success, even with maxed out skills. There is a way around this though (discussed later).

**Health/Magicka/Stamina**

Health and Magicka do not regenerate on their own. You need to either sleep, use magic (for health) or drink potions to replenish.

Stamina does regenerate on its own, and affects almost everything you do. Swinging a weapon or casting a spell? In addition to your skill level, having full stamina maximizes the odds of success, while low stamina lowers it.

The problem is that running and jumping drains your stamina. It’s useful to have potions to restore your stamina, but also to keep your eyes open. Take a minute to “catch your breath” before engaging in combat or casting a spell.

**Luck**

In addition to stamina, your Luck stat also affects pretty much every action that has a chance of failure. A high luck stat can sometimes compensate for low skills or stamina.

In fact, if you manage to pump your Luck stat to absurdly high levels all kind of weird things happen. Enemies can’t hit you and every weapon you swing makes a critical. Those “impossible” spells I mentioned earlier? As long as you have enough magicka and high enough luck, you can cast burst spells that will kill everyone in a town at once.

**Player/Character Separation**

As you can tell by now there’s a lot of chances for failure in Morrowind. The big reason is that, although 3D, it embraces an old-school RPG paradigm where there is a strict separation of what the character can do and what the player can do.

In Skyrim I can make a master archer character. In my next playthrough I make a mage. If I get bored while playing as a mage I can pick up a bow and hit enemies as easily as the master archer could (although my damage might be lower). The character is under my complete control, so skills from one transfer to the next.

In Morrowind my mage character would miss every shot they took. The character is not just an empty vessel; they have things they are good and bad at and my skill as a player won’t change that.

I’m not saying one or the other is better, but it’s a mental shift you have to make to play Morrowind.

There’s a bunch of other stuff, but this should cover the big points."

Dan Carlin had an interesting observation that, when studying WWI it’s hard not to find the Soviets a bit refreshing when they show up.

It’s a bit controversial in the lore community. A lot of people feel in leans in too hard on the “Vivec realizes they are a character in a video game” rather than accepting his abilities in the context of the narrative.

Showerthoughts,fczg46e,t3_ejmtu1,1578100496.0,"Morrowind played with this idea a bit.

Vivec, one of the central characters, implies in his eponymous book series that he is well aware of the protagonist’s ability to simply come back to “the waking world” whenever they die.

The trippy part is, Vivec implies that *he also* has this power. The books even dare the hero to kill him, and the secret path to the ending can only be unlocked by doing so. And yet, in Oblivion, Vivec is rumoured to be alive.

It’s not concrete of course, but it’s weird to think of an NPC that can save scum as much as the hero can."

That may not be true. At least according to Wikipedia:

> It is a common misconception that the heliocentric view was held as sacrilegious by the contemporaries of Aristarchus.[6] Lucio Russo traces this to Gilles Ménage's printing of a passage from Plutarch's On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon, in which Aristarchus jokes with Cleanthes, who is head of the Stoics, a sun worshipper, and opposed to heliocentrism.[6] In the manuscript of Plutarch's text, Aristarchus says Cleanthes should be charged with impiety.[6] Ménage's version, published shortly after the trials of Galileo and Giordano Bruno, transposes an accusative and nominative so that it is Aristarchus who is purported to be impious.[6] The resulting misconception of an isolated and persecuted Aristarchus is still transmitted today.[6][7]"

It’s a game covering the rise of Morgiah and Helseth. Throughout it you switch between the two narratives: Morgiah in Summerset and Helseth in Morrowind. It’s a Telltale-style game where your choice about who to trust and how to act in court have ramifications for the success of your rule.

The sequel follows Morgiah’s children during their evacuation during the rise of the Thalmor and their escape to the mainland.

My other pitch is for a game that adapts and then completes King Edward, but that ain’t gonna happen in a million years."

Jeremy Crawford [tweeted](https://mobile.twitter.com/JeremyECrawford/status/636288928757104640) that you would only take damage on a jump of the distance you fall is in excess of your jump.

I agree with this for two reasons:

1. It makes zero sense that any level 1 Wizard would take the Jump spell if it was so trivial for them to kill themselves with it.

2. It’s a fools game to bring physics into DnD, but the energy needed to jump into the air is equal to the energy imparted upon landing. If the force didn’t hurt them when they jumped, why would it hurt them when they landed?"

Even that last point isn’t really unique to Christianity. I mean, do people really think the first caveman who settled in Denmark immediately turned to his fellow Palaeolithics and said “Hey, I just had this great idea for religion with Odin, Thor, and a bunch of other gods!”

Although I think that leans more to an appeal to our post-WWII perceptions of Germany (and yes, I’m aware I’m flip-flopping between Doylist and Watsonian logic here).

I wasn’t planning to focus on that one line, just use it as evidence of the theme of the movies’ third act. That same scene has the American villain try to appeal to Milo’s colonial impulses (“If you gave away everything in a museum, you’d have an empty building”) only to have him reject it. You can call this wish-washy since up until now Milo has had no problem working for a museum system benefiting from and promoting colonialism, and only has qualms when he has to face the people being hurt by it (and I’d agree with you), but the movie still pushes the idea that it is wrong to steal the cultural heritage of people just because you have the technology to do so, a theme I place firmly in anti-colonialism."

Milo even says that all they expected to find was ruins and pottery, not a living people. Granted that still doesn’t excuse the 19th century style “treasure hunters in all but name” archeology.

The antagonists are also all (assumes) Americans, so I have to disagree with the theme of it only being bad if an “other” owns them. The film sends a clear message that anyone other than the Atlanteans themselves owning the crystal is wrong.

It feels weird to defend this movie, since largely I agree with you that it presents a very skewered view of how Western Powers interacted with indigenous people. My issue is just that I don’t think Avatar does a better job with its “man, if I’d been there this how I would have handled it” colonial fantasy."

No he isn’t. That’s the whole reason they want to steal the crystal; so they can sell it to the highest bidder as a weapon. Milo even name drops the German Kaiser as a potential buyer."
