This is in the United States and as citizens it's within our rights to peacefully protest whatever the fuck we want. The cops trying to get protesters to leave is a violation of our constitutional rights.

Edit: can't LEGALLY do shit** since so many people are hung up on semantics"
trashy,ff4gcmm,t1_ff4fw1w,1579562944.0,Do you have any research to back up your claims? That's a lot of unbased assumptions you're making.

trashy,ff4e9hy,t1_ff4drhs,1579561541.0,"I'm aware of that, I'm not vegan but I don't wear fur. Not all anti fur people are vegans but all vegans are anti fur and I think the disdain for anti-fur on reddit has a lot to do with the general disdain for vegans."
trashy,ff4e1h3,t1_ff4dsx3,1579561392.0,"Oh no I made a typo, sue me. And I never said that planned parenthood protestors are wrong. I said the context is different, which it is, but that it's still their right as long as they aren't touching or hurting anyone. Same thing applies to the fur protesters. Why are you so hard-pressed to make me sound like a hypocrite when I've clearly stated that I think both protesting groups are well within their rights?"
trashy,ff4dqxb,t1_ff4d6tz,1579561199.0,"My SO never ever brings it up unless someone offers him meat and people are still rude to him about it on a regular basis. On my side of the family, on his side, his co-workers, etc. He's a very private and quiet man, not in your face about anything. Sometimes you have to mention your dietary restrictions. It's not a major part of his personality at all. But for some people 'meat eating' is and they will be in your face about it."
trashy,ff4dfme,t1_ff4d52v,1579560992.0,"No, it's different because generally there is a culture of privacy surrounding someone's medical decisions. It's rude to ask about someone's doctor's visits and there are laws surrounding medical privacy, it's called HIPPA. People buying coats from a shop on the main street of a popular city is just not the same situation."

trashy,ff4d1bg,t1_ff4clm5,1579560730.0,Yeah you didn't see it so you can't assume they were doing something wrong. If you think people don't just turn into ravenous assholes like this you've never worked in customer service. I've had people throw things at me for far less.
trashy,ff4cur2,t1_ff4ciqw,1579560611.0,"If they aren't calling them names or touching them, it's their right. It is a little bit of a different situation though, you must admit. I used to go to planned parenthood to get birth control and it's kind of embarrassing as a teen girl to have alllll these people watching you enter a clinic for reproductive health just because of the shame culture around it."
trashy,ff4ceh8,t1_ff4btce,1579560337.0,"There's no 'official movement' but there are definitely people who take it as a personal attack when others don't eat meat. It seems like a lot of people take it as a political statement. When you say 'I'm a vegan' you may as well be saying something outright political like 'I support abortion' or something. There's a big undercurrent of men who make it a part of their personalities to love eating meat and are going to mock the hell out of other men who don't, insulting their masculinity and such. I've seen this firsthand."
trashy,ff4blgz,t1_ff4ati3,1579559796.0,"I mean I've witnessed lots of people harrass my SO for not eating meat in person, so it's not just on the internet. Saying you don't eat meat is worse than saying you don't drink. Family members are constantly 'forgetting' and trying to take him to steakhouses for his birthday or putting bacon in the salad and trying to tell him it's meatless lol. Not to mention the jokes about how he's not 'manly' because he doesn't eat meat or people trying to 'tempt' him into eating the meat they've made. I've only ever met one annoying vegan in real life."
trashy,ff4ajn6,t1_ff4a752,1579559133.0,It's to raise awareness and let our government and institutions know what citizens want and don't want my dude. If you don't like protests you're free to live somewhere where they aren't allowed. You'll also have to deal with a totalitarian government but maybe it'll be worth it for ya. I've been to about 10 protests and I've never seen anything other than sign holding and some chants. Acting like throwing paint and blocking highways is the norm is disingenuous
trashy,ff49k1c,t1_ff40ngu,1579558509.0,"I find it interesting that as a collective, people on Reddit seem really invested in climate change and being green until it comes to vegans. God forbid people not want to contribute to animal industries that are essentially the leading factor in climate change. I'm dating a vegetarian and people take it so personally too. He doesn't like to mention it to the point where instead of telling people he's vegetarian he just won't eat when there's nothing for him. Because people are assholes about it for no reason at all."
trashy,ff49bk5,t1_ff481ov,1579558360.0,I've been to plenty of protests and yeah that's exactly what happens. You stand there with a sign. Maybe you march around the block. What do you have against protests? It's one of the biggest forms of free speech citizens can utilize in the US. Becoming involved with protests and issues you care about is a part of being involved with your government. It's a major thing that people in other countries have died doing because their governments won't let them. It's important.
trashy,ff48yzp,t1_ff47m2i,1579558144.0,It's really not. If the people with signs aren't hurting or touching anyone it's a peaceful protest and it's their right to exercise. I've joined plenty of protests and no one has ever tried to tell me I was attacking and harassing people by holding a sign and standing/walking. That's fucking ridiculous.
trashy,ff48rgd,t1_ff42xj9,1579558011.0,"You just watched one.. two people standing outside holding signs is pretty peaceful. Reddit has a huge hate hard-on for vegans and the like for whatever reason, but it's our right as citizens in the US to peacefully protest and that is exactly what these people are doing. You really have no reason to believe otherwise."

relationship_advice,ff3l5y4,t1_ff342pm,1579543385.0,Yeah putting down another woman in an effort to make her look bad to your shitty boyfriend is NOT the way. It's kind of sad. She didn't ask for this and lasting friendships are more important than fleeting relationships anyways. It's been four months and the boyfriend is already behaving terribly. Keep your friend and cut out the boyfriend OP!
MensLib,ff3hfpg,t1_ff3cly5,1579541105.0,"I felt like that too. It's pretty straight forward. Homophobic men generally have an issue with men being feminine. They associate gayness with feminine men which they think is 'wrong' and as an extension, that femininity is just less than in general. Homophobes are sexists almost always. Women who are homophobes are no different. They have a problem with men or women going outside their gender norm boundaries and usually have sexist ideas of how men and women should be."
BeautyGuruChatter,ff226xp,t1_ff215ow,1579491793.0,Sources? I'm in school studying environmental sciences and every class I've had in the subject has talked about overpopulation being an issue in depth. I'm inclined to agree with the numerous professors that have doctorates in environmental studies that have taught me that overpopulation IS an issue. But if you have credible research I am interested.

alexandrasavior,feukdcj,t1_fetrgvo,1579387325.0,I don't know much about her personal life but that could very much be a persona. Lana Del Rey sings about being a gold digging depressed diva who would die without a man most of the time but is actually a very happy & successful person irl.
college,fen9h7q,t1_fen8zr1,1579279879.0,"So if my handicapped cousin molests me it's not sexual assault? Are you kidding? No matter who it's coming from, whether they can be held fully responsible or not, it's still sexual harrassment. It's still going to be humiliating for the professor.

Then I start with a really small pump of foundation and a damp beauty blender and I blend it into my skin and spread it as far as possible and go in thin buildable layers until I get the coverage I want! Then I use a tiny bit of concealer for any spots. I avoid putting too much foundation on the clearer parts of my skin like my cheeks as well so you can see my actual skin come through a bit"

TrollXChromosomes,febhq40,t3_eo9tfo,1578958900.0,"This site is so depressingly misogynistic. The male centricity is glaring.

I've been with my SO for 3 years and I still shut down when he makes advances. I can only feel relaxed if I'm completely in control of the situation. If I feel like he's coming on too strong I go into defense mode.

Cooking,fcuvy6q,t3_ej0y2g,1577989639.0,"Sweet potato quesadillas are something I eat multiple times a week. I chop up sweet potatoes, throw them in a pot with veggie broth then season with paprika, chili powder, garlic, salt, and cumin. Let it simmer until all the liquid is soaked up. Then put it on a good tortilla with cheese and black beans, cook til crispy. It's such little work and they are so delicious I crave them constantly."

He's having a blast. He tells people ""I play with rocks and draw pictures all day"". He's never wanted to work in a lab so he got a job in the field and thinks it's great. Not all science careers end in lab work."

We've been together 3 and a half years now, he is graduated, has a real job, and I'm still going to school. I wouldn't have it any other way but neither of us have ever liked casual dating. We did the open relationship thing for awhile but both hated it. I don't think I've missed out at all but that's just me."

They aren't expensive at all and are absolutely amazing for dry skin, particularly their cream. For an exfoliate never use physical exfoliants!
