RocketLeagueExchange,fe774z3,t3_enx7qr,1578910914.0,This gave me chills. I was reading this and was happy to see that connection build. I had thoughts in my head of me and my brothers. Then reading what happened to your bother really just hit deep. Life is just so rough man. I can’t imagine what going through that has been for you. I’m very sorry for your loss.

RocketLeagueExchange,fc0txus,t1_fc06k1p,1577299607.0,">There will be another game, another time period in your life when this shit doesn’t mean anything to you. You will have kids, you will travel, you will make real memories with real people and realize that silly time when you were younger making a few bucks on virtual items is completely irrelevant. Right now it might give you a high or a joy, but just think of when you first see your future wife or your favorite sports team win a championship. Those are things you should yearn for. Maybe it’s because I’m old or because I don’t trade anymore, but life is full of great things outside of this toxic heap of a market my friend.
>>Merry Christmas and happy holidays.

That was amazing. I found that really inspiring and thought provoking. I don’t care for all the trading hype.. it was never important to me but I can relate what you said to life itself and that was a lesson well learned.. I need to stop taking things so seriously and lighten up.. I want to go into 2020 with more positivity and to eliminate negativity to the fullest wherever possible. Thank you"
