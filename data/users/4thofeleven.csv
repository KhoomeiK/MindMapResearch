startrek,femlwgl,t3_epymmr,1579261900.0," Ignoring the moral issues of Section 31's behavior, from a purely pragmatic point of view, their existence threatens the credibility of the Federation. Because the Federation government has no control over their actions, and cannot ever hold them to account, all other governments must assume that the Federation is incapable of holding to any agreements with its neighbours. 

  
  Consider, for example, the Dominion. The plot to destroy the Great Link took place without any support from the Federation government or Starfleet. The Dominion, post-war, then, must know that even if the Federation Council and Starfleet are completely honest in their desire for a lasting peace,  they have no ability to stop Section 31 from repeating its plans, and therefore must consider the Federation a *de facto* threat, regardless of what diplomatic agreements exist.

  
  In effect, Section 31 is a terrorist organisation that the Federation is unwittingly giving safe haven to. And states that are unwilling or unable to prevent such organisations from taking root within their borders are generally referred to, respectively, as rogue states or failed states. And, whatever reason applies, the neighbours of such a state will inevitable take matters into their own hands to restore control."

Needless to say, the old priesthood was not amused by any of this, and Tutankhamun/aten, who came to the throne at a very young age and was always sickly, was never in any position to try and cement his father's changes, and so Akhenaten and the cult of Aten were largely suppressed and erased from official histories."
saltierthancrait,fdmw2yn,t3_em7wnu,1578568504.0,"I think in theory, it's a good idea to give new characters a chance to establish themselves and win over the audience on their own. For example, when Star Trek: The Next Generation premiered, they intentionally didn't bring back any classic characters outside of a small cameo in the pilot until the show had run for a few seasons. When the X-Men were relaunched in the mid-70s with a new roster, most of the original team were sidelined for a while for the same reason. It doesn't matter how good your new characters are if the audience is still thinking of them purely as 'the new characters', you want to establish them as the main cast in their own right.

Now, the problem with TFA is that it sabotages itself by still making the whole story about Luke. It doesn't matter that he's not on screen if everyone's looking for him, talking about him, and relying on him to save the day. It basically sets up the new characters as being 'not quite up to the task'. And then, of course, TLJ compounds the problem by essentially making Luke the main character, and giving him more of an arc than any of the new cast get. It's really only in RoS that the new characters finally get the chance to step out of their predecessor's shadow, and by then, the damage had already been done."
