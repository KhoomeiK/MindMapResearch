Well I wish I was super clever but it’s more a pun on small lord Voldemort before he’s put in the caldron and gets his body back. There was a picture going around a while back of “this is what an aborted baby looks like“ and it was actually just small Lord Voldemort so in my head I have always said “Lord Smalldemort.” Anyway, not very interesting or very clever but I really don’t like making user names lol"

Like I get every aspect of“it is medical and it’s just a butt hole” and everything. But I am unreasonably upset about the prospect of doing it one day. Is it true that because you have to see everything, you have to inflate the bowels with air, which then sounds like a fart festival in the recovery afterwards? When you say that you’re out of the line of fire, I assume that means if someone doesn’t properly “cleanse their colon” that means that poo could fly out?"

Weird,fec8amy,t1_fea1yjo,1578968393.0,"Dude you just sent me down a two hour wormhole. Let me just tell you what I learned.

She is severely mentally ill. I mean severely. So, she dated a Sony executive in 2013, and he dumped her. He said he didn’t want anything serious with her, chances are he’s married. These are all words from her own mouth that have just come up because really she believes that she is God and Martin is the devil, that’s her ex, and she’s going to also face 7 years of trials and tribulations as she works her way to become true Jesus. Her videos, about the illuminati existing and all of the songs being made for her and how her name actually can be translated into the word God like so many ways... they are fucking cuckoo for cocoa puffs. She even has a video where she admits that she’s been told by a health specialist she might be suffering from severe mental illness and she said she didn’t agree with them so she tried someone else. So I’m under the impression she got dumped and went nuts because she was already probably mentally ill and then she went and literally became delusional, seeing herself as the second coming of Jesus and as God now. Her tribulations will be over when Martin returns to her she said. So, anyway that’s what I learned. What a juicy story. How much money you wanna bet he has a restraining order on her?"
Weird,febsmw9,t1_feaeqm4,1578962233.0,"I just did like 20 minutes of stalking on her YouTube and she’s definitely mentally ill and horrible at spelling. She made this video about how when a psychiatrist or whatever doesn’t agree with you/you don’t agree with what they’re saying about your behavior, you can just leave and find someone else LOL but by her own admission, she was displaying concerning behaviors. So… When you take the 38 minute video of her explaining how, through her name, she is God, and then mix it with her basically no mental health stance on mental health, you get a recipe for someone making a video every single day that absolutely no one will watch but people on Reddit are going to laugh at. It’s actually very sad, but she seems happy I guess."

askwomenadvice,febjqu4,t3_eny2ux,1578959556.0,"This happened to me when I was 20 and now that I realize the situation you are describing is exactly what I was going through I guess I should give you the advice I had. I told him he was really inappropriate if he continues in his way of contacting me and it was not invited. And to just never do it again. Believe it or not he kept trying and still has and I’m 32 now. But yeah I don’t be nice, I know you may not have figured out that sometimes you just have to be a mean bitch sometimes, but when people are entitled to continue bothering you, you’re definitely entitled to be a bit firm with them in response. Oh, then block him after telling him he’s inappropriate and to never speak to you again."

Teachers,feao5d0,t1_fe63eaz,1578950764.0,"It speaks to how teachers are expected to have a mindset that doesn’t serve themselves, but always and I mean ALWAYS serves others Before ourselves, until we burn out even. Like you signed up for more than just a career. You signed up for putting yourself second for the rest of your life. Or at least that’s the expectation, right? You can’t be excited about a snow day, because that means kids missed out. Even though you had no control over said snow day, you shouldn’t celebrate it. 

Now I get the part about social media. You probably shouldn’t rub it in the face of the school district. But among friends? On responsibly private social media? You are allowed to feel. We are all allowed to feel. We work toward something greater than most people ever would try or dare go into. That should be enough, we shouldn’t also be bound by feelings of selflessness on snow days like we should be going in to volunteer at a soup kitchen instead. 

I’ve taken such an interest in the double standards that exist for teachers. Once someone told me they were surprised I was a teacher because I cursed. I didn’t realize teachers were supposed to be G-rated humans who sounded more like Ned Flanders lol."

Concussion,fdvg45j,t1_fdvfoqc,1578747105.0,"So random, I just started seeing a psychiatrist who I really love because he is very much understanding oriented., And so he had me give a cheek swab for Genomind. It’s a nice look at your genetic factors and how they might affect the medication that takes you. For example, I have always felt that opiates don’t sit right with me. You know like they just don’t seem to work the same as they’re supposed to and it turns out I do have a Set of alleles that encode for resistance to opiates. I didn’t shed much light on other medications but it tested for different genes and how they interact with antidepressants as well. I wonder if I could shed some light for you."

Concussion,fdvfjjr,t3_en519d,1578746894.0,"Someone else said that you seem very depressed and I want to let you know that I’ve been about 5 1/2 months post concussion and my memory issues come and go but when they come, I go from being like really really intelligent and being really capable in my career to forgetting everything and pretending I didn’t because if I tell everyone that I forgot their names right away or if I tell them I can’t remember what they just told me, it looks bad. But it comes and goes, and then basically if I’m depressed, it’s 1 million times worse. There very well could still be treatment options for you, but I know how frustrating it is when people don’t believe you. But I would believe that you’re depressed potentially and you would not believe how helpful it is to take care of one big issue so you can remember things again. It’s very common to get emotional issues after your concussion not just because it affects your life, but because it can affect your brain chemistry of course. I know this is a lot of peoples go to answer, but a therapist can be extremely helpful if you let them in. I’m sorry I can’t help you more."

TwoXChromosomes,fdritnw,t1_fdqnj4i,1578685148.0,"Well it’s a really nice alternative to the “normal” ones! If you find discomfort with it, ask your practitioner/Dr./whatever to try the pediatric size and you might be surprised that it changes the experience to be much less uncomfortable. As I recall it took her a little bit more time to find my cervix but it was still plenty of space for her to get the Q-tip in LOL. Gross but true. It didn’t hurt and it felt less violating!"

TwoXChromosomes,fdolk2o,t1_fdmwdlr,1578607601.0,I can’t believe I didn’t know there was a pediatric one until recently as well. Maybe they should present some size opportunities before they go shoving the adult sized one in there. Now I always ask for the pediatric one.

That might be one of the biggest secrets honestly, exfoliation. Then, lots and lots of moisturizer. I have finally settled on kiehls ultra facial cream. And then I’m also a big fan of micellar water in the afternoon/evening after getting all sweaty during the day and to remove make up if I wear it that day. Recently I went on Mercari and purchased something that came over the summer, 111 skins vitamin C skin brightening booster. I swear that stuff makes you glow.
