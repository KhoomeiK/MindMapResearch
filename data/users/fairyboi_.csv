HIMYM,ff6f4mv,t1_ff68v6c,1579625836.0,"Same. That one girl in high school who thinks you're best friends and does everything you do and follows you around all the time, even though you've expressed minimal interest in being casual friends with her. She gets her hair cut like yours and dresses the same way as you, basically wants to *be* you. And it would be sad if she wasn't so absolutely obnoxious and annoying and constantly trying to get your undivided attention. Every time you go to the mall, she's there, waiting for you. She tells you that she talks about you to her family all the time even though you've probably had 3 full conversations with her. Her mother shows up to a function and says she's ""heard so much about you!"" but *you've* never talked about *her* because she isn't really that significant to you. From an outside perspective you look like an asshole for not wanting to be friends with someone who's *so nice to you.* But you can't explain to them how her showing up at class/work with a plate of cookies that look like the two of you holding hands with ""BFF"" written across them is boundary-crossing and creepy. If it was a guy it'd be stalking, but because it's a nice girl nobody sees the problem. You simply can't have a healthy relationship with someone who has that severe an attachment disorder -- which makes Robin's relationship with Barney and the involvement of Patrice so ironic; she's trading one attachment disorder for another.

I had no idea who Jeffrey Epstein was until recently, but now literally all I know about him is that he was a human trafficker or whatever. Bill Cosby, however, had my support from watching his TV show, which made it harder for me to come to terms with him being a rapist--but also he had the support of millions of people who wouldn't have given him positive publicity had they known the truth. Imagine if, in the 90's, the only thing you knew about him was hearing people say ""Bill Cosby is a rapist."" I doubt you'd be very interested in the Cosby Show after that.
