EscapefromTarkov,fdn93vv,t3_emabki,1578580561.0,"Making money is a very easy task in concept.  Some do lootruns, where their goal of the raid is to stuff as much loot up their butt as possible and extract.  Some just passively profit by playing and doing their quests.  If your goal is to boost your money quickly,  I suggest you start using your scav on reserve.  Once you get familiar with it, bring your PMC on for some loot runs.  Look up Reserve lootruns on youtube to get familiar with where loot spawns and what is worth.  Bosses are a great boost in money/gear however you can't rely on them to always be there.  All of the bosses have around a 35%-40% chance of spawning.  Progression is as simple as what you want.  Most people try to hit level 40 as their end goal, as after 40 you have all your traders at level 4.  Some people's goal is to complete every quest to recieve the Kappa container, a secure container that is 4x3.  Some people's goal is just to be able to mod weapons for fun and run them when they want.  As for cheaters, not really.
