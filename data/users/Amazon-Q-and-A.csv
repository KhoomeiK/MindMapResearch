pics,fdv4ko1,t1_fduxun8,1578743173.0,"People are generally really appreciative of firefighters when there are fires. I have not been overseas but in the U.S. as a Wildland Firefighter, it is really nice when people show support. I've personally had civilians come up to our crews and just express their gratitude. Even had a farmer in Georgia give a couple sacks of Onions to the crew as the only way he could think of to thank us.

It makes it even more worth it, when people go out of their way to thank fire crews and extra motivation for the difficult and often dangerous work that firefighters do."
