But in the long run, what prescription that guy was taking or being prescribed is irrelevant. He clearly didn't receive the best service possible and paid a premium for the ""luxury."""

witcher,fcuii9t,t1_fcue5ex,1577981759.0,"How do you know that? Any information I have found suggests that Netflix had 70-80 million for the show. Why would it cost 10 million per episode when the early episodes of GOT cost 6 mil each? Even the battle of blackwater only hit 8 million.

Obviously I'm not comparing the two in terms of story or whatnot but using quality, especially those early seasons, seems fair.

politics,fcofuj2,t1_fcnscqy,1577831222.0,"The problem is that the change in enforcement is entirely legal due to the poor legislation in place. For instance, the CWA is a fairly poorly written piece of legislation that fails to properly define jurisdiction of the FED when it comes to water resources. What Obama did in 2015 was actually, theoretically, illegal because he overstepped the bounds of what the CWA vaguely stipulated as jurisdictional.

Don't like how things are regulated? Until the Judiciary says otherwise, we have congress to blame for building in such large cracks that Administration's can tailer enforcement to partisan sides.

Edit: it's funny when you post stuff like this that's entirely true but people just don't like it, so they downvote."
