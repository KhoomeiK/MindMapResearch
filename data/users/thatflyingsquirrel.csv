PUBGConsole,ffb1sej,t1_ffaopxx,1579749647.0,But they still sacrifice graphics so they can have the frames and with the lower graphics it’s easier to see people.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ff4froh,t3_erfjrf,1579562550.0,"A lot of people go through this and continue to go through it through their entire lives, which leads to significant portions of their lives missing from photographic evidence.

* Examples
   * Had a baby, I didn't want a lot of photos taken of me because I felt fat.
   * I went on vacation, ate a lot the first day, and felt bloated the entire time.  I didn't want to look like a cow in any of my photos.
   * I overate on Thanksgiving.  Then I continued to eat until after New Years'.
* Then I'll look back at photos of myself years ago even when there are significant gaps because I think I didn't look great, and I have realized I looked confident and young.  I was in better shape than I am now but not as good as shape as college.
* It has to be a decision to give up on the worry and accept yourself for who you are.  If for no other reason, then you should be able to have photographic evidence of your life without having to look at what you consider ""amazing.""
* And for a **practical tip.**  Most people's faces are asymmetric to some degree.  What we generally perceive as ourselves is the mirror reflection of ourselves, as this is what we see most of the time while in the bathroom. BUT when we take a photo of ourselves, it's not a mirror image. It's our actual image.  
   * To overcome this disdain for your image, start looking at yourself in the selfie camera a lot.  Do it in different lights and at different times of the day and say to yourself, **""I am beautiful!""**  Mean it if even for a brief moment and do that for at least a month 2-3 times a day, and you will feel better about how you look."

SkincareAddiction,fewn2xr,t1_fewh0k0,1579415323.0,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotenosis

Says it turns yellow orangish. My own child ate so many sweet potatoes she was tinted orange. It may not look like a tan but it does give color to your skin."
SkincareAddiction,fewgue7,t1_fevmb17,1579410359.0,But if you eat a ton of carrots or sweet potatoes you turn orangish. Are you saying the vitamin supplement is a variant of what’s found in these vegetables?
SkincareAddiction,fevj56o,t3_eqkxd7,1579398036.0,What happens then if someone takes a supplement that continues a large amount of B-carotene?  I assume you'd get the same orange color to your skin.

popping,fepjqal,t1_felihij,1579322279.0,"Assuming facts and not evidence? That statement doesn’t even mean anything. 

You don’t have to survey all women to know vagina is used by most men and women as the entire female genitalia."
ShittyLifeProTips,fepjjpr,t1_fem6f3j,1579322141.0,Or the acidity might soft your skin. Who’s to say?
tiktoknsfw,fem1ane,t1_fekrnx0,1579236527.0,I bet her bedsheets smell like cigs and cat piss.
ShittyLifeProTips,feldfpb,t1_fektt2a,1579219576.0,It’s water based but contains mucins and combined with the plasma and protein rich fluid would be more osmotic and hold fluid better than salvia would.
todayilearned,felcjsk,t1_feilhlk,1579218984.0,Apparently. As it’s often offered and presented like something that the family can do.
popping,felcezw,t1_feki0ja,1579218895.0,"Technically, you’re wrong because it’s a colloquialism it’s accurate.

The term is still used anatomically also. 

But no one would ever say, “Oh, touch my vulva, oh, now my clitoral hood, okay now stroke the proximal introitus by applying pressure.”  

Nah, girls say, “It’s okay, you can touch my vagina.”"
popping,fejs2ml,t1_fejfvog,1579184455.0,It’s a colloquial term used for the entire genitalia.
todayilearned,feiktb2,t1_feh10wt,1579140856.0,No they don’t. It’s common to offer direct donations for loved ones in the states.
todayilearned,fegrvad,t1_fegp4he,1579101086.0,Just remember if your ma ever needs an organ transplant that if you act as a directed donor for blood to her she can create antibodies to you cells and ruin your chances of giving her a transplant if she would need one.
gaming,fe9t0cx,t1_fe9fm57,1578941227.0,The problem with modern relationships is people look to their spouse as their existential reason for living. Fuck that. They aren’t your god and you don’t need to treat them like that. They can’t make you feel better all the time or serve you or never piss you off.
gaming,fe9sly9,t1_fe9m18p,1578941109.0,"Similar situation here. I work in spurts, a week on and a week off, and that week off means she isn’t cleaning up after her self at all. No cups, no clothes, no picking up after the kids, so then I spend all my time off cleaning up after her. Then when I’m working she’s gotten out of the habit of cleaning up so shit will literally pile up cause I’m working 100 hours in a week and then she gets pissed at my regularly for not “helping”. 

Also, she has no hobby except obsessive checking Facebook. It’s great."
ShittyLifeProTips,fdkbsmg,t3_elpd20,1578500546.0,I let her fall asleep while I was rubbing her back and slipped one of those ring measures on her ringer while I was rubbing her hand and got a perfect measurement.
SkincareAddiction,fcwipky,t3_ej3vd7,1578026686.0,It’s an inconsistent supply. If you’ve got time or you’re going to be there anyway it’s great. Otherwise you can’t rely on it.
OopsDidntMeanTo,fcw2mej,t1_fcuujlh,1578015709.0,"In all fairness, it could be that he has too many."
popping,fbb5to7,t3_ecfoha,1576693927.0,"If you squeeze a deep pimple like this is causes the cyst to internally rupture sometimes and makes it substantially larger. 

Warm compress is your best bet. I’d put either mupiricin or triple antibiotic on it several time a day."
