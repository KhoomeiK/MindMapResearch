penguins,ffa63ph,t1_ff9e98d,1579728611.0,"When he started banging in the goals at the start of the month, a few guys in my fantasy league started looking for him.  Unfortunately for them I had picked him up in November on a hunch.  Getting some interesting trade offers  now."

aww,ff2kgkt,t1_ff2hyhe,1579510268.0,That's too obscure for most people to get. Good work though.

penguins,fezqhns,t1_fezq3ir,1579460369.0,He should have got an extra for interference because he was just holding Letang by the leg while he was trying to skate away.

MMA,few6kqy,t3_eqnt4q,1579406019.0,"Well, that was surprising. Kelleher dominated him on the ground there."
sports,fembmzq,t1_fem8pbe,1579247443.0,"Because a lot of managers are ex-players and so far there haven't been any female players, so it diminishes their chances."
Barca,fegtni4,t3_ep1veb,1579102274.0,"With Barça being owned by the fans as such, you are not only answerable to the club, you are also answerable to a whole city.  That has to be stressful."

Barca,fe3o42d,t1_fe2oc2x,1578851229.0,One of my good mates here calls me un culer  Australià.  I take it as an honour.
avfc,fe3fkop,t1_fe3evq7,1578848800.0,He said a better team.  United are as bad as us at the moment.
avfc,fe3dd37,t3_enp0t2,1578848288.0,"Currently showing all our past, present and future  goalkeepers but none of those goals could have been stopped by any of them.  And weren't the goalkeeper's fault."
Aleague,fdw4lj6,t3_en5wtf,1578754982.0,"Piscopo is a shoot first, find out where the goals are later kinda player."
Aleague,fdw2sas,t3_en5wtf,1578754464.0,"No VAR, but they spend five minutes looking for an offside on other goals?  WTF?"
Aleague,fdw2aa4,t3_en5wtf,1578754262.0,D'Agostino the hero!  See what happens when you have more than three passes in a row before coughing it up...
Aleague,fdvzz7c,t1_fdvz2xx,1578753579.0,"As my Grampa would say, most of these guys have a left foot that's only useful for standing on....if that."
Aleague,fdvy48z,t3_en5wtf,1578753086.0,"People talk about Arnold's tactics, or lack thereof, but a lot of our problems stem from basic skill errors.  My dog can pass the ball more accurately than some of these guys and he doesn't like giving the ball to anyone."
Aleague,fdvswzz,t3_en5wtf,1578751167.0,Finally a decent fucking through ball.  Nice finish too.  Come on now!

AnimalsBeingBros,fdrzfq0,t1_fdrtyw1,1578691999.0,"This sounds so much like my Nana's Rottie, who was also named Lady (the dog, not my Nana).  She was the biggest sook going around but when we were out walking, she would be all happy sniffing around and not caring about anything, until she would see a man walking the opposite way towards us.

She would pull right back to my Nana's leg and watch the person the whole time as they walked past.  And then when she was satisfied there was no danger, she would be back to normal.  She loved my Nana and would protect her with her life.  Best dog ever."

Barca,fdg7i9s,t1_fdg6xcw,1578383240.0,"Without doubt.  Messi said in an interview once that whenever the team was in trouble or doing badly, he wanted Iniesta closer to him purely because he knew he could trust him to understand what he was trying to do and would react accordingly."
sports,fdg5jrp,t3_el5048,1578380881.0,That's some And1 shit right there.
Barca,fdg54pe,t3_el79j5,1578380397.0,The greatest midfield supplying the greatest forward in the history of the game.  We will not see the likes of that team again for a long time.
natureismetal,fd8bfnl,t1_fd77fb7,1578216344.0,Maybe she was checking to see at what age they can start flying. And it turned out that this was too young.

soccer,fcv7tnv,t3_ej33yc,1577996444.0,That was a sexy little lay off by Mane there.  My word he's good.
soccer,fcv70ai,t3_ej33yc,1577995954.0,"I think I might check what Salah is paying for a hattie.  He looks like he will score five tonight.

Edit: lol 5/1.  Obviously they are watching the same thing I am."
soccer,fcv6gt5,t3_ej33yc,1577995635.0,Someone needs to give the kid a hug and tell him to forget it and get his head back in the game.
AnimalsBeingBros,fctyoqo,t1_fcttoal,1577966087.0,I was expecting a shih tzu.
soccer,fcrqo45,t1_fcrqf8e,1577905324.0,Was thinking the same thing.  Did a player try and grab a ball off him or something?
soccer,fcrq7k9,t1_fcrpjhm,1577905152.0,He scored three goals or something.  Made him a great defender apparently.
soccer,fcrpm4f,t1_fcrp8g1,1577904924.0,Apparently someone watched the wrong YouTube video and signed him based on it.  Only explanation.
soccer,fcrp1s2,t3_eil2ne,1577904704.0,Mina is being a bit of a dick tonight.

soccer,fcriwgc,t1_fcrhn9n,1577902410.0,Worst Spanish ever and yet somehow the whole conversation was understandable.
soccer,fcrg70l,t1_fcrfxog,1577901400.0,"Yeah, that's fair. Refs need to be consistent on those kinds of fouls or it encourages flopping."
soccer,fcrfjfp,t1_fcrf7os,1577901161.0,I am always amazed at how a player gets pulled by the arm and his legs stop working.
soccer,fcrdgqt,t1_fcrddsj,1577900350.0,Vale.  Thanks mate.
soccer,fcrd83b,t3_eikse1,1577900260.0,Is there a match thread for city and Everton?  I can't find it.
avfc,fcqu9sf,t3_eii2cf,1577892295.0,We have to trust that the video operator pauses the play at the exact moment the ball leaves the foot of the kicker. When it is this close a difference of one frame is the difference between onside and off. There needs to be a margin of error for onside I  think.
avfc,fcqmom3,t3_eihx16,1577888709.0,Check out the Brighton goal when you can.  Absolute cracker.

avfc,fcqk0t7,t3_eihx16,1577887363.0,From one angle it looked horrible but from the other angle it didn't look too bad.  Hope it is just a twist and nothing too serious like an acl.
avfc,fcqf3d7,t3_eihx16,1577884771.0,Villa 2 - VAR 1.

avfc,fcqd7fi,t3_eihx16,1577883681.0,Can't celebrate a goal properly until they kick off again. Excellent work finished by Wes.

avfc,fcqb9pp,t3_eihx16,1577882595.0,Captain Jack!!!!! Finally capitalising on opposition mistakes.  Keep going lads!

penguins,fcb74jf,t3_egmkxd,1577583231.0,"Murray almost undone again by a terrible turnover in the defensive end.  I don't know why, but this happens so much lately in front of Murray and when he let's in the goal we blame him for it. Stop coughing up the puck to wide open players and he might have an easier time of it."
penguins,fcb5dsk,t1_fcb5027,1577582568.0,I held onto him in my fantasy team after drafting him because I knew that he would come good eventually.

penguins,fcax9s2,t3_egmkxd,1577578434.0,"Don't tell me they are actually going to give Murray some goal support tonight?  I know Murray has let in some bad ones, but the amount of times the rest of the players have given him nothing in front of him is ridiculous."
