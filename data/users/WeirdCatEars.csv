If it’s something more of a rare treat then it should be longer than 10 minutes for sure.  I do feel like it needs to delve a bit more into the news they’re covering, like what we got in this ep plus a short summary which could lead to reactions to it. (which also makes it so the content gets a bit longer with less amount of news, which may be good for a regular series.)"
wholesomeyuri,ffgml5z,t1_ffftdsp,1579909736.0,"As a knee-long haired individual let me tell you it’s not that much of a pain if it’s straight enough that it’s not a nightmare to brush (if that’s the case it would be a nightmare to brush mid waist already), specially given the girl with unusually long hair keeps it tied in a braid. You get used to sweeping the hair to the side before sitting, but that kind of thing does not really need effort. (Or if you want to secure it a bit more you can sweep it around your neck in a sort of scarf)


 Unless it tends to be very greasy (most people’s hair gets greasier faster than it could because their scalps are used to being washed too often, but some people do have greasier hair faster regardless of routine), setting aside one afternoon a week to wash/dry the hair is enough. Or around two hours or so if you plan on using a hair dryer (which you don’t want to do if you can avoid it, because it damages the hair in the long run)."

Take it from someone whose first language is very binary, it sucks and it doesn’t fix the underlying issue, since sexist people just plain treat you with contempt when they know your gender through your title.
