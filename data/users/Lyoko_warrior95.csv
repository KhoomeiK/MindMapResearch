Paranormal,ffbic7x,t3_esgcf4,1579766644.0,"Wow. The things you experienced blows my ghost away. At my store, (in a Walmart btw) be seen shadows multiple times, a kid screaming from what it sounded like near the walk in freezer, had things fly off of shelves, such as a syrup case. This thing was flushed all the way back on top of the syrup shelf area. Like in the middle middle. I was doing prep one day and heard a loud SLAM next to me.  The 50+ pound case flew off of the shelf and 5 feet away from it standing straight up. 

I‚Äôve also had multiple people ask me if there is a new person working in the back. I tell them it‚Äôs just my boss, she comes in every so often to fix stuff. She‚Äôs blonde and short. But they meant a tall guy with short black hair. Regular clothes walking around in the back room... freaked me tf out and checked to make sure nobody was back there. There was nobody...  we see shadows walking around and through our door that leads to the back room. My cousin who works at the Walmart tells me that the walked by the store one night after the gates were locked, then saw a tall dark figure slightly hunched over one of the booths and disappeared.  Also had my shirt pulled while on the line."

I put the extra mayo on and he tells me to put more on. *3 more back and forth passes later.* he asks for more *3 passes back and forth* I end up putting the entire bottle of mayo on his sandwich. And then he asks me the question of the day.... ‚Äúdo you have light mayo too?‚Äù 

Story #2.

I‚Äôm at my home store and am on closing shift. (I‚Äôm in a Walmart btw.) this homeless guy lives in his truck in the parking lot and cones in every so often to ask for napkins or a fork or something. But one night, he decided to get a sandwich. Okay cool. Guess what he orders... a freakin tuna lol. So I put his pepper jack cheese on and ask him if he would like it toasted. He said no. I was actually relieved he did say no tbh. Then he said he would like it heated..... wait what????? So just when I‚Äôm about to pop it in the microwave, he tells me he wants lettuce, tomatoes, spinach, lots of olives, pickles, jalape√±os and mayo. Yes he wanted his sandwich microwaved with mayo!! Put in a pass or two and asked if that was enough. He said he wanted more and to stop when he said so.... okay....  7 full back and forth passes was what he stopped at. Then he told me to microwave it for 2:00. ü§¢ü§¢

I then take this monstrosity out of the microwave and worked up the courage to ask him without puking if there was anything else on it. ‚ÄúMore mayonnaise on the veggies..‚Äù in the end, 3/4 of my full bottle was gone. I somehow manage to close it up and wrap it without losing all of that precious mayo. As far as I know, he ate the whole thing..."

But it is always gong to be a concern when driving with Tourette‚Äôs. But things could turn out better than you think. My tics got generally more content after I turned 20.

I do t want to suggest drugs or any other supplements unless you are open to trying something of the sort. But CBIT is Likely the most effective treatment to help with the intense tics. It‚Äôs definitely not easy at all. Likely will be internally painful, but it can help you enough to get through school.  The only other thing I can suggest is trying to get into a program that will help you at your own pace. Not that you don‚Äôt know how to do the work, but physically can‚Äôt.  Or even have someone help you with your work while you are the one thinking and solving the problems on the sheet. Likely won‚Äôt happen with tis, but I guess I‚Äôm just throwing ideas out.

Other disorders that link with Tourette‚Äôs would usually be add adhd, depression, anxiety, social anxiety, insomnia, bipolar.  Some of these usually are developed due to Tourette‚Äôs being so physically and mentally exhausting, the social exclusion in some cases, embarrassment, physical pain on a daily basis without any sign of going away,  your mind is always on maximum overdrive with nothing but loud and intrusive thoughts that never go away.  

Basically, on the surface, Tourette‚Äôs is just a person who twitches, moves around a lot and makes random sounds. But underneath is like an iceberg. There is more going on than meets the eye. 

Here‚Äôs a link to what I mean about the iceberg.

socialanxiety,fdayl6j,t1_fd9s7pr,1578251837.0,Ouch man... I know that feeling... I‚Äôve been zoned like that more times then I‚Äôd like to count. Luckily girls I‚Äôm into already show that they aren‚Äôt interested before I make a major move. Such as talking about a guy they are wanting to date or just a straight brother zone.  But I gave up due to what you went through. Not fun... and women wonder why men don‚Äôt approach a pretty girl these days... we don‚Äôt want to creep them out and we want to save the pain.

WouldYouRather,fd7t4hq,t3_ek4yie,1578209685.0,"I would rather regret not doing something most of the time, not doing something and regretting it doesn‚Äôt have as many personal repercussions vs regretting doing something. Regretting doing something would be in a sense of something you did that was wrong and should not have done in the first place, such as driving too fast while drunk or punching someone or worse.... Not doing something would be like not studying for a test or not making a move On Girl you like."
socialanxiety,fd7sn84,t1_fd7is1e,1578209475.0,"I know what you mean. I never had anyone to talk to about my anxiety issues, much less my social anxiety.  I‚Äôve tried to talk to people, even my family about it, but nobody really seems to care enough to help me out or even genuinely listen. They just give me that response of ‚Äúoh, that‚Äôs not good... I‚Äôm sorry....‚Äù ok. Yah thanks. I‚Äôm glad you are sympathetic but I need words of some kind of support to show that you at least care... that‚Äôs exactly why I don‚Äôt talk about it. They don‚Äôt care."
socialanxiety,fd7s5c0,t1_fd7gg7f,1578209251.0,This is the truest sentence I‚Äôve read all night.... it has become one of the soul reasons why I have been single for so long. I gave up on even trying to approach anyone anymore.

The only good thing about having this disorder is that those of us who don‚Äôt want to join the military won‚Äôt be forced to go.  Going to only say this once though.... Tourette‚Äôs FTW!"
