The vast majority of us care very much about these aircraft.   We do fly in them, our families fly on them, our friends fly on them.  Every hit like this on the aviation industry comes back to all of us.  

In this case there were a lot of failures along the way that allowed it to happen, and trust me, theres a reason why this is a case study for us in how to prevent this sort of thing in the now and the future.


So respectfully shove off with this ""they don't care"" bull."

AskReddit,feyoizr,t3_eqpqjr,1579448320.0,"I did one year at a big state university as an Aviation student.  My roommate's brother happened to deal in...illicit substances.  One day while I'm sitting at my desk playing CounterStrike he comes in and slaps something on his desk behind me, opens the window, and within moments I'm smelling some of the most pungent smoke I'd ever experienced.  

Turning around, I saw him drawing on a pipe and on his desk was a *full* brick of ""high-quality"" No-Dak weed.

""Dude!  You can't smoke that in here!  I'm in the aviation program, what if they test me?!"" 

Grudgingly he admitted I was right and took his brick and pipe downstairs to his buddy.

About an hour later, there was a knock at the door. It was one of his buddies.

""Heyyyy, man...[roomate] said you've got good up here....got anything I can eat?""

He was right.  I did; I always kept a stocked cupboard even in the dorms.  

""Yeah.... I've got some crackers...""

""Yo, I'll pay for that.""

""Okay. 5 bucks.""

He hands me a 5.  Then I think for a moment.  ""I've got some cheezwiz too....five bucks.""

""Oh hell yeah!""

Do a wiggle check, check the runs, lube all the things, and exercise the controls again.  Moves better now? Slap a signature on her and call it a day.
