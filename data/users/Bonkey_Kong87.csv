There sure were lots of pros and cons in the whole Konami happening. Also a lot of stuff we don't know and probably never will know. I'm not sucking his dick because of no Homo, but he is pretty much one of the greatest minds when it comes to Videogames/movies. At least if you are into that kind of special genre.
