Lyrics:

Lines form on my face and hands
Lines form from the ups and downs
I'm in the middle without any plans
I'm a boy and I'm a man
I'm eighteen, and I don't know what I want
Eighteen, I just don't know what I want
Eighteen, I gotta get away
I've gotta get out of this place
I'll go runnin' in outer space, oh yeah
I've got a baby's brain and an old man's heart
Took eighteen years to get this far
Don't always know what I'm talkin' about
Feels like I'm livin' in the middle of doubt
'Cause I'm eighteen, I get confused every day
Eighteen, I just don't know what to say
Eighteen, I gotta get away
Woah, lines form on my face and my hands
Lines form on the left and right
I'm in the middle, the middle of life
I'm a boy and I'm a man
I'm eighteen and I like it
Yes, I like it
Oh, I like it, love it, like it, love it
Eighteen, eighteen, eighteen, eighteen and I like it"

It‚Äôs important that you realize you do not at all need to be charismatic. You just need to have the courage to stand up for you and the other workers. 

First thing, typically you would find a union to represent you guys. (I might be able to suggest one if you can tell me what industry you work in)... then you would typically need to get union cards signed. I believe that the minimum is about a third by law... but unions usually want about two thirds before they will bring it to the NLRB (National Labor Relations Board). 

Once you get the cards signed and the cards are submitted to the NLRB, the government (NLRB) will come in to hold an election. 

If the union wins, then you start to work on a contract to negotiate. 

A few words of advice... do a lot of research before you actually start anything... Know your rights and know how the company will likely respond. This will increase your likelihood of success. 

I suggest you research ‚Äúunion busting‚Äù so you can prepare for the garbage that likely will come your way.

Also, check out the website for the National Labor Relations Board www.nlrb.gov 

Perseverance is key. Don‚Äôt give up just when things aren‚Äôt going your way. Good luck!"
antiwork,fdc7i8q,t1_fdc5i1y,1578268619.0,"Well, first of all, there are unfortunately some poorly run unions. However, it‚Äôs important for people to recognize that in the workplace, the workers are the union. The workers need to be active for the whole thing to work. The union officials represent the workers and they can only do a good job for the workers if they got strong backing from the workers. (And if union officials are doing a poor job... it means they needed to be voted out or the workers need a different union.)"
