3Dprinting,ff371k7,t1_ff2tcp8,1579535218.0,"I am working on a similar project that [Maker’s Muse](https://youtu.be/MeYuIWGqquE) did using arcade buttons but the Arduino bit is likely very similar.

You just need to make sure to use a Leonardo or Micro, something with the ATmega32u4 that can be flashed as a keyboard or as a midi controller.  

I initially did a map for f13-f21 to test it out for now but it can be programmed with a variety of options just by editing in the Arduino IDE."
3Dprinting,fewj6cm,t1_few1c9z,1579411646.0,"It was back up into my heaterblock with the dark bits from the filament that somehow didn’t pass through. I think I may have been running it too low from the get-go.

Initially tried heating up to around 250 then let cool to do a cold pull. 

Then, I tried to pull the nozzle and used a torch heat it up and try to soften the clog from the inside to try to pull the little bit there from the input side.

In the end, replacing a nozzle wasn’t a big deal other than downtime."

3Dprinting,fev2gag,t1_feunnwp,1579392352.0,"I had to replace my .4mm nozzle after about halfway through the roll using this filament. It ran great until it didn’t on a Monoprice Maker Select. 

Tried but I couldn’t burn it out even.

Haven’t tried going back since more recently upgrading to an all metal hotend since I switched to printing just PETG after that.  

I do still have the rest of that roll though, maybe I should try again."
wholesomebpt,feu5fks,t1_fetfjwt,1579383314.0,"Going to school after a long break can be tough, but even more fulfilling.

Experiencing life then taking classes in my opinion is a better experience. You may already have a sense of what you don’t know and things you may want to learn to get better at what you do, or you just may want to do something else and are learning more.

The important thing is not overwhelm yourself, it’s easy.  If you keep your goals in mind and keep to schedules and plans, it is easier to do school in chunks instead of constantly feeling like you are drowning.

Good luck on your continued education and trying to improve!"

bulletjournal,fdapfik,t1_fd9zbbp,1578248682.0,"That’s so funny, my middle school science teacher a few decades back told me that I should practice handwriting during spring break because it was sloppy. 

At first it was annoying but I had nothing better to do so I knuckled down and practiced for a solid week.  

Two and five were especially bad for me because I wrote them the same as Z and S and for some reason 4 and R were indistinguishable from each other.

Even to this day, I will just write random phrases from books or interesting things I hear onto post-it’s as practice and leave them in various hidden spots.

I still thank Mr. Johnson wherever he is for impressing upon me the importance of a legible script."

Personally, I have been particular about keeping each tea variety separate in bags but wonder if that is unneeded."

esist,fc9ffc6,t3_egqipa,1577551887.0,"Seems like Mitch is doing everything he can to keep his job, he went hardline early on to get power. Now he has power. He used that power to control the narrative. 

But it now seems he’s reached a point where he can’t control it.

So what’s the next step? He can allow the things congress wants and lose his sense of control and potential voter base, which I am confident he won’t.

Ruling out the notion of him being affected by outside parties, whether it be perceived deep state assassins or hopeful but questionable pardons in his mind, I am just thinking this guy has in his mind “I got power by doing this... so I keep doing this” and has no other mental option.

It really makes you wonder, how does this frak sleep at night?"
