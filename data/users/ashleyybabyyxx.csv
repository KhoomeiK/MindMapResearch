Instagramreality,fewjpuw,t1_fet5th7,1579412035.0,I KNOW!! I see her too and I‚Äôm absolutely baffled by it.
cats,fejh3jb,t3_eovkbq,1579173950.0,"Just an update everyone, sorry I didn‚Äôt post yesterday. It was a rough day. More tests are needed but the vet‚Äôs thinking thought is that it‚Äôs Lymphoma, and the news about killed me. Her calcium level came back super high again and it has to go to the lab (it was at 15 which made them re-test, 7 is normal). Ultrasound shows a mass under her heart and the mass on her thyroid that the vet felt. She also has some mineralization in her kidneys, but we are not sure if that was lack of eating or what. She does have an abscessed tooth in the back that was supposed to be removed and the blood work for that to make sure she could tolerate anesthesia sent us down this rabbit hole.
 
Holding out hope and we take her back in 2 weeks for an update. She FINALLY ate yesterday (baby food and she was HUNGRY!!!) so I am happy about that. I think she was having issues eating prior because of her tooth. She‚Äôs on prednisone, an antibiotic and pain meds. She seemed very happy last night.

I am having a REALLY hard time and kind of refuse to believe this. The vet said she has maybe a month, but without a biopsy they don‚Äôt know *for sure* that it‚Äôs cancer. Without that (which I‚Äôm not comfortable doing since we‚Äôve already spent 2k and a biopsy could put her at risk for further infection and she may not come out of anesthesia), they will treat ‚Äúpreventatively‚Äù, i.e. the steroids and all until her labs come back and in 2 weeks when we go back we‚Äôll determine a care plan. 

She is acting normal now that we have gotten food into her so again, I am holding on to hope as long as I possibly can and maybe she‚Äôll come through this and we‚Äôll have longer. I know she‚Äôs older, but other than her tooth she‚Äôs not in pain and has no other visible symptoms. It‚Äôs day like these when I‚Äôm so grateful my wife works from home. I‚Äôve had Fluffernutter since she was a baby but she definitely has taken to her other mom over the years and she‚Äôs the favorite.

Thank you everyone for your kind words and support. I‚Äôll continue to update here. üíñ"

cats,fefogar,t1_fefdnju,1579060840.0,"I cannot express how incredibly sorry I am for your loss and I am sending every ounce of love and good karma I have your way. No one prepares you for this. My wife and I lost a lot of loved ones last year‚Äî 2019 was top 3 one of my worst years and I just kind of became numb to death. But this is a completely different world for me, one that I never even imagined, stupidly. She‚Äôs been my only constant for 16 years. I love her more than anything, and I always (half jokingly) tell my wife that she‚Äôll always be second to my cat. I am definitely loving and holding Fluffernutter against her will for as long as I can.

I truly wish you the best and all of my condolences, and again, I cannot express how much I appreciate your kind words. üíö"

She‚Äôs the same, feisty kitten I brought home all those years ago. She‚Äôs been the only constant in my life since I was 12. And again, sorry to dump this all on strangers‚Äî I appreciate everyone‚Äôs words and listening. I‚Äôm just in shock."

I‚Äôm also sorry to throw this all on a stranger, I just literally cannot even fathom what‚Äôs happening right now. 2019 was a lot of death in my wife and I‚Äôs family and I kind of became numb to it. This is so much harder and almost just completely unfathomable to me. I know she‚Äôs a cat, but she‚Äôs my world, and has been for 16 years."
