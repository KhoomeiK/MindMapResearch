DataHoarder,ffbzhej,t3_eso9y3,1579787593.0,"This was a thing back in the BBS days.  I remember file trading parties where maybe 15 people would get together and trade files that were stored on QIC-40, QIC-80, DAT tapes, and CDs.

Once high speed internet in the home became a thing, and we went away from 56k modems it moved to the FTP scene and they kind of died off, at least in my circles.

I remember get togethers even in the 80s trading stuff on cassette and floppy too, mostly for 8-bit computers like the TRS-80 and Apple II's.  Actually it started for in me the late 70s with 500 baud cassettte tapes.

The movie title was originally going to be titled Betelgeuse (it is the actual name of the character in the movie) but the studio hated the name (they wanted to change it to House Ghosts) because they thought nobody would go see a movie with a name they couldn't pronounce.  

Burton refused to change the name but eventually relented somewhat and let them just change the spelling.  

The reason he was named Betelgeuse in the first place was because Betelgeuse is supposed to be the doorway to the infinite blackness of outer space, a metaphor for Betelgeuse being the doorman of the underworld.
