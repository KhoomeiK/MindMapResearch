TaylorSwift,fd0141d,t3_ejg5rj,1578112064.0,"I think this is really interesting. I would never of thought about Reputation this way. Whenever I listen to Taylor Swift, I think about the surface meaning. I never dig deep to realise the powerful reasoning behind her songs. Thank you for bringing your opinion to my attention. I won't think of her music the same way ever again.

I understand what you are saying when you say that Reputation is more romantic the Lover. I cannot say whether I agree or disagree. If you don't think about with too much thought,Love is the ablum based around love and LGBTQ+. While Reputation, as you say, is 'dark'. Reputation is a Delicate album, where her claws come out and her true, powerful beauty is shown in a different way. A way Taylor Swift hasn't expressed herself before."
