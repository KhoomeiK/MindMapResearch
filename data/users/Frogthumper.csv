vegangifrecipes,ffera9v,t3_et4gjx,1579861618.0,"This looks proper manky, it looks so greasy! If I wanted to drink half a bottle of oil with my meal, I'd go and get some takeaway chips. I don't see the point in brutalising roasted vegetables like that, they're lovely as they are! What have they ever done to you to deserve that treatment?"
AmItheAsshole,ff9fqqt,t1_ff9e3dq,1579712052.0,"I never said they did, I'm just pointing out that clearly the woman doesn't have 1000s of comments, cos she would have quoted them all if she had. She can't let go of one stupid, cruel comment a teenager said years ago, that woman has issues.  All teenagers say stupid, cruel things. If my mum held against me even half of the shit I said as an angry teenager, we would never have spoken to each other again!"

Not entirely true, we're given one example: ""When he was 16, he told me I had a toxic uterus because I was apparently a cold woman. This was when he found out about my infertility issues.""

But only one. I feel like if he was as consistently awful as she claims, there would be a whole list of grievances."

Yesssssss, that would be genius. I want Brian Blessed to try mascara and lipstick and get it wrong and be adorably bashful about it. And wearing a leather dress with an axe covered in sequins!"

AskWomen,feg6uos,t1_feeiwwk,1579079754.0,"It's normal though, the younger you are, the more effort you put into looking and dressing ""professional"" because you feel like you have more to prove and want people to take you seriously. A few years down the line and you've proven your worth and feel more confident, so you don't need to try as hard with your outfit."
fatlogic,feg6nq5,t1_fef6bkb,1579079480.0,I know this is going to sound very crunchy but kombucha works like a laxative for me.
fatlogic,fedqibf,t1_fedm7t9,1579017701.0,Just a thought - but could tighter regulations on calorie counts be the cause? I know there have been changes recently to legislation to make calorie counts on packages more accurate. Maybe they were fudging their numbers all along and are having to be more honest to avoid a fine?

CalorieEstimates,fdjmziv,t3_elec9d,1578478761.0,"So, I'm going off the Chipotle nutrition calculator, because I don't think an independent store will be wildly different and because it's huge I'm pretty much doubling everything except the tortilla: 

Tortilla: 320 cals 

Pulled Pork: 340 cals 

Rice: 420 cals

Blacks beans: 260 cals 

Cheese: 220 cals

Sour cream/guacamole: 220 cals

Tortilla chips: 200 cals 

Total 1 980 cals for a very generous estimate"
