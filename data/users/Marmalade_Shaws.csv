mildlyinteresting,fe7p6xd,t1_fe6oqha,1578917619.0,I don't think that's a cold thing so much as a failure on the ice cube. You should return it to the manufacturer and get a replacement cube.

You're their world and all you have to do is be there and they're the happiest thing. They don't need explanations, or require you to talk extensively. You never feel like you have to navigate them like with people. I totally get that.

aww,fe7k9dk,t1_fdyknk1,1578915762.0,Thanks. She's pretty awesome. Oddly she's neurotic and stresses out a lot but I think the act of comforting her is what comforts me? Odd right? Kind of a nurture thing I think.
aww,fe7k3d1,t1_fdz5c5h,1578915689.0,"Not really lol. I can go out just fine. But the senses sometimes get overwhelmed. Things sound too loud, colors are too bright. Kinda get this headache and then this tightness in the chest. Like something really heavy is on top of me. Can't breathe and the next thing I know my mind is scrambling for the nearest shelter. Fight or flight over nothing and I end up feeling a bit foolish. But I can't logic it away sadly. I wish I could. I know it's silly on paper but the feelings are just so intense. It's insane."

It's why I'm so thankful for the internet. I can interact and see the world without having to subject myself to the stress. But honestly I'd love to see it in person. But even now I'd be content just to go down to the gas station on the he corner and buy some random shit like a normal person without making staff thinking I'm there to lift everything."
aww,fe7ja0j,t1_fdzddty,1578915326.0,Yea. Pretty much. Going outside itself doesn't bother me too much. It's being near crowded public places. Streets and sidewalks and markets just like you said in your example.
aww,fe7j587,t1_fdyuuvp,1578915268.0,"Basically the way I had it explained is that it's a general fear of going out or being in public spaces. The actual act of going out isn't the issue for me. I can leave my house and wander my property. But I generally get this overwhelmed feeling if that makes sense: colors are too bright, noises are too loud, etc. I love the sun and the outdoors it just gets to me sometimes?

Other people are the clincher for me. I can't really be around people I don't know unless I feel I'm in a place I can control the situation...? Had a lot of crappy experiences as a kid so my outward trust is kinda bare. But I know it's an emotional thing and it logically doesn't make sense. But emotions aren't supposed to I guess. I know most people are good inherently and aren't out to get you but sometimes a funky look and I'm boarding my door up. I try and laugh about it but it's just shit really. 

Hope that helped ha ha"

mildlyinteresting,fe7homz,t1_fe6o5xj,1578914623.0,Mine did too! Where I live rats try and nest every year in from the fields. They end up eating insulation and it just makes the whole place freezing.

aww,fdygx8b,t1_fdyd9ex,1578779638.0,Not technically prison but I have a bit of agoraphobia and leaving the house is usually hard and I end up overdoing it on sedatives. I got a German Shepherd puppy a bit over a year ago and she's the only one who doesn't make my house feel like a cage. She gives me confidence to go outside and walk her.

fightporn,fdu7jd7,t3_en0vrn,1578728951.0,"This reminds of an incident I had with my dad when I was younger. We had an amazing relationship before he died of cancer in 2013 but early on I was a brat who could've been a lawyer; stacking arguments carefully and if one thing wasn't said right my point had been made. I'd drag him down off the pedestal of adulthood and make him argue with me like a child. Part of got a kick out of it or something... I digress...

One night I'm being particularly mouthy with him. He's doing his best to be patient and tells me to go to my room. Instead I get in front of him while he's trying to focus on the TV instead of the steam coming out of his ears and he finally breaks and begins arguing back. Then I blow him off and walk to my room. Him following. I slammed the door in his face; in my naivety I thought my room could protect me. Fuck no. 

Cracking wood and next thing I know the door is pulled off its hinges, wood and splinters hanging from the wall. I was genuinely scared. He never hit me though. He made his point by walking outside and throwing it across the yard. Mom got mad at him and argument ensued to which he resigned to sleeping on the couch. 

After I'd fallen asleep I was told he felt so bad he ended up sleeping on the floor next to my bed with his arm on me üò≠"

todayilearned,fd1skcz,t1_fd1ibo9,1578136142.0,"I'm not sure what version of history you're referring to, but the middle ages nor the Renaissance were particularly peaceful. Periods of peace maybe but still lots of conflict. Like I said, humans have been fighting since the dawn of time. 

The United States has had a rough start; breaking free from a tyrannical monarchy through a devastating and bloody war, a period of inner conflict with the Civil War, the Civil Rights movement, the Cuban Missile Crisis, etc. The US has been in struggle for a long time and it's only been around for a short period compared to other countries. Impressively it's become one of the world's leading superpowers in that short period which is insane.

It's a young country and has yet to, historically, experience a long enough era of peace to say it has been in conflict less than 93% of its history. What are you trying to say?"
todayilearned,fd1eg4p,t3_ejsi3r,1578130423.0,"I don't believe this is referencing the United States' culture but history. Still got to remember despite the size and influence the US has it's still one of the youngest countries in the world. Other countries have histories spanning thousands of years. The United States was only formed some 243 years ago. It would make sense that its entire history is steeped in conflict because it hasn't been around long enough (and there hasn't been a particularly long era of peace on Earth) for it to be considered otherwise. 

Plus, humans have been fighting since the dawn of their creation. While we're not born with hate, we [humans] have a strong disposition and propensity for violence. We can paint and sing and divine meaning from nothing but we're still animals, apes to be precise, and just because we can understand and recognize that doesn't give us the ability to change our very evolution. We can, however, fight against natural programming and work toward peace."

askgaybros,fbj9jdb,t3_ecuisi,1576928284.0,"Yes. I think it has to do with curiosity mainly. The allure of mystery and suspense is present in almost all humans, straight or gay; it'd be no stretch to assume that a scantily clad woman is on par with a scantily clad man. The mild showing of pubes, or even a naval (good lordy, those V-shapes!) gives not only a hint of sexuality but, I believe, subconsciously engages the mind. You're imagining what is under the cloth, that taboo-ness of nakedness and sex, your mind is working overdrive here imo. So when I see a hot guy who has all but pants on, showing some groin cleavage, I'm going to immediately be more turned on than if I just see some dude buck naked.   


The clothes add a layer of mystery to the equation that satisfies my never-ending curiosity. Not only that, Psychology  has supposedly found that it isn't the presence of visible genitalia that turns us humans on, more so that it is the positioning of the body; body language that communicates sexual desire rather than just the presence of sexual organs.  To that, I'd say not only would the guy have to be naked, but he'd/they'd also have to be positioned in a way that shows off their sexual features (e.g. extension of the ass, raising of the arms, general positions that show not only vulnerability, but a desire to engage in sex) if I would liken a plain naked person to a guy who has all but some pubes or naval peaking over his pants.

PS: I'm drunk and I write for fun, so this probably was way more over-explained than it needed to be; my apologies.  


**TL;DR: I think shirtless hot guys showing off their pubes from beneath their pants is hotter than a plain naked guy**"
