I like being my own person and, if people don't like it, fuck 'em. I do what I want to do and live the same way. Once we die, it's all over. Also, I don't fake smile anymore either. It starts to feel unnatural."

It was nice because it was years since that happened. This year, I will be alone again with my family sending me wishes. Fuck me."
