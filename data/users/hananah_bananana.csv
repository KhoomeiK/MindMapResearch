dogs,ffcjj1l,t3_estlgm,1579800805.0,"Got close to being cornered by the German Shepard in our building last night. Was getting my keys out to go inside and I happen to look to the left and see the dog pulling the girl toward us. Luckily I quickly got Willow inside and all she got was a little ruff in. Such a good girl learning to react less. Those owners have no control over that dog and it’s very obvious. I’ve seen the dog pull her to another dog 40-50 feet away. 

This is the same owner I told not to let our dogs meet and she let the dog pull her over anyways. That dog is going to hurt someone or something one day because they don’t do enough to get his energy out/train."
dogs,ffchva1,t1_ffc2nij,1579799797.0,"Haha we do what we call doggy pushups! She doesn’t have a cue to jump although sometimes will if we ask for “monkey” (dance on the hind legs). But we go for sit, down and then feet (stand). Hard to keep her guessing for what’s next so maybe I’ll throw in “monkey” tonight."
bayarea,ff884y6,t1_ff86g04,1579668758.0,Ugh I’m sorry! Have you followed up with them at all via email? They are also active in Instagram and Facebook.
bayarea,ff7tecq,t1_ff7p7iy,1579657908.0,"Seconded. We got our dog there a year ago. When we filled out the application they were good at letting us know what dogs would work for our living situation (both work full time away from home). 

They won’t know all the dogs issues (if any) of course, but it is nice they aren’t all stressed out from shelter life."
reactivedogs,ff6xhnc,t3_ers4g1,1579636907.0,Willow has been doing well with her reactivity as we move forward in training. A unit at the front of our building has a new dog that they are definitely not training (they leave their porch door open for him even though he barks at every dog passing by and then half heartedly try to call him back). So his barking has actually been great for working with Willow. After class next weekend we are supposed to start mixing in group classes.
dogs,ff6d20g,t1_ff63pta,1579624548.0,Oh squirrels are a tough one. I swear Willow can see one 100 yards away sometimes.
seriouseats,ff5d2zc,t3_eqzeji,1579587882.0,Went and had this today! Also had the deviled eggs. I’ve been a few times and it’s always been great.
dogs,ff3czzt,t3_erdo6e,1579538677.0,Sticking Willow In daycare today since her humans are off work and want a break lol. We decided we wouldn’t try trazodone for her isolation anxiety until we felt comfortable with her reactivity training progress. So daycare outings are what we have for now!
dogs,ff3c7aj,t1_ff3b4uf,1579538273.0,Oh no that’s horrible :(
Baking,ff2bfze,t3_er7oke,1579499622.0,These look perfect for training! How did you make them? My dog loves liver treats.
dogs,fez2auz,t1_feyv8a7,1579453189.0,Ha! We’re using it in the car because she gets so anxious seeing other people or dogs or whatever walk by the car and she likes to try to get in the front so this is better than nothing. She was fine if we weren’t driving but whined when we moved. So dunno how this will go lol
dogs,feyrkyt,t3_eqwncc,1579449756.0,"Worked in training for the car crate yesterday let’s just Willow was [not a fan.](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7gbnL1JhcO/?igshid=17az9j9m6q38c) lol

We got lunch (mm ceviche) and went to a quiet park. Willow worked on her reactivity when a couple dogs went by which wasn’t too bad and she played with the flirt pole a little bit. 

We’ll be doing her breakfast while training in the Costco parking lot this morning while one of us shops. Lots of new environments."
dogs,feyr3e2,t1_feyg6sr,1579449568.0,Aww they are best buds!
dogs,fet1p2h,t3_eqgsqb,1579370989.0,Since there’s no session with the trainer today we’ll be working on getting Willow used to her new car crate (hoping it calms her anxiety) and going to new places to work on leash reactivity. Willow isn’t feeling well again and we think it’s the brand of hot dogs we got this time. So forget the healthy chicken dogs and we’ll go back to the unhealthy ones! I’ll take her out again later this morning and maybe then she’ll want her breakfast.
dogs,fepii0m,t1_feowuph,1579321362.0,"We got trazodone recently but haven’t tried it yet. We’ve had willow about a year and she has a lot of general anxiety. At first I didn’t want to medicate her long term, but now I’m coming around to it because I’d rather have her happy and medicated than an anxious mess the rest of her hopefully long life."
dogs,fenb9bm,t3_eq0u51,1579280983.0,"We got a flirt pole! It was quite hard to find one without a squeaker in it. She goes to town destroying toys and even more so with a squeaker in it. We found one that is just fleece and she took to it right away. Hopefully she keeps up interest so we work on more exercise (since she never seems to get physically tired. Only mentally). 

I also want to get her a balance disc to work on body awareness. Apparently if you want one marketed for dogs it’s 3x the cost of just a human one. 

No training session this week so we’ll be taking Willow various places to work on our training ourselves. It’s a 3 day weekend so lots of time for that!"
dogs,fejuzag,t3_epjsw5,1579186459.0,"Willow has been not listening well the past 2 days. I know dogs have moods too but ugh it’s annoying. She just can go from 0 to 100 so fast sometimes in terms of ignoring you. Last nights potty walk I had to drag her away cuz she was growling at another dog (yay leash reactivity) and then I tripped over her. As soon as I recovered myself she was attentive. Like didn’t want to leave my side to pee attentive. 

She’s also been moody about her kibble. She didn’t want to eat until we went on our 9pm walk so she only ate half her dinner while we did that. She normally loves her kibble so I guess she still isn’t feeling well from lash weekend."
AskWomen,feixg1g,t1_fei42qj,1579149893.0,Similar to me but it’s a cigar. It takes me back to sitting on the porch on warm summer nights with my papa. My mom used to tell me to sit near him to keep the bugs away.
dogs,fehcgof,t1_fehanxf,1579113712.0,Our 2 yo mutt does the same kind of sighs. We move in bed? Sigh. I move on the couch? Sigh. I tell her to lay down in the car? Sigh.
dogs,fedqr2z,t3_eolqbc,1579017856.0,Willow has been doing so well now that we are using the slip lead full time outside. She’s learning to always be engaged with us which is great and yesterday she only barked once then was being all cute looking at me going into daycare. Silly girl.
dogs,febyj7u,t1_febvjug,1578964327.0,Seriously. Spent so much on our dog last head and she’s only 2 years old.
waiting_to_try,fe9v21h,t1_fe9slhu,1578941729.0,We had some in Hong Kong that’s was flown in daily and it was amazing!
dogs,fe9abf6,t1_fe8mbgd,1578935809.0,Someone in our building has a GS puppy (9 months old I think). From our limited interaction they let that dog pull them everywhere. I was going into our building Saturday with Willow and she let her dog get close enough to sniff even though I told her no. Willow is reactive but luckily was so tired from training that she did okay. That dog is going to run up to the wrong dog soon.
waiting_to_try,fe969z9,t3_eo6g08,1578934740.0,We are going to Japan in April. We’ve been wanting to go but obviously I don’t want to be pregnant there because I want all the sushi. I’ll take my IUD out right when we get back.
dogs,fe8nihp,t1_fe8ehqp,1578928285.0,"Willow has had an upset stomach it seems. She’s pooped so much this weekend. But being the good girl she is has had no accidents. Poor girl. Maybe it was the hot dogs? 

She’s also been super sneaky getting into our bed in the middle of the night. We’ve been lazy about enforcing her sleeping in her own bed and now I wake up and have to put her back. Gotta get more strict because that girl does not know how to share lol

Edit: whoops sorry didn’t mean to reply to you directly!"
dogs,fe8mt58,t1_fe82fe1,1578928059.0,I’m in the Bay but we went through a private rescue and paid $325 for a young adult dog.
reactivedogs,fe8llpk,t3_eo1rqy,1578927592.0,Willow is progressing so well with the trainer. Saturday we had 2 other dogs out and about around her and while she still has her anxious whining she only had like one major freak out. We’ve been doing practice walks with her at potty time too.
dogs,fe3vx8k,t1_fe3lcln,1578853354.0,Thank you!
dogs,fe32idi,t3_ennwwt,1578845261.0,"Willow did [so well](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7MPSgcpGgI/?igshid=1qo4dgfsvrfn6)  yesterday even though we pushed her pretty hard for our second training session. The last 15 minutes we went outside and the trainers dog plus another dog were out there. Took one big freak out and then we were mostly good. We’re working on getting the barking to stop first/getting engagement and we’ll work on the whining later. 

In the afternoon we went to an area with no dogs and did another training session trying to make things fun for her while working on her heel. Then we went to a pet store that was closing and she did really well in there too with a handful of dogs around. Paid $81 for a bunch of treats and stuff which was great. 

Proud dog mom right now."
reactivedogs,fdzxnxo,t3_enhim3,1578798316.0,Willow is so quick to pick up on tricks which I think we are realizing that she loves to work. Also as we’ve done 2 sessions with our new trainer we’ve realized her work drive applies to sports too. She’s loving the agility we do in class and would love something like barn burn if we can find something close. She’s also super sweet once she knows you. Last week a new (to her) friend came over and after her initial “this is my house” she was like oh someone new to cuddle next to!
dogs,fdztjc9,t1_fdz47yr,1578795452.0,I didn’t realize reactivity was so common until I got further into this sub. Definitely makes you feel like you’re not alone.
dogs,fdwam4x,t3_en7tuf,1578756746.0,Training day! More practice with the slip lead and agility equipment. Maybe her afternoon walk we’ll practice outside with jt too?
TrollXChromosomes,fdrrtfb,t1_fdrc6u2,1578688806.0,I’m a 38D but get the DD-DDD one because I can trim it as needed.
Dogtraining,fdr31dg,t3_emtc3f,1578678814.0,I’ll be the one that it hasn’t worked for. Willow is so determined to pull ahead that she gets indents on her nose from the gentle lead. So it won’t work for everyone. They can also hurt their neck if they go running off while you are holding the leash as their head will whip back (it’s happened to us with her prey drive).
TrollXChromosomes,fdnn7ej,t1_fdn1dnx,1578589294.0,"I bought some of those sticky bra things instead. Basically boob tape but it covers your whole boob. I can jump around and they hardly move. Plus you can trim them after putting them on if you have a revealing dress.

Edit: [I used this one. ](https://www.brassybra.com/)"
dogs,fdnm253,t3_ema4ga,1578588624.0,"Last nights potty walk included some “agility” on the playground our apartment complex just put in. We won’t be able to do that at night in the summer since I’m sure kids will be on it later but for now it was fun. She got some good sniffs around it too. 

Last week Willow found the spine of some animal? It looked too long to be a squirrel so maybe a bird dropped it. It took some encouragement but I got Willow to eventually leave it alone. Well apparently someone (or rather something) broke up the spine and she found one piece this morning and ate it. So hopefully it won’t cause her any issues."
TrollXChromosomes,fdmhrl6,t1_fdltkb9,1578550352.0,My husband laughs at me because I have to pee twice before bed but now I know I’m not alone!
puppy101,fdkngji,t1_fdkhoev,1578507220.0,Same. I see fresh piles less than 20 steps from the free bags and trash can.
xxfitness,fdj8tbc,t1_fdj6wfd,1578461758.0,Oh that’s interesting that you found women’s shoes narrow. I have a pair but find that after 25ish minutes my toes get a little numb and I think it’s because they are too narrow. I just haven’t wanted to put up the cash for another pair yet.
reactivedogs,fdgy0dk,t3_el963o,1578411100.0,Willow got a solid B last night. It would have been an A but she freaked out when another dog surprised us and I wasn’t ready. She calmed down as soon as I remembered how to correct her though. We actually were able to walk with an unseen dog barking at us which was great. We just kept working on our heels and sits as we went and I got so much engagement from Willow.
reactivedogs,fdetkhh,t3_ekkz5g,1578346313.0,"Willow (and her humans) started with a new trainer last weekend. In just the first 1:1 we were able to bring another dog into the room and I got Willow to engage with me as we moved slowly closer. Training is just as much for the humans as it is the dog because it’s really helpful to have someone correct how and when you reward. Willow has such drive to please and work that I know she’s going to do well. 

We still have a trial of trazodone just in case but I think it’s more so needed for her isolation anxiety."
dogs,fddtqn5,t3_ekum88,1578323750.0,"Willow enjoyed her off leash hike yesterday and just ran circles around us as usual getting to all the smells. Her recall was pretty good too which is great. She did get a little bratty towards the end but that happens when she gets tired. My husband had to carry her to the car because her leash reactivity was worse being tired but she had done pretty well going into the park so I’ll take it. 

[She and her friend Ember](https://www.instagram.com/p/B69W_zxJb3w/?igshid=fiey1nogak9y)  found some rodent tunnels and dug their little hearts out. Good little terriers haha."
dogs,fddt4un,t1_fddp7ak,1578323310.0,Saw your pics on IG. Looks like a fun hike!
dogs,fddt0jp,t1_fddr0r0,1578323223.0,That’s great on the reactions!
dogs,fdcphja,t3_ekkp37,1578280762.0,Willow is a mutt but does a couple things by instinct. She points and tracks birds or squirrels as they go by. Today she did something new which was start digging while in a park. We encouraged her since she doesn’t do it often (we wanted to mark it) and when she got down a little bit turns out there were rodent tunnels of some kind. She was so ready to go face first into those tunnels if she had been smaller haha
dogs,fdcp8ov,t1_fdc8cq0,1578280580.0,I have a terrier mutt and she does this too. She’s pretty prey driven so when she sees something interesting she likes to point.
weddingplanning,fdacqdk,t3_ekfe0g,1578244670.0,We had a brunch wedding and still had a lot of dancing but we knew from our guest list we would have a lot of dancers.
dogs,fda61uf,t3_ekdga5,1578242190.0,"Going to try Willow on an off leash hike today. There’s a park that has an area in the middle that’s meant to be off leash. Hopefully she has a good day and sticks by us as we’re going with one of her best friends. 

After training yesterday we worked on our homework and she was really attentive. We’re going to work on a slip lead to teach her what we want her to do. Still can’t believe I got her to engage with me while another dog was just a couple feet away."
reactivedogs,fd43utb,t3_ejufb4,1578164164.0,First training session was this morning! Willow did so much better than I thought she would. Once she realized what her job was she caught on pretty quickly. We were able to bring another dog into the room while Willow worked with me on engagement and while she did freak out it just took moving her focus from the dog to me for us to be able to even get closer to the other dog. She also got to do a little agility as some fun time. These sessions will be good because us and handlers are learning how to get Willow to engage with us and ignore other dogs. Plus the trainer was impressed by her drive. We’re sold. Haha.
dogs,fd2xobd,t3_ejx1g0,1578152766.0,"Going to our first training session this morning. Willow is probably going to be super anxious the whole time while we learn. But since we aren’t feeding her breakfast she will definitely be hungry! She is super food motivated even for her kibble so I hope that helps her focus.

Edit: Willow was awesome and the trainer is great. He surprised us by saying we can move forward a little faster because Willow is so quick to learn what we wanted. We even had another dog in the room while I worked on engagement which was amazing."
dogs,fcz14x0,t1_fcxfrb9,1578091592.0,Ooh I’ve never tried laying the boxes. Going to try that next time I feed Willow this way.
reactivedogs,fcxya5q,t1_fcxwdyc,1578072117.0,Thanks! I was reading about it last night and saw that. We plan to wait at least a few weeks first. We got it more so for her isolation anxiety than her reactivity but obviously it’s a bonus if it helps her reactivity too! We don’t want to confound any thing the trainer teaches us either.
dogs,fcxvzsv,t1_fcxoj97,1578071318.0,Thanks! I’ll keep them in mind. We have 1:1s with a trainer Saturday mornings right now but hopefully in the near future! Willow is highly prey driven and nose driven so I think she’d excel at this.
dogs,fcxmosi,t3_ejfvso,1578066613.0,"Willow did so well at her vet visit yesterday. Less crying and just growled a bit at the techs. But once they gave her treats it was like it never happened. One tech said willow is now on her “she would steal” list because Willow is just that cute lol. Too bad we forgot to get the DHPP vaccine among all the others. 

Willow got a nice hike with her dad yesterday since he’s off till Monday. Today they will come meet me for lunch. My coworkers will want to see her again so hopefully she does ok with that."
dogs,fcxmfep,t1_fcxf01o,1578066440.0,Ooh where is the facility? I found one spot in Hayward last night but the barn hunt classes are Friday evening. We live on the peninsula so not driving across 92 after work.
reactivedogs,fcxm2ih,t3_ejcz25,1578066201.0,Had willows annual vet visit yesterday and got some trazodone. Going to wait to try it until we start with the trainer tomorrow but hoping it works. The vet was quick to suggest it when we said she had anxiety and a vet behaviorist isn’t convenient or close to us.
52weeksofcooking,fcv5zep,t1_fcuk2s3,1577995347.0,I learned souffles by hand and it was tough. So just getting something that tastes great is awesome!
dogs,fcui5e1,t3_eiynrb,1577981522.0,"Went for a sniffy walk yesterday which totally wore Willow out. We put her on the long lead and tested her recall off smells too. Unless she was neck deep in something she came! Not too shabby. 

My husband is off today so he’s taking her for a nice little hike and hopefully there aren’t too many people out. Then her annual vet appt this afternoon. Going to talk about anti anxiety meds and maybe get a prescription to have on hand for when we decide it’s time to start."
Cooking,fcrrxti,t3_eim4q6,1577905808.0,Made [this](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/237320/sherry-braised-beef-short-ribs/) last night (I just got one too!) and it was delicious.
dogs,fcr87p1,t3_eiipem,1577898210.0,"Willow was attacked yesterday on our afternoon walk. We were walking by a family maybe 20 feet away and their dog just rushed over barking like mad because they hadn’t been holding the leash. I stepped on it so Willow could move away so luckily nothing happened. I understand having a reactive dog (I was actually treating Willow as we walked by for not barking) but if your dog does that then you should always be looking out and holding the leash. Poor Willow had no idea what to do. 

In NYE news, a friend came over and Willow did her usual stranger danger barking but immediately stopped once we had the friend feed her. Then was cuddled up with our friend all night. Silly girl."
reactivedogs,fcphhas,t3_eieol8,1577864272.0,"Oof that’s rough. I’m sorry. If we still lived in our old apartment I’m sure we’d be hearing fireworks tonight. But our current city seems to mostly respect that fireworks are illegal. 

Granted we live right next to where the fireworks get set off for July 4th. Willow did okay then, she just hid under our bed and we turned up the AC fan to drown some of the noise."
AskWomen,fcovact,t1_fcon303,1577842536.0,Same. I can maybe get by every other day but since my hair is thin all grease shows. I’ve never had issues with heat damage and I blow dry 75% of the time/occasionally flat iron. I refuse to change lol.
dogs,fcnhaze,t3_ei3avf,1577811698.0,Willow has been nice and tired since bringing her home Sunday morning. But this morning she’s showing signs of her energy coming back. So going to have to get her to play later so she’s less annoying lol
dogs,fcnh6ak,t1_fcn9ezz,1577811620.0,"Willows goals would be liver and hot dogs lol. 

But our goals for her are to get a handle on her leash reactivity, be able to leave her alone (isolation anxiety) and to get her started in some kind of sport to build confidence and channel that terrier nuttiness into something productive haha."
dogs,fcn6jxy,t3_ei3g81,1577804587.0,"Willow came to us in February so she happily got rescued this year. Little did we know she has isolation anxiety and is leash reactive to other dogs (but is fine off leash). We tried cbd oil for one month and that helped her isolation anxiety but nothing else so asking the vet about meds Thursday. 

I hope we can get Willows general anxiety down and her confidence up. We start 1:1 training on Saturday and he thinks we can even get her CGC if we wanted. Willow is smart and I know she’ll do well once we build that confidence. And if I can just get an hour to go out to lunch with my husband that would be great because right now we have to stick her in daycare if we want free time. Daily daycare is basically our additional cost to eventually get a 2bd so she needs to cut it out lol"
dogs,fckgtqa,t3_ehmhat,1577725013.0,Willow probably thought it was the best day ever (except the bath) yesterday. Lots of cuddles and then she got to sleep with us in bed because we washed her bed and it wasn’t dry yet. This week we’re just taking it easy with her since she doesn’t have to go to daycare this week and we start our training sessions Saturday. Just going to do the vet Thursday for her annual.
TrollXChromosomes,fciaqtg,t1_fci6e1b,1577659848.0,"Her site is my favorite for baking and all the recipes I’ve tried worked well. I just jump straight to print view though.

Or king Arthur’s site! No extra fluff there."
dogs,fcgvyqa,t3_eh6aoh,1577644485.0,"Willow is home! She missed us and was wagging her tail a lot when we picked her up (she normally saves the crazy tail action for her favorite thing aka yak cheese lol). She just got a bath/ear cleaning/teeth brushing and it drying off with a good bully stick. Need to get her in for her yearly checkup this week as her bordetella is expiring. 

Forgot how cute she is. She’s tired so she’s going to have enforced nap time later."
Dogtraining,fc94vvs,t3_ego1s2,1577547073.0,Do you think he is losing his hearing? He may be nervous about noises sounding different.
dogs,fbzk01x,t1_fbw8rk5,1577249279.0,We’ve been toying with this idea since we adopted Willow almost a year ago. She’s very anxious but when she stays with our friend and her dog she does much better. But we know we would have to ensure the second dog is very confident and not just another problem child.
