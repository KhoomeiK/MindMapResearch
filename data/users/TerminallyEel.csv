China,fferbn6,t1_ffeqgop,1579861675.0,"N95, medical and surgical masks are prohibited from exporting for a month, except orders already taken and paid for before the 24th. Taiwan produces around 1.88 million masks a day, and consumes 1.3 million masks a day. This is to ensure that there will aboslutely be enough masks in Taiwan when the need arises, and also to assure the people so they don't all go out and stock up on masks, which would've created a false demand and caused an artificial shortage of masks where they're really needed.

Note that Taiwan already has a confirmed case and 70 more suspected cases (today), so there is aboslutely a need to take these precautions. Not to mention there's a real expected surge in demand for mask exports from China and Hong Kong."
taiwan,ffeqmp8,t1_ffeqhph,1579860655.0,"Also note that the law allows parents to renounce a child's citizenship before the child turns 15. After that, the laws regarding military service prohibit any change of the citizenship status until discharged. So there's a whole lot of complications when it comes to this."
taiwan,ffeqghe,t1_ffem401,1579860397.0,"Military service works off data from household registrations. If you were born in Taiwan and moved to the US at 3, then you most absolutely have a household registration, and most absolutely is a citizen, because otheriwise immigration officers would not have let your mother bring you through immigration control at the airport. Even babies less then two month old need a passport.

Same as the other reply, I recommend strongly that you check with the liason office about your status if you ever plan to visit Taiwan and don't want to leave it to chance."
taiwan,ffeqblp,t3_et5i6p,1579860191.0,"Shows how successful China has been at its propaganda campaign, even elite professionals just go ahead and classify Taiwan as part of China.

This is why the name is important, why bullshit like Chinese Taipei needs to go away, and why I believe we need to dump the ROC name completely sooner or later, because there exist no realistic future where the world would ever again think ""China = ROC""."
taiwan,ffepgrk,t3_et7icn,1579858886.0,"He needs to certify himself as an overseas national, please consult your local Taipei Liason Office. Without that certification, he will be banned from exiting Taiwan until he has served his term.

Overseas nationals are allowed occasional short visits for holidays and visiting family, but you must have your paperwork done properly.

Since he left Taiwan at 18, it is also important to know if he or his parents signed an affidavit regarding military service.

This is a very serious matter and I strongly recommend that you get current and official advice from the Taipei Liason Office."

worldnews,ffdptjg,t1_ffdn93d,1579826078.0,"I slap the ones who can't admit a mistake and insist on sarcastic remarks while pretending to be innocent.

I don't edit wikipedia, and no I'm not resorting to accusing you of anything. I'm pointing out that your comments show that you actually believed in that Chinese propaganda and are parroting it, even if just hidden behind those sarcastic remarks you no doubt thought were witty.

And if you didn't believe all that propaganda yet still choose to act the way you are acting now, then you're just adding to the problem."
MonsterHunterWorld,ffdp5ij,t1_ffdghaw,1579825656.0,"I understand Monster Hunter's ""Elder Dragons"" as a class of being that is above others. The elder dragons are to beasts what demi-gods are to men.

Kirin, in real world lore, is a descendant of the Yinglong, a winged dragon (""dragon"" in the Chinese traditional sense of the word, not the Lord of the Rings sense) who helped ancient Chinese leaders tame the rivers and rules over the Eastern Sea.

Also, Kirin in real lore is a very gentle being who don't even harm insects and flowers, let alone humans. The male is called Ki, while the female is called Rin.

In Chinese lore, Kirin is one of the Four Benevolent Animals who are said to bring good fortune to the nation. They are the Kirin, the Fenghuang (often mistranslated as the Phoenix, which is a different concept), the Turtle, and the Dragon (again, the regular Chinese dragon).

So, yeah, one needs to be able to leave behind the idea that dragons must have wings and tails and have a breathe attack; in Monster Hunter, a Japanese game, the ""elder dragon"" is just a name given to a class of beings with higher existence."
MonsterHunterWorld,ffdn3xv,t1_ffd4uzt,1579824405.0,"I mean any true hunter would have tried traps the first time they came up against elder dragons, even if just out of habit."
worldnews,ffdmum5,t1_ffdj39m,1579824248.0,"Sarcasm doesn't make you right, just in case you're not aware.

I don't have to run for government to know the nuances in what ""independence"" may refer to by different people. I live here, it's my country.

China likes to lump everything together because it's convenient for them to hitch a ride on the KMT bandwagon that has been vilifying the independence movement, because KMT supports the ROC which the independence movement wants to dissolve. It makes it appear as if China and KMT are in agreement, as a performance for the Chinese, and it turns ignorant people against the DPP, even though the DPP has shifted from a radical independence movement to a pragmatic status-quo party.

But you can go on parroting the Chinese propaganda if it makes you feel better."
worldnews,ffdi947,t1_ffdh02h,1579821430.0,"Because there *is* a group of people who want Taiwan to be independent from ROC. IOW, they want the ROC to be dissolved and a new nation of Taiwan to be founded.

You can skip the sarcasm because it just shows how ignorant you are about Taiwan."
todayilearned,ffdi1u3,t1_ffcwul1,1579821306.0,"I think, most if not all formal courses on Japanese will teach the courteous form and it'd be closer to business-Japanese, suitable for use in a professional environment.

The reason why people end up being told they sound weird is because they use it on friends and the Japanese drop into casual language for that.

For example the first person pronoun is ""watashi"", which is the standard and required form when you're doing a sales pitch, servicing a customer, etc. But when talking with friends and family, Japanese male usually use ""o-re"". If you use ""ore"" when talking to a customer, it is deemed rude as if you said to the customer, ""so what the fuck can I do for you today?""

That's why there are countless Japanese girls who would tell you that only girls use ""watashi""; it's because they're referring to the specific context right there only."
MonsterHunter,ffdgxpj,t1_ffdgf8g,1579820633.0,"Yes it is the same thing. I misunderstood you and thought you meant you could charge and then do the backstep. :x

Yeah I do the shield drop spam as well, I just need to actually make use of the backstep instead of spamming it and hoping for the best. Haha."
worldnews,ffdgkv2,t1_ffdg5l2,1579820421.0,"Taiwan doesn't have seats in international organizations because of politics, not because of lacking anything. And Taiwan has economic partners. In fact, the Taiwanese passport enjoys visa-free and visa-on-arrival at a lot more nations than China.

And what plug is there? You're still spreading the false image that Taiwan needs to do something to ""become"" independent. That's the Chinese propaganda. Taiwan is a sovereign nationi that China has successfully bullied the world into bullying.

What needs to be done is China getting its head out of its bottom. Or the world practise what they say about ""values""."
worldnews,ffdfyr7,t1_ffdbumo,1579820065.0,"Taiwan is by all measures a sovereign nation. The only reason people avoid talking about it is because China threatens to punish any nation, from the UK to the US and every nation in-between, if they dare recognize Taiwan.

Taiwan is already a sovereign and independent nation.

Taiwan is **NOT** a province of China that is trying to leave China. In fact, the government in Taiwan was actually founded in 1912, while China is founded in 1949.

Historically, *it was actually China that declared independence from Taiwan.*"
