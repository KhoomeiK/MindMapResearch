[https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200121-why-promoted-women-are-more-likely-to-divorce](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200121-why-promoted-women-are-more-likely-to-divorce)

To me, this means that it's still socially less acceptable for men to earn less or take primary care of the house/children. I think if we loosen that attitude, men and women both will be able to have more autonomy over their lives. - My point was really just to share the article but it's really hard to tack my opinion of its meaning on with it, sorry lol."
