If there's a likelihood that firey lives become endangered, often they'll make the call to retreat.

In Cali apparently this is... not quite the same. An example given was that you guys have smokejumper units (which we don't yet, government inaction) where you will fly a firey equipped and trained to jump out and land in hard to reach areas where spot fires are popping up risking greater spread of the fire. So their job is to jump out to somewhere completely remote and virtually unreachable on the ground, stop a fire from starting, and then have to evacuate on foot because the helicopter doesn't sit and wait around.

even people on his side of politics have been criticising him, influencers, personalities etc.

It all started with Kevin Rudd in '07. Progressive as fuck, loved by many. Hated in politics because he was hard headed and stubborn behind the scenes. IMO single handedly saved us from the GFC (no recession in 20+ years). Then he made a fatal mistake: tried to take on the coal industry. Wanted to implement a carbon tax. Murdoch media CRUCIFIED him for it. Absolutely nailed to a cross for all to see.

He got backstabbed by his own party as a result and Julia Gillard became PM some time around '10? Won the '11 election. Promised there would be no carbon tax. Tried to apply a carbon tax. CRUCIFIED.

She got backstabbed and replaced by... Who was it again? Something else must have happened because I don't remember a Labor leader after that.

**Edit**: OH YEAH LMAO, right before the next election, she got backstabbed by KEVIN RUDD FROM '07! But he didn't have a fantastic reputation anyway so he was never going to win. Unfortunately.

Tony Abbott wins the elections. Repeals regulation after regulation. Tangentially, just yesterday he was on an Israeli radio show talking about the rise of a religious-like group called the ""climate cult"". Total shitbag. Ate an onion raw. Gutted our National Broadband Network and basically wasted 50 billion dollars. Increased our reliance on coal. Ratings started going down and down and then CRUCIFIED.

He got backstabbed and replaced by Malcolm Turnbull. Oh Trumble, Malcolm Turncoat, he believes in climate change but made a deal with the devil. Also was the one who suggested and campaigned on gutting the NBN. I actually voted for him in the next election because, well, he's shit but he's economically sound. Big mistake, initiated robodebt collection calls for people on welfare causing suicides among poor communities, but hey it added $3 billion to the treasury yay. But oh his ratings are falling? Because Liberals called him Labor-lite and Labor called him Turncoat because he continued to fuck over the renewable industry. Hey wait! He's about to implement the National Energy Guarantee which is basically a dressed up carbon ta- CRUCIFIED.

He got backstabbed and there was an intense backroom Liberal party vote. Hitler-lite initiated the leadership spill and NEARLY WON but our current Scotto won just barely. Election time! Labor is winning the polls! Labor is campaigning on a huge set of amazing policies! Designed to benefit the poor, rebuild infrastructure, **increase firefighting capabilities and spending by $101 million**, but he wanted to close tax loopholes for just a few too many people on the top end of town.

No way is that okay in normal Australian politics, to trash talk your own side."
australia,fd2kfh0,t1_fd28ftn,1578148496.0,"I would say your comment is extremely conservative-bias but I don't disagree with what you've said. Maybe I disagree with the impacts of the things you've described like the timing and amount of disaster relief provided is pathetic, his mismanagement of the situation is almost criminal, but as for your summary I agree with the first two out of the three ""Do I"" statements. I think he has good intentions, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. And he's unintentionally evil by being such a climate change denying dickhead.

But yeah, I don't think he's done much for the bushfire relief, and whenever he does he needs to tout it like he's the bloody saviour."

I would go as far as to say the polar opposite is true.

There isn't a leader in this country that would be doing a ***worse*** job under the same circumstance."

This type of coal-loving rhetoric and mindset led to the PM trying to downplay and sweep this disaster under the rug, as if it's business as usual.

But yeah good list, I might copy and paste this to others."
australia,fd2iixp,t1_fd285ip,1578147741.0,"Maybe in Melbourne, they're pretty politically active down there.

Not in Sydney, sad to say. The 9-5 keeps us all chained down."

Bushfires.... Also yes. But we've never, ever, EVER blamed a pollie for their mis-handling of a bushfire before. Well, to this scale. Well, we may have, at a State level at least, I dunno. But I've never seen this much backlash against a PM for a bushfire."
australia,fd2i1kt,t1_fd2enot,1578147528.0,"I would look at the many other explanations around here, rather than listen to one small reason (which is a valid reason)."
australia,fd2hevo,t1_fd2edhj,1578147269.0,"He has been very hesitant to take any action or spend any money. Only today, 2 months after everyone realised this was a new level of catastrophic, did he announce military action, international help and monetary relief. Even with these measures, it feels like he's holding back. He should honestly be opening a 500 million dollar 'war' chest to deal with these fires and the recovery. There's no comfort, no reassurance and no messages of unity or leadership.

A NSW state minister of the PM's own party stated on national television that the PM ""probably deserved the welcome that he got. The people of this nation want you to open up the chequebook"", referring to the heckling he got at Cobargo, and his refusal to treat this as a seriously disastrous situation.

Oh and he brought in a lump of coal in the past into parliament while he and his conservative friends roared with laughter."

I'll never forget that."

This summer has been extremely dry.

We've been in a pretty bad drought for 2 years. Before the bushfires, the drought was the thing on everyone's mind. We were put on level 2 restrictions just a few weeks ago, which we haven't seen in over a decade (I think). Our dam (here in Sydney region anyway) is at 40%. I believe it's worse in other areas of NSW."
coolguides,fd27wgf,t1_fd23zef,1578143086.0,"Yep, spot on. They are letting the vast majority of these fires burn.

Right now it's basically impossible to fight these fires, only prevent more from popping up from embers.

We're waiting for rain before trying to tackle the bigger fires."

I would say if there's an active fire season, LISTEN to the authorities. If they say it's best to leave, just leave. If they say it's too late to leave, then it's TOO LATE to leave and the safest area is your home. Always have a place of ""last resort"" which should be communicated to you from the authorities. Clear the area around your house. I would love to help more but I live in Sydney so I don't have much training."
WTF,fd0frh7,t1_fd0b61j,1578118159.0,"Along with what the others have said, there's many dozen missing. Victoria alone has 28 currently missing.

What happens is people try to drive out when it's too late (long rural roads). The fire passes over them but since it's not a firetruck that's designed to withstand the heat, the people literally fry to death. It takes a while to confirm these deaths."
