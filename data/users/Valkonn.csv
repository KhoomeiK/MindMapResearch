tifu,fgl7qnw,t1_fgl7azy,1580884970.0,Ghosting is when you stop talking to someone. Curving is temporary or you can curve someone's romantic advances and still be friends.
oddlysatisfying,fgl4v1a,t1_fgl4jlk,1580882086.0,Cooking is full of French words. Not saying it applies in this case but there might not even be a commonly used English word for it.
AskReddit,fgk7w5w,t1_fgjf7b2,1580859393.0,"Because I feel uncomfortable and start talking more.

I’m honestly not doing it on purpose, I just don’t typically meet girls who will carry the conversation anywhere near as much as I will.

Maybe 2/5 girls I can talk with and never feel that uncomfortable silence when I’m done talking and it’s their turn."

SandersForPresident,fgj5ge7,t1_fgibg3e,1580837338.0,"Each candidate has precinct captains that report back the results as they’re finalized on-site.

Both Pete and Sanders did a better job of tabulating the results than the Iowa Democratic Party did. That’s how they know they won. 

I think Pete was winning early in the night but just barely. Now that he’s got all the data from his people I think he narrowly lost which is why he’s been backtracking in the media. Who knows, could still be a small surprise with how close it all is."

dataisbeautiful,fgf4tu6,t1_fgf454k,1580724484.0,"We use an orbital coordinate system called the celestial coordinate system. It is based around both the celestial plane (the plane on which the sun and earth lie) and the vernal equinox line which is the line you can trace from the sun, through the earth, and into the stars on the day of Vernal equinox. 

This creates a sphere with an origin from which we can measure longitude and latitude. In these coordinates it's called Right ascension and declination.

From there, you need to use coordinate transforms based on the time of year (because all the bodies involved move around). The longitude and latitude lines you drew shift around, but by referencing a chart you can see exactly how much they have moved and where."

I worked out in the fields for a while lifting heavy ass equipment all day in 100 degree heat. I wouldn’t wish that on anybody. I don’t give a damn if my coworkers start working a little slower, I get paid the same.

Never put in 100% for long. It’s unsustainable. 8 hours with no breaks is bullshit."
unpopularopinion,fgbka4e,t1_fgbitd8,1580662954.0,"You didn’t learn anything from my comment. 

You don’t google to “make your point stronger”.

You google to learn the truth. What if you look this subject up and it turns out your wrong? Are you willing to admit you’re wrong?

Try thinking more critically. Huge problem in modern discourse is people making sweeping statements and just assuming they’re correct."
unpopularopinion,fgbi7ji,t1_fgbhie3,1580662364.0,"What a bunch of bullshit this is, tbh.

I don’t doubt your point that men probably abuse women more.

Using anecdotal evidence to prove your point is worthless however. You need to do some actual research. When you start off with such a strong bias right off the bat, without actual research, you’re never going to be a critical person. Can’t let your bias control you so strongly.

In my personal experience, the split is actually fairly even. Lot of asshole dudes out there abusing their girl. However, lot of crazy bitches out there too. Women are just as controlling as men. Just recently lost 2 guy friends because their girlfriends don’t want them talking to other people."

I checked the subreddit and I couldn’t find the specific post Op is referring to if it even exists.

However, I found an even more stupid fucking post of users saying that toxic femininity stems completely from internalized patriarchy. Like, what?

That’s saying “all my problems are because men exist”. I would not be surprised if those people were sympathetic towards amber heard at the very least."

This is an advocacy project. It's just meant to get an idea in your head. Like I don't know, maybe plant an herb garden or 1 fruit tree. This guy isn't literally saying everybody should drop what they're doing and become farmers. He's not even doing this project anymore. It was just a temporary project for an environmentalist."
todayilearned,fg5aiu5,t1_fg5aaol,1580522431.0,A lot of people and publications refer to property tax as a type of [wealth tax.](https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/471313-americas-regressive-middle-class-wealth-tax)
todayilearned,fg5a4hi,t1_fg59sjt,1580522136.0,"We have a property tax and some states have an estate tax. Those are wealth taxes.

Regardless, my point wasn’t that we already have them but rather that this article pretends they don’t even exist. This article claims our tax system is highly progressive (LMAO) because income tax is already progressive for the lowest earners.

Obviously our tax system isn’t progressive. We can deduce that by looking at the results of said system and seeing massive wealth inequality and lack of access to basic needs like medical insurance. Lot of broke people in this country."
todayilearned,fg586cj,t1_fg56izf,1580520707.0,Income tax is not the only tax there is. What a bullshit article. It purposefully ignores the existence of wealth taxes and only looks at income taxes to say “See! The rich pay their fair share”.

dankmemes,fg3rpzq,t1_fg39uwv,1580488236.0,"90 percent of the effort to get abs is in the kitchen. Huge amount of people don’t even do core specific workouts, it’s just incorporated into other exercises. 

If you get your body fat % down to around 10% you will see abs even if you barely work out. 

The stomach is general where men put on fat first so it’s literally the last thing that you will see have definition unless you lose a ton of fat. People with six packs generally only have them for a short time because they’re starving/dehydrating themselves temporarily to get it."
dankmemes,fg3qzxz,t1_fg3q1th,1580487787.0,"No, the OP was correct. “Abs” don’t exist, you have a single abdominal muscle that is segmented into sections by fibrous bands going across your stomach.

When you have a “6-pack” it’s just your abdominal muscle bulging past those fibers. You don’t need to be very strong, everybody has at least a little bit of definition there because your core is necessary for walking and running.

If you’re skinny enough you will have a 6-pack or maybe even an 8-pack (it’s genetic). Just need to eat more protein so that you’re low in fat but retain the muscle."

Calling people who watch anime ephebophiles is like calling people who play video games psychopaths. Same sort of hysteria with no proven link.

I watch anime, I know many people who watch anime. Don’t know a single ephebophile. I can’t stand talking to people much younger than I am. (I’m 20)
