AskReddit,ffpoj1k,t1_ffm5lbv,1580100395.0,"Me too mate, I finished work about 1am and came to every channel showing it live. I saw the second plane hit in real time, wondering what the hell is going on over there. I was about 20. I'm sure the conspiracy theories were true, why would so much money disappear, and why was thermite found at ground zero? Why were the posts cut? Why was the building rated to withstand a plane impact? It really was designed to take a hit. Why did the building fall straight down like a controlled demolition? It should have fallen over like a Domino. I think the answer lies in corruption and people who have too much money like the 1 percenters. And Bush c'mon the man attacked his own country. Hope it never happens again"

I'm not sure about payment plans, probably should look into that. Atm I don't use it because it does nothing. When I was working it did nothing and I fell asleep 5 or 6 times on the way to work, more driving their trucks it was a nightmare I was so drained every day but the boss doesn't care.
