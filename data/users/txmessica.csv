If you text TRIAL to 21333, you get an automated phone call (after being prompted for your ZIP code) that transfers you right to your senator's office. Just think about what you are going to say before you text, because it happens fast. Could not be easier.  Please spend five minutes participating. Thank you!"

It's the only state garage in downtown Austin shaped like this (U shaped), so I'm almost positive they built it like this just to save these two trees, as unlikely as that seems."

Austin,fdhhr78,t1_fdh3yxr,1578422906.0,"I think the problem of hunger in the US is much more nuanced than this. A good percentage of the folks we are talking about are children. You can't expect them to be self-sufficient, and they shouldn't go hungry just because they are poor. Secondly, a lot of folks who are hungry are in transition and just need some help until they get back on their feet. Then there are those who are physically or mentally disabled. Are you asking them to fend for themselves?"
