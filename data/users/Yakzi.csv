facepalm,fewggar,t1_feweke6,1579410170.0,"Lets break it down.

‘Institutions’ don’t oppress people. What are institutions and policies? They are made individuals and executed by individuals. And the bias of these individuals of course affects these. There is no such thing as an individual without bias. I get your example of police shooting in LA, but do you think the police in Philly or Baltimore have never shot a black or latino? Unless of course you will say the police there are more rational and just than the LAPD.

No access to education is not different from specialized skill set. People go to school exactly to specialize in a specific skill set. Do you think there are more basketball courts than schools in black cities or neighborhoods?  Or less in white neighborhoods? It takes just as much dedication to learning as practice to be a doctor as it does to be LeBron. There are tendencies in cultures. Thats the difference. Are whites oppressed because Indians dominate IT in the US? 

Am not resisting anything. Its just illogical. It doesn’t add up. This glorification of self-victimization is not helping anyone and its driving communities apart."

I'd say power. But bear with me for a second.
Do you see any white president in Africa or the Middle East or East Asia? They do have white citizens, passport holders. In most cases these non-local whites face discrimination. 
If having a passport is not an issue there, then it shouldnt be here. 
If you are going to tell me that these blacks are descendant and have lived here their whole lives and contributed and all that, I completely agree with you.
But:
That means they are not slaves or descendants of slaves unless you will go on a diatribe about all blacks in America are descendants of slaves in which case I'll ask you about those that immigrated post slavery. 

And if the country is bad, blacks have contributed to that in which ever way. And if you say they are forced to contribute through tax/military/government, then so are other white people."

How about all the great black professors and leaders we have? Are they there cause of favors and not because they earned it? 

Are you saying that white people are short or not skilled at basketball?

I’d be surprised if you are implying any of the above cause you sound reasonable. Nothing is equal in this world. Bad things happens. There have been slaves in Africa and the Middle East long before they came to America. And when they came, they were sold to whites by their brethren.

Is slavery bad, yes. Is inequality/racism and such things bad, sure. But lets be honest and balanced about it."
