productivity,ffbwyg7,t3_esshat,1579785476.0,"I've started using a bullet journal, it's been helpful. I struggle with some executive dysfunction, so starting was a little hard, but r/bujo & r/bulletjournal have been very helpful in grabbing inspiration for structuring my journal!

My first month was pretty simple... Just had some chore tracking (dishes, laundry, trash, etc) & then created a space for daily to do lists. Next month I'm expanding to tracking habits (brush teeth, floss, cooking breakfast/lunch/dinner, taking meds, etc.) & having a page for project ideas with the possibility of expanding on said ideas with their own dedicated page. I'm also tracking monthly tasks like dusting, deep cleaning the kitchen, changing air filters, etc. I've set up a page to track how often I'm cross stitching... But haven't touched my cross stitch yet this year üòÖ the only downfall of a bullet journal is that you have to get into the habit of using it. I carry mine around with me, so that I have no excuse of not writing down something I've thought of that I need to do.

My therapist suggested having a basic notepad where I could write things down as they came to me, but I needed a bit more structure because I had no idea how long certain tasks/ideas had been sitting idle... I suffer from some amount of time blindness, so suddenly days turn into weeks turn into months & I still haven't worked on X... But how long has X been sitting there? No idea. LOL

When I was in school the most helpful thing for me was a dry erase board that was a calendar, I would plot out when assignments & tests were due. This was helpful for me when time was more critical because of deadlines, but I did not find it helpful for personal projects.

Hope you can find what you're looking for!!"

socialskills,ff67323,t1_ff6215c,1579620688.0,"Absolutely. Especially as an adult, not in college. One cool way to meet new people can be via dating sites, you just state upfront that you're just interested in making some new friends...find someone who has a solid group of friends & befriend them. This advise comes from the fact that one of my friends dated this one guy on OKcupid & he had a group of friends from college & then she introduced me to his friends & bam, suddenly I had like 10+ new friends...I wouldn't say I'm hyper close with any of them the way I was with my HS friends, but honestly a huge part of that is my own choosing. I do believe there are legit apps for meeting up with folks with similar interests though, that might be an easier route, less complicated lol. I think someone here had mentioned using one of those apps...

If you feel strongly about trying to maintain a relationship with any of your HS friends then try having some real heart to heart convos about boundaries & behaviors that bother you. The right ones will listen & shift with you. The ones who don't...aren't worth your time right now. That's not to say that you can't reconnect down the line when they've matured & grown (that's their journey to figure out)...but for now, you need to do what's good for YOU. Cuz no one else is gonna do that for you. Trust me, this is hard...but it's worth the work. üíñ"
LSD,ff5pha4,t1_ff5dose,1579604737.0,"Lol no worries.

I would agree that messing with any of the psychoactive drugs (weed, LSD, shrooms) can be a dicey game when you have a known history of hallucinations...is that what schizophrenia is? Forgive me, I'll admit to not fully understanding this, did not go to school for mental health & so my knowledge is based purely on things I've read off the internet, so will also admit that what I do know on these topics is limited... But, I have read that LSD can trigger psychosis to those who are prone to schizophrenia & has been shown to aggravate this condition specifically.

Also if you're taking any medication with lithium that is known to be bad to combo with LSD.

I won't tell you what to do, honestly that's entirely between you & yourself...I am simply here to share what knowledge I have. It's up to you to make the best choice for yourself.

Some tips if you do decide to try: start slowly, try half a tab wait 2 hours before deciding if you want the second half... You really never know the strength of your tab until you've tested it yourself (IMO). Setting is another factor in a trip, don't try to go out in public (going on a short nature walk can be fun, but only if you're familiar with the area & have a trip sitter)... But for a first trip, staying in a familiar place is ideal. Having some activities can be helpful to dealing with some of the anxiety that you might could experience...I enjoy having some music & getting up & dancing to get some of the body jitters out, moving feels so good. Picking some familiar show or movie to watch, especially after the peak helps pass time & ease you back into reality. I enjoy having the option to get creative, so I have a coloring kit with gel pens & coloring books...I know people who enjoy drawing or painting, I'm just not that talented lol. Don't go in expecting to do something in particular or having an expectation of doing a particular activity, just having the options to dance, color, draw, play games, etc. is enough. Like playing video games or watching something can be an excellent trip activity for some while others just enjoy dancing & others want to get creative in some artistic way... Just depends on what you enjoy.

Whatever you choose, be safe & have fun! Reach out if you have anymore questions üíñ‚úåüèª"

This only works if you have a consistent work schedule. On Sundays, when I don't go to work til 5pm, I'm allowed to take a nap before work...or if I am sick I'm allowed to sleep extra...but otherwise, I have to get up. I chug my coffee, take my meds, & some days I just sit & watch TV all day or read a book, but I'm up.

I screamed & demanded a pen & paper so I could write it down & not forget it, but every time I tried to use the pen I could only make scribbles...the words to describe what I saw lost to me... It took me a full year before I finally remembered...that was probably one of the more acid heavy years because I kept trying to get back & remember...

Ultimately I think that some meditation would have been better & I might have arrived at the answer sooner...but I had been using acid to distract myself from my reality, which I was heavily unhappy in...spent a lot of that year in these constant loops...every time I would trip I remember just staring at myself in the mirror wondering what I was doing, searching for the answers amidst the partying & chaos, when I probably needed peace & quiet to find the answers.

I did find them, but...it was a really hard year. I hope you are able to remember üíñ‚úåüèª"
LSD,fed7kwy,t1_febxk2x,1579002575.0,"Can't help but agree, when you're dosing that often you lose the magic of it & it no longer feels as special. No reason to be taking that much, especially so often.

But also, you do you...stay safe üíñ‚úåüèª"
LSD,fed73wp,t3_eog6lq,1579002005.0,"I mean, I was 20 the first time I tripped & it was on shrooms. 21 for acid. There is a reason the drinking age is 21 & that is because your brain is still developing...granted I drank & got drunk for the first time when I was 18.

I'm sure that most folks turn out fine, but when you are under 18 you're running into a fair amount of risks unless your parents are super absent or you've got a friend who has the house to themselves for a weekend, etc. Setting is a big factor in an enjoyable trip experience, I would usually suggest doing it for the first time in the comfort of your own home or a trusted friends home.

If you can wait until you're at least 18, I think you'll be better off for it overall, but I have no science or research to back that up.. just experience & opinion. Safe travels when you do go üíñ‚úåüèª"
LSD,febmthr,t1_febldms,1578960531.0,"Agree with this analogy. I find the experience begins to dull if done too frequently. Personal experience opinion...been tripping for about a decade & probably have tripped at least 50 times in that time frame...some years I'd take it every month, some every other week for periods, & some I'd only go a handful over the course of the year...my most recent break has been about 6 mo & I am jazzed to go on my next one at the end of Feb since it'll have been so long ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
ADHD,febm58a,t3_eocg3k,1578960260.0,"Yay!!! What do you think of the medication? I heard it's pretty new. How long have you been taking it? Idk if I can ask my doc to change my medication right now, as I just asked for a change at my last visit, but I am curious about Jornay, only heard of it like a month ago, right after my psych apt, of course."
LSD,febllqq,t3_eobpez,1578960046.0,"I'd definitely say if you want to experience a more intense time you gotta play the delayed gratification game. Molly should be spaced out at least 3-4 months or you need to eat more...but that is kind of like playing with fire. Much more fun if you can just be patient. I've heard some folks say don't candy flip more than once or twice a year...I've definitely done it mutliple times within a year, so my experience is that when I didn't give myself the 3-4 month break from the Molly, it was less intense. When I was able to wait, the experience was much more satisfying, swimming in the carpet kind of experience. I think you got the overall timing down, 2 hours in you take the Molly cuz you're supposed to peak on both to create this 3rd experience of the combo. Also, yea, drinking & acid has always been a bad combo for me & my friends. So probably right there. Lol, well there's a scattered brained response to your Qs üòÇ best of luck! üíñ‚úåüèª"
LSD,febjswp,t3_eob7q4,1578959576.0,"I took shrooms my first time diving into the world of psychedelics. But if you're gonna do acid at the music festival then do acid at home first.

I find shrooms to lend itself to more nature vibes, going to a walk, or even just in your backyard & rolling around in the grass (that's totally what I did on my first shrooms experience lol) only to remember that you're allergic to the grass & laugh at yourself being very itchy & slightly burnt cuz your a pale pale human who went out in the sun without sunscreen cuz who thinks about that when they're tripping for the first time üòÇ

There are lots of good resources on this sub if you look around. One of the more important things is to remember to hydrate. Hydrate. Hydrate. Hydrate. Especially when you're at the festival, oh god please, have a camel back, it makes life while tripping at a festival so much more fun. üíñ‚úåüèª"

That's what my bf said, that it probably won't have any real consequences, but my anxiety tells me otherwise üòÖ but it is just a game...but a game I've poured some amount of time & $ into lololol I'd hate to get sent to jail or expelled just cuz I was staying true to my character...& I related to Talbott's choice & was like, other characters have done it & been fine (mostly lol)"
LSD,fe8fjbx,t1_fe88mfo,1578925615.0,"Make sure you give yourself a solid 2 weeks before trying again. & if you aren't feeling anything around the 2 hour mark, you can always take another half tab / tab. My only warning with this is that since you've never tripped before you might not recognize the come up feels & end up tripping wicked harder than you meant to. If you're more of a go with the flow personality type, in a good headspace, comfy environment, with a trusted friend/trip buddy who hopefully has more experience, then it should be manageable. Staggering like this also can result in things not coming on all at once, so even though you might end up taking 2 tabs overall the peak wont be as intense as if you had taken 2 tabs initially. If that makes sense. I also don't advise going from 1 tab trip to taking 2 tabs on the next one. Ease up to it, if you did 1 this time, try 1.5 next time, then eat the other half after 2 hours if you're not starting to feel anything. After that point, I don't advise taking more. Wait til your next trip & then you can try starting with 2 initially. It's worth it to be patient & a little scientific with finding what dosage works best for you. & again, you've always got the dice roll of uneven sheets...there finally came a point for me that I just accepted whatever intensity trip I had & not go back for more."

LSD,fe88fqq,t3_eo3rdz,1578923686.0,I've heard of sheets getting dried unevenly...so while one friend got a heavy dose on 1 tab another got nada...sadly I have only recently learned about test kits (after tripping for a decade lololol) so have had my fair share of this experience.. sorry that happened though. Always a bummer.
depression,fe86bu7,t3_eo3s8o,1578923032.0,"Spent most of my 20s single.. I know it sucks to keep making yourself vulnerable & then squished but try not to lock up. Keep trying, keep going out, the reward is worth the risk. Also, learn to enjoy being with yourself...being able to spend time alone is hella important.

Allow yourself to feel, don't bury it. Journalling is one of the best ways to process things in a more objective manner & is very cathartic, similar to crying. Process your feels as much as you can & try to release it.

I hope that you can heal & move forward, *they* are the ones who are not worthy of *you* üíñ‚úåüèª"
LSD,fe84rox,t3_eo3so8,1578922559.0,I would agree that if you would like it to be a positive experience that being in a positive mindset helps. Gotta also have a commitment to fun üòâ
LSD,fe813rs,t3_eo3tzb,1578921202.0,"I personally did shrooms as my first step into the psychedelic drug world.

LSD first should totally be fine, just stick to starting with a low dose (no more than 1 tab, which should be 100-150ug). Make sure you're in a comfortable setting, have gotten plenty of sleep, & don't forget to drink water during.

Having some pretty video games, movies, & music set up will always help also. Safe travels! üíñ‚úåüèª"

depression,fe2m2td,t3_ennx7d,1578840340.0,I feel this. My bf says I need to get on some kind of medication. Eh. I think that the way society has been shaped is more the cause of these feelings.

They/them being the one percent...but let's not get too far down that rabbit hole...
