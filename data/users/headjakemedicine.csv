todayilearned,fcgfsof,t1_fcfj2n4,1577639503.0,ok lol
todayilearned,fcgfkn8,t1_fcge8ph,1577639410.0,"I don't know man, when you see little old ladies freaking out about how ""canchito"" a little baby is, or ""que bonitos los ojitos claros"" time and time again and then hear the same people talking about how their neighbor's kids have the ""marca mongolica"" like it's some kind of disease, and then the same people talk about the kid who works in the corner store and call him and Indio, it starts to looks more like racism than a ""city vs. hillbilly"" thing"
todayilearned,fcge5us,t1_fcf0lrx,1577639053.0,"Absolutely, the Mayan population a lot of times work menial jobs in little stores, or making tortillas, or even (like in Roma) as personal servants."
todayilearned,fcgdws1,t1_fcfjziu,1577638963.0,"Exactly, which makes the racism even harder to fathom because of the fact that they all carry that same bloodline, just some more than others, and then they tout that as some kind of superiority complex. Really sad to see."
todayilearned,fcgddse,t1_fcd9bqb,1577638871.0,"I was in the capital for like 16 months, mostly zona 6 and zona 18, but I got to know most of the city. Then I was in a rural part of zacapa for about 8 months."
todayilearned,fcgcwlz,t1_fceb6bq,1577638738.0,"Yeah it's pretty heavy. And just hearing people be soooo stoked that a baby came out a little lighter skinned or had green eyes like they had more inherent value than a darker skinned, brown eyed baby was really kind of disheartening."
todayilearned,fcgca75,t1_fcfph8t,1577638546.0,"You're absolutely right, and kudos to your dad for being a good hardworking dude. More what I meant is that there are a lot of Guatemalans that celebrate the fact that they are less indigenous than others, and even look down on those that are darker skinned/more indigenous than themselves. There is a whole stigma around having the ""marca mongolica"" if you care to look that up. Really interesting and sad considering that all guatemalans have at least some indigenous blood, but they regard those with more of it so poorly so much of the time."
todayilearned,fcdea7s,t1_fcdc4am,1577609211.0,Yup
todayilearned,fcd1o8o,t3_eh15i5,1577605256.0,And unfortunately they are discriminated against pretty heavily by the more European blooded Guatemalans. I lived there for 2 years and the racism between those populations can be pretty shocking at times
