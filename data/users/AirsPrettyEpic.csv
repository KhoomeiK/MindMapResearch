Our other was a white created polish and he was the sweetest thing. Maybe it was just his personality, or maybe it was because we babied him from the very beginning. Roosters never fail to confuse me"

BackYardChickens,fehzye4,t1_fehvklm,1579127300.0,"You get a small to medium  egg every other day. If you want lots of eggs, they’re not the way to go. However when we only had 6 polish and nothing else it kept my family of 4 with more than enough eggs. Personally I recommend polish for personality’s. We treat our birds like pets, and the polish are always my favorite. They follow me around like dogs wanting snacks, and they all have such distinctive personalities. (All my chickens do actually) I can also cuddle them with minor complaints."
