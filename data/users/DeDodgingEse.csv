pics,ff0jayh,t1_ff0e8pj,1579469425.0,"It's all alleged. Show me the texts. What I've read is that the mother is suing Carrey over a note discovered in the daughters iPad that he introduced her to cocaine, prostitutes, and disease. However all of this was never proven and the case was settled out of court which Carrey regrets settling by the way. 

Also her STD exam before meeting Carrey was faked clean so she may have had diseases before being with him. 

Since Carrey feels strongly about his case he opened up a counter sue to the mom and her estranged husband. Why would he open up a counter if he wasn't sure he had sufficient evidence to prove his innocence? 

Sorry but I think the story is deeper then what the media is telling us. Maybe because of all these allegations and false claims against him he became a depersonalized painter."

YouTube is pretty much the same thing. Don't really know what else to say about my searching skills. 

There was definitely a love interest in the music video too if that helps. Like a guy followed her through the blanket fort at one point and transported to this beach scene.
