splatoon,ffb36tj,t1_ffb2rai,1579750622.0,Wow those really are boring.
bulletjournal,ff3gcnc,t1_ff3g82s,1579540472.0,"Thank you! I messed up part of a page and I'm considering covering it with black and then using white lettering, so that would be perfect."
bulletjournal,ff3g5ga,t3_eqypat,1579540362.0,Is the black painted on? What white pen do you use on it?
NintendoSwitchDeals,feptp5v,t1_fedrqmh,1579330930.0,"Funny, you got downvoted for this but now this exact point is being discussed. Even though the OP of that post admitted he was making assumptions, I still think both of you are right to wonder about the implications."
NintendoSwitchDeals,fedw4ig,t1_fedvtrp,1579021139.0,"I was writing my comment while his was posted, but my comment wasn't talking about economies at all. If he knows what he's doing that's absolutely fine. I'm just saying that a lot of people change regions without knowing the consequences."
bulletjournal,fedugu7,t3_eom21t,1579020145.0,"It's really interesting with that small amount of sleep you aren't tired more often, and even productive a couple days."
NintendoSwitchDeals,fedte2b,t1_fedrqmh,1579019488.0,"It concerns me that most people who do it don't seem to fully understand the consequences. During the Qubic Christmas sale there was a lot of confusion from people who had already purchased the games, but had done so by switching regions and therefore weren't able to participate in the chain. This sub was flooded with questions about changing regions that most people didn't have answers to. 

I do think also that at some point Nintendo is going to start cracking down on excessive region changes. Just because the Switch isn't region-locked doesn't mean that switching up your region constantly isn't discouraged and suspicious."
CasualConversation,fd8a7l8,t3_ek3ygk,1578215800.0,"Something that I have inherited from my mom is my ability to cry extremely easily. It used to be a point of great frustration for me, and I still do struggle to accept that I will cry easily if I'm upset/angry, and that people will perceive me as weak because of this.

But I will also cry if something makes me happy, like my mom. I love that my mom will see something seemingly simple and tear up because it makes her happy, and I love that I'm the same way. My last partner found it adorable and loved to list things that had made me cry out of joy."
AbductedInPlainSight,fcwwgou,t1_f5pmr1q,1578040532.0,"Hey, I know this is an old thread but I just stumbled upon it and I have to say thank you for sharing your experiences. You clearly are a very mature and emotionally intelligent person because the way you politely yet concisely express how you disagree with the original commenter is so admirable. I hope life is treating you well!"
bulletjournal,fc4vc5a,t3_eg5erv,1577429897.0,What kind of notebook is this? It's gorgeous!
Tinder,fbne1j7,t3_ebl5yq,1576996314.0,"Not a story time but there really needs to be an r/tindercirclejerk.

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tinder/comments/educni/i_didnt_think_this_would_actually_work/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) was the last straw for me in terms of cringiness. This sub is full of posts like this of men using dumb pickup lines, women joking back, and then the comments exploding with congratulations on the totally confirmed sex.

The story time and profile review threads are fine from what I've seen, but the usual posts are hot garbage.

Edit: So there *is* a r/tindercirclejerk that didn't show up in my initial search! But it's not active."
