Jokes aside, a lot of what we know about NK is 1) propaganda from inside NK and 2) propaganda from the US. Having read Talking to North Korea by Glyn Ford you can see in the middle of those two images is a country that has a deeply repressed, unhappy population, and a ruling body struggling to survive. I think you could view Romulus' star going supernova as analogous to NK's famines in the 90s, with a heavy industries economy in freefall failing to be able to deal with something you'd assume they could.

If you want to being Nemesis into play, Romulus was able to be taken over with a swift coup, liquidating the Senate, which isn't dissimilar to what the hyper-centralised NK fear for their politburo, which is why there's a regular turnover of members, to protect the position of Un. 

It wouldn't surprise me whatsoever if Romulan isolationism was fuelled by their empire's rapid decay after their prolonged wars and it's in part a defence that hides the weakness openness would show.

I also think Unification (1991) was inspired by the revolutions in the Eastern Bloc, with Spock playing the sort of figure that smuggled material into Poland/Hungary/Baltics/East Germany/et al. So the idea of Romulus being Vulcans behind an Iron Curtain that can be reached isn't too far off."
DaystromInstitute,fft6ufs,t3_ev0w58,1580210106.0,"One comparison I think you might find interesting is North Korea.

For one, that they are the unknowable uncanny, given that they are a split from the race we know the best, the Vulcans. Similarly we have an unknowable North Korea that is a post-war line in the sand, with us knowing South Korea well.

Then there's a Neutral Zone, transgression of which fixates the Romulans who aim to push the Federation into doing so to get what they want out of them. The North plays a similar game with the South regarding the DMZ.

Romulans pursue banned technology and use it as leaverage when interacting with the Federation. North Korea pursuing nuclear power and weapons comes to mind...

They are seen as inscrutable and elusive on the diplomatic stage. 

They are presented as an intergalactic antagonist, and perhaps that suits the Quadrant as it allows others to rally around that threat, it is a great binding force for the Federation and Klingons. And then we have NK dominating world news at times, indeed being what keeps the US bound to SK and Japan.

But ultimately, North Korea is a paper tiger, if that. It has its extreme militarism because without that show it would quite evidently be economically, ideologically, perhaps even civilisation-wise, bust. It pursues nukes because it would lose any conventional war. It avoids diplomacy because it has nothing to pursue as an equal partner. Its people are unhappy and do not believe in the project despite what slogans they shout. Without the subterfuge, by any cynical party, they would be eaten alive.

So if we follow the comparison, where does that leave the Romulans? Perhaps like the NKs they prod the Neutral Zone because it is the only way to remind the Federation they exist - accomplishments haven't. And while they may have technology that makes them feared, at what cost? How do Romulans live? We already have Spock visiting to try and aid reunification, what if the Romulan people want that but are kept chained to Romulan state militancy? 

Equally, what if the Federation knew Romulans were a paper tiger but like the US presented them as a bigger threat because it enabled an alliance with a real threat like the Klingons? If Spock can get in to Romulus surely Vulcan intelligence has been probing them too.

I think perhaps the Romulans as you say weren't quite the big thing they were made out to be. And perhaps that was an act on their part, but perhaps it was an act on the Federation's part, too. Romulus isn't a Cold War era Soviet Union, it's a post Cold War North Korea. An out of date faction that finds itself out in the cold, who presents itself as a dragon to stop itself being dismantled in the new order. And to bind that new order together, the Federation plays along with the lie."

redscarepod,ffrevs9,t1_ffr9ig7,1580156678.0,"> Naomi Campbell 

Okay maybe I shouldn't have said 'white features' but Naomi got her start as the baby of the Buffalo set and Buffalo was all about racial ambiguity with Ray Petri picking models of all races who you wouldn't necessarily peg as one race, either because they were mixed or because of an unusual look. Campbell slotted into that niche because she had something that differentiated her from other Black women and it was Chinese roots. When Campbell was picked by Petri and in The Face or wherever else in those early days it was, yes, because she was 'black - but with something else', just like Neneh Cherry did. So no it's not white - mea culpa on that - but surely you get my point that Iman and Campbell were the first big Black supermodels and they were both 'black but not you know, *black* black'.

>men (white/black) find the overall attractiveness of a celebrity woman based on what they are TOLD

If this holds true, who are some dark skin Black women marketed at white men? The only Black women celebs I can think of white men even acknowledge are light skinned. I mean... there's clearly a sense black isn't beautiful in white society and yeah that bleeds out into sexual attractiveness. Some individual men may date Black women moreso if in big cities but like... you must notice it's a bit of an outlier, no?

>Moreover, I honestly believe that your worldview is very much Americanized. 

I'm British lol. I grew up in London and my school was like 80% non-white. And I have friends who are dating white men and are very happy. I also have friends who don't like black men (whole other topic) and feel totally overlooked by white men. I mentioned hijabi friends to make clear it's not necessarily hate or bigotry but perhaps an assumption of dislike on the woman's part. I also have friends who as said have dated white men, whose exes were all black, and when they break up, dates another black girl half his age etc. And this is all within the context of one of the most cosmopolitan cities on earth, let alone the rest of the country where, you know, the vast majority of white men actually are.

>Any black woman who has lived in Europe (like me) will tell you that there are lots of white men who date a broad array of races.

There certainly is, just like I imagine there are in New York, L.A., Chicago, or whatever big American city. When you drift out of Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, you'll find the same attitudes you'd find in America.

My initial comment I stand by. OP framed finding Lizzo attractive around her weight. I think pointed out some objectively beautiful Black women white men barely clock. No white man is out here saying *you know what, if that Lizzo just lost some weight...* lol. Because it goes a little deeper than that. There's enough data on dating site preferences or even things like how Black women fare on dating shows that prove that. And it goes without saying I'm not saying it like I agree with it (disparaging Black beauty, that is), there's Black women significantly more attractive than white peers who are overlooked by white men, like it comes down to more than figure, surely. Even if that is changing in cities and campuses those two together are still the minority of white men.

btw while I doubt you care I didn't downvote your comment."
redscarepod,ffr8038,t1_ffr3kv1,1580152446.0,">Naomi Campbell does NOT have white features at all

Yeah but... Nor do Ethiopian/Eritrean/Somali women. Those are Ethiopian/Eritrean/Somali features. But Europeans saw them and ghettoised them from 'ugly blackness' into 'white dipped in chocolate'.

Features are features, and some are racialised into being 'white' or 'black' despite both groups having them.

Also you can't say my assessment is wrong when you've misread it lol. The women I listed weren't listed because they are 'the Black women white men like the most' it was a list of objectively very attractive Black women in the media that men would just default think are hot yet white men think it less than they should. White men will worship a meh famous white woman and overlook a stunning famous black woman. There's enough cases of that with celebs that it should be self evident.

I've known white men who actively discount black women as partners and on the flip side close friends who are black women, when they've dated white men it's been white men who consistently date black women. To suggest there's no barrier in attractiveness with white men vis a vis race it's just skinnyness is absurd."
