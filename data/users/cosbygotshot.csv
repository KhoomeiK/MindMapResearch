My analogy isn't faulty im not doubting the critical nature of the virus. MY POINT BEING THAT THIS IS GETTING BLOWN WAY OUT OF PROPORTION. . MORON.I dont   even know what a false flag is indulge me sit. And yes u probably am dumb as shit but not as fucking  stupid judgemental and blinkered as you.  I  love flags. What's the most common color I  national flags . It's in a massive % of them. It's not a real threat. It's just another thing. Thus thing  I is the latest thing they feed to  u. It wont even be news in 2 weeks. I never initiated any insults towards another person.(initiated) merely gave a point of view. A d fuck me why cant you typed deal with that. 
You know what I won't give you the numbers you can look them up yourself . The mortality rate for the common influenza virus. In terms of total dead people which is the bott8m  line.  Only stat rhat matters is magnitudes higher than this fuck ing virus.  I can't tell you how to think bro.  But you really need to get a life.

The one you see sold in all the supermarkets and  such. Your short & long rasher style. Is the loin. My point being though an you torally missed  it because maybe your head was stuck up your arse. If it was just human error on your behalf I apologise. But my point was  pork belly and bacon are not the same thing. Google gives you  answers according to what info you typed and read in ypur history. But yeah. Is pouring cream in a bowl the same ad ice cream just not ice creamified. Are livers in a bowl the same as pate or parfait just not parfaitIfied. Are grapes in a glass the same as wine just not wineries.

a 2007 analysis of medical journals from the period of the pandemic[16][17] found that the viral infection was no more aggressive than previous influenza strains. Instead, malnourishment, overcrowded medical camps and hospitals, and poor hygiene promoted bacterial superinfection. This superinfection killed most of the victims, typically after a somewhat prolonged death bed.[18][19]
