The foremost reason why a living person isn't decomposing right now is because of the immune system.

The fact that for some people, the immune system has nasty side effects, is in the end a minor drawback compared to the benefits."

The tragedy of modern life is that we interact so much with what are basically strangers. We're not build for that.

If anything, it's a minor miracle that there is so (relatively) little violence between people."

Het komt soms voor dat een thesis afgewezen wordt met min of meer ""je moet nog wat meer doen"".

Maar dat is *voor* de goedkeuring. Zodra een opponent hun goedkeuring heeft gegeven, is dat practisch gezien finaal."

Futurology,fduz0t4,t3_emqzhr,1578741155.0,"The idiocy with this tax is 

* 1) defining 'robot' will be very difficult and will be very open to loopholes 

* 2) basically is a tax on innovation. Congratulations, you now have many jobs plus an economy that will fall more and more behind other countries.

The thing is, politicians, business owners and other people don't want to deal with things like unemployement benefits or universal basic income. So let's introduce a tax that sounds nice but in practice will never work and will see widespread evasion."

2) Iedereen wilt de grote jongens binnen de V.N. houden, anders stelt de V.N helemaal niks voor. De League of Nations faalde compleet omdat zoveel grootmachten eruit wegliepen. 

3) De V.N. heeft primair twee taken: WW3 voorkomen en communicatie tussen landen verbeteren. Het helpt deze taken niks door China eruit gooien."
