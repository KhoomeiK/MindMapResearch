Giant isopods resemble the terrestrial wood louse, but much much bigger. Also there's video of one biting off the face of a dogfish. Speaking of isopods, there's another called the tongue eating louse, which, as the name implies, parasitically chews off a fish's tongue and then attaches itself instead, essentially becoming the tongue. Not deep sea per se, but still horrifying."

Thursday 1/16 at 7:30 is the Ampersand Theater Stress Test, their first show in their new space at 628 N. 10th Street. Several longform improv house teams will be performing. (This is a rescheduled show from last Saturday, which was cancelled due to the snowstorm that never showed up.)

Friday 1/17 at 7:30 is the Ampersand Grand Opening show- same general idea (longform improv), same location, but different groups performing this time. Tickets for both shows can be purchased at [ampersandtheater.com](http://ampersandtheater.com) or at the door! 

And Saturday 1/18 at 7pm is Sketch 22, a 22-hour sketch festival. 10 teams of writers, 10 directors, forty actors, and three musicians spend 22 hours (starting Friday night) writing an original comedy sketch (or song) and perform them all the next night. The show is at Comedysportz Milwaukee, 420 S. 1st St. Tickets are $10 at the door. 

Come out and support local comedy!"
