Not all people have caring friends, instead they are surrounded by hipocrital idiots ( i think there is nothing wrong with being a little hipocrital if you don't notice it, the thing is if you are aware of it, and don't care about being a asshole, and you think you are right everytime without admiting how hipocrital you are , you are real trash ) , who treat you like shit till you barely want to live, or in other cases you are straight alone without nobody to notice and help, even your family, because you try to get their help but instead they say ""ohhh the little kid got a little kid problem so it doesn't matter"" 

Why bother to live if you feel miserable everytime you wake up?
is wrong to put a definitive end to these negative thoughts? If nobody cares about you why would they care when you are dead? Or it will be to mantain appearance and be labeled as normal people? 

They say that you were a good individual if you die, they will start to ""remember"" false good moments with you, when in reality they treated you with disdain and false appreciation

So why???

Darksiders,fdfreki,t3_ekz77j,1578368366.0,"The spots i remember are: sentinel gaze (kingdom of the dead) , death tombs ; equip demonheart talisman for better drops.
Break the barracks, you can save before breaking them, and reload your save till you have the dessired possessed weapon, both in stats and design
If you want a really good scythe ( or secondary ) take the possessed weapons without stats, so u can build them from 0, be sure to make ""generations"" of possesed weapons with only one broken stats, with this you can make a possessed with some really high stats, start saving weapons from new game, and carry them without make the definitive possessed weapon

In new game plus u can reach the max level. The values for scythes are between 245-290 if fully maxed ( i think) 

For better control buy the lvl 40 talisman from vulgrim, these talisman are not equipable, and don't have stats, they are just for leveleling possesed, so you feed a desided high stat ( example: critical damage 42% ) and you just feed the remaining exp for the weapon with those talisman

Another tip is if you want some of the most desired stat ( life and wrath steal ) is better feeding statless talismans to a statless possessed than farming for the mentioned stats ( the talismans can give random stats, but never will interfere with a stat you intended to put with a item, example is if you feed a critical chance item to a possesed weapon and fill the remaining exp to level said possessed with vulgrim talismans you will still have critical chance, but there is a possibility that in the stat pick up per level one of the upgrades  can be life steal, wrath steal, frost damage , executiom chance, etc )"
