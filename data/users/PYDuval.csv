Insulin Resistance, Diabetes...  


  


Know any of those? Eating often is far from a good idea. Small portions or not - all the ""mainstream nutrition"" knowledge is bullshit and made to sell more stuff - not to make people healthy.   


&#x200B;

Intermittent fasting - be it in a restrained window of eating, one meal a day or even prolonged fasting - have proven health benefits, unlike nutrition 'science' that have many claims and the only 'science' behind it is epidemiological studies which are cherry-picked data from very poor sources (usually very biased surveys like ""how many times a week do you eat red meat"" to correlate it with cancer when its sugar that's responsible, or smoking, etc.); aka complete crap science is what nutritionist have to back them.  


&#x200B;

So how could eating all the time (some nutritionist suggest a small meal every 3 hours) be healthy when your body needs time to process it all? Spiking your insulin constantly throughout the day is a very very bad idea."
