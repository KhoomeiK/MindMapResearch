AskReddit,fe8zm3t,t3_enwojq,1578932622.0,It wasn't free but for a few dollars I just became a Dr. of Metaphysics through the Universal Life Church and the documents to prove it.  I can now legally marry people as well as all of the other legal rights and privileges awarded to ordained ministers.  I'm going to thoroughly enjoy using my new title of Dr. on documents!  :-)

AskReddit,fe56c5k,t1_fe54t69,1578866034.0,What if they asked to speak with their lawyer in person before answering any questions and definately before consenting to the breathalyzer?  Odds are it being late at night and the lawyer is sleeping and won't be there for a while.  Could that buy even more time on top of them having to get a warrant?
AskReddit,fe54dos,t3_eng8y5,1578865519.0,Take your time with foreplay.  If you don't think you last long during intercourse and want to extend the time pull out and tightly grasp the base of your penis before you get to the point of no return before your orgasm.  This will stop you from finishing too soon and allow you to keep going multiple times before you decide that you want to have your orgasm.

AskReddit,fe50dlf,t1_fe1plze,1578864524.0,I've heard (I don't know if it's accurate or not as it doesn't really apply to me) but there isn't a law that requires a person to submit to a field sobriety test.  They can make take one at the county jail though.  If anyone can prove this wrong I'd like to know about it as I'm not an attorney.
AskReddit,fe4zvxn,t1_fe1pvgk,1578864353.0,"This might be dependant on the jurisdiction but audio recordings, at least where I live, must have all parties consent.  So you can legally record video almost everywhere but not audio."

AskReddit,fe4x84r,t3_ennslu,1578863650.0,Eat healthy and exercise.  Good health is true wealth.  I'm sure you've heard of the two rules for success in life: 1) be attractive 2) don't be unattractive  Being healthy will be difficult in the short term but it will yield fantastic results in the long term.
AskReddit,fe4wwy5,t1_fe2of7q,1578863538.0,I'm not a gambling man but I'd be willing to bet a reasonable amount of money that the person telling you about office gossip is likely to talk about you behind your back.  My advice is to give praise about the co-worker they were talking about behind their back to the office gossiper when they confront you with drama and it will slow down and stop.  Don't be a part of the drama and your life be become exponentially easier at work.
AskReddit,fe4v96h,t1_fe2me8b,1578863121.0,"I would like to add, as I'm not sure if it was explicitly stated in your comment, but no one should ever date or hookup with a co-worker.  I've watched a lot of people think this advice didn't apply to them and their situation was different somehow.  Each and every time it started out as being fun for the couple but gradually turned hellish for them and their other co-workers.  I know it's tempting but if you were wise you wouldn't give in to the temptation."

AskReddit,fde75fs,t1_fddumr5,1578332655.0,"It's all good.  :-)  I work at a spa where all the women I work on want smooth and clear skin so I always use a salt scrub in my sessions to help exfoliate their skin.  no hair is going to come close to the abrasiveness of that scrub.  The scrubs works both ways too, it helps keep my hands super soft and smooth too.  I'm a pretty muscular guy and I think most people would expect me to have rough hands but I'd be willing to bet that my hands are the softest you've ever felt thanks to that scrub."

AskReddit,fdburan,t1_fdaaqgo,1578262276.0,I think that depends on what type of bussiness you're in.  War is very lucrative for some people.
nonononoyes,fcpgbzn,t3_eidik5,1577862753.0,"This is worrisome, the cop doesn't get to make up his own interpretation of the laws and bend them to his will.  That's unethical and on a potential road to more serious offences like taking bribes and helping perpetuate crime.  I understnd some laws are unjust and the circumstances should be taken into consideration, but he was in front of a large audience with cameras!"
trashy,fcojj0c,t3_ei7261,1577833804.0,I'd like to assu e they both had good intentions.  Maybe the person smoking got too high and didn't want to risk driving impaired so called their mom.  She might have thought she was doing a good deed by picking them up after 2 beers.  Maybe I'm completely wrong for assuming this though.   The road to heck is paved with good intentions.
