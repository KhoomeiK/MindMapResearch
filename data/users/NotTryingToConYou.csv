I don't think expulsion is too harsh. Speaking from a strictly ""fairness"" perspective, the student tried, very blatantly, to get an unfair advantage. The fact that they did this more than once only shows they have no regard for their actions."

Art,fe2hzqm,t3_ennw0z,1578838517.0,"Based on the work of Ben Crombie (bencrombieart.com)

Background/Context: I'm not an artist by any stretch of the word but when I found Crombie's poster of Ada Lovelace I knew I wanted to hang it up alongside one of Alan Turing. Unfortunately, Crombie hadn't made one of him and isn't currently working on the project. So, with my very limited Photoshop skills, I made this and hung it up in my room.

UTAustin,fdtfily,t1_fdteje1,1578716023.0,"I'm at a condo (still on the third floor) but I have friends living in an apartment complex (I think it's called ""The block"") that pay similarly - not sure if it's good or not but there wasn't anything glaringly wrong when I visited. If you want to know my building's name PM me because there's still plenty apartments empty but just fyi they're all two bedrooms and 1.5 baths

If you're a biker and don't mind a tiny commute, you can also look for apartments in North Campus It's away from the West campus buzyness (I still don't find west campus to be too loud tho)

The best advice I can give you though is that find some time to actually see some places here. It's very hard to imagine yourself in a place through pictures, reviews, and numbers."
UTAustin,fdtcxlx,t3_emzqi3,1578714980.0,"I was in the same position as you were and couldn't find a single place with decent reviews. I looked for apartments through a locater and settled on one on San Gabriel Street. It is perfect and I cant imagine anything better. It's relatively fairly priced too coming in at $750 per room with parking. 

The point I'm trying to make is that it's really not all that bad. My sister has been here for two more years than I have and she also doesn't have any complaints. It really boils down to how much research you do and what your expectations are - you won't find a mansion here but you don't need to expect a crack house either"

And from a strictly statistically point of view, people with degrees earn, on average, more than people without. There's people making bank doing trades job, and more power to them, but putting people down just because they chose a different path is a dick move on your part. 

On a side note, are you just on this sub to troll for stuff like this?"
