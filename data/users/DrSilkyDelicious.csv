The best thing to do is mess with all of them and see which one suits you. There are also a lot of great stock kits in the ESX24 Sampler. 

But my music really went to the next level when I started using non-stock drum kits. There’s a site called Cymatics with a lot of free drum kits and I believe they have a lot of edm stuff. Hope this helps! Learning logic is really pretty fun"
