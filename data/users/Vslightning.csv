As long as she’s acting suspicious. Needing a break from a happy marriage could be something somebody needs after all those years. The first time in 20 years, seems a bit out of the ordinary. How does she seem around you? How annoyed was she when you were trying to go on the trip with her last time and why does it have to be this specific spot? Does she have a really niche interest? Obviously you don’t have to answer any or all of these, they’re just thinking points. I’d seriously talk to her about it all. If she acts fine when you talk to her, I wouldn’t worry much. If she’s defensive, maybe look into it more."

No it’s not fair. She’s saying she’d rather you not offend her over the correct usage of a word, than learn how you’re supposed to.

Like many ways “man” is used, it’s to encapsulate humanity (should we change that to huwomanity?) as a whole, both men and women. It wasn’t until people decided they wanted to be offended by everything that “man” in those sorts of words was stripped down to the most literal definition."

CasualConversation,fcv5395,t3_eipy4z,1577994822.0,"I quit Facebook a year or two after it took over Myspace as the most popular social media. Once it only became game invites, and people only wishing me a happy birthday because they were notified and couldn't even bother to remember, I decided I was done with that.

More recently, I quit instagram, even though I didn't post much myself. But always seeing what everybody else was getting to go do, and what I couldn't or wasn't invited to (mixed with other things) bothered me too much. On top of that, you get such a distorted view of reality. Nobody posts the ugly side of their life as equally as when things are going right. It's all a sugar coated picture that can make others feel bad they don't have the life that person is pretending to have. The only social media I have now, I don't really use for irl at all. Similar to you, I found it just brought me more pain than happiness so it wasn't worth it.

Aside from that, I spend a lot less time scrolling through other people's drama that really doesn't matter, and more time reading and studying things I find interesting. It's opened a lot more time to learn things I feel will actually help in life.

Social media has also made it much easier to spread rumors, false news, or whatever else people wanna hop on a bandwagon for without actually looking into it themselves.

Having said that, obviously I don't think all social media is bad by any means. Just not right for me, and I hope others can recognize when it's not right for them. For other people, social media can be a good way to relax and wind down. To be totally honest, some of what made it not right for me WAS social insecurities, similar to how it sounds you are.

For a while, some would offer to pay your early cancellation fee which iirc could be a decent amount of money, but brings on a new customer that should bring more money in over time through their own contract.

In this case, a lot of subscription services will offer a discounted, or even free month, to keep you on. Either hoping you change your mind, or that you simply forget to cancel your service the next billing cycle. I think that’s why most free trials still ask for your billing details. People forget to cancel after their trial, and are then on the hook for that bill.

But anyway, in this particular case, definitely NTA. Constantly changing plans and expecting everybody else to change them around you is an asshole move. Like you said, things happen.

You can research it further yourself. https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=24000

Obviously saying even the earth is only 50,000 years old still contradicts the typically accepted creation theory, so it wouldn’t really help my case if that’s what I was trying to do.

On a more personal level, a lot of people get anxiety or paranoia. At the very least mental addictions in something around 30% iirc. A recent study I just seen on Reddit showed an increase in the likelihood of smoking weed if you’re prone to depression in adolescence. (All to my best knowledge. Research the articles yourself.)

My personal only problems with it are that I’m pretty prone to falling asleep almost every time after a few hours, and although for the first couple weeks it makes things more interesting, after a few weeks, almost everything seems a lot more boring. I’m sure this is tied to other personal things, as it actually tends to help my anxiety a lot, and still helps with boredom frequently.

Frequent use is something that can tend to keep you where you’re at in life if you don’t try harder to get out of whatever pit you’re in that’s making you want to smoke all the time to begin with.

This was during their 40/40 period as well that I cancelled under. It was a surprise to find out part of my initial cost on the paintings was including the shipping out to me, as it was my understanding everything I was paying for was the paintings, and shipping out to me was covered either way, and I’d be cancelling or receiving a refund of everything I had paid/agreed to pay. If I knew I was going to spend $800 in shipping alone, I never would have returned them. They were not clear at all and it took me multiple times of emailing and calling them to even find out how to properly return the paintings. They did not communicate with me well at all on any aspects except when they needed to tell me what I needed to hear to sign on buying some.

To summarize, what bothers me the most about the whole ordeal is how poorly they communicated the return process and what all that actually entails. Not finding out $300 would be sacrificed from the initial cost until after I had nearly completed the whole return."
