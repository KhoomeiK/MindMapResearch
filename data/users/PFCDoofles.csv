That would make the explanation of the difference between PT and OT/ST simple: training. PT jedi were simply better trained to use their lightsabers than luke or Rey. The only people we see chop limbs in the OT are all prequel-trained force users, or luke at peak rage, so that tracks.

Also, you clearly know that most people don't feel that way if you know it's also cool to say ""a mix is best."" A mix is best. Doing everything practically is time consuming, expensive, limiting, and ineffective. A poorly done miniature shot is just as immersion breaking as poorly done CG.

Especially for the time, this is good CG and good composite. For the most part I don't have any trouble accepting that the hobbits and orcs (costumed actors) are inhabiting the same space as the scenery and ents (Practical models and CG.)

I'm not even a woman, just an easy Mark for one of the numerous men who put themselves in positions where they can easily victimize people.

Two nerdy club leaders from my era at OSU are now registered sex offenders who assaulted multiple people. One of them is the brother of one of My best Friends from elementary school and the other assaulted me within 10 minutes of meeting me.

I had another friend in elementary school (from a completely different part of town) whose stepdad turned out to be a serial rapist and child abuser. That was my next door neighbor for four years.

One of my sisters was attacked while getting off the subway in a major east coast city. The city had him on camera the next day using her credit card and didn't follow up.

 The other, on the opposite coast, had to walk from a job because she was being sexually harassed and had to appeal the state to get unemployment because they didn't believe her or even ask for proof until she challenged it in court.

This is a real thing. All of these men are also examples in some other person's life. I don't know why this stat is so hard to believe.
