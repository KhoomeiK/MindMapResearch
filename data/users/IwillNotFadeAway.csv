AskWomenOver30,ffer1dt,t3_esujck,1579861255.0,"First - I’m am incredibly proud of your strength and perseverance. I didn’t read your original post but I fully read this one and I admire you!

Secondly - you’re an incredible writer. It’s literally 5am and I didn’t plan on being on Reddit long at all and I was enthralled by your post and your writing. If your career doesn’t involve writing, I encourage you to explore it as a hobby or a side gig.  You have a way with words that really suck the reader in - and you’re just saying what you’ve gone through in the last couple of months. Imagine if you were writing fiction and could take it wherever you wanted!? I would totally read it based on your writing style here alone!

Third - again, incredibly proud of your strength and self love. Congrats on the new job, moving on from a hurtful past, and finding a new guy!!! I truly wish the best for you in all parts of your life."

I know the klonopin has been making me sicker so I’m looking forward to the other side. 

Thankfully I have coping strategies for my anxiety already because the meds haven’t worked for a while. Glad I never increased my dose either. 

Just want to get this poison out of me!

Crossing my fingers! Thanks again!"
