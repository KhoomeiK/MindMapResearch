EDH,fffuoev,t3_esybo8,1579892183.0,"Mtg on reddit as a whole is toxic af. There are plenty of decent people in the community but they are drowned out by the opinionated, snobby, holier than thou douchewaffles that it makes a lot of people just not participate on reddit with mtg. Currently I follow this sub and the arena sub. I just started with both. This comes after a year of removing anything magic from my reddit. I've played since 93 and love the game but hate the obnoxious player base that alienates many people and gives mtg a bad rap. My group of cEDH players, all playing for around 10 years, is to the point that we rarely allow anyone outside of our small group in because people dont understand when we tell them our group plays for fun. One example is the dude that shows up with his stack of tournament EDH decks and waits til he sees everyone's commander before selecting a deck he thinks we cant stop before he tutors for a win on turn 4 or 5. This isnt to say any of us arent good at magic but when we want to play competitive mtg we go to tournaments. We play janky ass shit and play for fun and laughs while we drink and bullshit, not to shuffle every 4th or 5th round. One guy thought that bringing his gameboy was a great idea. Every time it was his turn we had to notify him that it was his turn. He would then proceed to take his sweet ass time studying the board and asking everyone what they played on their turn. Another person was that ""control"" player that would tell everyone to wait after they played anything and then decide if he was going to do anything. I really mean anything that was played or any board action and I am not exaggerating. He would do this with no cards in hand and nothing he could do with his board. We had the rhystic study guy. He would put it in every deck and tutor it as quickly as he could. He would then stare at you and and tap his card when you triggered it. I offered a way that would make it easier for everyone to see and remember. I said he could put it at the top of his playmat rather than mixed in with his cards or covered by his lands. 

My group likes to build and tweak decks to optimize them so that the janky shenanigans can ensue but once they become dominate they get set to the side until we play the one game a night where we all pull out the S tier decks.

Is it really that hard for people to see these things they do or am I expecting too much out of people?

I'm assuming I'll get downvoted for this.
