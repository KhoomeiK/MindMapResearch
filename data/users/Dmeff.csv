First, they say that they didn't reach significance in the differences between composition, and it's no wonder with an n=7 and such a huge difference in values. However, if you check the individual data for each woman, there is hardly any trend. While some women had basically no change between BSU S and ASU, some women have massive differences. Most extreme example is P5 who had a massive spike of PSA. Looking at this data and reporting ""there is no significant change"" is silly.

Second, there is this review that has a lot of cool info from other papers 
https://sci-hub.tw/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23634659

What I understand from that review (at 3am) is that there are two distinct phenomena: squirting, which ranges from ""super similar to urine"" to ""somewhat similar to urine"" and female ejaculation (which is very different and comes entirely from the female prostate). To confound these phenomena even further, they often happen together.

As a personal anecdote, I've been pee'd on and squirted on multiple times and they don't smell nor taste the same.

Sorry for the long rant"
