Eh, I forgot about most of them. Forgot about the Ryes until I played ND, and they were the least worst characters. Took me a while to figure out who they are until a few hours in. 

Most Far Cry characters, post-2, are more wilfully edgy that good. Most of them make no sense in the wider narrative. 

>The story about religious cult was also very good and plausible, lots of similarities to ISIS in Syria, if you followed the news there. VERY similar... so that realistic aspect really was awesome.

But not in Montana. ISIS came about after a massive US foreign-policy fuckup (Bremer firing the Iraqi army); their presence in Syria is because the Arab Spring rolled across the region and triggered the Syrian Civil war and ISIS jumped at the opportunity.

No matter the shit that's going on with the outside world, no one believes the FBI wouldn't have gone full Ruby Ridge on the Peggies as soon as your chopper went down. And before someone says ""But Nancy kept that quiet for the Seeds!"" yeah, no. I doubt a single sheriff's office is the only way to get a message out of the valley. For god's sake, Hope County is still getting tourists in the middle of the ""war"". 

And the whole World War III thing is such an obvious half-assed fudge to cover this poor premise up.

To compare ISIS to a bunch of pseudo-philosophical manbunned stoners is selling ISIS short. 

>Also it made sense that so many enemies hunted you...you were a FUGITIVE!! The deputy was literally the most wanted person in the valley, so of course every hippie with a gun would be roaming the streets for you. And as soon as you liberated a region, you did have peaceful time again to go fishing or what.

Well, save for the fact fully three-quarters of the actual population of the Valley wants to help you, and actually does, and they recognise your authority as a Deputy. That's not really being a fugitive. 

>I also liked the customization parts for roleplaying purposes. I dont mind no voice: literally the same as in Skyrim: it's good for roleplaying your character.

I agree; I really don't get why people are so insistent your player have a voice, since none of the previous protagonists ever used their implied agency for anything other than nodding along with whatever harebrained scheme NPC has put in front of them, or just nod along with whatever radioed insult the antagonist has just slung at you. There's a dissonance there: the protagonist is clearly carving a swathe through enemy's force, and clearly pissing off the antagonist, yet never calls them out on it. 

>There could have been more weapons imo, but there were so many customizations and skins, I didnt mind.

I like the customisations, but the fact is the weapons really haven't changed much since FC3. In fact, I've always ended up with pretty much the same loadouts for the last three games (and ND): MS16, M-79, Vector, and the bullpup .50 cal.

I do like that they now have ROF selection. That was an improvement. 

> And the villains Joseph, Faith and Joseph are my favorites, they were so well played and NOT comically overplayed as villains. You could believe that they really believed in their twisted ways, just like a real ISIS muslim.

Comically overplayed? No. Comically overwrought? Definitely. Ubisoft spent so much time playing up the deep it-could-happen-here-and-oh-look-Christians-are-just-as-bad edginess for FC5's marketing, but ultimately ended up saying nothing. 

That's not a triumph of writing or design, but simply of Ubi's marketing and legal departments. The pseudo-philosophy forced down your throat during the interminable monologues contains nothing of any real weight, other than a few vague, legally-safe allusions to God's will. It's kinda impressive how they managed to rabbit on for so long and say nothing. Then again, that's the lawyers' input into it. 

Worst of all, it's just boring. And the fact that Ubi feels we'd be interested in listening to Manbun Jesus-Appropriater instead of putting a bullet in him is most galling of all."

It feels like a linear shooter jammed in an open world; I remember playing it and wondering if they hired some ex-COD designers. 

And that's not even touching upon the terrible story missions, which pretty much play out the say way: Ubi needs a way to let the baddies monologue at you for five minutes, so they're scripted to hell, you get your normal gameplay tools removed from you, which is flat-out not fun. 

Hence why they had to kidnap you - I don't think any one would seek out the main missions after doing one or two of them if they had a choice not to. 

5 is definitely more scripted, more curated, and less organic than anything that's come before. And that's not good for an open-world game."

Pretty much every story mission in Five involves the tired, lazy trope of completely disarming the character and removing them out of the stream and context of normal gameplay. 

I don't know about anyone else, but I don't play a Far Cry game because I want some CGI fuckwit monologuing high-school grade philosophy at me while I walk in slow motion through a bad approximation of the end of *Apocalypse Now*. 

I sincerely think that the FC writers all suck at writing...*for video games*. Hence why they have to keep breaking the game to get their missions across - like knocking you out (or having character just randomly decide to put their weapons away). It might be fine when the reader doesn't have control over the character - as in a movie or book - but in a video game it feels cheap and insulting. 

Most setups for the main missions could be solved in about three minutes by the player - if they were allowed to continue under normal gameplay. 

> If you want to force capture me, fine, but make me fight some big ass battle where there's no way out but being captured. 

I love that Far Cry 2 actually did that, and it was logical, made sense within the world. You were trapped inside a building, and could fight and fight and fight, but would eventually, of course, run out of ammo - you'd never have enough to counter the swarms of mercs. And then you'd get taken down. There was no ""Fuck it, some chick comes up and blows powder in his face because he's put his guns down"". 

(Hell, FC2 was great at conveying a lot of the story and exposition via gameplay, not interminable cutscenes. But a lot of gamers like being spoonfed, I guess, and hated it.)

Clint Hocking coined the term ""ludo-narrative dissonance"" for a reason, for when the gameplay mechanics and incentives are at odds with the narrative directives, and it's a worthy critique of a lot of games - and especially the later FCs.

Clint was the director for FC2.

There's no incentive to do the main quests over general exploration, and they knew it. So they had to forced you to do them.

For an open-world game, this ain't great. This isn't being able to approach the game how you'd like it, but force you along. I'd offer a greater critique of the story, but frankly, I ignored most of it and either played with my phone or just flat-out skipped the cut scenes.

The world was way too crowded - on the roads. You had Peggies, resistance, animal attacks, random civilians, trucks, enemy vehicles, friendly vehicles, planes. Weirder still was the spawning of these seemed to be all synchronised. 

You'd see a group of Peggies, and gear up to take them down. You'd take a shot-

-but, suddenly! A Peggy quad appears! And now you have to deal with that so you-

-oh no! A wandering trader has wandered into the firefight! Quick, you better help-

-shit! A supply truck! If you don't get this, you won't see another one for ages, and you could really use those-

-FUCK! Now a bear is attacking you! Quick, kill it before it knocks you-

-JESUS! Now you're being strafed by a plane!

And, instead of a satisfying fight, you just get a big ball of chaos where you waste ammo, can't control the fight, end up losing any one-time loot, and often end up simply running away, because you'd get quickly overwhelmed. All these elements would just pop-in outside your field of view, too, so you can't know about them before the fight starts. 

And then you could wander for ages before anything happens again.

If I had to guess, the devs came up with all these brilliant ideas, put them in the game...but never sat down and thought about (or tested) *how these systems interacted with one another.*

The animals and the Peggies, for example, are all wired to prioritise you over each other. So instead of the Peggies shitting themselves at the giant furry murderbeast, they'd still pour fire on you because they knew it only going after you. 

Another one was that because the roads were long, flat, and you could see way down them, and trucks needed to spawn in the same cell, they couldn't spawn while you were on the road. What they tended to do was spawn when you were fifty or so yards *off* the road, and by the time you could sprint back to get into a position to take out the driver, they'd be long gone. 

What's worse is that if you did manage to survive all this, because of RAM issues, half the loot would be culled. Nothing like managing to sniper the driver of a truck only to find it disappeared because it rolled a hundred meters past you and a bunch of dogs showed up to attack you. 

You could wander off track, but aside from the occasional animal or fisherman, there really was nothing out there. I'm wondering if they did this to make the tiny, homogeneously-styled world feel ""bigger"", to make you feel more isolated. 

The main missions are just terrible scripts, utterly disconnected from the core gameplay. That's a major red flag for me, too."
