I know people reload $1 to their Amazon account 20 times, is that still a relevant trick?

Appreciate any feedback."

Netflix is free with TMO. 

Hulu + Spotify = $5 a month (Student Discount - buy student email address of the Bay) so $60 a year. Someone who really needed Amazon Prime gave me their login for Prime Video.  

Total cost per year: $102.50 or $8.55 a month."
