When meteors and space trash get too close to earth, they get *pulled in* by Earth's *gravitational pull*. Usually they end up *burning up in the atmosphere* but some big pieces do eventually end up hitting the earth. This is why we are able to see what kinds of metals/elements are in space debris.

As the moon is *much much* larger than the Earth, at some point in this hypothetical situation if the moon got caught in the *gravitational pull* and no longer orbited the Earth but instead was on a collision course, I am wanting to know how long it would take for the moon to hit the earth.

This is what I am asking.

Not....whatever it is you're referencing in your original comment, which doesn't even mention once how long it would take. That is all I am asking. How. Long. Would. It. Take.

You don't really seem to have the answer though so I'm not super interested in anything else you have to say."
unpopularopinion,ffgrgve,t1_ffgrcyx,1579913181.0,Except....I literally just did? I listed off several things I found interest in about Japan/Japanese culture despite the fact I didn't even go in depth into them much if at all.
unpopularopinion,ffgqgg3,t3_et9jbh,1579912452.0,"Well maybe if you don't want to be seen as a weeb...learn more about the culture besides anime, samurai, and katana...like...hmmmm....idk the literal years of war, how the culture has evolved beautifully to involve old tradition while still swiftly moving towards technology and science...food... history, music, architecture, transportation,social constructs in Japan, ect, etc, ect....maybe even consider *learning* the language, and actually *visiting* the country?

I mean sure you could call me a weeb because I started taking 4 years of Japanese language in highschool because I liked anime and manga....but I learned much more than how to say something was cute, or my name is, or any other stereotypical Japanese sentence a weeb would say. I immersed myself in the culture, visited the country, stayed with host family's, loved the food, and the traditions, and how beautiful it is there, and really I can't be classified as a weeb anymore because of *how much more I learned than I ever thought I would* about Japan."

answers,ffgoqso,t1_ffgh8mn,1579911236.0,I don't think you are understanding my question to be honest. None of what you have said has to do with what I've asked at all....
