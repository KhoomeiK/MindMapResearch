I think that’s the main issue.

But regarding your second question I’m also not sure as I don’t see it as appealing. I always thought it was just to show how very hard someone is working out? Then again it does make muscles look bigger and more defined, so I guess the appeal isn’t in the sweat itself but in the effect it gives."

However, that doesn’t change the fact that some sweaty people  smell very, very bad. Just because YOU SPECIFICALLY don’t doesn’t mean others don’t; because YOU SPECIFICALLY had luck that your body chemistry is such that you found a deodorant that works isn’t a general rule. Some people will sweat right through that deodorant and stink because that’s their body chemistry, that’s their body microflora and the combination of their specific sweat produces a stink no matter what. I know men who tried every single deodorant and antiperspirant on the market and not one helped.  (Yes, women tend to have less smelly “sweat” because of less testosterone. I’m using the inverted commas because otherwise you’ll get hung up on the details again.) The smell can be a deeply disturbing thing for everyone around you and it is treatable. If it’s something that happens once or twice as an accident - hey, it happens. But if it happens on a regular basis there is no reason to live with it and FORCE everyone around you to live with it.

On the other hand, I get the sweat thing. Deodorant can only go so far and while some some people are wet but non-smelly most people will begin to smell at some point if the sweating is so profound. And sweating specifically in the pit area is not unnecessary for our health. As long as the body can release that sweat somewhere else you’re fine. You can get your pits botoxed and you will stop sweating in the underarm area with no adverse health reactions."

As far as D3 goes it’s not so much a vegan thing but a climate/lifestyle thing. If you live in a temperate climate you would have to spend, on average, some eight hours a day, every day, all year round, to get your natural D3, and that’s if you don’t use sunscreen at all (sunscreen impedes D3 synthesis). Note this is a yearly average; a twenty-minute walk in the summer will be enough (strong sunlight and short clothes), while in the winter you wouldn’t have enough light hours in a day to make enough D3 (little to no direct sunlight, heavy clothes).
