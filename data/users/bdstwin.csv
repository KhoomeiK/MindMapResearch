Testosterone,ff9sy5y,t1_ff913ak,1579720570.0,are you a licensed doctor?
socialanxiety,ff5vw7w,t3_emtgtb,1579612032.0,Typically improvement comes from both medication and CBT. Not taken separate. I’m sorta in the same boat though. I’m getting my hormones checked again as I believe they have been chronically unbalanced since puberty
socialanxiety,ff4o4ll,t1_ff4lqrn,1579568350.0,Have you checked your hormones ?
socialanxiety,ff4o2r5,t3_erl52i,1579568313.0,Um yeah this is my life

Testosterone,ff389vk,t1_ff376ad,1579536041.0,I’ve had some symptoms going back to my early 20s and late teens. Do men need different amounts of T to feel “normal”?
Testosterone,ff36o3n,t1_ff36g9x,1579534963.0,Acm labs. I’m calling them today to get my results. I don’t think my endo has a clue
Testosterone,ff33xeo,t1_ff334yn,1579533048.0,"I still have symptoms. No morning wood for the past 10 years, brain fog, no confidence etc.  even when I was younger with higher T, these problems still persisted although not as bad now"
socialanxiety,ff06wce,t1_ff02nnf,1579465803.0,Yup true. I all I do is compare myself to others. The whole “keeping up with family and friends” is a myth. At least the way I use it
Eminem,feyxh9g,t1_fev7m4b,1579451634.0,Trump knew about Pedo island and only went there once. Bill Clinton meanwhile went over 30 times.
Testosterone,fevl90s,t1_femm5nl,1579398750.0,Men need to look at their hormones a lot more closely instead of spending hours in therapy
socialanxiety,feo76pg,t3_eq5u2m,1579296026.0,I think I look scarred shitless
Eminem,feo4x7c,t3_epw27m,1579295142.0,Saw the album cane out when I woke up at 6. Listened to the whole thing immediately after
socialanxiety,fenqtr2,t3_epz93y,1579289488.0,Hard to tell sometimes.  I think I open up if people approach me but I hesitate making the first move. I am introverted as well although idk if that’s mainly SAD or both
socialanxiety,fenmhzs,t3_eq2ys6,1579287856.0,Typically account questions are handled by the cubicles. The teller would tell you the same thing. Take a seat in the waiting area and relax until someone comes to get you. I worked in banking for a few years

socialanxiety,femq3j1,t1_fem687r,1579266273.0,I haven’t addressed the T because doctors don’t prescribe anything unless your levels are dangerously low. It’s not about quality of life to them
socialanxiety,feloi1t,t3_ep22pq,1579227090.0,Good luck.  I didn’t find therapy that helpful but then again I can’t afford to keep up many visits
socialanxiety,felofmx,t3_ep2awy,1579227044.0,I hear ya. I’m about to turn 31 and have these exact thoughts. The good news is that social anxiety is actually quite common which means a lot of resources are available.
socialanxiety,felo4w9,t3_ep5w1w,1579226840.0,I’m about to turn 31 and just came to realize most of my issues have revolved around social anxiety. It’s actually pretty common as far as mental health is concerned. There are many options out there. It’s nice to know other people go through this shit as well

Testosterone,feldply,t1_feldnbd,1579219760.0,You become more anxious on Test?
socialanxiety,felbgui,t1_felakrb,1579218272.0,I didn’t have any trauma growing up. The only thing I can think of is that I had a fraternal twin brother who did most of the socializing for us growing up. He was sort of a security blanket. Perhaps I never developed social skills on my own or developed my own confidence? Idk
socialanxiety,fel6ql3,t1_fel6blj,1579215250.0,"I have low T, could that be a root cause? Even as a kid I have always been more timid but this is becoming too much. My quality of life has been shit for too long"
Testosterone,fekzfq3,t1_fekyuhx,1579210802.0,What about your confidence or social skills ?

socialanxiety,fekvopf,t1_fej3zp9,1579208562.0,True. Doesn’t help that most of this generation has mental issues tho. I blame meds and lost of moral codes
socialanxiety,fekvk1d,t3_eple8l,1579208485.0,Yeah it fucking sucks and meds/therapy haven’t made a huge difference
Testosterone,feksaby,t1_feks1ke,1579206558.0,How?

intermittentfasting,fe4ikc4,t3_enshcn,1578859690.0,Look at the results. They speak for themselves
intermittentfasting,fdzstc6,t3_enggig,1578794967.0,I consume 1500-1800 with about 2400 TDEE. It’s really important you measure as many calories as you can. Don’t guess. They add up quick!
intermittentfasting,fdzshkn,t1_fdzs4j1,1578794742.0,What does it matter?
intermittentfasting,fdzsgpk,t3_engvpd,1578794726.0,No keep going.  That won’t break the fast
introvert,fdwmtux,t1_fdt5ndj,1578760292.0,Yes I have demonstrated great resilience in the face of adversity

introvert,fdsixot,t1_fdsg8un,1578703634.0,Yeah they are enthusiastic about sales. I fucking hate that culture
introvert,fds8oul,t1_fds6f50,1578696886.0,I was sales rep of the month back in October but I absolutely hate the sales process and culture. Idk I never pursued anything else as this is all I’ve known since college
introvert,fdqy2c5,t1_fdquhhk,1578676523.0,Not really mainly because I don’t know how to change in that regard. I’ve started to exercise to get back in shape so maybe that will bring back some confidence
introvert,fdpnfm7,t1_fdpn4lr,1578633676.0,Idk but I’ve always been this way. Maybe it’s my temperament. I’m heavily introverted so I tend to overthink things
socialskills,fdpndbp,t1_fdpmt20,1578633620.0,What’s the difference between work friends and real friends ?
socialskills,fdplnht,t3_eio0mh,1578632096.0,This sounds exactly my situation. I actually feel bad for my co worker as he is a 45 year old telemarketer who desperately tries to form friendships. He lives with his cat and dad. I’ve come to resent him over the months because he is pushing this “friendship” onto me.  he makes me feel guilty about not spending time with him as I always come up with excuses as to why I can’t hang outside of work. And I have to work with him. It’s weird as hell man
introvert,fdpkb8z,t1_fdpjqg7,1578630977.0,“I’m sure you’re all wondering why you’re here right now “
introvert,fdpjhmx,t3_emfri5,1578630306.0,This sounds like my job and situation exactly. I feel drained every day and yet I’ve been doing customer service and sales for almost 10 years. It’s all I’ve known since college. No wonder my depression and anxiety has only gotten worse. Anyone else find a way out into a job they like?
introvert,fdn9u9t,t3_em8qhi,1578581083.0,Worrying that they will move on to someone else
SeattleNHL,fdlaza8,t3_elzff9,1578520177.0,EDIT: This isn’t official. I was just saying I think we found the “look”. It fits the red theme so far
introvert,fdklhgp,t1_fdkl3lp,1578506014.0,I love animals and I’m passionate about politics. I enjoy movies and I seem to have a creative side to me as well. Writing comes naturally to me although I don’t enjoy reading ironically
introvert,fdkf21a,t1_fdkb26d,1578502502.0,All I want to do is work in an area where I can make a living and not be drained from people all day
introvert,fdk96fz,t3_eloayx,1578498914.0,I need a solid 30-40 minutes in the morning before I talk to anyone
introvert,fdk940v,t3_eljje0,1578498873.0,Yup same. I’ve spent most of my 20s trying to fit in and ended up getting anxiety and depression because I felt different than everyone else. Now that I know why and I’m embracing introversion
introvert,fdk8zyz,t3_elrmw6,1578498802.0,"Introverts tend to take longer to find themselves or their role in life. We process things deeply , therefore it takes us longer to get where we need to be. I’ve always known I’m more timid but I finally realized how unique my introversion was"
introvert,fdk8vhk,t3_elsu4v,1578498723.0,Going to college was one of the worst parts of my life. I had to take a year off because I completely fell apart. I was put in therapy and on meds. I’m finally realizing that I’m introverted and to embrace that temperament. I’ve tried to be “normal” and took jobs in sales and customer service. No wonder I’ve been miserable for so long
introvert,fdk8qcs,t3_elsxzm,1578498632.0,Yup I daydream that I’m a confident outspoken person. The ironic part is that I still can be confident and outspoken but only when I have the energy. It’s interesting learning how I work
introvert,fdjwvdn,t1_fdjw5gn,1578490077.0,What do I say? It’s weird in the office now
introvert,fdjwuve,t1_fdjw5gn,1578490065.0,That’s why I removed their numbers because I thought what’s the point? We’ve been working together for over a year and I’m just tired of forcing these social interactions. I pick my friends very carefully
introvert,fdjvumj,t1_fdjux6u,1578489185.0,Right? I feel guilty but it’s like they forced this friendship on me. They don’t understand it takes me a long time to be comfortable around people and even then it’s a possibility our personalities  don’t mesh. I don’t want to do the group text after work. I’m fucking burnt out man
socialanxiety,fdilwyr,t1_fdil14s,1578445832.0,I guess you could call them that
socialanxiety,fdi91no,t1_fdi7yjw,1578437913.0,I had their names in my phone for over a year but took them out recently  because I’m promoting into a different position in a week and I don’t plan on keeping up with them. They are nice to work with but I’m moving on
socialanxiety,fdi3x6y,t1_fdi3qhm,1578435291.0,They know I don’t have a SO. The truth is I’m an introvert and want to leave work at work
intermittentfasting,fdhqh8m,t1_fdholwt,1578428161.0,"Yes , fasting make things clearer. No wonder humans have been doing for thousands of years lol"
intermittentfasting,fdhobdx,t3_elfbqc,1578426874.0,Definitely think about how much you want to drop weight. How long it took to get to this point etc Puts everything into perspective
intermittentfasting,fdhcfhk,t3_elexaq,1578419885.0,"When your body goes without food for a certain amount of time, it enters a period of fat burning as it uses its own fat cells as energy. Reduced calories is something you can add on that. I could fast for 20 hours but eat 3000 calories in 4 hours. Wouldn’t do me much good. It’s a balance"
intermittentfasting,fdgt5ea,t1_fdgsfz9,1578407665.0,I have around 60 pounds of fat to lose. I try to cut 800 calories below TDEE everyday
intermittentfasting,fdgqquy,t1_fdgq8bf,1578405858.0,So that’s 15-20 pounds in 30 days? Seems unrealistic but I’ll go for it anyways
introvert,fdgqmu0,t3_elbpda,1578405768.0,Take your dog out with you more often. Work from there
intermittentfasting,fdgp5dk,t1_fdgjsv7,1578404582.0,What was your BMI when you started and finished?
intermittentfasting,fdgp24n,t3_elbjt2,1578404507.0,It’s a struggle since the longest I can go is 45 hours. I’m starting OMAD and seeing how that goes for a while. I need to find rhythm
intermittentfasting,fdfg4lf,t3_el3ihb,1578360904.0,How long are you fasting
intermittentfasting,fdeen7k,t1_fdedz9q,1578337363.0,Yup. I’m 33 right now. Anything above 33 is considered obese level 2. Anything above 30 is obese level 1. Only way to go is up! Good luck man
intermittentfasting,fdedr0n,t1_fdeawu3,1578336804.0,What’s your BMI?
intermittentfasting,fdeap6k,t1_fde8lyv,1578334896.0,Listen to your body. If you feel like your about to pass out then obviously break. Slow and steady!
intermittentfasting,fde8a15,t3_ekxfy2,1578333361.0,See if you can continue that fast. Granted you are of high BMI and need to lose a lot of fat.
intermittentfasting,fde877r,t3_ekxi57,1578333311.0,I was about the same weight as you and have a similar goal weight. The key is consistency. You need to make life style changes as well. Fasting will help lose fat but you need to maintain your lean body mass afterwards. Sometimes slow and steady is the way.
introvert,fde81ox,t3_ekwzda,1578333214.0,Look up high sensitive people. Very similar to introverts. Everything is on a spectrum
socialanxiety,fde7x68,t3_ekxi4k,1578333134.0,I’m going through this right now at work. It’s a sales call center and I’m tired of worrying about people listening to me
socialanxiety,fde7usz,t3_ekwj3l,1578333093.0,It’s social anxiety. Speak with someone and take a cognitive approach. We can learn to rewire our brains over time :)
socialanxiety,fddq00q,t3_ekue4e,1578320864.0,Sounds like a real mature workspace. Jk it sounds like mine. I work in sales and surrounded by border line retarded extroverts. My advice is to get a new position within the company or pursue something else
socialanxiety,fddnz8u,t3_eklg0z,1578319127.0,You and me both.  All I really want is to live with a nice girl and a dog. Very simple lol
socialanxiety,fddnthy,t3_ektqg1,1578318988.0,Be careful because I said those exact things and my psychiatrist thought I had schizophrenia. And then another doctor thought I had ocd
socialanxiety,fddn7lt,t3_ekmcs0,1578318440.0,I’m this way as well. Build some confidence and learn to not give a fuck about other people. It’s so nice to have this feeling
introvert,fddm2jt,t3_eku0jj,1578317374.0,Welcome to introversion. My advice would be to focus on what makes you happy and work from there. If you want to meet someone special then you need to step outside your comfort zone. There’s probably an introverted girl out there but you need to find her.
introvert,fddkntz,t3_ekl6d7,1578315964.0,I work in sales all day and barely have any energy for socializing after work. Time to get out of sales!
introvert,fddklg8,t3_eksiqh,1578315897.0,People ask me why I don’t get a roommate to help cut down on costs. I’d rather be homeless than share my space with someone. Unless I find a nice girl but until then ..
