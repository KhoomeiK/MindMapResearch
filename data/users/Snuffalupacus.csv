GetMotivated,ffb90xn,t1_ffb7kso,1579755607.0,I'm starting therapy next week. I'm in the same boat and just feel like my life has no meaning and I'm at the end of days. There is a lot of fuck ups on my plate right now. I can only think the worst is yet to come. I miss my gf so much..hearts heal. Maybe one day all can be forgiven.
Advice,feskixg,t3_eqf5hm,1579366197.0,I hope you can make it work. I'm in the same position just much different. I dont think we will ever work things out. I'm certain her and her children will never forgive me. We both are going to better ourselves and see what time apart from one another can do. If you know she is the one for you and your children please find a way...
Advice,fekadkp,t1_feka1a6,1579195922.0,Also if you don't tell her you are struggling with money then it's just on you. My ex didn't pay on bills as much as I would like and I did not say anything to her till it was too late.
Advice,feka1a6,t3_epjc4f,1579195721.0,"My advice to you is to get a better job. I'm not trying to be an ass but making more for the time you put in really helps. I know it's not as easy as looking into the job market and ""bam"" I have a good paying job. I'm in a situation where I think nothing will ever get better, but I'm blessed to have a good job. I think people get stuck in the grind and don't realize they could be doing better. Sorry if this doesn't help because I don't know the details of your profession."
Advice,fek86c7,t1_fejr5yh,1579194622.0,"Haha I like this way of thinking. If only it was that easy. I made a mistake in my relationship and just want us to go back to being happy, but there is just so much that has to be mended. Time will slowly eat away at me before I realise it's probably just too late."
GetMotivated,fcjxu0q,t1_fcjs1a4,1577709763.0,Like a dip of tobacco? I know why I want her back and I know the weeds that need to be pulled. Its not that simple.
GetMotivated,fchq5ra,t3_eh97nx,1577652958.0,Accepting what can't be changed is my downfall currently. All mind wants to do is find that loophole where everything will go back to the way it was. I know its not possible but it's driving me insane. Any pointers on how to ease these thoughts so I can just move on?
domesticviolence,fc636g2,t1_fc62l4f,1577471228.0,That's the thing though. We have been talking on FB and I guess the love we had has just made her blame herself. There's much more to it than I just slapped her but she almost chooses to look over everything else. I know I hurt her and will never change but I know she is as broken as me and I just made it worse. Her stuff is still here and I've told her recently to get it out. I know she doesn't have the means to do so. I know I need to server this link but I can't.
