leafs,fguzfi1,t1_fguwcp5,1581132959.0,I had the same opinion. He seemed more alert than I've ever seen Hutch too. Hutch always looks like he cracks partway through the game mentally and just gives up (or maybe that's just me projecting). Campbell just seemed to *move* more too.

hitmanimals,fgu6kxg,t1_fgt7gqv,1581114097.0,"German shepherds (which I love) are like Corvettes, Malis (which I also love) are like Ferraris. People get Malinois thinking they're like German Shepherds and they end up with way more than they can handle. Both breeds are super smart but Malis crush it on the energy front and are almost impossible to tire out."

atheism,fgrgwv5,t1_fgrcw51,1581046530.0,Welllll....they pay quite a bit to their upper leadership. Not sure if they get formal dividends (they guard their finances pretty well) but I honestly wouldn't be surprised. Such a bunch of fucking crooks.
