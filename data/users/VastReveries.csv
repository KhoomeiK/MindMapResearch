I'm not bullshitting, and I'm not sharing my name with you on a public forum. I have a 4 year degree in nutrition in dietetics from a university accredited with the [Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics](https://www.eatrightpro.org/acend/accredited-programs/didactic-programs-in-dietetics). I am currently a dietetic intern at a separate accredited university where I'm obtaining a Master of Public Health as well as qualifying to be a registered dietitian nutritionist. I work in community health, and I will be switching to acute care with a focus on medical nutrition therapy. 7 years of education is just a start in this field, but I know enough to say that *you don't know shit*."

DemocraticSocialism,fdpiipv,t1_fdp92zs,1578629550.0,Reread my original comment. That isn't what I said.
SCAcirclejerk,fdpieul,t1_fdpi61g,1578629466.0,"I haven't watched it because I know it will be triggering to me. I assume she behaves exactly how I do with my eating disorder. Like I said, people have to learn how to cope with triggers they may see or experience. I wanted to go watch her after hearing about her on Reddit. Years of therapy taught me that it wouldn't be a good idea to watch someone actively denying a rampant eating disorder."
SCAcirclejerk,fdpi6f9,t1_fdpbcql,1578629284.0,"I'm a health professional, and if I revealed I had an active eating disorder I could lose any job I possess. In dietetics, I see this ALL THE TIME. She is the extreme of a spectrum of disordered eating with an eating disorder (most likely). I can't tell you how many celebrities, politicians, public figures, health professionals, influencers, and laypeople on the internet spout things that are just as problematic. I'm glad that people can recognize that the behaviors she exhibits are disordered because some people genuinely think that exercise with a restrictive diet is healthy. There are plenty of doctors, dietitians, chiropractors, nurses, physical therapists, and other health professions who give poor health information and overstep their own scope of practice. Its a shame that people might see her as the epitome of health, of course, but the law as it is currently written protects her right to showcase this lifestyle."
SCAcirclejerk,fdphnv9,t1_fdphb9i,1578628890.0,"Here's something crazy - I'm (almost) a registered dietitian with an active long-term eating disorder. I'm not saying her videos give good advice, and perhaps she shouldn't speak to wellness-related topics like that. However, she shouldn't have to disclose her ED to talk about skincare videos. I'm sure her content is triggering which is why I've never watched it. There are lots of triggers and it is up to the individual to learn how to cope with these triggers."
SCAcirclejerk,fdpa0vb,t1_fdoqzwh,1578623488.0,"I don't think anyone should be forced to talk about their ED. I talk about mine because its taboo and rampant in my profession. However, she has the right to her privacy for health-related matters. Eating disorders are ultimately psychiatric illnesses that can manifest in physical ways, but that doesn't mean she needs to ""warn people"" about her condition."
SCAcirclejerk,fdp9t63,t1_fdoo8tc,1578623345.0,I've spent 2 years in eating disorder treatment. While it's possible she has another disease... I just get a feeling it's an ED. It even looks like she has lanugo in that thumbnail. I have never watched one of her videos because I worry it'll be too triggering.

illnessfakers,fdoq64s,t3_embv20,1578610376.0,"I honestly moved over to the other related subreddits because of the poor, mildly cruel moderation. Have you considered seeking more competent moderators to add to your team? In addition, it is infuriating to see non-blogging discussions where incorrect health science is perpetuated. I'm genuinely not sure how this can be fixed, but I thought it was worth noting that its one of the reasons I migrated over."
