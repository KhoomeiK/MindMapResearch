Parenting,fdsrcvl,t3_emtkx2,1578706947.0,"It's refreshing to read this.  I'll just say, I originally clicked on the title expecting to be tilted a little. I had the assumption you were on the opposite side of the fence and I was already getting ticked, lol.  I have this attitude that kids will be kids and it's important to encourage and reinforce that curiosity.  Manners are great and I agree that's important, but not at  the cost of completely stifling their inquisitive spirit.  

My daughter is this social butterfly of a 3 year old who has no fear when it comes to running up to someone and asking all kinds of questions.  If it gets awkward, I honestly just let the awkwardness sit.  I'll encourage manners like you mentioned about introductions, but she's already picking that up so well I rarely have to now.  But I'm so surprised by the amount of parents who are willing to cater to their anxieties of what my opinion is, a stranger they don't have any connection to, rather than their own child!  What the f\*ck?!  I would NEVER let my worries about what other people are thinking get in front of my daughter's opportunity to learn and grow. How selfish a way to act!  I guess that's just the age we live in though. But props to you for the way you think! I completely agree."

selfimprovement,fc4hekb,t1_fc4ex4f,1577416725.0,"Great information! I especially like how you put it at the end, getting the monkey mind in line with the civilized mind. I think that’s an important distinction, aligning the two, rather than having them opposed.  You’ve given me more to think about. If I decide to have a follow up post more geared towards method rather than theory, I will make sure to review some of those ideas you mentioned. Thank you! :)"
selfimprovement,fc4ajr4,t1_fc431dp,1577411115.0,"Great point! The way I understand our brain structure is that you never really “unlearn” any behavior. The metaphor I see the most is that our brain is a huge network of roadways. You can pave your roads and add lanes, or you can let them slowly erode and wear away from not being used. But they’re still always there. So if you really reinforced a certain habit, unless you make your new healthy habit as equally reinforced, it’s easy to fall into old ways. I also think it’s not *just* time that plays a part in reinforcing behavior, or degrading it, but more so our effort on the topic over time. Like practicing a musical instrument. If you practice 10 hours a week vs 2 hours, obviously there will be a difference in skill over a period of time."
selfimprovement,fc4a47e,t1_fc41gsd,1577410772.0,You’re right! I didn’t really get into the solution side that much. Do you think it would’ve taken away from the post if I went further into detail about that?
selfimprovement,fc49wkk,t1_fc41633,1577410602.0,"I’m glad you brought this up! I actually wanted to go into further detail and mention some of this as well, however I lack the understanding of all the chemicals at the moment. I also didn’t want to lose people in the details. I really just tried to focus on the dynamic and how expansive it might be just to focus on this for self improvement. Thanks for your comment!"
selfimprovement,fc3n7k0,t1_fc3n2oo,1577393737.0,That’s the idea. Teach yourself.
selfimprovement,fc3kepf,t1_fc3j17v,1577391756.0,Ask yourself and follow your gut. Don’t rely on us. What does an amazing personality mean to you? Do what you think you need to do to attain that.
selfimprovement,fc3e8jb,t1_fc36tb4,1577387856.0,"No one else knows what it feels like to be you, except you.  So the idea of being comfortable in your own skin is basically saying don't base what you think of yourself off of what other people think of you.  Your own opinion should carry more weight. If you have a legitimate concern, do some self reflection.  How do \*you\* think you can improve?"
adderall,fc2n2et,t1_fc24ijg,1577367716.0,Do you remember where you read that? That’s an interesting theory for sure.
