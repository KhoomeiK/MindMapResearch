You can clean them up to working order pretty easily, and with a good wipe down with some sewing machine oil inside and out itll look a lot less dirty and run really well.
You can find the manual online pretty easily too.
I collect these and have gotten them for free and have paid up to $75. If it comes with the table $100 isnt /awful/  but if she really wants one, check Facebook marketplace or craigslist. They're everywhere and some people just want to get rid of them so they'll pass them on for cheap. 
But it's a good machine, it's just a straight stitch with no back stitch. I love mine!"

I like to keep track of the things I make tho, and what I bought a certain fabric for or what not."
quilting,fegz9w5,t1_fefguum,1579105828.0,oof. that's an annoying response..

Maybe a grid for planning out your own patterns?"
