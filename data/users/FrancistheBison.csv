wholesomememes,ff8uzm1,t1_ff8k4j0,1579697003.0,"I actually never got into the office, and yet the quotes are still so ingrained in the pop culture consciousness that you predict them completely. But I adore New Girl. It and Brooklyn Nine Nine came out around the same time and I saw them as the replacement for the lost NBC Thursday (office, 30 Rock, parks and rec, and community). I'm glad Brooklyn Nine Nine found its cult status but it definitely never felt like new girl got there (despite continuing for a million seasons). The character we're so hilarious and specific but not outrageous or unbelievable.

Kinda the same realm as Better Off Ted (if Better Off Ted hadn't fallen victim to the writers'  strike)"

slowcooking,ff7lwnz,t1_ff7f5hm,1579652679.0,"This is exactly my family recipe for chicken and dumplings (mom is from rural Georgia fwiw). Make broth by cooking a chicken (maybe with celery and carrots if you're fancy), remove chicken and shred meat, make the most basic dough, cut strips, boil in broth, add back chicken, end. It's legitimacy is also backed up by the fact that it's in the family church cookbook. You know, one of those flat spiral bound, 50 page affairs put together by all the wives and grandmas of the church to raise money and which also contains at least 3 jello salads."

Like Rey jumping over the ship in TROS would have been such an amazing shot had they not drilled it into our heads for a year so instead of ""oh man what is she gearing up to do here"" it became, ""oh look that ship is speeding towards them over the sand, so clearly she's gonna do that thing she did in the trailer, but I have to still sit through 30 seconds of build up""

It really makes me love movies who use scenes that are either unimportant or completely not in the film for trailers

Edit to add: one of the few exceptions here was this trailer for [Mad Max: Fury Road](https://youtu.be/hEJnMQG9ev8). I saw that, got insanely hyped by how amazing the trailer was, walked into the theater mildly concerned that it wasn't going to live up to the trailer and it somehow was everything I hoped for and more... I think I'm gonna go watch that now actually, best film of the decade"
AskReddit,fdvww5u,t1_fdvwlft,1578752606.0,Do your best to avoid it since the trailer does have some nuggets that I wish I could be surprised by

MealPrepSunday,fdlao7j,t1_fdkyef1,1578519996.0,"Fair enough, your ""body building origins"" is a good point I hadn't considered and makes more sense. Companies using it as a marketing term to the average human, who's more likely to associate ""dirty"" food with actual health violations, is a terrible choice, but the gamble paid off. I guess for restaurants, the main win is that there are no regulations on what clean food is so it's an easy way to position yourself to an increasingly health aware population. I still personally hate it as a term."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdiitah,t1_fdiicmu,1578443871.0,"Nice! I adore balsamic vinegar so sometimes I add both, but it's definitely a stronger kick of acid that way.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdfsj4j,t3_el57mp,1578369128.0,"My go to salad dressing (roughly, I don't measure anything, just keep tweaking to taste) 

- 1 part whole grain mustard like Maille
- 1 part honey
- 2 parts fresh lime juice
- 3 parts olive oil
- salt and your preferred vinegar to taste (add vinegar only if the lime isn't enough acid)

It works on pretty much any combo of ingred, compliments spicy greens like arugula, and is generally delicious.

Also butter lettuce is the most delicious lettuce, though I usually can't justify how much a single head is (it's just so good with a simple vinaigrette) so I settle for arugula/rocket and romaine"

MealPrepSunday,fdf6hc4,t1_fde2z0k,1578354413.0,"As someone from the food industry that took classes on marketing and menu design (including best practices on naming conventions), I despise the term ""clean food"" because it conjures thoughts of sanitizer and cleaning chemicals. Like, I'm glad it worked out for the industry but I still hate the term. 

Ffs vegetables are grown in the dirt and pesticide-free produce will occasionally have an insect on it so what does ""clean"" have to do with anything?

Like I get that it's supposed to mean preservative-free food, and in some cases just generally ""healthy"" food but I still will die mad at this terrible branding.

AskReddit,fdcmi1l,t1_fdcknuu,1578278590.0,"I hate beer and refuse to ""learn to like it"" (same with brown liquor but dislike of beer offends people more). Gotta love some of the condescending looks/comments I've gotten because of it, but the most memorable was the guy who learned I didn't drink beer on a second date and said something to the effect of ""we'll have to fix that"" and proceeded to take me to a bar and buy me some weird convoluted stout that came in a tulip glass. Thanks man, you've completely opened my eyes. Hops are still disgusting.

AskReddit,fdclpvy,t1_fda7zjg,1578278028.0,"Man one of the things that I love about my fiance is that he doesn't drink. He also doesn't care if I drink, so we'll go to wineries etc but there's no pressure to drink at all. I'll get a 6 pack of cider and it will last a month at least as I occasionally go through it. 

(Compared to my ex who was a burner and vaguely an alcoholic who never turned down offered drugs... God what a relief. Getting drunk takes such an effort that was not worth the return in my opinion)

So basically I drink only on my own volition which these days isn't much, and I don't feel bad for nursing the fuck out of a single drink over the course of an evening if I want to. Save a ton of money this way as well."
