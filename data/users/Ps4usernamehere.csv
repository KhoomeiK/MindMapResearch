Documentaries,ff30xyf,t1_ff30qp6,1579530740.0,Very true. Honestly being 6ft 180 is the most I've ever been and I'm trying to get it down to 170. But if have a thin type of frame and would have a huge stomach at 200 (if I gain it all goes there only)
Documentaries,ff2zl39,t1_ff2zdbj,1579529617.0,That's awesome you've made progress!

Documentaries,ff2yf2i,t1_ff2y969,1579528594.0,Depends on height. Someone at 6'3 or above could just be considered slightly overweight

And spend the majority of the time I'm not at work trying to create ideas to make more money. I wish it was relaxing. But I can see how the stereotype would fit most people."
pics,feis7i0,t1_feiq5l2,1579145864.0,This. Please do give us hope by elaborating. Some of us are struggling to pay bills working 40 hrs.

Climate change is definitely happening but I don't want you to exaggerate the numbers. I've been looking to try and find an article or anything about it reaching that temperature

RocketLeagueExchange,fcsu3yy,t1_fcsqg4q,1577925148.0,"This is absolutely true. I started playing rocket league in August 2015 I believe. The first set I collected was the Tunica set, still my favorite. I recently retired from the game mostly. However, in the beginning, the deicis weren't even wanted at all. Neither were black Tunica. Crimson cost more. This was 2016 when the crates were released. The dominus gt was the most amazing thing to hit the game, and crimson lightning wheels took over.

Back then, people loved collecting sets. Especially non crate sets. You never see that anymore. Many people collected unicorn set, chainsaw set, witch hat set, etc. Those wheels like deici, Tunica, etc were about as sought after as those sets. Seriously, people didn't really care."
