Christianity, honestly, really is only about a century removed from patriarchal, barbaric, & violent itself to only a slightly lesser extent than Islam.  

Back then, though, institutionalization of it made things seem normal.  We look at it as “a product of the times”.  People we just more brutal in general “back then”.   The religion itself held a lot of barbaric practices in place that humanity would have gladly let go of centuries earlier.  Slavery was being considered in humane as far back as pre Christian Greece.  

Modern extremist Islam is right about where Christianity was about 600 years ago.  I’d even say a tad further considering back then there weren’t “extremist” Christians & the rest were moderates.  If moderates existed they didn’t dare say anything out loud.  

We take for granted a lot of rights & comforts we wouldn’t have if people hadn’t fought against the Christian church.  Not saying everything is better for it or that Christianity itself is primarily a barbaric religion, but through the centuries that’s been how it’s been practiced & interpreted by the people implementing policies & by the majority of believers.  With inhumanity.

Islam is “over there” & not everyone can possibly be a terrorist.  It’s not fair to assume anyone is based on beliefs.  So people aren’t as likely to focus on Islam as a problem.  They don’t understand it as well.  

Christianity has the survivor effect going.  So many vocal, LOUD, proud reps of the religion are the definition of hypocritical, judgmental scum.

This kind of weird passive aggressive bs is unique to upper middle class people.  A thing is offered but it’s not polite to take the thing because you’re already ok.  It’s the thought you were willing to give the thing that counts.  You’re never supposed to accept.  But then there’s some weird unspoken rule that you wait for 3 offers & then accept reluctantly, almost by sheer force of persuasion,   

They shouldn’t have offered if they didn’t intend on forking over $500 to the locator of their lost family member.  Honestly if it were me, I’d offer that & then some.  And I’d give it without needing to be asked.  It would be in my hand ready to trade with my pet.  What’s expected should be what you get.

OP recognized immediately, though, that this reward was not forthcoming.  I’m sure he’s familiar with this particular, inane social gameplay & only called out the reward on the principal that it was offered from what it sounds like.  If you live in a “very walkable area” you have your own money.  

OP isn’t as much TA as the people who offered a reward they had no intention of paying because “who would actually expect the money to return a loved one?”.  But OP didn’t care he was in social checkmate & went with being a bit of a dick to call the family out on their bullshit.  He should just own it.  

I would’ve just gone around & written on the signs later “the reward was bullshit.  Next time Shittles gets out, leave him where you find him” The family would see it & then they have to own being dicks.

unpopularopinion,fe68sr2,t3_enu7w3,1578884293.0,"You’d have to be able to prove the victim lied first.  Second you’d have to prove the rapist would’ve had no way of knowing.  

That would be hard to go do since obviously everyone would be out to protect themselves.  Even if the victim did admit to lying they’d have to be suspicious in the eyes of a jury as covering for the rapist.  

The point of a statutory rape law is that a minor can be easily manipulated into the act of sex & doesn’t have the maturity to consent whether they falsified information or not.  But of course two 15 year olds can consent with each other.  At 16 you’re ready to go with anyone you want.  

The law thinks that extra year really makes a difference.  Even though, honestly, 16 is still a child.  17 is a child.  The age of consent seems kind of arbitrary in the same way you can be drafted into war at 18 but can’t buy alcohol til you’re 21.  

The law has the intent of protecting minors but is pretty inept at protecting people from minors.  To assume a mature looking under age child wouldn’t decide to lie to get what they want is as silly as the thought a child might actually fake an ID.  The very thought!

It’s really better said the law needs to be more nuanced.  A 19 year old & a 14 year old is technically an adult with a child.  But emotionally/mentally the 19 year old isn’t that far ahead of the 14 year old, even considering the rate of development during those 5 years.  Most modern 14 year olds act as mature as your average 30 something Harry Potter fan if not a little more.  

At some point the roles can & do reverse so there needs to be a point where when the age difference is close & the victim looks of age there can be some kind of mediation with a counselor to see how that all went down & whether it’s possible the victim might be the “victim”.  

Flat out calling it paedophilia is pretty dismissive.    It assumes we all instinctively know when people are lying or we can tell how old someone is by looking.  Minors have to be protected but in the long run it’s too binary.  No one looks at why you’re listed as a sexual offender.  It still reads like “John Wayne Gacy” to anyone who sees it.  

Some kids look much, much older.  It’s not out of the question to think 14 can pass for 16.  The 19 year old should know better to ask for ID.  But then again..if you can get a fake to get into a club..not out of the question to think you can use it for other things."

I’m gay.  I’ve experienced the persecution of the religious right in my own way & dealt with conflict my entire life because of being raised in a conservative Christian town.  I was raised non religious but then met a guy who’d been raised Pentecostal & still considered himself right with all that somehow.  

Without going into much more I considered myself Christian for a few years after I met him & about a year after we broke up I wasn’t.  I was as far from it as I could get, going in the complete opposite direction & reading anything anti Christian.  

From that perspective I can say it’s easy to get in with the wrong crowd & get into that kinda thing.  The best you can ever be for her is an anchor for sanity.  Persecution will only make her dig her heels in & hold tighter.  Cutting her off on tuition is persecution for disagreeing with you, even if her beliefs aren’t compassionate.  

You can let her know that you disagree & why.  Be patient but stern.  But cutting her off at this point is just being vindictive.  When I went through my phase with that stuff it only made it worse to have other people resist what I thought I believed.  The people who stuck by me but told me where they stood are the people who helped the most in helping myself.  

She’s going to be influenced by the people around her.  I’d say it’s good she’s willing to question things, even if it leads to a different place than you think she should end up.  If she’s really being taught how to think & not what to think she’ll eventually come to the right place in her own.  

She’ll be much more influenced by your example than by your opinions."

You had an obligation to be honest.  If he’d changed that’s something she would’ve recognized that to some degree.  

On the other side if it she had an obligation to make sure she had her facts straight before making a decision.  If she only went on what you told her that reflects something negative about her.  

It’s unlikely one conversation with a long lost daughter changed her entire course 180 degrees overnight.  I’m sure there were things she’s already experienced or she wouldn’t be reaching out.  

I’m also fairly sure she weighed what you said vs what he’s told her & himself done to see if the behaviors match up & where his side starts deteriorating.  In fact it’s very likely she spoke to him afterward to verify these things & see how many lies she’d catch him in.  He failed & she bailed.  

You weren’t the only nail in the coffin & I don’t think you were the last.  I’m sure the man in question had to have a lot to do with it to have her completely turn her plans around at the last minute."

That would include placing the computer in a common area like the living room or kitchen.  Not allowing internet access on cell phones.  Keeping the password for the computer or investing in a physical lock that prevented unauthorized access when they weren’t home.

TrueOffMyChest,fdhr2gj,t3_elam6b,1578428503.0,"I had an ex like this.  After we broke up we saw out two year leases.  He deteriorated quickly after losing his job.  He told me he wasn’t going with me to my new place when I moved.  Said he had it taken care of.  He didn’t need me.  

Guess who decided to walk off & run when it came time to go with his ride to his new situation?  The day he was to leave he had all his stuff ready.  He was almost gone.  Then he started a fight with the guy giving him a ride & took off, leaving all his stuff in the lobby of my apartment building.  

Sp I had his friend pack it up as if that was still the plan & let him take it to his new situation.  Not long after that he popped up & acted like he didn’t need help.  So I went with it.  I knew he was homeless.  But he’d done nothing to prevent it & everything to place himself in a position where I’d feel guilty & offer.  I didn’t & I felt like shit for weeks.  Couldn’t reach him.  Thought he was dead.  

Turned out he’d gotten a car.  Found a couch to stay on & made some money in that time.  But I had felt so bad when he asked for a night I said yes.  About 10 months later that night finally ended.  I got an efficiency & told him I didn’t have room.  

It’s true.   You will end up helping him til you can’t anymore.  He’s had time.  There are shelters & public assistance he can qualify for.  He’s counting on you feeling guilty.  He won’t plan or find a way for himself until he has to.   Not “you need to”.  Streets or work has to.

& I’m sorry so many people had to decide to get coffee on Christmas rather than spend time with their families & drink their coffee.  I’m also sorry they were Karens who didn’t consider that going to one of the only open coffee shops on Christmas would end up being a waste of their morning.  Seems like that would be obvious, but maybe they’re addicted to complaining to customer service.  

I celebrate (like most people now) for secular reasons but it’s still important to me & I really wanted to spend time with my family on Christmas Eve.  I had to work & I’m shocked how many people I still had to tell “hey you know we close right?” (Puzzled look from customer) “it’s Christmas Eve?” (Now we’re on the same page but they’re still not pleased).  

I’m the “assistant” manager at a popular novelty retail chain in the US.  Assistant is in quotes because I’ve actually been running it without a general manager for two months & the one that just started a week ago is pretty useless.  I wasn’t trained for either position & now I’m expected to help train the new GM.  All that with the holidays hitting—It’s been a ride.  

Since Black Friday, every day leading up to Christmas Eve has been increasing the insanity level.  In fact every day has felt exactly like you are describing.  I sympathize with you.  I’ve learned a distinct dislike for this season, holiday marketing, holiday shoppers, & shopping. 

Christmas music has just become the Pavlovian Bell of retail.  The malls flood with people that are tempted toward a myopic sense of self importance once they’re in the role of a “consumer” no matter how nice they might be otherwise.  

I’m sorry you had to deal with all that on Christmas morning.  I hope it got better once you left work."

The point of a statutory rape law is that a minor can be easily manipulated into the act of sex & doesnâ€™t have the maturity to consent whether they falsified information or not.  But of course two 15 year olds can consent with each other.  At 16 youâ€™re ready to go with anyone you want.  

The law thinks that extra year really makes a difference.  Even though, honestly, 16 is still a child.  17 is a child.  The age of consent seems kind of arbitrary in the same way you can be drafted into war at 18 but canâ€™t buy alcohol til youâ€™re 21.  

The law has the intent of protecting minors but is pretty inept at protecting people from minors.  To assume a mature looking under age child wouldnâ€™t decide to lie to get what they want is as silly as the thought a child might actually fake an ID.  The very thought!

Itâ€™s really better said the law needs to be more nuanced.  A 19 year old & a 14 year old is technically an adult with a child.  But emotionally/mentally the 19 year old isnâ€™t that far ahead of the 14 year old, even considering the rate of development during those 5 years.  Most modern 14 year olds act as mature as your average 30 something Harry Potter fan if not a little more.  

At some point the roles can & do reverse so there needs to be a point where when the age difference is close & the victim looks of age there can be some kind of mediation with a counselor to see how that all went down & whether itâ€™s possible the victim might be the â€œvictimâ€.  

Flat out calling it paedophilia is pretty dismissive.    It assumes we all instinctively know when people are lying or we can tell how old someone is by looking.  Minors have to be protected but in the long run itâ€™s too binary.  No one looks at why youâ€™re listed as a sexual offender.  It still reads like â€œJohn Wayne Gacyâ€ to anyone who sees it.  

Some kids look much, much older.  Itâ€™s not out of the question to think 14 can pass for 16.  The 19 year old should know better to ask for ID.  But then again..if you can get a fake to get into a club..not out of the question to think you can use it for other things."

Iâ€™m gay.  Iâ€™ve experienced the persecution of the religious right in my own way & dealt with conflict my entire life because of being raised in a conservative Christian town.  I was raised non religious but then met a guy whoâ€™d been raised Pentecostal & still considered himself right with all that somehow.  

Without going into much more I considered myself Christian for a few years after I met him & about a year after we broke up I wasnâ€™t.  I was as far from it as I could get, going in the complete opposite direction & reading anything anti Christian.  

From that perspective I can say itâ€™s easy to get in with the wrong crowd & get into that kinda thing.  The best you can ever be for her is an anchor for sanity.  Persecution will only make her dig her heels in & hold tighter.  Cutting her off on tuition is persecution for disagreeing with you, even if her beliefs arenâ€™t compassionate.  

You can let her know that you disagree & why.  Be patient but stern.  But cutting her off at this point is just being vindictive.  When I went through my phase with that stuff it only made it worse to have other people resist what I thought I believed.  The people who stuck by me but told me where they stood are the people who helped the most in helping myself.  

Sheâ€™s going to be influenced by the people around her.  Iâ€™d say itâ€™s good sheâ€™s willing to question things, even if it leads to a different place than you think she should end up.  If sheâ€™s really being taught how to think & not what to think sheâ€™ll eventually come to the right place in her own.  

Sheâ€™ll be much more influenced by your example than by your opinions."

You had an obligation to be honest.  If heâ€™d changed thatâ€™s something she wouldâ€™ve recognized that to some degree.  

On the other side if it she had an obligation to make sure she had her facts straight before making a decision.  If she only went on what you told her that reflects something negative about her.  

Itâ€™s unlikely one conversation with a long lost daughter changed her entire course 180 degrees overnight.  Iâ€™m sure there were things sheâ€™s already experienced or she wouldnâ€™t be reaching out.  

Iâ€™m also fairly sure she weighed what you said vs what heâ€™s told her & himself done to see if the behaviors match up & where his side starts deteriorating.  In fact itâ€™s very likely she spoke to him afterward to verify these things & see how many lies sheâ€™d catch him in.  He failed & she bailed.  

You werenâ€™t the only nail in the coffin & I donâ€™t think you were the last.  Iâ€™m sure the man in question had to have a lot to do with it to have her completely turn her plans around at the last minute."

unpopularopinion,fdk6lp0,t1_fdk5lky,1578497253.0,"The point being missed is that if you were a minor, a web blocker shouldnâ€™t have been the only line of defense.  It was up to your guardians to ensure you werenâ€™t accessing content they didnâ€™t believe was appropriate.  

That would include placing the computer in a common area like the living room or kitchen.  Not allowing internet access on cell phones.  Keeping the password for the computer or investing in a physical lock that prevented unauthorized access when they werenâ€™t home.  

Web blockers are to make parents feel better for making the least amount of effort possible.  Any less effort than that would actually be paying a subscription to a porn site & giving you the password."
TrueOffMyChest,fdhr2gj,t3_elam6b,1578428503.0,"I had an ex like this.  After we broke up we saw out two year leases.  He deteriorated quickly after losing his job.  He told me he wasnâ€™t going with me to my new place when I moved.  Said he had it taken care of.  He didnâ€™t need me.  

Guess who decided to walk off & run when it came time to go with his ride to his new situation?  The day he was to leave he had all his stuff ready.  He was almost gone.  Then he started a fight with the guy giving him a ride & took off, leaving all his stuff in the lobby of my apartment building.  

Sp I had his friend pack it up as if that was still the plan & let him take it to his new situation.  Not long after that he popped up & acted like he didnâ€™t need help.  So I went with it.  I knew he was homeless.  But heâ€™d done nothing to prevent it & everything to place himself in a position where Iâ€™d feel guilty & offer.  I didnâ€™t & I felt like shit for weeks.  Couldnâ€™t reach him.  Thought he was dead.  

Turned out heâ€™d gotten a car.  Found a couch to stay on & made some money in that time.  But I had felt so bad when he asked for a night I said yes.  About 10 months later that night finally ended.  I got an efficiency & told him I didnâ€™t have room.  

Itâ€™s true.   You will end up helping him til you canâ€™t anymore.  Heâ€™s had time.  There are shelters & public assistance he can qualify for.  Heâ€™s counting on you feeling guilty.  He wonâ€™t plan or find a way for himself until he has to.   Not â€œyou need toâ€.  Streets or work has to.

Unless theyâ€™re administering the medication or allow the cat to lick them directly after it takes it, like immediately after.  If they handle (big if) the catâ€™s feces or drink the catâ€™s urine?  Itâ€™s almost impossible to have a reaction to a trigger an entirely different being is ingesting.  

Maybe if itâ€™s crushed up & the cat is snorting it off your roommates butt there might be an issue.  Other than that it sounds more like your roommate needs some kind of validation or control which isnâ€™t your problem.

A lot of crazy can get by in a society where you have to just accept beliefs just shackled & bundled to your politics like a yoke around your neck.  The same applies to every gradation along the political scale.  

When logic fails because we have to be nice to everyone for the sake of being inclusive, weâ€™re in the same boat as tolerating creationism in public schools.  Itâ€™s the same reasoning.

Wish Iâ€™d seen this before I bought my Jeep.  I will say itâ€™s been over a year & itâ€™s still going.  Gas milage is crap.  It does a weird thing while accelerating that cost 1200 to chase & still never got fixed or even identified.  And it has a decent size oil leak.  All of that manifested almost immediately after buying the car September of 2018 after I had it to a shop to supposedly have it inspected.  They didnâ€™t charge.  I know why now.  

After a year itâ€™s still going though.  For all the problems itâ€™s actually been pretty dependable.

TrueOffMyChest,fc07mrx,t3_efcm6j,1577281987.0,"Merry Christmas.  

& Iâ€™m sorry so many people had to decide to get coffee on Christmas rather than spend time with their families & drink their coffee.  Iâ€™m also sorry they were Karens who didnâ€™t consider that going to one of the only open coffee shops on Christmas would end up being a waste of their morning.  Seems like that would be obvious, but maybe theyâ€™re addicted to complaining to customer service.  

I celebrate (like most people now) for secular reasons but itâ€™s still important to me & I really wanted to spend time with my family on Christmas Eve.  I had to work & Iâ€™m shocked how many people I still had to tell â€œhey you know we close right?â€ (Puzzled look from customer) â€œitâ€™s Christmas Eve?â€ (Now weâ€™re on the same page but theyâ€™re still not pleased).  

Iâ€™m the â€œassistantâ€ manager at a popular novelty retail chain in the US.  Assistant is in quotes because Iâ€™ve actually been running it without a general manager for two months & the one that just started a week ago is pretty useless.  I wasnâ€™t trained for either position & now Iâ€™m expected to help train the new GM.  All that with the holidays hittingâ€”Itâ€™s been a ride.  

Since Black Friday, every day leading up to Christmas Eve has been increasing the insanity level.  In fact every day has felt exactly like you are describing.  I sympathize with you.  Iâ€™ve learned a distinct dislike for this season, holiday marketing, holiday shoppers, & shopping. 

Christmas music has just become the Pavlovian Bell of retail.  The malls flood with people that are tempted toward a myopic sense of self importance once theyâ€™re in the role of a â€œconsumerâ€ no matter how nice they might be otherwise.  

Iâ€™m sorry you had to deal with all that on Christmas morning.  I hope it got better once you left work."
