vancouver,fdpdmne,t1_fdp8uqq,1578625955.0,"It takes a long time to get some sort of notoriety on instagram (and almost all other social networks) from like minded peers. You have to post the highest quality content you can for years, with occasional small bumps as you get mentioned by aggregation accounts, websites, or get featured on specific hashtags. Smart use of hashtags is important on instagram, as well as engagement. So go and like and comment (constructive comments) on other people's posts, and follow interesting ones, and the same will happen to you. Doing it with the specific goal of becoming popular is setting yourself up for failure, because it just takes so long and isn't guaranteed at all. There are just so many people posting content, that it's easy to drown in the middle without anyone noticing. So if you want to keep doing it, do it for fun and your own enjoyment. If people notice, great. If not, at least you'll enjoy yourself."

GayMen,fdilic4,t1_fdikbl2,1578445572.0,"Yeah, I'm sure it's not simple, but it's worth giving everyone a shot. I don't want society to give up on people, or make people think that some people are beyond hope. Just a few decades ago, gay people were considered beyond hope perverts that were punished/""treated""/killed/put in jail. The difference here is that gay people weren't really hurting anyone, whereas these people are. But maybe they wouldn't be hurting anyone if society had a better way of dealing with them. Again, this is an opinion. I'm not an expert. And I could be wrong. And I'm probably biased towards not putting people in jail and expecting prisons to rehabilitate people, because I was born in Europe, where that's a common sentiment."
AskReddit,fdikiae,t1_fdiiiwk,1578444935.0,"Yeah, I found it helpful when I heard it too. It helped justify to myself that distancing from my mother was okay."
GayMen,fdikdp5,t1_fdijmph,1578444856.0,"When I mentioned the parking tickets, it was to illustrate that the same ""punishment"" doesn't have the same effect on two different individuals. So giving the same punishment to everyone who raped or killed someone seems flawed to me as well. These people should be kept away from harming others again, but also educated onto ways to prevent themselves from causing such harm in the future. During that process, if experts eventually believe they seem rehabilitated, they should be let go. Which might take a few months for one person, and a few decades for another, depending on the situation. I also understand that publicly prescribing them a set number of years in prison has potential to dissuade others from following in their footsteps, which probably has merit as well."
GayMen,fdif37f,t1_fdidnj7,1578441463.0,"I think prison is necessary to keep dangerous people away from potential victims. But I think a major effort should be made to rehabilitate and reintegrate them into society. I think state mandated punishments should be as short and effective as necessary. Of course this is all complicated. You parking in a non-parking spot and getting a 200€ fine might wreck your month. But to someone with more money, it just becomes the cost of parking there. So I wouldn't consider that punishment effective."
GayMen,fdicly6,t1_fdi6h0l,1578439863.0,"That depends on whether you think jail's goal is punishment or rehabilitation. I wonder if it takes 36 years to make this guy realize raping is not okay in society, and learn to live without needing to do it anymore. I would hope much less than 36 years, but I'm an optimist, and my only psychology background was a single year class in high school"

fountainpens,fcy8um2,t3_ejimr9,1578076480.0,"Check first if it's a cleaning/grease issue. Clean it completely (with warm soapy water) until no ink color comes out. Try carefully removing the nib and feed (hold them together with a cloth, and slowly pull them straight out) and clean them as well. Push water in and out of the converter until it's clear as well. Then put everything back (the nib fits in a specific spot on the feed, otherwise it won't fit the section). Now try the pen with a reliable ink (anything from Waterman, Parker, Montblanc, Visconti, etc will do). See if it works. Usually the Visconti Van Gogh pens get dry in a few days (even if capped) since the cap is held with a magnet, and there's no thread or o-ring preventing air from getting in. After that, you can twist the converter piston until you see some ink pooling in the feed. Then twist the converter back, pulling all the ink back to the converter. This wets the feed and nib, and should help your pen write again after a few days unused. Let me know if you have some trouble, and I can make a video of me disassembling, cleaning and reassembling my Van Gogh."

vancouver,fdpdmne,t1_fdp8uqq,1578625955.0,"It takes a long time to get some sort of notoriety on instagram (and almost all other social networks) from like minded peers. You have to post the highest quality content you can for years, with occasional small bumps as you get mentioned by aggregation accounts, websites, or get featured on specific hashtags. Smart use of hashtags is important on instagram, as well as engagement. So go and like and comment (constructive comments) on other people's posts, and follow interesting ones, and the same will happen to you. Doing it with the specific goal of becoming popular is setting yourself up for failure, because it just takes so long and isn't guaranteed at all. There are just so many people posting content, that it's easy to drown in the middle without anyone noticing. So if you want to keep doing it, do it for fun and your own enjoyment. If people notice, great. If not, at least you'll enjoy yourself."

GayMen,fdilic4,t1_fdikbl2,1578445572.0,"Yeah, I'm sure it's not simple, but it's worth giving everyone a shot. I don't want society to give up on people, or make people think that some people are beyond hope. Just a few decades ago, gay people were considered beyond hope perverts that were punished/""treated""/killed/put in jail. The difference here is that gay people weren't really hurting anyone, whereas these people are. But maybe they wouldn't be hurting anyone if society had a better way of dealing with them. Again, this is an opinion. I'm not an expert. And I could be wrong. And I'm probably biased towards not putting people in jail and expecting prisons to rehabilitate people, because I was born in Europe, where that's a common sentiment."

GayMen,fdikdp5,t1_fdijmph,1578444856.0,"When I mentioned the parking tickets, it was to illustrate that the same ""punishment"" doesn't have the same effect on two different individuals. So giving the same punishment to everyone who raped or killed someone seems flawed to me as well. These people should be kept away from harming others again, but also educated onto ways to prevent themselves from causing such harm in the future. During that process, if experts eventually believe they seem rehabilitated, they should be let go. Which might take a few months for one person, and a few decades for another, depending on the situation. I also understand that publicly prescribing them a set number of years in prison has potential to dissuade others from following in their footsteps, which probably has merit as well."
GayMen,fdif37f,t1_fdidnj7,1578441463.0,"I think prison is necessary to keep dangerous people away from potential victims. But I think a major effort should be made to rehabilitate and reintegrate them into society. I think state mandated punishments should be as short and effective as necessary. Of course this is all complicated. You parking in a non-parking spot and getting a 200â‚¬ fine might wreck your month. But to someone with more money, it just becomes the cost of parking there. So I wouldn't consider that punishment effective."

fountainpens,fcy8um2,t3_ejimr9,1578076480.0,"Check first if it's a cleaning/grease issue. Clean it completely (with warm soapy water) until no ink color comes out. Try carefully removing the nib and feed (hold them together with a cloth, and slowly pull them straight out) and clean them as well. Push water in and out of the converter until it's clear as well. Then put everything back (the nib fits in a specific spot on the feed, otherwise it won't fit the section). Now try the pen with a reliable ink (anything from Waterman, Parker, Montblanc, Visconti, etc will do). See if it works. Usually the Visconti Van Gogh pens get dry in a few days (even if capped) since the cap is held with a magnet, and there's no thread or o-ring preventing air from getting in. After that, you can twist the converter piston until you see some ink pooling in the feed. Then twist the converter back, pulling all the ink back to the converter. This wets the feed and nib, and should help your pen write again after a few days unused. Let me know if you have some trouble, and I can make a video of me disassembling, cleaning and reassembling my Van Gogh."
