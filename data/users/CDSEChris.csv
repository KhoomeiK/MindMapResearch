The game is slanted heavily towards attack over defense. You and I are at about the same level, how often do you find a base that you just can't defeat? Sure, it happens, but not very often. Similarly, how many attacks against you are unsuccessful, even if you have your Blues boosted?
 
In this game, the attacker will win the majority of the time. Therefore, the argument goes that you want to optimize for attack so you can make up for what's going to be taken from you and also so you can take advantage of the events.
 
On the flip side, some argue that having the blue statues on your base serve as a deterrent because they increase the cost of an attack. The theory is that someone may be unwilling to attack you if they know they are likely to spend more money to replace the troops they'll lose.
 
That's both perspectives as I understand it. Myself, I kept blues until just recently, and even with two Master pieces I was getting successfully attacked often. I even copied some of the top bases exactly, but the attacks are still successful.
 
Of course the top bases do use blue statues. From what I understand, at a certain point you pretty much have to to keep your level up. But, it looks like it doesn't make too much of a difference till you have a substantial amount of blue statues and keep them boosted.

I think there's merit to both arguments, but I don't regret getting rid of my blue statues."

insaneparents,fcu5awm,t1_fcu4e0b,1577972904.0,"Let's break it down. 

>Who said the mom named the fish?

No one, not even me. I pointed out that it was the mom that put the fish in the tank, and suggested that OP may not have had a say in where the fish was put. And if the mother killed multiple fish already, including 4 of the father's fish, it sounds like no one but the mother makes that decision. Or do you see anything at all that implies that OP agreed to put the fish in harm's way? 

>they put the fish in the tank expecting it to be eaten

Recall that ""they"" didn't put the fish in the tank. The mother put the fish in the tank and, when she did, everyone assumed that the fish would die. It's easy for us to say that the family should have done something at that time, but we would have to ignore the hard reality of mental illness and abuse to do that without much more information. 

>they named him lunch

When? If they expected the mother to have killed another fish and it survived, why is it a problem if they gave it a darkly humorous name? 

If we're accepting OP's word, as you are, then we have to realize that the same mother that physically abused her husband, killed multiple fish, and told her daughter “who would want you? nobody would ever want you!” just might be willing to kill another fish against the wishes of her family. 

A victim of abuse has to choose their battles carefully, and there can be a terrible price to pay for embarrassing or confronting the abuser. Perhaps some would pay that price to (probably not even) save a fish, but I think it's somewhat presumptuous of us to judge OP for not being willing to pay that price every single time."
insaneparents,fcu3z9h,t1_fcu3ns9,1577971955.0,"Are you assuming that the fish was named before being put in the tank by the mother? 

If the fish survived, calling it lunch would be a form of dark humor. I'm not sure if someone would name a fish that's being fed to another fish otherwise. 

You may or may not understand how abuse can affect the victim, but the situation is pretty consistent with long-term complex post-traumatic stress disorder.

You seem to have made up your mind already, but at least recognize that there's a lot we don't know about the family dynamics and what specifically happened that day."
insaneparents,fcu3ee2,t1_fcu2nma,1577971394.0,"Do you recall that it was the mother, and not OP, that put the fish in the tank?
