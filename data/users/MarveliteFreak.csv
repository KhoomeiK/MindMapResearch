> In my spiritual awakening I came to realize how wicked it was for 2 homosexual men to adopt a male child. I was one of the lucky ones but others could've and have certainly been victims of all sorts of sick twisted things

Yes, while some children have been abused by people who adopted them, your dads never abused you, and honestly, I don’t see how this relates to the topic at hand. 

You are forcing your parents, two people who love each other very much, to sleep apart. Think of this where the rolls were reversed; you’ve been invited to your parents house, but you and your wife can’t sleep together because “heterosexuality is sinful”. You would think they’re stupid because you don’t think heterosexuality is sinful and you love your wife. That’s what they’re feeling right now. Think of them and what this is doing to your relationship with them. Think of your children, how them seeing your, uh, dysfunctional relationship with your parents will impact them and their relationship with you.

So yes, YTA"
