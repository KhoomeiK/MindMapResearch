I know someone who is managing without meds.  She is happy.

She does not work, her parents bought her a house, so she does not get evicted from her 4th apartment complex, her son is just out of high school, and wants to go to university in Canada, so she is trying to move with him. 

She cannot live a productive self supporting life.  But she is happy."
minimalism,ffhtvig,t3_et9gz7,1579953641.0,"Mine was started out of necessity. My husband was planning to move out, and I needed to downsize into a more affordable (heard as SMALLER) apartment.

As I started selling and giving away/donating items, I realized that I hadn't used them in ages.  I really did not need all my stuff.

So now I have a plastic tote that I fill with my non-essential, as I notice them, and I donate them when the bin get a full. I am on a buying freeze also, and I don't miss any of it."

TalesFromTheCustomer,ffdfbee,t1_ffcwgz8,1579819679.0,"I had an airline change my kid's flight dye to lack of seats sold on the original booking, and it was cancelled . Ok. Fine, it's later the same day. 

Then I had another agent call,  Same day,  and say the flight my kid's are on is not allowed because they are unaccompanied, and I have to pay a change fee to put them on an earlier flight... (the cancelled one).

Had to get a supervisor to notice that

1. They chose that flight,  NOT ME
2. It is allowed because it's a direct flight no layover 

45 minutes of stupid."

My girls have never been outside, so I am very careful with their diet, as they are lazy. My old man was a hunter for 8 years,  and solid as a rock. He got injured in a fight, so we had him neutered, and he stayed I doors after that.   Got fat... lol"
