He also took guardianship of a minor so he can control her until she turned 18 (and married her immediately after that), is an NRA loudmouth who publicly tried to gaslight and shame young people to enlist and declared himself a proud patriot. Ironically, he is a draft dodger, he avoided Vietnam by getting high on meth and shitting his pants on med exams so he'd get a 4F and avoid the draft.

AskReddit,ffhq5vi,t1_ffgojh8,1579947998.0,"Yes, but Japanese luxury brands were also created by their owner companies. 

Lamborghini is owned by Audi, but Lamborghini is still a completely autonomous company.

Lexus is not an autonomous company as much as it is a seperate division. Just like Infiniti, too. They were created purely for the US and American market as a seperate luxury brand because it logistically sells better. Infiniti and Lexus marquee doesn't exist in Japan because the Infiniti and Lexus models are sold under the brand badge that owns them.

For instance, the Infiniti. For the US and European market, you have Infiniti Q40, which is a regular executive sedan. But in Japan, it is sold as the Nissan Skyline. As such, Infiniti Q40 V35 and Nissan Skyline V35 are the exact same car, just with a different badge. Same thing with Lexus. In Europe and the US, you have a Lexus GS, but in Japan, it's called Toyota Aristo. 

Japanese car manufacturers created them as seperate brands for logistical reasons: they aren't needed in Japan because Japan has a very homogenic market: 90% of cars sold in Japan are domestic, with competition primarily from supercar or luxury car brands, and even then, it's primarily European brands, seen as very exotic and a select few buy them. However, in the foreign matket, Japanese cars have very much built an image of affordable, middle class economical cars, with function over form and practicality over anesthetics. Simply put, very few people would buy luxury Nissans and Toyotas because we simply don't associate them with luxury, so they created new brands and built them a luxury image, because it sells better."

Bonus story: I was driving 50 on a residential road that both went up and to the left, and the turn was smooth enough not to slow down, but the trees on the left obscured the road behind the turn. As I was approaching the turn, a car emerging from the small parking lot adjacent to the road suddenly sped up in reverse and on the road, just as I was approaching. I had to swerve hard to avoid it.

Since gas is denser than water, this was another layer of protection: even if the pressure of the depth started to crush the exterior, the gasoline would keep it in place. On both sides of the battysphere, there were two chambers filled with balast water for buoyancy. Imagine a cocoon within a cocoon, that was basically the crew chamber.

2. Casinos usually don't care when it comes to poker, as all the money in the pot comes from other players and the house takes a rake of the pot as profit, so it doesn't matter to them. However, in Blackjack, the house has to have a set amount of money on the table and as such, they lose money directly when advantage players clear them out using card betting.

Advantage play through card counting is not illegal by law, and as such, while casinos do ban advantage players, they cannot be criminally charged for it.

MurderedByWords,fe4hjxp,t1_fe44yuu,1578859391.0,"Let me attest to that situation.

I was an unpopular kid in high school. I was weird, withdrawn and an easy target.

Throughout my teenage years, I didn't get much attention or validation from people. I truly saw myself as a victim of selfish behavior and that I was the odd one out. I did have a gf when I was 15/16, and I lost my virginity to her, but I was inexperienced and went classic Schmosby and she dumped me soon enough. In retrospect, I went full nice guy and I became too emotionally codependent, so she took an escape route quickly before the relationship progressed too much deep. I didn't have another relationship until I was 18/19.

When you spend so much time being mocked, ridiculed and generally shunned, you start to develop a certain mindset of a victim, instead of trying to analyze yourself as a person. You chalk it up to kids being shitty.

Looking back, I was a narcisstic asshole with no social standing to mask it as a charismatic person. I was also caught screenshoting pics of popular girls on Instagram and it turned me into a pariah.

Now, at 22, I realize that it's much further than simply black or white. I was heavily picked on, but at the same time, I had a raunchy, fedora kid behavior that justified other people's behavior back then. Not to mention, I was a hormonal teen and I couldn't understand why I was not attractive to women. I chalked it up to my looks (pimples) but in reality it was lack of style, bad appearance and lack of social graces.

If I was on Reddit back then, and if I found incel subreddits, I would definetly swallow that black pill. Those are people who more or less went through the same experiences as I did, and fell into a mindset of a victim of a society being unfair to them, instead of trying to self reflect.

I am no longer that person, but I can understand how easy is fall into that echo chamber. When you feel the way that I felt, back then, it is easy to feel validated, it's easy to fall under that spell. Who wouldn't want to hear that they are the victim, and that they are the enemy? We are a tribalistic species seeking to belong somewhere. And they feel that they belong in that community. They invest themselves there because it's easier to accept a reality where you are a victim, rather than reflecting on yourself and accepting that it's also your fault.

This is why they reject our advice and our help. They don't want that help. They *think* that they do, but deep down, they know that there is something wrong with them, and they are afraid that, all these time, the fault lies with them.

And, when I focused on myself, when I focused on changing myself, when I focused on realizing who I was, and who I want to be, I realized just how much of a shitty person I was. I realized that my hatred of society was jealousy of not being a part of one.

I do not condone and I will never condone their behavior, but there will always be a small part of me who feels sadness for them, because I was on that road, and I know that I would go down that road if I found out who they were, and joined up.

That is why they are who they are."

The rest of the Enclave forces migrated to the East towards Capital Wasteland to flee the remaining forces of New California Republic, arriving in Capital Wasteland. 35 years later, they were finally destroyed in a war against the Brotherhood of Steel. 

* On account of several Canon and non Canon sources, Enclave forces survived in smaller numbers. While Autumn Senior ordered that the major part of Enclave move east towards Washington D.C, a smaller unit remained in Navarro, led by Mark Gannon. Shortly after Autumn Senior left, NCR assaulted Navarro, crippling the rest of the Enclave forces there, but a pocketful of survivors fled to Mojave and they settled in Novac.

* There is no mention of any of the Enclave renmants on the East Coast. Most likely, rest of the Enclave forces were hunted by the Brotherhood and killed. However, a single member is known to be alive: years before the Enclave was defeated by the BoS, a scavenger unit was sent to Boston, but all died. One member survived, and decided to stay.

Ir became more of overly pandering stereotypes about men in general rather rhan anything else. I lurked a bit and they had a post where someone on Reddit criticized them (tbf, it was simply ""Thjs sub is shit"" type of comment), but dear Lord did they all circle jerk on that post and immediately branded the user as a sexist male without proof.

The most shameless, disgraceful man to ever exist in the British media. He makes Piers Morgan seem like fucking Mary Poppins. Disgusting cunt.

His Sun coverage is just top of the shitstained iceberg. He took over a low budget channel for young adults called LIVE TV, forced Janet Street-Porter out from the channel (and then offered to have sex with her if she paid him £5 million, the figure was his calculation on how much money he'd lose in ad revenue and future ventures), and filled the channel with topless chicks throwing darts, dwarves on trampolines stating weather, and a girl named Tiffany who stripped to her undies while reading stock market reports. He also had the audacity to claim it was a milestone.

He's also a staunch Tory, proclaimed Margaret Thatcher to be the greatest PM in history, and has also heavily smeared Scotland (despite being Scottish by descent)."
AskReddit,fdjzpnu,t1_fdhtdm5,1578492386.0,"Smurfing is a tactic used by experienced players who usually have high level accounts and have a great amount of experience in the game.

They deliberately then create new accounts, and since they are lvl 1, are paired with other lvl 1 players who are usually new players and therefore inexperienced, and with that, they score easy victories against them due to superior knowledge and experience.

It's very much a dick move, and smurfs can be recognized by throwing profanities and insults by claiming that the game is easy and that their teammates/opponentes are noobs - but never mention that they are actually smurfing.

Many MOBAs and other MMORPGs implemented safety measures against smurfers by creating jail servers where they have to fight other smurfs."

He also regretted not killing the SS. Since his wife and daughter were murdered, he himself stared that he understood that revenge. He placated himself by thinking that there was no way that the SS would ever be freed from his pod, let alone find him and kill him. Still, he regretted it.

Towards his end, though, he realized that he would have to duel with the SS. He understood it as soon as Shaun sent him to live in Diamond City with the child synth Shaun. Right then, he knew that he was bait. He was sent to Fort Hagen and given a supply of Gen 1s and 2s as cannon fodder, but he never took the trip, needing to recuperate. However, just then, Shaun awoke SS in order to find him.

I think I wouldn't be surprised if Shaun deliberately told Kellogg to standby in Fort Hagen so that SS could find him. When Virgil fled towards the Glowing Sea, Shaun most likely considered him alive. As such, Shaun most likely also kept Kellogg at Fort Hagen to spare Virgil's life so that SS could also find him, and interrogate him in order to gain access to the Institute."
falloutlore,fdjnjr0,t3_ekdw0d,1578479566.0,"1.) Most of the NCR troops in the Mojave are conscripts, with barely any basic training or combat experience. Not to mention, most of the conscripts are from the inner regions of California, and as such, have no real experience in battle or how the real Wasteland is, since California is relatively peaceful and with few real threats.

2.) 

a) NCR leadership is hilariously incompetent. The current President is Aaron Kimball. He was a great military commander, but a shitty leader. He poured all his interests and goals to expand towards Mojave, even though the NCR lacks the resources, supply lines and the tech to reliably hold and secure the frontier borders of the Republic. He is also overconfident in his abilities because the NCR army had no real threat or opposition in advancement towards Mojave until they met the Legion. He's the main reason why the NCR is failing. 

b) Second main reason? General Lee Oliver, the very definition of a patsy and a crony. He's a complete, utter idiot who daydreams of being a war hero with all the badges, honors, medals and being carried on a throne in The Hub as a legend. He is known as ""General Wait-And-See"" amongst the lower ranks and grunts of the NCR army because he's a reactive commander: doing apsolutely nothing to try to gain any strategic and military advantage over the Legion, instead, just twiddling his thumbs and demanding a flow of conscripts to be sent to the Dam because he envisions himself gloriously decimating the Legion in the Second Battle of Hoover Dam. He also caused unforseen consequences; he hates Chief Hanlon, because of his furious envy because of Chief Hanlon's strategic efforts winning the First Battle of Hoover Dam. He feels that Hanlon robbed him of the glory he felt obligated to recieve (despite the fact that he did nothing to warrant victory). He was so spiteful that he sent most of the NCR Rangers to Baja to combat the ghoul problem there, robbing the Mojave front of competent soldiers who are much more useful here, and relying on conscripts. 


3.) Unlike the NCR, Legion didn't twiddle its thumbs during the 4 years between the First Battle and the time of FNV. They learned from their mistakes and realized that subrefuge, sabotage and clandestine work will be the key in defeating the NCR. As such, they did everything to undermine the NCR: They made allies with the Fiends and the Great Khans, and use them to attack caravans, cutting off supply lines, while simultaneously allowing caravns to freely travel through Legion territory in a massive false flag operation to pin the loss of caravans on poor management of NCR protection. They also planted spies in many factions across the Mojave, and brokered a deal with the Omertas to have a strategic New Vegas ally. They also sabotaged many NCR installations in the Mojave.

Overall, NCR could defeat the Legion way back during the First Battle. Hanlon repeatedly demanded the NCR military to advance towards Legion territory as soon as they defeated the majority of the forces on Hoover Dam, and they could have done it, but they instead decided to wait and they fucked themselves over."

First, Chinese military scientists developed the Hei Gui stealth suits, which were highly efficient and used in infiltration missions across the United States.

Power Armor was not exactly a response, but it was developed as a efficient exoskeleton and a combat suit developed to protect infantry units. It was used at Anchorage, and then to invade the Chinese mainland. The main reason why it was developed is, numerically, China had a much larger supply of troops than the US did. Currently, as of 2017, the population of the US is 327 million, and population of China is 1 .385 billion. That allows them for a much bigger number of troops, especially in the mainland, and US  military cannot send all the troops there, and, as such, Power Armor is a great advantage to the US troops.

Stealth Boy was a direct answer to the stealth suits.

As for Chinese power armor, even if they managed to develop some of their own, they are years behind what the US military has in store. At the very best, perhaps they managed to acquire a T-45 and reverse engineer it, but they either lacked the time and resources to implement it in their own army, or the design was too faulty and rudimentary to be efficient. Also, what can a rudimentary Chinese knockoff T-45 do in a fight against a real T-45? Hell, not to mention a T-51 or a T-60?"

europe,fdhv94o,t1_fdhglh3,1578430761.0,"That is the justification of them openly attacking them out of sheer hatred. This is more of a satirization of open stereotypes. As the person above said, no race, religion, culture and nationality is justified to be above any kind of humor targeting it, by anyone.

We make fun of every nationality, religion and race. There is no justification of killing people on the sake of being offended by a satirical magazine that made fun of other religions as well. Charlie Hebdo made fun of Christians and Hebrews too, but you don't see them blowing up and killing journalists.

It's q very complicated, nuanced issue, but their attack can never be justified or excused in any way. By doing so, you're allowing these people to be above any criticism and attempt of humor. And that should never be allowed. Their mission was to send a message that nobody is allowed to speak negatively of Islam in any way. That's a murder of free speech. Nazis targeted everyone in Germany who opposed them, ws condemn fhem, why not condemn the people who killed those journalists?

Let's face it, House is a sardonic, stubborn, curmudgeonly asshole. While his perpetual miserable existence exists partially due to his leg, he is still an asshole in general.

However, nobody can deny how goddamn effective he is. He's one of the most effective doctors that there is, because he never gives up on a patient. He treats them miserably, but what makes it so effectively is the same how Wilson described him. He doesn't have a need to save a person, he has a need to solve the puzzle. To him, it's not about being a hero, saving people, etc. It's about solving the puzzle. He can be humane and kind to people when the situation arises, but first and foremost, he is only interested in how, where and why.

And, frankly, it's a realistic view that works well. The reason why he clashes with the others so much is that so many other doctors under his wing are focused on the wellbeing of their patients, while he only cares about getting them cured. Others see House as a sociopath with no empathy towards his patients, House sees them as idealistic idiots who cannot accept the reality of how much a stressed, miserable, thankless job they are doing, and how pointless it is to show affection.

The whole time, House is trying to teach them that they cannot bring any emotions to the workplace, that you cannot hesitate or show extended empathy. He sees it as a general weakness that disallows them from taking risks and giving fresh perspectives. This is best seen with Thirteen, when revealed that she suffers from Huntington's disease, House offered to kill her when the time was right, and he could do it without blinking an eye because to him, it's how to solve that puzzle. 

The reason why he is on good terms with Wilson ia is that Wilson acknowledges House for who he is and is able to respect him for his methods. Even though he drives him crazy, he understands that Wilson is more perceptive about him than other people, and that Wilson is unafraid to stand up to him.

The show was more about other people around House, rather than House."
