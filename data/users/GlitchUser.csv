However, I have had a couple of medications that I am deathly allergic to. Seizures and dyskinesia are an entirely different matter.

Always check with your prescriber. Even if it's just for piece of mind."

First, *be kind to yourself.* 

It's a struggle. Those voices are not correct. They are difficult to ignore, nonetheless. I completely understand. 

Perhaps the academic success was never the real issue. I can't answer that for you. Meditation has helped me to find a more relaxed mental state that permits underlying issues to surface. It might work for you. 

Second, *be kind to yourself.*

We can place so much importance on worldy aspirations that we ignore ourselves in the process. Self-care is my major problem. I would never ask or expect a friend or loved one to resign themselves to misery in pursuit of any goal. However, I do it to myself constantly. 

My doctors have recommended hobbies outside of my academic/professional work, as well as time in a natural setting. Perhaps that may help, as well.

Best of luck, and congratulations on whatever victories you have, be they exterior or interior."

mentalhealth,fespk1p,t3_eqifmu,1579367664.0,"Great question. 

I've found that those who have experienced problems with their mental health to be more understanding. 

While it might not be the best analogy, it is reminiscent of those who were born into wealth not comprehending poverty. 

Frankly, it is easier to believe that the situation is a deserved one and due to a series of poor choices than to extrapolate the myriad of contributing factors in the end result. 

We, as humans, are designed to be efficient and simplification is one method to achieve this efficiency."

*Be kind to yourself.*

When I have episodes, I cannot function anywhere near the level that I do normally. 

I am currently in engineering school. My mental health has taken my GPA from 3.9 one semester to 1.6 another semester. The self-flagellation is horrible and results in extreme clinical depression. I stop eating and drinking. I stop showering or brushing my teeth. I have had to repeat simple classes several times over.

There are times I truly do not want to live my life, which results in a shame spiral when I consider my family. 

Medication and therapy have kept me alive. Sometimes that's enough. Sometimes that's all I have. 

Please, be kind to yourself."
