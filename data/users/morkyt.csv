AskReddit,fekcuge,t3_epmr38,1579197379.0,"I'm a teacher in the UK.

In my opinion the problems are multiple.

-Our current government doesn't prioritise funding education, therefore schools are hugely underfunded.

-class sizes in many schools are higher than 30 pupils, meaning teachers can't be as impactful on a 1:1 level with pupils. 

-many teachers are leaving the profession due to huge emphasis on inspections by OFSTED and the stresses that come along with that. 

-imo, behaviour of pupils is declining. Many getting excluded from school due to disengagement and poor behaviour which causes stress for all in the classroom. 

-the education system in the UK doesn't give out many permanent contracts in this day and age to teaching staff, due to funding. This, once again causes teachers to leave the profession.

Edit: I just read this is for a research project. I'm happy to talk more about this if you'd like? I can give the perspective of a teacher if it'd help."
