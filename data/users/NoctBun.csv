My brothers, however, flinch whenever he comes near even though I tell them he's not doing to do anything to them unless they cause him to and have told beforehand if he does nip ( which he does for attention ), squeal like he hurt them.

dogs,fee0xn4,t3_eomrod,1579024093.0,"I've seen the whole ""I don't want a puppy yet my wife gets a puppy and we drag the puppy into our arguments while blaming everything on the puppy,"" and it's no wonder a dog would have problems when there is no collective work or shared responsibility of the animal and instead feeding off of the negative emotions it's causing. COMMUNICATION. If someone doesn't want a dog and has been very firm about it, DO NOT GET A DOG THINKING THEY'LL CHANGE THEIR MINDS. It's a 50/50 chance someone will end up changing their input on the dog, or they're liable to neglect or abuse the dog -- one of my neighbour's dad tried to kill one of their dogs because he didn't want to take care for him anymore, or so was the impression, it happened years ago and believed that's what they said. Luckily he was still alive but he was shot(?), survived that and then he tried to bury him alive. Some people straight up won't feed it because they don't see it as ""their"" dog when the other person is the one who brought it in, hence thinking it's their sole responsibility to take care of it -- this is by the lack of communication, have it bringing in a puppy in the house of a non-dog person or if you already have enough dogs and the one who's acting as the voice of reason stating you cannot manage another dog, others won't bother training a new dog on the same belief and act shocked when the dog develops actual problematic behaviours.   


Shelters often write down prior living situations as to what is ideal for them and what's not, they'll say if they're good with kids or other animals, they'll note down their phobias -- basically to give you an idea of what to expect of that particular dog. I've also seen one very anxious dog be returned to the shelter at least two times, probably because they couldn't manage how nervous he was or had a bad case of separation anxiety. AKC also gives you an idea of what each dog's temperament and ideal living situation, if you're looking for dogs that are good around kids -- this is to not say as a default, if a kid is treating it poorly, it may not enjoy being around kids -- if it's lax, not all energetic but still need to be taken out on walks in order to keep it stimulated, look for lap dogs. Even if you like / love a particular breed, you need to ensure you have the right environment for that dog, for instance I love huskies and german shepherds, however can't because not only are we in a non-friendly household ( meaning pets aren't readily welcomed without a deposit that some can't afford especially with an already costly rent ), and that I have a rabbit -- I'd rather prefer to avoid high-prey drive dogs in regards to my rabbits safety. But, there's the matter of training them as puppies so they don't have that urge while growing up. Point being as mentioned, make sure you're fit to take care of a dog ( importantly those who require certain elements ) and those who you live with also want to care for a dog."

I've been dragged in the middle of fights of people around me who are relationships, suffered the aftermath, and developed a fear of getting yelled at from childhood, my anxiety flares if anyone sounds remotely angry, doesn't matter if I didn't do anything to warrant it -- and just hate confrontation, and doubt that's anything worthwhile to have in a relationship.

I've been told by some, ""if you can write a paragraph about your depression, then you aren't really depressed,"" or, ""you have nothing to be depressed about,"" and various other indications that one suffering from depression or is feeling suicidal is attention seeking, yet those who openly post probable methods to kill themselves are given more attention -- I'm not to say either side is bad, but it just seems that is what the stigma somewhat originates from, I would typically roll my eyes at posts that revolve around suicide awareness when reality, no one really does much for those who are silent about it or post about it in moderation in fear that people are going to attack them or accuse them for attention seeking, being forced to keep quiet about it for those reasons exactly; like they're being selfish feeling that way or they're not allowed to feel that way and instead pretend to be happy while in truth they would rather not be here.   


I'd see some of my friends on FB saying they feel suicidal and people react negatively about it like they're not allowed to express how they're feeling and it just -- pisses me off, comments like ""I hate when you post shit like this."" People especially need to stop answering in this manner, as this is what leads those suffering from the symptoms to bottle it up -- I do it because again, I rarely have anyone to talk about it, even with a therapist, it's hard to address it as I broke down when I told my dad if I was thinking about ending my life before it got properly assessed, or I forget the last time I felt suicidal or it's because I talked about it to a texting crisis service, but doesn't fully make the feeling go away. The thing being I would, indeed, think about it, even the methods but would always be too scared to commit to it, even if it seems like everything could be better for me. Really, it's more selfish to keep having someone remain in a situation that's painful for them to the point they feel like suicide it the answer and do little to help or remedy it. I still hang on, surprisingly, due to being told to at least live for my pets, right now I have a rabbit -- and frankly I can't bear to give him up simply because I'm planning to end my life as that would bring suspicion onto me, I was already depressed enough when my first rabbit passed away and felt like wanting to be with her as I couldn't stand not having her around anymore.

The important thing is to take mind to body language, here, dogs who enjoy or are wanting to play:  
\- play bows.  


\- wiggly, as you'd see in happy dogs, they're loose and wiggly, especially when they're wagging their tails to people or other dogs they like to play with, even their rears shake along with their tails.  


\- they take turns.- loud, continuous snarling that's exaggerated. play-growing is less scarier sounding than actual threatening snarling / growling.  


\- either dog voluntarily flops on their back, becoming vulnerable by ""falling down,"" this is where taking turns also comes into play to pretend or act like the other dog caught them.  


\- chasing  


\- coming back for more; it's the same in determining whether a dog tolerates an action or actually loves it, dogs who tolerate something may not eagerly come back as they're not sure, as opposed to a dog who will immediately come over after seeing you or the gesture with is associated with a pleasure; petting is one prime example.

dogs who are exhibiting aggressive behaviour:  


\- hackles are raised, you can see this at the base of their necks and at the base of their tail bone. of course, hackles being raised does not always mean aggression, it can be overstimulation.  


\- their bodies get stiff.  


\- curled lip mouths are closed with low-growling can be heard, this is a difference from open mouth panting where stress levels can be assessed here too, loose tongue ( like tail ) is the dog being stress-free and happy, slightly tighter tongues may be a bit on edge / stressed.  


\- swift movements, there is no taking turns. there's also no bouncing around.  


\- ears are pinned back, curled lip and snarling. you can even determine if the muzzle and forehead appear tensed.  


\- in the event of an actual fight, you would one; hear yelping, dogs learn in their puppy years to not hurt other dogs while play if it isn't in ill-will, hearing a puppy yelp is a direct sign they're hurting them. a dog getting into a fight with another doesn't care about this and the ""loser"" will leave the area and even be afraid of the dog it got into a scuffle with.  


\- body language also pertains to the tail, a scared, less confident dog will tuck their tail between their legs to express this fear, however may be impossible to determine such with dogs with naturally short / stump tails or docked tails. another sign is to look for trembling or whale eyes, and even perhaps hiding behind you or other relative ""safe zones.""  


\- the dog will not want to come back for more if it was in a fight with the other, this is an addition to the dog being afraid, they'll want to avoid the source.

So, from what you explained, they're more playing too rough and should continue to monitor and as suggested, step in if you feel like it's getting too much but don't scold them for it otherwise they may believe play is wrong, if they're playing roughly or wildly, they may not get as much stimulation to release all that energy and instead have it only to project.

I don't know precisely of the success rate of if it's been overly used by other owners with the similar problem, but am looking for ways to get him to stop dominating the toy rabbit ( so far, I take it away immediately when he humps, not when he's grooming it. ) Overall, yes -- looking at the guide, I'll wait until I move out as currently, per ""sharing"" a room with a roommate, there's not much open space to put in another equally sized pen like his, let alone together. I'm also looking to allow him to be free-roamed once I do, would it have to wait until they're bonded as I don't want to make the other rabbit feel left out?"
Rabbits,fdalez1,t1_fdabdvi,1578247401.0,"Currently I do have a job, hence the statement as of late/now, I take care of most of his essentials, before when I stated my parents provided hay was during both when I couldn't legally get a job and was struggling to get a job after I was laid off from my previous before my new one. As of right now, I can afford another, it's just house circumstances or by how my parents say ""we"" can't manage another.

He is fixed, he has been for at least 1 or 2 years. We had done so exactly for the hormonal problems. I'm aware bonding will not be perfect the first time around, his pen is spacious enough that I could separate them  and keep them from potentially jumping over the pen, or sectioned off area, to get to the other, but let them sniff each other or perhaps wait until I move out as the territory will be unfamiliar to both -- although unsure how the process would go; do I leave him at the new territory first to get him a bit situated and then pick up the other or while on the move I pick up the other while he's still in the car on the way to the new house, whenever that happens? Unfortunately, I can't go to a rescue as the one in my state that specializes in rabbits is miles and miles away and I live nowhere close to it, unless I could attempt to see if the ones who foster particular rabbits is opening to see, the nearest rescue where I used to volunteer takes in rabbits as well, but don't think they offer that nor have been taking any in for a while."

Vent,fd5zs7p,t1_fd5ma72,1578183569.0,Unsure if that applies to the DMV when you're attempting the written / knowledge test as I don't think they qualify to be considered a school.
Vent,fcz0y49,t3_ejly1z,1578091469.0,"This is exactly why I hate public schools, no one considers other people wanting to go home as soon as school's over and not have to spend 10 or more minutes until a social group finally dissipates or have the brains to go, ""oh! we should not be in other people's way!"" to be able to get through. It doesn't help the shy or typically quiet when they're trying to get through because their voices get drowned out by the growing chatter as they suffer twice as much. Also when it comes to the difficulty of getting to classes on time, you have everyone coming out at the same time, it's crowded, people with seemingly more time than others because their next class may be one or two doors right/left of the room they were just in, hang around and flock together, it's garbage teachers force responsibility on a tardy that wasn't remotely your fault."

Despite being ""at your own pace,"" they don't really give much options for those with anxiety or memory problems aside from recommending that you attend webinars, find others of the same study ( which I'm currently in, but don't really reach out to unless it's something to get off my chest, an issue I'm suffering, or adding in to something I've already tackled. ) I'm frankly surprised I managed to get this far, I've never been good with tests, I usually just guess, difference being it's a subject I'm savvy at and know the answers, and hope it's right or the majority of it is a passing grade overall. I'm trying for a clinic, but they just seem to just ignore me, at least one that had a position I was looking for and was recommended to start at, since then, rarely anywhere else houses the similar within easy distance, at best I work at a doggy daycare but I'm getting the short end of the stick there too.

I may be close to getting to the air garden, or perhaps soon enough after I find Mist Ocean and get the final ability. So far Lagoon is pretty much the area where I've stacked up more points because of either the depth it takes or it just doubles the value for those items."
FinalFantasy,fcwn53g,t1_fcvou1g,1578030389.0,"That was the main con at first until I got around to digging regardless, evolving him and leveling up his beak from that moment onwards. After getting his ocean ability and leveling him up, I will admit it is a bit easier as I've had some lucky rounds of getting a Chocograph or two per run, or one after the last. The best I've managed from Lagoon was maybe 8, that being my high score. As of now, I might be missing Mist Ocean, other than that, I'm caught up on everything that is available to the current upgrades / locations and what I can track and dig up in the over world."
Vent,fcwmxsv,t1_fcwcpft,1578030204.0,"To be honest, I want to, too, in order to achieve a better life for my rabbit who's the world to me. But -- for the past, if not more, years had made me feel like it's not possible or I did something in a past life to be this miserable with no progress in getting out. In terms of cool facts, there's a lot to mention; ruminants / herbivores, or cows, have more chambers in the stomach than carnivores do. Learned about dental formulas, at least most of the exotics have 20 or more teeth in total -- guinea pigs, ferrets may be another -- I'll have to review one of the books where I wrote down the equations -- etc. In terms of learning more about my animals, such as my rabbit as mentioned, rabbits have grainy vision and don't really rely on sight to recognize a person, they instead rely on sound ( the person's voice ), and smell. Leaning more about certain conditions breeds of dogs are prone to, such as shar-peis, chow-chows, pugs, bulldogs -- basically any breed that has rolly or wrinkly skin are prone to entropion, which is the rolling of the eyelids and the lashes scratch the corneas, causing irritation. There was another condition similar to that but was named different and had a different effect, but caused by the same attributes to the dog."

FinalFantasy,fcuu2wp,t1_fctjqpy,1577988512.0,"Yeah -- I figured since he was doing at least 11 damage during two level ups at his light blue evolution, which doesn't help as many items are 65-80 in depth with 30 seconds.

Vent,fctf6ar,t3_eismpa,1577941308.0,"I'd say leave him, this is nowhere a healthy relationship ( especially the controlling, anger section, I personally know this per my dad who was the like towards both me and my mom and I've developed a fear / bad anxiety of anyone sounding mad or acting angry towards me ) and it's no surprise you're unhappy, staring over doesn't exactly seem so bad -- at least, if you're feeling up to it, in this context it appears unfair to you, you're willing to hash out the responsibility of taking care of kids, animals or children, but he doesn't. Granted you respect his decision of disagreeing and not, instead going out and getting an animal nevertheless -- seeing how that often brings a bigger strain in the relationship such as neglecting the animal/child or dropping the responsibility solely onto you. Rare chances he'll see he was wrong and actually love the item you are to care for together.   


Have you tried looking for wanted positions of jobs you've been wanting to work at? Is there anything that can be introduced to give it that challenging feel? In terms of being able to have enough resources to supply yourself, I'd also say try to linger with that job a bit more until you get accepted for the ones that bring on a more engaging sense and then you can choose whether or not to keep both or abandon the boring one and go straight first for the one you enjoy -- as  for location, you could also look f or jobs that are located elsewhere in areas you fit in. Frankly for the most part, I feel you -- 21 or less years being an mentally toxic household, at least, while I'm in the same space as my ""sibling/roommate,"" I've been trying to work on getting my own independent life where I'd be happier, but so far, no luck.  


The point being if you really want something to look forward in your future, provided it's going to take time, go for the things that genuinely make you feel happy and actually enjoy."

Kept talking about wanting to go/be buff with me under the sheets, which I repetitively stated I wasn't comfortable with. We ""compromised"" that he would be while I get to wear pants or whatever, still not 100 down but was reasonable to say ""as long as you agreed with it.""
