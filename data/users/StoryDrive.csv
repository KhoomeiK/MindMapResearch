As the one who's good at math, I'd help my boyfriend with his homework too. I took tae kwon do for years, and I helped a lot with teaching the lower belts once I got some experience. My mom is a fitness instructor, and she got me certified in a couple things so I could help out. For three summers, I taught video game programming at an arts camp. In between those summers, I was a teaching assistant at college. 

I thought I was going to lose my fucking mind by the time I graduated. There's only so many ways I can explain one thing to so many people, or one thing many different ways to the same person. I had the patience to get through each day but by the time I got home I'd want to punch someone.

GenderCynical,ff922jt,t3_es8snq,1579702921.0,"It's a fucking venn diagram. Plenty of kids like stuff that aligns with their AGAB, and plenty don't. Some are trans, some aren't. Kids who start out GNC may be more likely to be trans, but it's not a definite ""whoops, my daughter likes hot wheels, guess she's actually a boy."" 

It's frustrating, because a lot of the time it's the easiest way to try and explain being trans to cis people; there are so many stories of trans women who wanted to play with dolls and wear dresses when they were little. But it's not the only narrative, even though people on both sides can cause harm by assuming it is; TERFs go off in the same vein as the lady in this post, people questioning their gender assume ""well, if I don't fit this specific narrative, then I must not be trans,"" and sometimes nuance just gets thrown out the window. 

No one is forcing kids to transition. I fucking WISH someone had suggested to me that I could be trans when I was younger, maybe then it wouldn't have taken until I was twenty fucking four to realize, hey, maybe I should actually consider the idea that I might be trans instead of brushing it off because my experience didn't fit some arbitrary checklist.

I don't know why this is the TERF argument that gets me so angry, but it is. Rant over."

malefashionadvice,ff72jto,t3_eruuja,1579639837.0,"I hope this goes over well here, but for me it's because, once I realized that I'm a trans guy, and that there were, in fact, clothes I could put on that made me happy when I looked in the mirror, I started giving a shit for the first time in 24 years. 

I spent my whole damn life wearing t-shirts and sweats because I didn't care what I looked like. Wearing anything that looked *nice* generally meant wearing something feminine, which made me feel panicky and anxious for reasons i couldn't understand, so I stuck to shapeless, unisex clothing, and dragged my feet through dressing up for any kind of event. If I liked a shirt it wasn't because it looked good on me, it was because it had my favorite pokÃ©mon on it. 

Now I'm a grown-ass adult who works in an office setting and I feel like I'm playing catch up, figuring out what most guys my age would already know regarding professional clothing. I wouldn't say that I dress that nice, but I lurk here because I want to learn more, look better, be the person I want to be. I'm making do with slacks from target and button-up shirts from thrift stores for now, but one day I'll have the money and knowledge for a proper wardrobe."

LateStageCapitalism,ff3q572,t1_ff3nycf,1579546451.0,"The problem is that a lot of people don't have the option to drastically change their buying habits. So many people are just trying to get by, buying whatever's cheapest and meets their needs, because they don't have the time or money to find less harmful alternatives. Huge portions of the world's population live in areas without adequate public transit, and with facilities too far apart for biking or walking to be an option, or maybe they have a disability or illness that keeps them from being so active. Whatever they buy or do is determined by what's available in the area, and they probably don't have the means to leave the area, especially if this is where all their friends and family are. 

And as far as voting habits, people who care about the environment are already voting for people who pledge to help the environment. The people who don't care have been convinced by those already in power to keep voting for them and vote in opposition to any regulation or meaningful change. 

Why must it be the responsibility of a single mom making minimum wage in a rural town to spend her valuable time biking for hours to the nearest organic market to get groceries, instead of the politicians and CEO's who actually have the power to give the common people more options to make good choices for our society and environment?"
