depression,ff6ub6v,t3_erqjbv,1579635034.0,I think you care mostly about the third thing the most which is why you put it last but I feel exactly the same. It's not weird to be wanted or desired to live for attention. Most people want attention especially if they're not getting enough of it and I feel the same because the attention recieved isn't genuine or doesn't feel genuine enough. Attention is something we crave at humans. It's pretty normal to have a fantasy to be sick in order to get attention that you believe you deserve.
depression,fet3a73,t3_eqcju4,1579371388.0,"Honestly, I don't think anyone understands me at all. No matter how hard anyone has tried has just ended up either feeling hopeless with trying or they just leave. I feel like I'm going to die alone because of it; it's been a solidified fact in my mind for a while now. (And take a guess at what my worst fear is) 
Although, I have found that telling someone ""close"" to me that something they said hurt me just makes them think back and if they call you weak or something, it just shows their emotional maturity is terrible and that they obviously are just clueless. It's taken years for my parents to slightly understamd by just respecting that I'm either not emotionally feeling well from me telling them upfront and also apologizing after it comes out or preemptively. 
Just speaking my mind 'cause I definitely understand the pain of not being heard or understood."
depression,fcmte58,t1_fcmsz5w,1577791352.0,"What do you do or where do you go to meet people? I dropped out of college recently due to psychiatric reasons involving stress, anxiety, and clinical depression. I find it difficult to find the motivation to broaden my spectrum of people mostly because I don't even know where to start. I guess this is a broad question but where should I go? What can I do to motivate/encourage myself that I have the possibility of meeting anyone that I click with?"
depression,fcmsg3v,t1_fcmqyrl,1577790011.0,"I seek both. I seek a relationship in which I feel which I am deserved and treated like a true friend, yet I can't find that true feeling of friendship. I try to find my ""clique"" or ""group"" of people that would be able to at least sympathize what I'm going through, but I can't find that group or person. I feel like it's my fault that I can't connect with others and then when it comes to relationships, I feel like I get attached too quickly and I slow it down as much as I can but I always screw up somehow by being too attached to that person. I can't control how I feel and I know that I can control how I act but I still end up alone in the end. I have a good family that cares and tries to understand what I'm experiencing but obviously everyone feels different or the extremity of what I feel is greater than what most others I encounter feel. It seems and feels as if it were my fault because I'm not a better person, though I try to be the best person I can be to people. I ask what my meaning is because I feel that death is my meaning in order to impact those around me to change or be better. It's a combination of depression, self hatred, and an abnormal care that I have for others. I don't want to care so much about others but I do. I don't want to feel this way about humanity and those around me but I do. 

Btw thank you to the couple that liked and commented on this post. I didn't really expect anything out of it. I wish I could show my gratefulness in a better way."
