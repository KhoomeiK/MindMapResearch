exmormon,ffpwzys,t3_eujb1b,1580109065.0,"Honestly it's her choice too. I mean I understand how it is, but it does seem kinda juvenile to complain about it. Mormonism makes sex emotionally painful for a lot of people. It's not fair to expect her to have sex whenever."
exmormon,ffpwdnm,t3_euk9kv,1580108320.0,"This sucks, but he sounds too toxic. I wouldn't cut ties with him completely, but he isn't going to be a good person to hang around. Friends don't tell friends that they're wrecking their family for being gay. It's stupid and morally wrong to tell someone that they're sexuality makes them automatically unworthy of sex.

I say move to start forming new social ties. Start building a second support system with new friends and relationships. Healthy relationships are vital to human emotional health."
exmormon,ffpb9gv,t1_ffpb2yv,1580090751.0,"Exactly. There's tons of outside evidence. The sheer amount of ""Mormon canon retcons"" is the initial thing that makes it hard for members."
exmormon,ffp7j2n,t3_eug9gk,1580088186.0,"It's hard to stop doubting what we once knew to be true when God keeps changing his mind about doctrine, or when the church decides that a rock was actually used to receive the BoM, or when we are suddenly informed that no one actually saw the plates at all...."
exmormon,ffp74sm,t3_eugc3z,1580087908.0,"Their defense is that actions have consequences:

Being spiritually and emotionally abused by families as a result of leaving the church is simply the God-sent punishment for doing so, and it means that your family is simply doing God's will by emotionally torturing you. You shouldn't be angry that your family cares so much about you. It hurts them way more than it hurts you, and you should stop being soooo selfish by letting go of the iron rod, you horrible selfish person. Hopefully you don't forget the covenants you made with God, and refrain from sins such as drinking or having sex, or heaven forbid USING THE LORD'S NAME IN VAIN!!! /s

They're awful about it, and they have no idea how much emotional damage they cause through gaslighting. It's essentially emotional torture."
exmormon,ffoebz4,t3_eudm0j,1580076744.0,"There wouldn't be so many religions and philosophers if such answers were attainable as human beings. 

I for one have come to the conclusion that the mormon afterlife is completely false and plagiarized from multiple other sources. I don't believe the first vision occurred, nor do I believe God consecrated Mormonism as the most true church. They hurt and exploit vulnerable people.

While I don't believe in a benevolent, all-powerful god, it's harder to say I don't believe in an afterlife. There very well may be an afterlife, however we don't have definitive proof (or disproof) of one.

Nietzsche said that our progression of knowledge has killed the possibility of god. We killed him in pursuit of knowledge and morality. I think we killed him when we realized the horrors humans have committed against themselves, and when we pursued moral understanding. We've found that, most definitely, god is either not all powerful or not benevolent.

The only things that are for certain are present life and a future death. Live well and pursue healthy relationships. That is happiness. If you cease to exist physically after death, so be it. You won't be conscious of your nonexistence, but you will live on in the memories of those you interacted with on Earth. Ease the suffering of others, oppose those who cause pain, and make lasting relationships with family and friends."
exmormon,ffkm4md,t3_eu3aky,1580025030.0,I hope constantly that there is an afterlife. But there are too many scientific explanations for near-death experiences and such that I can't be satisfied either way.
exmormon,ffklp6j,t3_eu3dlm,1580024827.0,"Look into the cartoonist ""The Naked Pastor"". He's still Christian, but his comics portray the double-standards and hypocrisy of many organized religion. It helps me, even though I don't really believe in a god."
Morrowind,ffk3gsf,t3_eu24fs,1580014643.0,"The first playthrough was awful for me. I screwed up the character stats. I started over with exactly the build I wanted to play, and it was much easier.

It's not quite like skyrim where you can just be a jack of all trades without much consequence. It's easier to plan in advance what skills you need to make the game playable, I guess."
exmormon,ffk2v4s,t3_eu27dx,1580014111.0,Yeah lmao my mom found it absolutely hilarious because if how awful it is. We watched it like a person watches a comedy YouTube channel lmao
Feminism,ffj7isp,t3_etwq1c,1579992337.0,"I've been called a lot of shit for talking about sexism. I admit I'm pretty arrogant and obnoxious, but I feel like it's imperative to point out every instance of prejudice. Especially with how benevolent and explicit sexism has hurt my family.

Once I was told that I was just trying to get laid, which is ironic considering my OCD and germaphobia made sex sound awful. I was worried I'd make someone else sick, either from an STD I didn't have or from some random cold that hadn't set in yet.

My father's parents branded my mother a she-devil for being a feminist, because she wouldn't deal with their sexist bullshit. Then we found out they were enabling my pedophile uncle and coercing victims to stay quiet. Passive-aggressive sexism is now very noticeable to me, and many other people don't understand it the same way."
exmormon,ffilgwj,t3_etu4qz,1579976711.0,Reminds me of the Scopes trial....kills me
exmormon,ffil8wa,t3_etu6yd,1579976557.0,He was a piece of shit. Brigham Young was even worse. The world definitely could have done without them.
exmormon,ffii7ap,t3_ettt2n,1579974466.0,"Their obsession with having kids is so weird. They act like it's the only worthwhile thing a woman can do, and it's disgusting."
exmormon,ffguqx8,t3_etjxic,1579915567.0,"They teach the book of mormon throughout primary. There was some ""Heavenly Father loves you"", but it was never the focus."
NatureIsFuckingLit,ffggduq,t3_ethm8q,1579905629.0,That crocodile knows damn well not to react. He knows that doing so would lead to his savage death.

cats,ffgdc6q,t3_etg2m2,1579903715.0,"We give our cats some treats that act as a laxative. It helps the hair move through easier, so if they do swallow a bunch of hair they don't hack it up as bad. Temptations Hairball Control or something. They love them too."
exmormon,ffgct8e,t3_etg5ul,1579903386.0,"I care because they enable pedophiles.

I care because they encourage suicide among the LGBTQ community. 

I care because they suppress women's rights.

I care because they encourage racism.

And I care because they hurt my family."
