popping,fc6bca3,t1_fbgp6ai,1577476602.0,"My sister was nicknamed “Bug” because she had jaundice and was yellow, making them have to put her under some sort of special light. I think they also used a blanket that had those lights in it, too. I’m  not exactly sure how they treated it, cause it was my older sister who had it, but all I know for sure is that I used to laugh at the fact she was yellow as a baby. I can’t laugh much now, though, cause I learned that I was the fat baby. Came out being the biggest of the three kids my mom had.
I had a triple chin...so I can’t really laugh at anyone."
