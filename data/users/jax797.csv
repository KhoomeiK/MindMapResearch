It is a semi crappy imperfect system, but it works ok for all involved.  There is no perfect fix, but if you have it, present it to every conservatory you can think of.  I didn't want to argue, only help educate.  This is a massively complicated subject, and as a hunter I still struggle with it just as much as you.  I am just coming out of anxiety issue of my own as well.  I hope it gets better for us all."
iamverysmart,ffpa8o3,t1_ffozvts,1580090036.0,"Just a short point.  If you remove the deer, problem animal, the other animals who live off the deer also suffer.  You can't just remove a large species and have no repercussions in that envieoment.  Also the hunting industry is a huge gain for midwestern economies.  I don't think you have a grasp on how this all works from the outside.  A lot of places in the West, South, Midwest, and even Northeast, and Canada would all suffer. Meaning a definite net loss in economies."
