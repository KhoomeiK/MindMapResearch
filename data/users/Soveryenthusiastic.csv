asoiaf,ffa5iho,t1_ff3y7az,1579728286.0,"Really? I have read A World Of Ice And Fire like 5 times, and I'm on 2nd reading of Fire And Blood.  

I started reading the books right after Dance came out and for me I just love the entire universe. I completely understand how annoying it is not to have the main series continued, but I'm a lore hound so literally anything about the world fascinates me. You should try Dunk and Egg if you haven't read that yet. 
I do want the next book as soon as possible, but I personally really love all the additional stuff. It would be nice if they were out already though, but it's been so long that my enthusiasm has shifted to anything about 'Planetos'.   

I'd love to read the new book, but I'm also really looking forward to Fire and Blood part 2. That's probably a really controversial mind set around these parts, but honestly if I focus on the main series too much there's a higher chance it'll be disappointing or something. All the hate for the lateness is completely understandable thought, since people who predominantly read the main series have been stuck in some kind of stasis for what feels like hundreds of years."

doctorwho,fdc0cpd,t1_fdbaraw,1578264674.0,"No it can't, and they shouldn't. We had 40 years of the Doctor and Timelords being enigmatic, and then another nearly 20 of New Who being extra extra enigmatic. I think we are long past the point that we need any exposition about Gallifrey and the Time Lords. Maybe of this was the like the 5th series or something, but it's been almost 60 years and we only know what we can piece together from hearsay and tiny little segments. The scene where Clara hid under The Doctors bed in (can't remember the episodes name - silence or shadow or something like that, the one with the chalk board. Anyway,) that scene was the perfect amount of Gallifrey Lore, we don't need an entire origin story for the Timelords.  

And even if we didz I really don't think I'd like it to come from Chibnall, not right now anyway.  
Long story short, you are absolutely right, and I really hope that if this is true it turns out to be a lie and the Daleks are messing around with the Doctor or something.  

Plus, is it really necessary to undercut William Hartnell's Doctor? He was the first, and I really don't hope they retcon in another."

But yes I agree with you. That wasn't some random episode, that was the 50th anniversary special, its legacy should have lived on for a bit longer, and Gallifrey being destroyed off screen again is a little rubbish.



(You can ignore all this bit I went off on a random rant that doesn't really make any sense)

~~I'm not trying to jump on the ""complain about the showrunner"" bandwagon but when with all these references to older episodes the show feels really really disconnected. I get that people may have felt like that in 2006 when the show started again, and there are probably a lot of new fans hopping on now too. It's a shame though, because the transition between The End Of Time Part 2 and The Eleventh hour was brilliant.~~"
