dogs,ffipco6,t1_ffhvpx6,1579979382.0,Exactly! Thank you
AskReddit,ffgwpro,t1_ffgw2r7,1579917000.0,"You did though man. I'm sure if someone said to you when you were at your lowest that you would get where you are now, you wouldn't believe them. I think everyone should take some inspiration from that, well done to ya"
AskReddit,ffgdm6v,t1_ffga3n8,1579903888.0,"That's a reflection of that girl, not you, bro. There's nothing wrong with you. Don't judge yourself for other people's shortcomings in dealing with emotion. You certainly didn't make a mistake in opening up, you found something out about someone that you needed to find out sooner or later. There's someone out there who will be able to give you exactly what you need when you need support, keep your head up."
AskReddit,ffgclk2,t3_etcyd6,1579903254.0,Let us loose in the wild for a minimum of 48 hours every 2 weeks.
dogs,ffg6p7j,t3_etd5f7,1579899626.0,"Very sorry to hear about what happened! That should be something no dog owner ever has to deal with. 

However, I will always let my dogs off their leads. I don't know how everybody thinks their dogs are getting the exercise they need if you're only walking them alongside you on a lead. I'm assuming a lot of the comments in this thread are from US based dog owners and as far as I know shits pretty weird over there. So I can't really comment on how being a dog owner works in the  US. I have 2 border collies and they need running hard to expell some energy! I could never keep them on the lead for their whole walks, I'd feel cruel."

soccer,ff48biz,t3_ereta4,1579557732.0,"I think Souness proposed the best idea for a new offside rule. If any part of a player is onside then he's inside, would cut out all this shit with VAR and we'd see more goals"
LiverpoolFC,ff3mww0,t1_ff3fo9s,1579544470.0,"We will score against city, they are dreadful at the back. We'll nip at least 2 goals, I can't see them scoring twice or more against us really. It should be a good game but I just can't see us losing at the moment"
soccer,ff1tr9f,t1_feqtb6m,1579485993.0,Best defender in the world made block head look a bitch today hahaha
LiverpoolFC,ff1elps,t1_ff0xp07,1579478219.0,"The difference is we don't call them shite, Mo was rubbish today but he's been brilliant in the last 2 or 3. You need to get a bit of a thicker skin and not take people's instantaneous reactions to a substandard performance to heart. Being a real fan isn't just sitting there and singing praises when that's not what's called for."
LiverpoolFC,ff1dyxp,t3_er3dxn,1579477962.0,"I hear what you're saying and it would be nice if everyone spewed nothing but positivity but thats just unrealistic to expect. Obviously we're Liverpool fans and obviously we support the players. If Mo has a shit game I'm going to say he's having a shit game, doesn't mean I don't support him. Don't read match threads if you don't want to see opinions on matches."
LiverpoolFC,ff1dbvw,t1_ff187f6,1579477732.0,But surely you'd never play advantage in that situation. It's not as if there was a break in and he's letting a foul go in order to play advantage. Any team would've wanted the free kick to reset and clear their lines.
LiverpoolFC,ff1cjgo,t1_ff13h0n,1579477505.0,"Roy Keane thought it shouldve been given too did he? I've not seen any post match reaction, I was already late to work by watching the game haha"

PremierLeague,fekw0ad,t3_epldfb,1579208754.0,"In New Zealand we have this. It's an online streaming service that shows all premier league games. I'm in two minds about it still because on one hand, you can watch all the games at any time, no need to remember to record or anything like that. However, in order to watch any cup matches or European games you either need to pay for sky as well, or try to find streams online. Pros and cons"
LiverpoolFC,fekvmrz,t1_fejmwyx,1579208531.0,Doesn't make it untrue though!
BeAmazed,fekcm93,t1_fej85tp,1579197245.0,"Could be, some places do good work in rehabilitation and all of that kind of thing. But none of those places encourage climbing on elephants' faces"
BeAmazed,feiqgcg,t3_epbmyz,1579144647.0,Real cool but fuck that was tough to watch
BeAmazed,feikedf,t3_ep785n,1579140575.0,Please don't go to these places
soccer,feh6g3n,t1_feh3ij7,1579110131.0,"Yeah maybe it was harsh saying he's been wank, that's not really true. You've said it yourself though, he's been good this season, but he's been here a year and a half now. I just can't see how you can rate someone so highly when they've underperformed for so long"
soccer,fefqfzz,t1_fefp0wk,1579062272.0,"It took him months to get up to premier league pace, he's spent more time sidelined due to injury than he has being match fit. In my opinion, I've seen more weak performances that class ones. That's not to say I don't see his potential, he can be quality, we've seen flashes of it for sure, but he's not doing it consistently enough and that's what matters. Statistics are fun to analyse but they tell a fraction of the story, I watch games and judge what I see on the pitch."
soccer,fef4t9c,t1_feerhor,1579048190.0,"Bro I appreciate your enthusiasm but keita had been wank for the vast majority of the time he's been at Liverpool. Couple of good performances of late, but so far overall he's really been a let down."

LiverpoolFC,fec1r7a,t1_fe9sacy,1578965391.0,And we are the most decorated club in England
LiverpoolFC,fdxnwx5,t3_enbuds,1578771046.0,"A bit more than a bit lucky today to be honest. Poor performances from Hendo especially, along with a few others. Despite that we looked good for most of the game, just a very tense 20 minutes at the end. Mo looked a different player today, playmaking like he hasn't done for a long time. 3 points in the bag, most points any team has ever had after this many games. Good day overall"
LiverpoolFC,fdxjjc5,t1_fdxjfvi,1578769323.0,"True mate, a lot of bang average performances tonight and we still look good"
