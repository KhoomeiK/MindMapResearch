To give an analogy of how big of an event this is, imagine Iran targeting the US Join Chiefs of Staff. Tensions between the US and Iran have already been running high and now there's fears that there will be an even bigger retaliation from Iran leading to an all out war which no one wants.

The increased tension between US and Iran might not lead to a conventional war but it may lead to Iran Increasing weapons proliferation in the Middle East to enemies of the US which will result in more innocent people dying. US may increase sanctions which will ruin the lives of more innocent people."
