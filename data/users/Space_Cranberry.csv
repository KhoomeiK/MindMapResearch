casualiama,fdlte50,t1_fdlskvi,1578532048.0,"Gender identity isn’t chromosomes. Gender is a social thing. You’re thinking biological sex. And With two sets of genitals, she may have an extra x or y in there. I can’t remember and not sure if she mentioned her chromosomes. I think there’s even an Xxyyy or xxxyy syndrome out there. That’s a stumper."
frogs,fdlsnlm,t3_elrvw8,1578531551.0,"I had 2 of these once upon a time. Smirk and lurk, my zen frogs. In the middle of the night I heard a buzzing sound. I thought it was electricity. I stuck my ear by every light, but no. Finally figured out it was the frogs! One was singing!

AmItheAsshole,fdlpbgm,t3_eluqog,1578529276.0,"She’s the asshole for bringing a junkie into your house. Less than a year sobriety isn’t a “non-addict”. It’s someone to “trust—but verify” because they are still fragile. 

She is the asshole in case you didn’t hear that."

Don’t let a con turn you off of keeping an open heart. 

However, first day, it helps to deliberately say what services the school offers for disabilities, etc and retroactive excuses don’t cut it. They have to communicate."
