KingdomHearts,fdgtsn2,t1_fdgt4fe,1578408139.0,"It's really funny you mention this because there was a whole thread about this exact topic not too long ago - I'm starting to think it's something with the rights lol which is crazy because they own everything but the FF, but maybe they can't put it in the parks as an attraction yet? Idk. It would be hard to believe that they wouldn't take advantage of the cash cow like they do with practically everything else lol

 or maybe they're just now starting to plan things seeing as the series is becoming more popular to the general public ? Someone ask Disney lol"
