offmychest,ffbhyvu,t3_esppna,1579766148.0,"I hope you find someone that's looking for their own little someone, and that you both make each other's lives a little brighter. Just remember that relationships take work to grow and do well, even at the point where it's just friendship. :)"
offmychest,ffbhc3x,t3_esp4p6,1579765319.0,I'm really happy you found something that makes you feel like a hero. I hope you find more things that can make you feel that way!
specializedtools,ff877cn,t1_ff866ai,1579667956.0,I had my nose cauterized and it makes your eyes water but isn't too bad. Imagine getting a dozen hairs yanked out of your nose at once and that's kinda what it's like.
destiny2,fewueqz,t3_eqobqm,1579419645.0,"Suros is beastly in crucible. I've had it forever but only just got the catalyst tonight, and I decided to try and get the kills needed for it. Even not fully improved yet suros wins 75-90% of duels that aren't against LH/NF. I don't know why I never see it in crucible tbh."
offmychest,felksvi,t1_fekvmj0,1579224561.0,"I haven't read that book, but that is an almost perfect description of how I get through my days. The hard part is that the pain or sadness doesn't ever stop, it feels like I'm always just delaying it.

I hope you manage to get past the darkness and stay past it friend. It's not something anyone should go through alone, feel free to vent about it. I would be glad to listen."
FightingLion,feei70u,t1_fee6q4z,1579034256.0,"Cloak is the moment of triumphs 2019 cloak with the solar glow. I can't remember exactly what the shader was, as this is from a while ago."
destiny2,fecyofe,t3_eo8h9t,1578990102.0,"Hush isn't even that bad of a grind, I don't get why people are complaining so much about it really. I can't quite remember how long it took cause it was a while ago, but with Le Monarque getting guardian kills is easy and doesn't that progress it quicker? I'm pretty sure I got it done before I got my first infamy rank reset, and I was doing 21% at the same time too."
destiny2,fecy3gn,t1_fecx3ax,1578989347.0,Make em hate you and use truth.
MovieDetails,fdweoak,t1_fdw9fey,1578757937.0,"You are correct the arm is still attached, but if you look specifically at her forearm you can see that it's skinnier than it should be. I couldn't find what actually happened to it in the article, but I assume it's a mix of getting her arm partially scraped away by the road, and withering away because of the lack of muscle in recovery."
MovieDetails,fdw4c6f,t1_fdvzn54,1578754880.0,"I commented below, but [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BGWVsZ0ga8P/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_mid=F9B46F77-E8AC-4EFD-92B9-8AF6BBAA5D40) is a picture of what they were talking about when they said her forearm was never found. This picture is in the article, but a direct link to it might be easier for people who just got confused about her arm."
MovieDetails,fdw31od,t1_fdw0xq0,1578754559.0,"They were talking about the big chunk missing from her arm. You can see in the picture how skinny her forearm is, that's because of the accident, so they amputated it."

boottoobig,fdatgmo,t3_ekeh16,1578249918.0,"I was gonna make a joke about that being a hoe, but I looked it up just in case and learned that an agricultural spade and a hoe are pretty much the same thing. I always thought spade meant the basic shovel type of spade. TIL"
gifs,fdar9th,t1_fd9ztdv,1578249207.0,This right here. I don't understand why you wouldn't. Can someone who does this explain?

LifeProTips,fda10j3,t1_fd9xa7f,1578240411.0,"In other words, make a giant I've cube inside a water bottle so when you take it out and add water it gets really cold fast. Have a second bottle with the big ol' ice cube in it and also have water before you're right about to drink it so it's already cold for you."

destiny2,fcwq3xx,t3_ej81y1,1578033256.0,"Not really answering your question since it seems like it has been already, but the ships you see pull into the tower are actually other guardians ships loading into the tower. You can sometimes see your ship fly off from where you spawn in or from the hanger if you run there."
destiny2,fcvnsep,t3_ej5qzu,1578006092.0,"It's interesting, but it's not a very efficient way to get the ingredients. It would be much easier to just fly to a world with the enemies you need and farm them through lost sectors or something.

Cool find though :)"
destiny2,fcvja4u,t3_eixpr4,1578003284.0,"I'd say make another titan, give it some time and you might start to like the new titan better than your first. At that point get rid of poor Matt and make a warlock just to round out your slots."

destiny2,fcvfqo0,t1_fcupfr4,1578001151.0,"How does playing multiple characters give you more vault space? If you mean the inventory of the alt, then thats only gonna help if he doesn't play it at all.

FightingLion,fcvf0bl,t1_fc36898,1578000716.0,what about sprint/swap does that still end the animation quicker?
