Originalmente cuando empezé a mantenerme solo me puse a ahorrar para eventualmente llegar al 30%-40% del valor de dpto en efectivo, asi poder pagar el resto con un credito que sea accesible. Pero en lo que tarde en ahorrar 8000 dolares, el valor de un 2 ambientes se fue de 50 lucas verdes a 80 y seguia subiendo.

Sintiendo que con cada mes que pasaba me alejaba en vez de acercarme al departamento, me dieron ganas mandar todo a la mierda y disfrutar la plata en vez de encanutarla para algo que parecia que nunca iba a pasar.

El auto me parecio un buen punto medio entre despilfarrar y ahorrar. Y si bien estaba bien mantenido, el auto viejo tenia 22 años ya. La verdad estoy disfrutando mucho tener y manejar este nuevo.

argentina,ff7k0gj,t1_ff6zcwo,1579651364.0,"Lo de pagar todo el auto para sacarlo es mentira. Yo el mio lo saque en la cuota 18 de 84 sin poner un peso mas (sin contar impuestos pero es otra historia) no habia pagado ni la cuarta parte del valor total del auto y ya lo tenia. Asi que a no ser que algun telemarketer de dudosa procedencia te lo venda, quedate tranquilo. En todo caso vayan ustedes a buscar el plan a un concesionario oficial de la marca que sea en vez de dejarselo vender por cualquier otro medio para estar 100% seguros.

Los vendedores te lo chamuyan mucho mas color de de rosas de lo que realmente es. Las cuotas no son fijas, son mas bien un porcentaje fijo del valor de ""vidriera"" del auto, el cual sube con la inflación. Ademas del valor que te dice el vendedor todos los meses vas a estar pagando un poco de ""gastos administrativos"" y un Seguro de vida, que suelen subir el valor de todo un 10% maximo. Otra cosa que no te dicen es que los descuentos enormes que te hacen en las primeras cuoutas, lo tenes ""devolver"" de a poquito en todas las demas. En mi caso fueron descuentos dentre 50 a 25% las primeras 10 cuotas, que devolvi como un 4% extra en las ,60 siguientes.

Otra cosa muy importante que tenes que tener en cuenta es que es muy probable que estes pagando por 2 años antes de ver el auto.

Tene en cuenta todo esto asi sabes en lo que te metes antes de arrepentirte. 

Si decidis salirte del plan perdiste. Te devuelven solo lo que pagaste como ""cuota pura"". No te devuelven nada de lo que pagaste como otros conceptos. Terminas perdiendo minimo 10% de la plata que pusieron sin contar que cada peso que te devuelven tiene menos poder de compra que el dia que lo pusiste por la devaluación. Ademas no se si tendras que pagar algo para cancelar, pero no me sorprenderia.

El curro o la ""estafa"" esta en toda la gente que entra pensando que van a pagar 2 pesos y les van a regalar un auto y despues de un año se dan cuenta que no es asi y terminan saliendo. 

En mi caso calcule que el plan de ahorro a 7 años para un cero me iba a salir un poco mas en total, pero menos por mes que un credito bancario a 5 años para un usado de 5-7 años y 100 000+ km, ademas yo ya tenia un autito asi que no me molesto esperar el tiempo que espere. Para mi valio la pena y no me arrepiento.

Donde si la comi fue con los gastos de patentación al momento de sacarlo. Casi toda la plata que saque de vender el auto viejo fue a pagar impuestos. Y me ""cagaron"" alrededor de 5k extra en ""comisiones"" para un ""gestor"" ya que aparentemente como el auto esta prendado no puedo ir yo mismo a hacer el tramite y si o si lo tiene que hacer la concesionaria.

Otra cosa con la que tenes que estar atento cuando lo sacas es con el seguro, te pueden clavar un todo riesgo mucho mas caro que el valor del mercado y no te dejan cambiarlo hasta que pagues mas del 60% del auto (lo cual es recontra ilegal). Yo por suerte safe me vino con un seguro que de hecho era mejor y mas barato que lo que averigue por mi cuenta. Parece que a Fiat le metieron tantas denuncias por eso que para cuando saque el mio no lo hacian mas."
argentina,ff7cwz1,t1_ff6xib2,1579646643.0,"El curro o la estafa esta realmente en toda la gente que se baja antes de sacar el auto. Si sabes bien como funciona para no llevarte sorpresas despues puede ser la financiación mas conveniente segun tu situación econonomica

Los vendedores te lo chamuyan mucho mas lindo de lo que es, y una vez que entraste te das cuenta que cuesta bastante mas y las cuotas no son fijas fijas, si no que son un porcentaje fijo que sube segun el valor de lista del auto (el cual obviamente siempre va a estar subiendo por la devaluacion). Ademas de eso siempre hay un cachito de ""gastos administravos"" que te cobran todos los meses. 

Mucha gente se baja antes del año porque se encuentran con que estan pagando mucho mas de lo que pensaban, y encima todavia no tienen el auto.

Al que se baja le devuelven solamente lo que pagaron de ""cuota pura"", y no les devuelven nada de que pagaron como otros conceptos. Al final terminan perdiendo mas o menos 10% de la plata que pusieron sin contar el valor de la moneda que te comio la devaluación, ahi esta la estafa.

Teniendo bien claro todo lo que puse arriba, hace 3 años cuando me meti al plan de ahorro del mio, calcule que la cuota para sacar un cero a 7 años era menos de lo que que me hubiera salido la cuota de un credito bancario a 5 años para un usado de 7 años con 100 000+ km. 

Saque el auto mas o menos a la cuota 18 o 19. Muchos pueden pensar que es demasiado tiempo pagando antes de ver el coche y es verdad, pero como yo ya tenia auto de antes no tenia mucho apuro asi que al final me salio todo mas o menos redondito.

Otro lugar donde te pueden cagar es con el seguro. Pueden clavarte un seguro todo riesgo que no te dejan cambiar hasta saldar el plan y muy por arriba del valor del mercado, lo cual es ilegal y si estas preparado podes arreglarlo pero es un garron. A mi por suerte no me toco comerme eso.

Donde si la comi fue con los gastos de patentación, todo lo que saque de vender el auto viejo fue a pagar impuestos. Y yo pensaba que iba a poder adelantar un año de cuotas. Pobre iluso."

Voorhis seems to know about real Ciri being his daughter ans being lost beforehand, and connects dots.

Now, Emhyr married the fake Ciri because of the political importance of Ciri's lineage. Of course only a handful of people know she is a fake. The whole world thinks Emhyr married real Ciri, and also don't know she's his daughter. Why would he need the real one and why would Voorhis know she was his daughter and talk about it so casually? 

Only two ways this would make sense is if Emhyr came clean to the whole empire but he wouldn't las 2 days on the throne after such scandalous revelation. Or CDPR simply disregarded fake Ciri's existence.

Another possibility is he getting rid of fake Ciri and wanted to stealthily replace her for real Ciri but Voorhis wouldn't know about that and the whole business isn't secretive enough to make sense."

But my point is, despite those changes the end result is the same. Calanthe gave in and Duny married Pavetta, Calanthe married the Skellige guy, Geralt got stuck by destiny with Ciri, Cintra fell, Calanthe died, Ciri scaped, now Ciri is with Geralt.

Every piece needed to go on with story is in the same place as in the end of the short stories and beggining of the novels except that Ciri and Geralt are complete strangers instead of having spent a day together (or was it a couple days?), Cahir is apparently a general or similar military leader which won't matter too much if he then deflects, and Vigelfortz doesn't seem as overpowered as he should.

I only remember her for the Witcher 2 game.

Even book Fringilla is too much of a minor character whose impact on the plot can easily be replaced, I mentioned her in part because this new Fringilla is something that may have to be dealt with eventually, but mostly for the implication of the guild of mages having influence over Nilfgaard, which I believe is more of a big change to the world itself rather that the characters individually. 

I still believe the only character changes that may be too disruptive of the plot unless handled well from now on are Vigelfortz and Cahir"
gaming,ff2hz5x,t1_ff2h4e2,1579506951.0,"In the books Geralt randomly met Ciri twice. once in Brokilon when she got lost as a toddler, and after the massacre of Cintra. It helps to show how much are they connected by destiny and gives them a bit of affectional bonding.

gaming,ff2fzvc,t1_ff2e6zl,1579504523.0,"I don't know about that (**SPOILERS**)

The only character which strayed way too far from the books is Fringilla. I don't see possible her eventual relatively minor role in Touissant with Geralt, and by extension the whole concept of Nilfgaardian mages being separate from North's mages which may in turn make it impossible for a book accurate Assire. 

Aside from that the rest of the story can very well follow the general direction of the books even with the changes presented.

This is assuming Vilgefortz purpossedly lost against Cahir (Vilgefortz is supposed to be the most overpowered character ever shown in the whole series, and Cahir, while a good fighter, should be nothing near exceptional). And also that they manage to find a compelling way to make Cahir have his change of heart since the way it was presented, he seems to be a shallow bad guy and not in the slightlest conflicted with anything he does.

Does this mean micropenises can be ""fixed"" with steroids? Assuming lack of hormones are the cause. I have no Idea how micropenises come to be, if they are genetical deformities or just underdevelopment."

I understand how that can cause some confusion, I see a lot of such mistakes in my language too. Meanwhile we learned first by reading, then how to pronounce things.
