I don't think the deck influenced my style of play (I'm sort of a Timmy/Johnny player), but it's influenced my deck building strategy a lot. I usually start out with a little deck core of about 20-40 cards which fit whatever I'm going with, and then use filler cards and basic lands to pad the deck out to the full 100 cards, so there's a lot of janky draft chaff floating about the early iterations of my decks, and then I test them a few times and get a feel for the deck, and I can then properly assess what it needs, and which commander I should go with to match my playstyle/playgroup the best."
