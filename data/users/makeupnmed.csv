Mcat,fcmhcmq,t1_fcluw8e,1577775301.0,why is she reviewing things as a STUDENT??? i never understand that. its like being a psychology BA student and telling someone they may have depression. that is not ur place. ur in school to learn not to teach.

It doesnt matter  if ur Family Medicine (which actually im super interested in and pediatrics), or a surgeon (which would be super fucking cool too) ur a fucking doctor and ur an amazing person."

All this means is that she basically studied for 4 years. It DID NOT HAPPEN IN 18 DAYS. its fucking crazy how they have the audacity to LIE to pre-meds giving them hopes that 18 days is enough is such fuck shit."

criminalminds,fc7n732,t1_fc7fplt,1577513048.0,oh and he also mentions when they were talking about drugs I think it was a serial killer I don’t remember exactly the episode but he was saying how people use him murdering as their kind of drug and they keep needing it more and more to make him more stimulating and Hotchner and Gideon give him like a look and he kind of like hides his face but I don’t know if Gideon knew about it but like they also didn’t know because when they are talking about him struggling they only mentioned him having like PTSD a little bit but I’m not sure I mean he probably knew about the drugs but yeah.
criminalminds,fc7n41a,t3_eglrdb,1577512958.0,same !! it rlly bothered me how it was only ‘present’ in like other episodes where he takes out the bottles in the bathroom but doesn’t and then when he snappy at everyone. and then for a long time they ignore it and then when Hotchner is thinking of leaving the BAU He mentions how one of his agents may have a drug problem but like they don’t touch on it at all really he just tells Spencer that he needs to focus more sometimes and I wish they would’ve broken that down because he such a central character and he’s so important he’s a soft boy and he deserves better. i’m barely on season three episode 12 and I just wish they could’ve cared for him a little bit more.
