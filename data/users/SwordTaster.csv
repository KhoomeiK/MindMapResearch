We became the dominant species not by being able to hit things the hardest but by being able to think the smartest. We can easily be slain by faster or stronger predators but give us the time to think and prepare and we can usually work out a way to trap them.""

""Then you squishy flesh puppets may have a problem. Every time a planet grows a dominant species, the rulers of the universe pluck the strongest specimen and it is entered into a battle to the death against the top specimens from every other planet in a 5 light year radius. No prep time, no prior information, no weapons other than those you can craft from the environment. And every other planet in your radius has specimens stronger, faster and bigger than your 'strongest man'. He is half the size of the next smallest.""

""What, pray tell, are the consequences for losing this tournament?""

""Winner gets to continue as a species and is granted the gift of interstellar travel if they're intelligent enough to comprehend it, though thus far none have been able to claim the secondary prize.""

""Carry on as a species... You mean the losers are all wiped out‚ÄΩ Is that what happened to the dinosaurs‚ÄΩ""

""Oh yes, the T-Rex was incredibly impressive but the stubby arms are what caused its failure. It couldn't reach when it needed to grab a ledge""

Oh dear. This could be an issue. This creature is correct, humanity is definitely smaller and more squishy than a T-Rex. Perhaps though we can use that to our advantage...

""Who selects the specimen to enter the arena? The organisers or the species representative contacted?""

"" Usually it is the organisers as many species aren't articulate enough to ask, however being as you have asked and as you seem to be at a distinct disadvantage, you may choose. I grant you a day to think upon your choice. I will return in 24 hours and I will take them.""

WritingPrompts,fdxlvac,t3_enaufo,1578770368.0,"It's an odd creature, I'm sure I've read about them before but never seen an image. It's both bald and hairy at once, no hair anywhere except for the head. This one is apparently male though it insists upon covering it's genital area with a scrap of cloth. This one is young, apparently, a mere 23 years old, a blip in time compared to my 762 years, though they apparently reach maturity for breeding anywhere between 12-16 years old (though breeding them that young is HIGHLY frowned upon and in most places is actually illegal).

""How much for him?"" I hear myself asking
""Just 700 credits"" for such an exotic species that's definitely a bargain, though it's likely that may mean he has behavioural issues.
""I'll take him!"" I can't fully fathom why but I felt possessed by a need to take him home. He's only 6 feet tall, barely reaches my knee, likely won't cause trouble even in my modest apartment.
""Does he have a name?"" I enquired, it'd be cruel to change it if he did.
""Whzipt is what we call him but he doesn't really respond to it, you can change it if you like, maybe you can get him to listen to you if you find the right one. Do you want a leash or crate to get him home? He's had his shots so that won't be an issue""
""Crate please, it'll make his ride home more comfortable. I'll pay another 20 credits so I can keep it for vet visits""
""Deal""

Arriving home I carefully opened the crate in my living room and tried to coax the strange creature I had adopted out of the place it now deemed safe. He wasn't listening to my calling his name nor the rattle of the bag of human treats I had purchased for him. Perhaps he wasn't hungry yet and would come out when he was ready. I placed a bowl of food on the ground and a small cup of water for when his stomach decided he must leave the crate to eat. After a few hours more of trying I went to bed, leaving him in his crate.

The following morning I walked down the stairs and over to where I'd left my new pet. His food and water were empty but he was back in his crate, curled up asleep under the newspaper. I gently reached in a picked up the paper and lifted him out, still asleep in my arms a few seconds before coming to. He screamed! I dropped him in my fear and he ran and hid under the sofa, I hoped I hadn't hurt him. Peeking slowly underneath I could see him at the back side near the wall. It sounds like he's trying to talk to me.
""Shhh, Whzipt, shhh, I'm not gonna hurt you"" I cooed, trying to comfort my clearly terrified pet
""Why do you keep calling me that‚ÄΩ What are you‚ÄΩ Where am I‚ÄΩ""
I was shocked. He could talk!!!"
