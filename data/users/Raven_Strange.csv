For me, I had much of the same and towards other people's kids. One day I noticed myself getting angry at kids for laughing loudly while they played on a playground. That was my ""holy shit"" moment. I started looking deep into my past and discovered two things: I was angry at my recent divorce, for one, but the other was a little more deeply seeded. 

When I was a kid I had teachers and various other adults CONSTANTLY scold me for acting out, but like I was doing. I was only being a kid, but it seemed to upset those who forgot what a kid was supposed to be like. I grew up thinking that adulthood was acting stern and being all about business, and that it was an adults job to make sure kids acted the same way.

Coupled with my anger and depression from my divorce, I went hard on scolding kids. I took a step back and forced myself to appreciate their innocence. I learned to enjoy their play, remembering what it was like to be free from worry. Over time I had to force those thoughts less and less, and found them become more natural.

It's obvious you've already had that ""holy shit"" moment, now you just have to figure out how to best change. It's a constant struggle, but you'll get there in time. Meditation works really well for this kinda stuff. I wish you well in your healing."

When I was but a youth, I had just lost my virginity and was excited at this new world that had opened up to me. I coordinated with my girlfriend to ditch school on a specific day to practice our collective techniques (flailing haphazardly). When I got there, she surprised me with two furry handcuffs and promptly bound me to her headboard.

Mid-session, her psychotic father opens the front door and yells, ""WHO'S HERE?!"" She had just finished drawing a smiley on my chest with chocolate body paint, using my nipples for the eyes, when she jump-scare-lept off me, bending my dinker to near-fracture. She couldn't find the keys, so I used the fear version of that strength a mother gets when she lifts a car off a newborn to break her headboard. She grabbed a towel, and all I could find was my pants.

I was sure he knew I was there. How could he not? He had an inkling that his daughter was a delinquent to assumed enough that she'd skipped school to come home early to check. On top of that, he walked right past my bicycle I left at the front door like an idiot.

I jumped out her window and hid in her impossibly tall grass, that had been neglected much like her relationship with her father. I went to the back of the property and hopped the fence. On the other side I realized that I still had the pink, fuzzy handcuffs on, and the only smile on my way the crudely drawn chocolate on my chest, mocking me. As I walked up and down the street, trying to hide from the honking cars cat-calling me, I thought of all the ways her father would kill me.

 Suddenly, my girlfriend glides up to me on her rollerblades like an angel, but one that just skipped bail on a drug charge, now fully dressed with a backpack containing all my clothes. She managed to convince her dad that she got something spilled on her at school, so she came home in her free period to shower and change. Her astounding ability to convincingly lie at a moment's notice should have foreshadowed me to what was in store for our relationship, but hormones are a hell of a thing. I got dressed on the street and ninja-rolled past the living room window where her dad was already cracking open his third cold one to grab my bike.
