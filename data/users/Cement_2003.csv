depression,fe6bdns,t1_fe6azlx,1578886120.0,"Lol I drink like no water but I've gotten better and ive been drinking 24 ounces a day 

Sounds reasonable, I've been trying to do that


Also reasonable, I suck at portions but I'm definitely going to cut out a lot more junk food and have actual meals with small portions 

Yeah, it's best for small steps, I've tried just cold turkey eating less and it never worked, I do need to learn to ease onto it 


Thank you for the advice, very helpful and I'll definitely try to take the baby steps"

He spent around 1,000 dollars in junk food in the 2 months of summer break (he gave me all the receipts and I added it all up) 

It did not work, I have blocked all communication with him and I fully regret not getting my mom involved sooner and I fully regret just eating all of it"
