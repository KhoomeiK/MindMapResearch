What finally helped me was therapy and accepting what I have is a severe mental illness. One that colours my life every day. Once I grasped that I committed to being on medication which was something I’d fought thinking I could “beat” bipolar through sheer force of will. 

Bipolar is frankly terrible and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. 

Please hang in there and reach out for help. It takes a while for medication to start to work but you sound in a really bad place and when you’re that low it seems like it’ll never get better.

He asked what I was getting out of them beyond the toxicity. Once I looked at it that way it became easier to back out and spend time with people who don’t bring the drama and baggage. 

Some friends I’ve let go, not a big falling out just gradually eased them out of my life. They weren’t able to see past my diagnosis or the changes (like giving up drinking) that I was making. 

Family too although it’s hard as my parents are in ill-health and OAP’s. I see them when I feel up to it and keep a time limit on how long I’m there. If it gets too much I say so and leave. Again not in an argument but choosing to leave like an adult lol. Taken me a long time to get there :-) 

Have people in your life that enrich you not drag you down. Coping with our illness is hard enough without negative input.

Don’t think you can be too close to your dogs. Well not in my opinion anyway but I’m dog mad as well as being diagnosed mad."

BipolarReddit,fed50v0,t3_eoexpl,1578999190.0,"I struggled with my diagnosis for two years despite knowing in my heart of hearts that I was bipolar. As soon as it was official I tried to deny and fight it. 

Like you I can look back at my life and highlight all the bad and embarrassing decisions Iâ€™ve made while hypomanic or depressed. My brain doesnâ€™t like to focus on the good times only the negative. 

What finally helped me was therapy and accepting what I have is a severe mental illness. One that colours my life every day. Once I grasped that I committed to being on medication which was something Iâ€™d fought thinking I could â€œbeatâ€ bipolar through sheer force of will. 

Bipolar is frankly terrible and I wouldnâ€™t wish it on my worst enemy. 

Please hang in there and reach out for help. It takes a while for medication to start to work but you sound in a really bad place and when youâ€™re that low it seems like itâ€™ll never get better. 

It does. 

I hope youâ€™re safe and start to feel a little better soon. 

Hugs."

bipolar,fdqweaa,t1_fdqtvg1,1578675795.0,"Thank you! Iâ€™m doing my best :-) I my last psychologist put my close relationships in a different light. He asked what I was getting out of them beyond the toxicity. Once I looked at it that way it became easier to back out and spend time with people who donâ€™t bring the drama and baggage. 

Some friends Iâ€™ve let go, not a big falling out just gradually eased them out of my life. They werenâ€™t able to see past my diagnosis or the changes (like giving up drinking) that I was making. 

Family too although itâ€™s hard as my parents are in ill-health and OAPâ€™s. I see them when I feel up to it and keep a time limit on how long Iâ€™m there. If it gets too much I say so and leave. Again not in an argument but choosing to leave like an adult lol. Taken me a long time to get there :-) 

Have people in your life that enrich you not drag you down. Coping with our illness is hard enough without negative input.

Donâ€™t think you can be too close to your dogs. Well not in my opinion anyway but Iâ€™m dog mad as well as being diagnosed mad."
