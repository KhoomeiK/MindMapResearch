gaidhlig,ffhxrbg,t3_etqgmu,1579958499.0,I don’t know about books as I’m super new to learning Gàidhlig however the Duolingo app is free and will maybe get you to a conversational level if you keep it up!
simpleliving,ffex0u3,t1_ffevrzb,1579868960.0,Thank you! :) Fingers crossed!
simpleliving,ffej2j1,t1_ffehzai,1579850052.0,"Definitely. We’re only allowed to make one request per year, so it had to be a good one. I basically opened by saying the change would benefit the council as they would retain my skills and extensive experience...and I’m assuming they read between the lines there. Or maybe they’re just so desperate to keep any teachers that they just didn’t care. It was approved in less than 2 weeks, when online it says it can take up to 3 months. I think it helped that I’ve requested for the change to happen at the beginning of the next school year (August) which at the time of my application was over 9 months away. So they couldn’t argue any of the “we’d have no time to rearrange the business” and all of that. 

It means I’ve had/have over 9 months to prepare, so in the meantime I’m saving all of the portion of my wage that I will drop, plus more, so that when I do drop, it won’t be noticeable at all, and in fact I’ll actually have more disposable income. So far it’s fine!"
simpleliving,ffeg0at,t1_ffe3kqs,1579846567.0,"All employees in Scotland have [the right](https://www.gov.uk/flexible-working) to request flexible working...not the right to get it, but they can only give one of 8 specific business reasons to say no, and I made sure my application was airtight. Addressed each point and explained why it wouldn’t apply to my case. I’m a teacher, and I basically implied I would leave the job if I wasn’t granted part time. I would have. They’re desperate to keep teachers, so they allowed me. Again, I realise I’m very lucky. My monthly wage will still be more than lots of people make a month. I know it’ll push back my retirement age but I don’t care - at this rate I’d have been long dead before retirement from sheer stress. Life will be much more enjoyable from August!"
simpleliving,ffdggjy,t1_ffdfzep,1579820353.0,"Haha not quite, I live in Scotland and love it. Not a lot of sunshine but that’s perfect for me. ‘Free’ healthcare, all my friends and family are here, my dog by my side...that’s all I need. Should still earn enough for a couple of trips abroad per year. Have already got trips to Skye, Bucharest and Berlin paid off for this year coming so got a head start there!"
simpleliving,ffddw3q,t3_esysq5,1579818823.0,"I’m going part time in August and cannot wait. I’m taking a substantial pay cut, but I hate my job, and hate wishing my life away until the next weekend, next holiday, next whatever. I’ll still have enough to cover everything I need plus still be able to save a little each month, I’m lucky. And I can’t wait to be able to spend time with friends, walk my dog on the beach, paint, read for fun, cook, just actually LIVE. I’ll be working 3 days per week."
vegan,ff70d55,t1_ff6ztg1,1579638592.0,"Thank you!! I did, we had baked potatoes and chilli totally organised but then went and spent a fortune on stuff to make an AMAZING carbonara instead haha. Feel extremely giant now! Potatoes for lunch tomorrow instead :) hope you have a better day tomorrow!"
vegan,ff6tysk,t3_erx8oq,1579634830.0,I had a shit day at work too and this actually cheered me up...I’m glad you had something nice to come home to <3 how lovely.
vegan,ff3m41h,t3_ereqw5,1579543970.0,"Oh and also [this](https://instagram.com/vegansvillage?igshid=190hmhfg2fcfa) Instagram page, VegansVillage, has RIDICULOUSLY attractive photos of food and recipes for each one!"
vegan,ff3lqfs,t3_ereqw5,1579543736.0,"I like [this](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/spinach-sweet-potato-lentil-dhal) sweet potato, lentil and spinach Dahl, and [this](https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-chana-masala/) chana masala. Other than that, we make spag bol, baked potatoes and veggie bean chilli, and stir fries (stir fries are cheap and quick and tasty!!) every week. Then we’ll have pizza one night a week usually, sometimes a wrap with vegan chicken bits, avocado, tomatoes or peppers, and spinach, sometimes hummus too. That sort of thing. Are they willing to try meat replacements or are you wanting to cook from scratch? A vegan lasagna is easy to make. 

That’s awesome they’ve all converted! Breakfast is easy, oats, cereal, fruits, yoghurts, it’s all the same. For lunch I have soup every single day so I’m not good with recommending variety haha, I make a big pot and that’s me for the week. Black bean quesadillas are also one of my favourite meals to have and an easy way to pack a TON of veg in. Same with fajitas! Loads of Mexican and Indian food in this house!"

VeganBeauty,ff3hehx,t3_erfvk3,1579541084.0,"I’ve done the same!! Haha. I love my soaps! The only thing that I use that is still in a plastic bottle is conditioner cos I cannot find a good solid conditioner. Soap is amazing! I use [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Friendly-Soap-Lavender-Geranium-Natural/dp/B07K1TMCTM/ref=mp_s_a_1_14?keywords=lavender+geranium+shampoo&qid=1579540811&sr=8-14) shampoo and the faith in nature soap, I buy the 18 loose bars like once or twice a year, SO cheap, zero plastic, and so nice to use. I used to use the Lush Coalface bar but I’m going even more natural now with an oil/microfibre cloth cleanse in the evening, and my own version of Lush’s Angels on Bare Skin in the morning. Much cheaper and more natural!"

That’s awesome you made it up! Well done!"
veganuk,fezyikz,t3_er0om6,1579463290.0,"This looks good! Was it by any chance the one they made on “living on the veg” this morning on tv? It’s the first time I’ve watched it, can’t believe there’s a plant based cooking show at such a prime time and I loved it! And the lasagne looked amazing!"
vegan,fex7drg,t1_fev2h80,1579425946.0,"I absolutely love hearing that, I love living here and love being Scottish. I hope you end up here! I’ll definitely check out glasvegan! :D We hardly ever go to Edinburgh despite it being less than an hour away haha. I love Edinburgh but we always go there for really special occasions and it’s nice to keep it a really special place, I don’t know if that makes sense but it’s so different to Glasgow that if we go for a weekend it feels like we’ve gone much further away which is nice. I actually think we’re going in Feb so I’ll keep that place in mind, thank you!!"
vegan,feulywl,t1_feuhye9,1579387802.0,"I’ve never been to the glasvegan!!! :O I know, terrible...but there are so many places and I’m so spoiled with them all that I never know where to go and always end up back at the 78 haha. I need to branch out! 

That’s incredible you started 15 years ago. Totally inspiring. You must have seen amazing changes! You’ve done the ground work for us newer vegans to have a ridiculously easy time, so thank you! 

It is definitely rewarding! We cook for my in-laws all the time, and they’re slowly realising that our food is just food, and bloody delicious food at that. It’s really great. 

I hope you loved Scotland!!"
upliftingvegan,fetzlu9,t1_fetxlfo,1579381619.0,"Oh god bloody autocorrect haha...tattoos should say tatties, which are potatoes! Preferably mashed! Neeps are turnips, usually cooked and mashed, yum! I can’t speak for every Scot but we have it a fair bit at this time of year because January 25th is Burns Day. We used to read Burns’ poem “Address to a Haggis” but now I’ve found [this](https://reddit.app.link/mdITOxXhm3)  veggie version and we like reading this one! :D"
upliftingvegan,fettw16,t1_fettiht,1579380026.0,"It is unbelievably delicious! We buy [this](https://www.macsween.co.uk/products/delicious-every-day-vegetarian/) kind, I’ve had it since I was a little kid. It is SO tasty! Especially with neeps and tattoos and a (vegan!) whisky cream sauce!

Edit: tatties!!"
vegan,fett386,t1_fetlg7l,1579379746.0,"Aww wow! The square sausage is ridiculously good. My father in law said he could not taste any difference. They also brought Greggs vegan sausage rolls for us all, and they’ve all loved the vegan chocolate cake we brought for our family member having a birthday. Two years ago she would have HATED having a “vegan” birthday cake but now she’s just like, ahhh that cake is so cute! And that’s that! It’s [this](https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/people/asda-launches-avocado-shaped-vegan-chocolate-cake-1363236) cake!"
vegan,fetsad9,t1_fet84y7,1579379442.0,Thank you! We’ve been absolutely stuffed all day haha!
vegan,fets7xv,t1_feterdg,1579379410.0,"Yeeeees...I’m aware of that. However, this particular family, two years ago, would NOT have even entertained the thought of meat replacements like the sausage, bacon, haggis and black pudding in the picture. They’d always have happily had pasta with tomato sauce or a sweet potato curry, without realising it was “VEGAN,” however trying these specifically vegan things and the other stuff we’ve made them (they’ve just finished a massive vegan pizza, and we have a vegan chocolate birthday cake in a min) would have never happened before. I’m really happy that they’ve tried and enjoyed our food, it’s great :)"
vegan,fes618n,t1_fes47en,1579361813.0,"It definitely is the quickest way to get people on board with veganism! I’m so proud to share the food I love. The only comment about realistic-ness was “you can kinda tell about the eggs, but everything else you can’t tell!!” (only KINDA!) which is bloody insanely amazing, 1) cos I thought they’d hate the tofu eggs, and 2) that they loved everything else so much! And they all had extra portions of the tofu anyway so it wasn’t a negative comment :D

Thanks so much!!"
vegan,fes2n0b,t3_eqhjyu,1579360782.0,"This from a family who branded vegan food “disgusting” a few years ago. We’re away in a wee cabin in the middle of nowhere for the weekend with only a tiny kitchen with an electric hob, so I burned a bit in an attempt to keep it all hot :( Wanted it to be perfect so that they enjoyed it and didn’t think vegan food was shit...but despite utterly cremating the vegan bacon, they loved it!! Ate tons. Seasoned the tofu with nooch, black salt, pepper, and a little bit of vegan butter and soy milk. Added turmeric for colour which was a great tip I read about in here just yesterday. Also includes vegan square sausage, fried mushrooms, potato scones, grilled tomatoes, beans...think that’s everything. My husband’s family are definitely more vegan friendly than they used to be.

If you don’t know what potato scones are, you could veganise [this](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/1219633/potato-scones) recipe, I’ve made it before and they were amazing. These were packet ones just fried up though!

worldnews,femdnmd,t1_felmkk0,1579250131.0,"I guess you know this already but for anyone else reading this, sadly animals are never allowed to [grow up.](https://twitter.com/eatveganalready/status/949717375993221120?s=20) Link shows ages of animal slaughter, no graphic content.

However, if you want to read a really gorgeous book where they ARE allowed to grow old with dignity, I highly recommend “Allowed to Grow Old,” by [Isa Leshko](https://www.isaleshko.com/allowed-to-grow-old-book). Big coffee table style book and incredibly heartwarming."
