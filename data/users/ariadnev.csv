modhelp,ff9ndl7,t1_ff9lkw6,1579716622.0,Thank you! I'm always on mobile so this is helpful to know. 😊
modhelp,ff96tsn,t3_esdbfx,1579706210.0,I'd like to know this as well. Trying to revive our mod. This might be a cute thing to do. 😊
GNVegan,ff96j0g,t1_ff94s79,1579706011.0,Aww yay! I'm glad we can support each other in our newbie-ness. 😊👍
EcoFriendly,ff96gww,t1_ff95fpj,1579705973.0,It's okay. I can always Google other sources. 😊
aww,ff92lrf,t1_ff92i37,1579703309.0,I'm very much about adopting and not buying companion animals. #adoptdontshop for sure. 😆👍
aww,ff9299g,t1_ff926i4,1579703059.0,Yes I loved it too. She just started playing with him yesterday which is when I took the photo. I think she's getting more comfortable.
EcoFriendly,ff90xnq,t1_ff8zt61,1579702062.0,I couldn't find where she talks about her natural paints. I'll keep looking. It's fine to keep to abstract if that's what you're comfortable with. There are a lot of great YouTube watercolor videos to learn how to do more nature scene. 😊
aww,ff90sli,t1_ff8zf95,1579701953.0,Thank you! I love that she lets me touch her little beans. 😆
aww,ff8yjxz,t1_ff8yh0p,1579700168.0,She's very sweet and loves to snuggle. They told us she was rescued from a hoarder. We're trying to shower her with love.
aww,ff8yg8y,t1_ff8ycv7,1579700086.0,I'm glad I'm not the only one. I thought I was biased because she's my pup. 😂
GNVegan,ff8w22n,t1_ff8vy18,1579697997.0,I've never been a mod of a sub but I'm happy to help however I can. It would be great to also make a post on the GNV sub inviting people here. Or perhaps we could change the sub to welcome vegetarians as well since a lot of folks start there in their path to veganism. It's good to welcome the spectrum. 😊
GNV,ff8v103,t1_ff4uef3,1579697041.0,Ahhh I can't believe I forgot to post about that. Thanks for doing that! They are also still looking for volunteers. 😊
GNV,ff8uxil,t3_erzsgo,1579696946.0,Done!
GNV,ff8umrl,t3_es38zc,1579696656.0,Does this image come with owner contact info? That would be most helpful in spreading the word. 😊
EcoFriendly,ff8tkip,t1_ff8nh6b,1579695577.0,"Thank you for your feedback and encouragement! Is this the artist? https://artbyjonna.com/ 

Painting with watercolors I find to be the easiest for everyone. Even if you think you can't paint. 😊"
EcoFriendly,ff7egte,t1_ff7c861,1579647670.0,Great! I found you on Instagram and am following. I'm joyelephant. 😊
GNV,ff6pd57,t1_ff5onyg,1579632087.0,Also I noticed there's a sub /r/GNVegan it hasn't been very active but if all of us who commented here join up we can get it going.
EcoFriendly,ff6okat,t1_ff5v0dv,1579631605.0,Oh those are all great ideas! Are you on Instagram as well? I liked your blog but didn't see an option to subscribe to have posts emailed to me. 😊
GNV,ff5onyg,t3_ernb2r,1579603548.0,"Hi!! I'm vegan and my husband is vegetarian but eats vegan at home. 😊

We attend a monthly vegan potluck and find it very welcoming.  Also lots of delicious foods. https://www.meetup.com/Veg4Life-Gainesville/

It's once a month. Feel free to DM as well."

I recommend checking out Donovan's videos starting with this one. He's a local realtor but also a really nice person. I reached out to him before our move and he was super helpful in narrowing down the best areas for me and my husband. He's also quick to respond if you text him. 😊 We ended up in NW Gainesville and love it here."
EcoFriendly,fee9nfg,t1_fee931i,1579029260.0,Oh that's a great idea. Didn't see the sample kit. Thank you! 😊👍
GNV,fedy3hq,t3_eocc6x,1579022330.0,"My husband and I just moved here. We're in our late 30s/early 40s. So far we've made friends through our spiritual community and secondly meetup.com has helped a lot. It helps since the meetups go by our interests. Next on my list, adopting two dogs in the spring. I've found that in our last neighborhood we made so many friends by walking around with our little dog. 😊

Putting some interests down since this thread has become a making friends possibility:

*Vegetarian/vegan
*Sober fun (we don't drink alcohol)
*Books/games (MtG, DnD, boardgames)
* Looking to get back into archery
* Arts and crafts"
EcoFriendly,fedeeig,t1_fed8nva,1579009219.0,Thanks! Have you used them? 😊
EcoFriendly,fedeczz,t1_fec6ost,1579009183.0,Wow! They have a lot available. Can you share what products you've used and your opinions? I'm looking to avoid plastic even if recycled. Thanks!
EcoFriendly,fede792,t1_febaonr,1579009047.0,Oh that's helpful. I had used newspaper before but it stained so much as you mentioned. Thanks! 😊
GNV,fe7itii,t3_enxd1c,1578915130.0,I'm brand new to Gainesville. Can someone tell me what this is and where it is exactly please? I tried googling it but I think I need a Explain it like I'm a five year old version. 😓
GNV,fdyqsxn,t1_fdx2rfl,1578782639.0,😂 I love that I'm not the only one who reads things incorrectly like that.
toastme,fdnt278,t3_emaq01,1578592265.0,"You make great quesadillas, you're an amazing cat dad, your hair is styling and you have kind eyes!! You've got this! 😊👍"
GNV,fdgpd19,t1_fdf6dag,1578404754.0,I second Hello Talk and suggest Duolingo as well. My mom is using it to improve her English (she's a native Spanish speaker) and she really enjoys how fun it is. It's a great app to supplement the classes. 😊
GNV,fdgp5gg,t1_fdgorkw,1578404584.0,Hahaha thank you! Yes just our luck that we may inspire an underground ring now. 😅
madlads,fdez66a,t1_fddqjy9,1578349718.0,Ricky keeping it real. 😂

Hope it helps and good luck to them! 😊"
GNV,fddy1h3,t1_fddwyep,1578326741.0,"Happy 🍰 day! Except for the last 24 hours which have been too cold for me, I'm enjoying it a lot. I like the quiet and in general everyone is very kind & helpful. All the nature and clean air is such a welcome change. 😊"
GNV,fddw1ed,t3_ekvfd7,1578325369.0,Aloha! Welcome to Gainesville! I'm a newbie myself. Where in Gainesville are you? 😊
GNV,fd97atw,t1_fd978y6,1578229458.0,Thank you so much! I appreciate your help. 😊
GNV,fd97308,t1_fd96f9r,1578229328.0,I have noticed a lot of people trusting their neighbors in such a way. Different from NYC for sure. 😅
GNV,fd50eih,t1_fd48z4h,1578172915.0,Thank you for sharing! I don't know why you're being down voted for sharing facts nor why my post is either. So strange. 🤷‍♀️
GNV,fd4yb88,t1_fd3odn6,1578172332.0,I didn't know Florida didn't have inspections. Interesting.
GNV,fd4y51l,t1_fd3mgkp,1578172275.0,Thank you for your reassuring response! I'm glad to hear from a local Prius owner. With my post getting down voted I wasn't sure if any Prius owners were going to out themselves. 😂
GNV,fd3dl0h,t1_fd3cgj6,1578157245.0,Thanks for the advice! I'm also looking to see if anyone has any personal experience with this type of theft in Gainesville. 😅
GNV,fd371cd,t1_fczqysa,1578155293.0,Have you tried looking on Zillow as well? 😊
prius,fd348o0,t1_fd2zzvy,1578154616.0,Good point. I'll ask our dealership about it. Thanks!
Eyebleach,fcyhk6i,t1_fcxcesf,1578080270.0,"Thank you!!! I was trying to zoom in and make out the watermark. 😆

Found her original Instagram post if anyone wants to like it and give her appreciation directly. https://www.instagram.com/p/BwAh02KgvEC/?igshid=g1auhgc0yby

She has so many cute 🦉 photos!!!"
prius,fcx97u8,t3_ej2y24,1578056143.0,I'm so sorry! That's so scary. Makes me want to set up a motion camera for the front of our house to keep an eye on our Prius. 🙁
toastme,fcpzdgj,t3_eieibn,1577875422.0,Congratulations! It's cliche but true. It all happens for a reason. I believe in you! Here's to a sober and amazing 2020! 🥳
GNV,fcfs1tn,t1_fc6k4oo,1577633224.0,"I second posting this to their Google maps reviews. I know I read those before I go out to eat.

GNV,fcfcrsx,t1_fcfbnuo,1577628698.0,I'm not on Facebook but will keep an eye for your posts on Reddit. If you set up an Instagram let me know. 😊
GNV,fcdpxvf,t1_fcb32ac,1577612403.0,It could be that it's so close to the holidays. I'm glad you'll try it on your own. Maybe you'll pick up some volunteers on site. I wonder if there's a local random acts of kindness group that may want to help or network with a local church/organization.  😊
dogs,fc9iu2g,t3_egqwiv,1577553298.0,Thank you so much for sharing this! It's good to read positive stories on here. Perhaps when you see her again you can let her know tons of internet strangers are applauding her! 😊
GNV,fc5anni,t3_eg5szb,1577451260.0,What a cute and positive idea! Please post pictures or update on how it goes for those of us who can't make it. 😊
GNV,fc2alzb,t3_efsas4,1577348853.0,Ugh that's kinda sounds horrible. This is the kind of stuff I pray to not have near me. 🙁
GNV,fbz40q6,t1_fbz3uxk,1577234408.0,Thank you so much!!! This is exactly what I needed. 😁👍
