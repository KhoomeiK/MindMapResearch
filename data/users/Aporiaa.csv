vegan,ff1z2i5,t1_ff1nsix,1579489506.0,"It really depends person to person - If you’re interested I would just start with cutting out milk/cheese and see how you do with that. 

In my case it all also causes extreme stomach discomfort, so I had to cut everything out. 

If anything start with just cutting out milk, generally that seems to be the most problematic."
minimalism,ff1xjzw,t3_epul67,1579488460.0,"I finally got my own apartment so have been really trying to curate things to fit perfectly in my space and be functional. I’m also buying nicer quality, more aesthetically pleasing items that I really love instead of settling for “just okay” items. Definitely make a list of all the things you need and take the time and care to buy ones you really like. 

This doesn’t even have to always be more expensive items. For instance, I just ordered two automatic soap dispensers for my kitchen and bathroom - just $10 each on amazon and look much more expensive and will also save me time as I won’t get water/messes on the counter trying to get soap. Those small touches really elevate a space. 

Also, get renters insurance if you’re renting! I have mine from Lemonade and it’s ~$10 a month...it takes about five minutes to sign up and you can cancel anytime."
HaircareScience,feiwgh2,t3_ep9dt5,1579149088.0,"I don’t have curly hair, but I use a round brush to dry my hair and it actually leaves my hair feeling soft unlike a blow drier that would immediately make my hair feel dry. It’s definitely worth a shot!"
AskMen,fdzq7vx,t1_fdy9f3p,1578793278.0,"Lol to answer this question though, some guys do go crazy for this. If you just sorta start at the neck and go down towards their dick, slowly kissing or gently biting on your way down it drives some guys crazy. Then once you’re down there touch and/or suck their dick for a tiny bit, then stop and go back to teasing and kissing their stomach until they get really desperate. Then proceed with a blowjob - if you do it right and they’re into that kind of thing, you’ll...be able to tell how much they like it. 

I think the first time my ex almost told me he loved me was during me doing this. He said “I love.....fucking you” when he realized what he was about to say haha."
SCAcirclejerk,fdzoxgr,t1_fdy7afc,1578792589.0,Wow - never realized that before. Surely that isn’t a coincidence lol
notmycat,fdzfv62,t3_enbwlt,1578789833.0,"Friendly cats find you, generally. I live in a super busy city so I don’t see many anymore, but the ones I have seen run right up to you for pets."

ChoosingBeggars,fdh4q3y,t1_fdgup24,1578415337.0,"Regardless, there are only 14 total places currently available on Zillow for rent under $1900 - that search included Felton, Ben Lomond, Scott’s Valley, and Boulder Creek. If someone is looking for a short term rental or a longer vacation stay for cheap, $1750 is pretty reasonable for the entire area due to how limited short term housing is in general."
ChoosingBeggars,fdh4o2b,t1_fdgurv6,1578415302.0,"Not really.

Instagramreality,fdg8amr,t1_fdg1nzj,1578384253.0,"I’m struggling to find any good example photos on Google because it’s hard to tell what’s photoshopped or what’s just bad angles. 

It was way more apparent way back in the day when she first went solo. You can see a major difference from when Destiny’s Child first came out where she had a very regular body and then all of a sudden she got a super skinny waist. She’s always had some slight lumpiness and her belly button looks like a lipo belly button to me. 

Also almost positive she had some type of butt procedure done a few years back because her body looked way curvier for the videos to her self titled album than ever before. She does go more subtle than other celebs so it’s not as noticeable."
cactus,fdg3t2b,t1_fdg0cas,1578378945.0,Oh dear god I live there I was just at that nursery a couple weeks ago lol I didn’t see the 1k euphorbia though! Curious what that looked like
Instagramreality,fdg2gra,t1_fdg28nv,1578377556.0,Lol well aren’t you a ray of sunshine!
Instagramreality,fdg0vds,t1_fdfvzfu,1578375966.0,Do you have any links to examples of success stories. Beyoncé even has lipo stomach so I’m curious what a good one looks like.
Instagramreality,fdfypq7,t1_fdfupyc,1578373979.0,"Well the sub rules disagree with you since it’s not against the rules to post non-famous people, so you’re at least a little wrong"
ChoosingBeggars,fdeieif,t1_fdehyiy,1578339685.0,I don’t know that I’d call a 350 sq foot cabin a home. My point is that the price for the square footage you get in Santa Cruz and SF are extremely comparable.
ChoosingBeggars,fdeibuv,t1_fdehc48,1578339641.0,"My point is that for someone who wanted to stay in Santa Cruz three weeks, $1750 could be a bargain. That comes out to $83/day which I imagine is far cheaper than any flea bag hotel you can find."
ChoosingBeggars,fdeggzp,t1_fde4pl0,1578338501.0,"It would be way cheaper than staying at a hotel in the area if you wanted/needed to stay longer term. It could be a good option for students looking for housing at the start of a new quarter who just need a place until they find something longer term. 

Im not saying it isn’t ridiculous, but unfortunately ridiculous is the normal in that area so it isn’t that bad of a deal for that specific housing market."
ChoosingBeggars,fdeg253,t1_fdecxnj,1578338245.0,I’m not sure what your point is? I’m talking about Santa Cruz where the listing was posted.
ChoosingBeggars,fdefu22,t1_fdeee80,1578338107.0,"They’re definitely comparable, it’s a VHCOL city- and it has a much smaller pool of homes up for grabs in a small city overrun by college students. 

I just checked Zillow and there are only 3 homes currently available for rent under $1500 and one of those is a 350 sq foot studio cabin for $1450 and a $2100 security deposit"
ChoosingBeggars,fde0flg,t1_fddu4p0,1578328356.0,Lol I agree that the security deposit is a major stretch
ChoosingBeggars,fde09bn,t1_fddnl46,1578328238.0,"Well no, absolutely not. There’s a housing shortage in the area in general and the costs for homes near the beach are astronomical, plenty of students can’t afford to live there. 

I worked as an entry level employee for the university and had to live in Aptos with my boyfriend because I couldn’t afford anything closer. Before that I was renting a bedroom with a shared bathroom for $1000 because that was the best option I could afford. 

I’m sure there are plenty of students renting rooms in homes up in the mountains as well as those houses are way cheaper than the ones on the coast. Those millionaires who now own them definitely see the potential value in renting them out for 1k a room."
HaircareScience,fdd926q,t3_ekoht7,1578300455.0,"I think I know what you mean. This happens to me too, especially during the winter for some reason. I would try a shampoo that is less stripping and get a conditioner or deep conditioner with coconut oil in it if you can. 
Coconut oil conditioner is the only thing I’ve found that really fixes this for me. 

Also use leave in conditioner and/or hair oil if it doesn’t make your hair too greasy. I personally don’t brush my hair until it’s almost completely wet, but if you want to, buy a brush specifically for in shower brushing and only brush your hair while in the shower or wait until it’s completely dry to brush."
ChoosingBeggars,fdd8oh1,t1_fdd8i2h,1578299910.0,"Well it’s definitely both of those things with a little bit of Silicon Valley tech money from Los Gatos/San Jose/etc mixed in and the fact that they refuse to build any large apartment buildings anywhere. A recipe for disaster. 

So glad I got out of that hellhole lol. Beautiful place, but only good for vacations."
ChoosingBeggars,fdd8gfv,t1_fdd5vpa,1578299588.0,"Housing costs are still the same though. Hotels in the area run anywhere from $3-500 a night in peak season. If it’s August or September you might not be able to even find a hotel, especially long term. 

It’s absolutely ridiculous, but unfortunately not a horrible deal for the area if you’re planning on staying longer than a week."

Watch this and let me know if you still feel that way"
YouShouldKnow,fcxutgh,t1_fcxtwft,1578070738.0,The headline says 60-70% of PEOPLE which is literally true globally. This is a global website - its pretty ridiculous of you to be upset that the op didn’t specifically list just the percentage for the US in the headline
AskLosAngeles,fcxoy2j,t1_fcxjodd,1578068071.0,"I’m not going to be paying 3k and I said almost 50% of my paycheck - my rents going to be coming out to about $2400, which is pretty low for a 1 bedroom apt here and it has almost everything I was looking for. 

I’m in a roommate situation now, paying $1600 for a master bedroom and having to deal with a roommate who has a crush on me and makes me uncomfortable in my own home. Not to mention not really being able to have guests over, feel uncomfortable cooking large meals or using the kitchen for extended periods of time, dealing with tandem parking, and having roommates that leave doors and windows unlocked and open while living on the first floor among many other things. 

I’m in my mid 20s now and paying the premium to have my own spot to do whatever I want and feel safe is worth it to me. I’d rather be more frugal in other ways to have an apt I look forward to going home to every day."
AskLosAngeles,fcwp1m0,t1_fcwofv7,1578032191.0,"Lol did you not just read the rest of my comment listing out how expensive it is to even share a house with roommates? The cheapest I’m going to find even a decent, safe studio apartment here is 2100, I’ve spent countless hours looking up rentals in my area in this city. 

That’s just the reality of a high cost of living city, it’s not our fault you need to make at least six figures to live here somewhat comfortably. I still save 15% of my salary and have a 6 month emergency fund so keep your condescending assumptions to yourself."
AskLosAngeles,fcw1t0q,t1_fcva2e9,1578015174.0,"I make 100k and I’m just now about to move into a nice modern 1 bedroom apt with a view. It will be almost half of my monthly salary after taxes, 401k, etc to live here and I’ll be in a not great neighborhood. 

Just a single bedroom in a shared living space costs $800 at minimum, and you will be sharing a bathroom. $1200 minimum if you want your own bathroom. You might be able to find a studio or 1 bedroom for $1500 but it will be in a not great neighborhood and not safe or will be decades old and not renovated whatsoever.

It’s pretty bleak. The only reason I moved here was because a recruiter reached out to me about a killer job and they paid all of my relocation expenses. Idk how people do it otherwise."
Youniqueamua,fcvrgi9,t1_fcvk357,1578008428.0,Lol 5.8 grams to be exact but close. In their horrible $.01 packaging. Unbelievable.
Youniqueamua,fcvg88b,t1_fcvbwmp,1578001443.0,"I felt the opposite. It looks like the full pan and the empty pan hit almost the exact same place on the sides of the container, so I feel like there’s veryyyy little bronzer in that container. 

Interestingly, I can’t find the product weights on their website lol.

Edit: According to Amazon it’s .2 oz for $32 by Younique. I just bought a bronzer literally four times that size from Marc Jacobs for $50. That means my Marc Jacobs cost $6.25/.1 oz and Younique cost $16/.1oz!!!!! They are robbing people blind."
Youniqueamua,fcvfnee,t3_ej0i0d,1578001096.0,"Is it just me or does it look like there’s a minuscule amount of product in that compact? Like the “full” one and the “empty” one look like they hit pretty much the exact same place on the sides of the pan.
 
Edit: Did some research - not surprisingly, Younique doesn’t list the product weight anywhere on their site, but according to Amazon it’s .2 oz for $32 by Younique. I just bought a bronzer literally four times that size from Marc Jacobs for $50 that comes with a mirror and a nice heavy packaging compared to that horrifically cheap Younique packaging. 

That means my Marc Jacobs cost $6.25/.1 oz and Younique cost $16/.1oz!!!!! They are robbing people absolutely blind."

AskLosAngeles,fcoheor,t1_fcnhxhp,1577832286.0,Lol more like “be realistic about your talent in a highly saturated field” which most people here don’t seem to know how to do

YouShouldKnow,fcijcfj,t1_fci0soi,1577663515.0,"Yep! It’s so frustrating. For me they’re a very distinct pimple too, that (TMI) gets filled with pus overnight so it’s easy to tell. They also take forever to go away and just ravage my skin. 

There’s no other food or cosmetic or allergy that I can correlate to it except dairy. Even using a bit of ranch dressing with fries will cause a couple pimples to pop up overnight. If I’m super rigorous with avoiding dairy I get NO pimples except for maybe 1 small red bump when I’m PMSing. 

Glad to hear I’m not alone!"

YouShouldKnow,fby8paw,t1_fbxsv64,1577210803.0,"Oat milk - specifically Oatly brand is my #1 and the closest to tasting like real milk (it’s close enough that I couldn’t tell the difference when someone actually gave me real milk in my latte a couple weeks ago and I suffered the consequences)

Flax seed milk is also really good but I only had it once and not sure what the brand was that I had."
