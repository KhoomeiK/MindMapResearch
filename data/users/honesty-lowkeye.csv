outerwilds,ffasmaz,t1_ffarx4v,1579743543.0,Controller or keyboard and mouse?
outerwilds,ffaqt90,t1_ffaq8xr,1579742327.0,"I know! That was really fun! But even the control he has over the ship *most of the time* is incredible. I don't know what was in the alpha, so for me, who went in completely blind (on PC, v1.0.1), it stopped being relatable at one point. He's just too good at it"
outerwilds,ffaptga,t1_ffan6c8,1579741660.0,"The odd thing about these playthroughs is that they never feel repetitive, whereas I had a bunch of really uninteresting loops - not for me, because I was having fun playing around with the mechanics and trying to find stuff I hadn't seen before, but they wouldn't all be fun to watch. >!It's a bit like the probe, isn't it? You're supposed to keep shooting in semi-random directions until you hit pay dirt (e.g., stuff you hadn't found/noticed before)!< These guys navigate the game beautifully"
outerwilds,ffaopv9,t1_ffamvx4,1579740923.0,"I really liked Many a True Nerd's. He named it his game of the year and hasn't finished the playthrough yet. I suspect he may have just finished it by himself and doesn't want to replay it on camera, which is perfectly fine - this game is a very personal experience."
