For example. My drive to work, there is a section on a national speed limit single carrigeway (60) and a lot of people only go 30-40 on it despite there being no hard turns and plenty of room. Even then there are only 2 sections that are safe to pass as, due to slight bends, they are the only sections where you can see far enough ahead to be able to safely pass. 90% of the time, there are cars coming so passing is a no no."
