depression,ffer7bq,t1_ffepyhm,1579861496.0,"Same here with showering. But since I don't go out much or often (unemployed and no school) I don't really need to. It's only at about lunch I go out to meet my partner (who goes first year uni) to eat. I go around in my PJ's all day some days. I went like that for a total of 4 or 5 days rather recently, but since we live with his parents I feel embarrassed and like they are judging me which both makes me stay even more in our room and helps me push myself to get dressed and shower (just came out of one actually).

I'm happy for you that you are getting help, and I know it sucks that it takes so long, but i believe in you, that you can make it. Everyone in this subreddit is able to get through this. (My partner was the most happy and positive person I ever met and it rubbed off a bit on me from being the most pessimistic person ever, still stryggle, but I try). My psychiatrist tell me over and over that it will take time, but, IT IS WORTH IT. Keep fighting, keep pushing yourself to do the smallest things.
I've tried to make myself a little achievement thing like I get a star or something in a notebook if I brushed my teeth or got out of bed, ate at least 2 meals a day etc. Gotta celebrate the small things and it feels like it's worth it.

I recognise the not leaving bed unless you *really* have to, and also with the taking a shift when you felt okay and really regretting it (summerjob that was HORROBLE as it was). It's going to be okay. Just don't push or judge yourself too hard for it.

Now get yourself ready for the tutorial at uni. And apologies for the long message. Oops.

depression,ffephf5,t1_ffepapg,1579858915.0,"I just feel bad for my partner if I don't also I hate the feeling in my mouth when I don't.
But this is my 3rd day on antidepressants so it should hopefully be getting better soon.
I hope you too are getting the help you need and deserve. Hang in there :)"
depression,ffeoyk1,t3_et5aar,1579858117.0,"I actually recently did. I usually go about at least 3 days between brushing... I'm just too tired to do it or don't have the energy to or anything. It just feels so pointless but I also don't want to ruin my teeth but I just can't sometimes...
But thanks!"

depression,fenssuh,t1_fenowgs,1579290198.0,"I have been in need for help for soon to be 10 years now and almost got there a few years ago, but was moved to adult place, but half a year late... (always been problematic and problems when it comes to me with everything to do with help) and now it costs... when you are under 18 you get help for free, now I have to pay pretty much ridiculous prices for a meeting that took 10 minutes max and didn't do shit for me, and they don't even remember what we've/they've done..."

depression,fen69ka,t1_fen4zsk,1579277898.0,"I was support to get antidepressants a few days before Christmas but still haven't gotten any, also my other medication is lowered because lack of it everywhere and it already was doing shit, and I've been on the almost lowest dose for over 2 months now, not met anyone except for checking pulse, and now I am starting to get addicted to alcohol... after only almost 2 weeks of being old enough to buy... I have a collection..."
depression,femt0az,t3_epvzb0,1579268761.0,"The problem is that I can't enjoy the things I enjoy... because it feels like I am skipping doing things I should and need and have to do... also because things in e.g. the series, movies, books etc. reminds me of stuff or simply just make me more depressed. Which is literally what just happened 5s ago before writing this..."

Edit: took away my apology because this is definitely a repost  I checked."
depression,fcg7iua,t3_eh2g5i,1577637208.0,"I have felt since age 5-6 or so, when I tried to hang myself with the string/rope from my mirror (yes, at age 5 and a half I tried to kill myself already), that I don't belong here, I was never supposed to be born.
And ever since then I have felt I should've died then or at any point since then. I have tried to drown myself, suffocate (though not fully hang myself, never gotten the opportunity) and I have OD'd. I have always felt I should have tried harder, I should have died whilst crossing the road or whatever. But I am still here...
I am better and haven't had the urge to kill myself for some time now, but I still feel and think sometimes ""Why am I here? No one wants me here anyways, not really. I should have died. YEARS AGO."""
depression,fceazb3,t3_egzqgq,1577618745.0,"I did the same just the other day. But don't judge yourself too hard for doing so, then you fall in the trap and get into a bad circle.
I am going to try to make 2020 completely cut-free, my 2019 has been pretty much so because my boyfriend is very supportive and didn't get mad when I did cut myself whilst my parents always start a rage and in short made everything so much worse, so I kept lying to them about it."
depression,fc51i8q,t3_efyc5z,1577438287.0,"Definitely not alone. This is how I got into 4 bad relationships in which I got used and mistreated and shit, which caused just more depression.
I just jumped into the relationships and never even had one single date with someone before entering the relationship, I had nothing on them, knew nothing about them... I just didn't want to be alone, I can't handle being alone. I didn't have friends either, only short time and not fully...
But with my current boyfriend I had had a crush on him for 2 years and been mistreated enough and was so depressed etc I felt ""how could it get worse"" and started talking to him and some others, got friends, hung out with him, he taught me Magic The Gathering and we hung out several hours every day for a month and even went on a date before I finally dared to enter his home, lied on his chest and cuddled for about 3 hours before he asked me ""Will you be my girlfriend?"" And we have been together for 1+year now and he is the best I've ever had, thr nicest person I've ever met  most patient.
I just feel bad with my depression which causes me to be down pretty much all the time and extremely irritable...

So, my word of wisdom to you is to get to know whomever you have a crush on before getting into the relationship. It is better to be sad alone then jumping into relationships unknowingly and probably get mistreated and used...
Stay safe put there."
dadjokes,fc2rw7h,t3_efva5h,1577372234.0,My boyfriend told me this before we became a couple. In high school...
depression,fbur7qk,t3_eeh20j,1577119071.0,"That was just very sucky of that person...
I don't know exactly what you told them, but from their view it might've just been too much all at once. Did you know her well? And do you work/go to school together or something? If so you could ask what it was all about and hopefully remain friends at least.
Wish you the best and please update if you hear from her."
