aww,feclshq,t1_feclrib,1578977069.0,Definitely similar but just seems a little off
aww,feclnjy,t1_fechhna,1578976972.0,I don’t believe so. I have family that lives on grand lake and this doesn’t seem like it
aww,feclann,t3_eodytg,1578976717.0,Well that’s my new wallpaper

Damnthatsinteresting,fe0kubp,t1_fe0egpw,1578815203.0,I didn’t know what that meant till seeing your comment. Interesting because yesterday I found three $10 .999% silver coins from 3 different casinos in my stuff.
toptalent,fdud1be,t1_fdsag6e,1578731319.0,I don’t understand your comment. Maybe I’m just dumb but those words in that order are confusing to me
toptalent,fducjgj,t1_fdsfpp0,1578731196.0,"The difference is that I could curl for the first time ever tomorrow and probably be Olympic level in a few weeks. This sport on the other hand isn’t even playable for most people. I’m joking about the curling comment btw, I’m sure it’s harder than it looks."
toptalent,fduc6jm,t1_fdspoer,1578731026.0,Yeah you kinda nailed it. I wouldn’t have thought of it on my own but I clicked immediately when I read your comment.
toptalent,fduc3ax,t3_emw6tl,1578730980.0,This is not impressive
GameSale,fdplxq6,t1_fdpkwxz,1578632339.0,Sorry about that. Wasn’t trying to ignore you. I’m so sorry the first guy I was talking to I thought fell through but ended up sending the money. Im really sorry for wasting your time.
GameSale,fdplus8,t1_fdplq90,1578632270.0,Ok sorry about that. It’s hard to check all the rules on my phone because I can only have one thing open at a time so I can’t reference it
GameSale,fdphsb2,t1_fdph75k,1578628984.0,Sorry I’m not home yet and the code is at home. I’ll be there in about 30 mins and then I’ll message ya. I’m talking to one other person but if they fall through I’ll be down
GameSale,fdph94z,t1_fdph0de,1578628577.0,For sure. I appreciate it
GameSale,fdpgmln,t1_fdpg7ht,1578628108.0,Shit I thought I replied to you but it sent a separate comment
GameSale,fdpglw0,t3_eml3h0,1578628093.0,"Ok I’ve got one other person I’m talking to but if he falls through, I’m game. I’ll be home in about 45 minutes and I’ll be wanting to do it ASAP once I do. I would do it now but I just realized the code is at home"
GameSale,fdpfnjg,t1_fdpfmkp,1578627392.0,"If you send first, I’m ok with that."
GameSale,fdpeu0r,t3_emjj2u,1578626803.0,I have 50 psn. I know it’s not exactly what you said but it could get games and membership

GameSale,fdpauvo,t1_fdp6ru2,1578624050.0,I’m not seeing any transactions unfortunately
GameSale,fdpap9m,t1_fdp6ru2,1578623944.0,Yeah that should be fine
Assistance,fdp4zib,t1_fdp4vjc,1578620121.0,"Thank you. I joined all the local groups and haven’t had any luck. And unfortunately time is a bit of an issue. I get paid in 8 days but I can miss work and school till then. But i suppose if I can’t do anything, I can’t do anything."
GameSale,fdp4tfy,t1_fdot6dz,1578620010.0,Sadly no. I’ve only made I think 2 transactions on Reddit at this point and I’m not exactly Reddit marketplace savvy so I didn’t think to worry about it.
Assistance,fdp4qph,t1_fdp48v6,1578619959.0,Sadly yes it seems to be. They range from $125-$160 not counting core fee but I’d return mine when I purchased it. I have a little cash to put towards it though so i only need about $100 now
Assistance,fdp4bls,t1_fdp48v6,1578619680.0,That is true. Let me look some more and see. Maybe I could find a used one
Assistance,fdp1vwk,t3_emgjjw,1578618024.0,I need anything I can get to help me pay for a new car battery so I can get to work and college which I’m starting on Monday. I understand if you choose someone else though. It’s very nice of you to do this.
Assistance,fdowaam,t1_fdoqkpc,1578614328.0,Thank you I actually tried that but it only helped for about a day. After that my car would literally be completely dead the second I turned my car off

gaming,fcuy5hs,t1_fcuw4a6,1577990862.0,For sure. Once I got to the age where I had a lot of responsibilities I kinda gave up on games like that and now I almost exclusively play single player games. Mostly RPGs and stuff like that. Currently playing breath of the wild
gaming,fcuxmjd,t3_ej0qnk,1577990573.0,I would actually not raid him. Just because I feel his pain and I feel for him.
TumblrInAction,fc2pbpi,t1_fc1ak0p,1577369958.0,Lol this couldn’t have been said better. It really is so annoying that they act like they haven’t been living in the actual world this whole time

instant_regret,fc29sz6,t1_fc28wru,1577347516.0,Yeah I have the same situation. It’s thin but there is a lot of it. I don’t mind really. It is definitely low maintenance and it looks fine. It could be much worse lol

instant_regret,fc27bmy,t1_fc278p4,1577343752.0,"Yeah similar situation. I have hope as well. I basically have my mom’s exact hair. Fairly fine and with some curls. Quite a lot of hair, just wish it was a little thicker instead of so fine. Limits options for cut styles."
instant_regret,fc26b1n,t1_fc236e7,1577342357.0,Propecia is said to work for many but the side effects tend to be a little tougher from the sound of things. Many people say that your soldier won’t be so eager to salute when taking it.
instant_regret,fc263c5,t1_fc22utw,1577342070.0,They say you get your hair from your moms dad. Sadly I’ve never met my moms dad so I have no idea what his hair is like. I’m 30 now and going strong so I’m hoping that means I’ll be good. Been getting grays since high school though so it’s definitely not perfect.

instant_regret,fc25h17,t1_fc1rdrd,1577341274.0,Oh it’s a phone? I thought it was a Tom Tom...
unpopularopinion,fc254df,t1_fc23rxb,1577340829.0,Yeah that’s probably a big part of it. But it’s hard to say since everyone’s family is different and different areas have different norms.
unpopularopinion,fc252bk,t1_fc24ypo,1577340759.0,lol I love sweet tea with extra lard
unpopularopinion,fc245zi,t1_fc1yl96,1577339690.0,I just feel like it’s hard to get all the necessary nutrients for a growing child on a vegan diet. Especially as a child who is more likely to be picky and less educated on dietary needs. Possibly even less educated than a mother who’s forcing her child to be vegan....
unpopularopinion,fc23se5,t1_fc1x9hj,1577339251.0,Eating vegan isn’t necessarily that healthy for a young kid that needs nutrients. And that is forcing them because the kids don’t know anything about nutrition. “Raising them to be” in this context is just a nicer sounding way of saying “forcing them”
unpopularopinion,fc22irb,t1_fc20cog,1577337816.0,His comment is just fueled by disagreement? And what was the comment you’re sticking up for fueled by?
unpopularopinion,fc22d83,t1_fc1ergk,1577337652.0,"You hit the nail right on the head. Very well said and your statement was very accurate. It’s not because she’s vegan, it’s because she a rotten piece of garbage."
unpopularopinion,fc223vq,t1_fc1uc1b,1577337374.0,"It probably depends on the type of meal. If it’s a home cooked meal with one main dish and a few sides, they’d probably be able to eat at least one side but the main dish is likely meat or contains meat. And just eating a side dish or two may be boring. A vegan on the other hand probably would have a much bigger struggle."
unpopularopinion,fc21ylx,t1_fc20z7o,1577337217.0,That’s absurd. Why the hell wouldn’t he? If it’s a newborn that means he hasn’t even known it for long and the kid obviously wouldn’t remember him. And you’d have to deal with the chick who is clearly a skanky hoe.
unpopularopinion,fc21w57,t1_fc1tn1v,1577337144.0,Fudge those people. Yeah you can go one meal without meat. But you don’t have to just to make some douche happy. That’s so annoying.
unpopularopinion,fc21su6,t1_fc1q24n,1577337046.0,I feel like cool vegans (such as your friends) probably have the douche obnoxious vegans more than anyone else because it makes them look bad. I could be wrong though. I’d assume the majority of them are probably reasonable people. And you just hear about the annoying ones which makes them seem more common.
unpopularopinion,fc21ita,t1_fc1mdc9,1577336755.0,I think that’s because of the stereotype that every vegan has to work the fact that they’re vegan into every conversation they have. So the non-douchey ones are probably hyper aware of that fact and don’t want to be perceived that way. Vegans are so commonly disliked because of those over the top ones. But obviously there is nothing at all inherently wrong with being vegan. Just don’t be an imposition.
unpopularopinion,fc213b3,t3_efmdpp,1577336301.0,"Preach. Being a vegan is totally fine obviously but don’t talk like you’re better than everyone. And don’t expect everyone to live their lives to fit your needs.

Edit: just read the rest of your post. That lady seems like a real grade A piece of trash. She should be kissing your grandmothers feet for being so kind and accommodating. I don’t think I could be a vegan for the simple fact that I’d feel like it’s such an imposition. It’s one thing to bring your own food or just eat what suits your diet. But to expect others to shop for you AND MAKE THEM THROW AWAY EVERYTHING NON VEGAN is absolutely absurd and anyone that would request that is a garbage person. No offense but your dad also majorly sucks for thinking that’s acceptable and for dating this person in the first place. He should’ve left her in the dumpster where she belongs."
OldSchoolCool,fbwbklu,t1_fbvsm7i,1577145624.0,"Robin Williams was by far the worst one to me. I grew up with his movies. Hook and mrs doubtfire were two of my all time favorites. Also Aladdin, jumanji, patch Adams, good will hunting. And so many more. He was the best."
