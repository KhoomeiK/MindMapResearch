JoeRogan,fgv16qo,t1_fguij7m,1581134271.0,Well there was a massive vendetta against him during his lawsuits with TMG. I don’t know if TMG actually screwed Depp out of money or not but all of Hollywood seemed to be against him and that included the media. Was pretty easy between 2017-2019 to call Depp a washed up lunatic. His problems were bigger than just money apparently and he deserves at least a little compassion I think. The man’s ramped up substance use sure matches a timeline in which he was apparently being abused pretty frequently while also under enormous financial strain and public ridicule. Has to be hard to go through that after being so loved by everyone for many years. He doesn’t get a full pass on his own actions but some context and a little nuance would be nice.
worldnews,fguxabq,t3_f0il56,1581131518.0,"“Fuck the Dems” even when it means eroding our democracy using very fascist tactics. Intimidating witnesses, threatening to put whistleblowers, and now firing employees for telling the truth. How can you be okay with this even for your “team”? So much pent up anger turned into complete psychosis in this country."
nba,fgusx27,t3_f0hn0f,1581128689.0,Fire gar pax for real. I haven’t watched the bulls in 6 years because of these two idiots. They got super lucky on a couple of picks and trades then mismanaged the team and ruined our potential by fucking it up in so many ways. A blind dog could have picked up Derrick Rose you don’t get an award for doing that.
JusticeServed,fgumfhg,t1_fgtlsh9,1581124419.0,Happy to do so!
trashy,fgpqonk,t1_fgppqpw,1581010135.0,I always think it’s great to see people with Aspergers who embrace it and have a good sense of humor about being “labeled”. My cousin has Aspergers and I think it’s great that it’s a term that’s being reclaimed a bit. You probably don’t care but I think it’s cool. Thought your name was funny. Thanks for sharing.
politics,fgpazez,t1_fgp3v5m,1581001048.0,I’ve never donated either but I get a sick feeling in my stomach just thinking about the utter disgusting nonsense Trump gets away with every day that would have never stood before. I’ve voted Republican more times than democrat but this time I donated to Bernie because another establishment candidate isn’t strong enough of a message to the world and not big enough of a step for America. We deserve better and if We have to force a bunch of people into a better life while they are crying about communism and America First Family Values lies and rhetoric so be it. I’ll still vote for anyone but Trump and so will my family of life long Republicans. We’re disgusted.

trashy,fgp0z9u,t1_fgp04hs,1580993782.0,They have become way too popular too quickly. Every stay at home mom with an SUV has one in my community.
JusticeServed,fgozeku,t1_fgoh873,1580992767.0,Yes but you used semantics to create a different argument “self defense” than what you clearly know I’m talking about. You went on a big long rant about self defense and honestly the whole thing was pretty disingenuous and not in the spirit of my comment. If we’re talking about just “self-defense” now in the strictest sense of avoiding fights and not getting hurt at all cost sure. Congrats you schooled us all grandmaster on how to pick apart words to miss the meaning behind what was said. Mom would be so proud. People running around trying to be technically right through semantics is one of the worst things about Reddit.
worldnews,fgofnqg,t3_ezku53,1580968336.0,Can we just elect Mitt. I honestly don’t give a fuck I just want Trumps corrupt ass gone. I don’t know how we ever fell for this shit it’s embarrassing as hell. I’m in shock every day the stupid shit I hear repeated without a single critical thought in support of Trump. Sure has opened my eyes though. Of course I want some real systemic change but I think the 1% would stage Bernie’s death before they’d let him get elected AND pass meaningful legislation.
