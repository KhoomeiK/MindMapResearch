Forget the career prospects and, if you love it, you will find a way. However, if you choose IT just because the salary or the job opportunities you will fail, as you will be doing the rest of your life things you don’t really love. And there is a long way until retirement."

Look, you can be feminine or masculine and to dress the way you want but, even if you are a straight guy or girl, acting as if you were a crazy teenager when you are, in fact, a grown adult, is stupid. Nothing to do with being homosexual. However, I found out that many homosexuals behave like this (they really have to force their behaviors or the way they are just to make sure everybody know or to proof they are homosexuals).

You are homosexual? Cool! You are trans? Fine, no problem. You want to overreact and overact everything just to show you are homosexual? Then you have a problem."
unpopularopinion,ff8o2dg,t1_ff8nj8y,1579688295.0,"Ok, I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT TRANS.

I’m talking about BEHAVIORS!!

How you BEHAVE. You can wear whatever the f*** you want. If you think the risk is worth (the risk of some stupid people beating you because the way you look, etc.) go ahead. I don’t care and I’m not talking about trans.

I’m talking about how homosexual people BEHAVE just to prove they are homosexuals."
unpopularopinion,ff8mvhx,t1_ff8mfiu,1579686479.0,"What are you talking about? It’s not that difficult: you are a dude that likes males. That’s fine. Now, you don’t need to act as a crazy teenager female shouting and behaving as if you just turned 15. It’s not that difficult to understand, is it?"

You don’t need to act as a crazy teenager female student being a 35yo male just to prove others that you are Homosexual (for example). That’s what I mean."
unpopularopinion,ff5nete,t1_ff5m8a1,1579601657.0,"Your point is valid. However, I wouldn’t mind to talk about anything related to that matter. And I don’t mind he/she acting the way they feel confident. What I don’t like is overreacting.

You see guys with 40 years old that are gays and they act as if they were 15 years old crazy teenagers. THAT is what I don’t like."
unpopularopinion,ff5kyll,t3_ehe5gp,1579597904.0,"I don’t care if my son or daughter are homosexual as far as he doesn’t act as a crazy bitch and she doesn’t act as if she was a truck driver (if you know what I mean).

My main point is that you do not need to change your sex using surgery, become a crazy bitch (if you are a male) or a truck driver (for females) to show others that you are homosexual.

You can dress the way you like, but I’m talking  about the behavior. People think they have to behave like the most feminine (overreacting, shouting, etc.) or masculine (spitting on the floor, being rude, etc.) possible way to show that they are homosexual.

So, as far as my children are not like that, they can be whoever they want. I don’t care at all."
