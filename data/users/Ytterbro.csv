worldpolitics,ffh9vxx,t1_fffen6r,1579927364.0,"I personally feel that everyone has the right, and should have the right, say what they want, whenever, wherever. Regardless of what the content is. The simple fact is we will never progress as a society if we keep hiding ideas away, it didn't work when we burned books, and it won't work censoring people irl or online. It is only through the voicing of these absolutely horrendous ideas that people will see the faults in it. 

We deserve it to one another to allow our ideas to be expressed freely. Even when those ideas sting, even when those ideas make us feel that humanity is doomed. I do not think anyone with the right mind believes in the extremities in society, far left or right.  So why should we fear the ideas of idiots?"

conspiracy,ff0zq5s,t1_ff0hpxk,1579473826.0,"How would one even develop a study to discern the cause of autism and its linkage to vaccines? You cannot say bluntly vaccines cause autism and then look at patient histories. You need to have a direct pathway of HOW. And yes, small sample sizes are inherently flawed. 


But you're missing the biggest part of the arguement here. If there were substate to the arguements being g presented there would be independent studies, thousands of scientists, flocking to it. There would be more to the arguement than a handful of doctors, and a few crackpots arguing this. 


Let's say you're 100% right. Assuming that vaccines cause autism, what is the alternative? Is there an alternative? Worse yet, would anyone argue that say Measles is better than autism? In a world where vaccines do cause autism, 99.99% of the time it would be better than the diseases they protect against."
conspiracy,fezqa0q,t1_fex62ax,1579460296.0,"Absolutely, however you are working from a flawed premise. Real research isn't expensive... atleast not to the person in question here. She owns her own practice, a substantial revenue influx. So she could possibly fund a small scale study and go from there. To this point, according to her CV, she did no undergrad, grad, or post grad research into the field. 

Unfortunately, hearing both sides is what we have done. The numbers show that vaccinations, as a whole, work well. The misconception about scientists are that they are easily swayed by corporations (some are agenda pushers), but for the most part that is untrue.  Scientists are swayed by data, hard numbers, conclusive evidence and nothing more. Scientists are chomping at the bit to disprove one another, in favor for their own theory, all the time. Peer review through publications are not the end all be all of science, that is true, but it is enough to start looking into it. 


So until such a time when papers are released, with data supporting the claim, and reproducible results, the stance will stay strong in my eyes."

conspiracy,fex22zs,t1_few71k6,1579423055.0,"You are not understanding me.

An individual can be educated a myriad of different means. And their knowledge of any given area is directly related to the number of hours they spend researching it. This person is educated, and is knowledgeable in that medical field, not up for debate. 


Any person can make claims about any subject, but since subjects like vaccines are very nuanced it is important to discriminate between educated claims, and uneducated ones. When you spend hundreds of thousands of hours studying the violin you are not qualified on all strings. Sure other instruments may come easier, and you'll understand the commonality between all musical instruments, but that doesn't mean you are the master of music. So it is important when transitioning from one instrument to another there is a clear cut trail for your education. Either through formal, or informal education, they must be documented and some form accreditation.

Any claim MUST be backed by evidence, that evidence must be reproducible, with a clear correlation. That is why peer reviewed papers are a MUST for any substantial  claim. So if you are arguing against a mountain of evidence, your claim must be backed with it's own amount of evidence. Not only that but that claim must be reproducible, well documented, and peer reviewed. 


Tl;dr (cause you won't): For a person to be an authority on a subject, they should have done accredited research, or formally study in that subject. Without that there is no way to evaluate their claims. Without peer review, research is moot."
conspiracy,fevv0kc,t1_fevqk6p,1579401864.0,"Absolutely not. I am saying that getting a doctorate in field A means you are an expert in field A. If you plan on learning or writing books in field B, you should have tangible evidence to support your studious endeavors in field B. 


Take literally any other field of study and this makes sense. A person with a degree in electrical engineering is not really an authority on trusses and arch design. Sure they may have a lot of overlapping studies, and it's not impossible to study to adjacent fields, but it is unlikely. Moreover if you want to study a different field, you should have degrees/fellowships/academic peer reviewed papers/internships to show that you are qualified to discuss such things."

conspiracy,fetrm5y,t1_fetor6w,1579379034.0,"That's not a valid argument. Obviously neither of us do, even so that doesn't mean we cannot evaluate her claims. Even with her extensive CV she doesn't appear to have enough knowledge on the subject matter."
conspiracy,fetrct9,t1_fetoipm,1579378844.0,"Oh she is absolutely nutty, we are in agreement. However I'm not sure she did go PreMed. I'm pretty sure premed results in a BS. I know, atleast from what I've seen, premed stop at Org 2. My assertion, and I dont think we could prove either way without pulling her school records, is she could have floated by with a BA and then transitioned into a 4 year program. If my uni was anything to go on the premed track got you Biochem I and Org II, which may be sufficient to learn the jargon and nothing more.

Even still my point is that the degree she holds does not qualify her to talk on the subject. DOs don't study microbology long term, nor biochem, which was my original hangup."

Is it transphobic to not want a trans sexual partner? No. Sexual preference is not a choice.

Is it wrong/bad to be a trans person, questioning, or a member of the LGBTQ? No. Sexual preference is not a choice.

Is it rape when you are having sex with a trans person, who doesn't inform you prior? No, but it's certainly a scummy thing to do. It should be disclosed as a part of consent, but it is not on par with rape. If you purposely withhold that information, be it in spite, or fear, you are either a coward, a piece of shit, or both. Some might view that on the same teir as rape.


Thankfully this thread also shows, for the most part, that the trans community feels similarly. And for that we really  should thank them. While I do not identify in the LGBTQ, and do not find transgender people compatible with me, I do sincerely thank those who disclose it.
