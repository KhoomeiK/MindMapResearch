TwoXChromosomes,fefutrd,t1_fefbm76,1579065908.0,"Yeah - I get this, but it’s not always that easy. My friend has a heart condition that will kill her if she gets pregnant. Due to the heart condition she doesn’t work. She can’t take hormonal birth control because of the heart condition, so she’s using an IUD. The IUD lasts 5 years. Over the course of the 5 years her husband got a new job with new healthcare benefits. The IUD is no longer covered. Since it’s a 1 salary household, money runs thin. The IUD is now $1300.  

She did try to appeal it and explain that this is a life and death scenario if she got pregnant but nope, it’s birth control. It’s not fair for even private companies to dictate health related issues. They don’t care about anything but #1"
TwoXChromosomes,fefta3v,t1_fefanc8,1579064529.0,"Similar to my friend. She has a heart condition that will kill her and the baby if she got pregnant. Doctors do not want her getting a hysterectomy because she hasn’t had a kid yet. Even though she will literally die if she has biological children, she’s had multiple doctors refuse to let her get a hysterectomy because she hasn’t had kids and she’s in her early 30s. Also multiple doctors have asked her if her husband is aware that she’s interested in one, even though it could be a matter of life and death for her. 

Also, her insurance did not cover her birth control. if she takes the less expensive route with hormonal birth control, it will mess with her heart and she could die. So she payed out of pocket $1300 for an IUD. 

Our health care policies have utterly failed her. And it’s heart wrenching to see how much men’s voices are heard over women’s voices when it comes to women’s health concerns."
