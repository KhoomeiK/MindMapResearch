Futurology,fem3m30,t1_fekk3n6,1579238635.0,I disagree. Have you seen the opened back panel and battery of a non-removable battery phone? It is exactly the same as a removable one. It does not make them more smaller/performant (that doesn't sound like an actual word)/integrated. The only difference is - in one the back panel is easily removable and in one it isn't.
