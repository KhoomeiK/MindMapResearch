FragileWhiteRedditor,ffynk7f,t1_ffymlx8,1580350665.0,"That’s just victim blaming with more words. You’re just saying that if someone’s offended by some disgusting thing you’ve said that it’s their fault. There’s no nuance here. If it hits the same for everyone outside your group. And the racist people who’ve infiltrated your group can’t tell the difference either, it means that there’s not special sauce. It’s just the same thing."

FragileWhiteRedditor,ffyhvg3,t1_ffygpgx,1580346800.0,"None of that made sense. You haven’t made any clear arguments defending your point at all. You clearly don’t understand what the burden of proof means. When you make jokes that hit exactly the same as common racism to the general public, it means you’re indistinguishable, and the results are as well. You’re being condescending by pretending you’re in on some kind of secret joke. Your actions are destructive, and it will catch up to you."

trashy,ffygn2m,t1_ffyf3xt,1580345963.0,"There’s very little of that in the US. And it varies state to state. Blue states do a lot better at protecting the employee. Red states do a lot worse and frame the laws that hurt the most in buzzwords.

FragileWhiteRedditor,ffy9xbf,t1_ffxyyw2,1580341449.0,"You haven’t shown anything. What you’re saying is akin to coming into a mixed audience and telling us all the earth is flat, or 1+1=3. And then telling us we need to provide proof that it isn’t.

People within your in group can’t tell the difference, and commingle with racists, and it says something about you. Not the other way around."
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffxwc7a,t1_ffxuhtl,1580333706.0,"You’re misunderstanding. The burden of proof is on you.

Deplatforming works. If the folks within your group can’t properly tell the difference it means the system isn’t working.
You haven’t demonstrated anything."
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffxstrg,t1_ffxs8wg,1580331726.0,"You've twisted the logic a bit. The burden of proof is on the one telling the joke, not the audience. And if, even within your small group, many people can't tell the difference and are just enjoying the overt racism, then the irony, or joke of it isn't working as a joke, and is indistinguishable.

And nobody really cares if you enjoy it or hang out with racists. Intent doesn't come into it. It's about execution. If it looks and sounds the same as some overt racism to the point that even the people within your intended audience enjoy it as such, then the joke just just racism.

Furthermore, I'm not telling you to stop. I don't care either way. I think punching down is in poor taste though. And if it is about making 'jokes,' you guys need to develop a better schema like what they've done with gamingcirclejerk where there's a flag to denote jokes, instead of everyone leaning into it hard and blurring the line to the point where it's indistinguishable."

WTFgaragesale,ffxrmep,t1_ffxr7tg,1580331054.0,"Could be something like that. My mom had some pretty fun stories about working with her at a jewelry store. Like one time, the place got robbed by a dude in a large trench coat, with a little person inside the coat. The little person opened the back of the coat, unlocked one of their front pillar display cases, and took everything inside, and then they walked out. They only found out because they checked the cameras that night when they had lost inventory.

FragileWhiteRedditor,ffxkjkg,t1_ffxj37t,1580327008.0,"What he was saying is that if the humor can't be understood outside the small narrow group, and can't be used in a mixed group or in public, or in your office casually with your boss. Then it will have the same result as the overt racism, and loses its meaning as any kind of 'irony.'"
lotrmemes,ffxk9qi,t1_ffxj983,1580326849.0,"Yea, I understand. It wouldn't have made sense given Tolkein's background. But to be more like our own world, it could've made sense to add an element of it to things. It would've colored the motives differently though, and changed the complexity of the heroe's journey."
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffxhqa6,t1_ffxha6n,1580325385.0,"I think one of the larger issues is that the racists, and those young folks using the sub who are too stupid to know any better are part of the intended public. Which means that the jokes aren't actually landing as intended for the intended group.
Your 'in crowd' can't tell the difference, and it sometimes just devolves into a bunch of overt racist jabs, or misogyny, so how could you expect anyone unfamiliar with the flimsy intentions of the place to distinguish it as a joke?"
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffxgfkj,t1_ffxg6vr,1580324635.0,"but if the results are indistinguishable, then it's not a problem with the wider audience. That's what he's trying to say. Calling a black person hard R, and telling them that it's a joke isn't going to land well. And it's not because it's some edgy dark humor, it's because of the historical connotation of the word. You don't live in a vacuum and pretending that you do doesn't reflect poorly on the wider world."

FragileWhiteRedditor,ffxf75w,t1_ffxegqd,1580323921.0,"His argument is that if you went to a public space, around a mixed group of people who you're not completely familiar with, and aren't all ""in"" on the joke, and told this ""joke,"" they wouldn't be able to tell the difference between it and just overt racism. There has to be a punch line or follow up for it to be a joke. Some subversion of your expectations that make everyone understand that you're not just being horrible. Like with what Dave Chappelle was doing with his sketches. The black man being part of the KKK is a joke. A white man talking about how black people are inferior isn't a joke. Does that makes sense? I'm having trouble believing your arguing in good faith, since every comment you make just makes it seem like you're ignoring the points given. ""Bait/trolling"" isn't a joke. It's typically just the overt racist without any punchline attached with plausible deniability. It's actually a well documented tactic of the alt-right used on stormfront back when that was a website. Were you familiar with that website? There's a whole wikipedia article about it that you're welcome to look up."

FragileWhiteRedditor,ffx50jc,t1_ffvcohd,1580317880.0,"He’s asking what the joke is. What makes it funny as opposed to just overt racism.

Jokes that deal with racism have some form of bait and switch that make them work as a joke and subvert expectations. If they don’t, then they’re just racism for the sake of it, and that’s not really a joke.

He’s asking you to explain where the joke is. He’s given you a link to it, so you can go look at it and give us an analysis to defend your point with a specific example as opposed to a nebulous hypothetical defense.
