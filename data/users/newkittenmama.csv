I’m with them both most of the day every day because that’s just how my work schedule has been. So he’s around me a lot more than his dad since his dad does more work even after he gets done with his main job. Which is why we have been so close lately and why the sudden behavior change took me by surprise. I will try to spend some one on one time with him when I get back. He even still sleeps on my lap, but the second I get up and start walking around, he starts his hissing, occasionally with aggressive poses."

cats,febmsi7,t1_fea81yl,1578960521.0,She sure is feisty!!
cats,fdivp3p,t1_fdiuq6x,1578452096.0,"Yes, definitely. It’s good to have this advice. I took her yesterday. At that point, it had maybe been 1 or 2 days with diarrhea. The vet said my kitten looked and felt healthy. So I’m hoping it continues that way. 

I had to give her a bath today because she managed to get poop everywhere. All over her tail and paws and head. It was kind of impressive. But she was not happy with me or the situation. I’m definitely going to have scars from that adventure. But at least she’s not covered in poop!"
cats,fdiudi5,t1_fditz5m,1578451243.0,Very good advice! We don’t have any houseplants. So it’s definitely not that. But it is possible that they ate a bug or something. I’m home with them most days. So I’m very closely monitoring their behaviors. I’m really hoping they just get better. It’s stressing me out.
cats,fdiu00z,t1_fditt7z,1578451004.0,"I really hope so. If not, I don’t know what to do. The vet doesn’t seem to know what to do. At least they are staying hydrated. Hopefully it passes on its own."
cats,fdisrhs,t1_fdisksk,1578450220.0,They both tend to eat each other’s dry food. We let them free feed throughout the day but we separate them when we give them wet food. So they very well may be reacting to the same food. We just don’t know which. The vet said that it shouldn’t cause an issue if they are eating each other’s food as long as our adult isn’t gaining weight and our kitten is eating mostly her kitten food.
cats,fdirz9w,t1_fdirlyy,1578449718.0,"We haven’t opened any new bags recently. We just finished off our older cat’s bag of food but haven’t added any of the new stuff. And the we are a little over halfway through the kitten’s bag of food. 

They can’t access the bathroom trash. And the main trash has a revolving lid, and I don’t think they’ve made it into that. The kitten wouldn’t be able to get out. And the cat hasn’t shown any interest in it at all. 

I have given the kitten a couple new treats, which I could definitely see being the cause of her problems. I won’t be giving her any more any time soon. We are going to just do their normal food. But the older cat won’t even touch those treats. So I know for sure he’s never even tried them."
