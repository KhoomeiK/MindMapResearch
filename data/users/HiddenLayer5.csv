> We believe that marriage and sex is between a man and a woman and that doing otherwise is a sin.

Why is an all powerful God offended by what two consenting adults do in the privacy of their own homes again? Something that does not harm anyone else in the slightest?

> If my child's faith is swayed by a middle school science teacher then he didn't have strong faith to begin with.

Tell that to the lobbyists that want evolution banned from textbooks.

> A living being would have been born if that baby wasn't aborted.

If that's your criteria, would it not apply to a sperm and egg before fertilization too? Yet women kill an egg every month and even during sex with every intention to conceive, men kill millions of sperm.

> Also most abortions are for convenience. ""I'm not ready."" ""I'm just a kid.""

What's your point? Especially the ""I'm just a kid"" part. You really think it's a good idea to force a *kid* to go through pregnancy and labor, something infamously dangerous even with modern medicine?

> The exception I can think of is maybe rape but you should put the child up for adoption at least.

Just this point alone. I can't even visualize how utterly traumatizing being a rape victim is, and you want to tell them to ""deliver your rapist's child""? Most women who *wanted* a baby will say that labor is one of the most painful things they've ever endured, so why not slap some mental harm to that too, huh?"

It's not a child if it's unborn. The definition of the ""child"" stage of human life starts at birth and ends either somewhere in the early teens or all the way until 18 years old depending on the context. 

Also, it's interesting how Christians just skim over the fact that abortion is also done in cases of women getting impregnated through rape, if they are far too poor to support a child (which I say is also inhumane for the child), if there are complications that can endanger the woman's life, or if the fetus has a severe defect that will make its life miserable. Also, people who would get abortions without hesitation would probably also know to put on a condom.

> They want marriage, and then it's socially engineered into our children through television, and then as you all love to say, it is shoved down the throats of our children.

Exactly, yet you condemn anyone who has a different definition of marriage."
