That said, surely the source of information isn't as important as the quality of it? If someone from Italy had a video of Trump or Sanders bashing minorities would you dismiss it because they were from Italy?"

Stop acting as though land votes, every state has representation, they don't also need extra votes for president. Unless you're suggesting that all other representation that states and counties have are useless?

Genocidal? Okay you're trolling now.

Also, Trump is not my president. Not only Americans are on Reddit and people from other countries are allowed to have opinions."
videos,fgl2ale,t1_fgkt57e,1580879807.0,And that wouldn't be okay either! The police (and anyone that immediately dismisses these stories) should absolutely be held to account. Police should be doing their jobs instead of ignoring something because it's not likely it would turn into something or just because they don't wanna.

videos,fgkqg50,t1_fgkmzx7,1580871333.0,"No, that's not how it works at all. You don't assume an accusation is a fact, you investigate the accusation as though it was something that actually happened. You don't just prosecute people all willy nilly.

If someone robbed your house and the police came and chatted to you a bit then shoved it the file in a room never to be seen again would you say that you were taken seriously? Would you say that the police believed you? Because in many places this is what happens with rape kits, it's not an opinion, it's proven that this happens.

I say the phrasing is poor because it gives people wiggle room to misinterpret the actual message. It's a slogan, just like ""lock her up"" was. Did you think that Trump meant to grab her and lock her up without investigation and trial? Because going by those three words that's what he's implying if these two slogans are to be taken in the same manner, at face value."

videos,fgkdkyf,t1_fgiwwwb,1580863084.0,"I think that people mean that this is a word that's always been used and so they use it without thinking of where it came from at all. The intent is to call someone weak, timid and cowardly. If they're using it as a reference to a woman then they're not only wrong but also a piece of shit."

videos,fgkd6lv,t1_fgjt8zd,1580862820.0,Pray tell how is explaining the intent of a horribly phrased slogan gaslighting? Swear to god people just throw around any term they want nowadays regardless of whether or not it's actually true. I also think we should believe all men in this regard. Any reports of sexual assault should be believed to the point of investigation.
videos,fgkd08c,t1_fgjqudt,1580862706.0,"I disagree that that's what is meant but I do agree that the phrasing is god awful because that's definitely what it implies.

And you said it yourself, when you take a claim seriously you do all of those things. The problem is a lot of the time those things aren't done."

You say lighten up, I say show people some respect during a time that generally regarded as private time.

Edit: Just a quick question. Do you also talk to people when they're praying or having conversations with friends or having a meal by themselves? If you would respect their privacy in these moments why would you insist on disrespecting the other?"
videos,fgitx92,t1_fgiqr3x,1580830830.0,"I didn't say it was short for it, I said it was derived from it. What makes more sense, that a word for someone we consider weak is derived from a word that means cowardly or timid or that it comes from pussy cat?"

videos,fgipohp,t1_fgikeqr,1580828060.0,There's a big difference in believing all women and prosecuting all accused. Believe all women by taking their claims seriously and investigating them properly instead of filing rape kits in a dusty corner never to be tested.
