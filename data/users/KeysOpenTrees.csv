relationships,ffvs5hj,t1_ffvs0yc,1580271716.0,I thought about it... i mean trust is so important but I love her so much. We are so incredibly close and she is so good to me. Shes my rock. But... this really upset me. Shes perfect in literally every way. She’s never lied or been dishonest before
relationships,ffvs2b7,t1_ffvs01r,1580271645.0,I have tried to explain it over and over but she insists it’s unimportant and just a small thing

sex,feinls3,t1_feiit3l,1579142736.0,"Thats horrible, Im so happy you have to go through this. What kind of government intervention Separates couples?

I would just call it quits, honestly. Let her go. She will find more partners, it’s very obvious by now. You deserve better. Don’t torture yourself holding out for her when she won’t do the same for you. Youre calling her your girlfriend while she actively sleeps with other men. Its going to be hard, but you need to let her go"

Why would she actively deceive you and lie to you multiple times? That’s not love. People who love eachother don’t do that to eachother. You need to break it off. She will cheat again, if she isn’t already"

sex,feeirp9,t3_eooxgo,1579034588.0,"??? What a weird thought. Do you often avoid compliments to avoid giving her confidence? I feel bad for her. As others said, I guess it does make sense that you have to date somebody a decade younger than you"

He wants to orgasm everytime but doesnt care when you do? Id be very upset and annoyed. Does that level of selfishness translate to any other aspects of your guys lives?"
sex,fecju8y,t1_fec0vbh,1578975661.0,"Yeah. As a guy honestly I am able to eat my girlfriend out for quite a while, as long as she needs whenever I get done fucking her and have an orgasm myself. Definitely selfish of him"

relationship_advice,fcvrz8f,t1_fcvqdtc,1578008765.0,You said absolutely nothing about him in your first comment. Thats why i commented. How many times can i condemn her actions before you see it? Are you blind?

relationship_advice,fcvphww,t1_fcvoy6j,1578007169.0,"Whos door did she try to tear down where did it say that? She was getting drunk with him and he left her. You cant leave somebody by themselves alone like that. He didnt help her get in and she threw up. What was she supposed to do? Should she have cleaned it up? Yes she should have. Im not excusing her actions, Im just saying you were ignoring his. Youve never been shitfaced and in need of friends?

It was completely wrong of her to trash the apartment, of course it was, im condemning that. But he fucked up big time too. They both did"
relationship_advice,fcvompk,t1_fcvo1sk,1578006622.0,"What? Are you joking? 

You think that because she was drunk and went to the wrong apartment that she chose to “break into somebodys apartment?” I seriously cant tell if youre trolling or not. You think she chose to throw up in the hallway? She couldnt get into the apartment and he wouldnt help her. She had no choice. 

She drove TWO HOURS to see him and he ditched her for his friends. She got drunk so??? Are you shaming her for that? He is a dick for ditching her, but then completely ignored her when she needed help finding the apartment. That’s so shitty. Then he said all that horrible shit? 

She’s at fault for throwing shit, yes, but it’s hilarious how much malice you are applying to her while giving him a million passes when hes a way bigger dick for sure"
relationship_advice,fcvo4ef,t3_ej5wtj,1578006303.0,Give the car back and get help. Protect yourself and get him out of your life. The car isnt worth it. I don’t understand why youre keeping the car still
relationship_advice,fcvnrik,t1_fcvnfwv,1578006076.0,"Whoa whoa whoa, I understand she shouldn’t have thrown the shit but are we gonna ignore the fact that he abandoned her while she was drunk and alone and then proceeded to say all that shit to her face to hurt her? She shouldn’t have thrown the stuff, that’s true, but to call her and only her out doesnt seem right"
relationship_advice,fcvnib7,t3_ej5smu,1578005916.0,"You need to leave that relationship, it’s toxic. You were shitfaced by yourself in a place you weren’t familiar with and not only did he not help but he IGNORED you. So many bad things could have happened. He didn’t care, he cared more about hanging out with his friends. That is not okay. 

Not only that but when he got home he started screaming at you, told you he hated you and all these other horrible things to make you feel bad? That is unacceptable. This is not a healthy relationship. The history doesn’t matter, he clearly doesn’t respect you. Im so sorry you had to go through this, it sounds awful. I understand you throwing stuff, while it might not be the right thing to do that does not give him an excuse to act the way he did. Especially because it was in response to him abandoning you for his friends while you were drunk and alone."
