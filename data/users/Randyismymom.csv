As we were walking, a fella pulled up with a vodka bottle, cracked it, and started coming at me with it. Now I have recently watched the movie the Irishman, and it saved my life. Jimmy Hoffa said “charge a gun, run from a knife.” So I yelled “run guys run” and we all fuckin booked it. He chased us for about a block then we lost him. He might’ve gotten away with it too if he disposed of the bottle properly, there were seemingly no cameras around and it was very dark anyway"
