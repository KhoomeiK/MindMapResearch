Look into how they collaborate, look into the curriculum they use, know what they are doing in the school and use smart language. Ask questions about things you are actually wondering based on how the school is run. Look up practice interviews and go over it a few times. 

As for the lesson plan do something you are very comfortable doing. Set your procedures immediately and make it fun and engaging. Whole class response using hand signals is always Impressive. Good luck!
