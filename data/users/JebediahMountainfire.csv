GTA6,ffhdsea,t1_ffhczoz,1579931174.0,"Its not just the fact that its a non-exclusive title. It's the fact that its Grand Theft Auto. GTA 5 is the 3rd best selling videogame of all time and GTA 6 is likely to perform as well or better. The hype would be shifted towards GTA 6 and nobody would be talking about the PS5. The point of a launch event is to generate hype and interest in the product being launched. Like photoshop being on an ipad, thats a great selling point for the ipad. 

The issue here is not only that its a non-exclusive title, but its literally the biggest title they could possibly announce. The only games with greater sales figures than GTA 5 are Minecraft and Tetris. Neither of these are likely to have any sequels. GTA is the most popular gaming title out there that is going to have a sequel and announcing that title along with your console just does not make sense.
