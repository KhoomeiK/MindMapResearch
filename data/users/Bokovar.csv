Explain it’s your special day, and you want to celebrate with the women in your life. Also explain that it’s traditionally a female event, so having any man would be awkward. 

Have the shower elsewhere. Your mom’s husband is making this event about him. Don’t let him highjack your shower and steal your bliss. And don’t let your mom guilt him into it."

Because I've always had giant molossers, I am hyper vigilant about public behavior. In part because some idiots have brought their large dogs up to my sitting/laying dog to see if anything would happen. Parents will let their children run up to and put their faces in the dog's face. (Really?! WTH?!) But I had a postal carrier freak out when one was sitting next to me, doing absolutely nothing. She threw her leather bag full of letters at my dog, I jumped when the bag also hit, and the dog jumped up and nipped her. Val didn't bite her hard, nipped her with her front teeth, but it was enough.

We didn't even get in trouble because my dog wasn't doing anything. But it was a really sad case.

Also, I do animal work. I shut down really sick animal stuff on twitter, I work on dog flippers, and do a bit of work associated with rescuing animals. I love dogs. Like everyone else here :)

My problem in this situation is really with the individual that was walking the dog. And that problem woman: the first time she raised her voice or acted aggressively, I would have told her the the next time she came at me or my dog would be the last. Also, I would have called the police to find out what could be done because she was acting aggressively toward the dog. Where we live that would take one phone call to fix.

But, because of public perception and prejudices and their own safety, large dogs need someone who cannot be dragged or otherwise lose control of them. I have rheumatoid arthritis, had two partial and two full knee replacements since 2014. My dogs are spoiled rotten and some people at the place I board them can't handle them and don't. But they would never drag me. When my stepdaughter was 10, she could walk our last corso. She was a great dog handler.

It's not the dogs. They want to please us. But we need to protect them. And we do so by ensuring they're safe in public. And the handler is key."
dogs,feew4y1,t3_eomrod,1579042496.0,"So many people don't understand any dog, but especially a puppy or a new dog, is a lot of work. And I'll never understand those that believe an animal is disposable.

I'll never forget neighbors I had in the mid-80s. They wouldn't spay their female dog and she kept having litters. One day I stopped by the local animal shelter. I often did to donate supplies or talk to the Animal Warden; he was a former coworker of a family friend, both retired DC Bomb Squad dog handlers. 

The neighbors had taken their female, Dixie, to the shelter and kept one of her pups. I'm actually crying as I type this because Dixie recognized me. We already had two or three dogs and a cat and there was no way we could take her home. But for the next two years, I never spoke to them again. And it's still so upsetting that this poor dog knew me and I had to walk away from her."

Your logic is nonsensical, and your assumptions grotesque and completely noncontextual to my statements. 

I work to save animals, dogs, in particular. Furthermore, if your assumptions are indicative of your analytical abilities, no wonder you don't understand -- and are wrong about -- Koehler."
dogs,feermgf,t3_eolzu3,1579039730.0,"Difference of opinion that isn’t going to change on either side and, ultimately, mine is irrelevant.

You’ve gotten excellent advice re training and protection, especially in the last few comments, so I’m sure you’ll be fine.

I’m a boomer. Last year; I’m 56. Kids grown/in college. I like quiet. But I love the sound of kids playing. 

Only thing I don’t like and will complain about is people letting their dogs bark hours at a time (annoying and neglectful), or parking across my driveway (obvious)."
dogs,feefx7m,t1_fee3syq,1579032941.0,"Thank you. Understandable. Appreciate your patience. 

(But you really need a new handler for your dog.)"
dogs,fee3jic,t3_eolzu3,1579025656.0,"Disagree. Dogs in public spaces should be impervious to non physical provocation. Owner admitted it’s not. 

There’s always some idiot that allows his/her child or dog to harass a peaceful giant dog. I tell people nicely to back off. If they don’t, I warn them I’m going to drop the leash. 

That said, if the walker can’t control the dog, she has no business walking it. End. 

We’ve always had giant dogs, trained them ourselves (Koehler method) and, unless they are given their command, they will not leap, jump, or bark at people while on the street.

Trespassers on our property are different. That’s their yard."
dogs,fedn7w2,t3_eolzu3,1579015621.0,"Your dog walker is a problem; she cannot control the dog. And your dog is a problem; its behavior is inappropriately aggressive. 

My two dogs - Corsos -are extremely protective. I have rheumatoid arthritis and I can walk them without incident. Their combined weight is about 250 lbs. 

However you are the crux of the problem. You’re an irresponsible pet owner."
