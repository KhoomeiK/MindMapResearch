This can manifest in your expectation of the events in your daily life to occur and repeat in a predictable way. In other words an aspie plans everything ahead, so they would be inflexible to things that conflict with the events they expect to occur and this restricts what they do. For example they might only eat hamburgers once a week and every Wednesday that's what they buy for lunch but on monday a coworker invites him to a burger joint for lunch. The aspie will either have to decline or change what he eats on Wednesday.

It can also be logically based. An example is one aspie when using the bathroom. Everytime he'll first turn on the facet, pee, wash his hands, open the door than wash his hands again and then turn off the facet. That might seem like strange and repetitive behavior. However running the water first gives it time to warm up so their hands aren't left cold after rinsing and not everyone rinses their hands before touching the door handle so the aspie rinses again after touching it."
