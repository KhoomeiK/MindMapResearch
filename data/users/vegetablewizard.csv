People that play more tend to be better. Therefore they have the most time to experience and UNDERSTAND the fluctuations in matchmaking. If you play once a week and queue into 20 matches, you've barely warmed up by the last match. It's a BR, it isn't supposed to be easy.

So, SBMM isn't really about skill, it's about catering to the casual player who doesn't really care about getting better. Hence the argument that dedicated players are being punished."
