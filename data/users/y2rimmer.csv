starcitizen,fezvt2n,t1_fezf8tg,1579462307.0,"This is indeed cool. The effort here is brilliant. Also, is that a constellation I see parked up!?"
starcitizen,fezuu5o,t3_eqzpu2,1579461950.0,Prepare for the inevitable army of space ambulances now! XD
starcitizen,fezuctm,t1_fezaiwm,1579461766.0,"Exactly my thoughts! Maybe also Edge of Tomorrow, when he's dropping into battle repeatedly.
Live Die Repeat!"

pcgaming,fesgdfl,t1_ferg9hk,1579364899.0,100% Those damn mimics and their jumpscares are a major brown pants moment.
starcitizen,fes620d,t1_fes0gc8,1579361821.0,Say it's not so! Much like my social life the carrack is an elusive beast. I don't own a one but I'm looking forward to seeing other people flying it around the verse. Maybe I can hop on board =)
starcitizen,femc34q,t1_felzn52,1579248015.0,I actually love it. I also have a constellation but I find myself using the aurora more. There's just something so sexy about my flying brick.
pcgaming,fekr5ul,t1_fej9wgw,1579205901.0,"Yeah I was crazy about this one too. There was actually a demo for it which I played over and over again. I had never played a demo so much, not since a game called Breed. That game turned out to be disappointing though"
