boulder,fd698gf,t1_fd67w79,1578187466.0,"Rebutting my point by linking to an article (CNN, lol) that compares the interventions to Iraq based on cost is comically missing the point (also very on brand for a self-identifying liberal). Drone striking children in the middle east isn't bad because it costs money. CTRL+F ""democracy"" No results found.

> Supporting Saudi Arabia and its interests is completely fucked up. They're extremists that were responsible for 9/11. And they have so much power in Washington that nobody will call them out. That doesn't mean either party actually wants to support them - as much as it is a recognition that some foreign nations have vastly outsized influence on our election process: Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Russia primarily.

What does any of this have to do with the fact that Obama was the person who ok'd the US backing of the intervention there? He gets a pass because ""everyone's doing it""? This is exactly the sort of weak willed liberal justification we see time and time again for giving their leaders a pass instead of holding their feet to the fire. Does pretending like he had no choice make you feel better about voting for a man who's actions have led to the worst Cholera outbreak since the Haitian earthquake? Over a thousand children have died, why carry water for these people?"
boulder,fd5yai0,t1_fd5dazf,1578183028.0,"The idea that the Libyan and Syrian interventions were minor military support for democracy is a comical reading of the situation, but if you want to believe that, feel free I guess.

One question though, is providing logistical support for Saudi Arabia's war against Yemen also minor military support for democracy?

There's a reason it's called the ""bipartisan consensus on foreign policy"", neither party is interested in disrupting the status quo, and as far as I can tell a vast majority of Democratic voters have no interest in holding the leaders of the party accountable or pursuing change. The ones that do rarely identify as liberal."

Personally I'd count our involvement in Yemen as well, not to mention the Iraq and Afghanistan wars which he escalated as opposed to drawing down. If you don't want to count those as ""started wars"" well then, Trump hasn't started any either, so /shrug

Keep in mind Congress hasn't declared war since 1942 before you quibble about those not counting."
boulder,fd3wxg2,t1_fd3s9n6,1578162309.0,Liberals like war though? Obama started quite a few himself. I think you underestimate how much bipartisan support there is for the US military industrial complex.
