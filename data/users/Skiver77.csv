cycling,fflyayi,t1_fflwapb,1580045665.0,"You misunderstand, I need a case to put my phone in that I plan to attach the quad lock to."
cycling,fflva7h,t1_fflueqp,1580044603.0,"Oh I get you, nope. I care more about the case being truly secure. I worry with most cases, enough bumps and it may just pop out.

I think if the weather was truly wet and Id just stick my phone somewhere more waterproof."
cycling,fflu7xv,t1_fflselk,1580044264.0,"For the OnePlus?

Last time I looked I didn't see anything for this phone, it was just iPhones, Samsung and one or two others."
AbruptChaos,ffeipji,t1_ffdd3ao,1579849621.0,"It is indeed, it's called The Purple Turtle in Reading, UK."
PUBG,fezst3g,t1_fez0gc5,1579461197.0,"Unless I'm misunderstanding, are you suggesting radar is more likely on console? I would have thought it was the same regardless not platform?"
SpaceXLounge,fezrs6a,t1_fezptdc,1579460817.0,"From what I know it wasn't self destructed. The forces put on the falcon 9 once it lost a nose cone (dragon) it was expected to be ripped apart.

I'm not sure of they knew it would blow so spectacularly and so quickly but they knew it wasn't coming down in one piece one way or another."
oddlysatisfying,fezoufs,t3_eqwda7,1579459804.0,"I don't know why, but my brains initial thought was to ask why you were painting on a block of cheese. Thankfully it finally kicked in to see it was actually canvas.

It always amazes me when people do stuff like this"

PUBGConsole,fen9dbv,t3_epxauu,1579279813.0,Is it wrong that I'm a little disappointed you didn't die from a fall when you dropped down?
AskReddit,fen8w2r,t1_fen8qwf,1579279524.0,"Yep, I hit post then my brain kicked into gear."
AskReddit,fen8os2,t3_epxprc,1579279400.0,"Give Luna her shoes back.

Edit: the minute I hit post I remembered she was a ravenclaw. I'll let myself out."
PUBGConsole,femc3sg,t3_epx2zm,1579248039.0,"It's probably a gun I don't use so I don't really care too much about this in particular, that said I kinda wish all guns were available on all maps regardless.

I usually run an m4 where possible, one reason for that is it doesn't matter what map I'm on I can find it. I'm less likely to run a QBZ for example because I'm just not as used to it's behaviour."
dogpictures,fej8iuy,t1_fehjii4,1579161482.0,"I believe it's all to do with the mum, if the mum is a Springer then it's springador. If the mum was a lab then it's a labradinger"

lordsmobile,fdg7q0h,t3_eks1pe,1578383511.0,"Played for 2 years or so with 180m might and never spent anything in the game.

I should be higher might but lost a lot of troops due to silly mistakes in the last year.

I know I won't ever be at the top and fighting with the big people but I'm happy slowly growing and making progress on my own."
oneplus,fcwvipe,t3_ejag4w,1578039364.0,"Never used a Samsung and always used Nexus, Pixel phones in the past with stock Android.

One reason I never considered other phones was because I didn't want another company to mess around with what I was happy with but the Oxygen OS feels so minimal to me that I barely notice it at times.

My only gripe is the auto brightness seems really on the slow and dark side most of the time. I don't think I found myself manually brightening the screen half as much as I do now."
netflix,fcwvcq3,t1_fcu28t6,1578039160.0,"100% right.

I bought the game a year or two back when it was on sale because I'd heard how good it was but just never found a desire to start.

After watching the TV show, I've now added all the books to my wishlist in audible and even fired up the game even though I knew I didn't have a lot of time to play."
audible,fcmts07,t3_ehxbwg,1577791885.0,"I wonder if this is why I've recently been noticing the app open and chapters further in then I remembered.

Thanks for at least bringing it to my attention, thought I was going mad."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fcl6e1z,t1_fcl66iv,1577740789.0,"Actually come to think of it, he has actually had ""Human food"".

He had frozen carrots when he was teething. As well as pasta, sweet potato and boiled chicken when he's had a bit of an upset stomach."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fcl3e26,t1_fckfq4g,1577738936.0,"Came here to say this, If I take a step towards the kitchen he's awake and following. He's never even had Human food, but he follows like he believes today is the day he's been waiting for."
netflix,fcdba3g,t3_egvpcg,1577608416.0,"Agreed with you, it wasn't until part way through the season, I think the law of surprise episode, that I realised it wasn't linear.

I did enjoy it and have thought about going back to see if I missed something that made it obvious with hindsight. Glad it's not just me."
PUBGConsole,fbw1i3h,t1_fbufe1j,1577139181.0,"I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong and I don't recall the true detail, but I'm sure someone once said that the reason the patches are so big is because it's basically the entire game again. Something to do with the engine (or at least blueholes use of it) that means rather than being able to replace specific files/code you have to repackage the game whole."
