Also that is only one small aspect of what comprises intelligence. His discipline is a form of intelligence.

So that’s the question right? Do you deserve the consequences of your actions regardless of intent? 

The law obviously says no; manslaughter charges show that..there’s tons of other examples..for what that’s worth if anything.

It was an accident and that matters. Your position is that the fact that it was an accident doesn’t matter and I just can’t agree with that. I can’t justify this level of stupidity unfortunately..I mean yea he is recklessly stupid and it lead to the death of an innocent child. I get that and I also understand that he should be held accountable and possibly even put in jail. I get all that. 

But he shouldn’t be treated like someone who willfully killed this girl. There ARE plenty of people who actually do that: kill children willfully. But you and a lot of other people just have your pitchforks out and I’m just saying I’m not coming along."

assholedesign,feq011l,t1_fepxjxo,1579335351.0,Sorry I’m just bitter. You’re right it works great if your margins are right. Like a service for example. In my experience for retail it’s nearly impossible to make google ads work for anything you’re selling under $10. The margins are just too tight and paying $1-$2  on a 3% conversion does not and will never make any sense but google doesn’t give a shit they’ll let you do it anyway until you they bleed you fucking dry. Their support and training and answer books are a total cluster fuck so the only way to understand it all is by testing and trying and testing and trying and finally after thousands of dollars you learn what I’ve just told you and instead focus your time on finding products that cost more and have wider margins. If someone had said to me what I just said to you three years ago it would have saved me thousands literally if I was miraculously smart enough to pay attention to it..
