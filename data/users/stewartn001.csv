OverwatchUniversity,fffmfoc,t1_ffflj9y,1579887110.0,Ya that wouldn’t be bad. I could maybe get on board with something a long the lines of that. I just have this personal bias that I think the guy with the bow and arrow shouldn’t be as effective as he is at close range. But tbh as a support main he’s not the worst dps to deal with...I’m looking at you all that main doomfist lol
OverwatchUniversity,fffl4o7,t1_fferrvf,1579886313.0,I wish we could have more than 3 avoids and that it lasted more than 7 days lol
OverwatchUniversity,fffjdse,t1_fffijgu,1579885228.0,I concur doctor but with scatter I just made sure I wasn’t going into a small room when I knew there was a Hanzo just waiting to pounce. Where as now I worry about that hanzo melting my hog at close range which just seems like it’s something he shouldn’t be able to do
OverwatchUniversity,fffgo7n,t1_ffffqfz,1579883559.0,Personally I think storm arrows was more deadly than scatter arrow ever was. Plus when people watch that awesome dragon cinematic people won't get confused when he uses said scatter arrow.

OverwatchUniversity,fffe2ix,t3_et233r,1579881928.0,"hey dps people....just curious but was mcCree really dying that quickly? I feel like a lot McCree's I play with never really complained or had an issue. Not sure if this is just in my games and Im sheltered or what. I am excited for that buff in his ultimate though. Its very cheesy in low ElOs but I never see any value in it in my games.

medicine,fcy9ha8,t1_fcxya5d,1578076646.0,So dumb question number 537: is a blood filled sponge something easy to miss inside someone? Or is this just more of hey we used x amount of sponges. When we sew this lady back up we need the same x amount?
medicine,fcxyics,t1_fcxya5d,1578072250.0,Thanks for the insight!
medicine,fcxpo9x,t3_ejbz26,1578068528.0,"ok so first I want to  say that I am not a doctor...and I acknowledge that this sucks that this slipped through the cracks while going down the line of all these professionals and that its something that should not happen and no one can argue how awful that is. 

But for all the docs, nurses and other lifesavers here...(probable unpopular opinion/question) at what point is the patient held liable for her own actions? She is a diabetic because she does not take of herself. She's made poor health-style choices. She now needs bypass surgery because she has still not changed her habits and poor lifestyle choices. I just can't stop thinking that she put herself there in the first place. So we throw her on a surgery schedule and a mistake occurs during surgery that causes her to lose a leg later on due to other misses. But if she didn't have the bypass she probably would of been dead right? Is medicine just held to that high of a standard that no mistakes can occur? Is this large sum of money because there were so many misses? Is there a more complicated issue with medicine that I can't comprehend due to my tiny brain? Is there something in the article that I am missing due to aforementioned limited brain size?

Also how do we put blame the surgeon at fault (at least 10% of it)? Surgery is risky. Anything bad can happen which is why they don't try to cut people up at every chance they get. Its not his fault she was there to begin with and its not like he had evil intentions thinking ""ha watch me leave a sponge in here."" Or at least im assuming the intention wasn't there. Is this the wrong thought process?
