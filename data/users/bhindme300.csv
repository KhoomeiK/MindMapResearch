Showerthoughts,ffjr3om,t3_etxjtu,1580004752.0,I take offense that women show all their wares  in a movie but unless it’s a porn they don’t have dudes showing theirs  . Us ladies would like to see males nude in action flicks too.
Bible,ffjpye7,t3_etx37a,1580003996.0,"I think praying is not begging but a way to us to come to God and speak with him one to one just us . 
He wants a personal relationship with each of us and praying is a way for that to happen ."

CPTSD,ffjleu8,t3_ets2vh,1580000929.0,"This is me to a T and I never told my therapist that I did this, I thought he would think I was well you know NUTS, the only time it stops is when  I’m sleeping and even then it’s fitful sleep.  Or it stops like you said when I’m engaged in conversation  with someone else. And yes nasty arguments and arguing with my abusers from when I was little as I couldn’t speak up back then, replaying conversations constantly and even then I’m sabotaging myself it’s like not even in my own head am I a victor. Ugh . 
Thank you thank you thank you for posting this. You are a life savers because I never knew anyone else did this. OMG finally an answer to what this is called. I’d have people say whaat are you doing because as I’m conversating -ruminating my facial expressions go along with what I’m thinking so of course it would look odd to someone next to me. 
I can now look up all the things you’ve spoke about on here and get some help . I cannot express what your post has just done for me. And I sincerely hope you get the help you’re looking for."

CPTSD,ffg5vuv,t3_etczj1,1579899124.0,"I’ve gotten to the point where the minute a news broadcast starts in and I feel that tinge of anxiety , I immediately change the channel. News in the radio starts in I shut it off. There are a lot of things I won’t watch anymore just because my anxiety kicks is . This new coronvirus or however it’s spelled. ANXIETY!!!!!!
