unpopularopinion,fdgqgwn,t1_fdgm2ab,1578405637.0,"Oh yeah I realise that about face value and heritage, but when there are 400 boys from a school doing it you assume some mustn't have Maori heritage. That's awesome, when it dawned on me that maybe it's just NZ culture not one part or the other I felt pleased. Its as it should be :)"
unpopularopinion,fdgj1im,t1_fdfwiqx,1578398822.0,"My grandfather came to Australia when he was about 25, he was born in Holland, worked since he was 16 in Germany and was locked up in a Russian camp. The language we were all spoken to was a mixture of all three languages, we understood, when my Auntys and Uncles came over from Holland I remember them telling him to speak English as he made no sense!!! He thought he was speaking Dutch but he was speaking a very messy mixture!! Anyway, he was an Aussie thru and thru and very very proud. First thing he did was sign up for the Australian Army and served for his country."
unpopularopinion,fdgil77,t1_fdgblm7,1578398309.0,"Ahh really, you may be able to answer my question on a similiar theme. I have noticed some non Moari people (on FB and the news etc) performing the haka. Initially I was like ""Oh that's not ok"" then I thought about it and I have guessed may be the haka is a Maori thing that all of NZ has embraced? And so if you are a Kiwi you are welcome to do it? Is that the case? I've always wondered. I am not sure if white people in Australia are able to participate in a lot of aboriginal things as they have a lot of initiations first I think?  

For an Aussie who has only ever seen them on tv I am not sure if I could handle the emotion of seeing one in person. The power and emotion that goes into them no matter  if it's hundreds of people of a hand full of people is just overwhelming. Brings me to tears every time."
