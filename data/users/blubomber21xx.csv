socialanxiety,fekwlz2,t3_epplw4,1579209113.0,"I'm about to be 28 and I've never been in one. Never held hands with or kissed someone. I too try to imagine what it would be like to be in one and the entire thing just feels alien. And I can feel you on the being cheated part, I liked a girl one time and the first dream I had about her - I dreamt she cheated on me. Mind you we were not even talking that was just a dream I had about her. I don't know how to not feel so alone."
socialanxiety,feeanc5,t3_eokb3w,1579029843.0,I'm 28.
socialanxiety,fe6hv5n,t3_enw18s,1578891382.0,"I'm fixing to be 28 and I relate to this so hard. I graduated college 4 1/2 years ago and still cannot find a job in my profession, because I do not have any formal experience nor any kind of network to leverage. Meanwhile, I heard from a so-so friend that this one guy that went to school with us has his career going - not to be rude but this guy had a brick for a brain; whether he had social anxiety or not I don't know but from the looks of it he was what I would call normal."
socialanxiety,fe5nf3q,t3_enna0n,1578871761.0,I remember watching the show 'dating around ' on Netflix and pretty sure I was tense watching the show.
AskReddit,fdlkfyl,t3_elssvy,1578526033.0,"Because old shows were in black and white , I used to think real life was also in black and white."
socialanxiety,fdl1vgw,t3_elwwxb,1578515610.0,"I know what you mean. I feel like I'm losing the only friend I have because I don't reach out. I didn't wish her good cheer these past holidays.  IDK though I feel like if I lose her I wouldn't really care. It's difficult because sometimes it feels like things have run there course and the ending of the friendship seems natural just because it happens in life that people drift apart. What's difficult for me is knowing whether it is indeed that reason or , again, my inability to maintain relationships."
socialanxiety,fdi0bxf,t3_el5db7,1578433454.0,"I'm about to be 28 and feel so undeveloped emotionally and mentally, however I'm trying my best to not judge myself so hard anymore. It's difficult because it feels like all I've ever done is be very critical towards myself. I've been reading articles on building emotional intelligence and I kinda feel like it might help towards maturing as a person. Acknowledging that I am also really sensitive and watching how certain interactions effect me then talking my way through it and being compassionate towards myself also kinda helps, I just started doing this kinda stuff so who knows how far it will go."
socialanxiety,fdho76g,t3_elff0v,1578426804.0,I tried it and it did mellow me out a little but it also gave me a depressive mood. I don't remember what dosage it was though.
socialanxiety,fdfh2vx,t3_el3xg6,1578361533.0,"I ask myself this a lot of the time. I do know that I am incredibly insecure - to the point that no one has seen me shirtless in 15 years. I have some skin issues that make me feel unattractive. What I don't understand is how deep these insecurities are that I cannot develop relationships - or who knows if there is even a connection. It makes sense that if you cannot maintain a good relationship with yourself, how can you expect to do so with other people?  It also makes me wonder if I am that superficial. I would like to believe that I attribute people's value for who they are as opposed to what they look like, I don't imagine that I would terminate a friendship with someone if I found out they had some flaw to the extreme that I perceive mine to be. I have tried to focus on the thought of just enjoying someone's person and it has helped me a little bit towards feeling better about myself. Still though, I don't believe I'll be walking around shirtless anytime soon lol. Good luck on your procedure hopefully it helps with being more comfortable with yourself."
socialanxiety,fdf8t3j,t3_el23eq,1578355976.0,Pft. I know it will be hard with S/A but all I can say is try and network your ass off! I graduated 4 1/2 years ago and still can't find a job in my field. I literally don't know anyone like that and here I am paying for it. If there is a club at your school that deals with your field go to it. Go to your schools career help department if they have one.

socialanxiety,fczm4r4,t3_ejnxsq,1578104229.0,"In college I had this one guy make an effort to sit next to me in classes and talk to me. We got along pretty well and I thought maybe we kinda had a friendship. One night I asked him if he wanted to hang out, he said ' lol no man im good' so I said ok and then proceeded to delete his contact information from my phone. We never spoke after that. I don't get people."
socialanxiety,fcwpf13,t3_ej9svi,1578032564.0,I congratulate you on your courage man! I signed up for a dating app but am way to scared to put my face on it lol.
socialanxiety,fcteqbd,t3_eism6r,1577940905.0,I am beginning to think this as well. A lot of it can be the anxiety but as well as some very deep insecurities. So it's either that I'm in anguish over wanting a women but being to anxious and insecure to get one or completely shutting off all emotional and physical desires.
socialanxiety,fct7vvu,t1_fct1ozi,1577935209.0,How can you be so sure? IDK what to believe sometimes.
socialanxiety,fcss4k8,t3_einrcl,1577923721.0,I was just about to post something related to this. Sometimes it feels like I can't trust myself and that all of this anxiety bs is something that I just made up. I wish there was a way for someone to look into my brain and just straight up tell me what my problem is. Or maybe it is anxiety and me telling myself that it's not real is actually me finding an excuse to not do anything about it.
socialanxiety,fcr4x9w,t3_eifig2,1577896826.0,I remember when I was a child my dad took me to McDonald's and he told me to tell the cashier what I wanted. I think it was my first time doing that  so maybe that's why I was so scared but I couldn't even look at the cashier. I remember holding my head down and mumbling at some point. I do not remember if my father had to finish placing the order for me. I compare this to my niece who when she was younger who would actually yell out 'hi' to random strangers whenever we went somewhere.
socialanxiety,fco9k9c,t3_ei8jo1,1577826853.0,We're basically in the same boat lol. With the exception of psychedelics and cbt I relate to everything. At this point I'm starting to think it might be autism or something. I wish I could give you some advise but I can't. All I can say is I relate and hope for the best for you.
socialanxiety,fco9089,t3_ehx8ub,1577826477.0,"I feel comfortable with older people I guess because I feel they aren't as judgmental. With younger people, I guess it depends. Sometimes I'm intimidated by the fact that they probably have more life experience than me."
socialanxiety,fco8ljs,t3_ei16i8,1577826194.0,"Pretty much. I so desperately wish I could be talkative and such it just seems like those kinds of people actually connect and have relationships. IDK though if the quietness is just a symptom of introversion. Over on that thread I saw someone make a comment that even they have stuff in common with someone they won't bother talking unless spoken to. Whatever the situation is , it's sad and hard."
socialanxiety,fco7swl,t3_ei2z33,1577825727.0,"I'm a very private person so I don't have any social media. Another part of the reason though is because I think having social media would make me even sadder cuz I literally don't have anything to post lol that and seeing other people's lives be happy and stuff
 I know they say that social media is the 'highlight' of people's lives but what do you do when there are no highlights?"
socialanxiety,fco6g0l,t3_ei62fa,1577824977.0,"Same here. I can't initiate or drive conversation though with anyone, especially women. If someone else drives it then I can chime in enough with a joke or something to not be totally dead but if the other person is done talking then the convo pretty much dies after that."
socialanxiety,fcm7s05,t3_ehxoic,1577766478.0,Damn I'm sorry your own mother would berate you like that. The only person that I've told about my anxiety is my brother - no one else really knows tbh I don't think they even know anything is wrong. The one time I talked about it with t brother - he tried to be understanding but I can tell he didn't 'get' it.
socialanxiety,fcalolg,t3_egnwmp,1577571706.0,I'm 27 soon to be 28 and I've never even been in a relationship. Not even held hands or kissed someone. Also don't have any friends. Its very depressing knowing that when I hit 30 I'll still be whatever it is I currently am.
socialanxiety,fc3ob68,t1_fbz98ms,1577394529.0,"Thanks I know what you mean about the weight as I too kinda suffer from weight issues the thing is I'm not terribly overweight but I still can't help but beat myself up over it. Besides that I have terrible skin issues. As far as the not finding anyone yet I just feel so inadequate as a person but also as a man : I'm insecure , meek, I'm boring and just damn frail over just about anything."
socialanxiety,fc1bphd,t3_efga7q,1577313981.0,I know what you mean. How many times has it been said that as humans we are a social species? That being true it feels then that social anxiety is something that has no business existing and yet I can't help but feel like an alien among people.
