oddlysatisfying,ff9eagg,t3_escb2f,1579711145.0,Is it... meant to do that?
woof_irl,ff9e69z,t3_es5s6w,1579711072.0,God bless you for this video! Really needed this right now - smiled wide without intending to.
tattoos,fd9a0xs,t3_ek5ll3,1578230589.0,This is creative! I have a post-surgery one on my wrist and I was in fact wondering if something like this was possible.
aww,fd1e7mz,t3_ejll3j,1578130326.0,... in reverse?
oddlysatisfying,fd0si55,t3_ejia9v,1578123154.0,What sorcery is this!
cats,fcwi130,t3_ej71q9,1578026159.0,He looks like he would 100% mug you in an alley.
aww,fctmitd,t3_eipq95,1577948975.0,That’s so sweet. I’m sure he appreciated the tenderness of this moment. I know I did.
aww,fctm6uk,t1_fctjktc,1577948564.0,"Truly! I’d heard of these being popular in Japan, and then this one opened in Mumbai. It’s so soothing. I’ve been there thrice already, and each time, one of the kitties crawl into my lap unasked and just nuzzle there. I’ll post more pics later - couldn’t figure out how to add more than one to a post."
aww,fctht95,t1_fctehds,1577943751.0,"Nope! Mumbai, India."
horror,fct96pd,t1_fcrvmu5,1577936241.0,Super - thank you!

horror,fct9235,t1_fcq6o8v,1577936139.0,I’ve heard so much about the first two. Thanks for this!
horror,fct8zmq,t1_fcq2wgw,1577936084.0,Thank you!
oddlysatisfying,fcpzpgu,t3_eif1cr,1577875622.0,Wow! The amount of planning that must have gone into this!
aww,fcnyhjy,t3_ei0znt,1577820894.0,Almost looks like he’s taken this photo himself!
horror,fcnlk53,t1_fcnl6b0,1577813833.0,"Yeah, I guess. But it was so antithetical to the rest of the film that it came across as slightly comical. I wish that sense of dread had been maintained. It was a horrifying end, after all."
horror,fcnb38s,t3_ei2zm8,1577807799.0,"LOVED it. 

One minor quibble was that almost comical demon-worshipping bit in the end. Had they just ended the movie with the boy jumping out of the attic window, it would have been perfect. Gave me chills, nevertheless. The mother, oh man! 

Loved the cinematography too - the way they used tilt-shift to make the house and its surroundings look miniature to match the models the mother makes."
Graffiti,fcn6485,t1_fcn62f9,1577804266.0,"Yeah, sigh."
Graffiti,fcn60er,t1_fcm3wiy,1577804187.0,Ugh. Wish they understood the power of art in bringing people together!
aww,fcmoi96,t3_ehygcw,1577784370.0,Look at the pride in the father’s eyes as he watches the son do an impeccable job!

aww,fcck4pe,t1_fccf21c,1577599315.0,"Hahaha I’d love to! But they are all well-settled there. They bring us so much joy, though - my latest trick is to wave at her from afar, and watch her wag her tail in happy anticipation (that’s what she’s doing at the beginning of this video)."
aww,fccapro,t1_fcc7gsk,1577596259.0,"Hahaha! I work in marketing - this is just one of the many strays on our office campus. We feed them and play with them, but mostly leave them alone to relax (most are pretty old)."
aww,fc7otdd,t3_egem2z,1577514620.0,It’s a Christmas miracle!
aww,fc7fjny,t3_egisn6,1577505908.0,Hehehe such a cute walk!
