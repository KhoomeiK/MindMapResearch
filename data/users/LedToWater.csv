news,ff27y25,t1_ff1v2s8,1579496415.0,"You are also creating your own interpretation. The preamble begins with ""We the People of the United States"" and ends with ""do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America"". It should be clear that the constitution is for the American People.

Yes, the previous commenter is misquoting the document. You are right about that. But to imply that the US constitution is granting rights to people other than ""the People of the United States"" seems silly. For example, the second amendment doesn't give the right to bear arms to the people of China; it gives that right to the people of the US.

With that said, the founders did enumerate rights that they felt were inalienable, but hadn't been secured in previous forms of government. So while they *may* have felt that all people *should* have the right against unreasonable search and seizure, the constitution is for the US.

Edit: fixed a couple typos"
UpliftingNews,ff0dqfm,t1_fezy7ne,1579467955.0,"Since you brought up Seattle, we can mention that racism has a long history in their culture too. One can learn about [segregated Seattle](https://depts.washington.edu/civilr/segregated.htm) and the ways they ingrained racism into their culture using restrictive covenants and such. The segregation didn't even begin to thaw much until after WW2, and the effects of racism are still seen today.

Erin is out in the middle of nowhere Middle TN. The three regions of TN have some differences in climate, geography, and culture. In East TN we get a lot more rain. We have the beautiful Smoky Mountains. And to temper your expectations of our people.. we're pragmatic. The way we are straightforward and matter-of-fact can be off-putting to folks, but we aren't bad people. My advice is for people to not take things personally, because just because we said something that made you mad doesn't mean we won't help you in the next breath. It's kinda weird to some people.


I'm very proud to call East TN home. You should come visit sometime. We have lots of lakes and mountains. The fall colors can be great (usually about the third week of Oct). The summer is hot and humid (that happens to be my least favorite time). Lots of outdoor activities like mtn biking, kayaking, rafting, hiking, fishing, hunting, boating, etc (but not much winter sports)."
mildlyinteresting,fe6akdp,t1_fe60eyu,1578885526.0,"I'm from East Tennessee, so I'm biased, and I never think it's awful. But you're not wrong about our winters; they're brown and grey. We get almost no snow, but it is cold and wet. And someone is gonna ask, ""if it were actually cold and wet, wouldn't you get snow""? It's different. It gets cold, then it warms up enough just before the rain hits so that it doesn't snow, then it gets cold again. Maybe you get ice too. When it does snow, it is usually the wet, heavy snow, which turns to slush and the re-freezes overnight when the temp drops again. But the bad part of winter is only a few months.

Some climate data: rainfall about 50 inches per year, only about 6 inches of snow per year, about 70 days with a low below freezing, about 35 days with a high above 90F, about 30% of days will see some measurable precipitation.

That's the way it is around here, and we like it.

So far this winter we have been *very* mild, but we'll have to see what the rest of winter holds."
