tifu,fdh5d8m,t3_eldcu3,1578415732.0,I saw it was locked the other day and thought I would never get it there. I didn’t even know that they had to walk it to the front. Wtf is that. And the worst part is that people are not going to get the condones they need out of embarrassment. They aren’t going to not have sex. I hope they see this and see that people are actually not going to go here anymore because of this.

And the bags they get are already gross, so it’s not like the laundry guy is going to complain, it’s more of the same to them. I’d probably yell at them though and I think life is to short to get mad. But this level of stupidity..,,it’s one of the few things that will make me confrontational"
