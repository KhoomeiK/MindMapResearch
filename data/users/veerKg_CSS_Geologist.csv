On an aside, I don't know what Republicans are afraid of. Bolton is still a partisan Republican, he's not going to say anything that will bring down the administration even if it is corrupt and incompetent. Bolton is also a big believer in the unitary executive and expanded Presidential powers. Bolton's testimony will most likely be hedged - ""Y*es, trump did withhold aid to Ukraine to get a political favor, but that's his right as President and I don't see the problem with the decision itself but maybe in the way it was carried out*"".
