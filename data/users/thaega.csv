Coming from the principle that the most important, when learning something, is regularity over volume, I'd suggest bringing your daily practice to a minimum of 10-15 minutes, and constraining yourself to do this minimum everyday (more if you have the time and feel like it). Basically, instead of practicing ""every now and then"", do some everyday, even if it's just a bit. There are task tracking apps out there that can help you stay consistent with that. Good luck!"

The ideas exposed in it are probably not original ones for most of them (which the author willingly recognizes), but it's presented very clearly, and gives a very useful framework to work with meaning and meaninglessness. Plus, the bibliography at the end of the book is a gold mine if you want to dive deeper into the topics addressed in the book."

It has personally helped me be more conscious about my compulsive phone checking (but maybe your problem is not exactly the same). You can also check the other apps from this suite (called Digital Wellbeing Experiments), I haven't tried them but they might contain interesting stuff."
