It's not like there is a shortage of trust. Just too much trust in the fact one will get backstabbed given enough time."
AdviceAnimals,ffcji3l,t1_ffcb4rr,1579800789.0,And if that day does come....there wont be any politicians either. Money is why they would be there...it only makes sense. That would be trouble itself though.

NoStupidQuestions,ff2u2t1,t1_ff2alp2,1579524194.0,"Ajit Pai worked for Verizon...lobbying for them if  I am not wrong. So they made him boss of what he was lobbying at. Conflict of interest? What's that?

He also did a half-ass effort of requesting telecom's to put anti-robocall measures. Yes...same verizon. And if he as FCC chair doesnt recognize what that demography is like, he isnt qualified for the job. This is a group that has historically never done the right thing unless forced, and even then they have sued to try to wriggle out of it. Asking them nicely was the equivalent of asking water to not be so damned wet all the time."

The office used to be dignified, I am only comparing the current state of it."
