It goes back to the 90s when the Rockets won two in a row, those championships were diminished because it was the two years Jordan was trying to play baseball. Oilers never went to the super bowl, rockets never made it back. The Astros finally put us in a conversation but we have always been considered small market. Our losses have more fame than our wins."

Houston is a very small market team and we have been that way through multiple sports for years. We were a Cinderella story in 05.

Jomboy does make some great vids, but people think he’s already some kind of insider with hot connections. But the dude blasts tweets and deletes them based on new info. 

This is the new PED scandal. The league isn’t going to have to testify in front of house investigation committees, they’re going to punish small market teams and move it out of the news cycle ASAP. Good teams put asses in the seats and money in the owners pockets. Manfred is protecting those interests, not the interest of the fans."

He patented the tools to do so and got super fucking rich. He also developed a ton of addictions. The dude was a huge advertiser of the Houston Astros for years. Brown was accused of assaulting his then wife and at the time ex wife. Star witness in this trial? Jeff fucking Bagwell. All the dirty details came out on the stand and since this was Houston, it made the nightly news for a week.
