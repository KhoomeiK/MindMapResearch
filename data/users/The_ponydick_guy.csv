After about a week of foraging, I still didn't have all 4 crops to make seeds, so I finally read up and discovered that you have to dig up the winter yams and roots. After that, I actually started planting winter crops, but it was still slow going. I had some fruits and veggies left over from previous seasons to make jams and pickles, but those soon ran out. I didn't fill up my silo nearly enough, so after about 2 weeks, I just let my animals starve for the rest of the season instead of buying hay. I also didn't have money for a heater at the time. So, no eggs or milk after a week or so. I didn't spend a whole lot of time on my farm. I ended up finishing the mines and practicing fishing a lot at the lake by the mines (my fishing was still level 1 at the time). Some things I did at the very end were to prepare a new layout for spring (including making lots of sprinklers - no Iridium yet at the time, though), and also save up 50+ winter seeds for the next year.

I'm now in Year 2, nearing the end of Fall, and I am *fucking ready* for Winter! I've got kegs and preserve jars for days, and more than enough crops saved up in chests to keep those babies running all season. My honey supply will likely run out within the first week, but I can live with that. Since I saved up winter seeds last year, I'll be ready to start planting starting day 1. My greenhouse is currently empty, but I have seeds from all seasons saved up so I can start planting in there to my heart's desire, especially Starfruit for the first time. I've also got fish ponds to keep me going, and I have just one more item I need to finish the Community Center (sturgeon fish, which is apparently catchable in winter).

The latest one is about an Everest expedition for some reason, and I think it ends with someone being shoved into an oven.
