AskRedditAfterDark,fegfxcf,t3_eozo9l,1579091428.0,"I think in a lot of relationships the dynamic changes with children and it's hard for one parent to get out of the ""parent' role and into the ""partner"" role. So whatever you can do to help facilitate that transition is going to help the situation. 

A large one that seems common in hetero-normative relationships seems to be the ""supplemental logistical and cultural and emotional"" tasks category. A lot of men allow their spouses to assume the role as ""primary doer and decider"" and then they say ""I don't know what the problem is, I always help out around the house!"" By ""help out"" they mean _do whatever their spouse tells them to do when they tell them to do it_. The strain on attention is still on his spouse to decide that that has to get done. 

Same story with daily activities, shopping, hell...sending birthday cards and thank you cards! This leads to a situation where the man's partner is in charge of ensuring that ANOTHER human (besides their children) is accomplishing the stuff she had to decide to do. So he finds himself in her same mental category as their kids (probably unconsciously) and she, of course, doesn't wanna fuck him.
