Which is totally dumb! But manager checked return tickets every morning for the previous day so it’s not like we could wait until he was gone. Also sucked that if we did take something back that we had to destroy them, so many times I wanted to take home something returned because it would end up trashed anyway.

Our store didnt have *outright* shady practices, but we were expected to upcharge every single customer. 

> Buying an auxiliary cord? Dont you need a Bluetooth speaker? AM/FM transmitter? Oh, and what kind of phone are you using that cord for? Let me check the computer to see if you can upgrade your phone today.

This conversation was expected to happen with every customer that walked in (focus on selling phones) as well as making sure to sell warranties. I was always the best at our store for selling warranties, but as a store we would team up and help each coworker “get that sale”

Often at the expense of rubbing the customer the wrong way. Oh, and we refused to allow customers to return stuff. Unless the packaging looked better than when it actually left the store, we wouldn’t let anyone return stuff which sucked. There were countless times that customers would walk out pissed off and upset at us “I’m never shopping here again” or “you guys are going to go out of business” etc. Happened way too often than what was acceptable.

We had a joke where we would get a new district manager as often as we would change our vacuum bags (which was often—sometimes once a month)

Company stocks were worthless and still continued to go down daily.

In our store, we would smoke weed in the bathroom, even with assistant managers/store managers. Railed tons of coke together, our manager a couple times would tell me and my friend/closing coworker “okay I bought you guys a bottle of wine—just make sure to compete your closing duties” 

If you walked into our RadioShack at any given time, we were either high, and/or drunk, and didn’t give a fuck about you. So sad, but that’s the environment that was fostered.

I started working at a bank (where I learned the importance of customer service) and went back to university full time before hearing that they were going down"
