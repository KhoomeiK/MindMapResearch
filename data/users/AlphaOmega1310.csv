SuicideWatch,fef3fhd,t3_eotk1h,1579047261.0,"I can't say life will get better or that you've got so much to live for because that is why you feel the need to kill yourself. But the thing is that after reading this I can see your a person who just wants love,this guy you feel like is your other half. See your just as Amazing without him and trust me when I say this you'll find someone you love again and maybe this guy will be the one himself. Don't deny the world your greatness. Flourish and show the world how truly great you can be. Be the star that we can follow because you shine bright man,don't just kill that brightness."

Yes you wish to not be judged but from what we are taught (I'm a med student in the UK so it's kind've applicable here) we can't judge anyone who walks through the door,all we can do is learn to understand why and what led them to that choice and hopefully, hopefully try to help. I don't mean to offend anyone here but I just wanted to say you shouldn't hate the ppl that try to care and understand...it's not right."
