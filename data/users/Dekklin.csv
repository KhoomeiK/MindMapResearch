Could you just remove the bleed and make it a heavier Constitution hit, or even make it a raw damage hit? Again, negative synergy (Pyro/intelligence/torturer).

I beg to differ. Just last night a enemy teleported my rogue from right next to it on a tower (where it was casting fireballs) to down in the flames right ontop of my tank. Enemies still use teleportation.

Can you at least negate some of the damage Flesh Sacrifice does to people? It should at least not have negative synergy with many of our stats.

I'll test it again when my multiplayer group hits that area.

>teleports

Yeah theres a lot, theres also a lot of ladders and platforms in almost every encounter. Teleports are how we deal with them. Give it a try at 10m and lets see how it shakes out.

>flesh sac

1 ap for 1 turn that ends up dealing half my friends HP in damage is not balanced. He is a pyro/geo and gains no benefit from blood pools. Even if he went necro, he doesnt get the pool until next turn but then wont really benefit from the AP this turn. Additionally since it now applies bleed, his Torturer talent increases the duration, hurting himself even more. He ALSO spec'd into Pyromancy which increases the damage of the DoT even more. Skills, talents, and racials should not have negative synergy on oneself. Presently, the only use I see for Flesh Sacrifice is Fane with the mask and Ambidextrous to get free item swaps.

He runs away, runs through fire, teleports back, and runs away again. All while my turns are paused because im locked in combat. Him teleporting back to me used to refresh that armor.

Unnerf blood sacrifice, even just a little bit.

And then theres the quest with the woman with a mind maggot in her brain. You can't help her without the now non-existant hard CC

Combat teleports are now not worth the skill slots, especially if you took more than 1, with the free use of The Pawn and more movement granters. Please consider extending the range to 10m. Its still shorter but not painfully so. Presently, I only take one to get up or down a ledge once per combat. I used to have a couple of them slotted for mobility, and mobility is king.

Early game is really not that hard, you just have to pick your fights. Look at the levels of the enemies and if they're above you, come back later. They're not going anywhere. Even 1 level's difference is huge in the early game.

Pick your battles, it's not as hard as people make it seem.

It takes away armor as a health bar. Armors give resistances instead. That way you can have a mixed party of magic and physical without working on entirely separate health/armor bars uselessly. It does much more than that though.

The thing about that mod though, you have to start a new game to run it. But I wouldn't recommend playing the mod without at least experiencing getting off the island in Vanilla so you know what the base game is actually like. Make a hard save once you hit the mainland and start a new game with Divine War and decide whether you want to continue or start over with Divine War.
