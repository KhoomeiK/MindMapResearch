One method is to ""throw away the key"": Close off tempting alternatives. Many people see a productivity boost when they decide not to allow a TV in their home; I haven't owned one in years. But now, TV and more is available on the internet. To block that, you might need a tool like RescueTime. Or, unplug your router when you've got work to do.

*Ok, I do things similar to this already but...*


**Another method is to make failure really painful. The website stickK lets you set aside money you will lose if you don't meet your goal, and ensures that you have an outside referee to decide whether your met your goal or not. To ""up the ante,"" set things up so that your money will go to an organization you hate if you fail. And have your chosen referee agree to post the details of your donation to Facebook if you don't meet your goal.**"

Investing to me sounds like the only reason people get rich, but first you have to pass a threshold.
And the ELI5 as I understand is you take some of your money, give it to a company in order to support them and buy a small percentage of the total of whatever a company makes, and if they're making more than the day before, your rating of that percentage goes up in value, and if it gets high enough you can actually influence decisions of the company, and if they're doing worse than the day before, the value of your stock goes down. Then you sell it to somebody else. You don't actually make any money of any kind until you sell it but first it has to be worth more than it started as.

Is that how it works?"
