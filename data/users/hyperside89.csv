AmItheAsshole,ffd26eo,t3_esgzvt,1579811944.0,"YTA - I think I know you. I think I may have even dated your son, or someone very like you son. Let me guess, you think your nice, most likely white, upper middle class children are such a ""catch"" that any partner would want to trap them with a baby. I also suspect your son's girlfriend might not be as nice, white, and/or upper middle class as your family?"

IAmA,feo6g3o,t3_epvbq5,1579295798.0,Obi is so cute! I just wanted to share that. And I'm sorry this is happening to you and you are very very brave.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdr6vue,t1_fdr3nq0,1578680254.0,"Hahah - true. Pockets = gold. To be fair it was a gift. I also have ebay alerts set for ""mm lefleur"" and have found a few deals that way. I can tell you that dress is designed so well, and the fabric is lovely - I feel incredible and so so classy in it."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdqrlkt,t3_ems0cz,1578673377.0,"Great suggestion! And sorry for your loss. I hope your gran had a lovely life filled with love.

But I also want to suggest people shouldn't feel obligated to wear black to a funeral/buy a specific item of clothing for funerals. Of course, if you want to / feel that it would help with the grieving process then by all means do! Or if you feel strongly you don't want to keep clothes after a funeral (as others have suggested).

But in my opinion any dark colored understated outfit would do. I've personally wore a dark green sheath dress under a black blazer, a dark brown sweater with black slacks to various funerals and felt very appropriate. [This is currently my go to dress](https://mmlafleur.com/shop/etsuko-rosette) (which just happens to be black) for formal events (board meetings, speaking events, etc) and I suppose future funerals though I've been fortunate to not have any recently."
AmItheAsshole,fdnr97q,t3_ema2lf,1578591273.0,"YTA. Cats need to go to the vet, $300 for an initial visit is actually pretty reasonable. Pet insurance can be a great deal (assuming it's from a reputable provider and there aren't large loopholes in the coverage) in the case of an emergency / serious illness or just a really nice piece of mind even if there never is a need to use it. For me, and many people, $45 a month is very worth the piece of mind. 

Also you suck."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdhuhrf,t3_el57mp,1578430375.0,"Salad pro tip: use herbs as well as lettuce. For example, I love to do arugula and basil together as a base of some of my salads. Really pumps up the flavor. Next thing you know you'll be the woman with 3 basil plants growing in various places in your apartment. 

Salad pro tip #2: If you're going to use Kale, massage it. I know, I know, sounds like some crazy east coast NPR tote bag nonsense but for real, it will CHANGE YOUR SALAD. More details from [Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/massaging-kale). 

Finally two favorite salad recipes

**Winter Salad**

Base: Kale

Toppings: Goat cheese, cooked wild rice, diced red onion, dried cranberries, walnuts, diced apples 

Dressing: Balsamic vinaigrette 

**Summer Salad**

Base: Mixed greens and basil leaves

Toppings: Burrata (a yummy cheese similar to mozzarella), fresh chopped peaches, cherry tomatoes, diced red onion, toasted almonds.

Dressing: Balsamic vinaigrette."
MapPorn,fddq009,t1_fddjvkc,1578320864.0,"It is possible you are confusing Amish with Mennonite, which are closely related but distinct from each other. While they dress similarly (hence the confusion) Amish tend to be very resistant to technology whereas Mennonites are more moderate. There are also many other subtle differences.

This map doesn't give its source, but I suspect it's based off self reported numbers and/or potentially church registration."
AmItheAsshole,fd73yns,t3_ek3z80,1578199125.0,"NTA - just read the lyrics to the song.

CampingandHiking,fcxdj0z,t3_ej7cls,1578060029.0,"100% agree with other posters here that dogs should be leashed at all times to prevent situations like these. And yes, there are many irresponsible dog owners out there.

But also lets be a little empathic. At worst the owners already realized their huge mistake, and will probably feel guilty about it for their whole lives.

At best - we don't know the situation. Maybe the dogs were leashed, the leash was dropped and the dogs took off. Maybe a door was left open to a car and in a split second they were gone. I can imagine dozens of situations were leashed dogs can still got lost (hell mine jumped over a 6 foot fence once, that was a fun adventure to get him back - which I did, thanks goodness!)

Really hope for the sake of this family and their dogs they are found soon and safe."

YOU changed the rules of the wedding two days before. She didn't do anything besides respond to something YOU did. People are not obligated to accommodate changes made at the last minute."
AskHR,fcvauwh,t3_ej3u6k,1577998248.0,"According to [this article](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/california-passes-paid-sick-leave-law.html) (from 2015): ""California’s sick leave law allows employees to take sick leave for their own health condition or the health condition of a family member, including preventative treatment. “Family member” is defined broadly and includes a spouse, domestic partner, parent, child, parent-in-law, **grandparent**, grandchild, and sibling. Employees may also take sick leave if they are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.""

Most employers and employees are covered by the CA Law, it's pretty encompassing about who has to be covered. So unless something has changed since 2015, more than likely yes you can use your sick leave to care for your grandfather."
humanresources,fcv60nk,t3_ej2qf9,1577995367.0,"Oh boy - this is a complicated question. At it's simpliest I suggest the following:

\- Standardize when you do raises. I suggest annually for salaried employees, based on their hire date. If you don't standardize people will be pestering you for raises all the time, and people who bother you more may end up getting paid more which will create inequality.

\- You can stick with a standard percent structure: 2-3% for cost of living raise (depending on where you live and how must cost of living has changed in the past year), 3-5% for strong performers, 5% + for ""high performers"".

\- If you're going to make a distinction between strong and high performers (or whatever terminology you use) figure out a simple way to evaluate/explain the difference. You don't want ""gut"" judgement here, you want some clear and defensible metrics so you can explain to your employees why they are getting the raise they are (i.e. Sally, I'm really excited to off you a 4% raise this year due to you consistent on-time attendance, completing of projects ahead of deadlines, and your willingness to take on additional responsibilities in X and X area"" or ""Paul, I want to raise your salary 2% as a thank you for all your hard work in the past year. However, if you're interested in a larger raise in the future some areas you could focus on are on time attendance, taking on further responsibility in X area, etc.""

Best of luck!"
AmItheAsshole,fculk3h,t3_eiydga,1577983655.0,"NTA - I work in HR. Trust me, hiring and firing is a pain. in. the. ass. A company won't fire someone (and subsequently need to hire again) without a very good reason. And while his VERY racist behavior toward you is a very good reason, I highly doubt it was the only reason he was terminated. I suspect this was just one of many complaints against him.

Also did I mention, he was repeatedly hella racist? The company was heading into very risky ""hostile work environment"" if they ignored this behavior which is a HUGE company liability. I repeat, HIS behavior did this. Not you. If anything you saved the company from a big lawsuit in the future if he was treating any other employee in a similar manner."
Frugal,fcohi4c,t3_ei8oat,1577832350.0,"Those are both lovely dresses!

Personally though I've found it more worthwhile to pay full-price retail for a well made piece. I know I can sometimes find those at the thrift store, but most of the stuff I find now at my local goodwill is ""fast-fashion"" that I know will fall apart in 2-3 washes. It might be a big up front investment but $60 for a shirt I can wear for 5 years seems worth it to me."
relationships,fcnmk1z,t1_fcn1i2j,1577814338.0,"As said above, please please please do your neighbor the benefit of speaking with her before your landlord. It can be REALLY hard to find dog friendly housing, especially pit bull friendly housing, so giving her a chance to fix the problem before giving your landlord a reason to would be deeply appreciated by her I'm sure.

Working with a dog rescue, I've seen many dog end up the shelter because families lose their housing and can't find another option that will accept their dog. It's heartbreaking for everyone."
relationships,fcnmeq5,t1_fcn0dpy,1577814255.0,"In my experience, as a pitbull owner who rents, small private landlords have been much more accommodating and flexible than larger management companies. I never specifically asked about the insurance situation, but my own renters insurance has a personal liability section that specifically covers my dog (including his breed) and it wasn't much more than my renters insurance pre-dog so it is possible to find insurances that do cover any dog breed."
AmItheAsshole,fcl05kj,t1_fckdz47,1577736937.0,"But it is that simple. If you want to sit together pay the extra. Don't expect others to accommodate you. If they do, that's great - but they don't owe it to you."
humanresources,fbgrovj,t1_fbfa16f,1576857030.0,"That's great to hear! I'm glad it's working well for you! I really wish BambooHR could have worked for us, as I've heard such great things. But I think the key difference here is employees who work on computers and have access to BambooHR and email reminders at all times.

Our workforce is in the service industry, where our employees are not on computers and don't have company provided email addresses. When I demo'd BambooHR's time tracking it just didn't have the functionality for that kind of population yet, maybe it does now. It really did seem to be designed for a more office type workplace rather than perhaps a store or restaurant with a distributed workforce."
