I know that if I stopped training and went back to going to a regular gym like planet fitness or LA fitness I wouldn't last 2 weeks.

Steve Rogers someone else listed as why and I totally agree.

Wonder woman - her race is possibly flexible but you can't make a male with the same story. It just doesn't make sense.


Batman- without going some bullshit adoption angle Batman(Bruce Wayne) HAS  to be a white guy because you couldn't explain the Wayne family fortune existing since the early 1800s in the USA  and having it be a minority. Not without drastically changing history.


Luke Cage*  there is a caveat here. Luke cage COULD  be another race but if you were to change him and stay in Harlem he could be hispanic or *maybe* Asian. but the thing about luke cage is his story could work in a lot of different places in the world. So you could have a white luke cage but he'd have to be in like Serbia or like one of those impoverished countries in the eastern block.

At some point I just stopped caring that much. These days if I'm playing a fighting game it will be against a friend and no one else. No multilayer or anything like that anymore.

I've found now that I play more games where I'm  managing things such as franchise mode in a sports game or xcom or city builders(cities skylines, stardew valley).
