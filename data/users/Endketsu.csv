gayyoungold,ffi7rm2,t3_eto88x,1579967303.0,"Well you both agreed to be in monogamous relationship, but at some point your partner changed his mind or had some doubts, but instead of discussing these feelings with his partner (you) he decided to seek out and maybe even meet other guys.

However I can understand it can be quite uncomfortable to one day bring up such discussion with a partner that you have lived with for few years already.

So maybe don't go from 0 to 100 and dump him, but have a discussion about why is he behaving in such way, why isn't he satisfied in your relationship and try to figure out if you can understand his reasoning and do something together to improve. Also don't keep discussion one sided, tell him how this situation makes you feel and maybe it can help you understand your own feelings about him."

careerguidance,ff69aqt,t3_errzfy,1579622144.0,"This just my opinion and I'm not some career guru or anything.

From logical point of view it doesn't make sense for your boss to offer you opportunity to keep working in the firm/company if you really are that unqualified even if it is just out if politeness. He has seen you working already and has witnessed your performance. If you really are that bad then he would be wasting company's resources to pay you salary for tasks that won't reach the desired results. I may be wrong here, but your internship probably was more like an entry level job so your manager didn't expect any outstanding performance and you weren't given any really important tasks to handle. As I've said I may be wrong about this statement I don't know any details about your situation.

Besides even if your boss did make a mistake for giving you such offer it doesn't hurt to ask about it in private message to clarify things. Worst case scenario he will say that you are unqualified, but even then he should state that in somewhat respectful tone. He might even tell you what exactly you are lacking so you could know on what you should work on to improve before applying again"
