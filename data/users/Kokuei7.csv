memes,ffi31zu,t1_ffi2xvw,1579963634.0,Pretty much this meme template in a nutshell.
memes,ffeumhz,t3_et6y3i,1579866256.0,"I play on PC and console and you know what I love the most about consoles? That over its entire life when I buy I game I can start it knowing that it'll work without me needing to do anything.

As for what I love about PCs: the library and the fact that I can mod the hell out of anything and even the older games will look beautiful, so long as I'm willing to play around and get things working."
AnimalCrossing,ff5tfn8,t3_erroq9,1579609582.0,This slow drip feed of content is keeping me going until the game comes out. Thank you.
barkour,ff5otnt,t3_erka7g,1579603782.0,"He is a gorgeous, clever boy! I have never met him but I love him so much, these videos always make me smile."
AskUK,ff5mpwj,t1_ff40om0,1579600600.0,I will! :)
AskUK,ff40ejf,t1_ff3z58k,1579552813.0,"I didn't know about this, thanks a lot!"
AskUK,ff3w49m,t1_ff3vqyb,1579550138.0,"No worries, I appreciated your answers And you helped me find a good website. Enjoy the rest of your evening!"
AskUK,ff3vlul,t1_ff3laiz,1579549818.0,Thank you so much for your patience with me :) That's really good advice.
AskUK,ff3vf6t,t1_ff3t9hz,1579549704.0,That's a great idea! Thsnk you very much :)
AskUK,ff3sd6f,t1_ff3rqqy,1579547811.0,"I can yes, comfortably."
AskUK,ff3ogdp,t1_ff3mb0f,1579545422.0,Ah I've never been to Butlins. I'll look that up as well as cruises. Thanks!
AskUK,ff3odjw,t1_ff3m8sy,1579545374.0,"Thank you, this never crossed my mind. I'll be looking them up."
AskUK,ff3oc0s,t1_ff3l2yk,1579545349.0,I never thought of a cruise! I'll look into that. And good to know that you can both have a great time with each other away :)
AskUK,ff3kyz5,t1_ff3kemb,1579543269.0,Sorry I don't mean to contradict myself like that. The website you have is good for accessible hotels and flight transfers but I'm thinking about kinds of activities. I'll have a harder think.
AskUK,ff3k6um,t1_ff3ji9j,1579542792.0," I searched ""how to enjoy your holiday"" and ""what to do on holiday"". And all I got were things like turn your phone off, don't check in with work etc.

Thanks for the link. It's not the disabled part alone I'm struggling with, I genuinely am not sure what to do on holiday or to get into the mindset so I thought I'd reach out."
Breath_of_the_Wild,fexapye,t3_eqkm0n,1579427810.0,Absolutely brilliant.
cfs,fedp5u4,t1_fedo2tl,1579016861.0,That's so odd to me. Sorry I meant my comment as more of a statement of disbelief than to question you specifically. I really hope this kicks up a lot of fuss!
cfs,fed92jk,t3_eof2te,1579004231.0,Are they allowed to do that? Just say no? Terrible news for anyone with ME over there.
ShinyPokemon,fed8y0z,t3_eodm0g,1579004097.0,That's dedication!
childfree,fds6oy8,t3_emohwz,1578695576.0,"I've read this after your edit and even though you say you'd be in an apartment for the week and not abandon your wife, you're essentially leaving her to deal with the entire parental burden on her own for most of the week. It might make things easier for you and your work, but I couldn't imagine being an unhappy mother losing my closest support and adult contact because they needed a break. When does she get a break?

You seem to be treating a monumental decision as something that just happened to you and you're surprised that things are difficult? On the fence or not this was a serious decision that you both made. I think you both need to speak to a professional therapist or your doctor about how your lives have changed, think either of you are happy and work out what you both want and are capable of. I'm not a fan of kids but it doesn't really matter here; I feel very sorry for them having parents that don't seem to want them. Hopefully you can both work past this."
cfs,fdplpap,t3_emk1so,1578632138.0,"I know it's hard to feel like a ""good"" member of society but, quoting God of War here, you are not to blame for your sickness. We have much more value in life than what we can produce or sell. Other people don't get to decide if we're worthy or not!

Personally I flip flop from feeling guilty to content a lot, but I've been in a content mood for a a little while. I recognise having people who understand and support you (and other things) will contribute to this, but from a random internet stranger I believe that you are enough and that your achievements, no matter how small, are something to be happy about. I hope you're okay.

I've had about a month where I couldn't tidy up after myself let alone attempt to clean the house, but I brushed my teeth every day and I'm counting that as a win. Yesterday I cleaned the bath which I think is why I can't sleep right now with my ears ringing and body hurting as I'm in bed, but that's a massive accomplishment and I'm going to treat it like one even if I still live in a mess right now :) Maybe I'll be feeling guilty about this when my mood drops, but for now I'm not letting anyone take this from me!"
yesyesyesno,fdoy8vd,t1_fdor06v,1578615615.0,"Yeah I've seen this happen to a few of their comics, someone's not a fan of the style I guess but it's sad they get shared instead of the one the artist actually made. Personally I'd rather see the original, but OP might not have known there was one."
barkour,fdoxr6s,t3_emck9p,1578615297.0,"I love this pup's adorable face! Please tell me he got s lots of pets too, I think I might just melt :)"
pokemontrades,fdov2u4,t1_fdothus,1578613538.0,"Thanks a lot, I have so many now! Such a nice end to the day :)"
pokemontrades,fdoto3t,t1_fdothus,1578612624.0,I do! Let me just set up some trades with them and I'll jump back on the same code.
pokemontrades,fdotjx4,t1_fdothus,1578612551.0,I think I do. Let me just check my items now.
pokemontrades,fdot667,t1_fdot2bo,1578612311.0,"I only have two! The only other thing I've got is XL Candy, so happy to do just the first 4 if it's not enough."
pokemontrades,fdossfu,t1_fdoso1a,1578612069.0,"Sure thing, I'll trade on 5991."
pokemontrades,fdosj12,t1_fdos9jk,1578611905.0,Happy to get you the band and specs. I've also got PP Max and XL Candy on me right now.
pokemontrades,fdorurz,t1_fdorkpt,1578611487.0,"Hey, sorry I'm afraid I don't have a masterball. Thanks so much for the offer though."
pokemontrades,fdoqtio,t1_fdoozz1,1578610828.0,"Oh silly me, I forgot it's not a BP item this time around. Sorry but I'm afraid I can't give you either."
barkour,fcv5to7,t3_ej2w7c,1577995252.0,They're fearless! How lovely to have a furry buddy to share your hobby with.
ZeroWaste,fcs0qsf,t3_eii6db,1577909592.0,"Love the pattern, you've got a great eye!"
