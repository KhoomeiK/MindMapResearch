Accounting,ffai2ve,t1_ffaavj3,1579736243.0,"If you receive something it can be an asset, such as a car, you actually get the car. It could be rent for 2 months, so you actually receive use of a house etc. It's an expense, not an asset (not a thing you own per se) but still something you have use of. 

Credits are giving it away. Sales are stuff you no longer have, it's gone for that price. Liabilities are stuff you owe, you gotta pay that off. Equity is all the profit left over that the business owes to its owner(s). So they owe it. 

And, if you're thinking about it as in Receiving/giving, the other side reduces it. So if I credit an Asset, I'm reducing it, as you would when you buy something for cash, because I'm giving away that cash.

It's easier to think of it not in a ""why"" way but ""What"". 

So if I buy a car on credit, first thing I know is I got a car. So that's an asset, put that as a Dr. Then I know I got it on credit, and know I need a Cr to balance that out, and what would you know it's a liability. So Cr the liability. 

Then perhaps there's interest on it. I know I'll end up owing more, so use Cr to increase the liability, and the Dr has to go somewhere, and it goes to the interest code. As a Debit, to balance it. 

If you just learn what things are, which shouldn't take long, then sort the easiest thing first and chase the rest along, it gets to the point where it's instinct.

If needs be remember Dead Clic for increasing.

Hatfilms,ff9oelr,t3_esfvt1,1579717243.0,"Great to see the boiks playing Terraria again, even if they very clearly have no clue what they're doing. 

If I were them (or they're reading this) I'd do a few things:

Get a loom, sawmill, and then a bed up to set your spawn. 

Holding shift over an object automatically uses the item required to break it, such as pickaxe for dirt then a torch if you do it over air, meaning you don't have to select the tool. 

Get someone like Lewis or Tom on for a stream or something, or look up roughly what you need to do next. 

Terraria has an *insane* amount of really interesting and diverse content. The first bit is just the beginning. You can ride unicorns and fire rainbow cannons if you wish, and this is before mods become involved. So helping yourself get past this first stage is key."

We don't learn form history if we hide it away, and shun it. 

For instance, the example I gave, the dude wasn't a monster and was well loved at the time. If we assume those men in the statues were all monsters and forget the good they did, we lose the nuance, and become less able to spot similar situations in current times. 

It's more of a chipping away at the critical skills history provides, and therefore failing to learn from it and use that in modern times, than losing the actual dates, names, and places."

todayilearned,fekrlfo,t1_fekqwji,1579206154.0,"Tanks aren't just what they are on paper. 

They also have to work in the field. While the Tiger was along the lines of the best tank the Germans could make for their strategy, on paper, it had massive flaws and ultimately wasn't what they needed.

The T34 was *exactly* what the Russians needed and did the job spectacularly, due to its design. Even though the design was worse, the design was *cheap* allowing them to just flood the Germans with tanks that, in combat, weren't actually that much worse performance wise.

For other examples, the Sherman gets a bad rep for being outdated, which in theory it sort of was, but in practice it wasn't. At all. (Also, it wasn't a deathtrap either.) But by taking a long dev cycle they could be sure the tanks they made in the US and shipped over wouldn't need to be sent back over for repair etc, like the Germans and Soviets could do. So it was far more useful than it was on paper.

The Japanese Tanks get a bad rep, but they were light and easily deployable to Islands, which was crucial early war. The Lee looks awful on paper too, but was ample against these tanks, cheap, and was built very quickly when the US were desperate for tanks. It wasn't useless, like it looks on paper."

There was little actually constructed on them to go wrong, (to the point where they didn't bother to properly rivet the tracks - the track pins, should they come out, were knocked back in by a plate on the hull) but the engines were complete trash designed to last no more than standard service life, once they worked out what that was.

The phrase Audit Monkey exists for a reason. You send them to go and do the grunt work, as they're cheap and lower level staff. This gets reviewed by the senior, on site or back in office. 

So what you end up with is staff having no fucking clue what they're doing who either A) know that and admit it or B) bullshit their way through it because they're either confident or don't want to make the firm look bad.

UKPersonalFinance,fd68q15,t1_fd2x53t,1578187226.0,"Another issue is the letting agents. 

I've had several agents flat out misrepresent a situation to make us look bad, or to make the situation sound less serious, as to not fuss the Landlord/make them look better. For instance one said ""Oh we've talked to the landlord he's ok with us sorting it."" after a *month* with them failing to replace our oven properly. One phone call to the landlord and it was replaced 2 days later, with an apology. Another agency didn't report the fact that there was *water coming out of my extractor fan from what looked like the upstairs loo* to the landlord, they just said that we'd broken the toilet. So naturally the landlord was reluctant to have the floor ripped up and the pipes fixed, because all they were told was that it was the toilet. It was not. And the agent knew it was not. 

A lot of Landlords just want problems sorted and fixed, they want their money for less hassle. Kicking someone out over a month's rent they can't make isn't worth it if they can at least pay *some*, you won't get a replacement tenant for less or in time, and if they then move in to another one of your smaller properties, you haven't had to advertise for it. Or get an agent to find someone. Fixing something quickly if it's just wear and tear leads to less cost down the line. Even if they're completely lacking humanity and empathy, it's still easier and better that way.

In my experience it's often the letting agents being in the way, and not quite portraying the situation properly, that causes issues more than shit landlords. But when it comes back to us as a reason, they use the landlord as the reason."
