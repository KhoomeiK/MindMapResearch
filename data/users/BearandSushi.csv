niceguys,ff3jzp6,t1_ff3edjg,1579542672.0,Yea having a family is a priority for some people and I dont mind it being brought up on the first date. But holy shit straight up fantasizing outlout to your date??? Not to mentioned complaining about the check. Blows my mind how some people are so clueless.
Whatcouldgowrong,ff071i1,t1_ff064ez,1579465846.0,For sure. Not to mention asian american or asians living overseas have drastically different cultures than those in actual Asia too.
LookImAFirefighter,ff032v3,t1_fezqvud,1579464677.0,Yea all firefighter wedding pictures are stuck in between being cute and being cringe
Whatcouldgowrong,feztn44,t1_feznd2x,1579461510.0,"Idk dude i had friends that were pretty well off and most of them were taught that their wealth isn't gonna last if they don't work hard. And they were Asians too. Their parents had to work for their wealth so they are pretty strict with their kids and has insanely high expectations. 

Some people are just idiots. Saying that every rich person has the same upbringing therefore ""culture"" is to blame is kind of unfair."
LookImAFirefighter,fez7pwh,t3_eqy0mk,1579454551.0,Idk i think it's kinda cute
dankchristianmemes,fexepoz,t1_fewuojv,1579429781.0,"No you're getting downvoted because I'm sure everyone knows that every service job got a bunch of people fake being happy. Like what's the point of bragging about being fake nice to people though? What was the reaction you want? ""Yea! Fuck chick fil a! Everyone that works there just wants to get pay! They actually don't care if I'm happy with my life or not! :(("""

MadeMeSmile,fe68orb,t1_fe5fw0e,1578884222.0,Didn't know we were speaking of statistics when you literally just pulled your entire first comment out of your ass without any statistics or even anecdotes but okayyyyyy
MadeMeSmile,fe5f4b0,t1_fe4xfyu,1578868713.0,"I said in my area and when i said a lot I didn't mean having more but you really just looked that stat up to try to prove me wrong lmao. 

And yea different cars are definitely market towards different people for sure. It would make more sense that maybe females are more sensible when buying cars and don't want to dump their hard earned money towards a car that looks cool when there are cheaper and more reliable alternatives.

Also Thunderbird and Hummer are both discountinued sooooooooo"
MadeMeSmile,fe4v7be,t1_fe4dri2,1578863111.0,"In my area i see lots of women drives Hummer and Jeep. Just a guess here also but they probably wants something that's exactly as you described, bigger, more powerful, more physically imposing because they want to let people know that just because they're woman they don't need to drive little cars. I see where you're coming from but it just doesn't really apply to cars because everyone knows that a lot of guys like small but fast muscle cars."

notliketheothergirls,fdqmp82,t1_fdprm0v,1578670311.0,For sure. Being a nurturing mother is honestly one of the biggest accomplishment in my mind. Like knowing you raised that person that won a prestigious award gotta be a different kind of proud.
Wholesomecringe,fdnvoje,t3_em9dti,1578593787.0,Sailor Uranus was also one of the first non binary anime character of her time.
dankchristianmemes,fdbqy73,t1_fdal0hj,1578260492.0,There's a reason why this meme say r/atheism and not atheism. Unless you're saying r/atheism represent all of atheism.

 Also you should update your reddit profile because it said that you're a math and physic undergrad but you're also a teacher? I can't even begin to imagine how smart you have to be for that."

niceguys,fcv74dc,t1_fcutpmg,1577996022.0,"No hate from me yo i'm trying my best to understand. I know you think you are reasonable and definitely don't need help but I seriously suggest you do some self-reflection. It seem like you are also surround by a giant circle jerk who thinks like you and maybe that's the problem. If you know people don't like to be constantly explained to why are you doing it? And I don't think you know what being ""well-versed"" in conversation means. Knowing a lot of things to talk about isn't being well-versed in conversation. Only talking about the things you're interested in isn't being well-versed in conversation. Steering a conversation in the direction you want to isn't you being a driver, it is you grabbing the wheel from the passenger side and wondering why the car is running off the road. Imagine we're discussing our lives and then suddenly ""ah yes that reminds me of this particular verse in Dante's Divine Comedy, which if you didn't know by the way is a truly masterful piece of literature in which me and my well-read buddies like to ruminate about on a boring day""(which would never happen of course because why would you ever read something that affirms God is real) Like...uuhhhhhhuhh okayyy. And then you think to your self ""Damn it if God is real...how could he cursed me with such amazing conservational skills that no girls could ever keep up with me??..Ah...such is a life of a higher educated gentleman""

DM me for more hypothetical car crashes you may get yourself into."
bulletjournal,fcv3zg1,t1_fcv30hy,1577994169.0,Thank you this is very helpful! I don't care for bright white pages either. Does the Exceed lay flat? Have you try using fountain pens ink on them?
Cringetopia,fcv3714,t1_fcv1lky,1577993704.0,Misunderstood probably. I meant to say it is GOOD that these wholesome comics are made and it is a much better response than just sending hate.
bulletjournal,fcv33p8,t1_fcuxhyx,1577993649.0,Thanks for letting me know! I just buy whatever looks pretty tbh :) I have a few cheap craft stores bullet ones that write pretty decently.

AmItheAsshole,fcb1njd,t1_fcagozf,1577580971.0,Yea you're right... A bit harsh. I would like to see her painting first. Because what if its just a traced art piece of all the thing she likes? And idk where everyone lived where gift giving is as easy as typing in stuff on amazon and buying it. There's a lot that goes into it like will this be something OP can use? This is something she likes but is this something that she would like to have? Giving a painting is just so risky.
AmItheAsshole,fcafxry,t1_fca9x8y,1577568549.0,"If OP painted all the things she liked on a shirt that would have been a better gift. 

To some people Artistic effort is better appreciated when it comes from someone personal imo. Not everyone is into arts and crafts like that. Just because it's handmade doesn't mean it's good nor thoughtful."
AmItheAsshole,fcaf3uf,t1_fcaaj4y,1577568152.0,"Yea that's true. I do think it is pretty bad mannered to called someone out for their gift but...idk... I'd still like to see the painting first. And it's already said somewhere on here, creative efforts are better appreciated when it's coming from someone you know"
AmItheAsshole,fcabhb2,t1_fca0s4m,1577566160.0,Exactly! So did OP say it in a respectful way or did OP was bitter about it because they were angry?
AmItheAsshole,fca7se6,t1_fc9xuyr,1577564346.0,"""made a painting of all the things she said she likes"" if OP didn't say she likes handmade painting/paintings then this is not a fitting gift at all. It's low effort to just... Send a picture of all the things they like instead of getting something they actually like."

Nicegirls,fc35n9p,t1_fc2tnfn,1577382039.0,Yea but this man is making the argument that guys like that won't go for her because she is not attractive/feminine enough but in reality it's also because she has a shit personally so I'd say neither of them are right.
AskTrumpSupporters,fc34q90,t1_fc2y2tw,1577381381.0,Ironically enough I knew a buddy who was a huge Obama fan and the only thing she didn't like about Michelle Obama was because she tried to get healthier foods in school.

I was looking at the Archer and Olive grid notebooks, those are nice and thick but I would sacrifice the thickness if the price was a bit lower since I'll use it for pretty casual note-taking."
notebooks,fc0y71v,t1_fc0vkcq,1577302890.0,For the grid one i would use felt pens and gel pens. If you got any types that are fountain pens friendly i'd like to know as well.
