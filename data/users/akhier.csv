It doesn't drag you out of the game with a prompt for if you want to learn or not. Just a simple check for if you have shown the ability to do so already.

bestoflegaladvice,ff5ju4l,t1_ff5gsxa,1579596282.0,"Except many jobs are unskilled labor and of those jobs most are worked by the poor. Removing the job doesn't force them to train for something else, it removes the only job they can do and they don't have the money to pay for training or the time looking for a job. Way too many people work paycheck to paycheck.

Not that I think automation is all doom and gloom. I look forward to it but during the transition things are going to hellish unless politicians stop playing politics and start helping the populace."

news,ff2ctn2,t1_ff29qqj,1579501018.0,"Honestly the biggest problem in the end isn't any of this political stuff. Rather it is that we make our rules and laws based on whatever gets more votes from people who have no clue what they voted for would do. You can just look 'across the pond' at the whole Brexit nonsense.

Raising the minimum wage wouldn't cause the cost of living to magically raise to infinite because of other jobs deciding to raise their wages as well. What would happen is there would be less jobs. This is why despite so many politicians going on about it nothing has ever really been done. Same with removing the minimum wage. More jobs wouldn't magically appear. Rather the number of jobs would stay about the same and the lowest skill jobs would just have new people being hired for a lower wage. McDonalds isn't going to suddenly return their fancy new drink machine that can dispense a hundred different variations of coke just so they can hire some kid on at 3 an hour to do it instead.

It is sort of a catch 22 with voting. To get better results out of elections we would need smarter more savvy people be the ones who vote. I notice a lot of nonsense that politicians do to earn more voters and can look beyond that at what their actually policies are (and almost more important, how often they follow through on it) and I am by far hardly all that savvy when it comes to politics. On the other hand we need everyone to vote or else we are creating another situation like we were in when African Americans and Women couldn't vote. People need representation but so much of the system now has been geared towards keeping the masses ignorant while lining the politicians pockets."
news,ff29mmq,t1_ff283fa,1579497904.0,Except of course minimum wage is there in the first place because of things like sweatshops. It is there to protect us and the reason those companies are turning to illegal immigrants is because they aren't protected. If you abolished it then they would treat EVERYONE badly. It wouldn't suddenly be all sunshine and roses for the illegals. In fact the minimum wage needs to be raised to match the cost of living.

movies,fessn2g,t1_fesqtnw,1579368604.0,The little theaters are complaining that Amazon and company are driving them out of business. This isn't entirely false but doesn't cover the full reason they are failing. The above comment was pointing out that they aren't going to the movies because the experience was bad. Honestly I think it shows that Amazon and others are just providing a better service experience which is what a theater really is. The movie isn't the product anymore.

SS13,feofyk0,t1_feofcmf,1579299597.0,Multitools are nice but I have found remote signalers are better for hacking vending machines. You don't need to worry about being shocked as you can just stand away from the machine and with so few options you find the contraband option quickly. Just a screwdriver and two or three signalers will do.

gaming,fdfbjfh,t1_fdf8hxn,1578357810.0,His comic is the same as when a stand-up comedian comments on how they flew in and what about that airline food? Anyone who has flown and had the food they serve knows it isn't stellar and are able to laugh about it. This is the same sort of thing but with a specific subset of gamer culture.
gaming,fdf1d4x,t1_fdf0igx,1578351095.0,"It is observational humor. Been around for forever and quite popular. Comics, stand-up, TV and movies. Just because you don't like the subject doesn't make it bad. For many people Mario party causes situations like this so to see fictional characters affected by it give them a nice laugh. If you have ever laughed at someone going through a situation you've been through that was this joke but on a different subject you happened to be attached to."

SS13,fdd3spy,t3_ekq94m,1578293607.0,"ddos stands for distributed denial of service.  The way it works is that a server can only respond to so many things at once and a ddos attack overloads it thus denies others service. The distributed part comes from the fact that these attacks are carried out not by a single device but many. General this group of devices, called a bot swarm, are hacked devices being targeted by the hacker. The reason I say devices and not computers is because anything on the internet can be used so all those smart TVs, fridges, and lights can be used as well and they have weak sauce protection from hacking.

To put it another way the server is a person trying to talk to you but someone tied bells to all the crazy lady from down the streets cats and sent them his way so he can't hear you over the racket."
