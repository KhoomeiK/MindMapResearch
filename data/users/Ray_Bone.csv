When terrorist organisations like ISIS detonate a bomb in New York, you can't just nuke every ISIS location/country where ISIS wrecks havoc. And they wouldn't really care about that since they tend to suicide bomb themselves when they don't slaughter civilians in there countries already. They just see the victory in nuking an American city.

>can they be smuggled?

Humans get smuggled in the US. Drugs get smuggled in the US. Why not bomb parts? It's enough to smuggle in the enriched uranium/plutonium and maybe the explosives that you need to trigger the fission reaction. They rest can probably be buyed in one Walmart trip. A bit of electronics, some metal parts: Tadaa! You can nuke the entirety of Los Angeles. Or New York. Or even Washington.

It's all about the nuclear material. That's the hardest part to get and where everyone failed. For now."
AskReddit,ffiay56,t1_ffi8awt,1579969534.0,"It just meant as an ""short time span"" with a higher possibility. Terrorists can attack any time with such weapons if they acquire the needed materials.

You can't blame them really for there thoughts/ideas. It just sad to see how they want to arm themselves with some of the most cruel and destructive weapon type on this planet. [The less of these weapons the better.](https://youtu.be/5iPH-br_eJQ)"

That's the problem I see. We had that fiasco already when Kimmy Boi wasn't seen for some time because of his medical condition. Who gets into control when he dies? What happens when a civil war or just anarchy sweep over NK? Or what happens when suddenly one day a revolution breaks out? The people are to some degree brainwashed into hating the ""American Imperialists"".

AskReddit,ffi369r,t1_ffi13ye,1579963735.0,"The poster reinforces his idea of an nuclear-armed Iran with nationalistic-ideological ideas of an bad Western world that wants to destroy Iran and that nuclear weapons are the only way to fend them of.

""Why should an Iranian not want nuclear weapons?""

Because he thinks critical about his country? Because he can think rational and doesn't want to live in a Islamic dictatorship that uses the bad history between the US and Iran to brainwash its people? Like I said: The poster is a nationalist. Long-term thinking about consequences isn't really the biggest strength of nationalists. Nationalistic beliefs in the US led to today's situation in the Middle East/Iran. And all those nations are too dumb to fix that situation on a diplomatic way nowadays. Somehow also because of there nationalistic beliefs.

Technically, this entire discussion is senseless. We just can drink tea and watch what happens next anyways."

AskReddit,ffi0gyk,t1_ffhymaf,1579961298.0,"No, because the Middle East ISN'T one homogenous region. You don't know the future consequences of such an development in this region. Maybe nations like Saudi Arabia would suddenly develop also an interest in Nuclear weapons. Maybe the country breaks down one day because of inner political tensions and every militia in the region gets there hands on WMDs. Maybe an total fanatic becomes the supreme leader in the future and nukes Israel and maybe the US because he hate this nations. Anything is possible. They are already too many nuclear powers in the world. That number must not grow in near future."

It's true that the US fucked up Iran in the Cold war with there involvement in the coups/regime changes. But that was not the topic we talked about.

Oh, and how do I dare to say something bad about the spread of WMDs as a form of getting attention? ""There is nothing bad about having these weapons because East and West didn't nuked each other in the cold war?"" Bullshit. You never know how countries with access to such weapons handle different ""threats"".

""It is about science, technology and progress"". Sure, North Korea's citizens now live in paradise since there regime developed that weapons.
