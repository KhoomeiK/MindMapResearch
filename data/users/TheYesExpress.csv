Releasing a trigger point requires one to first find a sensitive, tender, or painful point in a given area. 
-So for a female, I would place my hand over hers and ask her to gently press on different parts of her groin area(the crease above the thigh). 
-Once a spot is identified, I apply pressure and ask if the female client is feeling sensation elsewhere(referral pain). 
-I apply pressure on both points for 30 seconds and then I release. How many times I repeat this depends on the tightness of the trigger point. 

There’s definitely more to releasing a trigger point in the groin area than I just summarized(for example: prior range of motion assessments and tailored take-home exercises), but at least this gives you an idea of what is being done. 

If you’re still interested, here’s a self-treatment video by Kai Simon that shows you some techniques for hip/groin pain :)

Doing trigger point release exercises can help release the tension in these areas and create space for muscle movement. The release can help with hip pain, leg pain, and can also make having an orgasm more tangible."

Thank you for this constructive conversation."
wholesomememes,fggrht0,t1_fggop3t,1580767939.0,"Transgender is a fairly new field. OF COURSE scientists are going to do the minimal research and label it a mental disorder. 

Did you know that there are researchers studying the Y chromosome that have found that mutations happen during the washing stage of the Y chromosome that have strong links that determine if a person is homosexual or not?

https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/feb/14/genes-influence-male-sexual-orientation-study

Yet there are still numerous studies that claim being homosexual is a mental illness as well. 

Science and labels can change over time as new discoveries are made, and new perspectives are brought in. 

I’m not transgender. I don’t have any close loved ones who are. I’m also not a scientist or a genetics specialist, so this topic isn’t particularly personal for me. 
But I am human and I do care. 
I can speak from a place of virtue because I know and believe that being different shouldn’t be considered sick. A person being trans has zero effect on me or my life because these are regular people just trying to live life.

So you’re damn right I’m going to “normalize” it every single chance I get. These are people’s lives. And their lives matter just as much as mine."

wholesomememes,fggmdvf,t1_fggln7y,1580764881.0,"It is only your opinion that it is a mental illness. 
If your child told you they felt different and that they(assuming they were born female), felt more masculine than other females, why would you think they are mentally ill? 
Why would you perpetuate the narrative that simply being and feeling different somehow makes you sick? 

You could have a wonderful child that just wants to express themself while knowing, undeniably, that they have your love and support. 
Why ruin something so beautiful just because you do not understand it?"

wholesomememes,fggesqi,t1_fgg8ls6,1580760364.0,"Pessimism gets you no where. 
I can’t imagine having carried a child for 9 months, having raised them to the best of my abilities, having taught them to love unconditionally, JUST to disown and not accept them in the end. 

I’m sure the trans issue is hard on the parents, but imagine truly believing you were born in the wrong body and having to either live in a lie or live where no one accepts you. Now THAT’S hard. 

It’s time to grow up."
wholesomememes,fgg8ls6,t3_ey862q,1580756590.0,It’s that frikken easy. Accept your children for who they are(or who they are exploring within themselves) because they have to accept you as their parent. It’s that simple.

I don’t expect non-regular customers to go to Starbucks and know the complete lingo, but I think it’s fair to ask people to be more specific with what they mean. 

Just because “regular” means something at one spot you’ve been to, doesn’t mean it means the same at a completely different spot. I’d say that’s just common sense, but it seems common sense is a bit lacking these days. 

So next time you’re unsure of a stores lingo or something as simple as cup sizes...read the menu."
