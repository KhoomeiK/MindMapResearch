WisconsinBadgers,fgst2t9,t1_fgsroc8,1581092073.0,"Compares how he handles a situation to how King did. Point out there situations aren’t the same (a point he originally made himself) and instead of addressing the point he turns to misrepresentation. It’s a pretty standard bait and switch for someone who knows they are beat. 

Why continue to argue the point when you can misdirect the argument into something more easily defeated?"
WisconsinBadgers,fgsonx4,t1_fgso4pr,1581089340.0,"Straw man:

noun
1.
an intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent's real argument.


Red herring:

Red herring is a kind of fallacy that is an irrelevant topic introduced in an argument to divert the attention of listeners or readers from the original issue.

I’m gonna guess and after hominem is next since you can’t really help yourself."
WisconsinBadgers,fgsoihv,t1_fgso4pr,1581089243.0,Nice red herring! Wow do you specialize in logical fallacies?
WisconsinBadgers,fgso24d,t1_fgseecr,1581088952.0,"Nice straw man. I can’t tell if you lack reading comprehension, are projecting, or are purposefully misrepresenting what I said."
WisconsinBadgers,fgsd2fe,t1_fgscu2s,1581080894.0,That’s not at all what I’m saying. If you think your own personal experience has any bearing on this kids good luck.

WisconsinBadgers,fgsanb1,t1_fgsaj2e,1581078661.0,He can be opportunistic and the trainer can be wrong. It’s not mutually exclusive...
WisconsinBadgers,fgsalsa,t1_fgsaeqy,1581078619.0,"Except your job isn’t public facing. In fact as you point out it’s nothing like Kings. 

So not sure why you are taking your own experience and trying to use it to explain a situation that’s completely unlike your own."
WisconsinBadgers,fgsaepv,t1_fgrq6wv,1581078426.0,"He’s not using it as a reason to transfer. 

In the NCAA you have to sit out a year after transferring. There was a player last season that was able to get that year waived because allegedly someone on the team called him a racial slur. 

King had already decided to transfer. He even thanked the man in question in his goodbye post. He’s then told he needs to sit out a year. Now he can claim the same thing the student did last year and not have to sit out. 

I think people feel he was being opportunistic."
WisconsinBadgers,fgsa5m5,t1_fgrhc3c,1581078171.0,"There’s a big difference between saying you appreciate the opportunity to your boss. 

It’s completely different to take the time out of your day to post that on social media. 

I doubt you would take to Facebook and say the same thing unless it’s true. Otherwise why waste your time."

AskReddit,fgkbmug,t3_eyrt0y,1580861804.0,"One of the best questions to ask is what concerns if any do you have with my ability to do well in this role?

It gives you a chance to hear any objections they have which can give you an idea of how the interview went. 

It also gives you a chance to refute their objections. Shows you can take feedback. Also shows them you can think on your feet.

todayilearned,fgjx78h,t1_fgik5mv,1580853139.0,"From the interview I heard it sounds like he wasn’t that far gone into the bottle but knew proactively that he had a problem and cut it off before it became too debilitating. 

If that is the case that’s really impressive and you’d have to believe he had a good support system while growing up a star."

Edit: oh I see you are a white nationalist who believes the white man is being stomped out by brown people. Brown person here, thanks for the job lol...

Also the way your framed family really echoes what Daryl Davis was saying. It’s funny how you try to frame your bile in such a way that it comes off as something more palatable. Probably a powerful way to try and recruit."

sports,fgcb6zm,t1_fg9moex,1580670973.0,"I think his point is that if you didn’t want to leave it in the refs hands you should have scored more. I don’t necessarily agree with that although I do think it’s sport dependent. 

Boxing and MMA for example. We know how crazy judges can score fights so often times you don’t really want to leave it up to the judges. That’s not entirely the same thing though as judges and refs are really equivalent."

In your specific case you were being stalked. That’s not what your LPT is about though. It’s about people witnessing petty crimes and recording them and going to the prosecutor directly and bypassing the police. 

It makes me think of a bunch of preschoolers who just can’t wait to tell on each other. 

It’s not your job to police others. That shouldn’t even need to be stated."
