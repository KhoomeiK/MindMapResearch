And yes, I realize the whole multiverse is just a money making machine, but I still wish it wasnt. I was left disappointed with the finale (Endgame), hell, I wasnt even remotely sad about Stark dying, because IMO they ruined him in Civil War (Iron man was my favorite upto that movie, but his position in Civil War was just so fucking hypocritical, the guy came out as Iron Man just because he is an ego-maniac and loves the attention, but feels that its ok to force others to reveal their identities as well)."

Imagine roulette. You only have 1/37 chance of winning, or one could say ""out of 37 futures, you win only in one"". BUT HERE IS THE THING - if I had the ability to look into the future Id be able to instantly know for sure what it takes to win. You dont need to ""find that one perfect plan"", you can just fix any of the other ones by eradicating the reason their failed in the first place. 

Another example, you put me in the ring with prime Mike Tyson. The only ""futures"" where Id win would be the ones where Tyson randomly gets a heart attack or slips and breaks his neck or smth. BUT if I was able to read his first move by looking into the future, I would stand a chance of winning, as Id be able to perfectly counter his first move (as Id be prepared for it) and maybe get a good shot and KO him.

MurderedByWords,fd5f2qw,t1_fd556f4,1578176997.0,"> Do you really think that being so obsessed with how others perceive you 

I dont care how ""others"" perceive me, I care about how **I** see myself, or how people who I respect see me (there arent that many). The opinion of the average person means nothing to me. Or do you actually think being all kinds of -phobic in today's ""lets tolerate everything"" world is making me look ""cool"" or something? Clearly, I am willing to be ""the unpopular one"" if that's the consequence of standing by my views.

> that you must spend every moment pushing others down, 

You know how there are so many quotes about how great revenge is? People enjoy hurting those who hurt them. So do I, its just that someone being annoying is reason enough to make me want to hurt them. And once I do, I will feel good about it. Hell, to this day I have great memories of fucking people over just because they pissed me off in some way. 

Its not about pushing others, like id never pick on someone that is trying to stay out of my way (like how bullies are portrayed often, picking on some kid who is trying to be invisible in the first place), or randomly try to hurt a person I dont know. Its just that I genuinely enjoy putting down those who made my day even a little bit worse. 

> There is nothing less manly than homophobia 

And we come back to this. I really didnt care about gays in any way like 10 years ago. Its when all those fucking movements started happening, and faggots started appearing left and right in every outlet of media, basically forcing me to watch them (like lets say I liked a TV Show, and then they introduced a gay character, its not really forcing, but Id have to quit something I like to avoid it), that I started hating them. Same thing with women actually. 

Homosexuality is the least manly thing there is. Our main biologically wired function is to get a woman pregnant. Its the most important reason men exist (same for women, just their reason is to **get** pregnant). Every man will eventually feel the need to fuck a girl, no matter what they parents or upbringing was. 

If you are gay, you are already not a real man, you are just nature's mistake. Also, the sex itself is different for men and women. Men are the ones ""doing the fucking"", whereas women are ""getting fucked"". One act is dominant, the other one is submissive. So if you are gay and you do shit like oral or receive-anal - you are literally being the woman in the act, or taking ones place, as you are being submissive in a sexual act."
MurderedByWords,fd52z20,t1_fd51ewb,1578173746.0,"....

My point was that had US not helped Allies in WW2, Germany most likely wouldve won, resulting in Nazi Europe (eventually probably ending up as WW3 US vs Nazi Eurasia).

And regarding ""thousands of civilians"", who cares? Our lives are worthless anyways, we are nothing but a passing moment in the infinite universe. From US point of view, what matters is US and their people (as a whole, not individuals), everyone else is just standing in their way.

Thats the problem with people. They are incapable of thinking without morality clouding their judgement, without even realizing their own morality is based on the opinion of the sheep - the majority's. As times and cultures change, what is considered moral is altered drastically as well. Morality is subjective, therefore useless in an argument and shouldnt be brought up. Everything should be considered based on logic and how it favors the person/people making it. 

So for US, killing thousands makes sense as long as it provides some benefit to the country. Its not like those thousands will be missed a hundred years from now, but US will most likely still stand."

""S11"" doesnt sound that great, its ""just another Galaxy S"", whereas ""S20"" sounds cheap, as others have mentioned.

Yes, I havent, to my knowledge. Ive seen enough of ""good represantation of trans"" in TV, and if I hate the good, then naturally id hate the rest as well. If a dude came up to me and said he is a monkey, insisting I adress him as ""Mr. Monkey"", Id dislike the guy, as Id think he would be insane and shouldnt be alowed to roam the streets free. There is nothing different with trans people, they are literally saying ""I AM X"" when they arent, they are just as fucking retarded as the monkey-guy example.
