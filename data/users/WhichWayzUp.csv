CrazyIdeas,ffftra6,t1_ffesyhk,1579891614.0,"You are right. He absolutely does need therapy.  Also he needs to go to the doctor for so many things (including some obvious symptoms of cancer), but he refuses to ever visit a doctor. He was even suffering in bed last week from shingles (!) crying out in pain (which he never does -- he's not a complainer) but he refused to go to the doctor even after I tenderly encouraged him and then gave him tough love about it and then finally I told him to shut up about it and I refuse to hear any more of his empty pleas for sympathy because he refuses to see a doctor. 

 Even if we bound and gagged him and put him in a straight jacket and forced him to go to the hospital he would still not sign a consent for treatment.  And anyway it would be illegal to bind and gag anyone and take them to the doctor against their will although that is the only way I imagine we could ever get him to a doctor. He is so stupid and stubborn. He is not worth anyone's time being wasted on him at this point.   Except he is really sweet and cuddly and he says all the right words and he is so neat and clean and tidy and well groomed and beautiful . These things about him are what have kept him going all these years but he is about to fall apart.

I've been in-and-out and back-and-forth with him for 5 years. And I know he will not change. I really am pretty much done with him and I've already got 1 foot out the door , often both feet out the door, and into an entirely different lifestyle with more awesome people who deserve my awesomeness."

IAmA,ffe718d,t1_ffdfwxj,1579838408.0,"He did nothing wrong, he's fine and has a good attitude.

Anyway I'm now reminded of a time in 2012 I once had a brush with a PhD medical doctor / yoga teacher who had such a huge ego, I knew her in real life as one of my yoga instructors, and one time she popped up in a facebook conversation with the yoga studio owner who was in Spain, we were joking about that Audrey Hepburn song, ""The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain."" Smart doctor lady chimed in, ""It's spelled P-L-A-N-E. Because in geometry a plane is a level surface, such as a flat lowland. A 'plane.'"" 

Well I happen to know beyond any doubt that the spelling ""plain"" to describe a geologic expanse of lowland, is another one of English language's counter-intuitive anomalies. But doctor lady was curiously rude & obstinate & insistent that it's spelled ""plane,"" 

I just let it go.  I'll give her a pass because I can appreciate how someone who spent a decade in medical school & still has enough time & health to be a yoga teacher, may feel like she's all-knowing & above everyone, and perhaps a bit grumpy for all the time she's had to spend in school, how demanding her Medical career must be, and how stupid most people probably seem to her.
