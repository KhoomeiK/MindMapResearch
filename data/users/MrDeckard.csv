He is on several great podcasts. Behind The Bastards is about the people and things responsible for how fucked the world is. Basically he has a guest on and tells them about the guy who invented fascism, or eugenics, or George Lincoln Rockwell. His most frequent guests are Cody Johnston and Katy Stoll. Cody hosts Some More News on YouTube and Katy writes/produces. They also come from Cracked, and host an ADDITIONAL weekly podcast WITH Robert Evans called Worst Year Ever which is about the people and things trying to make 2020 the worst year ever. Finally he also has a podcast called ""It could happen here"" that's about hypothetical collapses of society. Season 1 is the only one out, but it dives into the possible causes and ramifications of a right wing revolt.

Capitalism has no answer to that. Like you said, if they did, that labor would be making a living wage. But they aren't. So we have to step in and ensure that workers can survive on the proceeds of their labor.

How's this, we don't raise minimum wage. We JUST do the FJG and set the minimum for it at $15 an hour. I wonder how many minimum wage workers will continue to put up with being underpaid when they could go do basic labor and make more money?"

>Government regulation has never been a recipe for success 

Yeah you're right I hate having breathable air and food that doesn't kill me and medicine that contains what it says it does government regulation is evil and gets in the way of freedom 

>You want government to judge where investors can put their money and what profits they can make 

Yes. Absolutely. I want that. They've shown that the only thing they do if we let the accumulate wealth is use it to enrich themselves and tear down safeguards against their power. Forcing them to distribute more of the profits to the actual workers will achieve greater success for everyone as a whole, at the loss of DIZZYING success for only a few. 

>living beyond what most people can imagine. 

Yeah. That's BAD. We shouldn't be living lives of luxury if it requires suffering in such a massive scale. And make no mistake, that's WHY it's happening. Developing nations are great because they provide cheap disposable labor and natural resources that companies bought from the colonial powers who stole the land in the first place. These companies extract all the mineral wealth for pennies on the dollar because there are no regulations on labor in many of these places. Americans are doing this around the world. We could make it illegal, but we don't. Because capitalism doesn't care about anything but maximizing profits and minimizing how much of that profit you pay out to workers and vendors. 

>nothing stops you from starting a business and walking your talk. 

How about the fact that I, like most Americans, have basically no money? I live paycheck to paycheck. Most people do in America. Poor people can't just ""start a business"" and acting like that's an actual ladder out of poverty is just so fucking condescending and shows such ignorance of the realities of poverty. 

This economy has done more for ITS version of prosperity. Which is, to say, it's been really profitable. But it hasn't made life better for average people. It's provided convenience and technology, but it's also stripped away basic labor rights that kept people from being underpaid and exploited. It's destroyed the environment, possibly forever. 

Also ""fuck capitalism, burn it to the ground""? Not super easy to make into a business. Our ideas don't all fit in a ballot box or a bank account.

>it won't provide you or others with a living wage for work that is not worth the wage. If it was, you would he earning the wage already 

So you admit there are jobs that need doing, take forty hours a week to do, but you don't think the human beings doing those jobs should be paid a living wage? Okay, cool. Tell me more about how capitalism definitely doesn't create a permanent underclass by keeping people in poverty through low wages and no room for advancement?"
