I was planning to go to Law School after Engineering and I took some extra time to complete my undergrad which allowed me to take a bunch of the low level law courses.

wholesomememes,ff790zj,t3_erw64a,1579643585.0,"I feel like the only people that worry about this are those that have been on the college track for years without a break. Once you get out in the real world for a while (whether it's a choice, an unexpected event, etc.), you'll realize that nobody gives a shit how long it takes you or anything else. We all try so hard to satisfy other peoples' expectations of us (i.e. family) that we place unnecessary stress on ourselves.

Honestly, taking a little longer to get my undergrad degree was probably the best thing I did. I was very young and immature and totally unprepared for the study requirements of an engineering degree. I came from a small high school that was way too easy for me. Having my undergrad take a little longer allowed me to mature a bit and, honestly, there was a light bulb moment where I just said ""Enough of this lazy shit. I know what's needed study-wise so let's do it"" and, from that point on, I was on the Dean's List with perfect grades until graduation.

We're all different and mature at different times and have different life experiences and events that shape us. The stress of needing to finish a degree on a certain schedule is self-imposed and artificial. There is no deadline."

I often wonder if these people don't understand that behavior like this is just so damn revealing. The resentment and anger he shows is clearly based in jealousy and self-esteem issues but a person like this doesn't typically engage in much introspection.

The temptation is certainly there sometimes to think ""You know what? I do have a lot of money and I can afford his ticket."" So, you go ahead and do it. Problem is that that just leads to more demands and he'll never be nice to you -- at least for more than the 20 minutes after the most recent purchase for him.

Snowboarding is one of those things that kids aren’t good at immediately. And, as you know, that can lead to quick frustration and having a bad day. 

With that much of an age range you might even want to teach them separately if possible at first since it will be considerably easier for the older one(s). Make it fun but challenging with specific (achievable) goals.

In reality, Chuck is/was a fun, simple show that had no need for a contrived, open ended finale that was just hugely disappointing. I've mentioned it before but I'll say again that the mood of my little Chuck viewing group at the time was brutal with multiple people looking at the clock and mentioning that there were a few minutes left and that the series couldn't possibly end that way.

I already have the X2 and, at the time, the Rampage seemed like a pretty cheap way to get a belt drive that I could potentially use with pneumatics. But, even at $700, it just didn’t make sense to keep my order so I cancelled it. 

I think $700 for this board is a pretty decent deal (keeping in mind the compromises you mentioned) but for me, with the X2 already sitting here, it just seems like money better served going towards something a little different.

However, many panhandlers in larger urban areas are actually only pretending to be homeless. They are ""fake panhandlers"" that aren't really needy but find it easier to stand around outside shopping centers and freeway off ramps asking for handouts than to be productive members of society. It's nearly impossible to tell these folks from the truly needy.

So, what do you do -- how do you tell the fake from real panhandlers? You don't. You take any and all handouts that you were going to give to these folks and give them to organizations that help the homeless in the right ways: Habitat for Humanity, United Way, Feeding America, and many others. If people stop giving money to panhandlers and redirect it to the organizations that can really help them the opportunity for fake panhandlers goes away and they might actually be forced to get a job.

lastimages,fcj9ga8,t1_fcj3jsr,1577680584.0,"How horrible. He was probably feeling perfectly healthy, had some stomach issues and was then given a diagnosis like that. He went from thinking he was fine to a terminal diagnosis in weeks. And, it sounds like he passed away not too long after diagnosis. Awful. Awful. Sorry for your loss. Remember the good times and remind you kids."
ElectricSkateboarding,fcgm93y,t1_fcgkirc,1577641672.0,I'm an idiot. Of course you'd use the ones from the kit. Disregard my moment of stupidity.
ElectricSkateboarding,fcghom2,t1_fcgbawi,1577640160.0,"One more question. Did you use the existing OB belts for the Cloudwheels or the 6"" AT wheels? That is, what was on your OB when you switched over to the Evolve?"
ElectricSkateboarding,fcgbvod,t1_fcgbawi,1577638397.0,I think I might do the same because they look like they still have plenty of grip.
ElectricSkateboarding,fcfzooq,t1_fcftcqu,1577635163.0,"I'm assuming you got the Evolve AT 7"" w/ knobby AT wheels vs. their AT street?"

Nowhere in my comment did I suggest that all people are assholes or that playing music on a hike is always inappropriate. Obviously, there are some situations where playing music is just fine. It's just common sense but here you go: if you're on a heavily trafficked trail have some respect for others and turn the music down or off.

And, regarding your other comments: Have you ever confronted folks blasting music in these situations -- typically in groups of 5+? My guess is that you haven't otherwise you would never suggest that they would quickly turn their speaker off with a ""gentle prod"". (This almost has to be a joke that you suggest they would.)

I have tried various approaches in these situations and it's usually met in one of two ways: turning the volume down slightly when you're in the immediate vicinity (while making jokes about your group in low voices to their friends) and then blasting it even louder once you are past (but not so far past that you can't hear them turn it up), or, because they're in the comfort of a group, they give some of the reasoning we've seen elsewhere in these comments: this is a public space, you have to share it, chill dude, etc.

Respect for others. It's not that hard."
ElectricSkateboarding,fcfodyw,t1_fcfhu7h,1577632235.0,"Man, you've got me wanting to go this route. Is there anything else I need to know to get the Evolve 7"" AT kit working with the OB AT?"

Honestly, he just needs a punch in the face which life will assuredly deliver to him eventually.  He doesn't realize it now but he'll be much better off if that correction is delivered sooner than later. There are people to whom the correction is never delivered (Jake Paul, etc.) and it generally does not work out well for those folks in the long term."
ParkRangers,fcb0dt9,t1_fcazqta,1577580183.0,"Well, I'm not in that position any more but that would definitely have been a valuable tool to have. We didn't have that ability and I suspect most of the violators knew that."
hiking,fcavssx,t1_fcat5vx,1577577595.0,"Absolutely there are considerate folks like yourself. But, I suspect that if we were to take the entire set of people listening to bluetooth speakers during hikes we would find that you are the exception rather than the rule.

Also anecdotal is my own experience that virtually everyone I've come across listening to bluetooth speakers during hikes is blasting their music and doesn't care about anybody else. And, unlike most of the internet, I'm not just saying that to exaggerate the reality -- literally every person I've come across with bluetooth speakers has been the inconsiderate type.

**Edit**: Ooh. It could be argued that I've only taken note of people with bluetooth speakers that have left their speakers blasting. Considerate people like yourself have perhaps turned down the sound such that I never acknowledged them as listening to bluetooth speakers. Perhaps my data is skewed? Nah. Really doubt it because people aren't generally able to detect other hikers and turn down their sound before I could hear the music from their speakers."
ElectricSkateboarding,fcargl1,t1_fcaqz7q,1577575167.0,Yep. And the fact that you got a great deal won't matter if the board doesn't measure up. I've seen nothing so far to indicate that it will meet (or exceed) my needs.
ElectricSkateboarding,fcaqj7v,t1_fcapsq5,1577574598.0,"Yeah, I hated to do it but I just haven't seen enough positive comments from folks to warrant keeping the order. There are so many others options. The price was good but a price is only good if the product is good too and I just wasn't feeling it."
hiking,fcaordx,t1_fcaobrw,1577573538.0,"Man, that’s so much worse if true. Thinking that others would be impressed by your music selection while forcing them to hear it blasted on a hiking trail means they’re just unbelievably stupid."
hiking,fcaokim,t1_fcao1kf,1577573418.0,"Assuming that they are oblivious helps me to think better of them and perhaps, as you suggest, that is incorrect. I hope you’re wrong but I suspect you may be right."
ElectricSkateboarding,fcao379,t1_fcalm2i,1577573120.0,I just went to View Order and used the Contact Us link to request a cancellation. I haven’t seen the credit show up on my account yet but they were very nice about it and I expect they will follow through.
hiking,fcajgbx,t3_egwjag,1577570353.0,"I know we're all different but I'm amazed at the people that do this without feeling self-conscious or that they're imposing on others. But I've come across a few people doing this and, without fail, they don't give a shit about anyone around them and I wouldn't be surprised to learn that they never considered the effect of their music on others. It's just kind of amazing. I would be embarrassed and apologetic if I imposed my music on others but I really don't think it crosses their mind. They exist in a narcissistic bubble and honestly need to be told that nobody wants to hear their crap music."
ParkRangers,fcagnuq,t3_egvz6k,1577568907.0,"It is very hard sometimes to not allow experiences similar to this to affect my opinion of the average person. I've run people off from non-permitted campsites only to find them packing up to leave in the morning from the very same site that they must have returned to after our last pass of the night. I've walked up to them and talked to them and they're kind of smirking and laughing about it. In no way are they apologetic. They have no intention of obeying the rules nor do they think those rules should apply to them.

We inform visitors of the rules and, indeed, Permit Required signs are posted and, yet, people seem to do whatever they want anyway. It's very frustrating and difficult to prevent my opinion of the average person from being affected. Not everyone is like this but many of these people seem unbelievably selfish and they don't seem to care one bit about the environment or anyone else."
ElectricSkateboarding,fc9yni5,t3_egumrn,1577560173.0,"That's awesome news. I'm really surprised as I expected a 25% hit on range with the pneumatic tires. As soon as my Miles order is refunded, this is probably the direction I'll go.

Are you enjoying the ride?"
ElectricSkateboarding,fc9wo41,t1_fc7np4l,1577559302.0,"Thanks for the comments. I've cancelled my Rampage order. Even at such a good price, it makes little sense to keep it. I can use that money towards a different board in the spring. I really like my X2 -- wish for a little more top speed but overall it's a great board."
