GenderCritical,ffi9u3r,t1_ffi9pkq,1579968765.0,"You might have just nailed it. It's easy to be 'woke' until it starts affecting you personally.

Edit: to further your point, they all went very quiet when I pointed out the 'cotton ceiling' phenomenon in the trans community, even though they were just unknowingly commenting on exactly that."
GenderCynicalCritical,ff5f5x1,t3_erf5fi,1579590209.0,They're right. Raping people is nowhere near as bad as misgendering. I hope those brave rapists are reporting those TERFS to the police.
bipolar,ff29mkk,t3_er8are,1579497903.0,"I've been on Lamictal for about 18 months and this past week have been getting horrible nausea. I assumed it was because I was Celiac except I haven't actually changed my diet recently. Maybe it's the Lamictal.

I've been taking ginger tablets for it. They take away the nausea but still leave me feeling like I couldn't eat."

Celiac,feeycza,t1_fedq4kr,1579043916.0,I try not to mix my meds with weed but it might not be too terrible in the short term. Might as well see what happens lol
Celiac,feeyb6d,t1_fedo9v2,1579043884.0,I can't believe I hadn't considered ginger! Thanks :)
bipolar,fe1ufyj,t1_fe0vt70,1578830997.0,I know! I thought maybe I was being sensitive at the time but it was really insulting.
bipolar,fdzv3qc,t3_encbw8,1578796505.0,"A friend of mine once told me she thought she was bipolar. When I asked why she said ""because sometimes I feel happy and sometimes I feel sad."" We lost touch."
bipolar,fdmlzpf,t3_em4rui,1578555028.0,Reminds me of when I was put on antidepressants and was amazed at how well they worked. Ended up in the hospital lol
