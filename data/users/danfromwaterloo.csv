That's the system.  You don't see billionaire doctors, lawyers, engineers, or teachers.  Billionaires are all entrepreneurs.  People who own big stakes in monolithic businesses.  The American Way is actually just to start a company and profit on the backs of people working for you.  Billionaires just found a way to make that more efficient for themselves.

We live and work in a system.  The system has defined rules that we've all set up.  Billionaires are representatives of people who have learned how to best succeed in the system.  They're the symptom, not the problem.

Change the system. Close loopholes.  Create new tax tiers for UHNW individuals.  They'll survive just fine.  But they're not the problem here.  Instead of pandering to the masses of how this is unfair, AOC needs to focus on changing the legislation.  It's literally her job to fight for these things."
politics,ffd3o55,t1_ffd14ad,1579812794.0,"> If you viewed it as Trump investigating perceived corruption that entangled a potential future President would that change your opinion at all? Curious how motive plays in to people's opinion of the situation.

A) WILDLY convenient. Trump doesn't care about corruption.  If he did, don't you think he'd be investigating everyone - not just his likely opponent in 2020? 

> More interested in the first point but I feel like it should be pointed out that we have separation of powers between 3 branches of government and the judicial would be the place to settle this dispute as far as I can tell.

I don't think separation of powers means what you think it means in this context.  Congress has oversight over the Executive Branch, and has been given subpoena powers that it requires in order to do investigations and keep the Executive Branch in check.  Trump has blocked every subpoena he can - to prevent Congress from doing it's job.

The Judicial Branch IS the place to determine this - agreed - but the timeline to have this work its way through the courts would take over a year.  Given that represents at least a quarter of a Presidential term, it effectively kills any ability for Congress to do what the Constitution has empowered it to do."
politics,ffcoxat,t1_ffchrfm,1579804088.0,"....which is fucking dumb as hell.

Trump is the most polarizing figure in American politics ever.  People already know that they're either voting for or against him already.  I haven't heard of one single voter who said ""I was going to vote for him, and after hearing everything about Ukraine, I can't vote for him.""

No - people are either showing up at his rallies with MAGA hats or they're foaming at the mouth to impeach.  There's nobody in the middle anymore."
politics,ffcopa8,t1_ffcn97t,1579803957.0,"I don't agree.  

The President has been using his political office for personal gain - in a plethora of ways, really, but *specifically*, using his power to get foreign governments to dig up dirt on his political rivals.  This act alone is worthy of removal of office - we would expect the same of ANY politician, not just the President.  

Imagine if the Mayor of your city held up construction on a new development in your area on the caveat that the developers announce that his rival attempted to bribe them.  Or that a Senator held up a major defense contract on the proviso that Lockheed contributed a major amount of money to his re-election campaign.   

You simply cannot use your office to benefit your campaign to get re-elected.  It's tantamount to bribery (and may very well BE bribery, IANAL).  

I ABSOLUTELY agree that the House was salivating over the prospects of Trump doing ANYTHING to warrant a proper impeachment.  It shows his level of stupidity that he actually GAVE them something worthy of it.

And, regardless of the underlying crime, it is an absolute fact that he is obstructing Congress, which is an abuse of power, and is worthy of impeachment in and of itself."

politics,ffcg4lj,t3_ess4mk,1579798728.0,"There are two primary drivers to companies in America: money, and people.  

If money should be the driver, the free market should control it.

If people should be the driver, the government should control it.

There really cannot be a sustained alternative.  Inevitably, all businesses will focus on making money, to the detriment of everything else.  Governments will focus on losing money, being wildly inefficient, and generally suck at everything - but at least they're answerable to the people (in theory).  

We already believe in these principles.  It's why police are public servants.  It's why judges are public servants.  It's why the military is a branch of the government.  Same with schools.  When controlled by money, protection, justice, defense, education, and a whole host of other, principled, basic services would be a pay-to-play world.  We're already seeing how justice skews to the rich, and how education does likewise.  We all see the horror of healthcare for those who can afford it.

I'm not advocating socialist or communist propaganda.  The free market is one of the core beliefs of our society, and rightly so.  It's been the single biggest driver for productivity in history.  But, our government has to ensure that every American has the basic tools for live, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  That means, safety, justice, defense, education, and yes, basic healthcare.   For every single person.  Always."

If this were a normal, non-political impeachment, quite the contrary.  Because this is already a forgone conclusion, it's actually wasting everybody's time.  Perhaps the fact that this is the case is the bigger crime."
politics,ffcesfr,t3_ess4zz,1579797911.0,"The thing perhaps I'm missing:

One of the charges is Obstruction of Congress.  Trump is openly stonewalling both the House and the Senate by refusing to comply with subpoenas.  Doesn't this count as evidence to the charge?

The analogy would be a citizen refusing to comply with providing evidence to a lawful court order.  Isn't that lack of cooperation evidence to the crime itself?

If so, doesn't that make the underlying crime moot at this point?  

""We have evidence the President committed a crime, but because he's not cooperating with our investigation, he is guilty of obstruction, which in and of itself, is a crime, and one worthy of impeachment."""

To me, there's a crazy amount of ""shadow money"" that is being poured into the economy.  Just check out trading volumes from before the election and after it.
