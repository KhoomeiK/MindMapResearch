Developers never have the ability to actually figure characters out at a level that stands up to the amount of collective experience a playerbase ends up gaining, so there isn't necessarily even an ability to create characters around archetypes.

However, there are essentially four universal basic types of characters you'll see in games, that come from taking the easy way to create clear distinctions between characters.

Developers and players at some point identify the baseline all arounder, a [Jack of All Stats]( https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats). From this, it's easiest to distinguish a character that sacrifices either offence or defence for the other, to start leaning toward [Glass Cannon](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon) or [Stone Wall](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall). Possibly overlapping with the previous two, or going a completely different direction, are characters overdriven toward something, to reach [Crippling Overspecialization](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization).

gaming,fdu9795,t1_fdt7uu7,1578729764.0,"Anime had a proper foothold in the West at least 10 years before that.

Anime aimed at young children is what came first. Anime aimed at younger audiences was a thing in Europe since the early 70s, with something like Maya the Honey Bee dubbed in multiple European languages. Wider European releases were very inconsistent, likely due to the complexity of dubbing to multiple languages. The most drastic example I know of inconsistent European releases, is [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://i.imgur.com/ZUsETJx.png), with one very early release in Italy, and failing to spread elsewhere for 14 years.

The US has had anime dubbed for young audiences, made by companies like Saban Productions since the 80s. As a quick sidenote, in addition to being a North American pioneer in co-producing or dubbing anime, Saban is also one of the companies responsible for the modern French animation industry. A lot of the animated shows for young children these days come from France.

And from Saban, it's easy to hop over to Harmony Gold and Streamline, who actually did more than just dub anime for 5 year olds.

Harmony Gold USA is a weird company, with a habit of making large structural edits to some of the things they bring over. They brought over mecha and magical girl anime. They did their weird thing with Robotech in 1985, where they licensed multiple mecha anime, and patched those together to create a single franchise. Then they brought over magical girl anime with Magical Princess Gigi in 1986, 5 years before Sailor Moon was even getting serialized as a manga. Harmony Gold was also the first to try bringing over their edit of the original Dragon Ball, but they cancelled after miserable test viewings, without ever actually releasing it.

Then there's Streamline. Started in late 1988 by people who had worked at Harmony Gold. They brought in some experts on animation, and the company was dedicated to bringing over anime from the get go. So, they start off by bringing Akira, and 3 Hayao Miyazaki movies to Western audiences, in just their first year. In the early 90s they bring over Macross, Fist of the North Star, Lupin the Third, more Ghibli, and some other stuff.

The 80s really showed media companies that there was a market for all of this, and I want to give special mention to Galaxy Rangers in 1985, just because they had a cool [theme song](https://youtu.be/3Sso3h0xMJA) and it reminds me of Interstella 5555. Gaylord Entertainment's The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers is an interesting case, because it's a fairly early example of much closer collaboration. It was a Western production, with animation contracted to Tokyo Movie Shinsha. TMS later did animation for other productions, like Animaniacs and Duck Tales.

I have plenty more I could talk about in the lead up to 1997, with anime releases, production companies, and notable events like the 1996 deal where Disney started distributing Ghibli works, or going over weird one offs like Astro Boy's original run and reruns on US networks for about 10 years from 1963. In the end, I don't see a point in pushing on, as I'm sure someone somewhere has already done a much better job at going over this."

Basically, most of the Jews who migrated into Europe, were Ashkenazi Jews. A couple hundred years back, historians and religious scholars started considering that the Ashkenazi originated primarily or in some major amount from Khazar converts. This wasn't all too controversial at first, so let's just skip to when it started to matter.

The Khazars were considered to be ethnically fairly diverse, or inbetween ethnic groups. In the earlier 20th century ethnic views, they were seen as an impure race. Later on, there were more ideological arguments about different religious groups making claims of being descendents of Israelites, or who's ancestors were involved in killing Jesus, and other non-sense about claiming glory or laying blame for events 100 generations back.

What makes it dumb, is that modern anthropology knows it's false, now that we have tools like DNA testing to investigate ancestry. Multiple studies have noticed a gene or two that could be a link, but mostly at the level of possibly a few percent or a few family lines.

Edit: So, one of my goals for this year is not worrying about meaningless details that ultimately won't affect anything, but I wrote unpure instead of impure, and it's been bugging me for 6 hours."

Putting all of this together, your reasoning for why we need to tell China to pay short term to act more responsibly, is because of a problem the rest of the world is causing by refusing to pay short term to act more responsibly.

That actually kind of sums up why countries aren't telling off China. It's because everyone else is instigating the problem, and there a few issues making it hard to go tell China, how they need to be better than us and take charge of pushing everyone else to be more environmentally responsible.

When it comes to playing against other people, I don't even care about whether I win or lose, but rather the general quality of a game. I tend to even enjoy playing against ""cheap"" tactics, as long as they don't turn gameplay stale, because knowing that I'm playing a fair game against someone doing everything they can to win, means that I'm not being handed a win due to ignorance or arrogance."
Unexpected,fc5bcsx,t1_fc3p2ek,1577452042.0,"Literally anyone in my extended family would've bought that if a kid asked for it. I actually got Mao's Red Book and Mein Kampf when I was maybe 8.

My father's side of the family were essentially right wing terrorists getting jailed for illegal arms caches just a few generations back. The extremism actually died down with reading and education, going from farmers to having engineers, historians, economists, and political scientists in the next two generations. Extreme political, philosophical, and religious texts are pretty much encouraged on that side of the family.

My mother's side comes from a community with similar militant ideas and family history, and once again ended up moving to mild mannered priests, teachers, and engineers. My maternal grandparents grew up in a community with a very onesided view of history, and eventually broke out of that by reading authors who weren't seen as acceptable. That side of the family is deeply religious, and not necessarily openminded on all fronts, but still encouraging of reading both sides of everything."
CrazyIdeas,fc56xc5,t3_eg5m3s,1577446337.0,"I really like the idea of this as an option, but more so to play without it, and have the other game mode designed to be played without any relevant freebies. Being punished for doing terrible can be frustrating, but I never find it nearly as bad as getting rewarded or winning when I did bad.

I personally hate stuff like roguelite progression, where every time I die I just feel like I've failed, and won't ever succeed at that level again. Most games do offer resetting progress, but even those suffer from being designed for that specific power curve, and end up being a good challenge somewhere mid way, while not necessarily letting you stay in the sweet spot you want."
facepalm,fc47j2s,t1_fc3ws7d,1577408724.0,"Yes, and even then we'd still only have a chance of convincing individual people physically brought up there. Most of them are entrenched and alienated by their beliefs, similar to creationists, anti-vaxxers, and other people deeply invested in pseudo-scientific nonsense, and just end up cobbling together the next model to be disproven.

We could essentially be doing similar stuff already, with circumnavigations of Antarctica or disproving their solar models with extremely high altitude flights. It's just ridiculously inefficient, and doesn't actually create any value in return. Just disproving a single belief that comes from a lack of understanding or misunderstanding a plethora of basic information, doesn't actually increase the competence of a person."
truegaming,fbyymvf,t1_fbxoyxr,1577229922.0,"It's almost as if developers are utterly incompetent at opening a game. Despite all the praise NieR: Automata gets, it's still the only game I've ever refunded on Steam, all because of how much it managed to do wrong in the first 15 minutes.

Awful dialog, nonsensical NPC behavior, pointless few second cutscenes taking control from you repeatedly, 30 seconds of having limited control in an autoscroller where literally nothing happens, dreadful early gameplay sequences not actually relevant to the rest of the game, some of the blandest music in the game, and the first time you actually see scenery in the game, it's the same two ruined buildings copypasted dozens of times in the middle of the sea. On top of all that, I had the misfortuned of play the newly released PC port, with it's miserable performance, visuals, and despite advertising keyboard support, early gameplay having default keys mapped for two hands on the keyboard and an attack that couldn't be rebound on the right mouse button."
