She was born via C-section at 37 weeks +5 and placed immediately on ECMO due to scoring 1.5 Apgar. She had surgery to repair the very next day, which involved placing a goretex patch in her diaphragm and pushing her liver, gallbladder, and part of her intestines back into place. She only has 20% diaphragm so the patch is making up the other 80%.

The incision was intentionally left partially separated and a wound vac placed on it, with a chest tube also placed for drainage. Her right lung is only about 10% the size it should be.

The doctor has said the incision looks phenomenal (currently 11 days post op) and she's been doing really well otherwise.
