I have a few suggestions. 

Try saying hi to folks. Look them in the eye when you do and smile. You will be amazed how good this makes you feel. 

Get a part time job or volunteer somewhere. Why? Because having a common purpose or interest virtually forces you to interact with others in that environment, and is a great way of making acquaintances and friends. 

Finally, and this is the hardest one to master: Get. Out. Side. Get off the computer/phone. Go out into the world. You can have 100 facebook friends and still feel like the loneliest person in the world. 

Good luck, hope one or two of these help."
