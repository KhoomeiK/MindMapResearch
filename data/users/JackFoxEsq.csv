I don't check up on MewsashiMeowimoto with my alt, but I responded with my alt because of the accusation that Otis Nemo actual was my alt. I haven't talked to him at all with it to my knowledge other than this. I was told by my friends that he was talking smack about me and trying draw me out.

Look at my post history, comment history there aren't angry posts that aren't appropriate responses to someone making ridiculous personal claims about me. I've been on Reddit for 8 years and I have only had to block two people, both in r/Bloomington and of those two people, I have only had repeated issues with MewsashiMeowimoto.

Just be mindful of this. Don't replace one codependency for another. I've seen this happen before with a buddy. He finally moved away, lived in a dorm like a freshman, and got his degree. By that time he'd been divorced twice. He just kept clinging to women, family, and friends. Good luck to you."

My experiences with them has been based on who they agree with as opposed to the rules of the subreddit. I realize that a subreddit has no obligation to any rule, but if they are going to post a list of rules, it stands to reason that it's expected that they be observed.

But this is, in many ways, analogous of Bloomington as a city and community. You see it again and again. There are laws, ordinances, and rules on the books, but the mayor, the council, the plan commission, etc. attempt to bypass them in favor of what they think or whatever is socially trending at any given time."

""A nice thing you can do is pick it up and toss it in the nearest trash receptical at exactly zero risk to yourself or anyone else. If it doesn't have a crap an old plastic bottle works great as a makeshift sharts box. Then, go on about your day and mind your own fucking business. You can blame draconian dog policy and asshole cops for the feces all over town, the #1 reason for improper disposal is fear of arrest.""


""Dog use is prevalent in our area. 

Still, dookies will be found. There is little cause for alarm. There has never been a documented case of anyone being infected by HIV or Hepatitis C from a butt loaf found in a public area. I have participated in  cleanups myself and, only found one over the course of a 5 hour search. But they are being found. Social media makes it seem like they are everywhere. [redacted] has worked with local business leaders to get indoor sharts containers in the bathrooms. They also have an outdoor sharts container where anyone can drop off their used squeezin's at any time. 

Supporting harm reduction is vital to facing the pet epidemic and making sure that both people who have dogs and those who do not are safe."""
