plantclinic,ffcr9c3,t3_esuj9z,1579805610.0,"How I care for my 4 pathos plants:

&#x200B;

1. Completely ignore it
2. When I notice the leaves curling, I put the pots in a shallow pan and soak until water comes out the bottom. Let them sit for an hour. Take them out of the standing water, and put them on a towel so they won't drip. After about 20 minutes, I hang them back up.
3. Repeat step 1

Twice a year (once when I bring them in off my porch in the fall, and once before I put them out on the porch in spring) I throw them in the shower for their soaking to clean them off."

Then he came up, while i still had a line, and stuck the receipt in my face and said ""you charged me $8.34...the shelf tag says $8.32"". I said, ""I'm sorry, I'll have to change the sign, the price in the register is the correct price"", thinking , no way this guy is going to bust my balls over 2 cents. He proceeded to throw a fit about how we were ripping customers off, blah, blah, blah. All while I'm trying to help all the customers in line.

puppy101,fef9aiu,t3_eosq53,1579051215.0,"I grew up with an ""outside dog"", meaning he was outside 24/7. He slept in the garage if it was going to be extremely cold. He had an insulated dog house with weather flaps and everything. He was my grandfather's dog, technically, and my grandfather was a very experienced dog trainer and owner. Oddly enough, the dog never had any health problems, was happy as a clam, and died at 15 years old when he escaped the yard and was hit by a car. So....this is a very normal way to keep a dog for some people.

Not for me, though.

7 months is definitely way too young to be left outside unattended for any real length of time. My 8 month old pit mix goes out alone to potty and maybe run a couple laps around the yard while he's at it, but I hover by the back door. He usually wants to come in after 10 minutes. MAYBE, when he's a few years old, MAYBE he'll prefer some hours outside on a nice day rather than his crate, but NOT a whole day.  Only after he's way beyond the hyper, chew everything, dig holes and eat random crap stage. My sister lives in the woods and has a 7 year old lab that spends most of the day outside, but the dog has the freedom to come in whenever she wants, and she never wanders far. The crate is absolutely the safest place for your dog when you're not home. You know your dog best. If and when the day comes that the dog wants to, and can be trusted to stay outside for long periods of time, you'll know. Families are such a pain in the butt, lol."

AskReddit,fdnznh9,t3_em2vfz,1578596098.0,"We always had to have shoes on in the house. We got yelled at if we were caught walking around barefoot. My family owned a bait and tackle shop that was attached to the house, and I guess my father was afraid there may be stray fishhooks on the floor? When I got older, I realized that it is much more normal to take shoes OFF in the house, lol. I still get annoyed when I have to take my shoes off at someone else's house. I remove my ""street shoes"" at home, but I have ""house sneakers""  or slippers I change into."

gardening,fdlcy2t,t1_fdkfutj,1578521358.0,I just rip them out as they sprout so they never flower and go to seed. I have too many things planted along the fence to burn or poison them.
gardening,fdlcpb3,t1_fdkrjyu,1578521211.0,The problem is I have azaleas and hydrangeas planted along the fence and the morning glories strangle them.

I ended up throwing a handfull of kibble in there instead (a higher value ""treat""). So far it's worked. I'm wondering if he's going to continue to raise the stakes on me though."
