I lucked into a job for Kinko's where I got really excellent customer service training that I desperately needed (and later became a customer service instructor). That made me valuable in the company and more valuable to the competition. I worked for two other quick print companies after Kinko's, in management. Then I moved into sales in an unrelated industry. My customer service experience helped me understand and meet customer needs. I had top sales 80% of the time.

Then I opened my first business with 3 other partners. My title was Creative Director and one partner focused only on sales. Again, I had top sales most of the time and 98% of my customers returned for additional work. This business provided IT services so as I backed up the other partners, I learned a lot about IT. 

I got out of that partnership and started my own marketing consultancy until I was recruited by a wholesale company to be their Marketing Director. I loved everything about that job except my boss who was shady so I quit and started an IT/Marketing Consultancy which I did for about 10 years. The money was good but I was traveling a lot and missing my kid growing up so I shut that down and got a job for the local County in Data Management.

Everything after construction required people skills. I got promoted several times through this process, including at places who had never promoted anyone before. They appreciated my work because I did a good job and made their lives easier. My boss was my customer."

For exercise I prefer running but I'm getting old and my knees are warning me to knock that off. I also do bodyweight workouts (I follow along to Mark Lauren's YAYOB program) and sometimes kettlebell swings (S&S). These are full body workouts, generally done in less than an hour, no monthly contracts, very small cash outlay to get started, and they build endurance which gives me more energy throughout the day which helps with avoiding negativity. 

For gratitude, I make everyone list at least two things they are grateful for during evening prayers when I put my kid to sleep.

Building wins starts small: I got out of bed. I brushed my teeth. I took a shower. I got dressed. I got to work. On time! Etc.

If for example you sold a work for $100 on ebay, you'll never be able to sell work at premiums in the future.

Complete falsehood. That doesn't even make sense. Galleries will sell work that sells. Artists who are not established don't have the same limitations as established artists.

Here's what you want to think about: once you set your prices they can go up but never down. Anyone who invested in your full price work will feel ripped off. Your reputation is your brand.

Artists who raise prices too fast or on a wave get stuck. They can't lower their prices because that will kill their brand. They can't sell the work they have at the inflated rate.

Go slow. Earn and justify each raise. If sales slow then keep your rates flat."

Is it art? Sure. Is it cheap? Sure. 

It's been done to death and appeals to the lowest common denominator instead of elevating the viewer. To me that's boring where someone like [Tori](https://instagram.com/torianne00?igshid=nuqz2vl2ylkd) or [Cindy](https://instagram.com/cindypressart?igshid=zoqkwuqcgqsr) have illustrative styles and innovate, making the tried and true fresh and new.

If you are referring to anime style pinup art, it's not just a crowded theme but a space full of hacks. Almost daily I see a thread from someone angry that someone (a teacher, parent, etc) won't accept their anime as their true self-expression and instead insists they strive for realism. But realism is hard and a lot of these complaints are from people too lazy to do the work. They're also trying to make a case that the person literally put on this planet to educate them isn't redirecting their shortcut.

If you look at Picasso, there were definitely national and international movements that he participated in. He stole a lot of his best ideas. But he also made them his own, often by mashing several things together to make something fresh: the abstraction of Matisse, the emotionalism of Cezanne, and his own color palette might give you something like [this](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/11/arts/11INSIDERART2/11INSIDERART2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale). Everyone was doing cubism, but this was his take on the theme instead of a copy that could have been produced by any animator or imitator.

Now Art isn't obligated to be fresh, new, unique, etc. But it's more interesting when it is and if you want to get past obscurity then you need to do something different. If you get past obscurity you'll get criticism no matter what you do.

If you want the acceptance that you crave, you have to break through obscurity. To break through obscurity will attract criticism. If you can't handle criticism, quit. Or keep your art to yourself as a hobby.

Criticism is an essential aspect of the art process. It will help you grow. If someone else's opinion about what is art upsets you so much that you want to quit, then I think you should quit. The greatest artists redefined art and received heavy criticism as a result. Ridicule, even. They embraced it.

You can use criticism or be defeated by it. It's your choice which will happen.

AskMen,fecp6r1,t1_fecatb5,1578979722.0,"Yeah, some reminders are good depending on personal preferences, context, communication styles, etc. I just don't like when my wife tries to ""mother"" me and I feel that it's not fair for me to put her in that position. Some guys appreciate that kind of attention in a way I don't. It's cool: different strokes and all that."
redditgetsdrawn,fecbggu,t1_feb4qwn,1578970137.0,Good job. That was a creative solution. I had a similar problem with a painting last night and all I could do was cover it up and start again.
AskMen,fec923u,t1_febdfsv,1578968802.0,"Encouragement is good, reminders might not be. YMMV"
AskReddit,fec70iy,t1_feau05u,1578967736.0,"People shouldn't fear assault even if they've behaved questionably. I mean, you're being practical but disclosure shouldn't be a ""by the way..."" thing. And not just for trans but other big deals like have disease, have kids, don't ever want kids, etc."
AskReddit,fear4qn,t3_eo3q9l,1578951479.0,I'll have to get a new job but I'll probably get some new phone numbers on my way out.
ArtCrit,feaqxan,t1_feaddoj,1578951414.0,"I have one but it slowed the drying time too much. I've tried finding a good tutorial but they're all kinda too specific or too vague so if you have a good one too point me to, I'd appreciate it!

Something else that I was thinking about is simplifying the palette to maybe 4 flesh colors, mix them all at once and then see how fast I can get them on the canvas. That might be a terrible idea but I think I'm going for it on the next one!"
ArtCrit,fe9y7ce,t1_fe9srdz,1578942521.0,"Yeah, the eyes were killing me. I should have watched for the highlight creeping up, thank you."
TrueChristian,fe9le19,t1_fe6a3ce,1578939070.0,"Lack of evidence is not evidence. The Bible does not say that Jesus healed every person who came to him.

Full stop.

You're adding your opinion with zero data to back it up. Jesus is plenty miraculous without inserting our own narratives."
NetflixBestOf,fe6n7m6,t1_fe59sbi,1578896745.0,"I kinda agree but not for someone new to the genre. Stallone's Judge Dredd is good for people who enjoyed Demolition Man, but the 2012 Dredd is very different."
