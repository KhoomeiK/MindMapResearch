Making fouls a ""resource"" that you ""spend"" to gain an advantage goes against the entire point of having actions you don't want in the game and penalizing people for doing them, and it turns the last few minutes of a close game into an excruciating free-throw-shooting contest rather than a legitimate sporting event.

Went down to Iowa to do an outdoor show the start/finish line of... I think it's a bike race? Anyhoo, set day, we had some weather predicted so we double-tarped FOH, no side walls on the tent but we figured the tarps should work well enough. Went back to the hotel, called it a night.

Around 1am my boss rings my phone, he's looking at the weather and wants to get eyeballs on our rig. So I get dressed and hop in the truck with him to go down and check.

First thing we notice is that the wind has blown the spotlights out of the spot tower, mere feet from FOH. Second thing we notice is that the tarps have blown off the dimmers and it's raining directly into them. Audio gear all looks fine, so we re-tarp the dimmers (too little too late?), and make a phone call to the lighting guys letting them know about the situation.

In the morning I discover that water has somehow gotten through two tarps and into my audio console. I open it up to let it bake for a couple hours, and when it's time to sound check my opener I close it back up and pray. One dead channel but otherwise fine. Woot! Lighting had to acquire two replacement spotlights by showtime, but somehow the dimmers were fine. I couldn't believe it."
livesound,ff98suc,t3_es9p31,1579707484.0,"In a town about an hour south of me, there's an outdoor amphitheatre. A local production company puts a roof over the stage and supplies PA for shows in the summer.

Until one day, there was an intense storm that blew the roof over (luckily everyone had taken shelter away from it and nobody was hurt).

This story is not about that.

This story is about two weeks later, when the production company I worked for was hired to supply the roof and production for the rest of the summer.

So we were putting on a little festival out there, around the middle of the show we started getting rain, called off the show, and started working on battening everything down.

Over the next hour, the weather got hellish. 40 mph winds, rain that felt like it was landing punches on you. The stagehands, traumatized from the events of two weeks prior, were lamenting their bad fortune. Our roof was rated up to 70mph so we weren't worried about any structural issues but you try explaining that to folks who just had a roof almost land on them two weeks ago.

Anyway, I got FOH pretty well buttoned down, I went to the stage to see if they needed anything, they were struggling keeping rain out of the backline but told me to go keep FOH dry. Works for me. The walls of my FOH tent were whipping around and the ropes tying it down to the ballast were visibly straining but the tent did its job.

Touring crew was nowhere to be seen during this debacle, they were all cowering on the bus. After the rain subsided their FOH came off the bus and asked me about the status of his gorgeous vintage analog rig that would have probably been impossible to replace. He seemed prepared to hear the worst. I happily let him know that it was dry as a bone under a tarp inside a tent. I didn't tell him that he could've put some of his own effort into saving it if he really cared about it that much.

Next day we un-tarped the rig and did day 3 of the festival like nothing had happened."

The big thing is that your routing is a hell of a lot more complex in broadcast world than anywhere else. You need to be methodical and organized to manage all of it.

The other thing is that you have to develop the ear for being able to listen to and comprehend cues from your producer and director, while also making your show sound good. Doesn't matter how good your mix sounds when you miss a tape roll because you were too busy listening to the mix to hear your director's cue. But you're also gonna get yelled at if your announcers are buried under the FX."
livesound,fdkrm6v,t1_fdk5ptr,1578509705.0,">For example when the video changes from one feed to another, are you  making the change for the audio to switch simultaneously, or how is that  managed?

Most of the time, in sports, you're doing everything with fingers on faders and listening to the director and producer call the show. There are a couple opportunities to let technology do the work for you though.

So, video switchers have signals that they output called ""tally"" which indicate which sources of video are live. Tally from the switcher is hooked into the cameras to light up a red light letting the camera operator know their camera is live, it's hooked into video walls to turn sources red in the monitor wall when those sources are live... and it can also be sent to the audio console and used to trigger macros.

It's totally possible to build your show so that sources of audio are automatically made hot in response to certain sources of video getting tallied. You might notice this a bunch in auto racing, but it's also used for things like dealing with graphics machines that make noise.

>Would there ever be a situation where one person is managing both the audio and video?

Most local TV news is automated nowadays. One centralized program operates the video switcher, playback, audio, etc, firing off pre-built cues that are placed in the script by the producer and director during preproduction."
livesound,fdkqueb,t1_fdk3sks,1578509246.0,"So there's two types of intercom connections, called two wire and four wire. Four wire intercom has a separate path for audio going in each direction between two points. Two wire intercom carries audio in both directions down the same conductor. Both have their place, so our shows have a mix of both. If we want people on four-wire and two-wire segments of the intercom to talk to each other, we need what's called a hybrid. If you talk into a two-wire intercom while listening to it, you will hear your own voice coming back out of it. The four wire users talking into that two-wire segment don't want to hear themselves echoing back out of the two wire, so the hybrid attempts to cancel it out.

Nulling the line is when the hybrid makes noises into the two-wire line to test its frequency response. It needs to do this because that frequency response can change depending on what's connected to the line, and mismatches between what the hybrid is trying to cancel, and the actual frequency response of the line, will cause undesired audio to leak through the hybrid."

4:1 sounds like twice as much compression as 2:1, right? Wrong. It's three quarters of the way to a brick wall, compressing just 25% harder than 2:1. 8:1 sounds like twice as much as 4:1, but it's only compressing about 12% harder, and it's about 88% of the way to a brick wall. 50:1 sounds insane, right? It's almost a brick wall, but not that much closer to a brick wall than 8:1, the difference between 8:1 and 50:1 is about the same as the difference between 4:1 and 8:1. Crazy huh?

* Building ""stem"" mixes that make it easier to build other mixes by only having to worry about contributions from a small number of groups rather than from all of your individual input channels

* Broadcast mixes move around a LOT as you go between pre-taped packages, so you have a lot more need for single handles that you can use to manipulate groups of channels (you can use DCAs too but for some reason I've never gotten the hang of remembering that channels are under DCA control, it's easier for me to remember that the audio is flowing through a group)

* I personally like compressing things in groups, it makes sure that a loud hit on the ice won't duck my announcers, for example"
livesound,fdg0nec,t1_fdfkxws,1578375749.0,"The big thing is routing and how your mix is organized.

On a Calrec there is no concept, whatsoever, of a sequence of numbered channels. If you're ever locating a specific channel in a menu somewhere, channels are listed by what faders on the surface they're assigned to. This is because you don't just have one stage box with a bunch of channels plugged into it that all originate from a single 40 foot stage. You are dealing with sources that hit your from all over a building, and it's logistically much easier to group them *physically* by where they come from in the building, but *arrange* them in your desk according to what makes sense for the show you're mixing. Reducing the number of *intermediary* cross-patches makes your show a lot easier to organize. On the Studer Vista you have to patch sources to channels, then arrange those channels on your surface, and there's no painless way to make changes to your patch because you don't think of the channels on your surface in terms on what channel numbers they are, but the console forces you to reason about them in those terms.

Another great thing that broadcast desks do is give every individual fader a second layer, essentially. If you've got more sources than faders, the traditional solution is layers, but pressing that layer button changes every single fader on the entire desk, including faders you might want to still keep your fingers on. You could put those faders on the second layer, or you can do what broadcast desks do, which is give every fader a second layer for just that fader. My announcers are doing an open on hand mics, I can put those on the back side of the faders I'm using for their headsets because both things aren't going to be used at the same time, and flipping those faders doesn't affect the faders where I have my tape machines etc.

Another thing broadcast desks do is shitloads of routing and paths. Top end Calrecs have 1500 total audio paths, hundreds of which can be auxes, or groups, or masters. The big thing eating paths isn't so much your inputs as your outputs, of which you need a ton to feed all of the various things that need them. Tape land is particularly hungry for feeds. On one show I did last year, I had to build submixes of 6 different gymnastics events going on at the same time so that any of them could be played back from tape at any time."

It's a simple fact that being a victim of terrorism, mass shootings included, is one of the rarest things that can happen to you in this country, and rare events shouldn't be used as a basis for policy. I think we all agree, for example, that the USA massively overreacted to 9/11 and it shouldn't have been used to justify our massive reduction in civil liberties over the next decade. If you can't see how criminalizing tens of millions of people is a massive overreaction to the ""mass shooting"" problem, you either believe they are more common than they actually are (thanks to the availability heuristic and media sensationalism), or you simply have no sense of proportion."

Foodforthought,fcigq06,t1_fcavbio,1577662274.0,">Who is talking about that kind of ban though? I've never heard that from anyone really. 

Apart from everything in /r/NOWTTYG, Democrats proposed legislation banning and confiscating common firearms and accessories on the very first day they took control of the Virginia state legislature, and such bans are listed in bold text at the very top of their national party platform. The notion that ""nobody is talking about bans"" is a bit ridiculous and directly contradicts observable reality.

>A more obvious move is just normal gun regulation, like many other countries have. Perhaps some sort of effective registration or licensing etc. 

How does this actually address criminal use of firearms? This is the sort of thing that I'm talking about, this chain of logic that first starts from the premise ""we need stricter gun laws,"" which then follows to ""this is a stricter gun law, therefore we should do it,"" without bothering to connect the actual effect of that law to an actual goal in the realm of public-safety. It reveals that the goal has nothing to do with public safety, the goal is simple prohibition of firearms by whatever incremental means are possible.

>Is it authoritarian that we require a license to drive a car? Lol

Aside from the fact that the point of driver's licensing is to certify competency in an attempt to reduce *negligent* motor vehicle deaths and injuries, and the problems related to firearms are due to *intentional* malicious behavior (i.e. a fundamentally different problem which requires fundamentally different solutions).

Aside from the fact that you don't need a driver's license to merely *own* a car and drive it on private property, and a license is only required to drive on *public* roads, which is already the case with guns, where a permit is required to carry them in public in most jurisdictions.

Aside from the fact that the need to certify competency before letting people loose with two-ton machines that kill tens of thousands of people a year despite that certification, is broadly agreed upon, and what makes many proposed firearms regulations authoritarian is the fact that those regulations are not broadly agreed upon, especially by the people actually affected by them.

Aside from those things, imagine a world where events like that Charlottesville Nazi running people over were, instead of being considered the behavior of a deranged individual, were used as pretext by a powerful anti-car lobby to restrict the ownership of motor vehicles by civilians. ""Nobody needs a high-horsepower assault car whose only purpose is to exceed the speed limit and make it easier to run people over."" Imagine if driver's licensing, instead of being a simple certification of competency to drive, were instead used as a financial and class barrier to intentionally deny driving privileges to everyone not rich or well-connected enough to get through the process. Imagine if you could meet all of the legal requirements for a driver's license, pay all of the appropriate fees and jump through all of the appropriate hoops (none of which have anything to do with public safety), and *still* have an unaccountable bureaucrat arbitrarily deny your license. Imagine if you had to give ""good cause"" for being issued a driver's license, and ""because I need to drive to work"" wasn't considered a valid reason. And now imagine that crimes committed by *unlicensed* drivers were used as a pretext by lawmakers to make the process of getting a driver's license even more difficult.

This is the situation, today, for gun owners in states like Hawaii, California, New York, and others.

>Should people be allowed to have rocket launchers and missiles too, just in case?

People *are* allowed to have rocket launchers. It's a $200 permit and you go through the same background check that you need to buy a regular-old firearm. Actual off-the-shelf civilian availability is pretty low but any reasonably handy person could build their own out of model rocketry or fireworks parts pretty easily.

The reason you don't hear about crimes being committed with homemade RPGs is because they are simply impractical for crime. Ditto with suppressors (something like three crimes, total, have been committed with legally-owned suppressors in the last century) and machine guns (the only crime committed with a legally-owned machine gun since WW2 was committed by a police officer)."
