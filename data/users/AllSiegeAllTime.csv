It hasn't been spread worldwide because companies dont think there'd be a market for it (men handling their birth control, even if it was one procedure once).

On that note, in every developed country the rate of hysterectomy is higher than vasectomy despite vasectomies being simpler, less invasive/dangerous, and reversible.

That said, from what reading I have done it's hard to see Stalin as anything other than a power hungry opportunist who wielded the rhetoric of socialism as opposed to a true believer who was overzealous in his application of the theory.

I'm no ML but I can respect that Lenin seemed to truly believe in the proletarian dictatorship and that he very likely would have worked toward the withering of the state, where it's hard for me to imagine Stalin ever doing such a thing voluntarily.

But, and I know this is likely the question and where it gets thorny, there's no doubt that imperialist U.S. and other forces (nevermind WWII) very likely gave the USSR little choice if they wished to simply exist.

However considering the world we live in, I'm more concerned with harm reduction day to day than in any efforts to reduce the state we have, i.e. I'm okay and actually prefer the current state providing food assistance/public housing etc given the actual alternative.

Put another way, given that we live in corporatist hell I strongly prefer the authority of the federal government over the equally powerful but unaccountable authority of McAmazonFaceDisney LLC and can happily engage with the machine to reduce harm as much as possible with what power we do have to influence such things.

Anarchy is in the tradition of Libertarian Socialism, or the libertarian side of the left. These are people who ended up imprisoned by Lenin and Stalin because while they supported socialism they rejected the authority of the state and Lenin's ""dictatorship of the proletariat"".

Rojava, the territory of the Kurds in Syria is as far as I know the most thriving libertarian socialist society right now, with horizontal organization of power and workers cooperatively owning the value that their labor produces and involved in voting for what is produced, why, and what is done with the surplus.

If walmart paid their lowest employees $15/hr they would profit $10B a year instead of $15B, and we would all save on earmarking tax money to avoid starvation and destitution of the working class.
