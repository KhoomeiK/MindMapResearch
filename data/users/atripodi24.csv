dogs,ff9mbyr,t3_es3qbm,1579715999.0,"Congrats!! I know how hard it is to clip nails on a dog who screams and squirms!  He is adorable, I am obsessed with shibas!

I made similar progress with my girl Ali, after like you, the first time I cut her nails, I hit the quick and it looked like someone was murdered in my house haha. After nearly 2 years  of high reward treats and my husband holding her while I clipped, I can now do her nails with her laying on the floor with no help and she gets belly rubs and a treat per foot.  Such a relief!"
k9sports,ff6jove,t1_ff6htd5,1579628644.0,"BOW is only between the WD and WB, one of the champions entered cannot win that.  

I totally get how hard it is explaining it all to people not involved. My husband isn't involved at all and I just tell him I won or lost haha.  It's not really 2nd at all, that's just the order they list everything for the judge's  book.  I'd just say since your dog has not gotten all the points yet to become a Champion, he beat all of the non-champions that day, males and females."
AmItheAsshole,ff6iit9,t1_ff4j703,1579627934.0,"Yea, its disgusting.  I don't get why people think it's ok."
k9sports,ff6h6bb,t1_ff6az48,1579627111.0,"So, as you know the Winners Dog and Winners Bitch go into the Best of Breed competition.  In your scenario, you had already beaten all the non-champion males and by going BOW, you beat all the non-champion females.  By being in the Best of Breed ring, the judge does have the option to give the WD or WB Best of Breed(which also automatically makes them BOW), I'm not saying it's completely rare, but it does and can happen here and there.  The WD or WB could also go Best of Opposite Sex also.  

There's no Reserve Best of Breed.  For all of the champions entered, the awards available at each show are Best of Breed, Best of Opposite Sex, Select Dog and Select Bitch, and then at some specialty shows, they will also offer Award of Merit depending on the size of the entry. This link does a good job of explaining the different classes and requirements and on page 11, provides the progression of the awards.

k9sports,ff5y72y,t3_erd89i,1579614093.0,"We had a double obedience novice only trial on Saturday.  We had one leg already, so I was hoping to finish our CD.  

Summer is my Novice A dog and since we started in Beginner Novice last summer, she was always pretty nervous at trials and definitely stressed some while in the ring. Saturday showed me how far she has come, she was not nervous or stressed at all and so many things were far improved.

Our run in the first trial was an NQ.  During the heel free, she was wide from me and then I lost her on the about turn and she decided to heel the rest of the way on my right side, but it was some nice heeling on the right side haha.  This is also my fault too because I forgot I could give that 2nd command for points off.  Oh well, I was still happy with the rest of her run.  

At the 2nd trial, heel free was much much better and we Q'd and after the sit and down stay, we wound up getting 1st place with a score of 189.5!!!  I am so proud of my girl!!  2 legs down, 1 to go!  Next trial is in 2 weeks, fingers crossed!

Training brag: we've been training in open and she's been having a hard time with the dumbbell and holding it.  We did the retrieve on flat and she sprinted to get it and then brought it all the way back to me before dropping it.  For the retrieve of the high jump, we've been using a tennis ball for now to get her used to carrying something over the jump.  Yesterday, we did it with the dumbbell for the first time and I was so happy she retrieved it over the jump and held it while jumping, then she dropped it when she got to me again.  I didn't do anything and she picked it up and held it!!  I of course jackpotted that and had a big party haha.  So proud of my little girl!!  Here she is at the lake, we had a lot of time to kill between trials, so we went for a walk at the lake: https://imgur.com/pPE6b4h"
k9sports,ff5x47k,t3_erhyth,1579613160.0,"Congrats! But actually Best of Winners is way more than 2nd place.  He was picked as the best non-champion that day, so that is definitely a big deal!"
k9sports,fekg5xo,t3_epdv4v,1579199354.0,"A GSD we train with has this problem.  Hers is due to stress.  When she really gets worked up, her owner puts her in a down and ignores her until she stops and then continues."
k9sports,feh4ni4,t3_eoxfik,1579109059.0,"We are working on this now with my girl.  We have been doing pivoting on a bowl and also including pocket hands.

Agility,fedyf4x,t1_feamkfi,1579022524.0,"Even more than 1 years old.  In AKC, you can't even compete until they are 15 months, but a lot of people would recommend x-rays to make sure the growth plates are closed."

When something new comes up with my dogs, I research the shit out of it, plus my best friend is a vet, so she doesn't mind when I ask her questions, plus I have a great relationship with my regular vet.  

Again, I am extremely sorry for your loss."
DogCare,fdwh7zm,t1_fdw51au,1578758659.0,"Also agree.  I've given it to many of my dogs when they have had injuries.  It's not something they should be on long term, but I think this is a sad and very unfortunate situation where OP's dog had a bad reaction to it."

k9sports,fdr1fna,t3_emjxfi,1578678215.0,"I would wait until your dog is a little older to start doing this.  Bigger dogs need longer for their growth plates to fully close.  I know for agility, dogs cannot compete until they are at least 15 months old.  At 1 year old, your dog is still a puppy.  Here is a chart that shows what kind of exercise is appropriate at each age for a puppy: https://www.facebook.com/OutbackDogTraining/photos/a.823833484487243/928809733989617/?type=3&theater

k9sports,fda9j71,t3_ekf3xj,1578243294.0,"I am currently only doing obedience with both of my dogs.

Summer- 3 years old German Shepherd mix- My Novice A dog

In 2019, we got our BN title with all 3 scores in the 190's and one 1st place and then we got one leg towards our CD.  This is definitely a big deal because Summer gets very nervous in trial environments, she's definitely getting better though.

One goal is to get our CD.  We have one leg so far and have 3 trials this month, fingers crossed!
Another goal is to make progress in our Open training.  She is doing well and is really enjoying it, but dumbbell and command discrimination progress is a little slow.  But she does make me laugh and that reminds me to keep it fun all the time.  I've realized how important it is to make everything a game while training.  

Ali- 4 year old Rottie mix

She was doing agility, but after an injury, we started obedience training in November and she is doing amazing and really loves training. My goal is to enter her in Beginner Novice by the end of the year.

We're still managing her injury, but I am hoping by the spring we'll be able to run in Fast CAT.  She only needs about 3 more runs before she gets her BCAT title.  Obviously her health is way more important to me, but she really loves to run and loves Fast CAT, so I am really hoping we can get her running in Fast CAT again."

Is it nutritional DCM? If so, please make sure your vet reports it."
