http://ghostbikes.org/howto

> How to Make and Install a Plaque: Many ghost bike plaques are simply laminated computer printouts. Painting by hand, stenciling, silkscreening, and other techniques can be time intensive but produce beautiful results.  In NYC we partnered with a local artist collective who we paid to [silkscreen an image and text](http://www.flickr.com/photos/19363530@N02/6995819445/in/pool-638349@N23) onto metal street signs.  You could also have signs made by commercial sign makers.

> In New York City, street sign posts are on nearly every corner and make a perfect location for installing plaques. Signage varies from city to city, so you may need to alter the following for your particular circumstances. Standard-issue sign poles have pre-drilled 3/8” holes spaced 1 inch apart. We bolt the plaques into place using ¼” bolts and nuts, then bend the bolts or mar the threading with vice grips. Bending or otherwise damaging the bolts makes them harder to remove."

> Geoff Rickly: How did you feel the first time you heard Johnny' Cash's rendition of ""Hurt""'? How did you feel when you realized it would be his last will as a musician?

> Trent Reznor: Rick Rubin has been a friend for a long time, and he called me asking how I felt about Johnny covering ""Hurt."" I was flattered, but frankly, the idea sounded a bit gimmicky to me. I really didn't put much thought into it, as I was working on something at the time and was distracted. A few weeks later, a CD shows up with the track. Again, I'm in the middle of something and put it on and give it a cursory listen. It sounded... weird to me. That song in particular was straight from my soul, and it felt very strange hearing the highly identifiable voice of Johnny Cash singing it. It was a good version, and I certainly wasn't cringing or anything, but it felt like I was watching my girlfriend fuck somebody else. Or something like that. Anyway, a few weeks later, a videotape shows up with Mark Romanek's video on it. It's morning; I'm in the studio in New Orleans working on lack De La Rocha's record with him; I pop the video in, and... wow. Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps... Wow. I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn't mine anymore. Then it all made sense to me. It really made me think about how powerful music is as a medium and art form. I wrote some words and music in my bedroom as a way of staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone. Some-fucking-how that winds up reinter-preted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning-dif-ferent, but every bit as pure. Things felt even stranger when he passed away. The song's pur-pose shifted again. It's incredibly flattering as a writer to have your song chosen by someone who�s a great writer and a great artist."
