HorrorGaming,ffr2631,t3_eunzqu,1580148819.0,"Silent Hill is such a great franchise, my favourite game of all time is actually SH4. But I feel like this just isn't true. Konami aren't the same anymore, and even if they were working on 2 Silent Hill games it wouldn't be by the same team and therefore might be even worse than what can be expected. Once it is confirmed I'll believe it, but for now it is just another rumour"

AskReddit,fep5ki9,t3_eq1wzh,1579312624.0,"Alot of money would be great, but I don't think money would resolve all my issues. To make me 100% happy right now, I would be off Universal Credit, helping my partner run a really successful business and be coping with my borderline personality disorder, separation anxiety and depression and autism alot better than I am now. But I'm greatful that I'm alive, I have an amazing partner and a gorgeous cat and live in a nice flat."

Jesse is only 3/4 at the moment, so we are hoping that he has a long and enjoyable life with us❤ Do you have anymore pets?"
