overcoming,ffhbobm,t3_etlnhp,1579929041.0,"Change your diet and start running. Like 1-2 miles a day, and increase every week. Cut sugar and gluten. I wouldn't do caffeine either if you have anxiety. Meditate, it takes awhile but start the guided meditations on youtube. You'll start to recognize where you go wrong in your head and be able to stop attacks and episodes before they even begin. Also try yoga, its good for PTSD and anxiety. Look up Seane Corn, she had OCD and anxiety since she was a kid, and overcame it with yoga. She finally realized her patterning and OCD was because of trauma."
awakened,fff9c9c,t1_ffec9m6,1579878916.0,"It’s scary to go deep. But you will when you are good and ready. Practice meditation yoga and great fullness. Exercise and eat good. Take care of yourself. You are changing.

You are not who you used to be but not yet who you will become. So it’s a lull period. stay good. And when you are ready, you will explore those questions with grace. There is no “who” is guiding you. Because essentially you don’t even exist. We are all one. It’s the source energy you’re becoming aware of it"
awakened,fff8wan,t3_et4zpm,1579878620.0,"Yeah I’m experiencing that this year. I became extremely anxious when I realized that I’m alive. Lol you would think it’s a glorious thing but I truly realized like what the hell are we doing here, why is this all happening...why am I alive and awake? What does this all mean? What am I supposed to be doing? I was depressed too. I thought I was going nuts. People would just laugh like yeah we all don’t know welcome to the club. But I truly was seeing it for what it was, we are like conscious robots and blood flows in our bodies and we need food to eat and we poop like WHAT and i think?? I felt lesser than. But i realized everyone else is in the same boat and so then I was able to connect more. I also cried in yoga. You may have some suppressed emotion or some old pain coming up.

I believe you are “awakening” it’s when you become aware of what you really are. And if you start using this to meditate, it can become a useful beautiful tool to connect with the earth and others around you. 
But it seems like there is some pain you need to work through. Look up “the dark night of the soul” on YouTube, it’s a spiritual depression. Very similar to an existential crisis"

Soulnexus,ffeqhef,t3_et1mkc,1579860433.0,"This is happening to me, and it is exhausting. I quit alcohol and started running. I feel a lot better with depression but now once in awhile I’ll experience sudden anxiety attacks that I never had. I feel defeated I was for sure running would help. But here’s what I concluded...

1. I haven’t given it much time. 
2. Now that we’ve stripped away what we used to mask it, we are getting to the core beliefs and feelings. That’s why you’re still feeling shitty. You are essentially peeling away layers of an onion. This is rock bottom. Once you pass here, you get a better understanding of why you feel the way you do. This pain coming up has always been there, just masked. Allow yourself to feel this pain, and trauma. Work with it and sit with it. Then you will start to ease. 

Takes time. it will come up a lot until you are ready"
SpiritualAwakening,ffeollx,t3_et6lk9,1579857573.0,"Yes. I’m working with my inner child as well. Not sure if you’re already doing inner child work, but you can start listening to him/her when your down, upset, happy, and just emotional. Your child self is the part of you that will guide you to happiness. To love, spontaneity, creativity, and exploration. They look at the world with a set of fresh eyes. 

Listen to that part of you. Meditate with your inner child in a safe place, mine is a grassy field. Tell them it’s okay to cry, play with them in your meditation. What would “little you” say to “big you”? follow them. 

For it is us adults that have been domesticated and programmed to form a reality that isn’t fun anymore, that isn’t playful. The real us is who we were when we were kids, when we were first born. Our problems only came with age and through society, our problems are learned behaviors. 

In shamanism, when you meditate or journey with your inner child the goal is to get them to willingly hug you comfortably...without forcing them. And ask them how much they trust you. You will there find out how much work you need to do. Some people take years before they can hug their inner child"

Good enough reason to start not believing them. But it takes time. 

I can get into details on some techniques you can start doing. But I want this overall message to be about this....

You haven't even lived a quarter of your entire life. Some people have been depressed for 16 years (your entire life age) and come out of it strong, entrepreneurs, authors, comedians, writers. This is just a period of your life. It is not everything that exists, it just SEEMS that way. Just know that, and it will give you some ease. My entire life changed in just ONE year. I no longer think the same way I did a YEAR ago. Please allow yourself more time....there is a lesson to be learned here. Be patient with life. You have seen all bad happen so far, of course you believe that's all there is. But wait until you get into your adult life, explore other things, and as you grow you will change and have more insight....

I'm just saying there is more to life than what you do for a job. It is not what this is about. It's an ideology within itself to think you need to work a 9-5 tirelessly in order to achieve happiness somewhere in the future when you can have it now, in everything that you do.

But there is. It's a hard concept to understand, i can only tell you, i cant show you. There are things you can start doing to change how you think and feel. the brain is trainable. But it won't be overnight. I have been there. I was so mad that I was feeling this way, I knew something was wrong with me, that it was not OK, that I was not OK, and I just wanted to be normal. But everytime i wished it to be gone, it was still there. So I took away the wishing to be gone. Allowed it to happen. Then it wenton its own...... It's a meditation technique. I lost 30 lbs in 2 months from not eating, i was bed ridden, i couldnt sleep from the anxiety. It indeed is not ok. I am not telling you to accept that this is your life forever, I am telling you to stop resisting so hard, because you being depressed about being depressed, is what keeps you stuck there. It takes a little work to understand what I am saying I guess, but I started doing yoga and practicing meditation which allowed me to separate from these thoughts. I read a shit ton of self help books. I started running. I stopped drinking for a bit. I ate super healthy foods. I changed things. If you change nothing, nothing will change. It is worth a try. I get you are afraid that this is happening to you. You definitely dont deserve it to be, but you can unfuck your mind. Trust me. You are more than what you think. While your in bed, can you journal things you love to do or have once loved to do? and try to pull in some sort of plan? If you aren't there yet, getting any kind of momentum helps.

That thought alone, was the very reason I would extend my depression into another cycle. Everytime I pushed the feeling away, it would come back stronger. Youre attached to feeling better right this second. I will tell you this, YOU WILL FEEL BETTER. But first you have to accept, where you are right now. Be OK with it. AND THEN it comes. Stop pushing it away, the very reason you want it gone is the same reason ""IT"" exists. The more you want it gone, the more upset you are that it is still there. Stop wanting it gone. Accept it right now. And you will realize over time, it is gone......

A tree in the ground, where they're supposed to be. The sky above, where it is supposed to be. We already are, where we belong. Or else we wouldn't exist, or have died off already from not being able to survive. 

Now, you are totally identified with your mind. You think you are your thoughts. You're in the ego. Judging everything about yourself, what you should be doing thinking and feeling. And the more you resist what IS, you will suffer more. Accept what you are feeling right now. Accept that it will pass, and it will change. Know that you've had circumstances happen to you that are making you feel this way. But it is not you. It just happened to you. Take a moment to breathe. Who would you be if you didn't think this way? Better probably! So dump those thoughts. Every time they pop up, say ""Ah, OK, a depressive thought again. Goodbye"" let it pass. Watch your mind go, know that is chatter, it is not you...

Get up even when the mind doesn't want to. Recognize there is two of you. The mind, and then YOU! Don't listen to the mind, it talks and talks. Eventually, it dissipates. Stretch, eat good healthy food, write goals. This is a moment, it is not your entire life. Trust me, I have been there."
Shamanism,fdev7b0,t3_ekui2h,1578347286.0,"Yes, experiencing this now. I was able to say no. It gave me hope, the power to say no. You have the right to do whatever it is, that your heart craves. In that way, we are able to share that love and help others. I quit my  9-5 job because I was terribly depressed, left a stuck relationship that I wasn't ready for, and am moving across the country to be where I always dreamed of. I like nature and medicine but I do not know what to do with it yet. But that is OK. there is more for me to learn, about myself first, before the career comes. A lot of people suffer from this issue because they awaken, or become conscious, that they are stuck in societies beliefs of who we should be and what we should do. Create your own path. I am taking a year off to travel, to explore, ignite my creativity and passions ( I still have a bartending job to survive) and then everything will come....not the opposite. 

When you try to fit ALL that you are, into a box, we suffer. Step out of the box. So worth it. Don't worry about what others say. You will get a lot of backlash, but afterall its your life right?"
awakened,fdeuk97,t3_ekznwc,1578346907.0,"I've thought this too LOL. So it's a paradigm actually. Once you feel guilty about it, your in the ego. Everyone has an ego and desires. Enjoy them without getting attached to it, getting attached means you keep wanting more and more and seek only that. Just love all that you do, the ego things you desire, the lull periods in between. Know that it is all part of life, the up and down, so knowing that enjoy that it is happening as it should. As soon as youre in it, all insecure and shit, you're identified with being your ego. 

Also, the feeling you get from music and film and others company, is ""the flow state"". It is nothing to be ashamed of, like I said, it is until you CRAVE and want it to be yours all the time, is when the world says ...no no …..there is this too. and that too."
overcoming,fdeslwq,t3_ekwbf5,1578345747.0,"You feel stuck because you're living a life that isn't in tune with who you really are. You're living someone else's life. Finish this year out, but based on your choosing, do whatever you want after that. College? Take a break? Take a year off to travel or exercise? Get an apartment?

Change things up. When you change, you get change. But nothing will change, if you change nothing. You see? So there is hope, you just have to take a step....forward. Even if small.

Here's what I say. Any moment you have time to yourself, maybe before bed, Journal down things that you LIKE to do, things you WISH you could do. For an example mine was, "" I'd like to run a half marathon this year"". Then march your butt to a starbucks, make a excel sheet of a training guide. That is what I did. THE GUIDE is what keeps me on track.

I also laminated, a chart, labeled ""sunday-saturday"" and I check off whether Ive taken my vitamins, worked out, read, and meditated. It also keeps me on track.

You are struggling with the start of it though correct? One small strategy that has helped me just do it, is to not think about it. Just get up by counting 5-4-3-2-1 UP. Just start moving. Don't think about how it wont matter, how none of it matters, how youll never get there. That is all mind chatter. You are not your mind. Just move. Just walk. And eventually overtime, once you get momentum, youre in a constant flow of getting shit done. Then you can think clearly about your future.

&#x200B;

In summary,

\-make lists daily

\-write goals (short term and long term)

\-make a plan

\-give yourself an hour each night with yourself thinking about what you want from life and how you can get there

\-bring your laptop to a Starbucks and google things. How to do this or that. Look up Mel Robbins. Awesome tricks. 

\-read self-help books"
SuicideWatch,fdepcjp,t3_ekwy6f,1578343818.0,"grrr. Makes my heart hurt, that everyone on here is like yes me too. It keeps re-enforcing the idea that this is life. It is NOT all there is to life. This is just our culture, that we have created. That we HAVE to do these things to survive. A protocol. That is why we feel so stressed. I too was just in this place. I left everything because it hurt so bad. A relationship I was stuck in, a job I hated, friends, shitty food and alcohol that covered up the pain. I left it all. I looked inward, I meditated, I ran miles everyday. I said I will not be a statistic. And each day it gets better.  I packed my shit and am moving across the country in June. I am not putting pressure on myself about a career (Im 26). I just ended school and it made me depressed. My mental health (and yours) is more important than ANY CAREER JOB OR SHIT that our society tells us we have to do. Your life, what makes you YOU, is more important than WHAT YOU DO for a job. When we identify who we are, with what we do, is when we suffer. 

I will be bartending on the beach in California when I head out there. To my parents, it seems like a step back, but thinking of a career drove me to be borderline suicidal. I don't know yet. I am changing. My career will come to me, when I learn more about me, and what I love. It will come. But love yourself first. Take care of yourself first. I am excited to be in a different environment, because I chose myself. Cant wait to see what experiences I will have. Life changes. Things change. It wont be the same way forever, as long as you don't DO and THINK the same way forever. 

I hope this makes sense to you. Be different. You don't have to do anything. You don't have to be married either. You can literally do anything you want to do, everyday with a little effort

Meditation,fczpt5n,t1_fczmvos,1578106467.0,"Ill put it simply....you know how when you were a child you were much happier? you only realize now that as a kid you were so blissfully happy because you DID NOT KNOW you were! You did not grasp ahhhh this is happiness. you just were. it is only when you look back at it, you say ahhhh i was so happy then....you see? As soon as you KNOW it...it is gone"
Meditation,fczmvos,t3_ejnk72,1578104701.0,"Ah. I relate to this. Ram Dass discussed this in his lecture, look him up. Love his talks. There a quote on this something along the lines of a monk asking his master how long itll take to become enlightened and basically the master said if you think this way you never will.

its the idea that knowing you DONT KNOW EVERYTHING gives you all the knowledge there is to know. Crazy right?

Essentially, yes you have to drop the idea that you are doing it for a benefit. You are just being present with each moment because everything is only a ""now"". Drop the motivation. As soon as you have desire for something, it falls apart. Because you will always lose it if you desire it. You will always want more. Like a drug. Its a habit of our EGO. Your spirit is timeless, it just is. Present. And that is what youre connecting with, the moment. Maybe yeah you will become more beneficial from it, but its not something that is sizeable here....we aren't talking about do more get more.....its all about the quality and the moment within it. Don't look for an end goal. 

The same part of you that is wondering if you do more you will get more, is the ego talking. Thus you may have not gotten deeper in your meditation practice yet. because when deeper you realize, there is no here or there, you just are. no goal no end no beginning."

It's the sound of singing bowls. It was my first transition into a NON guided meditation. Still sound, but the sound gets you deeeeeep. Now its all I do. Profound spiritual vibe to it.

Also, attend a silent meditation retreat. It will help A TON"
Meditation,fczkxd0,t3_ejpeg4,1578103485.0,"Perhaps the anxiety comes up in meditation because it needs to be addressed and looked at. Sit with the feeling of your heart, don't let it stop you from meditating. If you can sit through it, you prove to yourself that you are OK. Sometimes once something happens once, your brain remembers it and it just becomes a bad habit. Its not the meditation that isn't helping, its either some weird brain association you've unconsciously created while you meditate, or even more accurately, its past pain coming up. It wont go away easily until you learn to sit with it. to really feel it. then it loses its grasp. after all, that is what meditation is about. it is not always sunshine and rainbows.

SuicideWatch,fczianx,t3_ejjdgq,1578101862.0,"Ask yourself these two questions:

1. Is this thought absolutely true? that you're not cut out to live in this world?
2. Who would you be without this thought? 

The thought and the thinking is the issue. Good news it can be changed. The world isn't the issue and YOU are not the issue. Just some negative programming you have developed over the years from experiences. 

Don't be scared this is so normal. I went through this. We've created a materialistic world with a ton of pressure, its causing a lot of youngsters to feel this way. But you don't have to live that way...you don't need to compete. You could own your own business, or be a painter, or do your own thing. It changes. LIFE CHANGES. I am NOT the same person I was years ago. SO many new people came into my life that have changed my perspective. and guess what? the good news is your life will GARUNTEED change. Because that is life. It will not stay the way it is now. That alone gave me hope. Stick it out to see how it will change, because it will. Think about it...you've only lived 20 years. If you lived your entire life all over again (doubled) you'd still only be 40 and have a ton more to go. 

People changed their lives at 40, 50, 60. I would start with treating your body right and watch your mind change. Start running, eating healthy, cutting toxic people out. Write and write about a life that you wish you were living and see what you can do to actively change that....because we are manifesters. we can change anything.....

get the book Prescription for Nutritional Healing.

it lists every disease physically and mentally and how to recover with herbs and diet. Tea instead of alcohol. Cut it. Start RUNNING. Aerobic exercise helps produce more serotonin by reducing inflammation. Music and run. You need new coping skills. Much more to life than this, but you have to do the work"

For me, I've come to realize is more of a spiritual thing for me. I am not who I used to be, but I am not yet full who I am. It's a lull period. Careful when you say you want to feel normal again, I said this too. I wanted to go BACK to the way I was. But you can't. You CAN however become anything you want, someone new, that thinks different thoughts and feels again, except more. It's possible. But you have to have to, do the work my friend. Put the booze away, focus on yourself, get your mind and body right. Read some books, learn more. Disassociation comes from you not being connected with your spirit. You just exist, merely because to be in your body is too painful. There may be some trauma that needs to get unfolded. Some pain that's hidden. Gotta do the work tho, cant shove it down. But after the dark night of the soul, is true expansion and light. Promise <3"
