Catholicism,ffd285i,t3_espk2p,1579811972.0,"I think I know what you mean. It can be difficult to try to actually practice practice some of the tricky parts without being called judgmental or legalistic. Even among Catholic acquaintances and family members.

 My aunt is engaged, she is divorced and has not sought annulment, so she's not free to marry. But apparently mentioning that is being mean.

My husband's brother and fiance were both raised Catholic but are not marrying in the Church, a lot of people don't seem to understand that this is a sad thing."

If possible you two should be on the same page about pre-marital sex, it would be very easy for one person to take unintentional advantage of a moment of weakness. My husband and I only made it because we were both on board."
CatholicWomen,ffaunpj,t3_esjbls,1579744888.0,"We had both of our sons baptisms six weeks after they were born. We had a large party for the first, but only because we had a lot of family help. 

The second party was smaller, I think 30ish people, but I had been a bridesmaid the day before, so we were trying to be lower key.

You can do it, especially if you have support, but depending on how the birth/baby is you may not feel up to it. I thought the first six weeks was pretty good, because the babies slept pretty constantly, but every kid is going to be different. After that they perked up more and then I started having to think about naps/sleep timing more."

Anyway, the number of pro-lgbt picture books is growing. Just last week I picked up a book about a spoiled cat who's owners get a puppy. But the owners are two women, and they have a baby at the end. I didn't notice until I got it home and actually read it. My kid is really starting to pick up on small details. So it's quite frustrating.

And Desmond is being abused. Even if you have no issue with drag queens or anything like that, children should not be dancing at clubs in drag. Or meeting with known child molesters. Or just put on parade and have public followings in general."

It turns out that brushing it just made it worse. Once I switched to using a wide toothed comb and preferably combing when wet/damp, it didn't get nearly as tangled. I also wore my hair in a braid a lot when I was younger.

I have two boys under three right now. My house is not very tidy and I'm exhausted."
prolife,fe9ecft,t1_fe8odmw,1578936819.0,"A huge part of feminism is examining where things come from. Are gender roles innate? Or from societal influences? So it should be important to know where abortion and birth control come from. Even if you still accept them, it's good to examine and acknowledge that they may not have come from great places.

Not saying this is how people should think. But it is definitely part of intersectionality, which is definitely a huge part of current feminism."

You are smart to not marry just to escape your parents' house, but if you do move in with your partner, it should be temporary and you should live somewhere else before the wedding. I think living together and potentially intermixing finances can make one less free to marry, because you are so mixed with the person already.

I do think you should move out. When I suggested a room, I meant that you can look for a room in a rental house that has common areas with other people. You don't need to be friends with your housemates, just be able to get along peacefully.
