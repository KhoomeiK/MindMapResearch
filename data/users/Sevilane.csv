She was raped until she was 16. He threatened to hurt her brothers if word got out. I found out and I got her out of it when my sister told me our cousin was having “fun” with her stepdad. I freaked out and said you idiot she is being raped! My cousin told me how no one believed her for a long time. I thought it was strange why my uncle kept touching me when I was little as he “picked” me up and say oh look how big you’ve gotten!” And I have told my mom many times. But she didn’t believe me.  Thank you so much for sharing this... I’ve been constantly telling people if a little girl or boy is telling you that someone is touching them, please don’t ignore it. Get them far away from the pedo. I’ve heard other people’s stories too and my ex bf was in a daycare and the 15 age guy that helped there was touching him when he was 7... just terrible"

It’d be nice to have an event digimon too that’s guaranteed to get after completing an event story for those that has like the worst luck, gets their fuel going and helps us feel abit better.
