bipolar,ffn01yf,t3_eu62c5,1580060634.0,"TRIGGER WARNING:  mentions of suicide and self harm


I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt at 17, dotted in and out of crisis centers for 2 years after that. Always came out with a depression/anxiety diagnosis.  Told them i was seeing and hearing things, but no one believed me.  I'm convinced they thought I was faking it. (Never mind me being in an honors college and having goals and ambitions but suddenly wandering the streets claiming my friends were all being murdered)

Suddenly felt better. Got off all my (admittedly not working) antidepressants and got a job/moved out/had a girlfriend. 

I was self harming every day and on the brink of a serious suicide attempt every other week.  The weeks i wasn't trying, i felt on top of the world.

I had such a traumatic experience with crisis centers and therapists that i didnt seek help at all until my current girlfriend.  Off of a friend's recommendation, I saw a specialty therapist and a new psych.  

Even then, it took me 6 months for my therapist to say I was misdiagnosed and I was bipolar.  

My main problem is I legit cannot remember what I did or do when I'm in an episode. My whole brain shuts off and nothing sticks.  Everything I do feels like I was a third-party to all of it, but like, as a passerby on the street.  Plus, lately I'm suspecting I might have schizoaffective. (Another debilitating psychotic break that made me quit my job and try suicide again)

I'm nearly 30.  It took 12 years and I'm still not where I should be.  

Here's to hoping your experience is better than mine."

Plus when Diane confronted him about it in season 5, he admitted that ""...nothing happened yet."", implying he was intending to sleep with Penny, but got interrupted. 

Good theory, but I don't see Bojack coming out of that one as the good guy.  Too much evidence against him."
