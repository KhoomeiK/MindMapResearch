If you did find a seller who would send you one, and assuming they're acting in good faith and it actually arrives in Australia, you'd probably be alright. You might have to complete a B709 form (which you can get by emailing your state's firearms department) for customs to release it, but there shouldn't be any issues in getting the import permit assuming you're in a legal state. 

There is also the issue of warranties. Gel blaster quality control is a bit lacking because they're basically on the same level as kids' toys.

askscience,fcjqtrf,t1_fcjpwse,1577699995.0,"That's not much different from a common form of placebo control where a real practitioner will administer a treatment which shouldn't provide any benefits (either because it's utter nonsense or because it's a treatment for something else). It's a really useful tool because it controls for a lot of factors that waitlists don't. Keep in mind that controlling for an effect doesn't necessarily mean eliminating it, but rather making sure it applies equally to both groups and thus is cancelled out when results are compared.

So this placebo control is useful because it controls for a number of factors that a waitlist doesn't, because in a waitlist control the people on the waitlist know they're not receiving a treatment. For example:

1. Placebo effects. In both the nonsense therapy and the real one, participants think the therapy is meant to be helpful, and therefore might feel a benefit as a result. 
2. Demand effects. If participants think the researchers want a particular outcome such as therapy being beneficial, they can be biased towards giving them the result they want, especially if the efficacy is being measured through self-report questionnaires etc. 
3. Non-specific treatment effects. Say you're trying to treat depression. Just having someone to interact with might cause a benefit in someone who's depressed because they're feeling lonely and isolated. It doesn't matter whether that interaction is part of a good therapy or a useless one."
