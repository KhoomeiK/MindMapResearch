I reported it to management (this happened at work) but they refused to do anything. I learned that the camera facing the bike rack was not plugged in to anything and there was no footage.

Edit: For further clarification, I felt that the person who tried to steal my bike had been watching me, because he got to work on busting my lock off and swapping out the seat literally the moment I locked it and went inside. (This was at 5 AM.) By the time I got my apron on somebody ran up to me and told me that my bike was being stolen. (It was electric, so I could see it being a prime target.) He got pretty pissed off and tried to play it off like it belonged to him in the first place, until I told him it's mine and I'm calling the police. He had a hammer and tried to be imposing but me and my coworker scared him off. I suspected he was vandalizing the bike as revenge, but had 0 proof since the camera I thought was watching everything was inactive."

Biking is okay, but I find walking to be more reliable as roads can often be littered with jagged metal, broken glass, nails, etc. I also had someone try to steal my bike, and after thwarting them my bike was vandalized and had slashed tires every day for a week. Walking has been my go to since then. I'd absolutely love for an improved public transportation, since our busses are just awful.
