They will breed the animals and places like Monkey World, they will send native species back to where they're from to go into a release program. They make sure the animals are 100% native via DNA checks. It's pretty cool."
LifeAfterNarcissism,ffgnd1d,t1_ffgbqi1,1579910265.0,"I know I'm ok 99% of the time. If I know I'm acting stupid I'll just remove myself. It used to be hard at first because he wanted to make it better, but he couldn't and it made him upset. Now he understands it's nothing he's done it's easier. I normally just need some time to myself and I'm all good again. As I said, I just go really quiet so it's nothing too severe. 

If I were him, I'd probably avoid me. Not because I wasn't nice or anything like that, but because we come from the same place. Luckily my guy grew up in a nice family. He was a little neglected since his parents worked long hours, but his sisters looked after him. I don't put anything on him. I try and keep all my crap to myself. I'll mention things later, but at the time I'll just pretend everything is ok until I've sorted it out. 

I guess I'd have compassion, how much I don't know. I've been there for my friends through a lot of crap. Maybe I would be ok with someone like me. Although the whole finding it hard to clean up/cook etc drives me bonkers. It's just a sign of adhd, frustrating as hell, but I couldn't live with someone else as messy as me. At least when my boyfriend is around I can force myself to keep things tidy (my place is always clean, stuff just takes a while to be put away)."

news,fff4mf0,t1_ffdqnas,1579875571.0,"The uk is going to end up on the list. Mainly due to having so many mainland students here. 50% of my old uni is now foreign students with a large majority being from China. The uni also only started back this week with most people only arriving back last weekend. It's going to be interesting to see what happens. I know a lot of students stayed over Christmas, but I know a lot travelled home. A friend of mine went back to HK, others to Spain, Poland, Romania etc (they're all part of my martial art classes). I'm really, really hoping the universities are on top of this as flu spreads like crazy around the student population. I got swine flu the year that was bad. This year I'm still recovering four weeks later from something. My throat is still swollen enough that I can't laugh or sing. I'm just glad I can talk again. I had no voice at all for three weeks.

Edit. I just checked the bbc news, it's in Scotland so its here already. Four students who travelled back from Wuhan gave been quarantined. It's not confirmed yet but hopefully it's ok."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fff3s23,t3_eszuii,1579874929.0,"I honestly say, work on you. Work on meeting people who make you feel good when you're around them. Watch how you talk and respond as well as I was a mess after leaving home and had no idea how to socialise. If you feel uncomfortable or don't like what someone is doing, don't ignore it. If you feel bad after meeting someone, don't see them again. 

Once you're ready and can recognise the signs of what could be an abusive relationship, start dating again. I've run from guys I've met. I dated a guy and knew I couldn't be with him long term and we split on good terms. I wouldn't say he was bad, but he knew he had those problems and didn't know if he could stop so we split before we got attached to each other. Still friends though. 

I'm with a very sweet guy now and I'm always scared I'm going to do something that's going to hurt him somehow. I know I'm not my mum and I try hard to be nice all the time, but my anxiety and cptsd issues can drive me bonkers because it can change my behaviour. Luckily I mostly just go quiet and maybe moody, but I don't lash out or anything."
CPTSD,fff2qnq,t3_et7aug,1579874115.0,"People would ask, I wouldn't say. I never mentioned any of the emotional abuse because well, how could I. I knew I didn't like my mum or being around her, but how do you explain it unless you're out and learning how regular/healthy people live? 

When she got mad at struck out. I was always told it didn't happen or it wasn't as bad or I must have done something really bad to deserve it and I was lying about what I'd done because I was bad. 

I think the computer technician figured it out. He was a good man and he kept me safe in school when no one else would. I still wish I could find him and thank him for what he did. He was the only adult I felt safe around, but I was still wary of him, because he was an adult. He also had to be careful because I was just a kid and getting close could get him in trouble."
karate,fff21kk,t1_ffemilv,1579873559.0,"At my grading we had to know bassai dai, do a random heian kata, then we had to spar. If you lost you didn't get your belt. The woman I was against started to cheat to win, was insane. She literally shoulder barged me to knock the wind out. I was being polite before then because I don't like hurting people, but it was game on after that. She lost and I got my belt, well I got it after we went to the pub and they made me sing on a table. Makes me laugh now. I was an angsty teen and I think I sang something from linkin park"
Anxiety,fff0p4h,t3_et1xah,1579872439.0,"Yep. It's a response to how I grew up. Now, two people yelling at each other, terrifying. One person yelling and completely losing control, terrifying. People yelling on the street randomly, again, it gets to me. It's all because of the stuff that happened to me growing up and my fear response/survival instinct kicking in. 

A year or so ago a new family moved in two doors down. Now, I live in a terraced street and you can hear/feel stuff if people slam doors or drop things hard enough. Well this guy would lose it a lot. He would yell, he was violent and would slam doors. He was acting just like my mum and he had me sitting safe in my living room, terrified. He kept attacking his girlfriend, in front of his baby and three year old. It was bad. We tried to help his girlfriend and we got her out, but she went straight back to him. They moved out one day and I'm actually sad about it. No matter how scared he made me, I now can't keep watch on her or the kids. 

I think the first time I realised I had issues around yelling was at my ex's mums place. His brother and his girlfriend got into a fight and I was terrified. I begged to leave the flat so we did. Cptsd. Caused by my mum and half brother (I don't know him, these are my only memories of him. I have none of him hurting me, I remember him being ok to me) yelling at each other when I was very small. I remember being in my push chair and he was jabbing her in the breasts while screaming at her. Yelling at her in my house, at his house... 

As for random yelling. Yeah, badly bullied in school, which meant even going outside in public could mean they'd come after me. Luckily most were dumb and liked to yell before they attacked, or just wanted to yell and scare me."
insaneparents,ffeyxub,t1_ffemuaq,1579870848.0,Nope. It becoming mainstream is the issue and companies like Facebook allowing people to post fake news as real news to increase their revenue.
BeAmazed,ffe5ubi,t1_ffdg5te,1579837490.0,"There were a lot of camera tricks back then, like painting scenes to make it look like they'll take a big fall if they miss a jump etc, but the stunts themselves are real. I haven't read up on this man's stunts to know exactly how they were done, but I'm guessing some were safer then they looked."
BeAmazed,ffe5krk,t1_ffc5zjd,1579837286.0,This. You can really see he followed his style in a lot of his stunts in his own early movies. He actually does quite a few of these stunts himself.

I figured out that because I never played on my own, I was always playing with my high level friends, my account had never leveled me up to play with people more my own level. So going back to playing alone a little, I was playing like a smurf. It was fun, but then my boyfriend wanted to learn Hammond on my account because it was easier.

I had similar situations. When something bad is happening, or people are yelling at me, I just shut down. Mum would be screaming at me, hitting me etc and I just didn't react. Reacting to anything made the situation ten times worse and giving her nothing was the only way to survive. Same thing happened in school. Life was easier if I just let everyone do whatever they wanted to do me, because if I didn't, I couldn't cope. Other kids would befriend me for a while, then they'd become targets, they couldn't handle even a small portion of what I was getting and would ditch me, that's how bad it was. My first breakdown I was around 9/10, I just started throwing up every single morning before school because I was being treated so badly. Then mum made things ten times worse and I began to throw up on none school days as well. 

I don't know when I actually broke completely. I just remember one day, I just gave up, happened when I was small and I eventually came back, only for it to happen again when I was around 16/17 and I never really recovered. 

As an adult, I have a great group of friends, but it took me so many years to learn to trust people, to learn how to actually communicate, how to be a friend. I have a good group now and I know how lucky I am to have them. It was freaking hard to do it though, but it was what I really wanted so I made it happen. As for my other issues, I need to be in therapy, it's too expensive and my doctor refuses to put me on the NHS wait list so I'm stuck."
CPTSD,ffc1b8b,t1_ffb9wk8,1579789015.0,"Same. I'm sure I was, but kids are. They want things, then they want something else. Its normal. 

Being called selfish for wanting normal things though wasn't cool. I was called selfish and spoiled for wanting the same stuff other kids had, for wanting my grandparents to buy me toys and games etc instead of just flaunting what they'd bought my cousins in front of me. Making a big fuss over it and never giving me anything. It hurt and I didn't understand why I couldn't have a pack of pokemon cards, or a lego set, or some cookies... 

I was also called selfish for never sharing my toys. When I did other kids would make a mess, I would get yelled at. They'd break them on purpose, again yelling at me, they'd steal them. Again, my fault somehow. I refused to share anything because if the other kid did something bad, I'd be the one in trouble. Hell. I stole my football back from some older boys who took it from me. I went straight home and told my mum, who then had me questioning if the ball I had taken from the cupboard, had taken to the park with me was actually mine and I hadn't just stolen their ball... what the hell?! I didn't play with that ball again..."

I wanted to be a normal kid. Have friends, wear normal clothes, be myself. Being myself wasn't allowed. I wasn't allowed to like music, wasn't allowed to like the tv I liked. Wasn't allowed to dress or figure out that stuff without being shamed. 

I advise you to head into a cheap clothing store, grab anything and everything you can find in your size and just try stuff on. That's what I do. I use Primark here in the uk, although it's not as cheap as it used to be. Figure out your style, enjoy figuring it out. If you don't see anything you like, just leave and come back in a few weeks when the styles have changed again. It's worth trying. I'm still figuring out my style and I'm 30. I don't look 30 luckily so I can get away with younger clothes, but it's still freaking hard. Most people have has 20 years by this point to figure out their style.

insaneparents,ffbx83b,t1_ffbi3px,1579785711.0,"Mine is called generalised anxiety disorder (gad). It showed its ugly head when I was a little kid in weird ways due to me not being able to handle all the stress of being abused constantly at school, at home etc. Then when I was in year 5, 9/10 years old, I guess I just kind of broke. Things were really bad and I started throwing up every morning, multiple times. Mum wasn't there, she had already gone before I woke up. I'd puke for a good hour or two before taking myself to school. Mum was so mad that I was ""faking"" being sick and instead of making things better she made them ten times worse and it got even worse. I started puking on the weekends and on holidays. She didn't care about me puking when she wasn't there, but when it started affecting her she was pissed. She was even more angry when she found out it was anxiety and I wasn't actually sick. No one explained what it was to me. I just got told off. I didn't understand. All I knew was that I was sick and in pain. 

As for why I skip as an adult. Habit. Plus if I eat anything I'll be too full to eat my regular meals and I'll end up tired in training because I haven't eaten all day. I had breakfast when I went away camping with my friends last year. It was just a roll with quorn stuff, an egg and a bit of cheese. I was so bloated and full after it I didn't eat anything apart from some ice cream. Kind of crazy."

I have asthma. It was bad when I was little and instead of taking me to a doctor to figure out why I was coughing all night, she just threatened to make me sleep in the shed because I was keeping her up. I was waking up in the night, unable to breathe and was coughing up all kinds of crap from my lungs. It happened again this christmas, getting that sick. It was terrifying and I ended up getting antibiotics to shift the infection and steroids to help me breathe. I was at my boyfriends place and he was worried about me. Not mad at me for coughing all night and keeping him up. Worried. He took me to the doctors, made sure I was ok. 

She refused to let me see a doctor when I broke my wrist twice, broke my foot and it took my karate class getting really worried about my infected toe and telling her to take me to a doctor to get it sorted. The infected skin was starting to grow across my toe nail. A week of antibiotics and I was back to normal... 

I was also never allowed to be sick. I always had to be well. When I broke my wrist first time I was very small, but because I don't swell or bruise when I break things people don't believe it (I've never had a broken bone treated). The only way I know is that lovely burning pain you get if you knock it after a day or so of it being broken. Me complaining about it hurting just ended with her telling me to shut up. Same when I broke it again as a teenager, I ended up wrapping it myself. Then my foot, that actually swelled and bruised, but it was barely anything. That hurt so bad to walk on but she refused to drive me to school after the first day or so. A 15/20 minute walk took an hour because I was in so much pain. It was never treated. I just had to deal with it.

Mum used to tell me their brains were sick and they couldn't remember the now. But they were remembering it, they were remembering their now. It made no sense though, as the blast happened in the mid 80s, so older ghosts shouldn't have been here, right?

I continued to search, to find answers. Another article popped up. I was getting good at this Google thing. 

Certain areas of great tragedy can become like a beacon to other spirits without them even realising, but the people coming to the beacon could be from any time period. The area can become like a way station between the living and the spirit world. One such was found in a child's bedroom closet. The house had been the scene of a tragedy five years before, with the previous owners dying in a house fire. The child was seeing and hearing the spirits entering his bedroom at all times of the day. Some refused to move on and resided in the child's home and the surrounding homes around them. The door to the other world was closed by a priest and the spirits eventually moved on. 

I wonder if they realised? I wonder if that's why we saw so many people arriving in a state and then just vanishing. Is that where some of my friends went? Because they were friends with me they realised they were dead and passed over? Other time periods though. I looked at my new friend. He might be dead and from the future. That would explain all this fancy stuff, or maybe because of the dead here, I was stuck in time, their time. I shook my head. It made no sense. 

I needed more answers but I couldn't ask my mum. She would get mad, making her mad, my stomach turned at the thought. There were areas I wasn't allowed to go to. It was time to go see what was going on. 

I took a deep breath and Googled the town again and looked. There were pictures from before the blast, it looked like it does today, but there were new buildings around some areas, like the one I was sitting in right now. Then I found pictures of the town after the blast. The fissures in the streets, the damaged buildings. It didn't look too bad, but in the pictures, I could see people lying on the ground, unmoving. People in cars. Right there in the street was that bike I knew all too well, the one that I saw nearly daily. Mr Fereks, it was him. That was his hat lying near his balding head. 

""Oh my god,"" I gasped. I kept scrolling, not really seeing anyone else, just him. Then there was another link at the bottom of the page. A link to a list of the dead. Did I dare click on it? I realised I was shaking badly. 

""Hey, what's wrong?"" my friend asked, sitting down next to me. 

""I, I saw someone I know, in the pictures,"" I pointed to the article. 

He looked at me curiously, ""probably someone who just looks similar.""

""There's a list, of the dead,"" I told him quietly. He starred at it as well, his face going pale. 

He knows, I thought, watching him carefully. He pressed the link and a new page came up. A list of everyone who died in the blast and their ages. 

I started scrolling through the names. Most meant nothing to me. I thought I reconised a few of the younger people, but I couldn't be sure. I paused, the list was in alphabetical order. I thought about the names of the people around me, forcing myself to remember them. I was awful with names, I could barely remember anyone's. Even the friend with me now, his name evaded me. The friend from when I was seven, I remembered his name. I looked him up. There he was. The girl my age up the street. She was there. That boy in my class who wouldn't leave me alone, same thing. Again and again the people I knew were on the list. I then held my breath and searched my mums maiden name. There, in writing were my relatives, two grandparents, my aunt, uncles, my cousins. The people mum forced myself to be around every single week were right there, on the list of the dead. I scrolled away quickly, unable to look at anymore names. 

I scrolled for what seemed like forever before I got to the bottom, unable to really read anymore. Another part was labelled, Deaths since the explosion. It seemed like right after some people died as they cleaned up the town, their cause of death was written right there. Some kids fell into a sinkhole exploring and then my blood ran cold. There was my mums name, it was right there. She was found dead the day we moved to this town, had crashed her car into a ditch near where her family had lived. I wasn't on the list though. There was another list, a list of the missing. People who were never found or who came here and never left. There I was. My name was right there. 

""You're there?"" my friend asked. 

I nodded. ""Missing. I'm just missing, not dead.""

""Your mum?""

""She's..."" I couldn't get the words out.

""Dead?"" I nodded and I burst into tears. My friend wrapped his arm around my shoulder. I cried hard. Everything was just so overwhelming. 

""It's ok,"" he spoke quietly.

He took his tablet from me as I calmed down. I watched as he opened a new tab and began to type. I realised it was his name. I watched silently as he clicked the top new article. There was his face, he was happy and smiling. He had died, had been murdered by his father in his bed as he slept. A bullet to the back of his head. I watched as he put his hand back then and pulled it away quickly, as if he had an electric shock. 

""What's happening?"" he asked me, fear on his face. ""We moved here last week, mum and me. 

""She's gone, hasn't she?"" I asked quietly. 

""No!"" he yelled, ""I saw her, no I saw her..."" he went quiet. They had both arrived here, but she moved on. She must have known she was dead. 

I heard it then. That weird rattle, the one I heard sometimes, the same one I heard before my last friend vanished. It sounded like wood hitting wood. It sent shivers up my spine. 

""I'm dead,"" he muttered, slumping back on the couch. I took the tablet from him again. He really was. It was all there in that article. A week ago his father had murdered him. ""What do I do now?"" he asked me sadly. 

I was shaking badly. I was so scared. But I remembered what I had read, ""Spirits get mad if they stay trapped here once they know the truth. You have to leave.""

""But, I can't. I'm scared.""

""You have to,"" I told him softly, tears forming in my eyes. He was the only friend I had right now. 

""I won't become angry, I won't!"" he yelled. I cowered as the entire roomed darkened like it did when my mum got mad. He suddenly shrunk back to normal in horror before he got up, seemingly knowing some truth all of a sudden. ""Keep the tablet,"" he told me, ""I'm going to meet my mum now.""

I watched him leave the house. The door clicked closed behind him and I was suddenly sitting on a hay bale in a farmers field, clutching a tablet in my arms. He was gone. I cried hard. Everyone and everything I knew was a lie. Everyone was dead, I was the only living person in this town. It all made sense now, why everyone hated me, why no one wanted to be my friend. I didn't fit in here because I wasn't dead. They were all scared, scared of the truth. Scared of what came next. My mum was angry because she knew she was dead, but she came back for me. 

I went home. I knew what I had to do. I went around my house, packing up the things I wanted to keep. Pictures, books, toys, even some VHS. I wrote a note to my mum, telling her I knew the truth and I left the house. Mum wasn't lying when she screamed at me that I had ruined her life. I had, although not her life, her death. With me gone, she could move on. She didn't have to be angry any longer. I looked at the tablet. The internet didn't work now my friend was gone. I stowed it in my backpack and carried on walking, using the old town map I had lying around my room. I followed the main road out into the countryside, people passed me as I left, but I didn't hear the chilling rattle and no one tried to stop me. Some waved to me as I left. I think they knew I was leaving. A few miles up the road, I came to a dead end. I looked back, the town was long out of view, only a lone farmhouse stood nearby. I knew once I stepped over the line, I wouldn't see them again. Somehow I just knew. I closed my eyes as tears formed. I took a deep breath and stepped over. It was a symbolic act, but I felt like I had just stepped over from the spirit world, into the real world. I didn't know what was going to happen to me now, I stumbled over rocks and fallen trees, but I knew I was finally going to be allowed to live a normal life."
WritingPrompts,ff904ym,t3_es6h9o,1579701436.0,"The town I live in is very backwards. An old farming town, located in a place so rural that we very rarely got visitors. New people moved in sometimes, but it very rarely happened. The new people were always so confused, so lost, but we weren't allowed to talk about that. 

I sat at home, watching the TV as new episodes of the Power Rangers aired. My mum never approved of me watching them. I always asked for toys from the show, but she never bought them. All my toys, they weren't the ones you'd see advertised on TV. I had old wooden spinning tops, I got them in a box that had been painted to look like Bayblades after I'd asked for some. I mostly had dolls and the odd toy gun. My dolls were all porcelain, with hair that I could have sworn was real, but mum always said it wasn't, but she took special care of them, making sure they were always so perfect. What I really wanted though were Power Rangers, or a video game console. I'd asked but nothing. I never saw them in the windows of the shops here. They were always full of stuff for sale, but when I went out they were never open. 

What I really found strange were the people. My neighbours had an old TV from the 50s in their livingroom. All their pictures were in black and white. Up the road, the girl my age, all her things were from the 80s, her music, her style. Everyone seemed to have a quirk like that. The more rural people would only use horses to get around, the townies used classic cars and old bikes mostly. Mum had a car, but it sat silently in our driveway most of the time. Sometimes she took it out, but very rarely. I hadn't been in it for a long time. On cold and wet days I'd beg to be driven to school, but mum would refuse, calling me lazy as she climbed inside and drove off, passing by my school on the way to work. 

School. I hated school. I loved to learn, but I never had a friend for long, no longer then six months before they'd get sick of me and would leave me. The weird part, I was never around the same kids for very long. Just one school year and I'd be with a new group who seemed to know everything about me, but I knew nothing about them. I used to tell mum about it, she took me to a doctor who then took me to a shrink. There was talks about putting me on medication, I heard electroshock at one point and decided to shut up about it. We didn't talk about the odd things we saw here. Like the lost man I'd met in full military uniform with blood running down his face, or the woman screaming in the middle of the town center on market day for her children, her white shirt drenched in red. 

Today though was a good day. Mum was at work and there was no school. I'd finally made a new friend, a boy a year or two older then me. I wasn't really allowed out of the house when she wasn't with me, but we were going to play video games at his. He was pretty new here and wasn't like the other kids. He knew what I was talking about when I mentioned the Power Rangers and other shows I watched on TV. He could talk about that new movie I watched last weekend. Finally, I wasn't just being weird, someone else knew what I was talking about. 

His place was on a street I'd never ventured down before. Actually, I don't think I'd ever heard of it until today. It was just up the road from me, jutting off to the left. I thought I would have cycled down it at some point, but no. I walked up to his house and knocked. He was at the door in an instant. I walked inside and everything was so different. The TV! It was huge and so small at the same time. 

""Woah! I thought these were only on TV!"" I spoke in shock. Under it were different boxes I didn't reconise. ""What are they?""

PS4, Switch, Blu Ray player and a Digibox. 

I looked at him confused. I'd never heard of them. It wasn't like these things were the focus of any TV show and the town was so backwards it never had things like this for sale. 

""Do you want to see what's online?"" He asked. 

""Online? Wait, like on a computer that's connected to the world?""

""You've never been online?""

I shook my head, ""I've never even seen a computer.""

He looked at me, surprised and instead of leading me to a machine, he pulled out a thin metal thing and handed it to me. I starred at it. We sat down and he explained to me it was a tablet and could do nearly anything a computer could do. Like go online. He opened something he called Chrome and handed it to me. There in the center of the screen was something called a Google Search Bar. I starred at it before touching it. A kind of typewriter showed up at the bottom of the screen. I could look for anything. I was about to search the Power Rangers when another thought stuck me. I instead searched for this town. 

""The most haunted place in the world, it's so haunted that the place was closed off by the local government right after the disaster after far too many accidents happened.""

""Woah, this place is haunted. But it's not closed off, mum and dad just moved us here.""

""What disaster?"" I asked quietly and opened something called Wikipedia and began to read. 

In the mid 80s, this town was populated by around 10,000 people. It was a farming community with one of the last remaining active mines under it. There is no information on the cause of the fire, it's speculated a lit cigarette or possibly a spark from a tool ignited gas in one of the lower chambers, causing the massive explosion. It ripped the town apart, those who weren't caught up in the blast, suffocated or died very quickly from exposure to a chemical that still hasn't been identified. The few survivors were either out of the town or had just been ultra lucky. 

When the town was deemed safe to enter, clean up began. The removal and burial of bodies started at the local high school where there had been no survivors. There was no formal burial. They had all been buried at the back of the schools field along with many people around. Clean up was shut down due to superstition of a curse and stories of weird things happening. 

""What the hell?"" I muttered. 

""Our field is full of bodies?!"" my friend asked horrified. 

I scrolled down to Superstition and opened up the rest of the article. 

On the August 23rd, the last of the bodies were removed from a farm house on Acres Lane and clean up could finally begin. It had been decided that due to the nature of the disaster, the town would be bulldozed so no one would get hurt again. The mine had been closed off and it's entrance sealed. When the machines rolled in, people started seeing and hearing weird things. One man said he saw a man, riding a horse. When they got to the schools, the grounds were full of kids, the same kids they had buried. The machines refused to move and the workers had run. People eventually refused to go anywhere near the town. The roads were eventually cut off, dug up to make getting there harder and the town was removed from the maps. It was theorized that there were still gases in the air, causing hallucinations, but nothing to explain why every bit of equipment would always stop working. 

""I don't get it. I've never heard about this. I grew up here and, nothing.""

""People write fake stuff all the time online, maybe that's how this town is getting their tourists.""

""Maybe,"" I muttered, but things were starting to make sense now. The town always felt, off. Everything always seemed stuck, like it was unmoving, the kids I knew, they were always the same, never changing. I always found it weird when I snuck a look at my old school photos and I always stood out from everyone else somehow. We were all dressed the same, all stood together in rows, made to stand where we had been placed, but no matter where I was, I stood out. I was just, different. 

We stayed looking at the tablet. I had now ventured into looking at ghosts and haunted places, but I avoided my hometown. Every time I saw an article about it, my heart sank and my stomach squirmed. 

Most spirits don't know they have passed over. If they died suddenly or violently they may linger on in a blissful ignorance, going about their daily lives. Those who know the truth and refuse to move on, can become sad, violent and malevolent. Lashing out, getting angrier over time. I shook in my seat. I remembered, before we moved here, that my mum, she hadn't been mean to me back then. She had been like the mothers you see on TV. Then something happened with dad. Mum packed us up and we left. She drove us here. I remembered that. She used a little road to get here, said we were going to visit her family. A family I'd never met before. We moved into our house. She said it was ours now. All our stuff was piled inside from the trailer attached to the car and she vanished. I was so scared. Then she just kind of, came back a day or so later. I remember wanting to hug her, but she was so cold, she pushed me away from her angrily and told me to stop being a baby, I was too big to be acting like that. From that day forwards, the town came to life. Suddenly there were people walking up and down the street. Old looking cars driving around, people on horses and yet, I never fit in. I was always different from the other kids. Every other new kid that arrived was instantly accepted, but not me. 

I looked at my new friend. He was now playing a game on his PS4, leaving me to read alone. They don't know they're dead. That kept replaying in my head. The town was always so backwards, no internet, no computers and no one knew what I was talking about when I talked about the movies and TV shows I watched. Then again, my new friend, his house was very different to mine, tech had moved on so much that I was floored by it. It was like I had traveled to the future. Was I dead? Had I just not noticed? I thought about it. No, I couldn't be. I aged. No one else did. My heart pounded in my chest. No one else around me aged. My frail old neighbours who gave me cookies, my best friend from when I was seven was still here, but he was still seven."

I couldn't hit my cousin or they'd hit me harder, I was barely holding him off and instead of helping me. Mum basically told me to let this kid assault me in that way.

AskReddit,fey992t,t3_equ586,1579442413.0,"Transfer the money to myself as a fee and then spend it however I want. I wouldn't change too much though. Most of it would go to charity to help save the planet, paying off debts, helping people who need help. I'd buy myself a house, nothing fancy, help my friends get their own places. I'd buy a car and travel a lot. 

Nothing too crazy. No kid would go hungry or be cold here in the UK, that's for sure."

CPTSD,fexzciq,t1_fexqmqp,1579438712.0,"Im sorry your relatives were so freaking awful. I was six when I snitched on my mum for something really bad she'd done to me. I was told to stop making up stories for attention. No one believed me and never did. I'd try and tell people and I'd always be called I liar, even by kids I was friends with. When you go through horrific things, your abuser tells you you deserve it, and everyone around you tell you you're lying, it seriously messes with you. I had people watch bad things happen to me, then those same people would tell me nothing happened..."
news,fextslf,t1_fexd6lk,1579436052.0,"Same rule at the girl guides. When I turned 16, suddenly I was a huge risk to be around the kids, some I'd grown up with. I had to be police cleared, then I was told I wasn't allowed to see or interact with any of the kids outside of the meetings. One, I was in some classes with one kid who wasn't 16 yet. Two, some of those kids I'd known for 10+ years because of other clubs. Three, I was friends with a couple of the younger kids and suddenly it wasn't allowed. I told them the rule was bullcrap, that I went to the same school as a lot of the girls (I was year 11, there were two high schools and if the kid was 11 they were most likely in my school) and I wasn't going to stop talking to them. I understood the rules were there to keep kids safe and I was careful with them, but suddenly becoming a threat to the kids once I turned 16 was scary, especially when some of the kids were in my classes in school."
AnimalsBeingBros,fevwppy,t1_fev9jgf,1579402409.0,My dog loved chewing bottles. There's no harm in letting them grab a bottle on the walk as long as you don't stop long enough for them to rip the kid off. Food containers were a big no but bottles were always ok.
AnimalsBeingBros,fevwf6n,t3_eqlnzu,1579402289.0,My husky would hunt for a bottle every night. If she found more then one she'd test both the choose the one she liked best to chew on the walk home. It was adorable and she learned to chew the hell out of them before we went inside because they weren't allowed in the house (I didn't want her to accidentally eat part of it). I'd help her find bottles as well as allowing her to eat chips if I saw them in the floor so she always got excited when I pointed things out.

It was just a game and we were all laughing. They get me back there and suddenly I  wasn't there, I was behind them.

Weirdly, in my mums house I hated mirrors, but I'm ok with them here and in my boyfriends house and he has a massive one at the bottom of his bed. Nothing scary about it."
AskReddit,fevd9vz,t1_fetrjej,1579396037.0,"So, when my nan died she decided to come visit me and scare the crap out of me. I felt how she felt, scared, lost, terrified of being cremated and couldn't find my grandad. Well it turns out she was cremated and her body was lost between two hospitals and my grandad couldn't find her. The weird part, I went back to sleep after and she was in a room full of other old people. One of my cousins was there. We looked at each other and said she didnt know she was dead... the creepiest part. I hadn't seen her in over two years. I was able to describe exactly how she had looked down to the haircut and dark rings under her eyes. 

When my grandad died, my next door neighbour asked my mum why she was home early. He went white as a sheet and told my mum his car had been parked out front earlier. The car was still parked outside his house two towns over. Luckily he died in the daytime, so no crazy dream visits for me or anyone else that time."
AskReddit,fevasqn,t1_festeo5,1579395233.0,"So every time I've moved into a new place, random things have vanished. One time in my final year accommodation at uni it was my house keys. Not good as I couldn't leave my house without them. I knew they were either on my desk or bed, I checked my entire house, all the empty rooms and couldn't find them anywhere. In frustration I asked for my keys back and suddenly they were in the middle of my bedroom floor. I was stunned. I then told whatever it was that I didnt mind it hanging around as long as it left my stuff alone. It did. Moved into my next place, same thing. Had to ask it to stop to keep track of my stuff. 

When I was a little kid and we moved, it was this big black dog teddy that went missing. Never did get it back. Some of mums stuff vanished as well. No idea what happened there. Mum always commented on it because it was so weird and she knew they were packed up, but not together. The dog should have been in the box with my other teddies."
