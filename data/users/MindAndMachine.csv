Harm reduction starts with educating everyone on the risks and rewards of each drug/way of using.  Not by building an app for addicts to find restrooms.  I think these days shooting up in an alley or under a tree somewhere shouldn't be that hard..."

I still smoke these days, but way less often and in much more ""normal"" function.  For me, i went to 30 day inpatient unexpectedly, parents showed up at my house and just took me there that day.  I'd say go especially if youre this worried about it yourself.  I wasnt worried, but thankfully my parents were since theyd seen me slipping in school and jobs.
