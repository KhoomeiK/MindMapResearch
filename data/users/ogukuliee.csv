creepyencounters,feoraxx,t3_eq5vay,1579304385.0,"It was pretty scary.. Thinking that this man were in the zone close to your house, or even a little bit further, maybe every night.. Man, I wouldn't want that to happen to me"

It's just fear. It'll pass, or not, but the most important is the reality :)"

depression,femgcyv,t3_eps4y5,1579254093.0,"You know, it's always better to love yourself, even a little, before loving anyone else..

And maybe you got something, maybe ""loving"" your depression in a way can help you get better. Cause that's a part of you."

DreamInterpretation,fekmsx5,t1_fekk1z0,1579203310.0,Maybe I wrote it wrong. I meant it would have been better if these kinds of scenes only happened in our nightmares.
LetsNotMeet,fekm6cl,t3_epbyn0,1579202938.0,"I don't think that guy knew his actions were bad..

Maybe he has/had [a loss of contact with reality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis), and he built a sort of ""mental realm"" constitued of [delusions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusion) about you two. And maybe all that built his [obsession](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive_love) for you. (I am not trying to excuse his behaviour, but that could be an explanation. If [his diagnosis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) is real there's a probality.)"

mentalhealth,fedn09d,t1_feakisy,1579015484.0,"Thank you very much for your comment and your time. 

I'm used to write poetry, so I kinda know what you're saying about the journal. (I write since 2015). I write in a very personal way. (I do not post anywhere what I write) I even held a journal when I was interned in psychiatry. 

About the pills, I've been taken 'em for 2 years now. And I know for a fact that it's not a magical thing. But, without them, I would be worse.. There's a lot of psychiatrists who are like ""Pills dispensers"" (not mine fortunately), but in my case that's something that I don't want, yet, to disappear from my life. Since I have a Mood disorder (bipolarity in my case, plus the depression), my meds are for me a way to be ""normalized"".
Thus, I don't know if someday I could be, let's say ""normal"" (I don't feel abnormal, I mean by that ""with a stable mood"") without meds.

The meditation seems cool, maybe I'll do it one day.

And where I'm stuck, is that I have good feelings about myself. I find myself strong, kind, even beautiful sometimes. But I continue to feel like shit.. There's a contradiction in my mind. And I don't recognize yet where's the problem. (While I've known myself for a long time and i've been working on myself)"

Or

Some comparative sites with multiple cameras. (I use myself some sites like that) 
If you're not sure about that you can always approach the police or some security companies to have real advice. (sorry if I my answer doesn't help much)"

LetsNotMeet,fe6ok08,t3_enwkua,1578898261.0,"What a bitch, it happened to me too, sort of. And in France the teachers can't be fired, just transfered to another school (except in some extreme cases, like pedophilia, when there's proof). Sooo, I feel you"
LetsNotMeet,fe6o1x2,t3_enwljt,1578897678.0,"Hide motion sensors cameras around your apartment/garage, like nanny cams or some things like that. It can really help you to know if there's an intruder by keeping some images of him/her (if the stalker is real and you can see his face on the images, you'll have proof for the police)

Ps: I almost forgot, even with the Facebook story, there's a possibility that it's just your landlord using your things when you're not there. That can be a lead, it happens too much (and that's illegal)"

mentalhealth,fe5n4kl,t3_enqq2c,1578871585.0,"Therapy, nothing else. You're not the only who can have those sorts of ""pulsions"" or ""thoughts"". Sometimes I can have some similar, not entirely similar, but thinking and doing are not the same things, if those thoughts are repulsive to you that can be a good sign. And if you're afraid that you are a psychopath, tell yourself that a psychopath is not afraid to think those kinds of things, and is not even a little bit ashamed."
