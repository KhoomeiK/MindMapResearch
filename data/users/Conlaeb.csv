politics,fdnaspu,t1_fdlg0ky,1578581738.0,He appears to be arguing that it's better for a nation to provide basic sustenance than to allow its' poor to starve to death.  In what way exactly do you disagree?
mountandblade,fdlw39d,t1_fdlw0y4,1578533902.0,Nooo shit.  Not sure if I have Floris installed and working now but you are making me real curious.  Thank you for the insight!

To my knowledge you can only release or ransom them when given the opportunity.  Most likely you will just curse under your breath when they escape tho."

todayilearned,fdltuzp,t1_fdlpy1u,1578532363.0,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy
It was a lot more than just LA.  Though National City lines managed to beat the charge of conspiracy to monopolize the transit industry, they were convicted of conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce in other ways.  Can you imagine a business cabal actually getting charged and convicted of such things today?"

HistoryMemes,fdaayxy,t1_fda8i25,1578243904.0,"I can't think of an instance where Pompey stole Crassus' thunder during the Sullan/Marian fighting, but I have heard that since his exploits were against other Romans they didn't really ""count"" in terms of prestige.  Similar to his victories in the 3rd servile war, although in that case there is also the famous story of Pompey stealing his thunder at the very end."

politics,fcu66jy,t1_fcu1d39,1577973513.0,"Without active policies like what Bernie is calling for, profits will absolutely be going into the hands of already established industry players.  My state (Michigan) has legalized recreational cannabis, but the legislation doing so created regulatory hurdles so high it costs over $100k to establish as much as a company to transport cannabis from farms to labs to distributors.  Not going to be a lot of bootstraps here, just existing money getting richer."

whatisthisthing,fcgi24z,t1_fcgesug,1577640263.0,"I am no expert but I may be able to help.  The Piezoelectric effect describes certain materials that, when flexed, generate a small electrical current.  Generally those same materials respond to a small electric current by stiffening (the opposite of flexing.)  Essentially, these skis are storing the small amount of power generated by the skis flexing, and then using that power to stiffen them at certain times.  Piezoelectrics are also used in things like guitar pickups.  In that case the audio waves stress and flex the piezoelectric component, which has wires attached taking the corresponding electrical signal generated by the audio waves and sending it to an amplifier.  With these skis the corresponding electrical signal is being stored instead of sent to another system, and then sent right back into the piezoelectrics when needed."
politics,fcgcx86,t1_fcg7w7z,1577638744.0,I am curious which of the rules that article broke.  Referring to white people and referencing polls that specifically break data down by race is not the same as inflammatory race baiting is it?
