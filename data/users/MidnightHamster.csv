mentalhealth,fe6s44h,t1_fe5dk8s,1578902792.0,"Interesting article to read - https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/17/assisted-dying-euthanasia-netherlands 

The lady was 29-year-old. 

“For not only was Brouwers young, she did not have a terminal disease such as cancer. She suffered from psychiatric illnesses, including severe anxiety, depression, eating disorders and psychosis. She self-harmed and had attempted suicide numerous times. She had spent nearly three years as an inpatient at a psychiatric hospital, and had served time in prison for arson.”

Also in there:

“The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg all have permissive laws on assisted dying and voluntary euthanasia, based on applicants’ suffering, and restricted to citizens of those countries. Switzerland allows assisted dying on compassionate grounds, and some clinics there, such as Dignitas, accept people who are not Swiss residents.”"

However it isn’t like you turn up and tell them you want to die and they will do it for you straightaway. You have to go through the process and treatment to ensure that this is truly the last option. To make sure that the mental illness that you have is definitely “terminal” just like the criteria for the assisted suicide for physical illnesses."

I think this might be a good opportunity to reflect on your life before having a conversation with your parents."
mentalhealth,fdqqkth,t1_fdqk0js,1578672755.0,"It’s complex, not just weird. 

Imagine this, you start questioning / advising / criticising his actions (albeit all the good intentions), how would it look like from a perspective of someone with a low self-esteem issue? Perhaps something like...oh of course I’m always wrong, I’m never good enough, I’m not loved anymore, isn’t love supposed to be unconditional, etc. This is especially that you mentioned “emotionally abused by a parent” so I assume there might also be an element of abandonment issue there. 

I mean it depends on the dynamic and strength of your relationship. No one can predicts the outcome really but it is a possibility. 

The extreme defensive mechanism usually comes up because of an unstable foundation. Once he has a solid foundation within him, these symptoms will dissipate by themselves. Each person’s needs are different but if you really want to know more, you can google “Maslow’s hierarchy of needs”. 

As a partner, I imagine you would come in as someone to provide that “love and sense of belonging” that he may never have from his family. However, if you are trying to do all the actions to help him, but it makes him feel less loved, then it totally defeats the purpose and helping with the core of the problem. 

Approach him from the perspective of I love you for who you are. I like this quote I heard once: “Love despite, like because”. 

Take it slow. This is something that will take years, not months or weeks. If you can be his safe zone, he will come to you and listen to you naturally because he knows he will still be loved no matter what.

mentalhealth,fdqjpq7,t3_emqv5i,1578668335.0,"Without knowing his life story it is hard to tell. However I would highly recommend for you not to act as his therapist, unless you have appropriate training, and even then you’re still too close in relationship with him. 

If the roots are deep, they need to be unpacked properly by trained professionals. Then you can support him through his journey. 

Of course there are things you could do to try make him aware of his actions but if the causes are something deep, he isn’t going to realise it or if he realises it he might hate himself for his life growing up and how he become (sadness/anger/etc). 

If you’re going to open the pandora box, know what you’re doing and be sure to see it through to the end."

Consider it from the other perspective. Can you identify anyone who has this group of similar characteristics but do not have Down Syndrome? 

There are other genetic conditions which affect facial features, for example Prader-Willi syndrome, Williams syndrome, etc. We look at those features and notice that they are different but we don’t associate them with Down Syndrome."

askscience,fclb5ij,t1_fcku1c3,1577743774.0,"I doubt it’s purely due to that. There are common physical signs of Down Syndrome such as:

- Decreased or poor muscle tone
- Short neck, with excess skin at the back of the neck
- Flattened facial profile and nose
- Small head, ears, and mouth
- Upward slanting eyes, often with a skin fold that comes out from the upper eyelid and covers the inner corner of the eye
- White spots on the colored part of the eye (called Brushfield spots)
- Wide, short hands with short fingers
- A single, deep, crease across the palm of the hand
- A deep groove between the first and second toes

I see your mum’s point really. Also depends on where you live in the world, the kid might get “teased” in school for having a weird name. 

You are not wrong to name your son with a name that you and your husband agreed on but from what you said it wasn’t because of the bet really, it’s more because you both love the name. So I’d suggest you shape the story differently like it was a name of a friend you were once very close to etc. It’s still the truth."
