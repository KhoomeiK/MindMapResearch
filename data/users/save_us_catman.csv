worldnews,fefrr1p,t3_eoq7jt,1579063271.0,I was literally just thinking last night in bed about the guy that uploaded the video.  This was kind of my thought process of how it would go to. Such a shame and I can almost guarantee the person who filmed it had no idea what it was going to cost him.  I hope he comes out alive.

DogCare,febim5r,t3_eoa8nz,1578959232.0,Get the pup into a training class asap.  I have a heeler mix and this was HUGE for his growth.  Not only does he get to see other dogs and people but it teaches them to watch you when there are a bunch of other things going on.  I would highly recommend doing at least a beginner class at the very least.  it will help both you and him set limits.

Harrisburg,feazooc,t1_fe6a7kt,1578953932.0,Only thing is prop. taxes if someone is looking to buy. If you are just renting I don't know if that translates to the rent but just an FYI.  I was looking at houses one literally right on the Harrisburg line had double the taxes that any surrounding area did.
