bulletjournal,ffgxgn8,t1_ffgx9aa,1579917565.0,Thank you!
bulletjournal,ffgumfv,t3_etj292,1579915477.0,"Wow, this is amazing! So much I love about it! Good job!"
bulletjournal,ffgtufn,t1_ffgjlfw,1579914909.0,Thank you!
bulletjournal,ffgtp80,t1_ffgl80y,1579914803.0,"Yup, that is the blackout journal I'm using!"
bulletjournal,ffgtkq3,t1_ffglbv4,1579914712.0,Close! I decided to use white paper for the triangle for a cleaner look. Gel pen was my first idea though.
bulletjournal,ffgte8t,t1_ffgp1id,1579914579.0,Thank you! This is a blackout journal from Archer & Olive.
bulletjournal,ffgt9nv,t1_ffgjqdd,1579914487.0,"Sorry for the late response! Everyone saying that the pages are black are correct. The triangle is white paper that I glued on for the ""inverted"" effect."
bulletjournal,ffgez6u,t1_ffgebbb,1579904740.0,Thanks!!
bulletjournal,ffgby8v,t1_ffg6u0z,1579902860.0,Thank you!
bulletjournal,fffxjzc,t1_fffx5vr,1579893987.0,"Thanks so much! Full disclosure though, the hands were mostly traced. I don't trust myself to go for a drawing like that and not ruin my cover page, haha!"
bulletjournal,fffwjsd,t3_etf1ut,1579893361.0,I didn't write the year for my blackout journal because I'm planning to primarily use it for art and not limit it to a certain year. :)
bulletjournal,ffdgllj,t1_ffdgg4w,1579820433.0,"So glad I helped! It really is a lovely cover, I just wish they made it in more colors."
bulletjournal,ffdg9gl,t3_et0wu6,1579820240.0,Archer & Olive has a journal with a bee on the cover. You might be thinking of that.
bulletjournal,ff33qm8,t1_ff2tjha,1579532912.0,"Thank you for this info, I really appreciate it! I'm surprised by the New Year / Lunar New Year distinction here. There seem to be a number of people who celebrate the Lunar New Year in the area, and with the design I assumed it was! Still very cool. I found it in a Japanese stationery store in  Honolulu."
bulletjournal,ff28edn,t1_ff285ph,1579496806.0,"Yup, thanks! I like to keep a short ruler in the back pocket."
bulletjournal,ff27458,t1_ff23ur4,1579495705.0,"Thanks! Right now I just have another small item I'd like to stick into my journal at some point,  but I'd like to find another use for it!"
bulletjournal,ff1suow,t3_eqzfga,1579485416.0,Beautifully done!
bulletjournal,few109v,t3_eql2dv,1579403938.0,This is gorgeous!
bulletjournal,fekzjng,t1_feklirz,1579210867.0,I think this looks perfect!
bulletjournal,feffibd,t3_eovt11,1579055237.0,This whole page is so nice to look at!
bulletjournal,fef505p,t3_eoudd0,1579048320.0,"The page on the left will be a simple log of the savings account.

The page on the right is to show net changes in the balance per month. The first line on the top left side will show the amount in the account at start of the year. The amount in the account at the end of this month will be written next, which carries over to the starting amount for February, and so on. The lines on the right side will simply show a net gain or loss from the start to the end of each month."
bulletjournal,fecsfqz,t1_fecs4hv,1578982854.0,"I haven't but I will certainly check it out, thanks!"
bulletjournal,fecoagp,t1_fecnb5n,1578978976.0,"You might be right. I've tried quite a few pens now that I see recommended often but if I had to pick one pen to stick to, I'd choose Tul for sure."
bulletjournal,fecmyqb,t1_fecmqz0,1578977936.0,"They really are amazing pens! Surprisingly, I've never seen them mentioned here."
bulletjournal,fech8kq,t3_eofs9s,1578973864.0,"I'm quite proud of this spread even though my reading list came out sloppy!

There are 12 books on the shelf as my goal is to read at least 12 books this year (1 per month). I've left space to add books on top in case I go over!

I'm also excited for my reading list even though a few will be re-reads :)"
bulletjournal,feasewh,t3_eo5yar,1578951842.0,"Maybe for months that you have a bit more extra time on your hands you can do birds or insects. I am wanting to make an artistic bird watching log where I draw the species of birds I've seen since I moved to O'ahu. I'm not confident in my artistic ability to make it and not be disappointed by the result though, but your style is exactly how I envision it. So beautiful!"
bulletjournal,fdp5lyc,t1_fdp3v62,1578620541.0,"Thank you so much for all these suggestions, I will definitely be checking them out! Also, my husband's family are Spanish speakers so when I'm ready to try conversations I can start there! :)"
bulletjournal,fdosief,t1_fdos7dr,1578611895.0,"Great idea! I'm also thinking I'll try watching shows or movies with Spanish subtitles on, then swapping to Spanish shows or movies with English subtitles on."
bulletjournal,fdorymy,t1_fdordx1,1578611553.0,"Thanks! The first set of lessons were really easy and basic stuff. Then I took the checkpoint quiz and they threw words at me that I have never seen and I had to use context for most of the answers. I went from ""I got this"" through the lessons to ""Oh, okay then"" at the checkpoint. High school Spanish class really didn't do much for me haha!"
bulletjournal,fdojh9a,t1_fdojdn7,1578606393.0,"Yes, that's what I was thinking too since they will only be filled in when they are maxed out. Thanks!"
bulletjournal,fdoinwp,t3_emgf5k,1578605921.0,I've already maxed out my first set of lessons and completed the first checkpoint but I can't decide if I want to fill the circles in with black pen or gold gel pen.
bulletjournal,fdiy51b,t1_fdivu0w,1578453710.0,Haha! Slow down there! We are still closer to 2019 than February.
bulletjournal,fdivmjw,t1_fdivgxe,1578452052.0,"I know how you feel, I spot nicer looking versions of things I just completed all the time.

Also, we're only a week in, you're not too late!"
bulletjournal,fdiuag0,t1_fdiu3f3,1578451190.0,Thank you!
bulletjournal,fdite26,t3_elln3g,1578450615.0,Archer and Olive notebooks sound like what you are looking for!
bulletjournal,fdim21f,t1_fdilqva,1578445923.0,"I stuck new paper over the top of the previous drawing in the middle. It's surprisingly unnoticeable in person too, just a difference in texture in the circle compared to the rest of the page. :)"
bulletjournal,fdih245,t3_el01hu,1578442743.0,I ended up sticking a new design over the top of the circle. Thanks for the suggestions guys!
bulletjournal,fdfyk29,t1_fdfvtvt,1578373841.0,I'm more inclined to stick something over the top of it than to draw over. I don't want to put anymore black ink in the circle than I already have so it won't bleed over to the next page.
bulletjournal,fdfoq8f,t1_fdflig6,1578366591.0,"Thank you, I might do that."
bulletjournal,fdf14cf,t3_el01hu,1578350941.0,"Any suggestions for covering the center with something else are welcome. The more I look at this, the more I hate it haha!"
bulletjournal,fcvujw8,t1_fcvu9ud,1578010425.0,Thanks! I stared at the page for a while when I realized I would need to draw 366 little circles for my vision of this page but I think it was worth it!
bulletjournal,fcjia2f,t3_ehikok,1577688639.0,"The following pages will be used to track vet appointments, weight, meds, etc."
bulletjournal,fc8wwv9,t1_fc85s3s,1577543368.0,"Thank you! The calendar page is actually inspired by one I found on Instagram by @leelajournals. Mine is altered to include numbers for the months, but hers is very nice to look at, you should check it out! I truly wish I stumbled upon her before making my grid spacing guide, because hers looks so clean!"
bulletjournal,fc6r219,t1_fc6qwq2,1577487305.0,Thank you!
AskReddit,f9hpjve,t1_f9g34f0,1575319223.0,"I've gone through several full sticks of chapstick/lip balm this way. My only problem is that my car chapsticks eventually melt a bit in the tube from sitting in the heat. I've reverted to just using my purse chapstick, but it's not at all ideal to have to get something out of a bag while driving."
