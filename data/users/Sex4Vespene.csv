I mean come on, this is clearly against the rules, which is why he was carded. What a fucking pussy, trying to cheat the game on technicalities. Anybody who looks up to that type of behavior is a loser."

Ok I take it back, I will give one reply. What in the fuck are you even saying here?"
WTF,fe3gbej,t1_fe3ewgy,1578849037.0,"There is so much retarded shit in your reply to unpack, I don't even think I have the interest in going through it all. First, painting a building is not even close to the same as breaking all their shit and stealing everything, retard. Second, this isn't fucking over low level employees, it probably isn't even them cleaning it up in the first place, they likely have to hire professionals (which the man in charge has to pay for, thus he will know about it. Even if the employees do have to clean it, they legally have to be paid for it, so if their job is shit and pays poorly, well then you've just created more hours of work for them, helping them make more money that they probably needed. Graffiti doesn't discourage business investment nearly as much as theft/vandalism, and to try and even make that argument is inherently retarded. Reply whatever you want, I don't really give a fuck and won't be replying back."
WTF,fe336db,t1_fe32hlf,1578845486.0,"How about you spend half the time replying to comments, to just look shit up yourself? Here is an example for electric transformer boxes: https://www.timescall.com/2019/04/12/johnnie-st-vrain-what-protects-shock-art-paint-on-transformer-boxes/

Have another annoying nit picky reply to that too?

Edit: why the fuck did people downvote this, yet upvote my first comment, when both of them are giving information to support the same thing. Some of y’all are retards."
WTF,fe3090c,t1_fe1yuga,1578844723.0,"I hadn’t even considered Europe as much. In the US, so much of our architecture is new, looks boring, and has absolutely no history, so to graffiti them can often be a step up, or at worst not the biggest deal. In Europe, these guys are literally destroying cultural markers."

If you want to paint the building of a huge company, go ahead, because those rich fuckers are probably cheating the system in some way anyway."
aww,fe00fhf,t1_fdzxk9r,1578800086.0,Just a bit more... rapey.
