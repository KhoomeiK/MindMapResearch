If you can, try really hard to almost take on a different persona. It takes a little bit to learn but if you talk with groups when you don't want to, force yourself out of your comfort zone, take charge when you doubt yourself but you force yourself to you will get better at it and soon enough you'll look like the real deal!"

Sounds like an addiction to me buddy, I think you should try to slowly reduce the amount of coffee you consume, saving it for particular times (such as the morning) helps some, and see how the reduced amount affects you over the moderate term. 

Say try reduce the amount and stick to that for 2 weeks, if you feel better in 2 weeks then keep at that, otherwise a rethought of strategy or further reduction in caffeine consumption may be required."

Ask him to hang out, movies, outdoor thing, some indoor activity whatever just something fun just you two and tell him you like him. Ask if he wants to go out. :)

I dunno, I still appreciate that I can acquire fresh coffee at all and have the choice of brewing it right after roasting or later.

I'll try a fresh roast and a week old roast to compare soon, thanks for the tip!"
Coffee,fdrgu12,t1_fdr1t1k,1578684344.0,"It's still pricier than anything you'd find in a supermarket over here. I've seen boutique roasters and such which also sell coffee at about the $18 p/lb Mark but I cannot afford it.

I'm not a professional batista or some coffee scientist but I have enjoyed coffee for years and tried a lot of brands, regions of bean and roast intensities, my local roasters is the best coffee I have personally found. They use a mix of Guatemalan and Costa Rican beans at a medium roast, it's a full bodied flavour with a caramel overtone and pleasantly bitter undertone.

While fresh doesn't mean a good quality coffee it certainly seems to help!"

Coffee,fcwo1uf,t1_fcwn4pr,1578031222.0,"Looked into it just now, from what I can see it's a bit of a mixed bag. Some are glorified pepper Mills and some seem to have proper ceramic burrs.
