Secretary of State Pompeo: We'll stop them.

Ambush journalism is fair game. But NPR has a reputation for neutrality. An exceedingly rare quality in the press these days. Rare enough to be sad about its near extinction when one of the last one dies. Government officials feel they can get treated fairly on NPR instead of being interviewed by someone that wishes to do them harm. 

National Public Radio is supposed to be better than CNN or FOX. 

Now her guest list will be just like CNN's. Liberals that will feel safe and conservatives will rarely show up and when they do it won't be a friendly NPR interview filled with candor and respect.

 It's all right there. She tried to force the discussion that she brought on abruptly with no warning. She opened that discussion  with an ambush question that assumed guilt and  had no pretext. 

When the Secretary of State objected with: 

Pompeo: ""You know, I agreed to come on your show today to talk about Iran. That's what I intend to do.""

as if  a Secretary of State doesn't deserve the respect of assuming there was a miscommunication. In fact she had that answer ready pretty quick.

**These are innocent people  being targeted by a politician**. 

This a group of innocent people that she's attacking in the press. This is not an individual with a moral compass. This is not an individual that can defend themselves. 

What this politician is doing is using an ancient tool of manipulation. **Hatred**

This tool has been used by politicians many times in the past to **make you a slave of envy**. So as to de-humanize the subject of her attacks. To instill in your mind the idea that you've been wronged and that the politician  should be handed power  to carry out justice in your name. To hand out the judgments that match the crimes that she so successfully prosecuted in your name. 

In other words the 500 or so billionaires that we have in the United States are going to be destroyed in your name. 

After they're destroyed you will not receive a billion dollars in compensation. The assets that were seized from those 500 or so billionaires was nothing in the bigger picture. None of it was in something you could use or something that benefited everyone. His yacht was not useful for anything but which it was designed. His Ferrari is more art than utilitarian with no more billionaires to purchase it. The assets it seems were tied up in the dynamo of his wealth creation and once removed that dynamo slowed to a halt. The wealth that was taken from those 500 billionaires is gone. It didn't pay for any of the promises the Socialists made.   You will not receive anything. Your prize will be a Social state. A state ruled by Democratic Socialists.  The Socialists that convinced you to give them power because of what those 500 billionaires did to you. Those Socialists will proceed to do what all Socialists do. Seize control of the economy and suppress private ownership. To destroy Capitalism and replace it with a Socialist system. Those things are literally a fundamental basic foundation of their ideology. A Democratic Socialist is a type of Socialist. Just because the word *Democratic* is in their name doesn't mean the second word ""Socialist"" disappears or changes or becomes diminished in any way. They still intend to destroy Capitalism and replace it with a Socialist system.

> Democratic socialists believe the fundamental issues with capitalism are systemic in nature and can only be resolved by replacing the capitalist economic system with socialism, i.e. by replacing private ownership with collective ownership of the means of production and extending democracy to the economic sphere.[3][27][38]

Like all Socialists they seize the business for the Socialist government and then suppress competition i.e. ""the people"". Individuals. You.  That's what it means when they say replace ""private ownership"" with ""collective ownership"". There is no more Ford or Chevy. There are no more  multiple car companies competing for your dollar with new technology and innovation. Just the government car company. You will not be allowed to open a competing company no matter how bad the products the government factory starts to produce. The factory that now works under minimal government standards. The factory that has no competition. The factory that has no compelling reason to put out quality products or pursue new technology and innovations.  

When Democratic Socialist  Ocasio-Cortez said she's  going to get rid of airplanes and build a government train to replace them **she meant it**. She's not joking around. She's a Socialist. All of our nations airlines are not going to simply stop doing business so a single government train can take over. Those airlines are going to be destroyed by Socialist policy. Trains are not going to offer better services than a plane in many many situations. The airlines won't be destroyed because the trains will make them obsolete. They will be destroyed because Socialists ban private ownership. Transportation will be under a government monopoly. 

There will no longer be multiple companies operating different business models. Successful business will not thrive and compete with foreign business. Bad business will no longer be destroyed by the free market forces of supply and demand. 

This is how Socialists always destroy the diversity of their own economy. 

This why there are no successful Socialist countries. None. Zero. Zilch. Nada. 

I'm about to get into conversations with people who have been misled. They will make the following false claims;


Ocasio-Cortez is not a Socialist.

Democratic Socialists are not Socialists.

Ocasio-Cortez is a Capitalist.

Europe is Socialist.

The Nordic countries are Socialist.

Denmark is a Socialist state.

Canada is a Socialist state.

A Democratic Socialist and a Social Democrat are the same thing.

Paying for a tax funded service like the police is Socialist.

Paying for  tax funded healthcare is Socialist.

Ocasio-Cortez does not want a government train. 

Ocasio-Cortez does not want to get rid of airplanes. 

These claims are predictable because they're scripted. They come from political propaganda. They come from subs that put out continuous confirmation bias as they build a Socialist *cult of personality* around Ocasio-Cortez. The folks at  75 Maiden Lane, Ste 702
New York City bring you this political propaganda because  Ocasio-Cortez is a card carrying member of the DSA. They do these things for the purpose of carrying out their Socialist agenda.

So when a Socialist attacks 500 of your fellow citizens **YOU BETTER BEWARE**. That Socialist is not concerned with those 500 people. Those 500 people are just an avenue to power that's paved with hatred and envy.
