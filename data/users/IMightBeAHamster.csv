His home dimension was not like ours, or vivzie's hell."

HazbinHotel,ffjgys7,t1_ffj7im1,1579998026.0,"Well, that's too general. There are many different types of overpowered antagonist. Bill Cipher is a perfect representative of the Childlike God, someone with huge power but doesn't have a reason to use it for any purpose other than fun, and who gets angry when confronted by something beyond their limits.

Childlike Gods however aren't always villains, The Doctor in S4 E17, The Waters of Mars, was one such character. Showing his childlike mentality here: [https://youtu.be/6sUz5PbbIzk](https://youtu.be/6sUz5PbbIzk)

Alastor, despite his calm collected façade, is another childlike god. He lives for entertainment, and uses his power only to watch others suffer, something he finds amusing. The reason he is calm is because he is in control, he has yet to find a limit to his power. The show will definitely need to explore that aspect of his character, which I imagine being - instead of a physical limit - a mental limit. He will, only after realising that he has developed feelings for his fellow Hotel-workers, falter and lose sight of his fascination with pain. This is my argument for why he would both betray, but also become redeemed."
