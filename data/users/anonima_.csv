IAmA,ff50gz1,t1_ff4toay,1579576930.0,"The EpiPen isn't a magic wand for allergic reactions. It's usually enough to keep your airway open for about 15 minutes. After this time you may have already recovered enough to be okay, or you might need another injection of epinephrine. You should call 911 immediately after using an EpiPen.

In my wilderness medicine class, we were taught this procedure for treating a life-threatening allergic reaction. I imagine much of this would apply on a plane, where you don't have access to hospital equipment:

1. Administer epinephrine (the active ingredient in an epipen)
2. As soon as the patient is calm enough to swallow, give Prednisone (a prescription steroid) if possible, otherwise give Benadryl 
3. Call/radio for help if possible. Follow their instructions. If you can't contact anyone but are within a day's travel from civilization, start evacuation immediately. 
4. Administer additional epinephrine shots as needed.

If you have super sensitive, life-threatening allergies, then you should have 2 epipens and a prednisone prescription for situations like plane rides and backcountry trips."
