MonsterHunterWorld,fgrd5lr,t1_fgr9dyj,1581043912.0,">You couldn't be more wrong. AVX does not increase your voltage at all. It does increase power consumption but increase current usage not voltage, voltage actually decrease. 

It's literally in Intel's white papers of AVX2.

>Intel AVX is designed to achieve higher throughput for certain integer and floating-point operations. Using these instructions may cause processors to operate at less than the marked TDP frequency. These reductions in frequency occur because high-power Intel AVX instructions require additional voltage and electrical current.

I'm just going to stop responding. It's not worth wasting my time with someone that's had multiple people say that your temps aren't right. The 3800x on the stock wraith cooler hits 73c on 95prime full load."
MonsterHunterWorld,fgr5ov3,t1_fgr4dac,1581038781.0,">And you just demonstrated that you have no clue how CPU work. Their temperature is not always relate at the percentage usage. 

Yes, we're talking about NORMAL usage, not torture tests. That should be painfully apparent because we're talking about your CPU playing a game, right?

>What causes MHW to increase temps at a higher rate than other games or applications? Their ""anti-cheat"" mechanism is constantly looking for unauthorized changes in memory, etc. That's doing lots of small operations per second which causes temperatures to increase significantly. Why would this affect other CPUs differently? Most likely it's using the CPU cache and the higher the cache the higher the impact will be.

Something like AVX/2 is specifically made to... Guess what? *Increase your voltage.* Which, as stated before.. Higher Voltage = Higher Temps.

**GASP!**

Notice how when you take away those smaller operations (By using CRC or SpecialK,) your usage drops? You're at 50% usage already. Those small threads are NOT causing your huge disparity in temps. Your temp does not correlate to your usage by any means, which definitely points towards a loop issue.

Comparing something like a torture test to normal game play to try and prove your point does not help your argument, it hurts it. The circumstances are so far apart it's insane to make that connection.

>This is not true in every case and so you know, my CPU power consumption is significantly higher than yours in a more dense area.

According to your AMD flair, you're running a 3800X. Lmfao. So, no, your power consumption is not significantly higher than mine. It's a few degrees, which a 2x 360 thermal loop should *easily* be cooling more."

What do you think MHW could possibly be doing to your CPU, that, while using the same amount of usage, would cause it to have a different temp?

That is the silliest claim ever. And if you knew anything about hardware, older 4C/8T CPUs *run hotter than new, lower wattage CPUs.*"

We got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match. Big results will come!"" (July 18, 2018)

""The man has very strong control over a country,"" he said. ""Now, it's a very different system and I don't happen to like the system, but certainly in that system, he's been a leader. Far more than our president has been a leader."" (September 7, 2016)

Yeah, absolutely no brown nosing. That's only taking the first result from a damn Google search. There's tons more. Also, good job ignoring the last paragraph."
dankmemes,ffqk4lk,t1_ffqhfvk,1580136788.0,"Yep. Really dangerous, which is why Trump just shakes hands and sucks up to those really dangerous people.

You're indoctrinated and brainwashed. It is not necessary. We aren't stopping dictators that are starving their people. We're barely able to stop terrorists. Barely.

We grossly overspend and grossly underperform. Should be the motto of our military. 

But don't worry. We'd rather care about overthrowing another regime based on made up facts than stopping people in our own country from going into endless poverty because they became sick. Great system we have going."
dankmemes,ffqfcxz,t1_ffqcw4b,1580132937.0,"Are you referring to the fake news being spread about the Green Deal? You're actually believing the words of Rick Scott? The Republican from Florida that defrauded Medicare?

You should actually read the document instead of listening to bullshit from a crooked Senator who literally scammed our government for billions.

The actual wording of the document just states a goal of reducing air traffic in favor of high speed trains. You know, like other countries are doing?

You should see Japan, Sweden, Germany, Spain, etc. There's a ton of countries going and promoting high speed trains.

None of them, including Bernie's plans, eliminate airlines. At all.

You're consuming fake news and regurgitating it."
dankmemes,ffqexqh,t1_ffqc2cg,1580132570.0,"Yes, because contrary to your beliefs, they aren't looking to start wars, as written in their Constitution. So of course they don't have an offensive military force. Lol. 

But they sure do have a DEFENSE military.

Maybe the US should stop playing world police?"

dankmemes,ffqbi4x,t1_ffqaz6w,1580129297.0,"So you are full of shit? We don't need to spend three times as much as the next nation to be 'safe'.

Hell, we do that and we even had terrorist attacks on our own soil. But yeah, we can't afford Universal healthcare (Which would be cheaper than paying what we already are per capita..) or public college (Which would reduce debt, increase wages, and boost the economy..) but let's go afford another trillion dollar war based on false information."
dankmemes,ffqaxwg,t1_ffqambw,1580128709.0,"Oh, so you have close personal relationships with the leaders of the worlds terrorist organizations?

Because if you're using that to discredit what I said, surely you must be the opposite, right?"

So he's keeping Obama's trend, but actually doing worse than they estimated from how Obama started it. Did you even click the link I shared to you?

>-Unemployment rate is the lowest it’s been in 50 years.

Same as above..

>-Median Household income surpasses $63,000.

Same as above.

>-2.4 million Americans lifted out of poverty.

So, because of an increased job market and economy that he didn't turn around, the expected result happened. Neat! Cause and Effect!


>-Small business optimism broke 35-year record.

Lmao, do you even know how they measure 'small business optimism'? Because, again, thanks Obama!

>-Poverty and unemployment in minority communities reaches lowest in 50 years.

Further proving you don't understand how economies work.

>-Stock market is repeatedly pushing record highs.

And record swings, too!"
dankmemes,ffqanb3,t1_ffq943m,1580128393.0,"Lmfao. If they pay enough, I should probably pay about 5% then, right? Why should I be going in at the same rate they are?

You're disillusioned if you think even a majority of the current insanely wealthy worked hard to get where they are at. The majority just birthed from the right vagina."

The European nation's would be fine with us scaling our military back considerably. Don't even joke that we NEED to be spending three times the next largest nation's military.

You have no idea what you're talking about. Lmao."
dankmemes,ffq982b,t1_ffq8exz,1580126760.0,"Because all the European nation's that also have universal healthcare and public college education are really drowning and falling apart, right?

Problem is the people like you who think they do understand economics when they don't have the slightest.

We currently pay more per capita than any other country for healthcare.. Universal Healthcare will SAVE the US money.

Public education expanded to College allows less debt, higher paying jobs, which means more spending, which fuels the economy."

Trump hasn't made the economy better, he's keeping the trend, which is fine, but definitely not something to boast about.

You should probably start by learning about how the economy works in general before attributing its current status to Trump."
