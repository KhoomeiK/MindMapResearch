rva,ff8ptfo,t1_ff8dl8z,1579690886.0,"This is totally wrong. The whole point of a TIF is that it only takes the additional revenue from property taxes, not all, generated by the project. Let's say building x which is next to a disused building and a crumbling surface lot currently generates 5 mil in revenue and then the city builds an arena next door and a private developer builds a highrise.  Now let's say building x generates 10 million in revenue, the city takes the 5 mil it was always collecting and would continue to collect if they didnt build the arena, and the lender gets the rest until the loan is paid and then the city gets 100%. The revenue from the arena itself is largely totally irrelevant, as the profits don't pay the bills anyway and the management company, who are not in the business of losing money, is keeping the place booked and maintained are the ones who lose money also if they can't make the arena work."
rva,ff8p08a,t1_ff7lirf,1579689706.0,Richmond has a surprising number of these huge events. Have you ever been Downtown when the bazilllion Jehovas Witnesses show up every year and pack the Coliseum?
rva,ff8ow6b,t1_ff70k0b,1579689540.0,"You can't really say ""instead of the city getting that money, Tom Ferrell and his boys will"" for two reasons. One is that without the development there is no money, so there is no ""instead"", if is that there is no development there will be no increase in property tax revenue to the city or anyone. The other is that if a bank were to lend the city money they should expect to be paid back from the TIF as agreed, that would be a normal loan agreement with a bank that every city in the country does for major projects and not ""Tom Farrell's boys"" getting our money. 

If the city wants to make the most of this area development wise it will need to put some skin in the game the way it did 40+ years ago when the Coliseum was built in the first place. This Navy Hill proposal seems like a sensible arrangement with private investment dovetailing with public to do something with a wasted piece of property. It's not free, amd that may be a good sign. What you really have to look out for are developers who want to promise you the world and it won't cost you a dime, wheres the catch? With this the ""catch"" is a TIF which is out in the open and a pretty straight forward known entity used by dozens of other successful cities."

rva,fecqae6,t1_fecp5s2,1578980704.0,Don't confuse my intrest in using available information to stop and prevent crime for some sort of bleeding heart for the psycho. My way you actually lock more psychos up without all the wasted effort being a retard on purpose as with your approach.
rva,febsw3r,t1_febm8l8,1578962267.0,"Easier sure, but this behavior is almost always a product of trauma. Knowing what that trauma is helps us lock up whoever did god knows what to this kid, and whatever other kids they might have access too. This stuff almost never come from nowhere. My view is that when this stuff happens with minors the police need to be up the ass of every adult that even so much as looked at this kid  from age 2 through today, this started somewhere, we need that figured out just as much if not more than getting this kid treatment."

rva,fdn4z2b,t1_fdmxa6k,1578577426.0,"Not really. These low commitment sometimes high return contract gigs are presently beset on all sides by opposition from liberal municipal and state governments as well as left leaning publications under the frankly insidious guise of protecting the rights of workers. When in fact they are trying to collapse a new and lucrative way for the middle and lower classes to earn extra income, at the same time that they trip over themselves accomplishing nothing to support labor and protect workers rights generally. Who's ""full of shit"" is a privileged Oberlin English BA writing in Jacobin how terrible these jobs are for America's working poor without bothering asking them how actual working class people feel about it. The problem with labor isnt the gig economy side hustles, it's constricting wages at regular jobs and skyrocketing healthcare costs. The gig economy is just a way for actual working class people to deal with the fact that the neoliberal democratic party has sold them down the river. That's who's full of shit."
rva,fdlvbah,t1_fdlt9z5,1578533340.0,"Some people need a second job some times regardless of their first. Unexpected expences happen, paying down a credit card balance, your kid wants to go to space camp. Having a jobs that allow you to work when it fits your schedule is a big deal. My favorite Lyft driver from last year was  a shipyard guy from Norfolk in town to visit his daughter at VCU for parents weekend. He was waiting for her to finish class and was taking a few rides to kill time and help his daughter get an engineering degree. It is genuinely awesome that he doesn't have to commit to a night stocking job at Walmart, or commit 5+ hours waiting tables, or even the risk of starting his own side business.  He can take a few fares and break even on taking his daughter out to dinner. That rules. And OP rules for working hard and handling his business."

 Yet I have yet to meet or talk to an actual Lyft/Uber/grubhub driver that doesn't enjoy the freedom to make a buck here and there without committing to be a cab driver/delivery person on a schedule.  I am glad you were able to make ends meet in 2019, and I hope you have a very prosperous 2020."
ak47,fdhwy24,t1_fddwrn4,1578431651.0,I'm not cutting the retainer I'm cutting the guard itself. Why would I spend an additional 23 dollars when I can just cut it myself. Its no beauty queen.
ak47,fdhwr4o,t1_fdf4sgq,1578431547.0,Easy peasy. I over cut a little but its no biggie. I will need to remove more material to use the sling loop but for now I'm happy. Made my cuts then the dremel sanding wheel made the edges nice and clean.
rva,fdhwfqf,t3_eldss3,1578431388.0,"After seeing the billboards for years I finally decided to check it out last year. I ordered the porkchop special and my dining partner ordered fish and mac and cheese. It was hands down the worst meal I've had at a restaurant in memory. It wasn't dangerous like some of the food from Ramsey's Show but it was truly terrible. The chops were hard and way over cooked possibly reheated, and everything else on my plate was clearly from a can, all for 18.99. My partner's meal was somehow worse. The mac and cheese noodles were so undercooked they were hard and the cheese sauce was inedible, The side salad was full of wilted lettuce and i don't think she even ate the fish. It was truly astonishing that there were other people in there and that the place hadn't already been shuttered."
