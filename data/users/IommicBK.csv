Boveda packs are good for regulating and maintaining hydration, but are slow at rehydrating. 

You can also soak a roll up paper filter tip in water and stick it to the inside of a jar. 1 raw filter strip = rehydrates 1 eighth. Use a boveda pack with it, and it'll make sure it doesn't overhydrate. Once the weed is hydrated enough not to be ultra hydroscopic, the boveda sucks in the excess and then releases it slowly over time giving the moisture time to even out through the buds. Especially with denser stuff, the outside will rehydrate before the inside. Like dry/cure process but in reverse. 

If you just use boveda, they will dry up and need to be recharged. You can only recharge a few times before they stop working properly or begin to leak. Once it's all hard, its done. If you keep the bovedas hydrated, that won't happen. So compensate for the moisure loss by including extra moisture in the container with the weed and boveda together."

AskReddit,ffelcfk,t1_ffeg5am,1579852921.0,"> Its ridiculous to say that out of nearly 300 million people, less than 10% lived decent lives by global standards.

Absolutely. Bread lines, nearly nonexistent healthcare, terrible living conditions, poor sanitation, sparse clothing, rolling blackouts, heatless winters. And that was just for the 100 or so million living in the major western cities. In the east, most people were either still in the 17th century, or in a work camp. The majority of the cities east of the urals were actually originally gulags, where people were worked to death with less than the bare minimum of nutrition and clothing. 

don't forget, the event that spurred the gorbachev's final motivation to open up to the west:

He went to visit a supermarket in texas (HEB). He was in absolute awe at the amount of food, and was in such disbelief that he drove around half a dozen other HEB's just to make sure they weren't fake. He had an absolute nervous breakdown that night. His communist loyalty bubble was burst, he could not bring himself to continue the system where his people had so little while people in the US had ""supermarkets"". 

He ended up starring in a pizza hut commercial for the first pizza hut in moscow shortly thereafter. He also traded a huge chunk of the russian navy for pepsi syrup. Previously he was trading stoly for pepsi, but pepsi couldn't sell all the stoly he was giving them so he gave them a navy fleet instead. True story. Not kidding. Look it up. 

You know things are really fucking bad when the government is having such a hard time meeting people's needs you have the president trading battleships for soda syrup. 

>Claiming that most people did better in the 90s is ignoring the spikes in mortality, siucide rates, and alcoholism that ocurred around that time, and the coinciding drop in birth rate. But you probably think that those statistics look the way they do because people were partying too hard, celebrating their newfound millions.

Your comment completely ignores the cooking of statistics under the USSR in addition to the absolutely massive casualties and infringements on basic human rights that were happening before the fall of the USSR. What happened after the fall, was truly a piece of cake in comparison to what was before, for anyone old enough for the perspective. 

However, things were pretty nice if you were a communist party loyalist with a cushy factory job in one of the major cities where you got to steal goods and sell them on the black market, like the thread OP's family. They were also quite nice if you were a complete degenerate, and did the bare minimum of work so they don't send you to a gulag while being responsible for draining the country dry. So those became the two general classes within russian society. The later is what accounts for your statistics. The former are who were fighting it out. It takes two to tango, live by the gun die by the gun, etc. The only people truly suffering in the wild west of the 90's were the people actively participating in it or the socially and economically useless degenerates who managed to reproduce thanks to socialism but found their darwinian terminus in a world where the value of their labor actually had to match their nutritional and emotional needs. The only reason suicide rates and alcoholism dropped since the 90's, is because darwin took care of the problem quickly. Doesn't matter how long you have a useless and dependent population; as soon as the support structure is gone, they die off. Doesn't matter if we are talking humans or ants, biology is all the same. Housing wasn't a problem through the 90's though, you could earn a year's rent in a week's worth of the lowest paid work, so at least the degenerates could had a roof over their head while they drank themselves to death knowing papa lenin isn't feeding them for free anymore.  

I'm not taking refuge in pedantry to be contrarian. I'm just shutting down someone who's clearly romanticizing the USSR and demonizing capitalism while completely ignoring the atrocities that were occurring under the USSR and how socialism created what they had in the 90's. People often like to downplay how bad the USSR was in an attempt to pump up american (""democratic"") socialism but the truth is it's all the same shit, and if you want to end up like russia in the 90's (and 80's, 70's, so on), go ahead and vote for berntardo panders. Clearly, you'd rather everyone suffer  equally, fester and rot together, rather than allow anyone to rise above it all. Crabs in a barrel....."

Teslas are also not devoid of ""parts"". Just because they aren't mechanical, doesn't mean they don't break down, or cost alot to fix or replace. And teslas are much more expensive to fix and replace than any mechanical car, simply because tesla has a near monopoly on the service. Just because you have a warranty, doesn't make it cheap when the warranty expires. Or when you have to get it towed three counties over and wait six months to get it fixed. People have this illusory perception of teslas being so simple and devoid of mechanical or electrical problems, immune to most car problems. As if it propels itself via anti-gravity! it's so silly. Teslas are actually alot more complicated than gas vehicles. They also weigh twice as much. Model X weighs more than an F250. Go figure!

Yes it is true DEALERS make more money on parts. 

However, when you deal with a company like subaru or hundai, you are forced to buy their parts. they have a monopoly. so they can charge what they want. 

Toyota and Ford are more open source, and they have alot of 3rd party equipment for you to choose from. And they actually build their cars so that an ordinary person could perform most basic repairs. 

Except buying a toyota or ford is significantly more expensive than a subaru or hundai. This is because being poor is more expensive.

but subarus are not actually reliable, nor are they cheap to fix. their reliability is a myth. mechanically they will keep running. Structurally however, flimsy junk.

I owned a subaru as my first car. I don't regret buying it. Owned it for three years and put 45k miles on it. It was junk though. I paid 30k for it, brand new, and ended up putting 25k into it just to keep it from falling apart. Brake pads, brake rotors, oil changes, new tires constantly, new rims, new door latches. Most of those had to be done at the dealership, which would take three weeks to order a latch then charge me $600 for it. Got into a fender bender, new bumper was $2100. Had my windows broken, they were more expensive than BMW windows. Eventually (after a bunch of mountain driving) my brake rotors warped for the second time around at 45k miles at which point the entire wheel/brake/suspension assembly was so rusted they would have had to replace most of it, they quoted me for $12k. I sold it for 3k, got myself a toyota, and save for a few flats and the usual oil change, at 90k miles i've barely hit $3k in maintenance costs."
GetMotivated,ff3ioq0,t1_ff3709i,1579541873.0,"not just that. As the old saying goes ""being poor is expensive"".   


The way this applies to cars, is through cost of ownership. This isn't applicable to all brands or models, but the problem is still very persistent.   


More reliable cars cost more money. The cheaper cars are cheaper because they are not built to last or take alot of abuse.   


This doesn't apply to everything though, as for example toyotas are relatively inexpensive and durable compared to their european or american counterparts. 

But generally speaking, when comparing vehicles in the same class (this does not apply to european cars), the more expensive one will be cheaper to own assuming you plan on driving it past 100k miles. Every single part will be heavier duty than the cheaper cars.   


For example, subarus are great cars, for what they do, at their price point. However, their paint gets dull real fast. The stock tires and rims are unreliable, and are likely to go flat+get a bent rim before you hit 10k miles; and they lose alot of pressure when temperature fluctuates. They are barely insulated, despite being designed around winter driving. Any place that isn't visible from a human's perspective, is a complete mess (check under the steering column over the gas pedals on any subaru, gahhhhh). The underbody, suspension, everything underneath the car and in the engine bay is made from a cheap alloy that is highly prone to rusting. I've seen subarus with 20k miles in the northeast that were so rusted out underneath they were effectively totaled. Even the door latches are prone to breaking within 5 years. 

Then try fixing a subaru.....costs 10x more to fix than any ford or toyota.   


But the subaru does the same thing the volvos do...just at a quarter of the price. 

Japanese and american automakers, with the exception of subaru, tend to try to factor the cost of ownership when they design certain cars as they consider it a selling point.   


The korean manufacturers along with mercedes and BMW do not care about cost of ownership, and they make up for it with luxury bells and whistles and (alleged) customer service. Volkswagon and volvo along with the other lesser known euro brands are mostly trying to find some middle ground between the two design approaches, but end up with a master of none situation."

What you're spouting, is a bunch of radical bullshit. You conception of sexuality is mot agreed on by science, at all. Period. Telling kids they are gay when they aren't only hurts people. Teaching kids they are trans when they are just trying to find their identity, is absolitely damaging. You know what i did see alot of? I saw tons of boys/men who were very, very straight and left their families because their mothers insisted on feminizing them, like low key versions of ""desmond is amazing"". These kids would say they were gay because they were raised to be gay...but they were straight as an arrow. They had as much trouble coping with their straightness as gay kids in the 70's had coping with their gayness. The only community that they felt accepted in, was the gay community because they were raised in it to some degree. And now they can't accept being normal, so they wallow in their own self pity and aurround themselves with people they cant sexually relate to, which just exacerbates their alienation and self pity. 

The worst part is the communities they invest themselves into in order to feel like they belong, are just as or even more toxic than the family situations they left, and it provides no real social or financial backbone for them. They are taught to believe mainstream society doesnt want them, so they join grouos that do, only to find out in their late 20's (if they even live that long) that the groups they associated themselves with, provided no long term benefits. 

Your attitude does no one any favors. Though, thankfully, your attitude does help get those kids out, because it shows them how truly not-accepted they are within their own tribe and makes them feel like they could rejoin society.

The number of kids actually being ""kicked out"" of families and unable to maintain a decent living situation is far lower than activists like to imagine. 

Most kids on the street are there because their parents/legal guardians are fucked up and abused them or have some other extreme level of dysfunctionality that left the kid effectively mentally crippled. Often sex abuse leads to (false) lgbtq self-identification. Just because a kid thinks he's gay because his uncle raped him, doesn't make him gay, and just because a girl resents men so much over what they did to her, doesn't mean she's really a lesbian. Unfortunately we have a bunch of idiots running around social media trying to tell these kids they are gay, which really just complicates their mental health and personal development and makes the situation even worse for them.

I'd never trust any semiauto with a round in the chamber *unless* it's on a super secure kydex drop leg and only as a backup when carrying a long gun, for faster transitions in active combat or high threat security roles. Or, if i'm carrying a g20 in bear country in the same drop leg.  Either of those situations have been very few and far between in my life.

Otherwise for more crowded environments *to protect other people* if it's concealed it's going to be in a bag of some sort, because dressing around a full size gun is a bitch and i'm not using a compact for protecting others, because the ranges are inevitable going to be longer.

The only situation where having a round in the chamber really counts, is when someone is right on top of you. Muggings, fights, carjackings. In these situations you need to assume your other hand is going to be disabled or occupied; and having to rack the slide gives the aggressor an opportunity to safely take the gun away. So for those circumstances, you get a snubnose, hammerless double action only with a super-heavy trigger. Accuracy doesn't matter and you dont need many shots because if you're using it, it's going to be within inches of the bad guy, point blank.

Generally as far as i'm concerned, for legal liability's sake, all justifiable self-defense scenarios in public environments occur within knifing distance, so you do need a round in the chamber, but you don't need much more than a snubnose 38 or 357.

Any defensive scenario that occurs at greater than knifing range, *will be in defense of others or property.* This requires range and accuracy, but those extended ranges allow for time to seek cover and rack the slide; while simultaneously presenting a great deal of safety challenges that necessitate ""israeli carry""."

Environmentalism started out as a conservative effort long before the left picked it up during the late 60's. Conservatives, hunters and farmers especially, remain staunch environmentalists. You think they are not, because you have been brainwashed to believe any approach to environmentalism outside the bounds of the prevailing left wing script is wrong, or anti-science. Which it is neither. There are many opinions, and approaches, to how the environment should b preserved and managed. You have yours, and conservatives have theirs.

The phrase ""we really need"" gives you away as a partisan shill, who isn't doing much thinking for themselves. Who's ""we""? and you ""need"" people to agree with you....because you assume you are correct? who exactly are you speaking for in this ""we""? and do you own guns or hunt? are you an environmental scientist? when is the last time you did anything for the environment? what is your own environmental footprint? I bet it's worse than the guy who doesn't buy supermarket meat because he harvests his own every fall, still drives the same car he bought in 1994 and composts all his food waste, which is pretty typical in much of ""red"" america. and he's not composting because he needs to virtue signal about it in facebook and feel better about eating takeout out of plastic every night because he lives in a city, he's doing it because his garden needs that compost and otherwise he haul his own trash to the dump once a month and he doesn't need old food stinking up the trash all month.

The evidence is quite clear - look at how polluted democrat-dominated states had become during the last 50 years, and compare that to how pristine the more conservative states have remained. Even with fracking, red states have a long, long way to go before they even approach the level of environmental damage and pollution places like New York, New Jersey, and California have done. California has the strictest environmental laws....and the worst air, worst water, and most polluted cities. Democrats control industry too, just like republicans and the industries that pollute the most...they are all headquartered in democrat controlled areas.

Problem is the libtards who go around with an existential hate for guns, never wanting to let their kids near them. For example, I have this one libtard relative. He hates guns, and loves comic book morals - ""batman never used a gun!"". It's this mystique that makes guns so dangerous in our society, we instill a sort of fearful reverence of weapons into kids and some kids just take advantage of it in disastrous ways. At one point after the synagouge shooting last year he was talking to me about wanting to buy a shotgun.

So i explain, maybe you should go to the range, try out a few guns, make sure you can use a shotgun effectively.

He says to me ""naah, i just want it for the presence, I want the presence of a shotgun. i want something nice like a bennelli, put in on the wall or something so people see it"".

so, i asked him, ""are you prepared to use that gun to kill a *human being* who is threatening to hurt your family?""

and he got really quiet, because he knew the answer was no. he had no interest in learning about guns, or practicing at all. but he might buy one anyway, just so he can pretend to look like someone who does.

Then i asked him and his wife if i could take his two daughters to the range and teach them, so they don't shoot themselves when they end up being the ones saving his pussy ass with the gun he mounted on his living room wall.

The response? the girls were super excited at the idea. The wife threw a fit ""no no no my nice jewish girls aren't going anywhere near any weapons no no no"" and that was the end of it.

They own immense amounts of american currency, which they can dump on the market crippling the US in a way that would make the great depression look like a small recession. 

They own most of the cryptocurrency infrastructure too, and hold most of the world's gold reserves, and chinese nationals own trillions of dollars in real estate in north america and europe so they can just easily dump those as well, leaving no safe financial haven. 

They produce so many essential goods as well, that americans would be in dire straights without the consumer product infrastructure provided by china. They can manipulate the price of anything, and put entire industries out of business by outcompeting them.

nottheonion,fem7rn4,t1_fem5tav,1579242818.0,"Russia can easily enforce stability - through a dictatorship and a unified culture that accepts and respects that power structure. One of the key ways they do this is through the draft, and through a very functional, unified public school system. Every male enters the army at 18 and its nearly impossible to get out of it unless you have severe health problems, or leave russia. This creates a certain level of unity and comraderie. Putin might not have 90% approval ratings, but they are well over 50%. 

The major thing to consider is how much disaster, war, political upheaval, and economic depression russia has experienced over the last few centuries and still kept chugging along effectively unchanged. New bosses, new names, same as the old bosses. They are resilient. The population shrugs everything off. Sure communism is gone, the wall fell, etc. Russia was unable to maintain their grip in some of the more foreign republics. But in russia's core, as it stands now, shit just keeps moving along. No one can possibly even concieve in their minds a reality where the place they live is anything but russia. 

The lack of stability that existed in the 90's was ironed out and won't ever repeat itself. It was anarchy, when the communists fell there simply was no government. but in that anarchy a power structure arose, with putin eventually sitting at the top. The power extends through every government agency, private business, and underworld mafia in an unbroken, rock solid pyramid. Because of this, in my opinion, russia is probably the most politically stable country in the world. 

The US is more stable in theory, but it hasn't weathered the type of anarchy and disaster russia has, or developed the type of rigid heirarchy russia has. 

Furthermore their intentions and motivations are clear and havent changed in centuries. They are primarily driven by security, profit, status, and luxurious indulgence, like most other cultures, but to a capitalistic extreme (rebounding after communism). Their strategy to achieve security, primarily, has always been to maintain enormous buffer zones between russia's core and the rest of the world. Conquest and absorbtion=security to the russian mentality, and its been that way for centuries. 

The US is meddling in the middle east as well, often in worse ways, and sometimes the same ways. You can't blame russia for trying to influence iran when we also tried to by giving them money. We both invaded afghanistan. Neither assad nor ISIS are virtuous in any way, but we financed and supplied isis intially as an anti-assad force, while putin wanted to stabalize things by taking the opposite approach and financing the existing govt - assad. We have deposed dictators and forced regine changes, created problems far worse than when we started in libya, iraq, pakistan, yemen, syria, vietnam, north korea, el salvador, nicaragua, mexico, list goes on and on and on. The US demands global hegemony, russia just wants regional expansion and it butts heads with the US when that expansion interferes with the US's plans. Realistically the only region under potential russian threat are the baltic states. But that's kinda like the quebecouis worrying about america taking it over and making it north new york.

However steel is better than timber and we have a hundred different types of drywall you can use depending on how you want to build things, that's just one basic example. Then there is zoning and building code improvements that have changed things alot. Some places have stricter standards than others, they differ depending on climate/geography and were implemented at different times so there is alot of variety in that regard in the US. But just building a basic house, is now 10x more expensive than it was anywhere 50 years ago not just because of material, labor, and legal costs but also because the houses have to be built to a much higher standard.   


Really, anything built between WW2 and the late 90's in the USA is complete garbage. Things have improved drastically since then.

There hasn't been a more ethnically, culturally, or religiously diverse first family yet. Nor have we ever had any jews in the first family before, which to me, is a big deal.

There is alot more disagreement, ideological diversity, and conversation within the repiblican and libertarian constituencies and parties than within the democrat and green party constituencies and parties. It's also an objective fact, a quick comparison of voting records, state laws, court decisions, candidate platforms, should illustrate it for you. 

On a more anecdotal level, consider how different a republican oilman from texas, a colorado rancher, blue collar michiganer, a conservative christian from kansas, an upstate new yorker, a backwoods appalachian charlottesville marching hillbilly, and a jewish palm beach retiree might think. Completely different cultures and demographics. Yet they all find something to agree on and voted for the same guy. 

Then compare any two cultures within the democrat constituency. They all expect ideological unity and purity, and they go around attacking each other over relatively trivial disagreements or offenses that people on the right really don't care about. There is barely amy difference between how a black chicagoan, jewish upper west side liberal new yorker, hispanic angeleno, a crusty portlander and an austin hippie thinks. They have a very narrow window of acceptable thoughts, ideas, amd speech, and that window is ever shifting depending on the needs of the greater whole. Dare step outside that window, and you become excommunicated from the community like kevin hart at the oscars.

Hvac and humidity....you have to understand something. 

Cooling only dries out the air when the dewpoint is same or higher than the cooling surface inside the HVAC. When the cool surface, or air hits the warm air from outside this creates condensation, inside the hvac, in the ducting, in the air, and on any surface that happens to be cooler than the dewpoint. During the summer, dewpoints all over the east coast can hit the 60s-70s creating alot of condensation and mold every single year. 

Then if you live in a place where the dewpoints are low through the summer, like the southwest, you may often find swamp coolers, which are just glorified humidifiers. The moisture cools the air up to 30 degrees below ambient, as far as the dewpoint, without any need for actual cooling tech (coolants/compressors etc). 

And then during the winter its often the inverse. The air is extremely dry with very low dew points. People keep their homes and offices tightly sealed. Humidity and stagnant air acuumulates. Every time the door or window is opened, instead of drying out the space it just causes the moisture to percipitate out of the air and fall as microdroplets (think breath steam when you breath on a cold day). All that moisure just turns to liquid before it could vacate the space, and when the windows are closed again it evaporates back out into the room. This is why you, for example, see condensation on windows in the winter. 

When people experience skin or sinus dryness in the winter, its usually from the constant switch between cold/dry and humid/warm. Dry plus low dewpoint causes your skin to dry out. If you still spend all your time indoors, your skin or nose will have a harder time adapting. Add in a sealed space with pathogens going around and your sinuses are getting bombarded by stress without giving them the ability to adapt or recover. It's even worse for people who live in the south during the summer, because the dewpoints are so high the hvac does such a great just drying out the air but now you're spending enough time outside for your skin and sinuses to be conditioned to moist air. Most people are living in oppositeworld as far as what their body needs for proper climatic adaptation. Spoiled 1st worlders haha


Like i mentioned intitially, i would expect most doctors offices to have an air purifier running. This cuts down on alot of problems significantly. Proper air purification, as done by industry, insurance, and legal standards, combines a variety of technologies to condition the air too, through dehumidification, humidification, cooling heating, ionization, uv light, electrostatic plating, carbon and hepa filtration. It'll be tailored to the type of building and climate.

If this is in the northeast, or really anywhere east of the misissipi or on the west coast north of mendo, the climatic conditions create enough moisture for mold. Nevermind even considering actual water damage, which the wood can easily hide as well. 

Loads of very old buildings that are mold free, and loads that are guaranteed to have it. Depends on where and how it was built. Most residential and small office buildings built before the mid 80's (depends on the state too, which all have different building codes that were updtated or created at different times) are going to have mold problems unless they have been effectively gutted.

Peoole used to use wood panels in basements because it helped prevent mold to some degree, especially when up against a damp surface like a cold foundation.

Drywall is alot more prone to mold growth but it is immediatly apparent and visible. Its also cheaper to clean up and replace. Which is part of why people use it so much now. 


And honestly i'd feel even better being in a dirty horse barn shoveling compost than i would in that office. And i do shovel compost in barns often.
