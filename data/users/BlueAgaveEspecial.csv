DiWHY,fdilbaz,t1_fdiiwq6,1578445446.0,"Pretty fucking cool. To picture it it was a gentleman's study. Modest sized, the secret door was a dark, rich mahogany with 6 panels framed in an Georgian mahogany frame. The walls were clad in a rich purple burgundy, corduroy/Hessian type material, this broken up by the mahogany picture rail, dado rail, and skirting. Herringbone parquet flooring a giant Asian rug on top. The ceiling had Georgian ornate coving and a highly decorative ceiling rose painted in a dark green details picked out in gold.
On entry there was a carved stone fireplace on the right with a chunky black fire fender, and a beautiful gold framed Georgian mirror. The smell of burnt oak, paper and the unusual fabric walls permeated the air. Two high backed leather armchairs in front of the fire either side a small drinks table between them. The alcoves either side of the chimney breast filled with books and various curiosities/ornaments from there travels.
A small sash cord window centred on the wall opposite the door. With a green pelmet and thick heavy dark green curtains. Flanking the window both sides were paintings of the Napoleonic era battles and service men. Each with a brass picture light.
On your left a huge desk leather topped strewn with papers, open books, a typewriter and smoking pipes. Little drawers barely visible on the back wall under all the clutter, the lamps on the desk almost seems to being growing from the mess. Another tall backed armchair, antique again, in green leather, mahogany and brass studs. A huge painting of a Napoleonic battle set in a heavy gold frame hung above the desk with Georgian brass wall sconces either side.
On the wall where the door is a mahogany antique dresser filled with various liquors, alcohols, a humidor, and books, ornaments, curiosities.

It was like something out of Sherlock Holmes honestly one of the coolest rooms I have been in. It was so inviting and fascinating."
