todayilearned,ffd868c,t1_ffck6z8,1579815297.0,That was a great read. So good it could be a joke.
nba,ffcqqb0,t1_ffbki5z,1579805270.0,"Tbh, I'd much rather have paedophiles handle their own urges at home than those urges becoming so unbearable that they wouldn't be able to control the impulse to go out there and actually molest a kid. Also, 25 millions is well worth it. The kid will be set for life and will actually afford to follow his passions when he grows older, instead of working a desk job and spent his twenties and thirties paying for student loans and rent for a crappy two-time apartment, which he shares with his high school friend, Randy, who leaves on a steady diet of Cheetos and Dr. Pepper."

DecidingToBeBetter,ff9mskg,t3_ese6g5,1579716274.0,"Some years ago I held a midweek dinner party for my friends and told them I was sick of my job and was gonna quit at the end of them month.
Next day it was raining so much you'd think it was nighttime at 11am still. I got called to a room by my boss and got fired. I was absolutely ecstatic and, as soon as I stepped out of the office, the clouds dissipated and the beautiful summer sun came out. I did a quick stop at home to change and went straight to the beach. It was one of the most memorable days of my life. It felt as if I had been freed from a burden and welcomed into freedom with the sun and the ocean. Life has this little moments, we just gotta make the most of it."

AskReddit,fd1jt7h,t1_fd0fijz,1578132229.0,"That's normal anywhere. Stop being nervous and start really listening to them, ask questions about the history of the place, the stories, the anecdotes. Eventually you'll know each other. But remember that there are different types of friendships and these could be the ones where you're learning something about life from people who have lived it for a longer time than you."

Foodforthought,fcl30uv,t3_ehl45u,1577738709.0,"All I have figured this far is this: money is a limited resource. If a very small group of people gather most of it, there will be less of it going around. We'll reach a point where there's not enough of it going around, rending it useless. Money is only as valuable as it is shared, if there's less of it being shared, it has less value. Naturally, as history has shown again and again,  Revolutions ensue."
