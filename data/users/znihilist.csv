StarWars,fbx76lf,t3_eey1zm,1577172374.0,"Went to see it last night, I have been mulling over it and kinda lost where to start.

Adam Driver is just amazing, his performance through this trilogy only got better with every movie! He was the highlight of the movie by far and he gave us the best that we could hope for in regards to Kylo or Ben. Almost every scene featuring Kylo + Rey was good, and I'd say those were very well done. 

On the opposite side, every scene that features Palpi was bad, and I have a hard time understanding how this script was greenlighted, I am not going to shit on FA or TLJ, but this trilogy's downfall was the lack of overall focus, it is pretty bad to (re-)introduce Palpi in the scrawl and then spend the first 40 minutes jumping from place to place to place because they lacked the foresight of having an overarching story for the sequel, a transmission heard is not good enough. Plapi being back is not the issue per se, but the way they nonchalantly bring him back makes the ending very silly, if he came back then why is this ""death"" any different? What's so special about it? A cool death scene is meaningless, and it didn't add anything meaningful to the saga. And that's not the only issue, the movie keeps creating these problems that get solved but ends up being irrelevant in the long term, and because of that, it feels both too short and too long at the same time, too much filler and too little substance.

I know I am going to be called a troll for the following, but I'd say this movie is inching to be the worst of the entire saga, even The Phantom Menace had a vision and a clear path. IMO this movie is an utter failure (in terms of story), and I hope Disney has learned their lesson of overreacting and overcorrecting in the face of every single loud criticism they got.

EDIT: Retconning Rey's origin was very jarring, and it was not needed, the story could have played out very similarly without any change if they just left it the way it was in TLJ (not that it was great the way it was in TLJ, but the retcon was felt shoehorned and out of place)."
