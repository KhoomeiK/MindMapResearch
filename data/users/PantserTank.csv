I don't upvote or downvote posts, because votes are meaningless, pointless and you can't buy anything with ""karma"".  And I have 700 unread messages in my inbox, bc I'm not some lonely heart looking for a pen pal, I come here to say whatever the fuck I say on the board as part of a discussion.  Once I've read a thing, thought about it for a sec, and responded to it, I'm done, and have no need to revisit old discussions I already commented on and left behind.  Even threads like this, what does voting tell you that's important?  That at this hour, people from some unknown demographics from some unknown countries voted that this specific topic that they half-read resonated with them that it was a this or that...  I mean what the hell, is this going into a useful compendium of knowledge for future generations to learn from or, no it's just someone who thought they'd waste some time writing a prompt and then a whole lot of the rest of us also wasting our time responding to it.  What a total waste of our lives.

Occasionally if I come across someone really stupid and shitty, I'll just click on their comments and downvote about 10 pages of everything they've posted til I get bored and go get coffee and never think about them again.

I think it's inevitable that genetic warfare will remove the human species within this century, but the aftermath of the chaos of collapsing destructive forces will send all the ecosystems (currently being destroyed anyway) into a crazy unpredictable tailspin, when the selection criteria for survival are at least as artificial as natural in predators and prey relationships.  Opportunities for more intelligent species to excel will abound, but that's a human talking in our own image.  Opportunities for less intelligent, more brutal species will abound too.  And bigger.  And smaller.  And more poisonous, and more boring, and less hungry, and less social, etc etc etc.  The longer the holocene takes, the more species we take with us into the dirt, but the sooner its over, it might be followed by another explosion due to all the planets biggest pressure valves being opened at once."

It's why everyones least favorite Anderson film, Life Aquatic, is my favorite film of all time.  Even with the fantasy elements it's the most realistic movie he's made.  Life is not like a movie, it's sloppy, uneven, unpredictable and punctuated by moments of unrealistic beauty and simple stupidity without prompt or warning & human relationships & dialogue aren't always slick as a script or rehearsed & polished, often enough they're poorly communicated and unclear.  The ""pack of strays"" line & ""I said those things/I did those things..."" are some of the most prescient lines in Andersons work.  To actually pursue & end up in fantastical lives of adventure practically requires a flexible grasp on reality, and the idealistic dreamers who end up there often do because of their messy lives and difficult personalities.

aww,femtjos,t1_femqgqc,1579269194.0,"No, they’re not like that.  They’re not birds in a nest.  Fawns wander around and get into everything, tango with other animals, getting all kinds of muck and filth & smells on them. They seem to really like playing around with the goats. When the Doe’s return they invariably take them out into the lake and swim across the bay or over to the island, clean them off & get that scent sorted back out. We’ll take injured ones in to the vet here & there as barbed wire tears them up or drunk hunters take potshots at them out of their car windows.  

We get a lot of this here due to the geography & landscape. The wolves don’t come through here so it creates a sort of high up sanctuary they like.  Usually it’s stragglers leftover from hunted families.  This year we had 3 Doe raising 2 fawns and then a third fawn wandered in, then one Doe was killed over hunting weekend & the numbers reversed.

It’s funny, following the thread talking all about what vicious killers deer are, but when you’re around them long enough and they learn you’re not a threat, they’ve got a pretty fine disposition.  They also differentiate between adults and predator & prey species and read body language to assess threat levels, adopting different attitudes toward messing with their fawns for each.  Since their main natural defense is to flee, they go through life pretty timid, but at ease, they’re one of the sweeter animals around.  Unless you have a garden, then they’re a holy terror."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fej8q7p,t1_feiwb3h,1579161746.0,"Yes, of course.  If I look at any part of my past objectively, and not through the extremely childish, selfish view of myself at the young age I was at the time, then there is no nostalgia.  The laws and norms of the country have gotten steadily worse since 9/11 and I'm old enough to have had a front row seat in that, and another front row seat observing that an entire generation of young adults now exist that know of no other version of life in this country.  So in that sense, yeah, that's a definite loss of freedom and if I thought about it in a one-dimensional sense, it would be easy to be nostalgic about childhood.  But to cross the line into nostalgia, I would have to lie to myself that everyone wasn't also walking aroud depressed about a million things relevant at the time, like seeing my friends and neighbors die from HIV and waiting for nukes to fall out of the sky and all the abuse from our religious leadership and beatings from my Dad and the older kids in the area and all the hate from the girls I knew and how litigious and overprotective people still were from the 80s right-wing moral panic crusades.  There is nothing to be nostalgic about.  The events happened, there is no unhappening, you can't go back no matter how you play dress up and fool yourself into thinking you're in another time you'd fit better in.  I see kids all day, and usually the ones that dress up in mismatched 80s & 90s clothes talk about the entertainment from that time as if its still relevant, and have a sense that they'd fit in then better than being the outcast they are now.  They're dead wrong.  If you were attractive enough that enough other attractive people wanted to fuck you, you could get away with wearing that shit and acting outrageously, otherwise, you drew critical attention to yourself and forget being an outcast, you'd get the holy shag knocked out of you just as quick.  There is no more accepting time in US history to be in than right now.  I spend all day in a university where professors don't dare mention that events are taking place that may have political consequences because there may be trump kids in the class and we can't offend them.  You can literally be a nazi out and proud all a few people will do is yell at you that you're being dumb.  Rewind a few decades and try that and see what dumpster they find your broken body in.  I'm glad that some of you got to live such wonderful lives that this is actually an objectively worse time to live in than the past, but realize what you're willing to overlook by succumbing to nostalgia."

One can appreciate that the 1880s into the 1920s cranked up progressive humanist philosophy & began making big changes to culture & society, without being nostalgic and wishing you lived in that time.  Outside those progressive circles (and inside was no picnic either), fuck no, thanks.  
The pre-colonial western hemisphere is one of the most incredible periods of anywhere in the world to study, and appreciate that it all happened right here, & we're all living in the results of those peoples efforts and brutal lives today.  But you'd have to be delusional to want to step out of a time machine in 1050, even at the height of the Cahokia civilization.

There have been periods of innovation, but overwhelmingly the innovations have been in the interest of reducing cost to commodify the product into cheap, planned-obsolescence disposable junk.  Without banging on about all pro's & cons of all the changes we've been part of in Design over the last few decades, the late 1950s & 1960s saw the end of lifetime product lifecycles, & the widespread adoption of cost engineering & forced rapid iteration.  Luckily, Americans bought the advertising, and in 2 generations have learned to appreciate nothing and just keep consuming and filling the landfills insatiably.  Fucks your world, but great for business.  You can recognize that a blender from 1920 was made when electric motors were in their infancy compared to today, but was also made of a ton of metal, no flimsy anything, handmade and assembled, with sano, tidy design features all over it and hand-painted pinstriping and floral motifs like it was some work of art at the time, and it's easily servicable and still actually works smoothly, because it was still made in the era with the understanding that if you bought something, you would have it, occasionally repair it, and never replace it, because if you had to replace it, chances are you'd be pissed that the MFG sold you something that broke down and never buy from them again.  Brooks Stevens realized the money in selling post-war americans new trends every 7 years, every 3 years, every 18 months.  Every day.  And he was right.  Ever since, you're all buying what we're selling, and the landfills are swallowing it all up just as fast.  All the modern mixers you'll own and throw out aren't worth the energy it takes to recycle them.  A century later, that 1920s mixer is worth $2600, not because there's anyone alive today who remembers and is nostalgic for when it was made, but because of its properties as functional artifact that exudes the amount of work and care people actually put into its design and manufacture.

gatekeeping,fe9gtob,t1_fe7tguo,1578937432.0,"I think part of the trouble Star Wars began was, George Lucas wanted to make an epic in the vein of the early nickel serials kids used to watch in the theatres.  Han Solo was supposed to be a green bug-eyed monster and in his mind it was fairly corny and goofy.  But once the studio realized there was a technological revolution in effects on the brink, and put up good money to fund it all, a ton of serious, experienced people from westerns & romance epics were brought in to make sure the movie didn't become a money pit, and it became a more serious film an adult could really enjoy as well.  Lucas moped that he'd lost control, and in the end his wife Marcia, & Paul Hirsch sat down in the editing room to make it the fairly weighty (for the genre/time) grand adventure/romance/comedy/drama/western/epic it ended up being to an entire generation.  After all those people retired off, and Star Wars fell into Lucas' hands again, it became a kids cartoon, first figuratively then literally, & then suffered the fate of all good companies, getting bought by idiot execs with an inflated view of their own self importance, getting commoditized into the dirt until it's just a frappe of low quality drek that the original fans of the thing wish would just end rather than continually bludgeon everyones fond memories.
