AskAnAmerican,febhnpi,t1_fea0ot5,1578958873.0,"I think a lot of people who were born and raised and their parents and grandparents and so on in the Appalachians are used to a slow pace of life where they don‚Äôt really strive for the best, just for the basic. I really admire the way that people live there (here since I‚Äôm in the Tennessee part). It‚Äôs a really nice break for me from growing up in Southern California. 

That being said, I need to find a middle ground. Something faster than Appalachia, but slower than Los Angeles, lol."

The other 50% they said is likely a mix of guard, Asian, and terrier breeds. It gave me some possible examples like Great Dane, Malamute, Shar Pei, but I‚Äôm not sure which fit haha. 

Can I see yours?! I love seeing dogs that look like Sadie!"

Something that did give me a minor fix was uninstalling and reinstalling my graphics drivers."

I actually fully agree. I‚Äôm a little sister to an older sister who constantly shunned me and never let me be included in anything and we have little to no relationship. I‚Äôve always kinda wished I had a sibling like this who actually showed interest in the things I do. 

I guess the grass is always greener, right?"

legaladvice,fd5v6fn,t3_ek4fz4,1578181896.0,I tried doing some research for you and it looks like the most you can really do is send them proof of your residency in Australia (a bill or lease or something) and tell them you will not be attending your jury duty period. After that it just depends on if they decide to pursue it or not.

dogs,fclu0pz,t1_fclr5ok,1577756440.0,Exactly. Mixing a poodle with a beagle doesn‚Äôt make it a whole different thing. It‚Äôs a dog that is half poodle half beagle. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúpoogle‚Äù as it‚Äôs own different thing. I really don‚Äôt think people understand that a lot of the time.

I dunno much about cars in Australia but most of these cars look fine to me. Wouldn‚Äôt go with a Mitsubishi but I can see some Toyotas and Nissans at lower price ranges. The Hyundai that they bought doesn‚Äôt have the best safety or reliability ratings anyways, especially for being twice the price of a lot of these.

I sorted by lowest km first, since obviously an Audi or BMW or something like that at 13k is going to have high mileage."
