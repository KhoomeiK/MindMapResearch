CarletonU,fdf59zv,t1_fdf4v4a,1578353625.0,"Basically it's a course that teaches you how to design aerospace systems at a pretty detailed level. The course material itself isn't all that difficult but because it's a very important course for stream A-C students it has a very heavy workload. The overarching term project was to design a landing gear system for an aircraft and it was a lot of work. Not the worst course I've taken, but definitely the worst elective."
