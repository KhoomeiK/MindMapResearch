EDH,ffv0bto,t1_ffuzz1v,1580252795.0,"This is simply not true. A card's reminder text doesn't change the rules of the game; in fact a card's reminder text does nothing at all and it functions exactly the same with or without it.

That is very clearly an activated ability that can interrupt the resolution of spells which is incompatible with how abilities are activated.

If it was a triggered ability, that would be a little different, but even then it would still use the stack and would be ""too late"" to change the result of the die roll contained in a spell or ability's resolution.

The only thing that can interact with the resolution of a spell or ability like that is a replacement effect.

Something like:

television,ffrzkwe,t1_ffr9vpm,1580169528.0,"Honestly, not sure why you're getting downvoted. Maybe because you worded it weirdly. People only think that lump sum deals are bad because you only hear about the times where someone regrets selling the rights to their idea for a flat fee that ended up making millions/billions.

You never hear about the guy who had an idea that went fucking nowhere but sold it for a flat rate and has the good sense to shut the fuck up about it.

Flat fees are a risk free way to capitalize your intellectual property, if you don't regret it at the time and regret it later, that just means you mitigated risk that ended up paying out. But risk mitigation isn't worthless, and is often worth more than the potential for gain.

That being said, any time someone offers you a percentage or a check, seriously think about it because if they were reasonably certain that it would pan out, they wouldn't offer you the percentage (unless they thought you knew it would pan out, in which case they just want their slice of the pie). If someone just offers you the check, try negotiating the percentage deal. That's how George Lucas made all his money."

I'm not a SWG mega-brain, but this definitely doesn't sound right. Equip a set of armor and go fight stuff for a while. Armor loses durability based on how much damage it blocked. You will see that your helmet wears down about at the same rate your pants do, and your chest maybe a little faster than that. But it's still a roughly even split. Definitely not like 80/10/10 at the very least. If I had to ballpark it, it's probably like 50/30/20.

It definitely matters what you're fighting too. Fighting something that can choke you like nightsisters? You're going to die to mind first.

But in any case, your buffed health and action are going to be so far ahead of your mind, there's literally no reason not to full stack mind/willpower. Max mind buffs 1250, your run of the mill doctor can go above 3k.

Is it an important move? Yes. It's the first AOE ability you get, because Tuwai is handed to you at the start of the game.

This is further compounded that one of Tuwai's abilities is spoilsport, which increases aoe attacks by 25% (he loses this on evo, luckily, because it's only really good for shrill voice).

On the other hand, I don't agree with your sentiment that there's only a small minority vocalizing animosity towards cEDH players. Every time flash gets brought up, casual EDH players come out of the woodwork to sort of ~~mansplain~~ casualsplain that EDH ""is meant to be a casual format"". It's probably not an actual majority, sure, but the fact of the matter is that a large number of players think cEDH simply shouldn't have anything to do with the rules of EDH and are more than happy to twist the rule 0 logic back on those bringing it up as an argument, even though rule 0 is very clearly not compatible with the concept of a competitive format.

I guess what I'm saying here is that my problem isn't with the naysayers, but rather that the naysayers are given a disproportionate amount of ""power"" here because the rules of EDH are a dictatorship and not a democracy.
