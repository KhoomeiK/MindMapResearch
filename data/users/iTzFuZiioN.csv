My heart rate and breathing when waking up are both pretty low and show no signs of excitement.
My doctor said it could be my brain just not being able to distinguish dream from reality, so ""waking up"" in a dream causes my brain to physically wake me up. But he doesn't know a lot about this, and it's only a speculation of his."

AskReddit,fexo7v1,t3_eqpqjr,1579433910.0,"Sometime around 6th or 7th Grade, my parallel class collected money and offered me 100€ to jump from the sports hall roof and act like I was attempting suicide (from 4-5m lol), so they, who were in a room with perfect view of my ""attempt"", didn't have to take a test, they all were really not looking forward to. And I accepted it, thinking I would probably not hurt myself too much and get some time off school as well. And 100€ was quite a lot for me back then.

An hour or so before I would do it, a bunch of police cars showed up at our school. All the students were taken into classrooms and informed by their teachers, that they got a tip some students were involved in encouraging suicide and pressured someone to jump from the school roof and kill themselves. Turned out in the class offering me money a few people were strictly against the plan of their classmates and told the teachers, bad thing they had no clue what the plan actually was and were only able to tell the bit they knew. As teachers are, they really freaked out and overexaggerated what they were told and BOOM we had a police investigation on several students, including me, about I think you would call it ""aided murder"" and some other pretty serious charges.

Ended up being suspended from school for 2 weeks along with 3 others, and got questioned A LOT by the police. They at first didn't believe us and thought we were all working together to not encriminate us. After about 10 days they finally stopped their investigation and let us go, kinda believing us, but not really trusting us. For the next 2 months the police visitted our school regularly to look if everything was alright, and we were in detention twice a week for the following 4 months. Luckily in the end I even profitted from it, because the other students felt so guilty about getting me into trouble, they let me keep the money and started buying me food during breaks for almost half a year. Maybe I overacted the ""victim role"" to them by a little bit.

TL;DR: Made a stupid deal for 100€, which got me and other students in real trouble with the police. Got sorted out an ""only"" got detention for 4 months, other involved students payed for my food for half a year, because they felt guilty."
SuicideWatch,fesrhg3,t1_fesnb84,1579368244.0,">If I could switch to color then I wouldn't be on a suicide subreddit!

It's not this type of color, but in a sense of understanding things. You can't just assume something is this, and if it isn't it's that. There are always more sides to something than two extremes.

>When you go through soo many horrific people your perspective will change to a black & white, just like me.

It will only change, if you decide on focussing on those two. If you keep focussing on colors, they will stay in your life.

>Nobody has empathy for people like me, Accepting that I'm a victim is good because at least now I have empathy for myself.

That is just wrong. You might not experience people showing it to you, but many people have empathy for depressed and suicidal people (For example me, that's why I am sticking around this subreddit helping others, when I got over it). And you are only a victim of your own negative thinking. You can't feel empathy for yourself. I guess you mean you don't feel contempt for yourself anymore.

You are feeling this way and not getting better, because you are addicted to depression. Your brain craves the stimulation that depression provides you. And like any other junkie, getting off your drug is not easy. Getting off it is hard and you have to work for it."

That's the problem, if they were understanding enough, they wouldn't even fight with him in the first place. But many people who are acting the way his parents are, get the point when they get shown how they act by mimicing their behaviour. Ofc it can backfire, but it porbably would not get worse than the ""normal"" fights."
SuicideWatch,fesgb2p,t1_fesfcew,1579364884.0,"You can't view the world in black and white, switch on full color.

I never defended or validated his parents. In fact I rather did the opposite. But Viewing yourself as the victim and seeing them as the worst, also isn't a solution. His parents for sure aren't right to do so. But they aren't just evil and want him to suffer. They probably treat him that way, because they have problems themselves and let their steam off at him. But he should talk to them, everyone can be reasoned with to a certain extend. And if that doesn't work I suggested further steps to take, for finding a solution.

Edit: I never said he should become like them, he should only be as dominant and egoistic as they are, when they want to interrupt him and lecture him."

SuicideWatch,fermsfk,t3_eqg8kz,1579355896.0,"Hey, first thing I care about your problems and I want to read how you feel. Venting is always good, but having people to listen to it is even better.

I don't think your parents are generally bad people, but I can tell you they really aren't good for you. Not this way. Tell them how you truly feel. And when they try to interrupt you or lecture you, then be dominant as they are normally with you and be egoistic as they are. This is not how parent should treat their kids. If they want something to be done, like that coffee thing, they should be happy you did it for them or they should do it themselves, if you didn't do as they wanted. You aren't their slave, and have your own will.

If they don't listen to you or this does not change, then call for help. There are options like family therapy or if there is no other way call child protective services.

Most importantly do what is good for you, put yourself first. Don't put your parents before yourself, even if they have to bear the consequences. Don't let them make you feel bad about this, it's their fault."
SuicideWatch,ferjx9a,t3_eqfu5m,1579354835.0,"Stop the alcohol. It might seem like a solution, but it really is not. When you are sober these thoughts will only get worse, than before you started drinking. And at some point not even alcohol, or some other drug will shut them down. Depression is just a drug as well and you are addicted to it. And like any other addiction you can just fight it, by really trying your hardest. And that is to occupy yourself, so you can't even think in that direction. Find something that makes your life worth living. Think of something you REALLY want. It can be anything. Even if it seems out of reach or impossible to you. Set your goal and work towards it. Use every waking hour to reach that goal. And along the way care for yourself, exercise is really good. It keeps your mind from wandering and it will make sleeping easier, so you don't stay awake surrounded by negative thoughts. Let that creative energy flow into something positive. Stop focussing on what you can't do and what is bad, that doesn't matter. What matters is the things you can do.

When you hit a wall and it stops you, work on overcoming it. Never give up."
SuicideWatch,ferj9i7,t1_ferfl1p,1579354598.0,"Music connects people all over the world, it doesn't matter where you are, you can always do it. Spend your time creating music, learn new ways to make music. And don't stop. You won't create a #1 hit your first try, or 2nd. Maybe not even your 100th try. And even if you don't think it's good, share it. Let others listen to it. You will get feedback, and maybe realize a song you would have deleted has some great potential.

SuicideWatch,ferh1yp,t3_eqfuqt,1579353759.0,"It will only get better, if you do something about it. It won't just vanish along the way. But do what you can, to make it stop. Your Kids and Wife will be very damaged, if you take your own life. They will probably end up like you, and I think you don't want this. As a parent, do your best to make your childrens life as good as you can. But to do so, you will have to get yours back together. 

To do so, ask yourself what you REALLY want. What is something you always wanted to do, but never did or never were able to? Or maybe something you can't offer your kids or your wife. Or even your childhood dream. Set it as your goal. Pursue that goal. Use your free time to work towards it. The best you can do against suicidal thoughts, is to keep yourself occupied. Supposing your Job is physically demanding but not mentally, use the time alone to do mentally challenging work. Make it something, that will bring you towards that goal. And if you can't do it because you lack the skills or the knowledge, then don't give up but learn that."

When you feel like no one in your life matters, then find people who do. Your ""friends"" aren't your friends, when they backstab you. They probably just don't suck as much as other in your view. 

Find something you really want. Your biggest childhood dream or something you want to change in the world, it can be anything. Let it be something that's hard to achieve. But don't let it be Happiness. Happiness will come along the way, without actively pursuing it. And then think of what you have to do to reach it. Use every waking hour to work towards your goal. And don't give up if it isn't easy, it shouldn't be. Take every step towards your goal, no matter how small the progress feels. Get up and fight. But don't focus on what is bad, and what you can't do. These things will only slow you down and you will never reach your goal that way. Focus on what you CAN do. And get the negativity out of your life, bad friends, bad habits, etc. Move to another city or country if you have to. Find people who are ambitious and who will support you.

And if anyone tells you you are weak, fuck them. Show them you aren't and show them you can achieve things. Because you can. And you will if you get up and work for it.

Set your goal to go there and use every waking hour to reach it. You will eventually. You have the opportunity right in front of you, grab it. It won't be easy, but that's not the goal. The goal is to do something hard and be proud of what you achieved. Then you can reach the next even higher goal.

Don't let life slow down, and don't allow yourself too much free time, always use it for something. And always keep your eyes on your goal. The more you work towards your goal, the happier you will get. And the greater will it feel to finally reach it."

But most important: Stop focussing on what you can't, there is always plents more of that, than what you can. If you focus on what you CAN do, your view of the world will change and you will be able to climb out the hole you are sitting in at the moment.

You will find Happiness, but don't wait for it to come. Get up and find it! It will come through pursuing you goal."
SuicideWatch,fer664b,t1_fer132g,1579350364.0,"Can just agree with that. Find something to pursue, set a goal. Make your life worth living. Find Motivation and inspire others. Use every waking hour to progress towards your goal. And if you fill it with other things, make sure they don't keep you from progressing. The worst things in your Life should have a neutral effect on reaching your goal at most. Set up some rules, to keep you from drifting of your path towards your goal. And never stop chasing it.

The chubby part is just like everything else in life, you have to do something about it in order to change. It's not easy but possible and you will find succes, if you work for it."
SuicideWatch,feqz5mp,t3_eqcbh7,1579347762.0,"Ask yourself what you really want to achieve. Or what you want to change about the world. It can be anything, and must not be bound to your talents or what you are good at. Just what you want. And then start pursuing it. Don't focus on the negative and what you can't do, focus on what you can. Find the positive in your life, even if it's just a dream, and feed it. It will grow and grow and eventually be way bigger than everything that is bad about your life atm.

You don't fail your classes, because you aren't good at the subjects. You fail them because you don't work on getting good at them. Everyone who gets good grades is working for it. So it is in Life, anyone who is happy and succesful, is it because he puts in his energy and works for it. Nothing is free.

Find the thing you want most in life, and put all your energy in reaching it. You have 24h a day, use all of them to reach your goal. Care for yourself, get healthy and let go of everything that holds you back. You aren't stuck in this world, you are stuck in your negativity. Get out of your rabbit hole and see the world. It isn't all sunny and beautiful, but also not all dark and cold. Don't expect anything to be easy and face your problems. Being depressed and suicidal is easy and selfish. Overcoming it is hard and needs you to care for yourself.

Anyone can be happy, and will be if they put in the effort. So can you. Work for it and show the world, what you are made of, what you can achieve. You are destined to do great. Stop letting your life go by, take the steering wheel. You are the only who can change directions. But you have to move to do so.

SuicideWatch,fequwtv,t3_eqdd6r,1579346307.0,"Everyone has mental problems. Nobody is 100% positive all the time. It's not about having those feelings, it's about how you view them. Don't focus on what is negative. Focus on what is positive, even if it seems to be far less, maybe even close to nothing. But there is something. Be true to yourself. Find the positive in you Life and feed it. Use your time to do something productive and don't do let time fly by. Think about what you really want to achieve, it can be anything. And then think what you have to reach it. Set your goal and pursue it. Use every waking hour to achieve this goal. And if things don't go your way, don't dwell on it and give up. Keep trying. It won't come fast. It will be hard. And at first you won't see anything changing, but after some time you will be able to see what progress you already made. Don't expect things to be easy. It is a challenge. But everyone can do it, and everyone who tries WILL do it. You just have to keep going. Do everything that brings your goal one step closer. And everything that keeps you from reaching it, is not worth spending time on. Shut the negativtiy out of you life and seal the door. Don't open when it knocks, no matter how tempting. 

Stop thinking about what you can't, start focussing on what you CAN do. You don't have to be especially talented at something, and you won't be very good at anything doing it the first time. You have to practice and learn. That is how you will succeed. Life isn't a sprint, it's a marathon. Don't give up, but run to the finish line. And if you can't run, then walk. The goal is not setting a world record, the goal is finishing. 

And go to therapy, if you can't do it yourself. That does help. It only doesn't when you resist it. And getting things off your chest must not be comfortable. It has to be hard. Your friends won't know what to say, neither do you. That is why you have to do it. You don't just have knowledge, you get it through experience. Nobody will think you are crazy, if you tell them this. Believing there is anyone in this world, who can't find happiness and are only able to feel like this, is straight up wrong. Anyone can find happiness and will, when they try. But nobody will get it for free, you have to work for it. But I know you can achieve it. Don't give up and get back on your feet.

SuicideWatch,feqowfy,t3_eq5g3y,1579344393.0,"I know it's hard to do, but the best way to get out of this is to push yourself and get out your way. Use your day. Get productive. Use every waking hour to become the person you want to be. If you are at a point this low, it can only go upwards. Life is a mountain, you can either climb it or give up and stay where you are. There will be a lot of rocks in your way, and the beginning will be very steep and exhausting, but when you don't stop trying you will reach the top eventually. And on top, you will never want to go back down. If you don't know how to start, just think about what you really want to achieve, from the bottom of your heart. It can be anything. But don't think you will achieve this in one week or month or even a year. It will take you a very long time to get there, but the way is worth it. Start setting up a goal, and think of what will bring you there. Focus all your energy on that. And everything that keeps you from reaching your goals, is NOT in your interest, you won't be able to avoid everything. Evaluate everything you do on how it helps you reach your goals. And no matter how much fun something is, it's probably worth stopping, even some of your favourite things. Fun is temporary and short lived, success in reaching your goal is the best feeling you can get.

Stop focussing on what you can't do or what's bad about your situation, focus on what you CAN do and what is positive. Surround yourself with people who are ambitious and motivated. Being around these people will inspire you and you will want to try your best. Invest in yourself. Spend every last cent you can afford on yourself. And if money is a short, spend your time on fixing this problem. Everyone can get wealthy, you don't need to be especially smart or talented at certain things, it's not about what you are given, it's about what you are willing to invest. The more you work, the better the outcome will be. And if nobody believes in you or supports you, then show them what you are made of.

I have been where you are, I have given up. But I have chosen to fight, I got back up. Now it is getting better and better, there are setbacks but they are only temporary and you will overcome them.

I believe in you. I support you.

Alcohol is probably the hardest to stop, not bc of being addicted but bc it's so widely spread in our society.

Next caffeine, since it just helps waking up fast.

Cannabis is the only other drug I tried which somewhat feels a bit addictive, since the high just makes you way more relaxed and reliefed. Also it's very fun to do with friends and be laughing nonstop.

Else I tried DMT, LSD, 2CB, MDMA and Psilocibin (psychedelics) which really open your eyes about yourself and the world. A psychedelic trip can be very therapeuthic and help with mental issues, but I think the feeling of ""wakefulness"" can be addictive as well.

Last are stimulants, of which I tried Methylphenidat, Adderal, Cocaine and Modafinil. Cocaine wasn't for me, it felt interesting but made me way too ""hyper"". The other 3 worked very well in countering my ADD and making me more focussed, though Adderal and Methylphenidat made me feel more distant to the things around me. Modafinil is the most recent drug I have tried and it really helps to focus and get shit done. But when you aren't working when it hits, you probably end up playing video games on it for several hours. None of these substances felt addictive to me, except Adderal, I feel like the sense of success is enhanced by it as well.

But Modafinil makes it possible to concentrate more on one thing and not being distracted by anything around you. People get more annoying, but easier to shut out I would say.

And isolation makes such thoughts worse. If people encourage such thoughts, try changing your relationship and view of them (Psychiatrists are really helpful in that). But in Isolation you are alone with your thoughts, and if they are already there they will only get worse by isolating yourself. Also Isolation can somewhat change your view on things and you feel less connected with everything, which makes acting out such thoughts only easier/less repulsive."

Otherwise ditch them and find 4 new mates. You can always find some, and I can really recommend using reddit or steam discussions to find players. It might seem hard at the beginning and you might only find one, but over time you will certainly find a team. If it's not a fixed team of 5, you can maybe accumulate a friend list full of people always looking to play in 5 man parties rather than randoms. 

And you can use the ingame feature of finding people, playing with them will certainly be better than with randoms, especially if you talk ingame or on said platforms. And maybe you will find someone to play with on a regular basis through that."

csgo,feh2v3d,t3_ep4sz3,1579108000.0,"You should probably start playing with premade parties. In CSGO teamwork and communication is key. Being in a discord/teamspeak/etc. together helps a lot. You probably will have to get used to giving infos, but with time you will learn how to do it. Watching Pros or Streamers with high ranks can give you a sense of how to communicate properly, without talking too much. Even when somebody doesnt talk, being in a team which is used to play with each other will take a lot of the random factors out of the game. The lower the rank gets, the higher the randomness of the game rises. 

If you don't have enough friends who play cs for a 5 man party, try finding people on steam discussions or reddit, there are plenty. 

In addition to that try practicing your aim and learn some grenades, it will make upranking way easier. And very important: Buy grenades and use them. From my own experience I know, at lower ranks people like to not buy grenades and if they do, they won't use them. Rather use a grenade when it's unnecessary, instead of not using it at all. 

Maybe try switching up your crosshair, viewmodel, sensitivity, etc. settings and find the ones that suit you the best. 

Last: Try to rationalize as much as you can and reflect on your own mistakes, blaming others is easy, but admitting your mistakes and thinking about them will make you better. This will get less if you have some friends who you play with on a regular basis, since you will get used to each others play style and will know how to adapt to it."

AskReddit,fegvnay,t3_ep3lzt,1579103554.0,"Edit: Important to know is that just before I started having this nightmare, I watched the Grinch for the first time and was utterly frightened by him. He used to be my biggest fear back then and I never was afraid of anything as much as of him.

After waking up at night I often couldn't sleep for 1 hour or so and then I was laying there starring into the dark. In the dark I started seeing faces and other stuff, which often transferred directly into dreams. One night I saw the Grinch standing there reaching for me with his long fingers and I wasn't able to move, then after some time being very scared the dark turned into a big room, which turned out to be the main hall of a castle. Realizing I wasn't bound to my bed anymore I started running and tried to hide from him. I eventually managed to do so and thought I was safe, so I called for my parents, who came and picked me up to go home. After coming home I somehow thought I was awake and didn't sleep anymore, so I went to the bathroom and took a bath, when suddenly green hair appeared above the shower curtain. The little space between the ceiling and the curtain widened until it was 5 or 6 meters high and there was the Grinch, who grew angel like wings and held a crossbow in his hands. This shocked me so hard I woke up (this time for real), but I was still in sleep paralysis. I started screaming for my parents until they came, they soothed me and took me to their room, but I wasn't able to sleep, so my dad stayed awake and talked the whole thing through with me, to take my fear.

A few days later the same thing happened again, but I didn't wake up there and kept on dreaming. I ran from the Grinch and tried to find my parents to save me, but they weren't in our house, so I ran outside. There I realized our house was on an island floating in the Sky. This shocked me so much I woke up again, but managed go back to sleep right after without dreaming about him.

This happened a few times, over the span of 7 or 8 years. The last time I had it I realized I was just dreaming and transferred into a lucid dream. I stopped running from the Grinch and went into my room to get my lightsaber, I then had an epic 1 on 1 lightsaber fight with him and cut him in half exactly like Obi-Wan did with Maul. After that I never dreamt of him again and lost my fear of him."
