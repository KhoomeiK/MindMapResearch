FemaleDatingStrategy,fepd4ni,t1_fepctn9,1579317578.0,The only reason I'm doing this is to experience this situation my way. At least I'd get the idea of ending it myself. And fact that he'll be around because we are a part of a friend group is why I'm focusing on this.
FemaleDatingStrategy,fepcz8m,t1_fepcrax,1579317477.0,"The only reason I want to give him that note is to make him believe that I wasn't even interested and it was just for sex and on top of it, that wasn't good either. 
How do I survive in our friend circle when he's almost always around?"
FemaleDatingStrategy,fepcope,t1_fepccq2,1579317278.0,"Yes, he's definitely a LVM. I'm gonna give him this letter and his clothes. That'd give him a reality check and he'd know I'm not somebody to mess with. Best thing is, they way I wrote it, he can't complain to any of our friends."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fepc7az,t1_fepbrwx,1579316954.0,"That's right. But this is a letter, so I think I can be deadly here. I'm not latching onto any expectations here but I do want to shatter all the confidence he got by being with a 'score' like me."
