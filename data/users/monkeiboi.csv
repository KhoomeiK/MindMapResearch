fakehistoryporn,ffy5nx1,t1_ffy2rxi,1580339026.0,"Legislation was passed some time ago by some very vocal democrats to ban certain cosmetic features on firearms that were deemed to make them more dangerous. One of these things was banning barrel shrouds. 

A barrel shroud is simply a piece of metal that slides over a barrel, to prevent a person from touching a hot barrel and burning themselves. Certain lawmakers conceived the argument that protecting firearm owners from burning themselves on hot barrels, means that they will be more likely to use the firearm to fire off lots of bullets...dangerously. 

anyhoo that law passed, some people were pissed, and one journalist went to one of the laws primary democratic sponsors and asked her if she even knew what a barrel shroud was. 

Her answer, preserved for internet infamy and mockery for the rest of all time was ""It's the shoulder thing, that goes up.""

I was trying to point you in the right direction to at least get the information you said you needed from her purse. 

As far as reclaiming the damaged personal property, you can contact the cleanup company to see if they were inventorying property as they removed it, but I highly doubt that. They typically do not. Renter's insurance *may* cover the cost of replacement items, but I don't know that for sure. 

It is more than likely that the company just removed furniture and property in the room where your mother perished, including the carpet, and loaded it all in together in a bio-hazard dumpster or refuse bin. So even if some items might have been salvageable, they probably would not be after being thrown together with other items that were more damaged. 

Like I said before I don't think this is necessarily a criminal issue, as  the company contracted to remove the property is performing a legally permitted job for the apartment complex. The complex itself has a legal right to take certain actions to protect their own property and the health and safety of their other residents. If you have evidence that your mother's property was taken by the cleanup company and not disposed of, that could be a civil issue or potentially a criminal one."
