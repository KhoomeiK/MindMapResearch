To be fair though, if it didn't hurt him so bad neither of us would care about it."
aww,ffg0xgd,t3_etavx9,1579896071.0,"Shadow like, why they always choose me? Jus stay in baby fluff stay in.

I agree that not everyone is equal because holy crap I live in a clean house in a first world country with running water and heat and my kids almost never look this clean for more than a couple seconds. I'm no where near as incredible as this woman is."

todayilearned,ffdrb69,t1_ffcrtv8,1579827016.0,Let's all bond over our cats treatment of our poor boobs. Lol
OldSchoolCool,ffb8y9i,t3_eskk2w,1579755532.0,This whole outfit/look it in style again. I'm not sure how I feel about it.
KansasCityChiefs,ffb5sj3,t3_eslc8f,1579752552.0,Love the r/youseeingthisshit double take right before he comments! I legit laughed out loud. Adorable.
aww,ffb4zxu,t1_ffb4n58,1579751948.0,"A little bit, but he doesn't have balls, so he's a bit confused, he's the only boy in the house."
aww,ffaw94o,t3_esj3bs,1579745946.0,"My cat is a boy and is obsessed with our repair guy. Anytime we get him over to fix something he takes extra (unpaid bless him) time to hang out with our cat because he loves him so much. It's bizarre, our cat doesn't care about any other person who's been to our house, not even family, but that repay guy, ooh boy, he comes running as soon as he hears his voice. I'm the only other person he does that for.... I'm kinda jealous really."
JUSTNOMIL,ffav507,t1_ffa4cgm,1579745212.0,"My Dr only uses house numbers if they say anything, you have to confirm the entire address by stating it yourself if they need to, no reason to ever say your address."
PublicFreakout,ffabohi,t1_ffa2gqd,1579731762.0,Yes.
PublicFreakout,ff9qiwb,t1_ff9dqxv,1579718757.0,"Tbf he had him in pressure points in his neck, I've seen grown giant men taken down instantly by my 5'6"" 130lbs mother grabbing them by the back of their neck that way. It fucking hurts, I asked her to show me once how it feels, and she barely out pressure on and I couldn't do anything to resist. Squeezing the way that guy did hurts like a bitch and sends your body into a robot mode that just moves limply wherever the person who has you sends you. It takes training against it to be able to resist. 

Btw my mom was a cop and learned that in training, I've only seen her do it to show off with marine brother and his friends, however she had to regularly deploy both that and the hand one she knew to take control of situations since she was usually so smol compared to the suspects.

Edit: idk why all these mma guys act like everyone who's gonna street fight are mma trained? They aren't? They are pretty real pressure points, that aren't hard to hair against if you know what's going on, but that's the point? You use them when the other guys an idiot. But okay, you're perfect and know it all!"
tifu,ff807qj,t3_es3vsf,1579662603.0,How's this popping up after a ask Reddit thread where a guy got fingered in his couples massage? I don't usually care but this one smells like bull shit
badwomensanatomy,fewdvge,t1_fevqqrx,1579408944.0,"It's normal I guess! I looked it up, people who get sexual pleasure from hitting the cervix usually have a higher pain tolerance too. So yeah."
badwomensanatomy,fev2j4f,t1_fet7lby,1579392391.0,"I tried getting one the other day (I say tried because... Well, idk I have to go to someone else and figure out what's going on) and the Dr was freaking out with how I didn't feel the pain, I could feel the pressure and everything moving about bit nothing hurt, it was kinda funny the way he was like ""you can tell me if it hurts, seriously, I'm NOT being nice trying to figure this out."" 

Idk! Anyway it doesn't hurt that much when my husband gets to my cervix and it actually makes my orgasms more intense, but he still can't go IN my cervix, that's just stupidity. I think I'm just used to it."
aww,fcneey7,t3_ei19xs,1577809997.0,I hate it.
tifu,fcne2c8,t1_fcmpm4s,1577809770.0,"My dad has one in his office for his back. Like. He literally only uses it for regular massages. He KNOWS the ""alternative"" use. He gives no shits and leaves it on full display because he thinks people are dumb."
Awwducational,fcna516,t1_fcm97k1,1577807147.0,That's actually perfect. Thank you! That seriously it's crazy though.
Awwducational,fcm8ld9,t3_ehwhfo,1577767136.0,"I wish I had a better breakdown in the relationship, like a ""as different as this is too this"" sort of thing. Otherwise, that's just super weird that they are two different kinds."
