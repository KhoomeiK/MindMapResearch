depression,fewebci,t3_eqnbva,1579409164.0,I don't know. I prefer someone who knows how it is. Been with people who don't get it and think I can just snap out of it whenever I please.
depression,feco2yr,t3_eofo27,1578978809.0,Hmmm. Genuine joy? Last time I remember having a good time without any sense of depression or anxiety was 5 or 6 years ago. Little tiny segments of joy I have are scattered over those years but I always felt depressed because of events that transpired over those years and knew it was temporary.
depression,feclobl,t3_eo8lps,1578976987.0,Or the second you are genuinely happy or comfortable suddenly it comes back 10Ã— worse and leaves you with this painful empty feeling.
depression,fdk4cur,t3_elqwy9,1578495751.0,"Lost my childhood home. Lost my father. Live hours away from my friends in a new shit environment where everyone fights. Isolated along with Dissociative Identity Disorder, shifting into different personalities constantly. Depression and anxiety were inevitable with all that shit piled against me."
depression,fdfo077,t3_el0p2p,1578366113.0,Hurts my face to smile
depression,fdfchx1,t1_fdf8dt5,1578358452.0,Appreciated. I'll keep that in mind.
depression,fdeo1aj,t1_fdenjj5,1578343055.0,Noted.
depression,fden142,t3_ekpvdz,1578342463.0,"Sometimes. But I'm fractured mentally, so I withdraw from relationships so nobody has to shoulder what I'm going through. It's a beautiful thought though. Hope you find what you are looking for."
depression,fdemgwq,t3_ekwbox,1578342132.0,Yeah. Just kinda feels like this is a permanent lifestyle. Not by choice either. Life is so deceiving.

depression,fcfbhwh,t1_fcfa63s,1577628391.0,Oh my god. I get it now. I read it again. God damn it! I can't process anything for shit. I should be the one apologizing. Sorry for that.
depression,fcf8zy9,t1_fcf8cte,1577627694.0,Sounds like you need to mind your damn business. Go and read my other posts to get an idea of my family and issues I deal with. I'm here more to vent than anything. Get the whole story instead of rolling in like an ignorant fuck huh?
depression,fcf5bd1,t3_eh2kle,1577626731.0,"I know. Unfortunately. I wasn't in the room when my dad passed. I didn't get to say goodbye. I only saw his body in a casket. He passed July 6th 2019 I know what it can feel like. I'm not going to lie to you. It can get better or it can be brutal. I still ache and cry. Lately, people posting about issues and situations I can't really engage with because if I'm being honest, it's hard to care in the state I'm in, and I don't want to lie to people, I'd rather be genuine. But your post really speaks to me. I'm sorry you have to experience this. Truly I am. It's a hell of a thing. Especially at a young age. I'm 17 and it's still hurts me. I honestly wish you the best. So sorry for your loss. ðŸ˜”"
depression,fblxsmr,t1_fblx5nb,1576973082.0,I don't have a specific artist. I just listen to whatever song I can relate and connect to.
