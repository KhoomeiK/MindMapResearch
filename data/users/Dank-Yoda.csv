AskBoys,ff3tegy,t3_e9fuz5,1579548449.0,"Rule 1. Don't hug my girlfriend and squeeze the life out of her when you do because i love her so much because the blood will shoot out of her as she says. Of course I apologized and she wasn't bothered by it because she knew I didn't know but we both were laughing at what happened almost right as it happened. I guess she had to go to the bathroom afterwards

civilairpatrol,fenfrko,t1_fen8w89,1579283737.0,"The time we made the cadet commander at the encampment (the guy who controls like 3 flights) laugh and loses his sh!t almost in tears. Keep in mind, this guy had discipline and looked extremely intimidating (I think his name was like ""Tyler j Beal C/Capt"") if that rings a bell for you, our encampment was in San Luis Obispo July 5th-12th... 

Anyways, a very competitive game of volleyball went on and everyone was serious about it the score was tied neck to neck.. and then the guy serving (keep in mind we were unaware the commander was watching us) made the loudest most drawn out high pitched moan as he hit the ball, it was a pretty good serve too... All of a sudden we ALL see the commander very suddenly turn away and we only noticed him because of the sudden movement.. we all thought ""holy sh!t were all gonna die"" until we saw him bend over laughing. We were awarded the spade on our guide on that day..





My next story is how I startled the absolute sh!t out of this tiny short girl with the rank of C/CMSgt inspecting me and my bed/locker during the last inspection of the encampment.. she was a yeller i thought it was hilarious and 'cute' because she had to look UP at me as she was screaming at me, she was around 5'0 exactly and I am a towering 6'5.. already standing at parade rest for 1½-2hours I became irritated but instead I showed zero emotion towards it and waited for the arrival of the commander and the chief.. finally they came, I told myself and the guys in my flight that if I'm inspected by the chief I'm gonna have fun with her and mess with her in a way where it's fun for me and funny for the guys but to where I can't get in trouble for it because I'm technically doing nothing wrong.. 

Low and behold! Here she was.. marching in my direction stopping right in front of me then turning in my direction facing me looking up at me and screams at me (I was never disrespectful at the encampment and was serious about making my bed/shirts/socks right but she didn't care evidently) at last, it was my turn.. I broke the look forward while standing at attention rule just to meet her eye level and very slowly with the most emotionless look on my face I stare down at her.. I didn't notice anything wrong with her at first but my flight buddy standing in front of me noticed the tone of voice change ever so slightly once I did this. 

I tried my hardest to keep a blank stare and blink as little as I can while staring at her as she's going on and on b!thing about the smallest piece of lint found on my blanket.. I was a little annoyed to say the least but I kept my blank stare.. she broke eye contact several times and it was clear to me and to everyone around her that she was uncomfortable, of course no one helped her out staff wise because I'm technically doing nothing wrong and she was the one doing the screaming.
After I got bored with the blank stare thing I very slightly change my facial expression to a very slight intimidating expression and now that I look back on this I feel a little bad for it but it was easy to turn the situation around with her being the one intimidating her with me doing almost nothing at all... Finally she wanted to end our interaction and move on to the next person so she was concluding the inspection and asked me if I understand, I couldn't resist doing it so I screamed way louder than I should have indoors ""yes chieeef!"" Looking right at her just to finish it off, poor already uncomfortable girl became startled and jolted a little with a surprised look on her face and went to the other cadet.. I was spoken to about shouting that loud indoors but it was dismissed as an ""great shoutoff"".. 


Was I a little rude? yeah a bit but she was doing her job 'too' well from the start and no one liked her which is obviously to be expected at an encampment.."

AskGirls,felmrjd,t3_epn1ca,1579225901.0,"Thanks guys! I'm so bad with talking to girls when I feel an interest towards them.. it's weird! If I'm talking to a really cute girl (online or in person) just to be a friend I'm completely fine, I don't feel awkward at all.. but when I feel a slight feeling towards them I get awkward, now obviously if I have known the person before hand as a friend I don't get the awkwardness feeling. It's more towards strangers because I don't know what they are like so.. yeah lol"

Vent,fdobpg1,t1_fdo5yv5,1578602283.0,"Oh my, that sounds awful. I'm sorry to hear that you are going through this, I know its hard to stay strong during these situations and I don't blame you, but remember that you're in charge of the relationship also. if you have expressed to him on how unhappy you feel with almost no reaction coming from him it can mean 2 things, 1. He doesn't care about about the relationship which is unfortunate or 2. He cares about it but shows no emotion towards it until later and keeping it to himself.. which unfortunately is the least possible outcome of the two. If you feel like its not worth it anymore to keep trying don't feel like you're in the wrong for ending it. Take it as you improving your wellbeing and happiness by breaking it apart. The way I feel and even use for myself is

 ""if the person you care and love for shows little to no attempt to show any of it back to you for a long period of time, why keep showing the same love and continue to look after and tend to them with no affect"" 

I (m)  was in the same situation with my ex girlfriend, a few years back. She ignored me most of the time and showed no effort on fixing it. I too have grown unhappy but I finally made my decision to end our relationship and immediately after I felt as if a giant cinder block was lifted off my chest.. sure I felt bad and was in guilt for a week after but I got to focus on myself. I became happier and more optimistic with in the next month.
