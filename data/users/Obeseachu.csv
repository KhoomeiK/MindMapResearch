UpliftingNews,ffg7nkn,t1_fffsug3,1579900219.0,"""In recent years LGBT violence has been on the rise in the United States. The biggest act of violence occurred in Orlando when Omar Manteen attacked the Pulse nightclub in the city killing 49 and wounding 53 others. This was not only the biggest attack on LGBT people but one of the biggest mass shootings in the United States history.""

73 countries say its criminal to be LGBT in general

45 countries say its criminal to be a lesbian, or a LGBT woman.

In 12 countries you can be killed for being LGBT

There is a lot more shit I could throw at you to show, that while we may be more accepting of the LGBT the hate has not stopped. Dont think they're a victim? Fuck off."

Truth isnt hate, you're completely correct on that. But what is hate is saying hateful shit like this, and making an entire sub hating on people trying to live their lives. Hate is repeating to transwomen  ""YOURE A MALE!!! ITS SCIENCE!! STOP FETISHIZING WOMEN!!! REEEE!!!""

Again, stay hateful and ignorant.

I was not saying lesbians have dicks, I was saying ""suck my dick"" is something everyone, even lesbians (shocker, I know) , says.

Uh huh.. so what you mean is if I, a gay guy, looked at a trans woman who has had top surgery, bottom surgery, is wearing make up and general women's clothing, I would be attracted to her because ""sHe mALe hUrr dUrR tRanSpHObIA""
