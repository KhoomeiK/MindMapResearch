AskReddit,fbxz9hw,t3_ef2uw3,1577204290.0,"My dad would take all the kids to drive around town to look for Santa after dinner. This is when the rest of our family would bring the gifts in and put them under the tree.

After 15 minutes he would look for a plane with flashing lights exclaiming “I see him! He looks like he’s heading for our house!” Kids believe anything, so we bought right in thinking we saw him too.

We have antique sleigh bells at the house; when we got back my uncle would be yelling “Ho Ho Ho, Merry Christmas!” out of the second story window while ringing the bells. We run through the house, see the gifts and run out the backdoor to catch a glimpse of Santa leaving - just to see that same plane flying over and giant footprints in the snow. There’s an old family video of me grinning ear to ear believing I saw him.

When my little cousin was old enough, I got to be Santa upstairs. It’s my favorite tradition, but nobody in the family is young enough to continue it at the moment. I can’t wait til i have kids old enough to experience it.

Merry Christmas ya filthy animals."
