BeAmazed,fg2vsnh,t1_fg2vkty,1580458037.0,"But doesn't the opioid epidemic stem from people turning to heroin when their prescription medications are cut? 

I thought that was the problem: overprescription of pain medications, leading to addiction, and then people turning to heroin when the prescriptions are cut, leading to overdose.

I strongly believe that people DO need these pain medications, and it is a tragedy if they have their prescriptions cut in the frenzy to solve the problem, but that does not mean that overprescription hasn't occurred."
BeAmazed,fg2v1ur,t1_fg2s9lw,1580457119.0,"I guess there's statistics to support both viewpoints. I keep seeing stuff saying that there's more deaths in the US and it's due to over-prescribing. It's certainly much, much harder to get opioids in the UK (except codeine). The idea of getting oxycodone for dental work would be considered ludicrous here.

Here's a WHO report: https://www.who.int/substance_abuse/information-sheet/en/

>  In the United States of America alone in 2016, there were an estimated 63 632 deaths due to drug overdose, which is a 21% increase from previous years. This was largely due to a rise in deaths associated with prescription opioids. This group of opioids (excluding methadone) was implicated in 19 413 deaths in the country, more than double the number in 2015. 

And a Wikipedia page on the opioid epidemic:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_epidemic_in_the_United_States

And a graph showing opioid deaths in recent years:

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/US_timeline._Opioid_deaths.jpg/1280px-US_timeline._Opioid_deaths.jpg

As for the statistic about the number of addicted people per capita being the same today as it was in 1920, bear the following in mind:

> In the U.S., the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act was passed in 1914 to control the sale and distribution of diacetylmorphine and other opioids, which allowed the drug to be prescribed and sold for medical purposes. In 1924, the United States Congress banned its sale, importation, or manufacture.

Diacetylmorphine is, of course, heroin. It was only banned in 1924."
BeAmazed,fg2rlcj,t1_fg25u3f,1580453066.0,"Then why have drug overdose rates in the US soared in recent years?


> The study found that prior to the early 2000s, Finland and Sweden had the highest levels of drug overdose mortality. Drug overdose mortality in the United States is now more than 27 times higher than in Italy and Japan, which have the lowest drug overdose death rates, and double that of Finland and Sweden, the countries with the next highest death rates.
