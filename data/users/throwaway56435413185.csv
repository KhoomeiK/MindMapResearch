Not true at all. America's life expectancy has gone down, while countries with free health care have gone up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>The U.S. and comparable countries once had similar life expectancy – in 1980, average life expectancy at birth was 73.7 years in the U.S. and 74.5 years in comparable countries. However, while the U.S. gained 4.9 years of life expectancy in the subsequent decades, comparable countries have gained an average of 7.8 years. The U.S. and most comparable countries experienced a slight decline in life expectancy in 2015. By 2016, life expectancy for these comparable countries rebounded to pre-2015 numbers, but in the U.S., such a bounce back did not occur. After averaging 78.7 years in both 2015 and 2016, U.S. life expectancy dropped again in 2017 to 78.6 years. These recent declines are the U.S.’s first decreases in life expectancy in over 20 years.

There are legal reasons for having 'multiple books' - They usually revolve around having to use different accounting methods per local laws involving assets and depreciation.

Trump's 'inaccuracies' include occupancy rates, which should be the same regardless of the local accounting laws. This would be an indication of under-reporting income, which falls into the 'not legal' category of keeping 'multiple books'.

You need two sets of information to prove the irregularities - His tax forms and his lending documents.

Umm. No.

Our system has never allowed this. What the article clearly said was that Trump would provide one set of numbers for things like occupancy rates to tax authorities (A low number, so he can claim he has to pay less taxes), and then a different number to his loan holders (A higher number, to make it look like his investors are/would be getting a good ROI).

This isn't a loophole or even creative accounting - its straight up fraud. You can't prove it with only tax forms though. You need both the tax forms and the loan forms to prove the irregularities."

>I think it depends on what state you're from. I grew up in Pennsylvania and kids were allowed to be excused from school for the [first day of deer hunting season.](https://archive.triblive.com/news/pennsylvania/start-of-pennsylvania-deer-hunting-season-an-unofficial-holiday/) Hunting is kind of a big deal there, even if you're from one of the larger cities.

&#x200B;

I'm from the midwest too, and honestly, I'm all for regulated deer hunting season. I don't hunt, but unless the deer population is culled via hunters, the deer population will be culled by the Smith family in their minivan on the way home from dinner. I'd prefer to just let the hunters have their fun - win win.

&#x200B;

>Personally, I'm for tighter regulations and even bans on certain guns. People like their hunting, though, and for some, putting up a freezer full of venison in the winter takes some of the burden off their annual food budget.

&#x200B;

You know, I have no statistics to back anything up, but not all hunters use guns. Most of the deer hunting around me is done with bows... But I'm sure that is heavily dependent on area. My area is all state park which I imagine allows only bow hunting."

Lol.

&#x200B;

If the red car was driving 'aggressively', the cop could have turned on their lights with the red car behind them and instructed them to pull over. Like a reasonable adult would.

&#x200B;

The fact is - We don't know why exactly the cop is pulling the red car over, because driving 'aggressively' is subjective and we only have a limited amount of video available here. And what the video shows, is a cop having a temper tantrum."
