PrintedCircuitBoard,ff9flbv,t3_esefq8,1579711961.0,"The ground plane is not much of a concern with something that small, just do your best and put a few vias around to connect the ground plane into missing areas if you have the space.
Same for the differential signals with those small lengths, you aren't running at fast enough speeds for a sub mm length mismatch to make any real difference. You could tweak that layout a bit in a few spots to get the differential pairs a bit closer to equal if you were really worried about it.

I would fatten up the traces to the Vdd pins though, you could fatten up all those thin traces a bit actually. The differential lines should be run right alongside each other with no ground plane between them, it'll kelp keep them properly coupled for the common-mode noise rejection."

AskElectronics,ff4f0is,t3_ere0da,1579562042.0,"This will probably get buried, but here goes.

Two reasons. One is where the fuse is located in the circuit, the other is for electrical noise suppression.

The fuse inside the unit will be located close to the Live terminal, so if it blows, power is isolated to the rest of the circuit.
This means if there is a fault to ground, the fuse will blow because it is first up in the current path and the fault is then isolated and unable to cause further problems.
If the supply was wired backwards, the fuse will not be in the current flow (as the fuse will be after the fault) so it won't blow and isolate the supply and things will burn.

The second reason is to do with EMC compliance.
There are a bunch of capacitors and inductors on the input side. You can see a black box inside, just above the caution sticker for example, this is a common-mode choke, which block interference coming in, but most importantly block it getting back out and interfering with radios and TV's and the like.  
These parts are usually connected in a more-or-less symmetrical way between Live, Neutral and Earth, but not always, so it's important to have the respective terminals connected correctly, just in case."

projectcar,feml95x,t3_epuq5u,1579261112.0,"Oooh, nice.

Here's a trick to get the boost on faster. Plumb the ABV directly into the pipe running from the supercharger to the intercooler.  
It'll snap the valve closed quicker and hold it closed longer to build more boost.  
Also, a Gen4 3SGTE throttle body should fit straight in (well it did on my smallport 4AGZE in my AE101 Levin at least), and you can ream out the down pipe with a Dremel or flap wheel as the casting necks in at the top where it meets the throttle body, you'll get a good 5mm larger diameter throttle body with this mod.  
You might have to swap the outer two wires on the idle control valve, but you'll see when you start the car if the idle goes up or down as it warms up.

I got pics of these mods if you are interested.

I went up to 11-12PSI on stock pulleys with these mods on my AE101 GTZ levin with the addition of cam gears to advance intake and retard exhaust by a couple degrees to minimise blow-through etc.

Also a water sprayer on the intercooler makes a *huge* improvement in power."

It seems to be a slightly common thing for these chargers to get stupid hot apparently.  
You can see the melty bit of Z shaped plastic poking through the PCB and the bulged capacitor in the photo.  

So I dug around through my spare parts and junk and found a 5V fan, added an 18ohm resistor inline to drop the voltage a bit in fast charge mode (9V), soldered the wires and resistor to the back of the USB port and superglued it all together. I then drilled the holes, including some in the top cap too.
