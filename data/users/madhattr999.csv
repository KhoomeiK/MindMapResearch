But yeah, there's always the possibility of people being mis-rated in QP, especially since it's a relatively new feature and some people might be just starting new roles. At the same time, I don't miss games where the 2nd tank or 2nd healer says ""f this i'll play dps and carry us since our dps are bad"".. Usually, the real problem with a ""bad"" player is that the team isn't supporting them. Whether that means not shielding against the snipers, not peeling for supports, or not healing/protecting the tanks.

Jeff's response is basically a really long ""yeah we tried that, and the experiment was interesting and valuable, but we weren't happy with the result."" As for spending money on Devs playing the game, they have always done that.

Competitiveoverwatch,fenm29i,t1_fenkorz,1579287587.0,"I edited my above post to better explain my point, but I'll repeat it here and try to explain better. Forcing enemies OUT of an area is what main tanks do. Placing a shield happens AFTER enemies have been cleared from an area (would you throw your shield behind the enemy team?). Enemies are cleared from an area by your team killing/routing them or by physically knocking them back like Hammond often does, or Rein with Charge or his Primary attack which knocks back. Winston does it more by breaking their formation and scattering them with his cleave, or he can use his ultimate to knock the whole team back. Orisa does this more by threat of force, than actual force, which is why she is more of a hybrid tank. Sigma is squishy up close, which is why he can't force the enemy out of a space. His ultimate keeps enemies in place if they survive. Even his stun works better when lobbing it far away. He simply can't take space from the enemy. And none of his abilities are suited to it, so it would take a re-design to make him a main tank.

OverwatchUniversity,feaed4n,t1_fe6n0j1,1578947627.0,"I can see both sides of this. I like to try different heroes I'm not great with sometimes, and usually I say at the start ""I'm not great at Hanzo (or whatever) and I'm trying to practice him. Apologies in advance."" Usually that is enough. I've never really had someone complain after that. At the same time, when I'm not practicing a new hero, I want to win. My group mates want to win. So I will never accept when people say ""Its QP Who Cares"". People want to win regardless of the mode they're playing. Of course, if you say you're trying to practice a new hero, I'm not going to harass you. I'll probably do my best to compliment the hero you are practicing by picking a synergistic tank/support/etc. But at the same time, if you're trying to learn Pharah, and the enemy has 2 hitscan DPS and a Dva and a Baptiste, what you should be practicing is switching to something else as quickly as possible. There is no sense practicing that scenario, because you would be switching off in a comp game. Either way, I advise letting people know you are practicing a new hero, and it will go much better for you. (And it's really hard for someone to say ""wow you're so bad"" if you start out the game with ""hey guys im so bad at Pharah.. sorry.. trying to learn her"")"

If the teams are gold, and the enemy team has a Winston, you're still going to do better as Reaper instead of Soldier if you're capable on both.

At that rank, I actually pick Mei as a counter to Widow/Hanzo because I can wall them off in a team game. And when I am dueling them in a team situation, I find my strafing good enough to win the sniping battle against Widow more often than not since they can't move much while scoped. And of course, if I can flank the Widow, Mei wins that matchup for sure. Against Hanzo, it's a bigger risk, but I move towards them while AD spamming and usually am able to freeze him and get the headshot. Of course he only needs one headshot, so it's not a sure thing.

Mccree still needs to shoot it twice before shooting Baptiste, just as before. And Mei likely only needs the one headshot, which she can do in 1.5 second or 1 second.

But for 250 HP heroes, its much harder.. You need to walk forward to get closer, but Mei and Reaper both have invulnerabilities they can use, so its a really tight window and usually they will still have 10-20 health left. I'm sure there are better Roadhogs than me who can get it more often, but you really need to land a right-click on Mei and Reaper before hooking them in order to guarantee a kill, and then it's not really a one-shot.. It's more like a skillshot + landing the hook which is also a skillshot. And requiring two shots also means it's twice as likely you don't have ammo for the second shot."

It's more relevant than any of your posts in this thread. It's about understanding the strengths and weaknesses of other characters besides the one you're currently playing. However, you've shown you can't be the least bit objective. If you're pharah and you go flanking near the ground, and you don't listen for Mccree, and he stuns you, you deserve to be killed."

* Mei slows you and has 250 health and you have no movement abilities or they're on cooldown and even if you could kill her in 1.5 seconds, she will iceblock, and then start freezing you again > Frozen > Dead

* Hears Mccrees footsteps which are as loud as Reinhardt, didn't read his flash bang in order to use deflect/blink/recall/iceblock/wraith/etc > Stunned > Dead if he hits a headshot and a body shot before you can react, or has full ammo for fan the hammer > Dead, and if he fanned, then he's defenseless after

* Saw Roadhog and didn't shoulder check and bait his hook, or walked into him when he's next to a cliff > Hooked > Dead

Again, not the point of my post. It's about the feeling of helplessness being in those situations, not their mechanical equality. The fact that you think flashbang is an infallable unstoppable win button just shows how far from reality your perception is. My original post was how Hog's hook made people feel, and you can't get over your frustration at Mccree. I went through your post history and it looks like you main Pharah, so maybe that's why. If you played Mccree and went up against Genji or Tracer or even Reaper and Mei, or if you played any of those characters either, your perspective would change. But you're clearly not willing to entertain that possibility. People who don't play a majority of the heroes always have the least objective opinion on balance, and you're no exception."

>With Mccree all you have to do is be unlucky enough to bump into him around the corner, get flashed, and get right clicked. There's nothing you can do at all.


Just because there are differences doesn't mean they aren't comparable. In fact, you just compared them. They are similar because you are putting yourself in the range of a character that is meant to stop flankers. I didn't say the mechanics are exactly the same, but the feeling of helplessness is similar when you are hooked, frozen, or stunned. If your escapes are on cooldown and you get frozen by Mei, or get dropped in a hole by Hog, or get flashed by Mccree, you have a second to contemplate your probable death, and people don't like that feeling. 

(In regard to your less relevant points about Mccree, flashbang can still be deflected, or recalled, or wraithed, or iceblocked, on reaction. And aiming the headshot on Mei is not any more difficult than fanning the hammer. I've actually found fan to sometimes be more difficult because flashbang doesn't always stop momentum. Also, there is ammo to consider.)"
