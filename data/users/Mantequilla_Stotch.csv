Then please explain CNN, ABC, MSNBC, as well as democratic politicians and all their followers and viewer base constantly blaming the white man and making everything wrong in this world about white people. 

How come when more minorities commit anti-Semitic crimes in the US than white men, the NY times only reports on when it's a white man. And how come they said the reason was because reporting the non white crimes wouldn't work toward their narrative..

Please explain why during the peaceful protests in VA for gun rights the other day, the media only showed white people and claimed it's a white supremacist event and some how forgot to show the huge minority support there. 

I can keep going...

>The only reason the idiot-in-chief is in the W.H. is because too many white voters were more concerned about having a white man back in the W.H

Exactly my point... The reason for trump being in the Whitehouse is because everyone sees Hillary as a much more cold and corrupt person. He's in the White House for the same reason he will be the first impeached president to win the election and be put in office for another term. The extreme views of the left is way too far left. No one wants all of the bs the Democratic party is offering. 

>it's always been white men who have demonized, abused, and flat-out discriminated against women and people of color throughout most of this country's history, and they got away with it until very recently.

I won't disagree, but we don't fight past mistakes by making people who weren't even part of all that bs experience the same things. What the leftist extremists wants is for white men to be subject to the same actions their ancestors committed. Make them feel what everyone else felt. That's not progress. 

Everyone has a different story. I'm a white male. My family didn't move to the us until around the prohibition. And even after they moved here they were treated like garbage for being Irish. Then when that was over everyone in my family has worked either medical or in the military until me and my brothers. And the way my grandparents treated minorities and women my entire life, I doubt any of that hate you're talking about came from them. 

So, if that's my experience, how come it's now my problem for being white that I am subject to ridicule and hate by society?

Ok let's say you budget and thrift shop and so on. Even with the variables, it's still a hell of a lot of money you could invest and usually when you invest properly you get a larger return.. meaning if you would have only invested 100k instead of 250k over that 18 year period, you're looking at much more than the what you originally invested and could most likely retire financially free."

PublicFreakout,ff2ah8t,t3_er54qf,1579498690.0,The camera man needs to be hit too. They knew what was going on and is recording it. I take that as guilty by association.
unpopularopinion,ff2aboe,t1_ff234h4,1579498542.0,I've seen plenty. I always put it out and then hold my finger against the part that was burning to make sure it's not still lit. It's never failed me. I rather feel heat and put it out fully than assume it's out and catch something on fire.
unpopularopinion,ff1ygk9,t1_ff1ptoa,1579489078.0,This is why you put it out completely. If you're a smoker I'm assuming you know what fire is.

unpopularopinion,fewp8j4,t3_eqnofr,1579417422.0,I smoke black and milds and used to smoke cigarettes. I've always prided myself with no littering. Put the cigarette or cigar out and pocket it until I can find a trash can. I also don't smoke inside or in cars and when I'm around people I walk away. If my GF or her daughter are near me I make sure they are up wind. I don't like making others suffer for my own bad habits.
unpopularopinion,fewp0cl,t1_fev9uui,1579417315.0,Same shit happens with trash cans. People throw their trash outside of them .. like WTF.. you couldn't spend the 2 extra seconds to put it in the container?
PublicFreakout,feun2ev,t1_fetdgww,1579388094.0,"Well yeah, of course. What I'm simply saying is with out the rest of the info we don't know but based off of the officers reaction and composure it is pretty clear he had not received a call like that."
PublicFreakout,fet87w2,t1_fet24to,1579372661.0,"No, you must not know much about this topic or you're purposefully using the most extreme examples in order to try to win your argument. 

Just walking around isn't suspicion of having committed or about to commit a crime. Now if you're walking around and going onto people's property, or if you're checking car handles, or if you're walking around with an Amazon package that doesn't belong to you, those are all examples of prior suspicion. If it's 3 in the morning and you're walking around a gated community that you don't live in would be also suspicious behavior. 

You can't just get stopped and detained for no reason."
