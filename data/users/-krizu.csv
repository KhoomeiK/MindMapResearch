I am not going over Tilsit again, that shit is just boring, go back read the Tilsit part through, and then come back, otherwise fuck off, I am really losing my patience here."
Nordichistorymemes,ffgmme6,t1_ffgl30b,1579909759.0,"exactly how is industry irrelevant, you yourself talked about ""developed"" country, in my mind that is closely linked to industry, and wealth of a nation/area.

You do realize that Finland did not have a government back then, we did have a ""parliament"" of sorts, but at the end of the day, ruler was still the tsar of russia, so you really cannot talk about ""Finnish government"" if you are talking about things that happened before 1918. Also, Sweden has always been a monarchy, not a democracy, there's a distinct difference between the two

Exactly how was the Finnish ""government"" one of the ""best"" when compared to the west? Most places were still monarchies, democracy as we know it today wasn't only non-exsisten, it was feared, people were killed en masse because they were championing democracy.

The thing, you call Finnish ""system of government"" is actually a local ruling administrative organ, set in it's place by the Russians, before that it was controlled by the swedes. Yes, there were at times Finns in key positions, but still controlled by others. So it was not a ""Finnish government"" Also, what political development, Finland had no political power nor any political goals or official politicians outside of those in russia, so what the hell is this ""development"" you are referring to?

All of the systems, postal, taxing etc were placed by the swedes, and controlled by them (and by Russians after 1809), if I remember correctly, the idea for a postal system came from a Finn, which was presented to the Swedish king in the 17th century, but I am not certain of that, and even if I were right, it wouldn't make any difference whatsoever,

It is true that Finland was in some fields better off than russia, mainly because of our time under the Swedish rule, but that's  completely beside the point.

""Loads of ports"",we had two main ports, Turku and Helsinki, fucking two. plus some smaller ports, also, like I already stated, we did not import any actually meaningful amounts of anything besides paper, wood and iron, so what's your point exactly?

Åland was demilitarized mostly due to a feud between Finland and Sweden, sure, it has some military importance, but that was not the main reason why it was demilitarized.

Also, to your question, I am Finnish, Half german if we are really splitting the hairs. But what the hell does it matter even if I were Russian? What difference does it make, of course if you would have some, oh I dunno biases against Russians or russia as a country, maybe then they would matter to you. But when it comes to history, one's nationality shouldn't make a difference at all."
Nordichistorymemes,ffghf9a,t1_ffgbzv6,1579906298.0,"and that is absolutely not true, where on earth did you look that up?

Russia didn't have any real problems with Sweden, and they were not fighting for land, seriously, have you seen Russia? it's absolutely fucking enormous, so why exactly would they want to invade Finland?

We have exactly zero minerals or other materials that Russia couldn't have gotten elsewhere. Our minerals are the most basic ones, iron, copper and such, and we have trees, oh boy I am sure that Russians have no trees...oh, wait, hold on.

The few things that Finland produced to Sweden and other countries were wood, paper and tar.

a direct quote from a source, link below. "" Finland struggled behind in terms of industrialization apart from the production of paper, which partially replaced the export of timber solely as a raw material towards the end of the nineteenth century.""

Other than wooden products, Finland delivered iron and tar, again sources below.

So in conclusion, Finland delivered iron, tar and wooden products such as paper. Let's compare that, to oh I don't know, maybe Belgium?

A direct quote, once again. "" For most of its history, Belgium's economy was based on the nation's manufacturing capabilities. The country was the first in continental Europe to undergo the Industrial Revolution, and through the 19th century, it was a major steel producer. Large coal deposits helped fuel the industrialization.""

So, from one statement, we know that Belgium was a large supplier of steel products, and coal. We also get a mention of industrialization, I wonder when that really took off in Belgian soil. 

Oh, it so happens that it got started around the same time as in Britain, so in the late 1700s, and by early 1800s it was really going.

Now, how about Finland, this is a subject frequently visited in \*basic school history\* around here, you should know that.

And you should also know, that like almost every major historical event, this too, started late in Finland, around 1820 is a good date to set.

A direct quote, if you please: ""The nineteenth century saw the modest beginnings of industrialization, clearly later than in Western Europe""

So, Finland's industrialization began much later than the rest of Europe, we didn't import really anything that important, nor were we really economically that important on a larger scale. So please for the love of everything wicked on this earth, tell me how was Finland ""well developed"", quote by yours truly.

Finland wasn't a backwards country by any means at the start of the 19th century, but we were not well developed at all. That whole business \*started\* around the mid 1800s.

Now to the actual bullshit of your comment. I think I have dealt with your ""Russia invaded Sweden because of land uwu"" shit enough, but once more unto to the breach, as the good ol' Shakespeare once said.

I assume you are a Finn, so here's a quote from the Wikipedia page of ""Finnish war"" the quote is in Finnish, which you should understand (deduced by your post history), but if you for some reason know enough Finnish to post, but not enough Finnish to learn, let me translate

 **Suomen sota** oli Venäjän ja Ruotsin välinen sota, joka käytiin vuosina 1808–1809 Sodan syynä oli Venäjän ja Ranskan 7. Heinäkuuta 1807 Tilsitissä solmima rauha""

""Finnish war was a war fought between the Russian empire and Sweden in 1808-1809. The cause of the war were the treaties of Tilsit, signed between Russia and France 7th of July, 1807""

Oh, what's that whining I hear, ""Wikipedia is not trustworthy"" well, in that you are quite right I'm afraid. But I was getting lazy

a few direct quotes again, "" Napoleon not only cemented his control of [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe)entral Europe but also had Russia and the truncated Prussia ally with him against his two remaining enemies, Great Britain and Sweden, triggering the Anglo-Russian and Finnish war.""

"" Similarly, Alexander promised to join the [Continental System](https://www.britannica.com/event/Continental-System) against British trade if Brittain rejected Russian mediation"" (left one link for you to study, maybe you'd learn something for once)

In your post you say, and I quote, "" Russia invaded Sweden in order to gain land since Napoleon had dealt with possible enemies of that invasion""

Please tell me what the fuck is that even supposed to mean? and what do you think now, when I have provided you with some evidence to the contrary. Of course in your biases, you will find a way to blame the Russians, but still, your thoughts, please.

I am not going to touch upon the Russian unification policy since I think I dealt with that in my last post quite well. If you have any questions regarding that, direct them to me. In any case, the unification policy was aimed to unify Russia, which Finland was a part off, every Finn was primarily a \*Russian citizen\*, not Finn, but Russian. Officially anyway.

&#x200B;

A notice for the future:

Plato once said ""wise men speak because they have something to say, fools because they have to say something""

I think this quote applies to this situation quite well, you're comment did not add anything to the matter at hand, it did not respond to my claims and questions from the last post, it didn't even react to them. You even went so far as to repeat your claim which I already answered to (the russinization part)

So, in short, from my point of view, you had nothing to say, yet you decided to open your mouth nonetheless. Please do not do that anymore, bother me when you have something to say, otherwise, shut up. Thank you.

&#x200B;

Nordichistorymemes,ffai5si,t1_ffagjdi,1579736298.0,"Except that in 1808/9, russia didn't really invade finland, they invaded sweden, (including finland), and took the latter, as was the tsars deal with napoleon.

Claiming that the unification policy by russia was discrimination against the finns is a finnish way to look at it, but when doing so, you are completely brushing off the russian point of view, (like I said, there's always two sides to historical events) for example that the unification policy was not meant to fuck with finns, that wasn't the end goal, the goal was to unify the country, which was desperarely needed at the time. 

I am also of the opinion, that taking away someone's special rights is not discrimination, taking away someone's basic rights, that others had, would be discrimination if taking away those rights was the end goal and/or not a by product.

Because honestly, why did we have those rights in the first place? They were ""promised"" to us in the middle of the invasion, mostly to prevent uprising, and because finnish rebels and guerillas had already proven that they could be a real pain in the ass, also, russians were *in a middle of an invasion*

They weren't given to us because we paid the highest taxes, or because we were the most loyal or because we provided the best troops, no, they were given to us as a political and military move, to ease the tensions that invasions always bring with them, so taking them away is not some crime agains finnish culture, it could however be considered as a ""dick move"" of sorts. But not discrimination.

Honestly, according to my information, finns didn't really deserve special rights, our workers and farmers often escaped military service, we didn't provide any outstanding resources to russia, nor did we send a lot of troops and as a cherry on top of a cake, we as a people have always been quite prone to go on a strike, even during the swedish rule. This tendency to fight back and to resist, can in some sense be seen today too, as you might have noticed by reading the newspapers."
Nordichistorymemes,ffag3jw,t1_ffaf58r,1579734936.0,"Like I said, finland had an autonomy, a special place that few other russian provinces/duchies held, revoking it or ""changing the terms"" so to speak is in my mind not discrimination in any sense, a lot of finns claim that it is, and at the time it was surely thought as discrimination, but what we often forget is that finland *was* part of russia, and we didn't really do jack shit to get the ""bonuses"" that were taken from us.

And about stalin, please tell me who he did not sent in to the gulags/siberia?

Now that I am reminded, there were tons of peasants leaving for the soviet union from finland in the twenties who faced either exectution squads or gulags, but that fate, once again, was shared by almost everybody who moved to russia at that time, not just the finns.

It should always be remembered that historical events have often at least two sides, neither of which is never the right one.

I think it's safe to bet that most nobilities saw their own poor countrymen as some sort of lesser beings or sub-humans during this time period, without considering nationalities at all

Edit: now that we're on topic about interesting subjects regarding finland and sweden, I think that the most interesting subjects about these countries are early iron age/1000ish AD in both countries (swedish kingdoms?, finnish ""tribes"" etc) and all the wars with sweden all the way from 11th century to 19th, and the numerous finnish guerillas/rebels fighting against the danes, russians and at few points, swedes too

I can *kinda* see some of the points if we're talking about karelians, but I do not see connection between turks and karelia.

To my knowledge the closest any large and organized group of finns have been to turks, is when finns were fighting against them *in the Russian army* and even then the fighting was mostly in Europe or southern Russia.

And I am not aware that Finns would have ever in history treated as ""sub-humans"" to my knowledge, swedes in 12-15th centuries thought of us as ""pagans"", which we were and later as ""harmless brutes"" which in some case was also not far from the truth.

Finns have a long history of guerilla warfare against an invading force, and of course, the invaders have painted Finnish guerillas as nasty as possible, but that's just basic propaganda

EDIT: My problem with this post is not that it depicts history wrong, because what do you really expect from a meme, but my problem is that in my mind this kind of meme reinforces this specific idea that Finns for some reason would have been mistreated throughout history, which I cannot consider being correct, our own mistreatment, for example, POV's and (partly ongoing) mistreatment of Karelians are being shadowed by memes like this.

stalker,femtd7c,t1_femsape,1579269050.0,"Granted, there's no hitscan weapons in the game, that was solely my mistake, but how does ""getting good"" solve the problem, it will not stop the AI from shooting through the bush, nor does it decrease their accuracy when doing so.

And what exactly does ""getting good"" in this situation involve, evading every single bush in the game? Or running away from a bush in a gunfight like it just turned into pseudogiant?

The answer ""get gud"" in this situation is in my mind (and this is highly subjective) extremely stupid since it doesn't resolve anything, and it is not even closely connected to the issue. 

The problem is not the difficulty, that can be adjusted and if it was a problem, then I wouldn't be playing stalker, the problem is that the game is hard in a wrong, extremely frustrating and stupid way, making it in certain situations not fun to play."

offmychest,fekeodu,t1_fejoela,1579198470.0,"that kind of listing reminds me of stalker, let me do a similar from stalker for the memes

1. everything costs a lot, want to medkit? Sure I have a medkit, for 2000 rubles of course (basic reward for radiant quest is about 4000-12000 rubles), oh you want ammo, well how bout 5000 per 15 rounds.
2. bullets hurt, bullet to the head, dead, bullet to an artery, dead in a minute, bullet to a chest, if not immediately treated, dead.
3. World hurts. Oops, did you just step one step too much to the left from the beaten path, well sucks to be you since now you are stuck in an anomaly which is tearing you a new one.
4. NPCs are actually smart, lobbing grenades, using cover, flanking and ambushing and being quiet as fuck when trying to hide. (excluding fanatics, but they are so strong that they can afford to charge you head on)
5. the terrain, again. Oops, getting shot? well, you have two options for cover, a hole filled with radioactive sludge, or a broken-down car, which is, you guessed it, radioactive.
6. medkits heal, until they do not. They do heal you, expect of course your radiation, and sometimes they might not heal at all, and they rarely stench the bleeding.
7. guns jam, hope you got some spare mags to reload and resolve the problem, cause if you don't it's an early grave for you.
8. 99% of the mutants kill you in one hit, if they get close. So by god, do not let them get close (oh and of course there has to be some invisible mutants cause fuck you that's why""

AskReddit,fecy9ml,t3_eodtd1,1578989565.0,"A more positive one, a middleschool friend (note, around here, midle School ends at 16/17)

He had originally everything going for him, had tons of friends, was very fit, played basketball, went to the gym and helped others, sure his grades weren't anything special but he was genuinely a good guy.

Not sure what happened next, but he started doing drugs, and having tons of unprotected sex, I personally tried to tell him about the consequences but he always said ""dude stop, you only live once right"", to which I often said ""yeah. But you are about to fuck up the only change you've got""

Then, out of the blue he became fiercly religious, not entirely sure what religion but I have a strong feeling that it was orthodox Christianity. He tried to do a complete 180°, but was too deep, failed badly and started doing even more drugs because he had ""failed the god"" or something.

Then we all got out of the school, he cut all ties to his former friends and dissapeared.

Until last week, I was dead certain that the guy had OD'd in some ditch somewhere but nope. I met him randomly and it turns out that he got clean in record time, got a girlfriend and moved out with her *to a high middle-class neighbourhood* he states that they have no financial troubles which leads me to believe that he is working in a rather well-paying job, though I am not sure what his girlfriend is doing."

 it was honestly epic since they weren't just charging with no cover (since AI in anomaly is sometimes rather good)  they actually advanced in cover and while some advanced, some tried to supress me with firing full auto towards the trench.
