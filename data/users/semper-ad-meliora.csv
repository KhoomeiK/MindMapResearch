succulents,fdot7i5,t3_emcsro,1578612335.0,Were you able to propagate from a single leaf? I have one that isn’t doing to well and I’ve been trying to find information on how to help it out. Do you have an ID for it?
houseplants,fdopqzl,t3_emfovt,1578610118.0,Oh that is lovely. I wish I had natural light in my bathroom to hang a pothos like this
succulents,fdf03p0,t3_el1kt8,1578350301.0,"Background: I’ve had this for a few months and it is currently in a small pot with potting soil not specifically for succulents (so with poor drainage). I’m currently in the process of trying to correctly pot all of my succulents into a well draining potting mix. It was previously in a location with not enough light as well, and I now have some grow lights that will be above it one it’s repotted. 

I’m not quite sure if the roots growing up the succulent are caused by too much humidity, or if I’m just not watering it enough. Any advice is greatly appreciated!"

proplifting,fcg410e,t1_fcg37ns,1577636328.0,Would you suggest fertilizer right when I plant them or should I wait for them to get adjusted first? I never fertilized while they were water propping because I read it can cause algae growth
wholesomememes,fc6trsg,t1_fc6brna,1577489290.0,"I think it can definitely be difficult in a relationship to find a balance between following your own passions and dreams, while also making your partner feel like a priority by giving them attention and meeting their needs. Maybe check to make sure she feels like she’s having her needs met, while also communicating why it’s important for you to have your own interests. I’m wishing you the best with everything :)"
