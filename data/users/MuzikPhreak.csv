It makes me wonder if there was some “borrowing” of Michael Connelly’s character Harry Bosch. Harry would put jazz artists (especially good, sometimes somewhat obscure to the modern listener) on his stereo and ponder over his cases. 

Connelly was first and kept that as a theme; Child dropped it. He might have seen that as an idea that had already been done.
