I don't believe that this was something he did with, say, purpose?

I think he meant everything he said and did with you. I also think he was not capable of being mature enough to backup his own feelings with actions. He went back with a woman he didn't really want, which was a poor decision at best.

It's very possible he DOES regret it and wishes it didn't happen. But someone who truly loves you and is capable of it, would not allow himself to be in that position. And now he's a father. Of a child with a woman he doesn't want.

And that's really what it comes down to, I think. His immaturity and impulsiveness is what makes him selfish.

But some solace from this, you were in a mostly great relationship. It takes two to tango. You are clearly very lovable and will find someone who will appreciate that at all times, not just when it's easy."

The reason you felt that those things he said were true could be(and likely is) that what he said was true. But this is why people are defined by their actions and not their words.

This is man who is simply fickle and not principled.  Clearly the reason he is those things is because he is selfish and impulsive.

Even IF this hadn't happened, SOMETHING would've happened, because that is the type of person he is. 

It's not your fault. You don't have bad judgment, you did nothing to cause this. He was just a bad person and hurt you, probably not maliciously,just selfishly.

You WILL find a better and amazing person to be with. Someone who can consistently make the choices and actions to back up the words and feelings that they have."
