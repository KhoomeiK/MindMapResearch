As per the accent a lot of people will initially assume I'm Irish. This is hilarious to me as I once had an Irish lad, in Edinburgh where I grew up*, incredulously tell me that I had an American accent and he didn't believe I was Scottish.

assassinscreed,ffdui2c,t3_es84l5,1579829244.0,"Just a FYI an SSD absolutely does solve it, I had minimal loading time (always less than 5-10 seconds at any point during the game) with both Unity and Syndicate."
assassinscreed,ffdu33q,t3_esgatn,1579828950.0,I got the Rebel Collection for my long flight home over Christmas and as well as it being a solid port I'm surprised at how well Assassin's Creed worked as a handheld game.
assassinscreed,ffdccet,t1_ffd9j1r,1579817868.0,I've used a Xbox gamepad on PC for probably about 10 years now (currently using a Xbox One S wireless) and only use M/KB for FPS and point and click adventure games like old 90s adventures or recently Disco Elysium.

Maybe not that exact situation but I know exactly what he was feeling when he found himself drawn to a bar.
assassinscreed,ffb9lv6,t1_ff7d714,1579756310.0,I think they did a great job at making Syndicate look like London but they didn't make it a particularly interesting place. It just feels like a normal boring city.
assassinscreed,ffb9hqz,t1_ffagtn1,1579756159.0,I'm playing through Syndicate right now and IMO the stealth is broken as you can just spam knives at everyone from a distance. Stealth Evie is completely OP.
assassinscreed,ffb94nr,t1_ff791st,1579755711.0,I recently gave Unity another chance since my PC upgrade and not only does it still look phenomenal but there's a great game in there! I definitely think the launch affected the perception of Unity in a big way. Blending into the throngs of people throughout Paris really was a culmination of what the very first Assassin's Creed game set out to do IMO. I'm now playing Syndicate for the first time and while I like it a lot it's very 'videogamey' in comparison to Unity.

explainlikeimfive,ff2grr0,t1_ff2g59j,1579505457.0,Film inherently has motion blur as part of the capture process and is inherently different from videogames which render each and every individual frame as separate. Console shooters tend to be locked 30fps. Maybe the game can run 35-40fps but it doesn't matter losing those extra frames for a motion-blur effect if it helps mask the graphics and you were going to limit the framerate anyway.
assassinscreed,ff2dil0,t1_ff2ccp4,1579501745.0,"I didn't think I would but I'm actually enjoying how grim the atmosphere in Dead Kings is, it's a much better ending/epilogue than the weird, tacked-on monologue ending of the base game."

assassinscreed,ff1j4g4,t3_er45p1,1579480026.0,"I love Black Flag but the game is probably 80% boat missions, which is a shame because it and Rogue lead really nicely into Unity story-wise.
