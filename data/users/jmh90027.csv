Most average looking people look a bit unfinished  wearing their normal suit without a tie - sort of like they left the house halfway through getting dressed. And if anything else about your outfit isn’t flawless (slightly scuffed shoes, slightly untamed hair for eg), lacking a tie makes the whole thing fall apart.

It’s not just me saying it - it’s [a pretty mainstream view from the fashion and style world](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/nov/18/alex-bilmes-suit-without-tie) 

That said, I wear a suit for work everyday and regularly go without a tie so i know why people do it. I just know id look better with the tie on!"

I totally agree that Don would certainly be interested in an Aston and would maybe take it for a test drive - but I think ultimately it would be too on the nose. At the end of the day he’s trying to play down the fact he’s a self-centred philanderer. A father of three with an Aston as his main drive screams “I’m divorced, screw my family because I wanna pick up Bond girls”."
madmen,femy55q,t3_eq06hb,1579272618.0,"Definitely not. Don was not a hipster in the 60s, which basically was the most hipster time to be alive. He was a man out of time. By the end of the show he was about 15 years out of date in terms of fashion, hairstyle, and behaviour. Yes he embraces Esalen’s meditation, mindfulness and yoga in the final ep - but only really because he’s dragged there and can’t really leave. He’d never have gone on his own accord.


I think we can safely say Don would have been a very similar guy if Mad Men were today. Appearance-wise dressing conservatively but stylishly  possibly a little expensively. A classic hair cut, nothing outlandish or attention seeking. A nicely cut dark suit if it were still appropriate for his creative job but possibly sans tie (I know, I know suits should always have a tie but executives like Don DO tend to adopt this look). 

Maybe an expensive (but still pretty subtle) watch, and a high powered but ultimately low key car (a top of the range Audi, Merc or BMW for example) would be his main concessions to ostentatiousness.

Basically [I think this is what Don would look like in 2020](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/141370875780351153/)  (maybe sans the cheesy smile and god awful shoes!)"

madmen,fegt8r3,t3_ep2837,1579102008.0,"He won a Clio for the floor polish one, which was probably the closest we got to a busting apart his  creative process when Peggy questioned how much of the ad was really his work. 

I think like so many “genuises” Don’s real talent is for ensuring his team’s work can legitimately be presented as his work. 

He uses various techniques, from overseeing the ideas process and rejecting inferior ones, to being the man in the meeting who actually stands up and does the pitch. All this makes Don the creative frontman without him actually having to ‘create’ very much at all.

I’m reminded of that scene where Don assures the Madison Square Garden guys he’ll be handling their account personally and that Kinsey wouldn’t be anywhere near it. Pretty much the next scene he’s demanding ideas from Kinsey while telling him he’ll have to keep a low profile.

But to be that guy isn’t without graft. It takes a unique talent to read rooms, to pitch well and to manage a team well enough that they don’t mind you essentially taking glory for their work. So in that sense, without Don’s “genius” SCDP would be less of a creative Titan.

Also I think Don is lucky to be at a creative led agency (much to Duck’s dismay). While outwardly he can sell that as being because he’s such a creative force, when in reality it probably has as much to do with Roger’s apathy and Bert being somewhat aloof and out of touch."

There’d been some rumours about Austen as he was an unusually close family friend, but Ancestry DNA proved what we’d often supposed.

Anyway, tracing Austen’s family tree I realised that my Austens lived remarkably close to Jane Austen’s family in and around Kent. I only had a weird hunch to go on at this point and i couldn’t initially trace my family far enough back to find our common ancestor.

However Jane  Austen’s family is fairly well documented, at least a few generations back, so I had a few ideas of who in her line I was hoping to match with. I found the potential match pretty quickly but couldn’t prove it 100%. That is until yesterday when I got hold of the church record that confirmed a marriage I needed to finish the puzzle"
