gaming,fd87pp8,t1_fd5wvsr,1578214880.0,"Not proof. I've just seen some YouTube videos and articles saying that it will be backwards compatible, but I guess it's all just speculation still.

I've not dug deep on the internet for specs etc. I'm a very casual gamer so just made this post going by what I've seen around on the Internet as I collect PS1 games, but after reading some of the replies on here it seems that it may just be a rumour, or as people have pointed out - some form of digital release of a back library."
gaming,fd4q2tp,t1_fd4fdhf,1578169973.0,"Damn I have seen rumours and read articles that said it will be completely backwards compatible. Misleading to think it could mean digital re release.

From experience that's only bought down the price of a physical copy. 

Remember when the Final Fantasy games were worth Â£40-50 each? When they got re-released in digital form they all went down in price. Same with Metal Gear Solid and a few other AAA titles that became digital."
gaming,fd4izz3,t1_fd4fvgi,1578167894.0,"Ahh no I must have been misinformed then. I've seen backwards compatability in some articles for PS5!

Guess that's why they're called rumors!"

videography,fco9aks,t1_fco5cvo,1577826674.0,"Yeah man, C stands are a must! Complete life savers! Rigging lights, gobos, anything you need. Other than coming in handy an insane amount, if you turn up on a set with extra C stands, you are literally knited a hero.

Thats cool man. That sort of work pays the bills well for sure. I think once you are in those circles, the work must come through reference pretty well yeh? 

I make msuic videos mainly. Alternative bands. 

I set up a corporate video production company this year though to also to focus more on weddings, PowerPoint presentations, literally more stuff that pays regularly. 

Any tips on that sort of stuff? Regular clients are literally the best!

I love making music videos, but the work is deffo more sporadic. Rewarding, but more by chance by checking the inbox!"
videography,fco4amm,t3_ei71nn,1577823810.0,"FCPX is very underatted. I love it. Extremely fast. No render times. Preview and scrub through footage instantly. Export fast. Workflow/layout is seemless and intuitive both on a laptop and multi screen. Amazing and easy to use plugins that blow mainstream editors and effect softwares out of the water. No crashing. I can go on. 

I feel like people give it alot of shit because it's the cheapest - yet I hear many stories of editors and directors ripping their hair out for render times and crashing issues with other software.

Davinchi resolve comes in second for its incredible colour options. You know what, not even second. It's its own thing and serves its pruporse for colour very well."
videography,fcntixe,t1_fcnt71q,1577818122.0,"No problem! Good luck with what you get! I think the key is to just put it by and maybe spend 8k or so revamping your kit. Maybe 10 C stands is excessive haha, maybe 5 is good for your new lighting kit.

Oh... And don't forget to buy sandbags! Lol

What sort of stuff do you make out of interest??"
videography,fcnsa3w,t3_ei6afs,1577817455.0,"Wow, first of all congrats on having that much savings in your account at your age. I'd invest that in a mortgage personally!

But video-wise, with 30K (English too and I'm the same age) I would:

- Buy a Sony Fs7 or somthing equivelant
- Rent a space to work from for a year
- Make sure my edit equipment is up to spec (latest Macbook Pro would suffice) 
- Pay for any website / domain fees for 2 years in advance
- Insure my equipment
- 100% buy 10 or so C stands
- 100% invest in a good lighting setup
- 100% buy lots of external SSD drives

- Honestly, then save the rest. Save it to hire in good people to enhance your productions (DoP, lighting genius, effects etc)

Even if it's a paid job and the budget doesn't allow for good people to get on board, you can cover those costs for a couple of shoots just to add at least 2 Mind-blowing videos to your reel."

residentevil,fcnmdtd,t1_fcnlegm,1577814241.0,"Yeah I guess it would be the context of the situation the character finds themself in. Though now you say it, a whole country full of Baker family people sounds fucking terrifying!!"
residentevil,fcnm2uk,t1_fcnb38k,1577814086.0,"Yes exactly! Think about infinity war and endgame. I think it would be really great to see what happened to our heroes if they lost.

RE2 was the 90s. They can go forward to today and they could cover alot of ground. Even if it wasn't as crazy as the apocalypse - Some form of the heroes losing would be refreshing and give depth to the characters.

I feel Caire was a bit too heroic in RE2 remake and didn't flinch a bit at a huge fucking mutated G. Imagine watching Chris or Sherry die in front of her by a similar threat, breaking her down and living in isolation because of it.

Epic!"
residentevil,fcnlmeq,t1_fcmz83c,1577813861.0,"Yeh I love the RE identity. How many times do you want the same thing though? Doesn't have to be the apocalypse but I think after RE3, I wouldn't want to play another similar story."
residentevil,fcnle0h,t1_fclmjop,1577813750.0,"Agreed. I think with good writing though, it would work. The game apocalypse would be so very different from the movie version.

Imagine an underground umbrella facility pillaging all the recourses from the earth to maintain control of some twisted colony. 

I think its refreshing when the hero's lose. Look at infinity war. Was great to see how the characters handled losing in endgame after all those years. 

Would be great to see how all our heroes handled that. 

Chris could be the leader of a fucking epic resistance against umbrella who now use Bows to control the whole country. Other countries could be at war with them who are not infected, giving you a chance to travel between characters and places all over the world.

Theres alot you can do without making it just another fallout or days gone."
residentevil,fcnkho1,t1_fclh1cx,1577813326.0,"Yes, I do agree with this - that's why the thought of it progressing into something bigger crossed my mind. Seems alot of people wouldnt like the virus spreading further than an isolated incident though, but you can't make every game about the same thing. You can tell woth RE7 they are going for a different take on the whole bio terrorism action hero thing. 

I dont think people are thinking outside the box enough! I wouldn't want some Generic mad max game with zombies.. They could do it well, and unique to RE."
residentevil,fcnk8e3,t1_fcm1b12,1577813211.0,"Yeah I prefer isolated incidents, but you could still have that in the new world."
residentevil,fcnk4pk,t1_fcl1nbm,1577813167.0,"True, but they already have an entire back catalogue of that."
residentevil,fcnjza0,t1_fcl5ycu,1577813101.0,I'd be down for that. You could do a really great story where the whole country is on lockdown
residentevil,fcnh9jr,t1_fcnf3sg,1577811673.0,"Oh great! I'd love to see Leon and Jill together, I've not thought about that! Or Claire and Jill would be great too.

However I hope they also don't ever go back to co-op play though. It's less scary when you're not on your own, so would be good if those interactions were cut scene and story based, with maybe 1 section when you're together. Perhaps at the end when it all kicks off. 

I also wish they would give the characters more depth and development. I only feel like i k ow Leon and Claire in the RE2 remake because of the OG games and the movies. 

Would also love to see a game set in the future with an ""Old man Leon"""
residentevil,fckvg0e,t1_fckefxf,1577734050.0,"I like that idea of 3 going into 7 events! I just don't like hallucinations much. That's in films and TV as well, I always feel its a cheap writing trick to have cool visuals without having to explain. Just like dream sequences."
residentevil,fckby7p,t1_fck9bmx,1577721874.0,"A continuation of 7, whilst bringing in the old characters does seem the best way to go. I just don't think we need another Chris game. That's 1, Veronica X, 5, 6, 7 DLC all playable as him. I'd like to pay as Claire again, but most likley won't as she has just been in RE2 remake, but she would be older in 8 which would be interesting.

Be good to bring some of the B-listers back perhaps like some have mentioned, like Rebecca or Barry. 

Playing as old man Barry would be fucking awesome."

gaming,fcjn4wk,t3_ehgqra,1577694755.0,This is amazing.
residentevil,fch2p4x,t1_fch06rq,1577646739.0,"OK interesting. Will have to check out code Veronica again. I swear I have sat and tried to complete it about 3 or 4 times though. It's the only RE game that bores the hell outta me.

Not sure if it's the style, but it always seemed very drab and grey with a story that didn't grip me. Might watch the cinematics on YouTube just for the story though.

Interesting about the umbrella folk. Is that a guess or was that confirmed?"
residentevil,fcgw3dc,t1_fcgujpn,1577644535.0,"I agree. I loved the indie vibe of 7. I'm all for that again, but would like to see it with characters we love and know. Ethan and Mia were pretty forgettable really, maybe because you don't see Ethans face, but they don't hold a candle to Chris/Claire/Leon/Jill for example.

Be cool to get a really intense, small scale horror game with Chris and Claire.

At the same time though, I don't think RE7 needed to be a numbered entry in the series."
thewalkingdead,fcdy3xu,t3_eh1ypo,1577615010.0,"I didn't know that. I worked with the lead singer of Wang Chung this year on some music videos, I'll mention it when I see him next lol."

thewalkingdead,fc61c20,t3_egaio0,1577470039.0,"9 was excellent. 

10A very slow and too much filler. Things not explained very well and characters making odd choices. I also can't wait for the whisperer stuff to be over and move on. I find the woman who plays Alpha over acts alot of her scenes. It was creepy at first but now it's sort of cringe. 

Also another thing, this season has been spoiler central. Like I feel like there's been no surprises at all. You go on YouTube and a sponsored video would be ""SIDDEQUE DIES?"" or ""DANTE IS A WHISPERER THEORY, EXPLAINED!"" or something like that. 

Even though I unfollow channels like that, these spoilers seem to pop up everywhere which sucks and spoiled alot.

Quality of season 9 was really good though. Dark and gritty, and the production value was amazing, like the storm episode. 

Don't know what happened in s10 though. The pilot was super cheesy with slow mo shots. Also the whole satellite thing was strange."
residentevil,fc5tyjk,t1_fc5ijcv,1577465825.0,"lol of course maybe I'll just wait around in the RPD until the nuke drops, but actually will have infinite amounts of time."
residentevil,fc5kgkg,t1_fc53swx,1577460015.0,"Yeah but it wasn't the same. I didn't like what they did with Kendo, with all the stuff all about his daughter. Was so depressing. He went from a classic B-Movie hillbilly doofus who called Claire ""babe"" to an intense grieving father.

I wonder why they couldn't have saved that for the guy in RE3 who actually loses his daughter on the streets at the start. It's like we are going to have the same character twice.

Or most likley, they will cut that dude like they did with alot of stuff in RE2.

The basketball court and bus section felt like an unfinished ""build your own skatepark"" from Tony hawks underground lol"

residentevil,fc3mzw5,t1_fc36rxr,1577393587.0,"Yeah my biggest disappointment was cutting the streets out. I couldn't belive it when I loaded up the game for the first time, excited to run through those iconic streets, wondering what they did with Kendos gun shop and the basket ball courts, only to find myself starting from where the demo starts."
