AskReddit,fef9kqn,t1_feclwju,1579051402.0,"I agree, I had hoped my original comment reflected that sentiment, but I'll say it clearly in case it did not. They are as valid as cis-people."
AskReddit,feclpff,t1_febs3ai,1578977008.0,"I just want to say, I appreciate reading your civilized discourse, one of which I have seen few in this subject. You are all making very interesting philosophical points, and I've learned a lot.

(I also understand that trans people don't care about the philosophy in their day-to-day, and just want to be safe and accepted.)

Edit: it all falls apart further down though, so kinda nevermind me (but still props to those who managed to discuss in a civilized manner)."
Advice,fecjek0,t3_eo51g2,1578975354.0,"I had goodbye-sex with an ex once, and I found myself done with him completely after that, so it was right for me I guess.

However, you clearly stated that you don't want to, and you should not do anything you are not comfortable with. You don't have to have sex with someone ever."
femalehairadvice,fecixqr,t3_eoc5jg,1578975036.0,"Sexy vs. very cute, and you look great with both! I'd say the darker really suits your complection though."
