When his videos portraying ACORN workers seemingly aiding a couple in criminal planning hit the 24-hour cable news cycle, the U.S. Congress quickly voted to freeze funds for the non-profit. The national controversy resulted in the non-profit also losing most of its private funding before investigations of the videos concluded no illegal activity occurred. In March 2010, ACORN was close to bankruptcy and had to close or rename most of its offices.[13] Shortly after, the California State Attorney General's Office and the US Government Accountability Office released their related investigative reports. The Attorney General's Office found that O'Keefe had misrepresented the actions of ACORN workers in California and that the workers had not broken any laws. A preliminary probe by the GAO found that ACORN had managed its federal funds appropriately.[14][15] One of the fired ACORN workers sued O'Keefe for invasion of privacy; O'Keefe issued an apology and agreed to pay $100,000 in a settlement.”"
IntellectualDarkWeb,ff9n3ii,t1_ff9m6ya,1579716454.0,"I’m on my phone, but here’s an example of them trying to make a story, doing crazy shit and getting caught. “


Starting in July 2017, Project Veritas operative Jaime Phillips attempted to infiltrate The Washington Post and other media outlets by joining networking groups related to journalism and left-leaning politics. She and a male companion attended events related to the Post, and their conversations with journalists were sometimes covertly recorded.[160]

In November 2017, The Washington Post reported that several women accused Republican Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of pursuing them while they were teenagers and he was in his 30s.[161] Later that same month, Jaime Phillips approached The Washington Post and falsely claimed that Moore had impregnated her as a teenager and that she had an abortion.[161][162] In conducting its usual fact-checking, the Post discovered multiple red flags in her story. They found a GoFundMe page in her name that said, ""I've accepted a job to work in the conservative media movement to combat the lies and deceipt [sic] of the liberal MSM."" After a Post reporter confronted her with the inconsistencies during a video-recorded interview, Phillips denied that she was working with an organization that targets journalists, and said that she no longer wanted to do the story.[161] She was seen outside Project Veritas' office in Mamaroneck, New York, with her car remaining at the office's parking lot for more than an hour.[161] O'Keefe declined to comment about the woman's apparent connection to Project Veritas.[161][162] Instead of running a story about Phillips' supposed pregnancy, the Post published an article about the attempted sting operation. The Post decided to disclose Phillips' original discussions made off the record, saying they were not obligated to keep them confidential because she had deceived them.[161]

Hours after the Post published this story, O'Keefe released a video which he claimed exposed the newspaper's liberal bias.[163] The video includes undercover footage of conversations with two Post employees, national security reporter Dan Lamothe and product director Joey Marburger.[164] These employees explained to undercover Project Veritas operatives the difference between the news reporting of the Washington Post (which calls out the Trump administration's missteps while giving ""him credit where there's credit"" due) and the Post's opinion editorials; O'Keefe said that this exposed the Washington Post's ""hidden agenda.""[163][165]

O'Keefe was criticized for his failed sting, and The Washington Post was praised. Rod Dreher of The American Conservative praised the Post and called on conservative donors to stop giving money to O'Keefe's outfit.[166] Dan McLaughlin of the conservative National Review said that O'Keefe's sting was an ""own goal"" and that O'Keefe was doing a disservice to the conservative movement;[167] Jim Geraghty of the National Review made a similar assessment.[168] Byron York of The Washington Examiner said that O'Keefe's ""idiocy"" was ""beyond boneheaded,"" and that ""O'Keefe really ought to hang it up.""[169] Ben Shapiro, the conservative editor in chief of The Daily Wire, said that the botched sting was ""horrible, both morally and effectively.""[169] Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic wrote, ""If James O'Keefe respected the right-wing populists who make up the audience of Project Veritas ... he would tell them the truth about all of the organizations that he targets. Instead, Project Veritas operates in bad faith, an attribute it demonstrated again this week in the aftermath of its bungled attempt to trick The Washington Post.""[170] Noah Rothman of the conservative magazine Commentary chastised O'Keefe for being exploitative of his audience: ""No longer are institutions like Veritas dedicated to combating ignorance in their audience. They're actively courting it.""[171]

Jonathan Chait of New York magazine said that O'Keefe, having set out prove that the Post was fake news, ended up disproving it. O'Keefe's plot collapsed because it was premised on a ludicrously false worldview, wrote Chait. ""The Washington Post does not, in fact, publish unverified accusations just because they're against Republicans."" O'Keefe's attempts to prove rampant voter fraud have failed ""because voter fraud is not rampant.""[172]"

No. They’ve used finance and lobbying to mortgage a generations future, and they should at LEAST chip in when the reckoning comes. 


This ain’t normal, and it wasn’t always like this. In 1900, robber barons paying Pinkertons to mow down disaffected workers was “the way it was” but action was taken to change it. 


The financialization of our society, where finance guys rule over our lives, is not the only way we can exist, and you only have to look back 50 years to see that. I’m down to change the rules going forward so that college isn’t a prerequisite for a good life, and schools can’t just raise prices 10% yearly AND be nonprofits AND sign kids up for 100K basketweaving degrees.

There are debt forgiveness programs but the government doesn’t honor them, disqualifying something like 99% of applicants. The laws are written in such a way that folks can never escape—-no bankruptcy, no nothing. 


It’s a catastrophe. 


So something has to be done. 


Now when the big banks get in trouble, they get bailed right out don’t they? God forbid Rich people become less rich. Too big to fail. But when some young woman wants to become a social worker, and gets her MSW, and does the work that our society needs, for low pay, while debt slowly drowns her, putting a home and a family forever out of reach, she is expected to have “made better choices”.


It ain’t fair and it ain’t the recipe for a functioning society. Hence the groundswell for college loan forgiveness.

Here’s why Rubin sux IMO:


Small issues


He’s an intellectual light-weight. I’m fine that he has a point of view (as do Maher or Rogan), but those folks rarely strawman the opposing view. They have intellectual empathy—-the ability to state your opponent’s beliefs in a manner that THEY would deem accurate. I often think that Rubin would not be able to steelman his opponent. This is big (lol).


He has the zeal of the newly converted. He was liberal (and just as light-weighted then, I’m sure). Then he talked to Larry Elder once. Now he’s just as certain as he was before, but with an entire new set of (poorly understood) positions. I know people like this. One is a plumber who started a catering biz last year, and now is instead offering to do my taxes this year. It doesn’t instill confidence. 


Big Issue


He commits the worst sin an interviewer can commit——he’s selectively uncritical.


If he talked to both sides often (and he doesn’t), and he lobbed softballs at them both, then at least he’d be consistent. He’d be Larry King, or an infomercial. 


But he has on people with some strong opinions, fringe opinions, and in some cases morally abhorrent opinions....and let’s them paint the prettiest picture they can, SO LONG AS THEYRE ANTI-SJW. He even had that anti gay guy on and let him slide without pressing, even though Rubin is gay!!! 


Sam Harris is on the Left but he presses Lefties for a living, basically.


Bill Maher had Milo, Coulter, Stephen Moore, Ralph Reed on. But he concedes them points. He also has on Michael Moore and Bernie and whoever else and he presses them, BECAUSE HE TREATS INTELLECTUAL FAIRNESS AS A VALUE AT LEAST. 


Rogan is not as informed as Maher (although he may be secretly more informed than Rubin), but goddamn he pushes back if he sees something that doesn’t make sense to him. And the time he didn’t (Twitter interview), he brought the dude right back, because integrity matters to him.


Meanwhile, Rubin will have Candace Owens on and just let her spout off about bullshit and barely/never say “but how do you rectify X with when you said Y?” Or “don’t you see that X has a point, even though you believe Y?”. If he agrees, he’s a human echo chamber and it’s exactly what no one needs, especially when the IDW is supposed to be cultivating a space for enlightened discourse.     


I’m to the Left of Peterson but I love him. I believe he’s intelligent, informed and sincere. I don’t listen to much Shapiro but I never say he’s dumb—he’s sharp, and I’m sure if the cosmic referee were to pull us aside he’d tell me that I’m right on some issues but that Shapiro is right on others. He’s too sharp for that not to be the case although we mostly disagree. 


But Rubin is nothing like them. He’s somewhere between Dennis Prager and Kellyanne Conway——ideologically possessed and straight up fucking disingenuous. I don’t know the percentages of each but his track record is clear as day——he’s in the bag, and that’s not what the IDW is supposed to be. He’s bad for you."

TL;DR I’ve been to some American cities—-they overlap but they vary enough that it matters, and you only realize what you take for granted when you’re in a city that lacks that thing.

It ain’t there.


My initial point is that it is conservatives that steer clear (or abandon modern American conservatism), not that they are trying in big numbers and being excluded.

The blind spots I’m talking about are logical blind spots. These are the things unveiled by his morally repugnant questions (“is it wrong 2 adult siblings have a consensual sexual relationship, if they’re sterile and even afterwards agree that it was good?” For example—-there’s no logical argument against it but many people just say no). 


The blind spots you’re talking about are understanding the intuitions of others. On that we both agree: conservatives are sensitive to all and therefore have some ability to understand other’s position on all 5. 


So, conservatives are better at understanding the moral intuitions of others. BUT they’re also susceptible to more logically spurious arguments because each of those intuitions can be harnessed towards illogical conclusions."

Your “both sides must be equal” is enlightened centrism—-the intuition that someone who’s TRULY enlightened knows that both sides are the same.

slatestarcodex,fczgc37,t1_fczciq6,1578100635.0,"One of the rare metrics that novice wars can evaluate is “is my song as loud as the others on the radio?”. This means that, as a producer/engineer, I’m in a bind: I can do what I know is best and get it as loud as possible without degrading quality or dynamics, or I can get it loud AF and the artist will be happy with something that’s bad for them. This is the same thing doctors face when patients want them to prescribe antibiotics for viral infections, and of course many do (prescribe useless antibiotics to stupid happy moms and put a brick wall limiter on a master on a -10 threshold for happy stupid musicians). 


I never do, and of course I’m costing myself, but I’m one of those people that let’s principle interfere with profit.


Modern platforms are helping deescalate the loudness war by equalizing what they play digitally, so that all songs have the same volume when played on Spotify or whatever, and that helps stop the arms race. I think the worst is behind us.

IntellectualDarkWeb,fcyteqq,t1_fcyqm7w,1578086685.0,"So I read the book and I know about the moral pillars as instincts. And I think it’s a brilliant insight that’s useful.


But let’s keep in mind what that insight is: 


1. humans have moral intuitions that are not rooted in logic. They are not “right”, but they are what feels right. And it is in that sense that these beliefs are particularly incoherent—-they are illogical but they are designed to appeal to moral intuitions. And yes, conservatives tend to be sensitive to all of them whereas liberals only 2-3, but if you think about it, this is why conservatives have gathered a larger set of logically incoherent but inviolable moral rules.


2. Humans are prewired not hardwired. So How things are framed makes a big difference. You could easily imagine a world where liberals are pro life (save the babies!) and conservatives are pro choice (freedom! Ayn Rand!). So these positions aren’t predestined even if humans’ orientations are.


The last 30 years of American conservatism has been increasingly authoritarian, increasingly anti intellectual, increasingly tribal. This is why George Will and Bill Krystal haven’t moved to the Left at all and yet they’re out of touch with the present GOP. And this is why evangelical Christians are very supportive of the most dishonest, vulgar, least christ-like President imaginable. 


I know this sets off alarms for those who are susceptible-to the fallacy of moderation, but when the evidence is what it is, “enlightened centrism” is unreasonable. 


So again, I 100% agree that the social sciences are populated by the Left, AND I agree that intellectual diversity would be better. But I think it’s clear that the right doesn’t generate psychologists for the same reason it doesn’t generate Imams——it’s openly against what it stands for, and you can’t really be both a loyal red tribe member and a candid academic and scholar of social psychology."

IntellectualDarkWeb,fcy4qb8,t1_fcy0gs5,1578074752.0,"The question is: why are so few American social scientists conservatives?


The answer is, at least in large part, that social conservatism in America is not the name of a philosophy, but the name of a tribe. That tribe is very zealous and insular, and it doesn’t like academia. So you can either be an academic or be in their tribe but it’s hard to be both. 


This says nothing about whether impassioned rhetoric should be scrutinized—-and in fact it should. But scrutiny runs counter to the values of the red tribe—-it has long preferred deference to authority and loyalty but recently these are virtually all-consuming. Look how Lindsey Graham 180’s I’m issue after issue——he’s expected to defer. Look how Trump can change the entire platform in a week——the dominant philosophy is “follow the leader”. 


Can you be a prominent red tribe atheist? A prominent red tribe pro choicer? A prominent red triber who pushes back on Trump directly? Not really. 


So you can’t be a legit social scientist, and social sciences are not admired amongst the red tribe.


Therefore there are few if any from that tribe doing that work. Downvote if you want to, but there’s no conspiracy, and no glass ceiling. It’s self selected."
IntellectualDarkWeb,fcxxn99,t3_ejhqbn,1578071939.0,"Along with what others are saying: in the U.S., economically right wing means kinda what it’s always meant. Therefore psychologists can be psychologists and be economically to the right. 


But socially right wing in America is an incoherent mix of positions (guns should be unregulated because of freedom but abortion should be illegal because of the sanctity of life but locking kids in cages is good but this is first and foremost a Christian nation). There’s no “natural” way to those positions, they’re simply a set of tribal signifiers. Thus, anyone who holds them will be part of that tribe, and that tribe ALSO hates academia and the social sciences.


A conservative social scientist will be like David Frum, but can’t really be Louis Gohmert. I don’t see that changing until the red tribe does an overhaul."
slatestarcodex,fcwv3te,t3_eja460,1578038867.0,"I’ve worked as a music producer, which is a lot like a sound doctor: people come to you because they want a specific outcome, it’s very important to them, and they have no idea how to get there. There’s also a lot of tech and science to it, but a large portion is just opinion and experience—-10 different producers would do it 10 different ways.


I too experience ppl coming to me and saying “you’re great! The last guy was bleh”. When they stop coming, I assume they quit music or found someone cheaper. Couldn’t be that there’s more quality elsewhere.....


I also have a big bag of “greatest hits”—-songs with innovative or ingenious solutions, that flatter me to hear. Mediocre songs? Hey, GIGO—-I’m not a miracle worker.


Some things Scott didn’t say: you’re the oracle ppl are coming to, so you become accustomed to being the authority. This convinces you that you’re THE authority. 


You’re doing something that many people care about (most ppl like music, and everybody likes their own health), and so you’re a wizard in something that laypeople value. Perhaps the people that design portapottys have a certain genius too, but the public (wrongly?) assumes that’s easy or unimportant because they don’t value the outcome. Those thankless jobs are like an offensive lineman in football: people only notice when you fail. 


But most importantly——both by nature and nurture, to be a producer (or a Doctor) you must be the kind of person who can be decisive. Every single choice is second-guessable. As a matter of fact, that’s how I describe what a producer does: a song is just a series of choices. And I both know what the options are AND am willing to make a bunch of calls and move forward. Scott the psychiatrist is talking to people for a few minutes, comparing his observations to what an ever-changing manual says (one that’s simultaneously underwhelming and overwhelming), and his own opinions, and then making life-changing calls. Powerful psychotropic meds or just a weekly talk? Scott decides. 


Who could do that AND think they’re below average at it? 


You see this even more in surgeons, who can kill a patient with a tremble of the hand. Of course the have an unwavering belief in their own ability——they’d collapse otherwise.


So it’s not just that the system screens clients. It also screens practitioners. You can’t produce music for finicky artists, each of whom believes themselves to be the next Pop superstar, without a heaping helping of “I’m the cock of the walk, baby!”. And nothing I do can poison a client, or turn them catatonic, so a psychiatrist must find that kind of messianic belief even more essential to clocking in every day."
