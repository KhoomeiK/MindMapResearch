creepyPMs,fejg2p6,t3_ephv7j,1579172538.0,"Update: Have since reported him to police with the very little information I have and emailed them copies of all of conversations exchanged between the three of us (Him, my gf and me) and I've been informed that currently the police can not do much and has simply warned us to keep an eye out and to call the police immediately if she thinks she is in danger, as far as Im concerned his is now on their 'radar'"

niceguys,fef27mu,t1_feelms6,1579046441.0,"Hey OP here, the reasoning behind her responses and the fact she even entertained the idea of the conversation with said 'creep' was through simple politeness, much like myself i hate leaving messages on 'seen' or 'read' due to it simply being rude. I get the context of the messages can seem a bit 'creepy' but at the end of the day he complimented her and she replied respectfully and immediately informed him of her relationship status, how he acted in response is not her fault."

UPDATE: Have since been in contact with him and the police, will post further screenshots of our conversation if wanted. I appreciate all of the kind and thoughtful comments on this post, nice to know Im not alone on thinking this dude is a fucking creep"
