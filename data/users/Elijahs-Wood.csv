It’s just the most intense song that makes me go completely feral. 

You already experience the instrumentals on the soundtracks Overture but it’s just 10x better in the title song because of the added singing between Christine and The Phantom.

For anyone interested [here](https://youtu.be/jUTQarYXSSo) is the song, would recommend headphones."

It sucks your other friends went with her but if they would rather go with the toxic friend then they probably aren’t that great themselves. You’ll have new people enter your life I promise. 

A lot of people go through highs and lows. I don’t think being 100% happy *all the time* would be very normal ya know? Try your best and keep walking until you’re out of this low point.

Friends will come and go a lot through life, it can hurt a lot but sometimes you can’t control the situation and you have to let go.

You wouldn’t be clingy for bringing this up to them more than once. You’re hurt and upset. As long as you’re honest and up front with them then that’s what matters. If they still don’t give any concrete answers then it might be time to start letting go. 

You will make new friends and have other relationships with people. It’ll feel awful for a while when you let old friends go their separate ways but it opens so many doors for new people to come into your life. 


I just hope you’re okay and know that some people will be temporary in your life and that’s just how it is sometimes. But there’s also people who will be there for a long ass time and it’s worth the wait for those people to enter your life.
