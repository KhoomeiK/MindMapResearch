 with his wife?


So a guy and his wife are relaxing, watching a documentary on the Psychology and Effects of Opposing Emotions on the Human Brain. 

At the end of it, he turns to his wife, ""Well that's just bullshit. There's no way you can tell me that I can be red hot angry, and happy at the same time, I bet my life and earnings on that!""

His wife replies, ""Well Bill, you've got the biggest dick outta all your friends."""

Andre the Giant? Tallest man in the world? Kid with Elephantiasis? Who the fuck knows? I don't.

But now I've thought about it."

I'm building bedrooms for my boys and the renovations to make sure they have a safe, private place to themselves is killing any chance of having any savings in my future. I'm okay with that so long as everything is done to code, they have the opportunity for good education, and they grow up not always on top of each other. I hear that personal space is doubly important for twins. I always found it to be important, period."

relationship_advice,fcwbtmd,t3_eiyhsn,1578021777.0,"My dear, sweet /u/Elad0, that woman did not deserve you. It sounds like she was raised to be a spiteful, and dangerously abusive person. I feel bad that she was raised in that environment, and I feel worse that you were raised the same and taught to tolerate it.

*You deserve better*. I'm not your mother, but I am a mother and I am so, so proud of you for recognizing that you **need** that poison out of your life. Now you just need to learn that you **deserve** much, *much* better.  Not because you lost 7 lbs, but because you deserve better as a *human being*.

Learn to love yourself as a human being, with interests and likes, and dislikes, and then begin to get involved with your likes. Start with small simple pleasures, something that gives you a little bit of peace, (eg reading, or newspaper soduko, crosswords, meditating, walking?), then move onto something that takes a bit of learning, skill building, supplies (eg painting, sketching, jogging, guitar, cooking, gaming?). Learn to let yourself enjoy your company and your hobby. You'll find that once you like yourself, you will begin to respect yourself. Healthy habits will become a byproduct of that respect that you most likely will want to encourage, and will start following naturally because, hell, why not? You deserve it. üòä"

Your wife needs your support and empathy right now, and some professional help. Talk to her gently, and ask if she would like to see the family doctor. There is *no shame in asking for, and receiving help*. Let her know this.

NTA for letting your daughter know how much love you have for her. Somewhat of an ass for calling an equating your wife to an irrational 3 year old."
