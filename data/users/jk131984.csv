gaybros,feovauy,t3_eq239h,1579306185.0,"My best friend at the time was working with his flatmate. My friend wanted to go out to town and asked if his work mate could come along. She asked if she could bring her flatmate (my now husband).

Went out to town, had a fun night but didn't have any real desire to ask him on a date (I was still relatively recently out of the closet, internal homophobia). We hung out a few times, got to know him better. 

One thing led to another and about a month goes by and we have sex, date for a couple of weeks then break up because he wasn't ready for a relationship. 
Still hung out as part of the same friend group, was a bit hostile for a while then were talked it out, ended up being flatmates and FWB for a while. 

I wanted more/a relationship so started looking at online dating, went on a couple dates and he finally manned up and said he was ready. 

10 years later we were married (on the same date we met) and have been married 18 months or so. 

What's it like being married?
- Similar to what I saw with my parents growing up and friends (same sex and straight) who are married. 
- We do lots of things together, but still have our own hobbies/interests.
- one big advantage is that we are similar size so we can easily borrow each other's clothes, doubles your available wardrobe for free hahahahaha."

AskGayMen,fee8ge5,t1_fee2fgi,1579028552.0,"Good luck with that, in all honesty it sounds like you have already lost the fight when he broke up with you. 

You were on Grindr when I'm assuming from your post you were in a monogamous relationship. You say it was for a ""conversation"" but he likely will have a hard time believing you in future because most people don't use Grindr for conversions. 

If you try and win him back straight away there is a good chance you will push him further away. You need to reflect on what you did, what he did and whether you were compatible.

Now I'm not saying there is an absolute 0% chance of getting back together because we can only see your post here without your now ex-BFs context, but the likelihood of getting back together with an ex is low in general."

Friend was out cold, FWB and I were both a bit horny so we started playing around. Ended up fucking on the couch while friend was on the bed asleep. I know he was asleep because I was getting pounded from behind while looking directly at his face and he never moved or flinched. Was hot AF."

Spent most of my 20s in a debt spiral, being really concerned about being ""straight passing"" and getting validation when people didn't realise I was gay.

It is the piece of skin on the underside of the glans/head that connects the shaft to your foreskin. The connection is in the notch of the ""arrowhead"" on the underside. 

It is what stops you from rolling your foreskin all the way back.
You also have a second one connecting the tongue to the mouth."

Mine at least wasn't even a fap that first did it,  but for the 1-2 months between damaging it and getting surgery had to fap really gently otherwise it would rip (did several times) and bjs were off limits too (After one incident of bleeding in my now husbands mouth)."
unpopularopinion,fdnojvq,t1_fdmsw9m,1578589986.0,"I'll preface this by saying I live in NZ so not sure if costs are similar. Total was around $10-12k from memory, mostly paying for the anesthesiologist and surgeon. Because I had private insurance it cost $200-300 as my co pay for the procedure. 

Had dissolving stitches in. It was 2 weeks with no ""using"" it, either solo or multiplayer. 

I got painkillers for after surgery but barely used them, was just a bit swollen for a few days. After surgery and stitches were out it was better than ever down there as the foreskin is now a lot easier to move around."
unpopularopinion,fdmrcgo,t1_fdmetzo,1578561966.0,"I ripped my frenulum two years ago, not doing anything fun, just pulling the foreskin down while cleaning. Kept ripping it again and again, everytime it got tighter until it got too bad and I needed you do something about it.

gaymers,fdkj44z,t3_eltb6v,1578504808.0,"My city (Auckland) isn't big enough to have a gay specific venue like that, but there is at least two barcades.

Archie bros which is massive, with bumper cars, bowling,  tons of arcade games and a bar. It is more child friendly (at least till 8pm).
The other one is called Save Ferris (I love the name) and is on a smaller scale.
There is a couple board game cafes as well and a company called mighty ape (online retailer, similar to Amazon 10+ years ago) that does board game and card game tournaments regularly. 

It would be awesome to have something more LGBTI specific, but we don't have a bit enough population base for it to be a viable business."

AskGayMen,fdaeia6,t3_ek7pqw,1578245197.0,"At 22 I:
- left the Navy (voluntarily) as I had a bad episode of f2f fucked up in the headitis, threatened self harm, got medically downgraded and lost a few friends after coming out.
- came out. Technically was 21 at the time, but didn't start stepping that it was real until 22. Didn't come out to my family till 27.
- Got into my first relationship which lasted 2 whole  weeks. 
- had no job or career prospects after leaving the Navy and worked as a dishwasher while looking for a job. 
- managed to find a ""real"" job once the cafe cut my hours.
- smoked around a pack a day of cigarettes.
- lived in a nice house with lots of flatmates/roommates.

At the time I knew people who ""had their shit together"" but had lots of problems in one or more facets of their lives and I knew people who were floundering. I also knew purple won were making close to six figure incomes. 

Thirteen years later and life can still be a struggle but I own my own house, got married in 2018 (to the same guy I dated briefly when I was 22) and have a career that is financially rewarding but I feel ""meh"" about. 

At 22 (or any age) there are good and bad things that are going to happen, people are all on their own path.
Their path may look like it is further ahead or behind your progress but you only see part of their lives that they want people to see. 

So stop comparing yourself to others (it is hard,  I sometimes still do), find what is good in your life, continue doing that and find what you want to change in your life and focus your energies on  trying to improve them without getting dragged down by them. 

Sorry for the wall of text.  Tl;Dr version is don't compare yourself to others, they only show the part of themselves they want others to see and hide the bad (esp on social media). Find happiness from the good things in your life and work to change the parts you don't like."

ChoosingBeggars,fcymkov,t1_fcxinpz,1578082810.0,"Damn, that sounds generous AF.

The only benefits we got while serving (NZ Navy) was if you were a couple you could potentially get Navy housing (Air Force and Army had similar) which was cheap prices. You could get that for seven years, after which you had to move out.
The idea was that you used the money you weren't paying in rent to save for a deposit. In reality most people just used it to pay for more booze, flash cars, new tv, etc...

Generally you either had Navy people shacking up with other Navy people or their partner worked a normal job. No real Navy wives as you couldn't afford it. 
To be fair it might have been slightly more like what you described at our main Army bases as they are out in the middle of nowhere and life is more defined by the base."
