We are because you’re creating mental gymnastics to justify bad writing. There’s such a thing as ‘mischaracterization’ and outright ‘character assassination’ otherwise half the fanbase wouldn’t have had an obvious issue accepting Lukes characterization in TLJ even years later. This is like writing Superman but 30s years later he suddenly doesn't mind watching children die in front of him and doing nothing to save them. People would have a hard time accepting that sort of characterization as well."

It all felt premeditated. Also why is Luke Skywalkers gut reaction to kill his nephew? This was not his gut reaction when he encountered a violent mass murderer Vader it was that he could save his soul. Also Ben was not a threat. Vader was major threat as he had a lighstaber and was actively trying to kill
him. Ben was just peacefully asleep. All Luke saw was a vision he knows and was told specifically by Yoda that visions are not reality. Luke is a master now.

Not to mention if it was just a mistake then why didn’t Luke bother to tell Ben? A soap opera misunderstanding is the entire reason he turns to the darkside? Luke should have went to Ben/Snoke and faced his failures."
boxoffice,feccdcc,t1_fecbe3o,1578970644.0,"And what’s your point the context, situation and setup are completely different. That’s why Luke in TLJ makes no sense he doesn’t “lose control“ he tip toes into his innocent nephews room with a loaded gun I mean lightsaber and points it at him and considers killing him.

If Luke had walked into a tent and ACTUALLY saw Kylo about to slaughter younglings or threaten to kill Leia and he loses control and almost kills Kylo then I might be able to buy it."

>As for Luke, I'm just gonna say it, the old cast has been kind of a drag on these films. They should have been sidelined even more than they were.

Have you seen the Cobra Kai series on Youtube? If not check it out sometime, they do an incredible job of giving Johhny/Daniel relevant arcs while also introducing a fun/interesting new generation without mindless fan-service and still respecting the old generation.  It would have been pretty easy imo with a well thought out plan and actual RESPECT for the characters."
boxoffice,feb56v6,t1_feb3pd1,1578955529.0,"Rey joining Kylo at the end would have certainly been more authentic then Luke wanting to save his mass murdering father but wanting kill his innocent nephew in his sleep. 

Regardless, in the end it would have been a cliffhanger with stakes which is much better then closing the plot thread by having Rey always making the right choice and closing the door on him for good. That just shows she's flawless, perfect and once again a Mary Sue.

Seeing her make the WRONG choice, a mistake, an actual flaw, joining him in that moment at least gives her character more dimension and room to grow in the next film from her flawed choice.

And Luke being a failure and giving up was nothing like Obi-Wan and Yoda, both of them were on a mission biding time and waiting to train Luke/Leia to fight against Vader. They didn't shut themselves off from the force or give up in anyway like Luke had. It was character assassination 101 what RJ/JJ did to Luke in the sequels."

Instead, it took the most boring and predictable choices in the end and left 9 with no plot threads to carry. It felt more like a conclusion then a middle chapter."
