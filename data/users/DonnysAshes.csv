Obviously this is an exaggeration, but the moral of the story is true. See here: https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45090.pdf

Wages for everyone outside of the top 10% have been stagnant since the late 70s. And while we've seen prices on food and technology drop in real terms, education and housing have significantly outpaced inflation. Trump's policies of cutting taxes for businesses and the wealthy will further exacerbate these issues.

But on top of that, orange man is bad. He's stacking the federal courts loyalists rather than those who were best suited for the job. He's ruined the United States' relationships with its allies. He nearly started a war with Iran for no obvious reason. He refused to divest his business interests and has been actively enriching himself on the taxpayer dime. He obstructed justice on an investigation of colluding with a foreign power to win the 2016 election.

About 83% of spending on education in the U.S. [occurs at the state and local levels](https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/fed/10facts/index.html). We also know that the U.S. has one of the [highest rates of wealth inequality among OECD countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality). We also know that wealth tends to get clumped geographically in the U.S. (I can try to source this if necessary, but I think this is pretty obvious).

I think a more precise way to word the ""I want everyone to be smarter"" statement from this post would be to say that we want to maximize the median test score per dollar spent on education. In order to do that, we would need to better understand the marginal rate of return on dollars spent on education. Once we have a reasonably good grip on that, it's theoretically quite easy to find the optimal solution.

But either way, you have to understand PETA's motivations to understand their actions. Their aim is to reduce animal suffering. They aren't distinguishing between companion animals or farm animals here because we don't have much evidence to show that companion animals have a greater capacity for suffering. So let's say a dog's quality of life is somewhat diminished by eating a strictly plant-based diet. That will likely save dozens or hundreds of animals from being brought into existence, suffering for most of that short existence, then being killed. So on the balance, you have a dog with a possibly (afaik there's no smoking gun evidence here) diminished QoL vs. hundreds of animals suffering horribly.

Don't get me wrong, the primary culprits are factory farms themselves, but PETA's pockets are small relative to the meat industry (who went so far as to hire the PR firm that previously represented big tobacco to create non-profits to spread disinformation about PETA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Organizational_Research_and_Education).

The biggest ones offered by Amazon and Kobo are 8"" and 7"", respectively. And those bigger ones are pricey, too, clocking in at $250 a pop.

But either way, you have to understand PETA's motivations to understand their actions. Their aim is to reduce animal suffering. They aren't distinguishing between companion animals or farm animals here because we don't have much evidence to show that companion animals have a greater capacity for suffering. So let's say a dog's quality of life is somewhat diminished by eating a strictly plant-based diet. That will likely save dozens or hundreds of animals from being brought into existence, suffering for most of that short existence, then being killed. So on the balance, you have a dog with a possibly (afaik there's no smoking gun evidence here) diminished QoL vs. hundreds of animals suffering horribly.

Don't get me wrong, the primary culprits are factory farms themselves, but PETA's pockets are small relative to the meat industry (who went so far as to hire the PR firm that previously represented big tobacco to create non-profits to spread disinformation about PETA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Organizational_Research_and_Education).

You maybe didn't read my whole comment?

> I suppose the rural groups would be able to support candidates from a particular party who represents their interest on a statewide level.

But no worries. I'm curious why we stop at the state-level, tho. Why not just extend this concept nationwide and have everyone vote on a single set of representatives?"
politics,fdf3rb1,t1_fdeshz7,1578352632.0,"The positive benefit is that a particular elected official is accountable to a particular group of people. In the same way that elected officials at the state level tend to represent the concerns of citizens in that geographic area. If they are elected through direct representation of the people in that geographic reason, they will be more likely to support legislation that favors the people they represent rather than trying to appeal to everyone in the state equally.

Like you said, it's similar to the electoral college, but from what I understand, the electoral college is uncontroversially a vestige from an era of slower communication, whereas districts still serve a potentially important role in helping to ensure people from geographically diverse areas are represented in government."

News travels instantly now, we no longer have need of a system that can be exploited.

I think you're conflating the argument for the electoral college with the argument for districts. I'm reasonably certain they existed to address the needs of voters based on geography, as you call out in you next graph.

> If a state is large enough and the constituents feel they need specific representation based on geographic area, let them determine that after the election rather than use it as a tool to control the results.

I'm not sure how this would work. Would the representatives of those people be accountable to all voters? Wouldn't they ultimately fight for legislation that would appeal to the widest group of voters rather than addressing the needs of those they are supposed to represent?

I love the idea of ranked-choice voting, so I'm all for having it solve this problem if possible. I suppose the rural groups would be able to support candidates from a particular party who represents their interest on a statewide level. I could get on board with that, though I do think you'd still have the issue of two states effectively gerrymandering their borders if they're controlled by the same party."
politics,fdepvc6,t1_fdenlt9,1578344125.0,That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying the states could simply redefine their borders in a way that accomplishes the same thing that redefining borders between districts does now.
