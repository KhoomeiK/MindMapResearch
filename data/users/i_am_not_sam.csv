BlackPeopleTwitter,ff4gj4y,t1_ff498uo,1579563068.0,A lot of people that will quote MLK Jr. today to pay homage to him are precisely the kind of people he was fighting against. Especially conservative politicians using his words to preach their thoughts.

politics,feijtxr,t1_fei3hug,1579140190.0,"It's not from lack of trying. Republicans rig the race so that areas that are largely African American aren't disenfranchised. Voter roll purges, ID laws, elimination of early voting, reducing polling centers, disinformation campaigns, scare tactics, lack of holidays for voting - all of these disproportionally affect minorities."

AskHistorians,fe8nkyx,t3_eo2pvr,1578928308.0,"While I can't talk about ""pride"" and who talks about their ancestry, Wikipedia puts the number of Welsh descended Americans at 0.6%. 

In the 2008 U.S. Census community survey, an estimated 1.98 million Americans had [Welsh ancestry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_people), 0.6% of the total U.S. population. This compares with a population of 3 million in Wales. However, 3.8% of Americans appear to bear a [Welsh surname](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_surnames)."

I know it's idealist bullshit but can you imagine how things things could have been if we weren't destroying their habitat and just lived side by side? There are so many intelligent species of primates and moments like these could be a normal part of life.

science,fc2vfmq,t1_fc2omte,1577375102.0,"Traditionally Hinduism doesn't pay any attention to sexuality. All scripture is centered around straight relationships but homosexuality is not forbidden. You'll even see depictions of gay sex in sculptures in temples that feature other acts of sex.

Homophobia in Hindus is a byproduct of British occupation of India and their imposition of ""Victorian"" morals."
science,fc2v70d,t1_fc2mpdu,1577374924.0,"Growling up in India putting one's arm on a friend's shoulder while walking was more common than hand holding where I spent my childhood.

But it's a big country and there are tons of variations in how affection is expressed. I also get the feeling that such displays are not as common anymore. It's funny that such a gesture was perfectly acceptable but we still have/had some pretty old fashioned views on men expressing emotions."
