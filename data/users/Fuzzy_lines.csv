I'm just pointing out that people all the time, particularly very young adults, often experiment with lifestyles like vagabonding, voluntary homelessness, permanent travel, van dwelling, beach/ski bumming, and it's almost universally derided as something that shouldn't be anything more than a crazy summer adventure at most. And people who do decide they are going to live that way indefinitely are often dismissed as, ""Having given up on life"", rather than celebrated as having found a kind of enlightenment in simple living.

But when a guy like slomo gives up a lucrative surgical practice at an advanced age, it's almost universally celebrated. I just wish we could celebrate the 19 year olds who've figured it out as well."
