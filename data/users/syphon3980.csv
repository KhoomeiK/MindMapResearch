CombatFootage,fel27kp,t1_fekyv0f,1579212461.0,"Thank you for your service!  I was 10 minutes away from becoming Army EOD, as I had been waiting for over 12 months for an opening to get into what I eventually got enlisted for (Air Force aircraft weapons tech), but my dad who was a Lt.Col was fed up, and pulled me into the army recruiting office, and was like.  Sign him up for EOD.  The Air Force recruiters clenched so hard they could crack a walnut with their sphincter. They basically apologized, and I was off to Air Force basic training 2 weeks later. (a lot more to the story, just paraphrasing)

I honestly wouldn't have been able to do the schooling though.  I was not particularly fond of academics, and would have probably just washed out into infantry, or some shit."
