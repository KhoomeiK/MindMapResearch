AmItheAsshole,ffonsbc,t3_eu8jo9,1580079676.0,"NTA   BUT do you have to go for a fitting?  Is the dress being altered ?  If so, maybe she could accompany you to the final fitting, but ask that she takes NO pictures .  I can somewhat understand her disappointment because I have 2 sons and would LOVE to go dress shopping, but I think that’s a very personal experience and the bride should decide who she wants to go with her. If not invited I would not dream of making a fuss about it."
dogs,fflqo48,t3_eu2mfc,1580042866.0,Oh gosh!! I felt the same way when I adopted a rescue! “What have I done? “ scenario.  It’s a big adjustment- weeks or months and now I wouldn’t trade him for the world. What you’re feeling is normal.
AmItheAsshole,ffieuc1,t3_etsada,1579972182.0,"NTA   Hell no don’t leave your 4 month old with the n laws, especially if you feel uncomfortable about it.  Trust your mom intuition ."
AmItheAsshole,ffg17ku,t3_etfdp5,1579896244.0,NTA  she should give the cat to her boyfriend or re home the cat
dogs,fffkl7d,t1_fff456j,1579885982.0,I don’t understand the logic behind feeding just once daily.  I know I would be hungry in the evening and it’s hard to go to sleep if you’re hungry. However I’m not an expert.
dogs,ffevf4c,t3_et5g5e,1579867212.0,I think most people feed twice daily.  I feed 3 times a day because I get up super early and we walk/hike about 5 miles per day.
dogs,ffcsbpm,t1_ffcqqk4,1579806248.0,Not sure - maybe because you are a new/different person.
dogs,ffcp3mk,t3_esubzr,1579804195.0,"Do not hit, swipe at his nose or yell at the puppy.  That’s why he’s acting aggressive.  Positive reinforcement only- redirect with a treat and he needs appropriate toys to chew on."
AmItheAsshole,ffchfps,t3_esw014,1579799533.0,NTA   At this age you need a room to yourself.  Your mother and partner will really be tied up with a new baby. Maybe you can compromise and work out a schedule where you stay full time with your dad but at least one day/week with your mom.  Have a heart to heart discussion with her. BTW your dads home sounds like heaven!
AmItheAsshole,ffatz1q,t3_eslly9,1579744436.0,NTA  this has happened to me before while walking my dog.  I did exactly what you did.  Two unknown dogs racing toward you and your dog?  A very scary unpredictable situation.  You or your dog could have been attacked/hurt.
AmItheAsshole,ffaejgq,t3_esfxc0,1579733795.0,NTA  it’s very disrespectful of them to not give a raise to the person WHO CARES FOR THEIR CHILDREN!! Just quit and find a better job.
AmItheAsshole,ff8y5rx,t3_esbrn4,1579699847.0,Kids need you in their lives more than they will EVER need money.  YWBTA
AmItheAsshole,ff7hvos,t3_erwbzw,1579649921.0,"NTA   You can ask him but it would be best to cover the couch.  I have a white couch and a black dog.  He knows to stay off the couch but sometimes he sneaks, so I throw an old bedsheet over it.  This would save you a lot of grief.  You can get slipcovers online, which is much better idea, at least while you have this roommate . (sureFit online for slipcovers - cheaper than buying a new couch in the future)"
AmItheAsshole,ff6mk10,t3_erp5se,1579630393.0,NTA  your family doesn’t want you to do yoga in a quiet place before work???’WTH?  They are TA’
AmItheAsshole,ff5w8se,t3_erq0il,1579612356.0,NTA   This is a hate crime and should be reported as such.
AmItheAsshole,ff330tn,t3_er5mf1,1579532370.0,NTA  both My sons took college classes FT and both worked PT jobs.
dogs,fezp4co,t3_er09c4,1579459900.0,I adopted a 5 year old rescue and he is wonderful.  Most shelters allow you a grace period - take him home  for awhile to make sure it’s a good fit with your family or foster him
AmItheAsshole,fey9npc,t3_eqpkz1,1579442614.0,NTA  if your wife really cared about the cat she would’ve agreed with you .
AmItheAsshole,feucgh8,t3_eqiyts,1579385274.0,NTA  gifts are returned if the wedding is canceled.  Ask for your money!$500 is a lot of money
AmItheAsshole,feu9ve6,t3_eqdd5c,1579384587.0,NTA  I’m a health care professionals and we ALWAYS ASK if the student can observe.
AmItheAsshole,feu46ts,t3_eqk9ht,1579382978.0,NTA   WTH?? Making adults share a room and a bed?  This is totally bizarre.  Stay in the hotel.  Tell your wife she’s welcome to join you or she can stay in the crazy house.
AmItheAsshole,feo74ds,t3_epxdvh,1579295987.0,NTA  lock your door!
AmItheAsshole,feo6gsb,t3_eq0u3t,1579295806.0,NTA Ithink your gf may be jealous that she doesn’t have one
AmItheAsshole,fekw8qj,t3_epeok9,1579208894.0,"NTA  it’s disrespectful towards you to give one weeks notice to be on the other side of the world for a very expensive and (unnecessary) trip.  Very poor planning on their part, and I truly believe if they wanted you in the first place you would have received notice when the rest of the wedding party did.  Just tell them you cannot get excused from work, that you are an integral part of a very important project .  Just stand up for yourself and say NO."
