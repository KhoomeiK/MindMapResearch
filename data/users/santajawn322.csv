It's helped both our careers in that we are more available and less distracted than our coworkers who have kids. We can really focus on our relationship and each other. We have hobbies that we can invest in. We sleep well. 

Unless having kids is must for both you and your partner, I'd recommend this lifestyle to anyone."

careeradvice,ffibc9g,t3_etsmuj,1579969807.0,"Unfortunately, the company won't be sympathetic to your personal saving goals. However, they do care about having a rewards package that is competitive enough to attract and retain talented people. 

Salary negotiations should be framed in those terms. Meaning, you should focus on things like:

""The typical salary for this type of work is $XX,XXX. The typical benefits package offers medical, dental, and a retirement plan at a cost of $XX. Without a retirement plan, you're effectively compensating me well below the market rate."" 

A long wait to get into a company's retirement plan is a big red flag. The only reason that they'd put it off that long would be because they can't afford it. That gives me serious concerns about the company's health and well being.

And, importantly, if they're cutting costs here, they're probably doing it in other places, too. Meaning, your annual raises might be below the rate of inflation. You may not get bonuses or bonuses might be in the form of gift cards or something."
