It is considered offensive to use that term for a trans-gender person.


#Acceptable uses of a term are:

Trans-mission: the device in your car that delivers power from the engine to the wheels.

Trans-former: a device that converts one AC (alternating current) voltage to another AC voltage.

Trans-sistor: a device that controls a flow of electrical current between collector and emitter via a smaller current being applied to the base. In the case of a MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) the terms are: source (instead of collector), drain (instead of emitter), gate (instead of base).

**And anything not relating to a persons gender transition.**

TLDR: Don't use that term to refer to transgender people, in that context it is a slur."

2. If you treat adults like children it won't stop all the suicides that result from not being able to marry or losing the love of your life. It was more of an example how since they were treated like adults they acted like adults would: i.e no fart jokes, no all around immature behavior.

3. He was deposed when he was in his 30's. He was the most popular exactly during his years of 16 - 20.

A far better example would be [Evariste Galois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois), he died at age 20 (if he lived today he wouldn't be able to drink or even smoke). The fact that a incontinent senile person with advanced dementia can buy nicotine or alcohol products, but a 19 year old prodigy who changed the world (such as [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz), the inventor of Reddit) can't is proof of a severe problem. 

If it is okay to discriminate based on age, why stop there, why not discriminate based on gender, race, ethnicity, religion? Imagine a woman went to a bar and the bartender refused to serve her since *she might* be pregnant and alcohol during pregnancies causes severe birth defects. Not allowing women to buy alcohol until menopause would decrease birth defects but we don't do it since we are not bigots, but age is a great option for senile politicians to discriminate with the ability to set any desired age limit (i.e anyone under 35 is too immature to be a president)."

Yep, Soviet capacitors are extremely reliable, and skookum as frig.

It also has the sacred Soviet  [""seal of quality""](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/State\_Quality\_Mark\_Of\_The\_USSR\_%28Black%29.svg). 

I would trust the remaining cap I have far more than some cheap capacitor I got from some sketchy Aliexpress or Ebay seller (I got it from the junk pile of a makerspace, and even then it only blew because I kept abusing it by over-volting it 150% of its rated voltage (I was trying to get the power I needed for some experiments, **it's not like I was trying to kill it**, though I was reckless in how I cared for it, it will obviously last longer with TLC than with abuse)).


I think part of the reason they are so reliable is that it is hermetically sealed (and rated to operate from deep vacuum to double atmospheric pressure, with no problems). They are also rated to withstand quite significant g-forces. In addition they also have a shelf life of 10 years (I guess how long they can wait around without use and not have a single problem, Soviets love to over-engineer things).


*going on a tangent in this paragraph* I guess if the penalty for making a pathetic device is having a (not-so friendly) meeting with the firing squad, anyone will make stuff as skookum as possible (I remember watching a Russian documentary about Soviet military technology (I think it was about an RPG) that said that one engineer that failed to make a skookum device was executed).

mildlyinteresting,fbzwhxg,t1_fbzurji,1577265386.0,Well DNA is basically just how to build someone who (mostly) looks like you. The actual data stored in your brain would not be recreated. That person who looks like you could just as easily be a murderous rapist.
Skookum,fbxudkg,t1_fbug13r,1577200757.0,"To build a good coil gun you would ideally need more than one pulse. Additionally a way to switch coils very rapidly would be required (since a coilgun needs to turn off the power when the bullet is in center of the coil, otherwise it is just a vibrator), given the massive power flowing thru the coil it will probably either be some extremely expensive transistor or some other complicated device (inductors produce high voltage if a flow of normal voltage suddenly stops, ever heard of boost converters).

A 200w lamp is not capable of withstanding the sudden pulse, given the strength that would be necessary to kill every mosquito in a 15 meter radius ( The device explodes the [largest flash tube that electronic goldmine sells](https://www.goldmine-elec-products.com/prodinfo.asp?number=G19044) ). 

Another problem is that mosquito wings are partly transparent. The area of a 15 meter radius sphere is 2827 square meters. The power required would basically turn this into a mini doomsday machine.
