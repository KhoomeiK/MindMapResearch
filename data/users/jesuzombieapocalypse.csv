Whatever, get into technicalities all you want but that theory and others like it were used and embraced heavily by communist governments because the logic of it lined up with that ideology.

Same reason I just cannot do le mis or any musical with exclusively singing dialogue. 

I like the songs to be crafted to make a point/move the narrative forward/express something important at certain moments, not shoehorned into mundane dialogue or exposition. One of the only musicals I actually like is Book of Mormon because they play heavily on musical tropes (and use them more effectively than most) while simultaneously making fun of them."

It’s not like they’re saying non-musicians can’t be there or can’t appreciate the music at all, it’s just describing a thing that musicians actually do at shows, maybe not all of them all the time but if you see someone doing that, there’s a better chance they’re a musician than if you just picked a random person at the show regardless of what they’re doing."
