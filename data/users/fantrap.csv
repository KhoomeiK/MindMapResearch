LivestreamFail,fgmadam,t1_fglowbx,1580920881.0,you should get a job where you don't have to dig ditches for 12 hours
AskReddit,fgk42iq,t1_fgjwi3z,1580857047.0,"this is the sort of stuff that makes me wonder why people are so hesitant to question concepts like free market capitalism. it's obvious that the goal of a contractor going for the most profit would aim towards 100% billable hours on its employees, but it also seems fairly apparent that that idea is terrible for their wellbeing and mental health. 

I feel pretty lucky to be able to have a contracting job that's 8 hours, no BS, leave when you're done. I feel pretty empathetic towards those who can't have that sort of deal"
news,fggo3w3,t1_fggk8ba,1580765896.0,do you think it should be mandatory to show mercy and compassion towards mass murderers?
okbuddyretard,fgcdbv3,t1_fg9n5kp,1580671558.0,what's the song tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,fg2t5ix,t1_fg259b5,1580454815.0,that’s not evil. insensitive? shocking? those both seem like better words for it. the only thing that even gets harmed is some people’s sensibilities
AskReddit,ffz9w6v,t1_ffz2pcs,1580368885.0,"huh? sales funnel just refers to the process of getting people on board to buy your product and the different pages you have to visit. 

i don’t doubt that the vast majority of those courses are not worth the “investment” but sales funnels are a legitimate thing, they’re probably just using it as a buzzword marketing thing"
AskReddit,ffy82rm,t1_ffxbphu,1580340386.0,"everyone thinks they have evidence. even flat earthers spend tons of time going over ""evidence"" that the earth is flat, and without some knowledge of how physics / geology works, it's somewhat convincing (like, you have to take a few seconds to come up with a reasonable counterargument as to why they're wrong).

they have essentially the same mindset as you, and they think their evidence comes from just a good as place as you. I think the issue is that people aren't on the same page as to what ought to qualify as evidence towards a held opinion. for some people, facebook memes are as good a source as an academic journal if you have enough of them on hand. 

mass media leads to high-level ideas with many stipulations and conditions being distilled into things that don't fit the original statement (i.e. ""in mice in a laboratory, dark chocolate once a week along with regular exercise leads to decreased rates of cancer over a 6-month period"" -> ""chocolate is healthy""), which certainly doesn't help the problem either."
DotA2,ffxiu3p,t1_ffxf6br,1580326011.0,They don't have anything to do with overwolf as a company. it's just what ad companies do when you use their services to display ads on your website or software - they gather information on what you're interested in and what pages you visit to show you ads you're more likely to click on.
DotA2,ffx8rkz,t1_ffwmsk8,1580320116.0,they personally probably only track the browser but ad companies build a profile of you which persists across platforms.
DotA2,ffvyesy,t1_ffvt598,1580277180.0,yeah! that would be it
news,ffv1u9o,t1_ffutc3a,1580253745.0,it seems like it does a better job than free market capitalism at preventing people from starving to death
DotA2,ffu6gii,t3_ev68we,1580235495.0,"its literally true though, when pubg had a free weekend pretty much every game except dota had a significant player count drop. 

also, twitch did some data science analysis of which games had shared players (ie league -> teamfight tactics) between viewers, and dota was just a solo cluster far away from everything else lmfao"
AskReddit,ffsz4i7,t1_ffq7tgy,1580198664.0,"it seems like untreated mental illness, probably drug benders too."
DotA2,ffr11z6,t3_euqrbv,1580148114.0,"immortal games are for sure broken as shit, I do not think that perma bans would change it at all. I'm literally getting matched with multiple divines when i'm rank 300 lol. perma bans only make the people who are banned at high mmr create smurfs and ruin games on their way back to the top. I get a lot more easily tilted spanish speaking players (zero english). wasn't like this a few months ago."
DotA2,ffoaes1,t1_ffo68ni,1580075696.0,"yeah probably CS, you have to do sums for algorithm complexity / analysis stuff, the identity hes using is pretty common when you're reducing it / proving statements"
LivestreamFail,ffnizvt,t1_ffmwg8p,1580066545.0,"it was a local gig lol, she's from seattle

and honestly i don't think it's that bad, but the dota community literally bullied her out of having a presence on the internet"
LifeProTips,ffknwy6,t1_ffkgsue,1580025875.0,"yeah, but python is typically easier and java might not have the libraries that make tasks like the ones being described easier though"
DotA2,ffk6oij,t1_ffk1kxo,1580017647.0,people don't play inhouse leagues because they're literally worse. i've tried reach
DotA2,ffjz1uv,t1_ffjyfdf,1580010889.0,"most people on this site have a pretty low understanding of how the game actually works. it makes sense that on the surface level a concept like ""free items that give you almost as much armor reduction as a deso"" would be game breaking and terrible.

the much greater problem at the moment that could potentially make the game unplayable is the matchmaking system and queue times, i know at least a few professional players have taken breaks from pubs recently because they're just not good."
DotA2,ffj1t84,t3_etw521,1579988252.0,"matchmaking quality for anyone above 6k is really terrible, I don't blame them for smurfing"
LivestreamFail,fffyu0e,t1_fffrtob,1579894782.0,"it's basically just having content that's palatable to most people and rewatchable, i.e. they want to go to your channel for more. an example is ""minecraft but x mod"". there's practically infinite variations and people typically want to keep viewing those videos because it's new every time, a few people who have done this have gotten crazy big viewership in only a few months"
DotA2,ffculmc,t1_ffcaz9u,1579807578.0,oh my god!! so you’re telling me they got a power spike from the strongest tier of neutral items? valve should remove them altogether and change the client back to warcraft 3
DotA2,ffcucp6,t1_ffc6ssd,1579807434.0,"yes, and one midlaner is always going to get the 2 minute dd or regen after a kill that brings them to 10% hp, or even a right click that’s high enough damage to kill them instead of leave them with 1 hp. those can make your mid win or lose their lane straight up. 

saying this like there hasn’t been a significant amount of randomness in dota able to determine the outcome of games is dumb. random roshan timers, random camp spawns, random runes, random damage."
DotA2,ffctqmp,t1_ffc77ri,1579807078.0,"the items before the last two tiers are pretty balanced and for the most part do not significantly change the outcome of a game. the items after are quite strong, and can potentially swing a game. i don’t really think it’s that complicated, and i don’t necessarily think it’s a bad thing. apex probably does need a nerf to only affect base stats or something. maybe make it toggleable like treads with lower numbers. could be cool"
LSD,ff5mjcm,t1_ff5mhe1,1579600319.0,what is it?
DotA2,ff5cbhv,t3_ernzbi,1579587064.0,your favorite hero being underpowered doesn't warrant a post complaining to everyone that you can't win games with it. go learn a different hero
iamatotalpieceofshit,ff21p4v,t1_ff1yykg,1579491421.0,yeah i'm sure that's a universal truth especially when it comes to humanitarian aid that literally saves lives
iamatotalpieceofshit,ff1xwlu,t1_ff1ubsx,1579488697.0,"that seems pretty wrong. unless the aid is fully destroyed / stockpiled / whatever, and not even a portion of it gets to the people who need it, it would seem to be the logical move to continue sending aid so that people can still use the parts that are actually distributed"
videos,ff0r8t8,t1_fezugmg,1579471548.0,">And if you get mad at the sound of a professionally played organ being played next door on a Friday evening, you're probably a grouch.

??? im losing my mind what do you think people do on friday nights"
DotA2,ff0c85w,t3_er0g7l,1579467549.0,the new system sucks really bad for high ranking players. not surprised everyone is going to smurf

all of this guy's top videos are super expensive shit. how does he afford it. is shitting himself on youtube really good money or"
LivestreamFail,ff04qul,t1_fexkn2u,1579465221.0,"they're not my articles, but people have been using psychedelics en masse since the 60s. you would think we would see negative symptoms from those people, 60 years later."
LivestreamFail,fewnyz3,t1_fewn8fj,1579416390.0,"healthy or safe in what sense? tolerance for psychedelics builds up fast; a 3g dose the day after a first 3g dose would have a much lower perceived effect (probably would seem like a big microdose):  [https://i.imgur.com/qd1QlvB.png](https://i.imgur.com/qd1QlvB.png). the doses he's taking are also nowhere near dangerous under normal circumstances, the difference between the ld50 and what he's taking is multiple orders of magnitude. for example, in LSD, people have recorded doses as high as 7000ug/100ml of blood (which is around 3500x higher than a typical dose).

my biggest concern with someone doing this would be losing a sense of normalcy, psychedelics put you in a certain state of mind that's pretty different from normal life. it could be a little stressful returning to a ""normal"" state of mind; I don't think you'd have anything like psychosis without a predisposition."
