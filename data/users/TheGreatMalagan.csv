Showerthoughts,ffi5p3o,t3_etqw2i,1579965770.0,"This is some ""first day in Psych class"" level ponderings pushing what's otherwise known as ""Psychological egoism"". Thing is, it's a lot more complicated than that and there's been so, so many arguments over the past two centuries against the circular logic of psychological egoism as an integral part of the human psyche. 

For one, it's a circular argument in which the hypothesis is the same as its conclusion: people only do things because it brings them enjoyment. Therefore, if someone does things, it's out of personal enjoyment. So, regardless of how altruistic an act may seem, it's egoistical because it was performed, and if it's performed it must be driven by personal enjoyment, which is in itself egotistical. Its base assumption is that acts are only performed out of personal enjoyment, and therefore concludes that acts are only performed out of personal enjoyment.

Feinberg put it as follows;

>""All men desire only satisfaction.""

>""Satisfaction of what?""

>""Satisfaction of their desires.""

>""Their desires for what?""

>""Their desires for satisfaction.""

>""Satisfaction of what?""

>""Their desires.""

>""For what?""

>""For satisfaction"" *—etc., ad infinitum.*


Thing is, we've so many examples of acts that are performed to no personal benefit for the self, and altruistic deeds do genuinely seem to be an evolutionary trait in humans. The love we have for our young and at times for our kin in general have driven many to sacrifice their lives for those they care about. Soldiers who jump on grenades for their brethren, or parents who take a bullet for their child. They won't live long enough to see anything positive come out of it for themselves, and they certainly have no desire to die. It has us act against our own self-interest by compelling us to do something that benefits something greater than ourselves.

Of course, the reductive nature of Psychological egoism would reduce this to, ""Yeah, but they did those acts because they 'wanted to' do it, by which you can assume that between the choice to do it and not do it, they'd chose the former. Therefore, they acted in their own self-interest by performing an act that they desired""

That sort of reductive trite is essentially an automatic gainsay that relies on the notion that biologically or psychologically compelled altruism is egotistical just by the fact that you choose it, regardless of whether or not it's in anyone's benefit, or if the person even wants to do it. It leans so hard on the notion that for an action to be performed, there must be some degree of *personal desire* ---  which really does not appear to be the case"

wow,ffakdxg,t1_ffaj8np,1579737916.0,"This is incorrect. Blizzard explained prior to the expansions release that there were two types of continuity changes we'd see in WoD: things altered by Garrosh' s arrival, and things diverging before Garrosh s arrival. But, yeah, events prior to Garrosh showing up had already diverged from our timeline. For example, Grommashs son would've been a few years old when Garrosh arrived, but Grom never had Garrosh in this timeline. A more important one Is this, too:

In our timeline, Ner'zhuls wife, Rulkan, died many years prior to the first Horde. In WoD timeline, she never died and as a result, the Legion contacted Guldan rather than Ner'zhul (in our timeline this was the opposite)

There are other small things too, like in  WoD timeline, Commander Tharbek was a member of the Warsong clan. Canonically, in our timeline, he was born of the Blackrock clan.

Blizzard acknowledged and discussed this a bit at blizzcon, if I recall, saying that while the major strokes are the same, WoD timeline is not actually our timeline


Here's an example of Blizz folk addressing things that weren't altered by Garrosh but simply were different in WoD timeline:

Last year I visited a rune stone in Sweden which said the following in Old Norse:

>""Biartr ok Bysir ok Kylfa thaeir letu raeisa staein thenna aeftir Assur, brothur sinn. Thaeisi varu Vikulfs arfar""

Now, in English, that would translate as,

>""Biartr and Bysir and Kylfa they let rise (erected) this stone after Assur, brother theirs. These were Vikulfs descendants""

The majority of the words you could've probably guessed what they meant,

""thaeir letu raeisa"" = They let rise (to mean, 'erected')

""Thaeisi varu"" = these were 

This is not only because Norse and English are both Germanic languages but also because of the Viking conquest of Great Britain and the establishment of permanent Norse settlements on the islands, which would shape Middle English into the language it became. Middle English became nearly mutually intelligible with Norse, and you still see traces of that to this day in grammatical structure and general vocabulary."

>Most european languages for example are pretty closely related in their mechanics and sometimes almost word for word. You could be fluent in French, Italian and Spanish or German, Dutch and Belgian but then you come across English and it's like... what the fuck happened here. All those other languages have similar systems to relate to so learning them, if you already know one of them, is much easier. Western European language speakers learning each others' language is like starting from the level of a toddler; but when learning English, suddenly they don't understand shit because English has none of those systems and it's like learning from baby talk again.

This is absolute trite. English is very closely related to other Germanic languages and has almost the same grammatical structure. English is closer to the Scandinavian languages than French is to Spanish. They even share *a lot* of the same vocabulary. If you already spoke Swedish, for example, then learning English would be a piece of cake since the grammar is the same for both languages

Depends on how closely related they are to the language you already have an understanding of.
