>I think that saying that you can never say ""but"" or ""however"" is going against the spirit of DBT which is avoiding extremes in thought and behavior.

In other words, they seem to be non-toxic. I'd like to keep my other products non-toxic (and affordable!) as well. My skin is pretty good on its own but it could use a little extra help.

1. I'd like to take care of blackheads on my nose so if someone could please recommend a salicylic acid product that doesn't contain any artificial colors, fragrances, other toxic ingredients I would appreciate it.
2. A zinc based sunscreen without any artificial colors, fragrances, other toxic ingredients.
3. A mask (not clay, since apparently it dries out your skin.
4. Not sure if I need a cleanser for the rest of my face since it's pretty good already, but will probably try the one from Vanicream if cleanser is recommended for folks with clear skin to start with. I get acne sometimes but it's not unbearable. 

Thanks!"

Something else I was looking into prior to starting this job is system administrator, but if it's anything like I'm doing now then count me out lol.

I think for us INFJ folks we need to be whole first before finding love, and learn to accept everything about who we are. There's no fuck ups, no perfect timing, just yourself and what you want. I should be clear there's no fuck ups if you're being respectful. I only say all this because I'm in therapy now and this is what we work on. The feelings of uncertainty in what to do or how the other person felt about me drove me to great distress. INFJ are passionate and perfectionistic, unfortunately when we get interested in someone, we want everything we do to be perfect around that person even if that means sacrificing our own health or maybe coming on strong. A lot of people aren't comfortable with that. Comes with being the rarest personality type."
