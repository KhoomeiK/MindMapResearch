namenerds,ffka92j,t1_ffk8vlx,1580019499.0,That would be perfect if my uncle didn’t already have a dog named Yoda! I also have 2 rabbits that have human sounding names. Their names are Harvey and Midge and I talk about them like they’re people. Most of the time people assume they are my grandparents until I complain that Harvey keeps eating my plants and Midge keeps eating my books.
namenerds,ffk8noo,t1_ffk5tv2,1580018769.0,That’s funny! Hubby and I are Star Wars fans and I keep bringing up D-O as a name. Hubby says no every time...
dogs,fddr7g3,t1_fddp8nf,1578321845.0,We would love to continue to foster! We’ve only just started but it’s been a great experience so far!
dogs,fddqwgn,t1_fdcgo29,1578321604.0,"That’s a great way to think about it! We love him so much already and his personality is coming out more and more the longer we work with him. He’s such a goof ball! And I think because of how easy going he is, we could definitely keep fostering with him. The rescue has told us they are really in need of fosters and they’ve actually turned dogs away because they couldn’t find them a foster home. So, you are right. There certainly isn’t a shortage of dogs in need! Sounds like I shouldn’t feel so guilty."
dogs,fdd1h36,t1_fdcr0ax,1578291041.0,"These are all very good points and I have thought about them for quite a long time. Our main concern is finding a dog that fits our lifestyle and can easily get along with other pets which he does perfectly so far. I’ve grown up with dogs my whole life but my husband is a bit more inexperienced with dogs so I mostly wanted to make sure he was 100% comfortable with the decision. We started off pet/dog sitting and that has gone very well so we thought we’d try out fostering for a while and see how well we’d do with that. We knew they’d allow us to adopt our fosters but I was hoping we’d foster a few before we adopted. I suppose that was a bit naïve. So I guess we decided to foster because we do want to adopt but we wanted to be 110% sure we were ready, well informed, and adopting the right dog. Also, we love dogs and have a great time volunteering. We are both in a good place with our jobs and finances right now and are ready for the ~16 year commitment. To me, 16 years is just not long enough. I just sort of feel guilty I guess because maybe I’m being selfish and not giving other families a chance to love him and adopt him."
Rabbits,fcznywn,t1_fczjwd6,1578105397.0,Oh! That’s very fascinating. Thank you so much for the info!
dogs,fcznl7s,t1_fczk9vb,1578105143.0,"All they’ve said right now is that the dog is being treated starting today for worms and fleas with medications and flea preventive from the vet. They didn’t give us specifics but we should be getting the vets papers tomorrow along with the dog.

Right now it is at another foster home temporarily until we can pick it up tomorrow. They did mention that they will be bathing it tonight but they haven’t mentioned bathing it tomorrow before pickup. I can make sure to request another bath before we pick him up."
dogs,fczmv92,t1_fczk0yn,1578104694.0,We do have a bathroom that has a space large enough for the kennel. I was thinking about possibly keeping it in there but it doesn’t really allow much space for play.
