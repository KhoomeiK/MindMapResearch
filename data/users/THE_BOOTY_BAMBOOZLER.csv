CAguns,ffgsyrj,t1_ffgqjg5,1579914267.0,He mentioned an AR in his post.
CAguns,ffgsue8,t3_etjbqg,1579914178.0,"In California, you’ll know if it’s an AR pistol or rifle. Because the pistol will be explicitly stated as such and will likely be a Franklin Armory CA7, since that model is on the pistol roster. Building an AR rifle in California, you have the option of featureless or fixed-magazine.

Featureless: No collapsing stock, no pistol grip, no flash hider, no vertical foregrip. On the plus side, you get a standard magazine release and can use any standard capacity (or more than 10 rounds) magazines you may have acquired during “Freedom Week” last year. Downside is your rifle looks like ass and loses some ergonomics.

Fixed magazine: can have a collapsing stock, pistol grip, flash hider, and vertical foregrip. On the plus side, your rifle will look like it would in any other state, and depending on the fixed-mag product you use will only take a minute to become a normal mag release (if, for example, you take the rifle out of state to shoot). Downside is your reloads will take more effort; you’ll also be doing more of them, since you can only use 10 round magazines or less with a fixed magazine rifle.

You can alternate between the two at any time, you don’t have to pick one and stick with it.

My recommendation, decide what you think will suit your purposes. Then buy a stripped lower (doesn’t really matter which) parts to finish it (lower parts kit, buffer assembly, stock, and grip and trigger if necessary), and a complete upper (a bit harder to put together if you lack tools than a lower)."

If 200,000 clones put up that much of a fight for the Separatists, another 5 million clones would have stomped them."
