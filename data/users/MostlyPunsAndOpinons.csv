But they can't be true friends, because they're too competitive, and too different in their morals. It's such a dance that never quite pins the relationship down. It's a connection that is stronger than friendship—it's a grudging respect and joy in the game of each other's company."

The dragon in this poster looks like a dragon from a specific *other kind* of movie—a dark mythic fantasy. Terrifying, malicious dragons don't really help build wonder and innocent joy.
