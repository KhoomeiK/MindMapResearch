todayilearned,fc4qmqe,t1_fc37qak,1577424884.0,"You're using ""punitive damages"" and I don't think that's what you mean. There are compensatory damages, which are the basic ""out of pocket"" damages like medical care, past & future, lost wages, etc. (sometimes called economic damages) There are also ""pain & suffering"" damages--what you get to deal with the hassle of having your life blown up (non-economic damages). It is to compensate you for, well, pain & suffering. ""Punitive Damages"" are very rarely awarded in civil cases, and usually only at the far far side of egregious behavior. The vast majority of med/mal cases don't have a punitive damages award because while the defendant should make you whole, we don't tend to punish in civil awards. Sometimes, like in the recent Roundup cases, the jury will throw in a humongous punitive damages award against a huge company because an award in the hundreds of millions is the only thing that is going to make Monsanto/Bayer pay attention. In the Roundup cases, that punitive damages number will be greatly reduced on appeal or eliminated particularly given the fact that there's no actual evidence glyphosate is a carcinogen.

Economic: out of pocket
Non-economic: pain & suffering
Punitive: punishment

BTW in CA they capped non-economic damages at $250k DECADES ago, and have not revised it since. This is because doctors and insurance companies have fantastic lobbyists. It is downright criminal that your doctor could, for example, cut off the wrong leg, and you're capped at $250k for the pain & suffering."
