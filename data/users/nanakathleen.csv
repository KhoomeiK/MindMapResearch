esist,ffg7cux,t1_fffwh75,1579900034.0,I am so happy to see people seeing this the same way I do. It seems so obvious to me.

CatsAreAssholes,fexn9tq,t3_eqpaz6,1579433611.0,"Our cats obsession used to be eraser tops until we hosted my son's cat Ben over the Holidays, now she is playing with and hiding pipe cleaners (Ben's obsession) all over my house."
GriefSupport,fejpyu4,t3_epi31v,1579182862.0,"My older brother Bobby died when he was 18.  My mother had 6 children and after he died she would reply 6 to random questions from strangers but if it was someone she knew would see again, like a new person at church, she would say ""I have 5 surviving, knowing that it would lead to her having to tell his story.  It hurt her every time to talk about it, so, in short, she didn't unless she felt like it was unavoidable.  I just lost my daughter and am going to do this as well."
cats,fejly9t,t3_epc4v5,1579179368.0,You are so obviously joyously happy!  Awesome
addiction,fejkhcu,t3_epbb8m,1579177916.0,"Very well written and so completely true.  I know that many people here are saying ""I could've written that"".  The part that hit me hardest is that I finally got ""that"" call on Nov 22nd."
GriefSupport,fegg1kw,t1_fe8cgra,1579091542.0,"Thank you for the kind words, this is why we are here, to support one another.  My daughter was 42, I cannot envision losing a baby"

addiction,fdnca4h,t3_em6afi,1578582698.0,Well said.

GriefSupport,fdekm9y,t1_fde3u8u,1578341026.0,"I like your reply that makes a lot of sense to me. And that's exactly how I felt, comforted not scared."
GriefSupport,fddivgb,t3_ekn5f4,1578314062.0,"After my brother died I had a very vivid dream, this was only a day or two later. He was sitting on the bottom of my bed and he was telling me, ""that he was fine and not to be too sad"".  This part to me had always been the most creepy, his body was already deteriorating. I honestly don't believe in ghosts or ""signs"" from the dead, even though this is the most realistic dream I ever had, it's just your subconscious brain trying to help. This is the only time anything like this has ever happened to me and I have way too much personal experience with the death of loved ones."
Anxiety,fd9kbyy,t3_ekd67q,1578234616.0,"I have this problem also. My dad died when I was 11, my oldest brother at 17, last year I lost 2 of my Aunts and 2 of my Uncles and my mother. And then on Nov 22nd my daughter died. I am 66. And I am fried. I developed a fear of death for obvious reasons. After many years I thought I had it under control, basically every time someone I loved walked out the door, I would start worrying. BUT...  WTF...  I am now back to square one, maybe minus one. I am a Progressive Christian and I believe in life after death, and of course this helps me tremendously. I cannot even imagine how much scarier this fear is for you. I have a suggestion and I hope it helps. My daughter had an eclectic group of spiritual beliefs and I planned a secular service for her largely online. I found many resources, remember that you are not alone, this a fear that affects all of us, religious or not. I hope this helps, I am sending you love."

GriefSupport,fcu2xs5,t3_eisaua,1577970929.0,"Same here, lost my daughter Nov 22nd.  Worst Holidays ever.  Barely got through it but had to, we raised both of her kids, the youngest is just 14.  I don't think I will ever truly enjoy the Holidays again."
cats,fcu02qz,t3_eiqsvo,1577967786.0,"Ha!  We have an adopted feral, she can be viscous but has mellowed some with age, she is 6.  Over the Holidays our oldest came home with his cat and his friends (catsitting).  We were worried sick that she would hurt them, but...  Aside from some hissing and confrontational behavior, they were fine.  Now I want another cat, how to convince my husband, hmm"
RhodeIsland,fcnrskc,t3_ei5gwm,1577817204.0,"That's so cool, thanks, we're on it."
GriefSupport,fckkwj7,t3_ehbbv9,1577727561.0,"I just lost my daughter.  And no one was truly surprised.  But everyone was shocked. The first thing everyone seemed to do was to check social media because she suffered from suicidal thoughts and had made past attempts. When I called my best friend, I told her that I had gotten the call I always knew was coming. It still and still does feel unreal"
