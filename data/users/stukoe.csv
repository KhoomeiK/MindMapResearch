college,ffec6rg,t1_ffebvgh,1579842790.0,"Honestly if you're a broke college student it would be better to indulge in a hulu subscription and some chips rather than giving the few dollars to a homeless person.

Us college folk have it tough, and we deserve that reward of kicking back to watch Brooklyn Nine Nine while snacking on cool ranch doritos. 

Besides, someone else will likely toss a dollar that homeless person's way."

college,feufzx1,t3_eqdwbp,1579386147.0,"Honestly, faking it is just actually making it.

If you're able minded enough to appear like you're in control, then what separates you from someone that isn't faking it? How can you be certain someone else isn't just faking it?

On the topic of being too anxious to perform actions, I can relate. Simply practice doing them. I worked with kids which ultimately forced me into a corner labeled ""leadership role"". After time I naturally handled tricky situations without giving a second thought. 

If you have trouble finding solutions, just do the first thing that comes to mind. If you're like me and have a voice of doubt for just about anything your imagination musters, just do it before your brain even has the time to second guess itself. It is a habit that I pushed upon myself that really improved my ability to remain confident in what I say or do.

Lastly, this one is optional, weed. Here me out first. Lasting effects of marijuana (meaning while you aren't high) have helped prevent my brain from second guessing everything. I also almost never feel nervous or anxious when in charge or simply just tasked with doing something. Again, this is optional, because marijuana is different for everyone. I'm just giving input from my experience.

Hope this helps!"
