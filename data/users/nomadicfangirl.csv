I also used *gulp* Pert Plus. (Seriously. Not a damn clue what to do.) and gels with lots of alcohols because that was all that was available in small town Kansas from the local Alco store. 

I’m so happy to live in civilization now with more options available."
curlyhair,ffe0fok,t1_ffduumx,1579833488.0,Same. My short hairs towards the front don’t have a good curl pattern - they’re just frizzy. So I flatten them so they’ll hide the bumps on my forehead and frame my face.
curlyhair,ffe09nd,t1_ffdrp5e,1579833368.0,I wish I was 10 years older because I would have had ROCKIN 80s-early 90s hair. But nooooooo the super stick straight Avril Lavigne hair was in when I was in high school. And then there’s me with the mushroom cloud (even worse because I did not know what I was doing and my curls had no definition).
