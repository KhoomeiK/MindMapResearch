Aquariums,fgjz9fk,t3_eyy16b,1580854312.0,"There's a powder that I bought to treat the fish AND the tank.  For Camallanous worms, you kind of have to treat the fish and the tank together.  There's no other way that I know of.

It's as easy as: do a BIG water change, measure correctly, dump it in, wait a few days, as instructed, and do another big WC again.  Leave everything (heater, filter, etc) in the tank.

When I get home, I can take a pic of it for you.  It worked pretty well, but it's powerful and I actually went out and bought a gram scale accurate to 2 decimal places(like $25) to make sure I didn't mess it up.

Negative numbers aren't tangible (you can't hold -6 crayons in your hand), but you understand their uses and you don't have to ""imagine what they're equal to"". You just accept that -6 = -6.

Same thing with complex numbers. 3+5i = 3+5i.  Lots of people use them and they're accepted just as easily as you accept Real numbers. In fact, every single Theorem of Calculus still holds when you apply them to complex variables.

Edit: Additionally, the set of all complex numbers INCLUDES all of the Reals as well.  So, -6 = -6+0i."

I think it's because a lot of people I've personally met that call themselves Liberal or Democrat tend to be extremely left or liberal or whatever you call it.  Whereas, I'm mostly right in the middle and leaning more left in recent years.

In my area, I've had lots of liberals try to push their views on me by talking loudly and quickly.  Much more than the non-crazy Republicans (excluding the ridiculous church people that chase you down to tell you you're going to burn).  Also a lot of liberal/democratic people figuratively shitting on white males.  I think I tend to pick the side with less hate and they happen to be Republican(ironically), in my area, even though I personally disagree with most of their current views.

Again, this is just in my area though; I do my best to vote for what I think is best for the majority of people, not just for me in my city."
politics,fgga430,t1_fgg96wd,1580757515.0,"Oh yes! I agree with you!  Sorry if my wording is convoluted, but I totally agree that WAY more people gain and benefit!

I don't like it when people just use the blanket-term 'Republican' to place blame, but definitely admit that most of the party is fucked right now.  I consider myself Republican still, even though I've voted Democrat for the last 10 years, lol.

I also agree that using it as a talking point is absurd.  Bottom line is: It doesn't matter who's right.  If they don't exist, then believers are idiots.  If they do exist, then it's a negligible % of society and most of us benefit and don't abuse the system...so believers are still idiots.

Not sure about war-profiteering.  The US economy is largely based on wars and, from an arbitrary standpoint, I think wars can sometimes be extremely helpful to the economy.  But there's got to be a better way.

And yes, that was the point I was trying to make, though I may not have said it clear enough.  Exploitation is forever, but it's a very small, if not negligible, part of the system.  We can't focus on that small portion and ignore the fact that most people benefit."

politics,fgg3obn,t1_fgft33s,1580753560.0,"TL;DR: I disagree with you.  It's not racism.  And Welfare Queens do exist.  But, they're a ridiculously small portion of society and way more people are helped by these policies, so they should stay in place.

Edit: Typical Reddit.  I agree with your end result, but disagree about the reasoning and still get downvoted.  In all likeliness, we're both probably correct.

Original Post: I disagree.  I'm white and grew up in a poor area.  My idea of a Welfare Queen/King is definitely the white druggie that has 10 kids and trades their EBT card $$$ for $.50 on the dollar cash.  I've sold cars to the non-druggies, too, that make more than I did because they have 10kids or have another way to manipulate the system.

I believe it's NOT founded on racism at all.  The belief is founded on ""that ONE person they saw that ONE time."" And it sticks in peoples' heads.

The issue is...these policies help WAY more than they hurt.  No matter what happens, there will always be at least one person finding loopholes... but it's one person.  So, these policies should definitely stay in place."
politics,fgg26ov,t1_fgfshgk,1580752634.0,"TL;DR: Met several actual Welfare Queens/Kings while working in sales and, despite that, I believe these systems do more good than harm. It doesn't matter if they exist or don't: bottom line is that these policies help the majority of people.

I used to sell cars ~10yrs ago and actually met a real-life Welfare Queen.  She had shit credit and was trying to finance a new Toyota.  I asked her, ""Ma'am, how do you expect to pay for this vehicle?"" She responded with ""Honey, I have 11 kids.  The government pays me ~5k/month."" She got the car.

*Disclaimer: numbers are probably wrong; was 10yrs ago.  The point is that she managed to get a new vehicle, using gov't money and treating her kids like commodities.*

That being said, she was a minority in the system.  She was one of the few that came in and abused the system.  Most of the people I met didn't.

I don't know the numbers and used to support cutting Welfare and Medicare/Medicaid.  But, my views have changed.  Regardless of the actual numbers, I prefer to think that there are more people benefiting from these lifelines than taking advantage of them."

Additionally, I've got the Stingray 2 for my 20gal long.  It's nice, but the mounts that come with it sit too low and I have trouble getting nice lighting evenly distributed across the tank.  If I had taller mounts, I bet it'd look a lot better.

For my particular setup, it's almost too much light, though.  My tank is a Walstad setup and I've been battling staghorn algae on and off for a few months, lol.

Watch out for the under-belly fire blast.  He'll rear up on both back legs, look underneath himself, and breath fire under himself. When you see him rear up, run to the outside of his back legs and get 3-4 good hits on em.

Toyota literally just bolted extra seats, a rollbar, and a topper on the truck and called it a 4runner. Same engines, same trans, same suspension, same interior plastic pieces, same everythibg. I have a 1st gen 4Runner and LOVE it!

As for choice: either choose based on the engine/trans or choose the one with more seats.  The 22re is bulletproof.  I have the 3VZ engine I my 4runner and it has a cooked headgasket near cyl 6(A known issue on the 3VZ, and there's a mod to correct it).  But, the 3V is more powerful than the 22re.  Taking off the topper can be a pain in the ass, but it's absolutely worth it for beach days with friends and the dog. They're both equally amazing, so choose what you like better.

How old?  Like T-100 old?  The Toyota pickup and 4Runner were exactly the same between 1985-1989 and only slightly different afterwards.  And I LOVE my 1st Gen 4Runner, lol.

I sold Toyotas in 2011 and the Tundra was AWESOME.  I don't know much about the longevity of the 4Runners in that year, though. But customers loved them=/

happy,ff33jjg,t3_erct6u,1579532765.0,Have you? Your 3rd post is someone else's drawing that you decided to take credit for so...
nonononoyes,fez02o0,t1_feyymss,1579452602.0,"Very true!  Heads up, I'm not a pilot, but other redditors who are have said that, in practice, you don't actually land.  Instead, you power the engine back on and just hover.  However, it should all be very controlled. Unlike this video, a good autorotation landing is very controlled and cushioned(no crazy sliding and bouncing).  This person just completely flubbed it=\

Successfully demonstrating an autorotation is a requirement to get your license and is practiced regularly, so that it can be done thoughtlessly in an emergency.

Edit: until 2016, it was required to get your license, as per the comment above me."

Aquariums,fev9o4u,t1_fev5kzt,1579394811.0,"Well, I added the betta first, along with 2 nerites.  Then, I added 3 otocinclus and 3-4 ghost shrimp and the betta ignored them completely, lol.  Then, I added 3 dwarf corydoras and he also ignored them.  Finally, I added the 5 ember tetras.  And that's that, lol.

Every betta is different, so you'll have to watch and see what happens, lol"

Aquariums,fev4s4c,t3_eqoqmi,1579393075.0,"What the other guy/gal said: you could likely add a small school of nano fish(5-6).  CPDs are a good choice; I, personally, have 5 ember tetras with my betta, in a 10gal.

When I first added them, my betta was pretty territorial and chased them a LOT but, after 3-4 days, he adjusted and didn't bother them anymore.  Now, he's content and building bubble nests=)"
Aquariums,fev3x3x,t1_fev3p56,1579392842.0,"No problem! You can also just let it float on the surface; it gets nutrients directly from the water column and won't grow roots.

Also check my comment edit!"
Aquariums,fev3jnt,t3_eqoqml,1579392679.0,"Add Hornwort! It's alleopathic with Cyanobacteria and helps kill + prevent it.

Remove the majority of it first via trimming/scrubbing the gravel + decorations/etc, then either plant the Hornwort like a stem plant, attach it to decorations, or let it float at the top.

As for chems/meds, I'm unsure and hopefully someone else will come along.

Edit: Duh, I forgot!  Black out the tank for a few(~3) days! Completely dark, so cover it with a thick blanket or towel.  Only remove to feed your fish.  That'll likely kill it all and your plants will be fine."

DarkSouls2,fem5k7w,t3_epvub5,1579240527.0,"I'd read up on powerstancing in DS2.  It's the only one that has it, so you may as well enjoy it.

Pressing and holding Y(or triangle) will let you 2H your left hand weapon. If you have enough str/dex, you can dual-wield with the left weapon moveset.

I've got 42 str and, with Bandit Greataxe in my left hand and Greatsword in my right, I can powerstance them and can essentially use L1 + L2 to swing the Greatsword a LOT faster, with the Bandit Greataxe moveset.

Another common thing ppl do is powerstancing Clubs. You can literally stunlock(stagger) some bosses, lol"

KidsAreFuckingStupid,feds03o,t1_fedglsq,1579018638.0,I'd suggest doing a lot more research in fishkeeping.  You never want to clean more than 25% of the tank at one time and it should never ever ever be as dirty as you describe.  Sounds like you have an improper setup and loads of balance issues to work out.
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fedrlvo,t1_fedogt4,1579018393.0,"If people are getting infections from their fish tanks, then they're doing something very wrong.  When properly kept, they're not grimy or disgusting.  Yes, everything in them will be slimey due to the beneficial bacteria, but not dangerous.  A bucket of rainwater left outside contains more harmful things than an aquarium."
