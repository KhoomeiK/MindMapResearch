Only questioning this part of your answer.  Isn't civil court slightly biased towards the accuser?  The standard of proof is the preponderance of the evidence, i.e., > 50%, unlike the ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" criminal standard.  That means a claim would be automatically accepted as true if not refuted, since the claim is more evidence than nothing.

Which is not to say it wouldn't still be easy for Hillary.  As long as she hasn't made statements to the contrary, a simple ""I believe it to be true"" is evidence that Tulsi cannot counter as she is not privy to Hillary's private thoughts."
