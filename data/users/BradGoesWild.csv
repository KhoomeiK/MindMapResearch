Once I'm out of debt going for chemical/environmental engineering, you can bet your ass my philanthropy will go towards environmental initiatives.

leagueoflegends,ffk7y3o,t3_eu086q,1580018444.0,"Ok I have to say something about this.

Disclaimer: any environmental initiative is a good thing from any company. To a degree.

But, let's put that promise from Flyquest into perspective. So, it was said on broadcast the max is 1800 trees based on their potential victories (100 per IIRC). I learned during my volunteer period in the Daks that an experienced reforester can plant at least 2 saplings a minute. The best can do 3. They're literally talking about supplying 15 hours of work MAX TOTAL to a reforestation initiative. This is an embarrassing publicity stunt from a major corporation, when a streamer like Mr. Beast can raise 20mil$ for the same objective. This is false philanthropy at its worst. A corporation like Flyquest could afford 100x that donation without breaking a sweat. Probably 1000x. This kind of false philanthropy is more damaging than you realize - it can lead to people withholding private donations in favor of supporting organizations that exaggerate their philanthropic impact. This should be less than the minimum expected from multi-million corporations. I understand the argument that they don't have to be doing anything at all, but, well, nobody technically has to. And that mentality will lead to a completely dead world in 50 years. Nobody is forcing those reforesters, many of which are volunteers, to go out and do something meaningful. I expect better from everyone. Everyone has to do their part. And those with the resources of these orgs have the absolute responsibility to do far more than they are, especially if they are going to start their own environmental initiatives that fall far short. I see statistics that 15 BIL trees are cut down per year as an estimate. It's legitimately sad that an org would hang 1800 as a legitimate accomplishment.

https://www.eiu.com/topic/democracy-index
Here it is, the 2nd option on Google below the Wikipedia article... too difficult for you to find? 

I'm arguing my original point, which clearly you've forgotten about with your memory of a goldfish, when I said Norway wasn't important globally, which *you* responded to with all your reasons why it was. Reasons that I gave arguments against. That is what I'm arguing, very, very, very obviously if you're following along here. I said exactly why I thought your example of the investment fund was stupid and irrelevant in terms of global importance (ie, if you can still remember, the original argument - still following along?). 

Also, your point about kneeling for China is fucking hilarious. The USA and the 'trade war' as it's been labeled, is the foremost and possibly only real opposition to Chinese economic expansion and potential domination. I think you were trying to imply the USA is kneeling for China, which, maybe Hollywood and the rest of the media is on social issues, but that has absolutely nothing to the actual politics of the situation. 

I wonder where the fuck you are from, that you know so very little about both Norway and the United States, and yet like to make contrived arguments about them anyways. I was at least hoping you were a Norwegian national defending their pride in their nation; this is just sad lmfao. I really love the ""rightfully so"" part of your comment btw, really playing into my point of the hypocrisy and arrogance of non-Americans when talking about America."

I presume you meant almost a century ago, not decade, doesn't matter bc either way that statement is complete bullshit. Did you think the 90 yr old former Nazis that managed to escape deserved mercy when they were tracked down? Imagine if the USA was like lol slavery was so long ago we're gonna ignore that shit. Hey, you can always discuss what you have in common with Japan and what never happened in Nanjing! 

Being 91% of the size of a *state* of another country, a nation itself only approx 50% the size of Russia, makes it a small nation. That's not even factoring in population density, which you acknowledged being extremely low. Literally no argument can be made that Norway is a large country.

Being highly ranked by the democracy index is a direct result of everything I previously said about the demographics/sociology, so idk why you think waving the designation around is going to change the argument. Following that, you seem to think that having a large investment fund is more important than having a large economy for some reason? Hopefully, you can understand why generating GDP is far more beneficial for the world economy than hoarding savings for personal profit generation. On the world scale, you're a Wall Street hedge fund compared to the farms, markets, factories etc. that actually drive the world. Also, how the hell are you bragging about the fact that massive natural oil resources were discovered and evidently didn't go towards improving quality of life for it's citizens by increasing social programs at decreased cost to taxpayers? Actually delusional, it'd seriously be like if I was bragging that I didn't have to pay the same taxes as you for centralized health care, ignoring the fact they'd let me die in a hospital if I didn't have insurance.

All of these reasons, and the one's in my previous comment, are why I stand by my claim that Norway is unimportant globally. I also threw in some reasons why I think that maybe these Nordic nations that love to look down on the USA and other countries on social issues are fucking hypocrites. It's smug shit like linking the Wikipedia article for the democracy index, not even the actual fucking democracy index, that I'm talking about, bc you think that *actually fucking constitutes an argument.*"

Their pushing of Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia was 100% motivated by their desire to expand their territory, but needing a justification for war, they anticipated the chain of alliances appearing to force their hand- when in reality they started the dominos falling themselves. I really don’t understand why you’re determined to be apologist for any of the Reichs dude. It’s pretty obvious you don’t have to be fascist to be evil. Additionally, fascism was an inevitable product of the philosophy at the time regardless of the war outcome, and I find it incredibly likely that it would have taken root in Germany regardless of the outcome of wwi. So, Germany wins wwi, controls at least France and probably GB as well, becomes fascist and launches their invasion of Russia without the pesky western front holding them back. Before the USA can even consider mobilization, Russia falls to blitzkrieg. All the same problems with Russia that caused the Nazis to be almost successful in taking Moscow in real life are magnified massively by the decreased time to mobilize and otherwise prepare defensively and the focused German troops on the eastern front smash Stalin. Eventually, a conflict between America and German is inevitable, but now we have few remaining allies and are against a German empire spanning Europe and Russia, if not all of continental Asia. Plus, without the competition between european powers for imperialism, all colonies and territories formerly controlled by GB, France, etc fall to German control. Those who attempt rebellion against the new rule are inevitably and mercilessly crushed. It’s probably conflict over these territories that starts the war between this hypothetical German empire and America.

So in conclusion, the world was guaranteed to be some level of fucked up after the world wars. I’m personally glad it’s only this fucked up. We could be heiling Hitler’s son for one thing (or the equivalent). Bismarck’s vision for the a united Germany of all the Germanic states was both impressive and more importantly, positively motivated. Bismarck famously told the Kaiser when Bismarck was near his deathbed that if Germany maintained its current course, in 20 years there would be war across Europe, started by some damn fool thing in the Balkans. He was right almost to the *month* - it was 20 yrs and one month after that fateful final meeting that the Archduke was assassinated. Bismarck was the greatest diplomat of all time because he was one of the first to see the potential of military deterrents rather than direct action. He wanted a strong Germany as a strong defensive nation, centered on the continent with the potential to be the bastion of peace in the region. Unfortunately, the complete opposite happened in his absence. You want to find a source of German pride? Study Bismarck."

So no, I do not think Norway is important for anything other than being a small, self-serving, state of the EU. California has an approx 10x bigger economy than Norway by GDP btw, so that investment fund claim is just stupid and irrelevant.

Additionally, I found estimates of Norway’s immigrant population to be around 12% (including descendants of migrants too). That is ludicrously small. Newsflash: a country which has a small, nearly homogeneous population and strong economy (sweet sweet Nazi money, then oil money, saved and invested), doesn’t leave much room for political discord. Everyone fucking agrees with each other, there are no budget shortages to force social cuts, so everyone gets what they want almost always. If you can’t see that you don’t understand sociology in the slightest."

B) Sure, the current military industrial complex sucks, but it was absolutely fucking necessary, especially in wwii, otherwise Britain would certainly have fallen. That’s what I mean by revisionist - you’re looking at something that’s currently shitty and allowing it to cloud your judgment of past events. The United States doesn’t commit to total war production, the world becomes Nazi. I’ve studied a lot of wwii, and I’m extremely confident of that fact. The war was almost lost as it is."

civ5,fdkufrx,t1_fdjwkb0,1578511381.0,"You’re definitely right about not being able to execute the strat if you’re gonna die to an invasion, but the issue I have is that preemptive unit construction has a long term drain on economy in addition to slowing production of win condition buildings. I agree that my analysis is certainly pigeonholed by my own play style as well, and admittedly losing to a sneak attack is just ab the only way I do. But, I also find that if you are ahead enough with your sci/eco development, its really not too hard to generate a strong defensive force in only a handful of turns. Additionally, the AI will only fight a war of attrition with you for so long; if you just withstand their onslaught for 10-15 turns I almost always am able to sue for peace (and often they will accept it with even terms). 

It all comes down to diplo imo- if you know what ais do what, you can always be prepared. If Shakas cap is next to urs, build defense. If it’s Dando, ur completely fine."
civ5,fdirw5o,t1_fdikeix,1578449662.0,"Losing to early game military is 100% determined by capital proximity. I primarily play large islands and small continents +, which generally ends up with it very low. Building military units for defense only slows down your overall progress towards your strategy if you do it properly. If you are playing offensively that's a completely different strat."
civ5,fdhl6g4,t3_elf29q,1578424988.0,"Early game is all about 3 things: the religion race, food/happiness generation (aka population growth), and territory establishment (aka settling). The first production should (IMO) always be a monument with pottery research. Following this it is dependent on what resources are available to the capital. I am a huge believer in the power of  coastal cities and sea resources; if you have 3+ sea resources within reach (aka within 3 hexs of a city) I always would follow up pottery with sailing. Follow monument with shrine, then start pumping out fishing boats. Once you found a pantheon, god of the sea is my absolute favorite tenet (+1 prod to fishing boats) since it adds further buff to an already strong resource (lighthouse already gives +1prod +1food to sea resources). Remember that *tile improvements do not contribute anything unless worked by a citizen.* This is easily overlooked, and makes it easy to waste resources improving tiles that aren't optimal to work. Choose techs such as mining/masonry/trapping as required to improve strategic or luxury resources, however researching these techs are a waste of turns in the very early game unless you immediately need them. Your first high science req tech should be philosophy -why? Allows building temple, which is critical to beating the AI to founding a religion on higher levels. This requires calendar and writing, conveniently both great techs for plantation and library respectively. Build library once you have produced your early game requirements (mon, shrine, boats etc) which should allow you to research philo without spending an eternity on it.

Reactive play is good while behind or even, but without an overall strategy you cannot extend a lead properly bc you yourself need to dictate how the game plays out which cannot be done reactively. In terms of researching techs by era, in general this is smart bc of the difference in turns required to research techs, however since science is in essence going towards a sum goal (all the techs in the game require X amount of science total) and since it is cumulative, the order by which you spend science does not actually affect the net progress.

Edit: some accurate corrections, but I still believe that coastal cities with sea resources are the strongest early game option."
civ5,fd5qqfe,t1_fd5fud0,1578180419.0,"Religious points go towards the civ owning the city/territory, but will generate value for the religious tenets according to each respective city’s majority religion (eg gold per total followers goes to the founder, +1 culture from plantation goes to the city owner). You can spend the religion points your civ generates in any city and on anything that the city’s religion (or your own social policies) allows. So if you have Buddhism and Christianity, and say Christianity has Jesuit education, you can only purchase the science buildings allowed by that tenet in cities following Christianity as majority religion."
