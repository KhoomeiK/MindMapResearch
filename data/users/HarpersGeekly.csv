I never played online and I only ever made it to Chapter 4. I would just explore and look for collectibles, hunt and fish, get into whatever antics I felt like. I don’t think I’ll ever “finish” that game formally. Maybe. Same exact thing happened with GTA5. I just stopped one day during the campaign and never went back. Open world games really do be like that sometimes...

Oh yeah. I remember now. I was going for the 100% completion achievement in RDR2 and I was doing so well until I found out I’ll only ever reach 99% completion because that last 1% is a fucking glitch. When I researched and concluded I couldn’t get it unless I restarted my entire game, I lost all motivation to continue. Oh and the missions don’t save your progress for gold rank too so you have to accomplish each and every task if you replay the mission. Stuff like that really irritates me and tells me it’s just a bullshit video game, really. Gorgeous to look at, fun to mess around in, but bullshit."

Haha I love that. Palpatine’s ghost whizzing around looking for someone. 

Ricky Gervais: “Why do spirits whiz around when they die?” 

Karl Pilkington: “Because they’re going ‘where am I goin?’”

Ricky: “are they?”

Karl: “and they’re whizzin ‘round aren’t they? Am I goin down am I goin up?”

JamesBond,fetbgay,t3_eqg6sj,1579373626.0,"No, I do not think Pierce Brosnan is “underrated”. He’s completely serviceable and was one of the most popular Bonds ever.

The only thing maybe considered underrated about Brosnan is the movie that is getting more and more appreciation today, Tomorrow Never Dies. It’s his best role. He really comes into his own in that one. 

But it’s the movie itself that holds up incredibly well, I think better than any other Brosnan entry. It’s so watchable today. Beat for beat it barrels through its paces with energy, and it’s just plain fun. Roger Spottiswoode crafted a great action movie that is surprisingly timeless along with being eerily relevant today."
