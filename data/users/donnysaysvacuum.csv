Also, your premise is false. All the features of a note 10+ can fit on a 4"" screened phone(perhaps with a shorter spen), they just have to make it thicker. Just because manufacturers cripple their smaller  devices doesn't mean they have to be
The reason you see so many people on this sub wanting a small phone is that they don't make any anymore. (iPhone SE is ancient and not for everyone). People who like huge phones aren't complaining because they have lots of choices."
moderatepolitics,ff8sxug,t1_ff7rvcg,1579694885.0,"From what I've read trees themselves only store carbon temporarily. When they die, burn or rot they released 100% back into the atmosphere. Planting trees in the right place is probably good for other reasons, but offsetting fossil fuel usage is not one of them. The only way to get rid of that carbon is to reliquify and pump it back into the ground sadly.

And in the time that these cheaper phones have stuck with USB c, these people have probably replaced their micro usb cables already. When I had phones with micro usb they got damaged regularly. Since getting a USB c cable, I haven't replaced a single one.

I think they should focus on unique features and segments. Trying to hit every $50 increment of price with almost identical phones just confuses people. They should make a modern 3310 smartphone, swappable bodies, durable build. Or a modern pureview, with a huge camera. A high end small phone, etc."
