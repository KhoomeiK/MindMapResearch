personalfinance,ff85cy6,t3_es63cc,1579666435.0,"I’ve tried to tell people that he’s not the “be all end all” of financial advice, but he has a real cult following (not saying that Christianity is a cult, but more than a few people I know were turned on to him through pre-marriage counseling).  

I was trying to explain to a coworker that paying off his 2% interest rate loan early was short sighted when he and his wife both have well paying and secure jobs. But Dave doesn’t agree. I’ll admit his advice is good for people who are deeply in debt, but a good portion of his testimonials are people who would have been successful anyway once they started limiting spending."
