Probably not irl (haven’t seen any gore in real life) but the only thing I couldn’t take on that sub was a man eating his own shit. Everything else for some reason I can take and just move on without much thought

Edit: this makes me sound like a much more fucked up person than I am. Trust me I’m not that bad I just find online stuff easier to digest I think"
unpopularopinion,ff3a7n6,t1_ff1m5p2,1579537255.0,I’ve listened to MTBMB like 3 times all through out and the worst 2 for me are those kinda nights and yah yah. (Even though i will still happily listen to them)
unpopularopinion,ff3a0vg,t1_ff1mg0f,1579537160.0,"I mean fair enough. Everyone has opinions and I do agree that listening through the whole album can be a bit shit. But there are quite a few that stuck with me. I liked more than I hated on there. I think that also most people who have grown up listening to em know how good he can be in his prime but I never got that (I wasn’t even alive for sslp, mmlp or tes) so I wasn’t there with the hype. But I do completely understand why not many people like it I just liked it myself"
Eminem,ff1lqdj,t3_er3e9k,1579481246.0,This song was amazing for me. I heard the song late because i saw the album dropped basically as I got to school so I couldn’t listen to it. But I saw a comment that went in depth about it so I kinda cheated and knew from ten start what it was about. But it is amazing from a story telling point of view. I’m gonna nominate leaving heaven ft. Skylar grey next but I know Godzilla is gonna win

On a serious note though, it’s got to be difficult dealing with something so bad that amputation is even on the table. I’m so sorry you had to go through that.

Neverbrokeabone,fedwptg,t3_eoiqpb,1579021497.0,When I was 4 I was running and I fell but didn’t put my hands out. Essentially going forehand first into the playground floor.

PewdiepieSubmissions,fe5w5js,t1_fe2wd5y,1578876289.0,I’m not the biggest fan of my physics teacher but I love physics. My class is “mixed” so there are a few kids who do not give a flying fuck about physics. So my teacher tells us to do the questions ok the sheet about the stuff we LITERALLY JUST LEARNED and they give up so he writes the answers on the board. It pisses me off because I want to learn and actually get the grades but as soon as it’s on the board I see it because I like to look around when I work (don’t ask why it just lets me clear my mind and start fresh if I don’t get something) so anyway I see the answers and oh look I’ve done the sheet while these kids aren’t actually writing anything so there was no point in writing the answers on the board in the first place. Rant over. All is chill and cool with the world

IllegalLifeProTips,fe3xs4s,t3_enn097,1578853851.0,My school uses this website called dafont.com and you can write something into it to test it out. So my school just screenshots and then pastes it into what ever we are doing. It’s pretty good as well. But if we didn’t do that we would have to pay for the fonts
gatekeeping,fe21qq6,t1_fe1z7vf,1578833543.0,"I’m a Brit so imma get the terms wrong but here goes nothing with my explanation 

The gun is a revolver so the bullets should go into the spiny thing in the middle. Revolvers use that (idk why but they do) and I think that’s why Russian roulette is a thing because of you only load 1 bullet there is a 1 in 6 chance to get shot where as if you use a glock let’s say, there is like a 99% chance of getting shot (gun might jam and not fire) but yeah revolvers don’t use magazines"
dataisbeautiful,fdyrzwb,t1_fdy4l0o,1578782974.0,"I mean England is technically the 5 wealthiest countries in the world right now (varies between 5 and 10 I think) but this graph puts it not even top 10 maybe 20. I know as a fact we have a homelessness problem and there isn’t enough space to build enough houses. It’s a small country with the same population as France (a much bigger country) this means that we have a load of very poor people Who are going to bring the median and mean down a lot (and yes I understand it may not be their fault but it is what it is.

To put that into perspective someone shat on the floor and the floor wasn’t cleaned and it was 800. 

Anything above 30 is considered unhygienic. So 5870 is FUCKIN AWFUL."
offmychest,fdlldrb,t1_fdll250,1578526645.0,"I think that the best part is the fact that they probably don’t understand how much it means to me when someone says that.

Keep being you bro:)"
offmychest,fdliucf,t1_fdkxq3k,1578524974.0,"Yupp. I got a compliment about my hair back in may 2019. I still remember it and I don’t even talk to the girl who said it anymore (other than passing conversation or a joke one of us says and the other laughs. We aren’t friends anymore though not by choice just we kinda grew apart. Nothing bad happened) but I still remember it...

You wanna know what this compliment was?

“Your hair isn’t that bad tbh”. That’s it. And i still remember it because we as humans are so starved for compliments because we probably think it will be seen as creepy or weird when we are just being nice.

But seriously it’s kinda sad that I still remember it. Especially since it wasn’t even a proper compliment it was just saying that it’s not too bad.

Edit: I just want to clarify in no way did I think she wanted me. Like I said before: we were just close friends nothing more nothing less but if OC sees this I’m hoping you don’t take this as someone who genuinely thought that she wanted me :) I didn’t. I just felt a little better about myself when it was said"

There is 1 thing I do disagree about though. You said it won’t affect us in any way but if WW3 starts and it’s a nuclear war. We will ALL be affected but I think that was just the wording of it so I ain’t gonna hold it against you. 

But yeah most I’ve seen are harmless saying they don’t want to go to war but from what you said you’ve seen it’s fuckin awful the jokes mocking the air strikes."
RocketLeague,fczop6r,t1_fcznefj,1578105831.0,Thanks :). My rotations are pretty decent but I think it’s just my defence and positioning.

miniminter,fczojch,t1_fczmrg8,1578105734.0,Mate. There is disliking a term or a phrase. I get that but Calling it gay is just kinda pathetic. You can’t think of any good insult about it you just decide to call it gay. If you hate something and want to voice your opinion at least have a valid reason and don’t just cal it “gay”

Dogfree,fc74key,t3_eggwu5,1577497358.0,"I saw this sub in a comment section and clicked it out of interest. This is my first post that I saw. I’m not going to join because I personally like dogs but this post I agree with. 

Don’t have a dog if you can’t control it or just don’t have too many dogs. They need space and also bonding time with the owner, having too many will make it so you can’t spend enough time with each dog and they will get jealous and shit.

It remind me of this woman whose house I walk past ok my way to school every day and I knew she had a few dogs (little yappy dogs. You know the ones) that don’t shut up and it was quite annoying until I saw her walking all of her dogs at once. IT WAS 12! 12 POMERANIANS! (I’ve misspelled that I think). And I just feel bad for them. They don’t shut up because they all want attention that this woman can’t give to them because she has too many. And it’s bad ownership"
