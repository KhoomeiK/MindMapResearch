Watches,ff3lw39,t1_ff3k891,1579543832.0,I'm extremely confused rn. I defenetly want something that looks modern (not that I don't like orients) and cool but I wouldn't feel very nice if I know that there is a dirt cheap quartz movement inside. I also don't want to break the bank so that makes a recipe for an non existing watch but I'm sure I'll find what I'm looking for at some point
