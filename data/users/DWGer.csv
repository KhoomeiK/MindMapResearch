relationships,ferc96x,t3_eqfq0p,1579352312.0,"You may be going a bit too far in chastising yourself here.  


Rather than replace yourself, start with placing yourself in her shoes in a truly honest, non-chastising way. That goes much further than an, admittedly kinda romantic, ""oof vy em ai zutch a kvlutz dumkopf"" routine.  


Relax, see if you can manage your time better with that thing around. Make plans with yourself and keep to them. If it really won't work, at least you've come to your very own conclusion.

When we decided to meet up I was heartbroken, and really needed something good, nice. First we canceled, because we both weren't really feeling it. Hell, I remember what she did that weekend.

But a few weeks later we met up for real, and I was very unsure about it all. Didn't find her all that attractive really - but I couldn't deny the unusual click and her utter cool relaxedness (this pretty much defines her, a man's dream) and when the weekend was done I realized there was something there.

From there on it took me about 3 to 6 months to really allow myself to ""feel it"". By the time I did she was the woman of my dreams.

Just saying, sometimes you really don't know. But you can feel. But not over the internet."

Question is, is it right for you to even be asking how to get him to like you. 

He must be very important to you, but I'm thinking you need to be important to you.

Even if you were to take him as your angle, how much good are the two of you going to be to each other this way?

He needs to understand that if he loves you in any way, and wants the best of you, he must build you up. Not break you down. 

If you can't get that in his head, or he won't budge, you must get out and rebuild yourself.

Whatever you choose you can do it. You've been through so much. But you need to set a course and if necessary sail it alone. But don't let others destroy you.

Best of luck!"
