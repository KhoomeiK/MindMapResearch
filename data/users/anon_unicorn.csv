TheOriginals,ffe8uc5,t3_et2fl7,1579839869.0,Davina’s name was spelled wrong on every question.
TheOriginals,ffdp0s2,t1_ffdjbu8,1579825574.0,1000 years is a really long time. Plus they’re from different packs. If you go by that logic that most relationships now are gross. According to Darwin and the Bible (whayever you believe in) the majority of people have a common ancestor but time is what causes genetics changes that later produce genetic variability. 1000 years is far enough away that they probably share very few traits.
bipolar2,ffbfhp9,t3_es6l25,1579763012.0,I love this.
bipolar2,ffbfep6,t3_eskdoi,1579762913.0,I’m not sure if I’m the right person to answer considering I’m in the same boat. But I would hold off on telling them until you know them well enough to know how they’ll react. Or if you have an episode then it’s always best to explain it then.
UBreddit,ffbe8b0,t1_ffa6i2w,1579761539.0,So now those elevators don’t go to both the 2nd and third floor.  This school is so weird.
AmItheAsshole,ffbdsla,t3_esn01a,1579761048.0,Yeah but that’s still weird to have a 9 year old babysit a 14 year old even with a disability.
TheOriginals,ffbd84f,t1_ffbcg7w,1579760416.0,I completely agree with you. You’re right I think that the only reason she did have feelings for him was because she knew he was one of the only guys she could date that Klaus wouldn’t try to kill. Though for someones who’s whole character arc is about wanting to find love I really wish she would’ve found it on the show with someone who really loves her.
AmItheAsshole,ffbajsh,t3_esn01a,1579757518.0,NTA you’re not equipped to babysit a special needs kid. It’s not fair to you or the kid. Though can I ask how old the kid is since it seems like you’ve been babysitting him for awhile but they let a 9 year old watch him?
AmItheAsshole,ffbaem3,t1_ffajecf,1579757327.0,I don’t think he’s homophobic. He’s probably just scared to tell his parents. Older people tend to be more judgmental when it comes to the LGBTQ community and he probably didn’t want his son to get hurt. Let him think the best of his grandparents.
AmItheAsshole,ffb9g69,t1_ffa88e9,1579756100.0,Ian Somerhalder is 41 and he was playing a teenager or 20 something until a few years ago.
TheOriginals,ffb6y66,t1_ffb1zak,1579753450.0,That’s what makes him like Klaus. He’s ruthless and power hungry. And he’s willing to dagger his family. Klaus daggered every single one of his siblings.  Though tbh I think he’s slightly worse than Klaus because at least Klaus cares about his family. And he didn’t subjugate a whole group of people.  Marcel was terrible to the witches and he betrayed the people who raised him.
bipolar2,ff3vilj,t3_er9x6m,1579549762.0,Thanks. I’m going to try. And wow your story sounds really similar to mine. I was also misdiagnosed with ADD and then depression. My doctor also prescribed seraqil and concerta when I was younger but my mom threw those out too.
progresspics,ff2nexd,t3_er6sra,1579514737.0,Whats OTF?
LegaciesCW,ff2mw4q,t1_ff29m8d,1579513925.0,Plus the hallow’s power nearly killed her the first time she absorbed it.
bipolar2,ff2mq26,t1_ff2mdzv,1579513661.0,Thanks I’m going to look into what shows up on the insurance bill. Thank you again.
LegaciesCW,ff2moj6,t1_fezfzk7,1579513592.0,It’s true. They don’t seem to really know how to act in the real world. I’m not sure what they’ll do when they graduate though I’m sure we’ll find out soon. Hope is 17 so I don’t know how long they can keep the show running before she graduates. Hopefully we’ll get see what happens afterwards.
LegaciesCW,ff2mf9u,t1_ff25k2c,1579513194.0,Plus the second rule of a CW show is. It’s okay if they’re dead. They’ll come back.
bipolar2,ff2mau8,t1_ff2l890,1579513001.0,"I’m 18 but I’m on her insurance so she sees it and she threatened to stop helping me pay for my schooling if I took the meds. I know this sounds stupid but being away from her, and going to school, working towards something is the only thing that matters to me. I can’t give that up."
UBreddit,ff2gq6d,t3_epu7ub,1579505405.0,It’s fine. I did it. They’re mailing out the book sometime next week.
UBreddit,ff2gn44,t3_eqqx24,1579505303.0,Another fact about UB. No one follows any of those dorm rules. My bed was pushed against the heater last year and my roommate had string lights and candles.
UBreddit,ff2fuaa,t1_ff2986c,1579504343.0,I did the same thing. I literally just moved back into the dorms yesterday. It’s depressing living in the off campus apartments.
bipolar,ff2ej4m,t3_er602w,1579502856.0,And the second one is screaming “are you calling me ugly?” back at you.
college,fezclbw,t3_eqyozz,1579455973.0,Usually between 15-19. A lot of the science classes are 4-5 credits.
TheOriginals,fewnad1,t1_fc930l7,1579415550.0,"Marcel was just as bad as Klaus if not worse. He pretty much tortured the witches. He was insanely power hungry and took every chance he could to try and take Klaus’s place even though Klaus saved him and raised him. Klaus is not innocent either, he’s the reason Marcel is the way he is. He learned it from him. He read him hamlet and the art of war as bedtime stories as a kid no wonder he’s like that. Still Marcel is just as bad and has killed his fair share of innocents. The difference is Klaus has a kid and it would’ve better if it was Marcel so at least Hope would still have one parent. I get why they made it so Klaus had to die though. One to free up hope for legacies and two because it completes Klaus’s redemption arc. The ultimate sacrifice."
TheOriginals,fewmjw4,t1_fe54foy,1579414747.0,Marcel wasnt the good guy early on. Yes the witches were in the wrong and yes he did save davina but he did keep the witches oppressed. Not all of the witches were in on the harvest ritual many of them were against it including Sophie and he went around killing them indiscriminately for using magic. He also kicked out all of the wolves. He was power hungry and wanted complete control over the quarter. And He oppressed and entire group of people to do that. Plus he used Davina to attack the witches. Of course she was eager to help since she just watched them murder her friends and then try to sacrifice her as well but she was also 16. Marcel killed any of the witches she reported using magic. Because of Marcel she had blood on her hands at 16.
LegaciesCW,fewlg9d,t1_fczeo24,1579413590.0,Omg there has to be a fairy in one of these episodes.
LegaciesCW,fewlejn,t3_ejkal2,1579413542.0,"Supernatural college! 
On a serious note I agree with you I feel like for a show that came after the originals it was a bad idea to make it target a younger audience. There’s so much history and darkness in that universe and the show would have so much potential if it tapped into that instead of the monster of the week."
LegaciesCW,fewivij,t3_ek1pnj,1579411439.0,I would also chose witch. I mean they can do almost anything. Plus they were the ones who created vampires and wear wolves in the first place.
LegaciesCW,fewii87,t1_fdcqd3t,1579411224.0,Right? I was worried about that too. I’m hoping she’ll be able to keep them since the argument in the TVD was the magic was all about keeping the balance of nature and vampires were unnatural. But Hope was a natural born vampire so it might be different with her.
LegaciesCW,fewibxr,t1_fdxnx3s,1579411114.0,Yeah. I liked when they had more human (and by human and I mean like one of the main three species) villains. Like Hope is incredibly powerful so were her parents. She can destroy a monster in five seconds. They’re not smart and they’re not even remotely human so there’s no remorse or moral battles when she has to kill them. It’s easy. It’d be better to have a smart morally ambiguous villain like Kai or Klaus.
LegaciesCW,fewh7wo,t3_ekzl73,1579410535.0,I really want to Klaus or one of the originals. Even though Klaus and Elijah died they can bring them back in memories or as ghosts. Plus hope still has other family. Freya and Rebekah cared about her so much in TO it’s hard to imagine they’ll just leave her on her own. She also seemed to be close to Kol and Davina in season 5. It’s weird that she says she has no family. They should come on the show. TO was all about family and it’d be terrible to see this family bonds end now the Klaus and Elijah aren’t around to hold them together.
LegaciesCW,fewfkdf,t3_emkek5,1579409761.0,This is amazing. It’s be so much better if the originals was on there though.
LegaciesCW,fewd9rk,t3_eqnfka,1579408686.0,Am I the only one who doesn’t love Penelope. I don’t hate I just feel like we don’t know much about her. Whenever she’s on screen it’s usually when Lizzie and Josie are calling her the devil. Like she had a few good moments trying to help Josie get out of Lizzie’s shadow but that was one episode and then she’s kind of forgotten. The rest of the characters on the show are a lot more developed.
bipolar2,fewc3wt,t1_feudi6a,1579408203.0,Yeah the gym always helps me.
AskDocs,fevw9ys,t3_epye4w,1579402230.0,Yeah but you need to have the school insurance to use it.
Advice,fenaqvf,t1_fen580r,1579280662.0,I think the problem is he’s not sure it’s a reliable source. It’s hard to believe a friend can do that.  Plus if he has a common name it’s very possible it’s a different person on the list.
AskDocs,fen6od4,t1_femhbob,1579278153.0,I can’t I don’t have insurance plus it takes months to see one and I’m away at college.
LegaciesCW,femaiza,t1_femag3x,1579246039.0,That makes sense. Plus I just saw a video on this subreddits where Hope gets a roommate.
LegaciesCW,fem9dwx,t3_eo5s95,1579244629.0,I love how their personalities are the opposite of the characters. Like Lizzie would be a slytherin and Josie would be a hufflepuff.
LegaciesCW,fem7yn8,t3_epvx33,1579243025.0,That is sweet. I love how her relationship with the twins grew over the last two seasons especially Lizzie. There was a lot of character development for both of them. On a side note. I always wondered why Hope doesn’t have a roommate. It seems like everyone else on the show does.
Advice,fem7rcv,t3_epv1ih,1579242810.0,It sounds like he’s depressed. It might help if you can convince him to talk to someone. A trained therapist would be able to do so much more for him than you can. Even if it’s not depression a therapist will be able to help him get to the roots of his problem. All you can do is be there for him and show him you care about him.
bipolar2,fem7gyi,t3_epuhbn,1579242503.0,I feel like that too. But usually I’m the one who pushed them away. During depressive episodes I cancel plans and don’t want to do anything. Sometimes people get tired of being the one to reach out. That’s why when you’re manic you feel like you have more friends. Because you’re constantly talking and reaching out to them. Don’t feel bad. Reach out to one of your friends I’m sure they’ll answer.
college,fehqjiz,t3_ep10sw,1579121878.0,😂True. I’m just really bored. I’m going back early and working there.
Advice,fegh4gf,t3_ep0xml,1579092574.0,"I know how you feel. I felt like that a lot in high school. It might be time to find new friends. If you’re in college or high school join a club if not take an art class, or a dance class, find something where you can meet people who share common interests with you. You’re not stuck with the same friends who treat you badly. If you’re not their first choice you don’t need them."
Advice,feggljs,t3_eoyzc4,1579092081.0,I was a lot like you in high school. I think most kids are. High school is just awful and like you said there’s a mental health crisis now with social media and everyone comparing themselves to each other. Try to find a hobby outside of school. That helped me. It’ll give you something to look forward to. Also don’t stress too much about what you want to major in college. I’m a sophomore and college and still don’t know.
Teacher,fegfoxp,t3_enb2en,1579091200.0,"When it doubt, I call them Sarah. I had five Sarah last year. Can’t go wrong."
Advice,fegfhb1,t3_eow5ry,1579090990.0,I get that. Working is a lot on top of being a full time student. I have a part time job and an internship and it’s a lot to juggle. The best thing to do would be to take out loans. And I know you probably don’t want to hear this but have you considered putting your YouTube channel on the back burner and just work on it over breaks? It might help free up some time for you. I had to give up a lot of my hobbies in college too. It’s not fair but it’s the best option.
AmItheAsshole,fege2nv,t3_eozmwi,1579089482.0,"NTA, I could never shave my head either. I’m surprised everyone that you work with did. Cutting your hair won’t help your coworker and you can find other ways of supporting him."
AmItheAsshole,fegdisw,t3_eoo84b,1579088853.0,NTA you’re mom sounds awful. You should talk to a guidance counselor or teacher about it in school and see if they could speak to her or something about it.
Advice,fegd5io,t3_eouc5l,1579088412.0,It depends on what you wear. If you wear thick or baggy shirts you should be fine. I doubt anyone would notice unless they’re staring directly at your chest.
Advice,fegczxf,t3_ep0it4,1579088225.0,"I think it might be a good opportunity for you. I used to be really shy too, to the point where I threw up the one and only time I had to speak in front of the class in high school. My senior year my English teacher forced me into a drama class where I had to speak and preform in front of people every day. It was terrifying and embarrassing but by the end I wasn’t scared of public speaking anymore. It’s important to face your fears and to get out of your comfort zone. The position might not be the one you had in mind but it might be the one you need."
Advice,fegcssy,t3_eow5ry,1579087985.0,Don’t feel bad. You’re not weak at all. Most people I know in their 20s still live at home and paying for college is hard. The best thing to do would be to talk to the financial aide office about getting a student loan and maybe taking a part time job or work study job to help pay for it.
Advice,fegclvs,t3_eoj7pv,1579087751.0,It’s hard. The same thing happened to me with my best friend except he started dating my roommate. We were in weird terms after that for awhile but then I realized that our friendship was worth more. If you’re with her and you feel like you’re falling for her again just try to ignore it. It’s not worth losing a friend. Maybe go out on a date with someone else. That might help you move on.
college,fegc5qw,t3_ep01di,1579087186.0,You should make sure they’re not replacing your roommate this semester before you do anything. My roommate left in fall semester last year and they put someone new in my room when I came back in the spring.
college,fegc2k9,t3_eomjwv,1579087073.0,It depends on the classes I’m taking. For math and math based science classes I don’t usually study as much. But for biology and concept heavy classes I try to record the lectures and rewatch them after class and take notes that way I can just listen in class. I also take a few hours on the weekend to read the textbook chapters for the week. And for all of my classes math or not I usually look for practice questions or problems.
college,fc2al35,t3_efsmfi,1577348808.0,Don’t be nervous. College is an amazing experience. Just make sure you’re doing all the assignments and keeping up with the lectures and you’ll be good academically. Socially if you’re in a big school it can be hard to make friends. Join clubs and form study groups with people in your classes. It’ll it make it much easier to make friends.
Advice,fc2ad8e,t1_fc2a7nz,1577348443.0,Np! Hope it turns out well.
Advice,fc2a2km,t1_fc2a0lr,1577347946.0,I get that. You probably just have a lot of pressure on you. Don’t worry too much about it. Just have fun playing the game.
Advice,fc2a0r2,t1_fc29wdu,1577347863.0,I get that. Maybe trying asking him about it in a way that makes it seem like you don’t care either way. Maybe you can mention that you’re still getting messages or matches on tinder and see what he says.
Advice,fc29vhb,t3_efstdk,1577347627.0,Practice. Exercise a lot and set small goals for yourself. Try seeing if you can run an extra mile or do add a few more seconds to a plank. Maybe you’ll feel better when you accomplish one of those things. It’s a start at building up confidence again. But don’t worry about losing. Everyone loses once in awhile. It’s not your fault.
Advice,fc29rqo,t3_efsshk,1577347462.0,Maybe you should talk to him about it.
Advice,fc29lii,t1_fc29j3c,1577347186.0,I’ve done all of that. Read every book I have. Watched a season of lost. Started MCAT studying. I just need to see another person.
BipolarReddit,fc29byq,t3_cns7s4,1577346761.0,I’m in the phase right now too. What usually helps me is creating small goals and trying to accomplish them. Maybe tell yourself you’re going to go to the gym today or that you’re going to get at least one of your homework assignments done and try to do it. When you do you’ll start to feel a little better.
