KansasCityChiefs,ffusmwg,t1_ffurx5m,1580248588.0,"I guarantee you that SF hasn't seen anything like KC's offense either :)

I mean, this same team in the last two years has played the Ravens twice (and beaten them twice), the Patriots three times (and beaten them in Foxborough), the Titans, the Bears, etc. No one has slowed down the offense (though last year teams were able to outscore us even if we put up 50 points). They've seen some decent defenses."
KansasCityChiefs,ffusa6w,t1_ffuronb,1580248407.0,"The Chiefs have that game too, with short passes to Kelce and a great screen game, plus some pretty decent running at times. But if you find yourself 24 points down in the beginning of the second quarter and want to take a lead into the half . . . SF can't pull that off. 

You don't need to throw to Tyreek and Mecole to use them to your advantage -- let them take the safeties 50 yards down field and pull a delayed run or an intermediate pass. And they keep LB's off the field because you need DBs to be able to cover them, so those short passes to a guy like Kelce can turn into 15 yards pretty quickly."

If people can worship in the open and state their beliefs, but live peacefully with all of their neighbors that's a fair compromise. As Jefferson said, it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg.

But it has to be mutual respect. They have to respect non-believers rights too. So we can't have laws (or wars) justified by someone's religious beliefs. We can't pass laws to protect things that only their religion says is a human, we can't take official actions to encourage an environment where the rapture can occur, etc."

No. You can calculate the extra weight on the tires when it's sitting, but when it's driving you aren't just pulling the extra weight sitting on the TRUCK's tires, you are pulling the extra weight that sitting on the trailer's tires too. Think about a wagon (like a little kid's toy wagon). Now imagine you have loaded it up with books, or something really heavy.

You don't stop Mahomes per se -- you have to stop all of his receivers. If Tyreek Hill is open Mahomes can get him the ball. Same with Kelce. Same with Sammy Watkins or D-Rob or Mecole Hardman. You have to stop all of those receivers, and every time one slips by you it's a big play. It's almost like having 5 Derick Henry's that you have to stop on each play."
nfl,feonp6l,t1_feon32n,1579302613.0,That takes me back to the comment that started this whole thread -- We lost to the Texans in the regular season too.
nfl,feom9o7,t1_feolfgl,1579302038.0,"OK, you got me. There was some hyperbole in there. I don't expect the Chiefs to score 50 points this week. I know the Chiefs are going to struggle to tackle Henry, and he's going to break off some big runs. What else do you want me to say? Am I allowed to believe my team is going to win despite being favored by 7 points, or do I have to give that up too?"
nfl,feol6n5,t1_feok6yp,1579301687.0,"I didn't literally say every single drive, I said to make sure the titans punt ""a few times.""

And yeah, there was definitely some trash talk in there. Henry's a beast and I have no question he'll get some 50 yard runs. But I think the Chiefs will get a few 50 yard plays too. I think the Titans will burn a lot more clock and it will be a good close game -- but I think the Chiefs can score more points, even if they have less time to do it. That's my point."

nfl,feojzvx,t1_feoh731,1579301234.0,We played the Texans in the regular season too.
nfl,feo7i5r,t1_feo745a,1579296204.0,"I hear you, but I kind of want to dismiss the Pats win. I know that minimizes the Chiefs' win in Foxboro this year just as much. But that did not feel like the Pats of old. The DOLPHINs beat them. In Foxboro. In DECEMBER."

""Yes, I get that, I mean . . . oh never mind."""
nfl,feo6sog,t1_feo62iq,1579295887.0,"I don't question any of that. I was just responding to ""they literally already beat the Chiefs this year.""

If that's all that matters, why bother to play the game at all? I was just saying the same argument worked for the Texans last week -- they literally already beat the Chiefs this year. That's not all that goes into who's favored in the game."
nfl,feo5kxf,t1_fenjpsc,1579295427.0,">That was the defending Superbowl champs and  the 2019 Ravens they beat.

The Chiefs actually beat both of those teams in the regular season too. Those Patriots were not even the 2018 Patriots. I'm impressed by the Ravens win though -- Baltimore had really come on since the Chiefs beat them earlier in the year. That was a solid game from the Titans."
nfl,feo57d9,t1_fenkdfi,1579295295.0,"So did the Texans. The Chiefs had a range in the middle of the season with a lot of injuries. They're playing differently now than they were then.

Having said that, so are the Titans. The two teams are so different from each other that it's hard to even picture how the game goes. If it goes like a regular Chiefs game, it won't be close. If it goes like a regular Titans game, it will be close but the Titans win."
nfl,feo4ipd,t1_fenv15h,1579295026.0,That's frickin' hard to come back from. I can just imagine the pouty face Rivers would make if he read this.
nfl,feo47ss,t1_fenwoag,1579294935.0,"Exactly. All we need to do is make sure the Titans punt a few times. Even if Henry eats up a ton of clock each drive, we still get the ball back at the end of it. If we get the ball an equal number of times and we score every time and they don't, the rest doesn't matter."
nfl,feo3wcw,t1_fenpttl,1579294763.0,"Oh, why don't they have a first? (Just kidding, I figured I'd try and beat the dead horse a little bit more)"
nfl,feo2gom,t1_fenyo4k,1579294194.0,">Just didn't pick him earlier because they weren't really looking for a QB.

And why pick him earlier if you don't have to? If you are pretty sure you can get him in the 6th, why use a 2 on him?"
nfl,feo1jgn,t1_fenr4t0,1579293872.0,"If Cutler was as talented as Rodgers he wouldn't have had to play smarter, he would have been able to land some of those throws."
