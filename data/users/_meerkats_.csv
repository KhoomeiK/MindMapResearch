Advice,ff0thv2,t3_eqyle2,1579472122.0,"Congrats on your scholarship!
I would definitely attend school now, don't miss this opportunity.
Just take out a student loan to pay for you to live on campus. This is an investment in your future, you've earned it.

You will meet people on campus that you could possibly share an apartment with the next semester. Get a group of classmates together and get a job while in school to pay the rent. If not, just go the student loan route. The stress your grandparents will put you through may affect your ability to do the best you can in your classwork. You need to focus on your education.  Also, don't go the gap year route. 

You only get one chance at this. If you pass up free tuition, you may not get another offer. Good luck!"

I actually think you should charge her the full amount for the painting that was ruined. 
I would also charge her the money it is now costing you since you are behind on the rest of your work.

How would she feel if she got her paycheck and she wasn't paid for 15 hours of work? Tell her that.

Her kid shouldn't have been there in the first place. Since she chose not to follow that one simple rule, he should have been by her side the entire night

This is your profession, and you need to be compensated. Especially since you are now behind on all of your work."

sex,fel6xg0,t3_elap7e,1579215369.0,"Other things that can cause pain during sex are different times in your menstrual cycle, or things like vaginal yeast or vaginal bacterial infections. A visit to the doctor and simple tests can diagnose this. While you may feel embarrassed to mention it to your partner, it's best to inform them. Yeast infections can cause itching and burning on both the inside and the outside. Just telling them ""don't touch my vaginal area for a week"" with no explanation can be confusing for them. I say, my gynecologist prescribed me Diflucan for a vaginal yeast infection, it's a pill, and told me not to have sex for (however many days they told you)"". Let's make out/sensual massage/whatever you both like to do for the next few days. Sexual wellness is just a important and sexual pleasure. Make sure to listen to your body."
sex,fel62lb,t3_elap7e,1579214838.0,"Communication is so important both before and during sex. Talk with your new partner, I usually do it when we are in bed just starting to touch each other (but that's just me). It's surprising how much most men (even experienced ones) don't know about what women need sexually. I've been told by several men that they wish their former sexual partners would have told them about all these things, instead of just saying nothing.

If we've had sex before and they didn't do enough foreplay I tell them straight out and to the point. ""Women need to have lots of foreplay before sex or it will most likely be painful for me, this is the same for all women"". Then I tell them the things they can do that turn me on, in a flirty and fun way, (and show them how sometimes which turns both of us on).

Men can't read our minds. They could be doing something that they think will turn you on (or has turned their other sexual partners in the past) but does absolutely nothing for you. This is normal, everyone is different.

Importantly, what many others have said, tell them immediately if what they are doing is causing you pain and take a pause or a break. Take your time."
ExNoContact,fef0b0g,t3_eolxm6,1579045179.0,Those pieces of you they miss are probably bigger than they realized. My hobbies are really important to me and we talked about them all the time. Everywhere they go outside and see it (or hear it) they will think of me and realize what they lost.

ExNoContact,fdzibxo,t3_enewth,1578790509.0,"Once you contact your ex, she will have the upper hand in the relationship. There is no relationship anymore, that was her choice. Don't let her pick and choose to bring you into and out of her life whenever she needs help, or is lonely, etc. Don't give her that satisfaction.

As for worrying about her, she is an adult, she can take care of herself. You're doing good, stay strong."

AskReddit,fdmpb7b,t3_elzbiv,1578559159.0,"Snow is miserable.

The only thing nice about it is that it looks pretty when everything is blanketed in a fresh layer of snow.

It is literally freezing outside, it can bury you inside your house. Grew up in the Midwest, over day I opened the door and there was a wall of snow 4 feet deep. Had to wait for the city to shovel everyone out.

Forget about having nice shoes, you need to wear snow boots and bring your extra pair of work shoes to work. 

Digging your car out several times a day. 
Especially on your way to work. Forget about that shower you took this morning. You are now dropping with sweat in freezing temperatures every morning after digging your car out. Your windshield ice up."

dating_advice,fckpa6f,t3_eho31b,1577730253.0,"To be honest, and this is always hard to hear...
If someone tells you ""they aren't ready"", many times it means they aren't ready for you (in particular)
In the other cases, no need to sit around waiting for them to be ready (they may never be). We don't deserve it, life is too short. Get out and find someone that is excited to be with you.
I couldn't agree more with the title of the post."
