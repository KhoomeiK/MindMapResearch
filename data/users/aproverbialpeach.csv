Skinny, always been skinny, always been very active, always enjoyed weightlifting, I hate fatphilics telling me how jealous they are that I generally try to eat as much as possible, like me getting nauseous easily and avoiding food when anxious and stressed is something I’ve dealt with my whole life, and yet I still don’t eat sweets or fast food or drink soda because it aggravates my nausea and fatphilics just act like I have it made in the shade and I hate it. I don’t think they can even understand that I feel frustrated and self conscious about my lack of progress while still doing my best to take care of myself because I’m athletic looking. Like oh yeah once I looked in a mirror when I was 12 and was just like yep good enough and it’s been nothing but Big Macs and Swiss rolls since then and that’s all it takes to look like an underwear model according to their lies about genetic inevitability. Just because I’m skinny doesn’t mean I automatically have and act upon latent repressed desires to eat garbage and lay around all day every day. In fact I’d be worried if I did. 

I get that they can’t imagine being healthy because it’s rare that they ever were in the same way I can’t imagine being obese because I would take corrective action long before that happened so in a way I think we’re all doomed to never understand the other side, except the people that cross over (congrats if you’re one!) but jeez it’s like they’re trying to gatekeep feeling anything about one’s body at all, like the only true contentment is being obese and fine with it (which I personally think is impossible) because if anyone’s ever fit they’re a victim of diet culture and their experience is invalid, following that logic only the fattest person in the world at any given point is the true woke one? Lol the only thing the scale measures is the damage society has or hasn’t done? Absolutely mental. Meanwhile the fits have to pay for the fats because it’d be ableist and discriminatory for insurance companies to take into account even basic health metrics when calculating premiums, so yes, their weight is my problem!

Quite to the contrary, healthy food access is very much intertwined with income levels, and even furthermore it *is* possible to be against both things simultaneously. your comment is a total red herring and I personally believe obese people should feel every bit the social shame that we freely provide smokers, people who drive obscenely large trucks, or who shoot heroin, who, notably, don’t complain as much as fat people. 

The alternatives are that they pay a premium on top of the normal tax based on an evaluation of their additional risk factors but I’m sure you’d complain about that too.

I’d encourage you to think laterally here, what skill sets can you gain that would be useful in the broader market? It may not be to your benefit to immediately jump on the first midnight gas station attendant gig you can get just to get out of the house, and there are also other ways to create that income for yourself at home for quick cash if nothing else is becoming available, such as transcription services, translation services, mechanical Turk stuff, and these you can do while upskilling yourself through things like coding (codeacademy and w3schools are great, and the popular science online store also has some extremely affordable certification courses for things like azure, cyber security, and cisco ccna) if college is not something that’s on the table for you right now. These kinds of skills don’t require previous knowledge and the jobs associated with them would either help you move to the city or allow you to work remotely if that’s your preference, while less and less of them are requiring 4 year degrees. 

Attitude is everything! I have a great job in the field and never completed a degree. Be a self-starter and keep your long term goals in mind, no one will give it to you but no one will stop you either. Take care"

So according to you, god intentionally deceives us to make his existence seem more unlikely than is necessary. That, on its own, defeats the “three legged stool” of omnipotence, omnibenevolence, and omniscience, in that a benevolent god would not deceive their creation intentionally and then punish them for eternity being deceived. That’s my conclusion anyway, but hey ~mysterious ways~ amirite? 

Also an infinite punishment for a finite crime is maybe a little disproportionate?

Anyway if you ever want to try your hand at debating any of the other numerous points I’ve made feel free, especially regarding Pascal’s wager I find it interesting that you believe the only correct religion to wager your soul on is the one you were probably raised in, what a miraculous coincidence! I’m also curious if you believe that we are able to enter the gates of heaven through works, accepting JC as our lord and savior, or both, and if people who have not heard the word and never will according to his plan are saved, as there seems to be some conflict in the good book about that.. maybe next time."
