LawSchool,fejfirz,t3_epgmnl,1579171731.0,"Maybe the industry isn't ""anti you."" Maybe you're just a bad interviewer. That's something that can be fixed without going to law school. 

Also, if law school is your plan B and you're only doing it just to do something, it's probably not worth it. You're going to run into the exact same problems when finding a job, except you'll feel a lack of fulfillment because it's not your passion or primary interest. You mentioned in a comment you don't really want to go to law school - I think you answered your own question. The job market isn't any better, so why torture yourself and go into debt?"

pics,fcaulse,t1_fcakjwp,1577576922.0,The implications of a juror learning about a hung jury in a previous trial are significantly different from a juror learning details of plea negotiations. The federal rules of evidence (and most or all state law rules) make a huge deal out of plea negotiations between the defense and the prosecution being confidential and inadmissible. It's grounds for a mistrial if the prosecution reveals details of the negotiation.
