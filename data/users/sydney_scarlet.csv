If you’re not close to anyone join classes or something to meet people. Go to a drawing or acting class there are so many friendly people there."
depression,fcslomw,t3_eikk9a,1577919176.0,"I look at life different. The reason I am alive is because I was the fastest swimmer. Jk but actually the reason I get out of bed every day is to change someone’s life. To make someone proud. To meet new people and to inspire change in someone. Everyone has changed someone for the better or worse. Make sure it’s the right thing. 

Also if you wanna get lost in life if you think about it we are just a brain telling everything in our body to do something. We are all particles running into other particles. Lowkey trippy."
depression,fcqz37d,t3_ei9s4u,1577894366.0,"I’d rather be alone and in bed happy than forcing myself to be around people who don’t give a damn about me. Who cares about other people. If you feel sad that you’re at home, go out. If you are perfectly happy being in bed, stay there. Who’s in the right to judge you for being you? I sure as hell am not and no one else is either."
