BlackPeopleTwitter,fgh1l0b,t1_fgh13ts,1580774514.0,"I have a good friend who moved to NC while being a master electrician. He went from making 100k a year to barely making 30k due to lack of unions. Luckily the situation that forced him to move ended and he went back to making good money in the NE. I can understand why people wouldn’t want to work their hands to the bone for that kind of pay, especially since there was no shortage of work for him. The amount of times he had contracts be stiffed because he’d have to go to court himself was staggering."
facepalm,fgh13ix,t1_fggxcti,1580774186.0,Yeah prairie dogs still carry it asymptotically. I don’t think there have been any deaths in the cases where it had happened because it’s responsive to antibiotics.
facepalm,fgh0wt6,t1_fggux7w,1580774061.0,"I mean there’s a lot technically wrong beyond just being a bad example. The Black Plague is still in existence, there have been cases in the American South West in the last decade. It’s a bacteria so antibiotics save the infected. As such a vaccine is for a virus, not bacterial infection.

Edit: apparently my last statement is not accurate and there are anti bacteria vaccines. I should have remembered this since I’ve been vaccinated for anthrax which is also a bacteria. I’ll leave it for posterity’s sake."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fggy6iq,t1_fggednc,1580772221.0,"Actually there is a huge demand right now with most of the boomers leaving the job market. Gen X and millennials were pushed away from the trades for many of the reasons you illustrated. Because of that, there is a deficit of available work force. It also doesn’t help that a lot of states have killed unions, particularly those that have had Red Governors."

Don’t try to take direct fights and stay at max non charged sticky range for fights. If your spamming stickies you can hold down mouse 2 for instant detonation once they arm.

NewToTF2,fgcjwml,t1_fgcfrtx,1580673297.0,"I’d agree for the primary but secondary is totally built around play style. Stock is the best pure dps but that obviously requires decent aim. Winger is better for a flank heavy play style as the utility of higher jumps gets you into some interesting places. Pocket pistol can help you tank a little extra damage or melt instantly depending on who you’re playing against. Milk is good for being supportive of the team, especially if they have heavier damage classes with pocket medics.

NewToTF2,ffgpvh5,t1_ffgerkp,1579912033.0,"This is the best answer. A bad soldier will be pretty OP against other bad players. A good Soldier can neutralize most players or leave pretty easily if they are in trouble.

It compares changes in requirements and equipment that will make you question that theory. I’m not convinced it holds up in the realm of a team sport where there is more strategy and counter play, but he makes a good argument for individual athletic ability with Track and Swimming.

BlackPeopleTwitter,ffflgyh,t1_fffkgjv,1579886525.0,"I think era wise this is a positive question, but when you look at all time it becomes more of a normative question because sports change substantially over time. Wilt Chamberlain was the most dominant player statistically in basketball, but things like offensive goal tending, free throw plane, widening of the key, and inbounding were all changed to keep him from being as dominant. So how to you equate the game now versus then? I don’t think there is any way without adding bias to the equation."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fffkt7i,t1_fffjtg9,1579886119.0,"Probably not without major changes to the game. Players are all full professionals, Goalies are better equipped, and rules have changed. It’s also why we will never have a team like the Bill Russell era Cetics."

AskReddit,feovu1b,t1_fen7sbt,1579306506.0,"Yeah there was definitely a lot of skill involved in winning certain matchups. If you’re playing Alliance vs Hierarchy full roster match ups you could get away with just maximizing damage based on the ship. Like the Shofixi vs a Dreadnaught is a huge disadvantage, but you could land a few good shots and get a point blank glory device then it was a great trade since it’s one of, if not the most powerful ships in the game."
AskReddit,fem17qv,t1_felyxtg,1579236455.0,"I’m glad my brother didn’t hustle me out of my allowance. 

But it is amazing how each ship was so unique. I compare it a lot to the class based/ hero shooters we see how. Both SC and SC 2 had every ship be unique and distinct, but you have games like paladins and overwatch that, while having some unique ideas, generally have a number of boring hitscan characters or sniper tropes that are invariably replaceable. A lot could be learned from star control in that aspect."

I went to undergrad at a decent public school and paid 38k over 4 years (not including scholarships). My graduate school tuition at a top tier private school was 47k a semester, while the education was better, I’m sure it was not over 10 times better as the cost would suggest."
AskReddit,felh4z6,t1_fel1w4m,1579222048.0,It was on the PC too. My older brother and I used to play melee instead of the full game all the time. It was surprisingly high skill with certain ships having unique abilities.
truetf2,feiac6d,t1_fei8fef,1579133848.0,"I agree that pyro fits in a weird space. The only uniqueness the class has is in Uber denial due to airblast, and that obviously was a post release change. 

I think the speed increase would make the pyro similar to the original release back burner, where they can be pocketed in to murder non mobile classes without much skill or effort. 

I always though a buff to the detonator jump would be better. I feel like the jet pack isn’t effective enough to get in and out, where as buffing you detonator to get to the top of the crates on granary would add interesting mobility, especially since det jumping requires skill than the jet pack, and causes damage to the pyro."

truetf2,fdlebvm,t3_elzel8,1578522198.0,"Most early leagues had multiple formats. 8v8, 5v5, and 6v6 were all hold outs from previous games like team fortress classic and natural selection. As games were played in the now dead leagues (Stronger than All for example) changes to the format were made. First 5s was dropped, then crits were dropped, then 8s. What was the nail in the coffin was the CEVO  Sennheiser $1000 Tournament chose 6v6 with 1 medic and 1 demo as the format. 

The doctors, a team of old Quake players won then promptly left TF2. The second placed team, The Experiment became the powerhouse for the time with a number of players that became the staple of the community in the early days, Dummy, Reptile,

NewToTF2,fdf9s5m,t3_el2jzc,1578356635.0,"Pretty vague question and with no frame of reference it is difficult to answer, but I’ll try.

Certain classes are better in more situations than others. At a high level Soldier, Demo, Scout, and Medic are the strongest, but in casual, and for a beginner Soldier, Heavy, and Pyro are pretty straight forward and can contribute even if you don’t understand a lot yet. More Soldiers and Heavies are never a bad thing. Demo, and Scout require a lot of skill to be good, and medic requires a certain understanding of the game to be useful. Spy, engineer, and sniper have their place, but generally they aren’t direct combat classes and have substantial diminishing returns the more there are on a team. If you already have two on the team consider switching to soldier, heavy, or pyro.

Maps generally are color coded and have arrow pointing where to go. As the game progresses where you respawn moves forward or backward depending on if you’re winning or loosing. Most maps are meant to favor the attacking team on payload, and the winning team on Capture Points.

Try to play Payload, and Capture Point maps. They are the typically the best in line with the gameplay as it is. Attack and Defend and Capture the Flag are typically remnants of how the game used to be and are prone to stale mates. Avoid Goldrush, and Hoodoo for payload as well as they are poorly designed maps. Upward, Badwater Basin, Borneo, Mountain Lab, Barn Blitz,  and Thunder Mountain are all pretty good to play. Payload is more straightforward because you push a cart along a designated track. 

The casual game has a pretty wide breadth of players. You’ll get people who can solo fight against most of the team because of their skill and people not able to aim and move at the same time."

The Shia attacked beyond the the Mahdi Army, but it was substantially less than the Sunni attacks. Iran was actually helping us in Afghanistan until GWB’s Axis of Evil speech. That being said, the level of sophistication and materials in EFP IED definitely was tied to Iran. 

Don’t get me wrong. America has a long history of fucking with Iran and I can completely see their reasoning for retaliatory attacks, but they definitely attacked US personnel through proxies and directly."
