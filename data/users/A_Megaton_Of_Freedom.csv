There were many cases of people joining the military so they could transition under the military's healthcare system.

I'm personally in favour of M4A but you shouldn't join the military just to exploit it.

Additionally, trans individuals often have other health issues like depression, especially when they have not transitioned or when they regret doing so - which is quite common amongst younger folks, towards military recruitment is targeted. And good luck receiving the appropriate care when deployed overseas.

Do I think trans individuals should be banned from the military for these reasons? Probably not, I'm not an expert. There's certainly issues I am not aware of and haven't considered.

I'd advise to CCP* it until you know much more about finance and such, but the best way to learn is to actually have at it. So you might want to experiment and learn along the way, with the funds that aren't in a registered account. 

The benefit is that if you make losses on a given year, you can use those losses to reduce the tax burden in future years. (In a registered account, you wouldn't pay taxes anyway, so losses are just very bad, and do not allow you to contribute more)

Additional piece of advice for stocks: Buy low sell high is bullshit.   So is Buy the dip. You don't buy the dip, you buy the undervalued and sell the over-valued. The practical result is that even if you pay 100$ for a stock, if it drops to 90$, you shouldn't wait for it to get ""high"" back to 100$ to break even. That's the sunken cost fallacy.

What you need to do is evaluate whether the price it is at right now is appropriate, or above/below what it should be. That requires a lot of reading, which most people do not consistently have time for. 

As for buying the dip, you may do that if it equates to buying a stock you had been watching and now know is undervalued. Ex: I bought TSLA went it down after we'd seen Elon Musk smoke pot on JRE. That was a good decision because I knew the company and knew selling shares on the basis of the CEO smoking pot was bullshit.

I also bought BA after the second 737 MAX crash. That was a terrible decision because I didn't know how shitty Boeing's corporate culture was. 

Now of course the goal is to buy low sell high, but that's like telling a football player to land more touchdowns. ""Yeah thanks mate, hadn't considered that before /s"".


Oh and, options are enticing but don't forget that options buyers are wrong 75% of the time. But I'm getting in the weeds here...

And don't put money in stocks if you might need it in less than two years. That's about how long it takes for the market to rebound during a recession. (If you have college coming up, and budget 30k$/year, then make sure that 30k-60k (depending on how much you expect to earn for those two years) is within reach. Once that's done, any excess funds you can do whatever with.
