This, thinking about this I keep going to trying to motivate myself to be better or maybe develop more self esteem earlier. But I know it wouldn't matter, 13 year old me gave fuck all about anything. 

I dunno, maybe I could get myself to be more active, like take 13 year old me mountain biking."

todayilearned,ff2cjwi,t1_fezjet5,1579500737.0,"Sometimes, it depended what studio. Like around Oscar season this was always an issue because we would often only have a few copies of the Oscar nominated movies but people would really want them after hear about them that way. Or like cult indie movies with strong word of mouth, often only having like one copy. There would also be times when it was a big movie but the studios wouldn't want to support rentals so we'd get nowhere near the demand."

todayilearned,feytku7,t1_fex6r2f,1579450326.0,Why are late fees BS? Customers are often waiting for a movie to be returned but most people don't bring shit back out of pure laziness. Without a consequence for not returning a product good luck ever getting a popular new release.
todayilearned,feyss4u,t1_fexdql7,1579450163.0,Late fees existed for a purpose even outside of profit motives. If you have a new movie that's hard to get or maybe the one copy of a smaller or older movie there is a good chance people are waiting for it. People come to to store looking for a specific movie and can't get it because your lazy ass won't take it back even though you watch it the first night and it's been sitting on your coffee table for 3 days.
