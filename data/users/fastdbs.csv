The mechanical portion is a static ratio planetary gearset. It uses the electric motors to control the torque and RPMs of the gas motor, not changes in gearing. You can't use the eCVT system in anything but a hybrid.

AskEngineers,fcjl028,t3_ehiklz,1577691920.0,"During internal combustion your source and sink is the air. So the difference in temp of the air before, during and after combustion define efficiency. E.g. The more energy extracted into expansion vs heat loss and blowing out hot air increases efficiency. This is why turbos help engine efficiency. They extract the heat energy from the exhaust and use it to allow denser combustion. 

Radiators decrease efficiency but keep the engine from overheating and having predetonation (knock). This is why some cars have louvers that close over the radiator in cold climates. You also see it on semis when they cover their front grill with fabric blocking."

So ICBM carries at maybe Mach 4 average for most of the flight. Last few hundred or thousand miles warhead is launched and then attains high speeds. The system would still take over 2 hours to reach New York from Russia. This is less of a threat than a close range launch from a submarine.

1) settling
2) temp coefficient differences. 
3) operational stresses
4) tolerance stack up
5) wear

AskEngineers,fc1pz1w,t3_efn0xe,1577326043.0,"This is more complicated than that. 

1) It looks like the hinge supports one side of the foldong deck so it takes both passive and dynamic loading. People are a much more difficult load case than structure. That why there are so many tragedies involving deck failures. 

2) Nothing is actually straight and then it changes some more over time. Especially true over long distances. Hinges hate not being aligned. This adds a bunch of loads. 

3) At that distance thermal and moisture expansion is a substantial concern with wood. You'll need to have expansion joints to prevent side loading the hinges. This isn't usually an issue for solid decks. 

4) At that length even large joists will be flexing under load and as the floor moves. This will put both shear and moment loads on the hinges. 

If you are starting to think ""this is why Ive never seen this done IRL"" then bingo. You get it. 

The last point is permits. You need to be able to get permits for this. That will require an engineer to get involved for any deck that doesn't meet an approved ""design sheet"" from your local government."
