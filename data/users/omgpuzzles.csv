nasa,ffroymc,t3_euv7hb,1580162606.0,"This is the trailer for Season 4 of NASA Explorers. My teammate (and good friend) and I have been working on this for almost two years, and other teammates have joined in as we've brought this video series to life in the last seven months or so. The first full episode will go live on Wednesday 1/29, and will release weekly on Wednesdays for eight weeks after that. I've talked with the mods, and they have blessed me sharing them here. This has been one of the biggest projects we've worked on, and it covers subjects near and dear to my science and space-loving nerd heart. I'm reaching through the wormhole to high-five 12-year-old me at Space Camp in 1987. I hope y'all enjoy following along! :) Thanks for letting me share!
