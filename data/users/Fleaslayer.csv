That being said, this doesn't necessarily have to be a write off. Your girlfriend sounds a bit manipulative, and she's successfully pushing your buttons. When she says something like that she doesn't want to be with you, she gets a reaction from you.  Getting loud does, too. You've said that you go into the mode of trying to smooth things over and make peace, but what that means is that you're moving more her direction, giving in more to what she wants, and not thinking as much about what you want and need. Think of it like a kid throwing a tantrum because he wants a cookie. But giving in an giving him the cookie isn't necessarily the best thing to do.

That behaviour is clearly working for her, and so she'll keep it up or escalate it.  Clearly that's not going to be a fair or satisfying relationship for you if she does. So if you want to try and make it work, you can't let that behaviour manipulate you. 

There are probably multiple ways you could handle it. You could try just not being manipulated or letting her push your buttons and see if she stops doing it. Better might be to talk to her about it; tell her that the way she's handling conflict is bothering you and you can't live with it. 

She might not change, and you might have to decide if you're going to continue to put up with it or move on. But maybe she'll want to work on it with you.

explainlikeimfive,fc8kb6h,t3_egppmj,1577536703.0,"For a little kid, I think I'd explain that there are all kinds of living things in the world. Some of them, like whales and elephants, are really big, and some, like ants, are really small, but there are things that are much, much smaller than ants - so small you can't even see them. 

Most of these little things don't hurt you. In fact, lots of them are really helpful, but there are some that will make you sick if you get them in your mouth. We call those things germs. Since you can't really see them, the best thing to do is wash your hands before eating, or anytime after handling things that are dirty,  where the germs might live."
TwoXChromosomes,fc8j08m,t3_egpk1f,1577535949.0,"I agree with others that you should report it right away, even if the chance of finding something is remote. You'll always regret it if you don't. I also suggest making an appointment with your GP to let them know that happened and to see if they want to check anything else. The ER doctors are all about your immediate health; just because they discharged you doesn't been you shouldn't still see a regular doctor."
AskMen,fc8ii2g,t1_fc8a46k,1577535628.0,"I agree with the premise, but not the solution. Yes, it's true, no matter what you do, some guys (and a few girls) will interpret compliments as romantic interest. And while you certainly *could* address it by not giving any compliments anymore, that's a crappy way to live, and you'll find that it has a negative affect on your outlook on life. Better is to just be aware and accept that some people will misinterpret it, and be ready to address it if necessary.

It's worth noting that pretty much every woman with a customer service job, especially those that rely on tips (like waitresses), has to deal with this. Their job includes being nice to people, and lots of lonely or horny guys get the wrong idea.

You just have to be ready to let them know you're not interested in them romantically if needed. There's no shame in that.

By the way, your English seems great (that's a compliment, but I'm not interested)."
grilling,fc7n4c8,t1_fc7hqqr,1577512966.0,"When you pull a hunk of meat off the grill (or smoker or oven) and let it rest, the internal temperature doesn't immediately start going down, it actually keeps going up for a bit. How much depends mostly on the thickness and density of the meat. So the commenter is saying to pull it off when it's around ten degrees lower than your desired serving temperature (I would have guessed more like 5 in this case)."

When I first started in software engineering in the 80s, people imagined how cool it would be if we could make an AI that could read text on a printed piece of paper out loud. Now that's so commonplace that we don't consider it AI. That's actually a real problem with AI discussions: the definition is evolving rapidly.

There are lots of articles on the different approaches or types. [Here's one](https://www.zeolearn.com/magazine/understanding-different-types-of-artificial-intelligence-technology) that's fairly top level. AIs like Deep Blue have little in common with the one in the OP.

Using NNs and pattern matching is just one approach to AI, it's not the definition of it.

technology,fc6b84y,t1_fc5ryq1,1577476526.0,"I'm no expert, but my guess would be the problem would be creating the data. Just data on stock performance itself wouldn't be very useful because they're driven by other factors. What factors? What people are buying, company mergers and acquisitions, competing solutions to similar problems, government contracts, fads, executive turnover, and on and on. How would you even begin to capture and code all the things that drive the market in a way that a computer could process it, and how could you stay on top of that data?"

On the other hand, most of us aren't awfully complicated and appreciate straightforward communication. Someone else suggested dropping hints, but that's usually doomed to failure. It's much better to be direct without being hurtful. You could say something like, ""I really like hanging out with you. It's always so frustrating when guys think I'm hitting on them when I just like their friendship. You seem cool with just being friends, and I appreciate that."""
