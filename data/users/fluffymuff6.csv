CPTSD,ffgkoeu,t3_ethjf7,1579908443.0,"It's very traumatizing to experience abuse as a child, and for many years. It will take time for you to heal. Find a person with whom you feel safe and share your story. Make sure they're OK hearing it. The more you tell your story, the less power it has over you. If you have trouble telling your story to anyone, try writing about it. Seeing it on the page will make it feel different. Yes, these things are difficult--that's why it's good to have that safe person to soothe you & encourage you. But telling your story over & over will help release the grip it has on you. Best of luck."
