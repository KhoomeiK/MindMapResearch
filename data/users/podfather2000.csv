He fought Al Iaquinta for the title who was basically a real-estate salesman at that point. And Felder would have been a harder matchup. Yea its Khabibs own fault he fights every Star Wars movie realize. You are acting as if he fought like 5 times a year before he got a title shot. He only beat journeymen on his way to the title. And is known for not making weight. So, of course, they cant market him like a big star. He doesn't even want that. He will definitely fight Conor he hates the guy and they will pay him a tone of money. Probably never fights again after that."

So you're basing your claim of a example you dont even fully remember. Sounds totally logical. How is your case even affirmative action?

Affirmative action is a policy used by colleges and universities to improve the educational opportunities of minority groups (including minority races, genders, and sexual orientations) that where historically discriminate against. It's not based solely in race.

UpliftingNews,ff8yafu,t1_ff8wqwq,1579699954.0,The problem there would be they are next to state with low or no gun regulations so they just carry guns into the state. Any solution would have to be nationwide to have any effect. I know that is why Detroit has a lot of guns. But that's the issue in most big cities here in Europe too. There is lots of violence where the poorest of the city live.  I don't know if any major city that has low levels of violence compared to small cities.

UpliftingNews,ff8wgor,t1_ff8vobr,1579698361.0,">I tend to think a middle ground is that handguns specifically for open or closed carry should be registered whereas semi-auto rifles and shotguns (of a certain barrel length) should not. 

Yea rifles and semi auto machine guns dont really have a large impact. Percentage wise anyway.We just here about them a lot because mass shooters use them a lot. I don't think the problem can be solved without some kind of nationwide registry. If it's just state by state it basically useless. Maybe you could make laws that only in certain cases the registry would be available to the police or something in that direction. 

>Like you said most gun deaths are from gang related handgun shootings, and a large chunk of that is from illegal guns that wouldnt be registered anyhow.

I could be wrong on this but i think they obtain a lot of guns true second-hand purchases. So a person just legally buys a gun and just sells it on. I think that's probably easier then obtaining guns totally illegally. Unless its like a high crime organization and they buy guns in bulk from the Philippines. Guns that are hot normally end up moving south of the border."

UpliftingNews,ff8oklf,t1_ff8nvu8,1579689061.0,"Honestly, I would recommend looking at the Swiss model and adapting it to the USA. Im sure not all of it can be copied but a few things could. Like adding gun safety and handling classes to people who are newly purchasing guns. How ammunition should be handled. Adding a federal register of gun owners, probably just a paper one since people in the US have this fundamental mistrust of the government and how it would handle such information. Cracking down on gang violence would also have to be discussed since i think that is the primary source of gun violence. This would probably mean upping the community outreach and making people feel safe so they dont run to gangs for safety and presenting alternatives to the gang life. Implementing laws that prevent second-hand purchases of guns. So for instance, if you buy a new gun it's registered to your name and if you wish to sell it you have to register it to the buyer. All of this could significantly reduce gun deaths in the US. But i don't think there is much political will to do it. At least i dont see any politician advocate for a complex multi-level approach."
