AppleWatch,ff4hjt8,t1_ff34ykj,1579563771.0,I honestly don’t see the issue with subscription models. If you don’t want to pay a monthly fee just don’t use the app. I also wouldn’t pay $5/month for pillow but I’m probably not the apps target group. I think it’s perfectly fine for a developer to decide how “exclusive” the app should be.
Futurology,fexytoi,t1_feww2fc,1579438477.0,"Having lived in multiple EU counties and the US, I can ensure you that German Internet really isn’t that bad. Compared to the US it’s very affordable and most importantly unlimited. Yes, I’m sure that there are local issues and limited availability in rural areas but that’s not unique to Germany. In my first flat near Wimbledon, London, I could only get <5Mb/s even through it was a fairly modern area.

That said, I agree that there is still a lot of room for improvement. However, having better broadband won’t solve one of the core issues that there is not much VC capital available in Germany."

ShittyLifeProTips,fdabfig,t1_fda7yqo,1578244111.0,Just tell them that you have done your time and don’t want to scare them. Then ensure them that they wouldn’t be in danger anyways because they’re not your type for that sort of thing.

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fc4zukh,t1_fc4sm56,1577435864.0,"I get why kids might want to own AirPods but I also understand that parents don’t want their children to show off luxury items. In my experience, kids whose parents buy them expensive iPhones, LV bags, and Gucci cloths are just an absolute nightmare to deal with."
