juul,ffciurc,t1_ffc9swk,1579800399.0,I believe that all this shit was supported by cigarettes companies. I used to smoke cigarettes and I tried tobacco flavor.. cigarettes is way better. But I’ll never get back to smoking cigarettes I’ll find a better way
technews,ffc6em6,t1_ffc5y3c,1579792608.0,"The original Syrian tabouleh with only lettuce, parsley, cucumber, tomato, bulgur and some lemon is pretty good. 
If you add anything it’ll be disgusting. I tried it in Egypt 6 years ago and it wasn’t delicious at all, not even the Lebanese tabouleh, only the Syrian one is good"
