BlueJackets,fefblax,t1_fefbdjm,1579052732.0,"Idk about better, but he's definitely playing well. I just feel more comfortable with Korpi in net. Merzy has a habit of overcommitting and has some weird positional quirks. He also struggles a bit with rebound control. Either way, damn good problem to have."
BlueJackets,fefbdq2,t1_fefb8f0,1579052595.0,"Oh I'm with you. And I even said I'd have understood a penalty. But so many B's fans kept insisting that it was intentional and that Bemmer was a dirty player. Which is insane. You can say it was a penalty, but there's no way in hell it was intentional"
BlueJackets,fefavwu,t1_fefaubn,1579052270.0,Valid point

Oh and PLD got three assists tonight. He's at 33 points in 44 games played and is just a goddamn bull moose. I love him. If he keeps that up, he's a 60+ point guy and his ceiling is even higher"

BlueJackets,fc7a5ux,t1_fc79wii,1577501599.0,"Lol keep dreaming bud. We will absolutely win one in my lifetime and then all that shit talk you have will be for naught because you'll be on the same level as a team that you continuously hate on. As much as I hate the Pens and their fans, at least they've fucking won a few. Y'all win one in your entire history and you act like the greatest team in history. You'll never be out of the shadow of more successful teams and I'm so glad that you get to flounder in mediocrity forever."
