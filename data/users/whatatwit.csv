>Ambergris takes many forms, but is most often an egg-shaped or round lump which can weigh many kilograms: the largest-recorded ambergris ‘boulder’ to date was retrieved off Australia in 1913 and weighed 455 kgs!  By contrast, the lump found recently on Anglesey weighs just over a kilogram. Its colour varies from black, to shades of brown, gold-brown and even grey and tends to lighten over time. Similarly, the smell of a lump of ambergris is more pungent when newly-excreted and again, tends to mellow over time. It has an odour variously described as reminiscent of farmyard manure or the smell of seaweed – certainly many people find it objectionable, yet others claim it’s quite pleasant!

When she was studying botany A level at evening classes, her teacher encouraged her to apply for university as a mature student. (She would never have considered it otherwise). And so began her career as a palyonologist (studying pollen). She worked for many years reconstructing ancient environments on archaeological sites. But a phone call from a police detective led to a dramatic change of direction, when she was in her fifties. Since then, Pat has been involved in some of the most high-profile murder cases in Britain. The evidence she gave at the Old Bailey helped to convict Ian Huntley, the school caretaker who murdered two ten year old girls in Soham in Cambridgeshire in 2002. She provided evidence for the Milly Dowler murder case in 2003 and the murder of the Ipswich prostitutes in 2006. She tells Jim Al-Khalili about her life scientific and how by studying pollen spores taken from suspects and their possessions, she can establish who’s been where.
