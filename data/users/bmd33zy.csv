She broke your trust and a lot of times also a part of you deep inside that will never be the same again. If you‚Äôre done with her, be done with her. Block her, dont see her, and dont give her anything. She made her choice. 

Just for moving ons sake, guy or girl, never do this to anyone, break up if you feel like you have to sleep with someone else."
