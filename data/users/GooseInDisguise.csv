Instagramreality,ff31suq,t1_ff2ef6n,1579531429.0,"I agree. We were mocking Instagram ""models"" on the beach a few months ago, because they'd each spend at least a half hour trying to get the right picture/pose. They'd pose, look at the picture, scold their friend/boyfriend, repose, look again, adjust, maybe scold, repeat. It was ridiculous.

But from the start this girl isn't doing the same thing. She's being filmed, to me it was obvious she was trying to do more than just get the perfect Instagram pose."

AskReddit,fenfrvp,t3_eq1wzh,1579283742.0,"It's -17 outside according to my thermometer. I just came in from spending the morning outdoors, all alone (it was -26 when I started). I snowshoed with my dog. I split a big box of kindling. I cleared all the snow. I brought in firewood. I stocked up the bird feeders.

Now I've got a hot cup of coffee, I'm curled up with warm slippers and a quilt my grandma made me decades ago, in a cozy rocking chair beside the fire. The dog is stretched out on the hearth pad. The cat is purring on my lap. The kids are at school so the house is quiet, and clean.

Right now, I am completely happy."

I'm thinking I need to use my next set of days off to join some protests. Fuck Ford. Fuck Lecce. Fuck this government. Fuck cuts to front line workers in education and healthcare. While part of me wants the teachers demands to be met asap, part of me wants it to drag on because it's keeping the government's attention on education and off healthcare a bit - my job will be potentially on the line when they start fucking with healthcare."
ontario,femwqw6,t1_femucvc,1579271620.0,"A good salary entices the best and brightest into the profession. I'd rather pay our teachers more so that our kids have a better education than paying them too little so the best and brightest burn out and move on.

Yes, there are some teachers who chose the career because it was easy, but most are in it because it's a passion."

I find gravenhurst and bracebridge to be far too busy in the summer, and the entire region gets swarmed with leaf peepers for a few weeks in the fall"
ontario,fek24bq,t3_epkv61,1579190981.0,"Start by looking for employment. Where could you find a job in your field?

How much do you like winter and winter activities? Have you ever lived in a smaller community? It takes some people a time to adjust to not having the conveniences of a city. I think that of the places you've listed, the further north you go the more important outdoor recreation should be to you. Huntsville/Bracebridge and North Bay are amazing places but a lot of what to do for fun involves being outside (and as a person/family who loves the outdoors we are so happy living here near-ish to Huntsville)."
ontario,fek1clv,t1_fejzp1w,1579190505.0,"It's a budget airline. I've flown with them for 5 or 6 trips now, and I'm continually shocked at passengers who expect first class service from their $50 ticket. The planes are old. They're not comfortable. They're operating on a razor thin margin and don't have spare planes so cancellations like this can happen. There are no free snacks, bring your own and pack a water bottle.

If planes were stores, swoop would be wal mart. Adjust your expectations and plans accordingly. If you want better service, including having available planes and such, spring for the more expensive AC or WJ ticket.

But I love their seat sales, and I am happy to fly with them from Hamilton or London to get home to Edmonton for a cheap visit. And I LOVE that they charge for carry on bags, because everyone boards and sits down, instead of taking an hour to fuss with the overhead bins."
ontario,fek0l67,t1_feiwau9,1579190037.0,"I've flown with them a lot, and will continue to do so. If I wait and book at seat sales it's a great way to fly home to Edmonton with my kids to see family. I booked flights on Tuesday and got seats in the $50 range each way. 

But I'm also pretty realistic about it and wouldn't feel comfortable leaving the country with them. If we get stranded in Edmonton, I can just stay with my family for longer and book flights back with AC, WJ or even Flair. It would be different if I had to pay for hotels for any delay."

politics,fe7wjor,t1_fe6r5uz,1578919973.0,"Adoption would ruin me. I consider myself to have good mental health and a lot of resiliency, but there is no way I could hand over a baby I spent the bulk of a year growing. I felt that intense hormone induced rush of fierce love the instant my babies were born (not every mother does and that's okay). Having a baby and giving him or her away would break me. There's just no way I could do it.

I think people who casually suggest adoption instead of abortion are cruel."

The whole, ""I want my sons penis to look like mine"" just seems so odd. Little kid bodies look nothing like adult bodies. Even if a boy was circumcised, he won't look like his dad."

fatlogic,fdkanz8,t1_fdjvssv,1578499851.0," Didn't worry about my weight until I switched careers. When I did field work, I was out and active all day, almost every day and my days off at home were spent hiking or skiing. Of course I could eat what I wanted, I burned it off.

But a switch in lifestyle meant I had to change things in a hurry. Now I need about 1800 cal a day, and I'm currently eating 1200-1500/day to trim down tad."

canada,fdgq19w,t1_fdgjur9,1578405301.0,"I bought mine in 2006, I think. It was a sizeable chunk of my paycheque but I was working in the Arctic and tired of freezing my ass off. I bought it in Yellowknife so I'm sure it wasn't the cheapest either. It kept me warm for years. I don't take it out unless it's below minus 20 either, because it's so warm. 

Last winter I noticed the cuffs were fraying but and the zipper was on the verge of breaking. I contacted Canada Goose and they allowed me to mail it to them and they did the repairs for free. I just paid shipping. Sure, I could have fixed it, but I was impressed with their customer support.

I'm surprised they're trendy now, but it's something that was definitely worth the hefty price tag."

Question for anyone who can help. Does a website debunking haes and fatlogic in simple terms exist? I refer a lot of people to skepticalraptor for evidence based vaccine questions, but is there a similar resource for health and nutrition? I don't have the ambition to make one, but I'd love a resource to send people instead of being based for pointing out that fatlogic is the equivalent of anti vaxxers logic but with nutrition in mind."

politics,fcys6z1,t1_fcyl4ur,1578085944.0,"I wouldn't classify meatloaf as amazing, but I'd say mine is pretty damn good. For starters don't use shitty ground beef, splurge for the good stuff. Season it just right but don't overhandle it or it'll get tough. Things like breadcrumbs or shredded potato were historically added to be filler, so a damn delicious meatloaf doesn't rely on those. However since I'm usually cheap and have kids to feed I like to saute carrots, onion, celery and garlic and add that in. I slice onions thick and put the loaf on top of that so the grease drains off but it gets more flavour. And then a thick glaze with brown sugar, Worcestershire (thank you autocorrect) sauce, a bit of cider vinegar and some tomato paste and more spice and stick it in the oven with a meat probe, and don't over cook."
ontario,fcyqoih,t1_fcyf70o,1578085102.0,">Seems like taxpayers are just going to be indirectly funding businesses

This is my concern. We already have wages not keeping up with inflation. Will we see more employers take a wal mart like approach and severely under pay and under schedule employees? Are we going to see more people working sporadic part time min wage jobs?

I absolutely support helping lift people out of poverty. Nobody deserves to be unable to live on what they earn. But I just see a program like this, if implemented provincially, working at first and then turning into a program where the government funds people to work for big companies, and that's not right."
