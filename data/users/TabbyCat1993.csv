stevenuniverse,ff3ubmu,t3_equlea,1579549019.0,"Was going to make a new thread about this, but I think this is a good spot to talk about this....

Who here has predictions about how Steven Universe Future is going to go?

The first series was basically about Steven coming into his role as a Crystal Gem and himself as a half-gem.  We all learned his mother was a war hero and beloved by the other Crystal Gems.  But as time goes on, we learn more about Rose Quartz and that she didn’t quite deserve that pedestal the others put her on, so now Steve has to deal with who his mother really was and what she did...

Steven wants to move past his mother but as he grows up, he feels he’s becoming more like her (what with randomly turning pink and losing control of his emotions)

By the end of the series, Steve will come to terms with his mother, and realize while she’s far from perfect, there were a lot of good things about her too and she’s done so much for others.  He’ll even put her picture back up in the living room!

And who’s going to be the one to snap him out of his depression groove?

Jasper.

I’m betting they’ll forge a subtle bond and help each other through their personal crisis’.   Jasper will not want to openly admit that Steven has become her friend and would rather remain a “lone wolf type” but she will secretly enjoy Steven’s visits.  And over time, she will become more outgoing, but still aloof....

What do you think?"
