Every person is different, just hold on for a bit longer and your results might become positive again.
In the meantime, you can try some little things to give an extra edge; regularly change your bedsheets, drink lots of dairy, avoid diary, try getting some zinc and probiotics in your diet.

I have tried doxycycline and minocycline myself in the past, I'm afraid they didn't help in my case. Currently my Accutane treatment is showing good progress, though I had some nasty purging at first."
