BUT, the parrot would imitate everyone's car pulling into the driveway and door knocks if they came to my parents house often enough. The parrot loved my dads brother and kept making his car and knock noises after he died. He would ask for stuff by saying ""Where?"" and then pointing at stuff or saying something. My mom said he would say ""where?"" and then do my uncles knock. Apparently it really messed with my dad."

Now everyone thinks I used to do a ton of hard drugs and I never did. At least most people in my boat got to enjoy hard drugs for a while haha. The stigma around teeth really sucks, its not always the persons fault when they're messed up. Mine were messed up before I was old enough to even know it was happening. Now imagine how I feel reading all these comments about how ""disgusting and terrible"" that person is.
