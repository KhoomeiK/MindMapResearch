I understand the impulse, but I don't want to support it.  And I've found some lovely and helpful subs.

If you want to criticize Boomers, there are so many things to choose from, including the abandoned ideals, the self-centeredness, the conversion from citizens to consumers, and so on. The warning stickers were a project of Jill Biden and were widely reviled by the Boomer generation, who were actually  the ones making and buying the albums the puritans were trying to control.  Also DARE was a project of Nancy Reagan, who was pre-boomer, and was considered a useless waste of money by us Boomers.  Because people were trying to be small minded and control what was happening doesn't mean ignoring the amazing flourishing of the music and drug cultures of the 60s and 70s, which, you know, there are the albums, the artwork, the films, the biographies.  Made by Boomers.  Bought by Boomers.  And the moral panic about the Satanic stuff was one of a series of moral panics dating back through history, and certainly not a feature of the whole Boomer culture."
