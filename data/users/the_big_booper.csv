I'm about to start my MD after finishing my PhD, and I have hoped that these human touches are worth fighting for. I hope that we keep the encroachment of technology at the expense of humanity at bay, but, alas, you may be correct."

todayilearned,ff2kp8m,t1_ff2f5xs,1579510614.0,"People who suggest that physicians can be easily replaced with AI severely underestimate what physicians do.

In addition to diagnoses, which AI could help with, physicians routinely must make difficult ethical decisions and are responsible for the social work that accompanies the delivery of care. It is unlikely that 1) AI could do that and 2) people would want AI to do that even if it could."

todayilearned,fed42cx,t1_fecfpo5,1578997788.0,"Alright, I think you're picking this fight with the wrong person because I don't disagree that in most common usage ""black"" makes most sense, which I said in my first reply to you. I responded to your original comment because you said that the use of African-American (among other terms) prevents the integration of American minorities. While I have some complicated feelings about my own hyphenation as an Indian-American, I was merely pointing out that African-American is useful in an anthropological context. If you're studying the history of a people and the development of culture, then having a term to describe this diaspora is useful. Like, if you want to know the origins of rock and roll, blues, or gospel it is this diaspora one should look to. And having a name for that diaspora is useful in service of that study.

As far as the other hyphenations, I can only speak to my own case. I used to hate it for precisely the reason you mentioned: prevention of integration. But I now disagree. Dropping the Indian from my Indian-American heritage suggests that integration demands giving something up. I gave up a lot in my younger years to ""become"" American (although legally I always was). I gave up the ability to speak my parents' language, for example. All in service of being more American than Indian. To me, being an American is a political identity, a belief in the American republic. The culture is ever-shifting, and I don't want my contribution to that culture from my own Indianness to be erased in service of ""integration,"" because to me that's not what integration looks like. Integration is recognizing that we may all come from different places, but that all of us are also Americans. Our strength is in the recognition and acceptance of our diversity as a people."

todayilearned,fe7syhi,t1_fe784w9,1578918925.0,They aren't African-American then. I'm not saying all black people are African-American. I'm saying there's a reason for the term itself to exist.

todayilearned,fe5dfi6,t1_fe0yunv,1578868059.0,"While I agree black is more appropriate in common parlance, there's a good reason for it to exist. African-American refers to the diaspora of people descended from slaves in the United States. It's a useful term in an anthropological context."
todayilearned,fe55l1a,t1_fe1gmew,1578865836.0,Are Cambridge commutes really that bad on average? Mine is like 15 minutes max and I have to go through city centre. I guess a bike makes things a bit easier.

todayilearned,fdlnc2o,t1_fdl2qke,1578527928.0,"As a scientist (not in forensics), I think it's pretty clear what does and does not count as being scientific. Is there a falsifiable hypothesis? Are the methods you're using rigorously tested? Have you verified this method with a blinded or double-blinded study? Are the results you're getting reproducible? As I understand it, a lot of ballistic forensics does not pass muster when you ask these questions."
