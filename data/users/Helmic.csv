Pathfinder2e,ffb3m43,t3_escrb5,1579750925.0,"Is heavy armor from Champion really that good?  The loss of mobility for +1 AC seems steep, especially if you have to further invest in STR.  It seems to struggle with just taking the Armor Proficiency general feat and using your DEX to achieve a similar AC, at least until level 11-ish or so.  And at that point you'd have to take a second Champion feat just to bump your armor up to Expert, while your unarmored proficiency will be scaling automatically and benefiting from DEX.  It's a lot of investment to *only* get one point of AC at great expense, you'd really have to want to play a STR sorceror (at which point it seems almost like a mandatory pick).  Meanwhile Monk has some stances that can give you AC, and both Fighter and Monk seem to have more overall support for DEX fighting."

Pathfinder2e,ff7fb4l,t1_ff6zv9a,1579648225.0,"In more general terms, 5e is more rules light, which plays really well with the GM just improvising everything. This works very well for experienced GM's who often feel their expertise confined by the rules, but it can leave people who aren't as talented feeling lost.

PF2 is far more structured and gives more guidelines on what to do when a player wants to do something unexpected. The action system better accommodates more complex interactions and there are often rules that give consistent and fair results.

That said, for me the draw is the combat. All three systems can more or less handle non-combat, with 5e and PF2 doing way better because of spell and spell slot rebalancing to reduce the ability to just fix everything with magic, but the real reason to use a D&D style system over something like Dungeon World is the combat. Even if it takes more reading up to run, it's more fun to win a tactical wargame than to roll a single die and just stylize how you won that die roll."
Pathfinder2e,ff7ecv2,t1_ff63byp,1579647599.0,"A game can't both lack bad builds and have a ""high skill ceiling"" in regards to chargen. Efficacy is relative, if you make a top tier cheese build you either do or do not utterly outclass a non-sandbagging build. They can't coexist because if skilled players build characters that outclass others then adventures will become either trivial or utterly ignore what other players are doing.

Furthermore, skill in character building is more analogous to deck building in CCG's - it's just netdecking. Any ""skill"" in the sense of increased efficacy comes from meta concepts to predict what the GM will be running and creating a ""counter"" and aside from being undesirable behavior to encourage on a systemic level (you're not a bad person for enjoying it but it's bad for the game to reward that behavior) PF2 doesn't offer too much to do this sort of meta cheese, not even with rangers.

PF2, from what I've seen, has a very minimal gap in build efficacy assuming no sandbagging. There is still cheese but it can't really do what cheese did in PF1, as the game simply lacks the ability to fuck with numbers the same way. Feat buckets and a lack of feat chains prevent overspecialization.

This is good, as like 5e most of the skill comes during actual play, except with a much higher gap between poor, average, and good play.  The crit and action system require actual tactics from everyone, with even (and especially) Fighters needing to think carefully about their moves. Positioning is critical, and using a variety of actions from feats is necessary to win. There isn't likely to be much success if the party just full attacks like in PF1 or 5e.

This still does leave room for players who aren't as excited or engaged with the wargamey combat to be outclassed, but it's far more easily addressed by experienced players sharing their plans (""I need help flanking this enemy!"") and someone can improve over the course of an adventure. Feats RAW can be swapped out over the course of a week and don't require GP unless the GM decides to be a dick about it, so even more extensive respecs are possible to allow players to just pick what looks fun now and worry about a build later.

This is why many PF1 players who really enjoyed just building characters aren't enjoying PF2 as much, as PF2 has fewer toys and isn't as breakable. While that's a valid way to enjoy the game, I think making the game enjoyable during actual sessions was the right call."

Warframe,ff4sjd4,t1_ff4i6gi,1579571406.0,"The way points work is that once you're carrying more than 15 then the bonus points you get from turning them in actually goes proportionately down. So you want to turn points in in batches of 15.

But carrying points lowers your health considerably and gradually drains your energy every second, at 15 points most frames die to a single bullet and their energy drains too fast to use their abilities.

Enter Rhino. He has an ability to gain an absurd amount of armor and a buff to his damage (as well as to any teammates he manages to catch in his AoE), and that armor isn't reduced by holding points. So he's one of a few frames that are ideal as point runners, picking up all the points and turning them in so the rest of the team can kill enemies without having their own HP and energy drained.

While the meme implies Rhino players don't know what they're doing, it's actually a fairly standard setup and what most people should be doing (though there are a few other builds that can also carry points).

But everyone forgets about the time from time to time and when the point carrier forgets it everyone loses."

Warframe,ff4qvd7,t1_ff4p75q,1579570261.0,"Depends. You definitely shouldn't be dying that quickly in a proper carrier frame like Rhino, and if there is a tanky frame it is much faster to let them pick up the points and get that larger bonus so everyone can get out of there faster.  Even if you *do* die, you only drop your points so the carrier can grab them, *and* you drop an extra point.  If you're running a low level or inappropriate frame for Index and can't contribute much else, being a point bag and just deliberately allowing yourself to die to enemies near the goal will net a good few points that the carrier can pick up.

And regardless, suicide is painless. It's just a handy way to make your points available for a bigger bonus without turning them in yourself.

If you're going for a John Prodman run, then it makes more sense fit everyone to turn in at low values as enemies get much nastier. The time bonus does not factor in bonus points."
Anarchy101,ff41l75,t1_ff3gfqc,1579553552.0,"That angle is more reasonable, but it's usually not what I see on Reddit.  There is a serious opportunity cost to, say, canvass for a candidate versus occasionally showing vocal support, that's actual time off work you're not spending on other projects. But even then what praxis is available to someone is going to vary from person to person. Most people aren't cut out for black bloc shit, not everyone will survive jail time, not everyone lives in an area where there's a significant leftist presence. If someone is going to berate someone else for volunteering to help a politician's campaign, there needs to be clear and concrete alternative given that's visibly better, actually an option for that individual, uses similar skillsets, similar level of risk and commitment, et cetera. And I just don't think people are going to be able to provide that strictly superior option for praxis, and that's why there's always talk about plurality of tactics."
Pathfinder2e,ff3grsh,t1_ff33dmq,1579540708.0,"Yeah, it is something that would allow you to prepare just line spells for your damage and still have the flexibility to adjust them as the situation calls for it. It's effectively increasing the number of ""perfect"" spells you're able to cast per day where the spell is just exactly what was tactically needed. And, more importantly, it allows more to be done with a limited number of spells known.

It's strong, but maybe not too strong to be in the game at all. Sure, if you have the feat then you're going to pick fewer damage spells, but you have to still pick the feat and I think that's a tall ask if it's competing against other really good feats."
Anarchy101,ff3dt8d,t1_ff2syf4,1579539081.0,"It's a bit contentious. I don't think many expect voting to be truly revolutionary, but the harm reduction angle is pretty compelling to at least myself as I would rather not die for lack of healthcare.

I've seen arguments about voting not helping everyone, such as migrant workers still being screwed over no matter what, but I think the onus is on those who advocate for not voting to explain how that particular action *will* improve everyone's welfare across the board.

There's also the opportunity cost argument, but given how easy voting is for many anarchists I'd argue it's a responsibility to use your privilege and waste what may be just a couple hours of your time for a fairly outsized impact, it's not such an onerous time commitment that you will not be able to do any praxis all year because of it.

And then we go into the ableism that tends to leak into some anti-voting narratives, where anything that can be done online isn't seen as valid.

Where it becomes far more insidious is when New Atheist types go after, say, Islam and present it as this backwards religion in order to help justify the oppression of Muslims both domestically and overseas through imperialism. There's certainly legitimate criticisms to be had, but shit like ""it oppresses women"" ignores predominantly Christian nations doing the same or worse and how much of the geopolitics of the Middle East are a direct result of Western imperialism. Lefty Muslims just don't exist in this framework, and what Muslims have to say gets ignored.

Whether I see a doctor, eat, or die are all up to the whims of politicians, who pass laws that are enforced through violence to regulate those things. The state uses its self-declared monopoly on the justified use of violence to prevent me from, say, going into an empty house and just living there.

It is the abuse of the concept of ""apolitical"" ideas that causes much suffering. Colloquially, we use politics to simply mean ""anything that causes a ruckus when it comes up"" so we end up with nonsense like racist jokes being considered apolitical (because the targets of the abuse aren't numerous, organized, or cared about enough for there to be a real ruckus) while antiracism is political (because those who argue back are perceived to be the source of the ruckus).

So this elevation of being ""apolitical"" ends up being used to harm others, to enforce silence when there is suffering. And so I have to question the faith of those who *can* be political and do something to help others but choose not to in order to not be perceived as rocking the boat. It is not Christlike, and so it's a stretch to call such a person a Christian.

There is nuance, of course. Not everyone can take obvious political action, whether that be due to disability, precarious living situations, violence from the state, and so on. But well wishes don't help people materially and God calls upon us to help people.

Whether you wish to identify openly as a socialist is up to you. In many contexts not having the label is tactically useful. But the ideas of universal human emancipation, of meeting everyone's material needs, must still apply or you're fundamentally a hypocrite.

That's why your insistence on avoiding political labels is being treated with suspicion. Jesus is an *extremely* political figure and was executed for extremely political reasons as he undermined the authority of those in power, so condemning the use of ""political agendas"" without examining the actual politics of those agendas is to contradict Jesus."
Pathfinder_RPG,fewj05g,t1_feweyty,1579411517.0,"Because much of the actual cleverness comes outside of battle, both in the fiction (BBEG spying) and within the context of character build planning. That's a sort of fun, but the actual dice rolling tactical wargame bit has always struggled to be interesting in PF1. 5e's more liberal movement rules make that game actually fairly fun even if you're using pregens, and PF2's reinvented action economy and mobility (along with spells being overall nerfed but almost always having some impact due to the four degrees of success) make that game actually pretty fun as a tactical minis game. You can do all this planning stuff in those systems as well, but there isn't that same potential to reduce combat to a singular meaningful choice (ie not counting decisions to full attack as a martial without moving).

That's not to say that style of combat is wrongfun, I just now strongly prefer PF2's combat and find even routine skirmishes more engaging than these mythical good high level caster fights in PF1 that take a lot more effort and ingenuity out of the GM. That and being able to play martials with actual tactical options is really fun and mixes things up a lot more than the assumption that only the casters' choices in high level combat tactically matter.

This ""voting doesn't matter"" shit doesn't square with where I live, and I don't much care if I have to frame it as harm reduction.

And so if we not only give permission to but demand that social media companies censor us for ""inserting"" politics into stuff, we're placing a lot of faith that these companies are going to be defining ""inserting"" and ""politics"" competently and in good faith and not just using it to selectively silence narratives that might threaten their bottom line.

Still can't get him to even *try* it, though, which is frustrating given how much shit I got growing up for being picky.

It's fairly simple, it's smoked sausage (ideally andouille but that is a bit pricey and too spicy for my dad), dark chicken meat (baked beforehand so I can use the skin and bones for stock), celery, onions, bell peppers, garlic, optionally whatever spicy peppers I can get ahold of if I don't need to feed anyone with a low tolerance, crushed tomatoes, hot sauce, Worcestershire, Slap Ya Mama Cajun seasoning, thyme, basil, black pepper, salt, a bit of dark roux, and of course white rice to soak up all the flavors.

I grew up on boxed Zatarain's jambalaya so the dish is just super comfy for me. It's fairly inexpensive for how much food it makes, I can toss in leftovers from other dishes, it itself makes fine leftovers so I can have a great lunch all week. And it's just a fun routine to make - the roux when I run out of it takes hours to make but just standing there whisking while listening to podcasts is relaxing, and I can do it while waiting on the stock. And of course the stock is useful in other recipes like taco meat in place of water, since there's usually plenty more than what my Dutch oven can fit with all the other stuff that needs to go in.

Dunno, I might write down my recipe later even though much of it was lifted from sites I can no longer remember."

transhumanism,fek0i4u,t1_fejurfl,1579189986.0,"Another interesting angle is that many homeless people will have smartphones. And douchebags will give them shit for it, expecting said homeless person pawn off their phone for maybe $50 and losing something that gives them something to do in the day and lets them stay in touch with others.

So access to technology that's considered inappropriate for the underclass is seen as grounds to question their moral character, even if there's many reasons a poor person might have a nice phone and little benefit to selling it for a fraction of its real worth. To have a smartphone is still seen as a symbol of wealth and status and having one when you're not ""supposed"" to gives the observer permission to give you shit for panhandling.

It's a similar story for things like PSP's and other handheld gaming devices, anything considered a luxury in the possession of someone begging for help will frequently lead to harassment because if someone can afford to play video games then they're not seen as truly poor and desperate, or that they've brought it upon themselves and aren't living as the aesthetics the wealthy expect the poor to be in order to deserve assistance.

And, of course, we have examples of poor people's prosthetic legs being repossessed, then returned over the public outcry but then not fitted properly. An issue with the sweetass robot arms vision of transhumanism under capitalism is that these attitudes towards technology in the possession of the poor is that this can be extended to technology that could be considered part of their body.

Anarchism,fedxd4r,t1_fedsje7,1579021891.0,"ML's also want communism, which of course is stateless. They share an end goal with anarchists.

The difference is that ML's advocate creating a state that can oppress capitalists, and then having that state whither away to give rise to true communism. Anarchists, of course, would say that the state will try to perpetuate itself and those in power won't give it up willingly, and so instead call for a more severe reduction in the state or its complete abolition in the short rather than long term.

To a degree I think the conflict is overstated and deliberately stoked by chuds. Straight up tankies that advocate for the worst abuses of the USSR and the CCP typically aren't hated for their differences of opinion but rather their ghastly disregard for human life.

There's other leftists beyond just anarchists and ML's, but overall I don't see much value in continuing a pissing match in most contexts when neoliberalism is the dominant ideology. Tell the ML's to fuck off when they try to tell us to not be mean to their cops and 95% of the rest is going to be common ground."
