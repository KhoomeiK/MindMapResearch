Quick note on this. You've conflated two different types of collegiate commissioning sources. 

Service academies are schools where the students are active duty. There are three of them for the Department of Defense - the United States Military Academy at West Point, the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, and the United States Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs.

Schools like Norwich University, VMI, Texas A&M, and others are called senior military colleges. They operate ROTC detachments under a different section of the law than other universities, and they have additional requirements that set them apart from those other universities. They are required to establish a Corps of Cadets, and membership in the Corps does look a lot like what cadets and midshipmen at the service academies go through.

Quick note on this. You've conflated two different types of collegiate commissioning sources. 

Service academies are schools where the students are active duty. There are three of them for the Department of Defense - the United States Military Academy at West Point, the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, and the United States Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs.

Schools like Norwich University, VMI, Texas A&M, and others are called senior military colleges. They operate ROTC detachments under a different section of the law than other universities, and they have additional requirements that set them apart from those other universities. They are required to establish a Corps of Cadets, and membership in the Corps does look a lot like what cadets and midshipmen at the service academies go through.
