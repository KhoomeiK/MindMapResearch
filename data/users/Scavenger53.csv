They are stiff to detect vibrations and have the same weight on each end so if one side is missing, the cat will walk funny.

What is actually more ridiculous is that people do nothing about it. Kill the cops that do this, hold them to a higher standard. If civilians would normally get charged with manslaughter/murder in any of these cases, the cops should be charged 10x harder.

cpp,fet25fu,t1_fet11ve,1579371122.0,"As a beginner, stick with unique pointers. A unique pointer is basically the exact same code as 

    {
    new T;
    //do stuff
    delete T;
    }

Shared pointers are more complex and used less often, but yea they count references and you can break a weak pointer out of them to prevent reference count loops. Unique pointers and shared pointers delete when out of scope, but shared reference count has to be on the last pointer. 

My point about garbage collection was that C++ will never have it, but a smart pointer is as close as we will get. Other languages actually comb through their heap looking for  memory that is hanging and delete it every 40us or so. C++ does it immediately when it goes out of scope if you code correctly, and that is why we won't get it."
cpp,feswqb8,t1_fesvyi6,1579369726.0,"Unless you are building low level libraries or writing compiler code, you can probably use smart pointers every time.
