unitedkingdom,feoxt9k,t1_femo94o,1579307719.0,"You've failed to understand politics. Remainers waited three years for Labour to support them. Labour failed them. They went elsewhere because they didn't trust the eurosceptic Corbyn and his ilk to do the right thing. He had shown, time and time again, that he didn't care about them and wouldn't represent their interests on this matter. 

Remainers therefore deserted Labour; more remainers deserted than leavers.

You can't blame them for doing this. The LibDems offered remain. Labour offered another botched referendum with a Labour Brexit possibly promoted, with the notorious leaver Corbyn in command, backed up by Milne and McCluskey and all the other irrational Lexiters. After three years of fence-sitting and dishonesty, who would believe him? No sane person. You seem outraged that people dare to vote for a party other than Labour; this is why people voted for parties other than Labour - to avoid associating with ideologues like you.

If Labour had offered a truly soft Brexit ratified by a second referendum from the start, I'm convinced it could have brought down May's government. The support was there, in parliament and in the electorate. Labour could have shifted the Overton window to a position of rationality and not allowed May to pander to the extreme elements in her own party. Rationalism and openness could have won the day.

Instead you blame people for voting for their interests, instead of voting for a dishonest Brexiter who promised only more failure and misery. Shame on you.

Corbyn is as much at fault for Brexit as Cameron, May or Johnson. His sins are perhaps by omission, but they are clear. 

You criticise the LibDems for being decisive and strident during the most illiberal political period of my life, rather than capitulating to a minority of xenophobes and bigots. You hold liberals in contempt for attempting to preserve their rights rather than risking losing them. You ignore the fact that Labour was offered an electoral pact that could have prevented a Tory win and the certainty of Brexit. You blame others for this failure when it was purely down to the inflexibility and arrogance of the Labour leadership, which you apparently support.

Frankly I think your attitude is shameful. If tone-deaf Labour supporters like you had listened to the remain electorate years ago, instead of railroading us and pretending that you knew better, all of this could have been avoided.

But even now, passing the blame onto people like me, who voted tactically to preserve our EU rights, is more important to you than accepting the blame for Brexit and Labour's failure. Attacking natural allies for voting the way you are too afraid to vote is not a morally defensible position. For the record, I voted Labour for the first time in December because I believed it was the best way to fight the Tories and their illiberal Brexit.
