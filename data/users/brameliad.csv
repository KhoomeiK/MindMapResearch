It was #8. 

I‚Äôm also 38/39 right now and think I should just give up."
SneakySasquatch,ff1j2ly,t1_fets0xg,1579480004.0,Omg thank you so much. Having 15/16 was killing me. Was missing #8
MadeMeSmile,fegzh2a,t1_fegyeqm,1579105952.0,Adorable story. I hope your son is doing well now.
TwoXChromosomes,fef5l7b,t1_fedbetk,1579048715.0,I second the ‚Äútalk to your professor about how she got there.‚Äù It‚Äôs not easy and women need to support each other whenever possible.

offmychest,fdr3rdc,t1_fdq1pbe,1578679123.0,"I remember when I got to college, I remember thinking wow this is so much easier than high school! (And I went to a top tier school too, not easy by any means.) And then when i joined the work force, I remember thinking wow this is even easier than college! And reminiscing how difficult high school was, physically, mentally, emotionally, and academically. At the time I didn‚Äôt understand why I had to start out on hard mode. Still don‚Äôt, but reading these responses makes me realize I‚Äôm not alone."

Being somewhat removed, as I‚Äôm not quite ‚Äúimmediate family,‚Äù I just want to help out and get as much info as possible, helping be prepared for when the time comes. You‚Äôre right, even though we‚Äôve never done this before, the nurses and social workers do deal with this on a fairly regular schedule."
NoStupidQuestions,fdnky19,t1_fdnk8pr,1578587969.0,Makes sense. I guess they haven‚Äôt talked to us about it yet bc she‚Äôs still here and too much info would be too much. Thanks so much.
NoStupidQuestions,fdnia49,t1_fdmdqia,1578586381.0,One can never be too cautious when giving random internet advice. People will surprise you!
NoStupidQuestions,fdni26h,t1_fdn5bol,1578586249.0,Ditto! And the fact that it rhymes really well (rhythmically too) with the following line.

It‚Äôs a really tough situation and many women aren‚Äôt even able to acknowledge it. Please stay strong and don‚Äôt get manipulated by his sweet talk when things have calmed down. Gather your important things (passport, expensive electronics/jewelry, paperwork, etc) and put them with a trusted friend in case he comes back with any kind of retaliation. Just be careful and protect yourself. Sending love."

I know all this is just a part of life (problems get presented, you have to resolve them one by one), but it‚Äôs still so mentally and emotionally taxing. My strength comes from my own mom, and I really hope I can pass that down to my kids too. 

Losing ones parents is hard enough, but with cancer it‚Äôs almost like you lose them over and over again each time something goes wrong. Like, today, she was doing much better and I have hopes she‚Äôs on the amend but that means everyone will have to go through this whole thing again at a later time... possibly more than once. I‚Äôve never thought about cancer this way before, how it destroys your body in so many different ways you don‚Äôt even expect, but man. It sucks. :/"

CasualConversation,fcuzqf9,t3_ej1wpi,1577991733.0,"How long have you worked there, and what are your employment options afterwards? Sometimes shitty things happen, and if you have a good relationship with your manager and coworkers, it might be worth it to stick around. If this was a one time thing (and it‚Äôs reasonable that NYE be crazy and esp if things snowballed), then I would consider staying a bit through less turbulent times. However, if during the time you‚Äôve worked there and this kind of stuff keeps happening with no indication that management is working on improving anything, then I think it‚Äôs time to move on. I agree with the other poster, take the time given to you first. Then you can make your decision after getting paid for that time off."
