aww,ffevs06,t3_et8toe,1579867624.0,That is one incredibly patient cat
fatlogic,ffdfc52,t3_et03by,1579819691.0,"Last Halloween was an educational experience for my toddler. I let him eat as much as he liked and warned him he'd get a tummy ache. He did, and cried about it. We talked about cause and effect, and he agreed that candy tastes and feels better in moderation  The next year, he ate a few pieces over the course of the night, and ate one piece per day in his lunchbox and enjoyed it much more. 

There definitely is a place for letting a kid get a stomach ache from poor choices, but if you consistently cause your body harm while overeating, people will assume you have poor mental health."
fatlogic,ffckzs4,t1_ffck1vh,1579801691.0,"These are all snacks, not meals. ""After dinner snack"" implies they also ate dinner on top of the 900 in snacks."

It's awesome because when we travel, we can go to any Y in the country. We travel back and forth from GA, to IL, to CA, to FL, to VA and I travel for work. It's incredibly convenient."
insanepeoplefacebook,ffcel8d,t1_ffc8b1l,1579797787.0,Our gym allows 10 hours of child care per week per child. I have a 4 year old boy and twin 3 month old girls. Sometimes I go  just to sit in the sauna/steam room/hot tub for an hour to get some peace and quiet.

parentsofmultiples,ffc6rei,t3_eskh54,1579792840.0,My mono do twins were scheduled for C-section on 37 weeks 5 days. 38 weeks is the cut off for the practice I was working with.
insanepeoplefacebook,ffb0blr,t1_ffa2dtv,1579748655.0,"And people that use BC and it fails, married, and too old or frail or have genetic ailments that would be cruel to pass on are irresponsible? 

Also, it's hypocritical to say that it's fine to abort ""babies"" as a result of tape or incest. It's not their fault they exist. This just confirms your true intentions. Women should be punished with children for daring to have sex for pleasure."
fatlogic,ffa41tn,t1_ff9zs1s,1579727462.0,"Yep. ""thin people can be unhealthy, too!""

Yeah great, okay. But they won't be healthier if they gained 75 lbs."
fatlogic,ff9iuia,t1_ff8sbbs,1579713941.0,"It's the same thing with joint pain and arthritis. Instead of losing weight to take pressure off the joints, thin people try a bunch of different medications with side effects, surgery requiring long recovery, joint replacement, physical therapy. All things that would take longer, be harder, and less likely to be followed in a disciplined manner by people that are morbidly obese."
fatlogic,ff9eejg,t1_ff99eo9,1579711217.0,They also laughed at Bozo the Clown.
fatlogic,ff95g9e,t1_ff92f0s,1579705285.0,"Exactly. Say they got a desk job after finishing school, started eating out at lunch every day, no longer enrolled in sports with multiple hours of practice per day, could easily gain 20 lbs per year. 

Instead of the cycle of diet, go back to eating ""normally"", they would just shoot up to whatever weight for which ""eating normally"" would be maintenance."
fatlogic,ff80k67,t1_ff7wth3,1579662851.0,"FA: I'm in pain. 

Doctor: Alright, let's try physical therapy, yoga, weight loss, and an anti inflammatory diet. 

FA: No, no. I'm not changing a single thing about my lifestyle. Pills. I want pills. That's why I'm here."
fatlogic,ff7q59x,t3_es2fu7,1579655647.0,"Doctor: You have diabetes. You need to eat less carbs, and begin exercising every day to manage your blood sugar. A 5-10% reduction in weight is very achievable, and statistically will improve symptoms considerably, even potentially reversing your diagnosis. In the meantime, you need to take these pills/insulin and we'll wean you off them as you lose weight and we monitor the situation. 

FA patient: What would you recommend for a thin patient?

Doctor: You have diabetes. You need to eat less carbs, and begin exercising every day to manage your blood sugar as well as a lifetime of pills and insulin with unpleasant side effects. Unfortunately, your diabetes diagnosis is probably related to genetics and you will need to be careful the rest of your life.  

FA patient: Diabetes is genetic and there's literally nothing I can do to change that."
fatlogic,ff6ncq9,t1_ff632e9,1579630875.0,"But cutting out alcohol, soda, and juice is restriction! Everyone knows that restricting is an eating disorder, and when you will definitely 100% give up the goal of restricting, you'll absolutely binge on those things, making everything worse! Also, fat free yogurt is diet culture.

The real reason you feel better after changing your habits is because you no longer feel the stigma from society for not conforming to their expectations for applying self control."
fatlogic,ff5s7p4,t1_ff5mji3,1579608240.0,"Yes, but what would a doctor recommend to a thin person? I want the same level of care, dammit! 

Can you imagine going through all that expensive, risky, painful bullshit instead of cutting down on sweets, snacks, and extra helpings at dinner?"
