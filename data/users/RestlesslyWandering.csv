climate_science,ffa4sco,t1_ff9tptn,1579727879.0,"the only proof that was presented was ""science doesn't fully understand"" and ""this anthropologist says if he speaks out against climate change theories he will lose his job, so it must be a conspiracy.""

I'll definitely challenge them to provide evidence from primary sources, thanks for the suggestion"
climate_science,ffa4ghg,t1_ffa0khg,1579727693.0,"thanks for the well wishes!

This is a pretty odd class, it focuses on the concept of Anthoposophy. I find the teacher to be an otherwise compassionate person who is genuinely concerned with the well-being of others, yet she frequently denies scientific understanding. She crossed the line today in presenting as a fact that we do not know why the earth is warming. She even suggested I was a victim of click-bait titles...

Her perspective is one that is very skeptical and critical of modern science, so trying to argue against that viewpoint with scientific understanding seems pretty hard. There is quite a lot of battle to be done indeed, not just in this class."

On Monday, I plan on presenting some evidence of anthopogenic climate change in our discussion about environmentalism. Would you be able to suggest a few really good main points to focus on? 

Although I understand the issue, I think a little guidance from an expert would help to make more of a solid case. The teacher insinuated that I was a victim of click bait titles, so I want to be sure the argument is as sound as possible."

drugmemes,ff3oi5a,t1_ff3lg87,1579545452.0,"the potency of mushies can vary quite a bit depending on species and how they are grown. the little baby closed caps tend to have the most trippy stuff in them so they are optimal. 

aside from this, a way I've found to always catch a good buzz is by making tea. crush up your fungi with a mortar and pestle or something like that, then put them in a bowl to soak in some lemon juice for like 20-30 min. 

after they marinate in the juice, put them into a lose tea leaf holder in a cup. personally I like to throw another tea packet or two in the cup as well for the flavor. boil some water, then let the water cool off for a couple minutes before pouring it into the cup.

for the best results, do 2 or 3 rounds of hot water to get all the good stuff out. some people eat the mushies afterwords but I don't see the point in that. this method should come on swiftly and smoothly - provided the mushrooms are infact of the psychedelic variety."

NMStrangeUnusual,ff2cyr6,t3_er0tls,1579501165.0,"a couple years ago, a buddy of mine moved into place down by UNM. the house was pretty old, tucked in a dirt alley in the area that everybody calls the ""student ghetto,"" just a stones toss away from a cemetery. 

one night I went over to hang out and check the place out. when I arrived, his room mate had an Ouija board out and was joking around about it. apparently, according to the landlord, the old house with an odd layout was at one time used as a tuberculosis home back in the day when people were coming to NM seeking relief from respiratory ailments like that. so my friend's room mate thought we should give the board a try and see if there were any lingering entities in the house. 

after a couple hours of sitting around drinking beer and chatting, we decided to try the board and see what would happen. so I'm a fairly skeptical person, and it takes a lot to give me a spook, but damn this sure did it. 

we started by focusing our intentions and observing some silence. after this, we posited a few pretty vague and easy to answer questions. initially, we got what could be considered some answers. to the question of how many spirits are in the room, the answer was 5. after a couple more specific questions and a lack of movement from our hands on the cursor, one of the guys started to openly doubt the existence of anything other than us in the house. as we were laughing off the moment, the sound of a grandfather clock chimed.

this shut us all up. we quickly checked the windows and saw that none were open, and confirmed that there was in fact no grandfather clock or really any clocks at all set up in the house. after making sure it was nobody's phone or anything like that, we sat back down to the board and continued to ask questions. after awhile of a lack of response, just as we were preparing to dismiss the whole thing, the sound of the clock chimed again. 

this time everyone was freaked out pretty hard, and the Ouija board was put away. all the time I spent in that house, I never heard the sound of the clock again, but I also never forgot it. thanks for reading, sorry if that went a little long. just a crazy experience that I don't get to share too often. 

tl;dr: heard the sound of a grandfather clock chiming while playing with an Ouija board in an old tuberculosis home"

worldnews,ff1yhn1,t1_ff1v92r,1579489098.0,"thats part of my point, viewing sexual desires between two consenting adults as some kind of personal moral failing seems like a really unhealthy perspective for the general population. it creates an environment within the ministry and the congregation where sex gets an awkward connotation, especially for young people.

from my 20 years with the Catholic church, it seems to me that their stance on sex has the potential to be more harmful than helpful for everyone involved."
worldnews,ff1xjdp,t1_ff1wevz,1579488449.0,"I understand that they see it a whole different light, with religious context and all, but priests are still denying a deep seeded biological urge by agreeing to refrain from intercourse. Not saying that every person who vows celibacy is destined for deviance, it just seems possible that such a denial of primal drives could manifest in unhealthy and socially unacceptable behaviors in some people - absolutely in those with the issues you speak of.

Take the whole ""chi boy"" thing in Afghanistan. Yes it is a completely different culture, but the faith of a population of males there forbids sexual intercourse with women w/o being married. Since they cannot have female partners, the men turn to boys for sexual gratification. I think the culture of the christian church does have an effect on the behavior of it's ministers and patrons, albeit not as extreme or in the open as in Afghanistan."
worldnews,ff1qj50,t1_ff1pi20,1579483958.0,is it really that stupid though? it's not hard to imagine how a sworn life of chastity could influence deviant behaviors to an extent. the whole taboo around sexuality found in Christianity/Catholicism seems pretty unhelpful for explaining safe and healthy ways for people to have sexual relationships - which is a facet of life that predates most all religions.
musictheory,ff15bkb,t1_ff10564,1579475373.0,"the thing that makes me think that at least parts of Vibin Out are in a compound meter is the melody of the vocal track right as the drums come in at around 1 minute. the lyrics go / Clouds in my / Shroud in my / Vis-ion grow / Clear-ly - / which makes triplets over the slow organ.
