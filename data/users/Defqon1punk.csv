Whatcouldgowrong,fegalzt,t1_feg8d8g,1579085101.0,"That wasn't even the overall point of this verbal exchange. I'll clarify for you. ""Dad"" jokes are stereotypical intentionally bad puns that have become popularly known because to many of us, our dads were well versed in this tradition. Many jokes were also themed around dads. That's really it. Guy simply says he is proud of his daughter for making a good joke (with a bit of hyperbole). Asshat here goes trigger mode over 1. Is dad really proud? 2. Are people faking being a dad for reddit? 3. Do dads really act like this in real life? 

Yeah. All of this was a thing before reddit existed, and before this creature was a ball-fish in his nonexistant pops testes. Now, if you'll see exhibit B:

Check his username, his comments, and the subs he frequents. Hint- total piece of shit comes up quick. He clearly thinks he is hilarious, but he seems young and borderline handicapped. I doubt he has a dad, nor a mom, nor a sense of humor, nor a fucking frontal lobe or cortex to match. I know if I was his dad, I'd be doing the 20 year cigarette run. 

If you're going to be a lil bish over (apparently foreign) jokes you dont understand and then be antagonistic to a guy just literally being a proud dad, you probably should reevaluate whatever dreadful bs your life is. 

Oh, and proud dad nailed it too, already.
>what are you doing with your life?

He should learn to troll, you should learn to research before irrelevant ""maybe"" statements spoken from the rear."

addiction,feg18xo,t1_feft3gy,1579072604.0,"It may be up to the sponsor, I wouldn't be sure. However, I guess we would need more info. Think of it like a psychology session. Did you finish the drink after you knew? Did you have a second? Did you trip, slip, or lose your grip over it in any way? 

It would be understandable to have feelings from the past triggered by this, but unless you went out of your way to have the drink, made excuses (oh just one wont hurt!), or in some way lowered your standards / lost control or sight of your goals and values,... I dont see any logical reason being slipped something unaware would count as a relapse. 

If anything, I think your concern in this post displays the opposite idea of someone ""relapsing"". Guess that depends on the definition, but I'd say it's about the behavior, not the mere existence of alcohol. If someone walked passed you smoking a cigarette and you caught a whiff, would you say you started smoking again, briefly? ...OK, but what if you purposely stayed close to them for it? That's the behavior.

When presented this way, I think most people in a sponsorship setting would be understanding. As another said, though, you could still go for the other option for principle. Even if you dont reset your days, it would likely be helpful to not forget this event and to keep exploring the dynamic of your relationships with friends, family, peers, and how they support or affect you in your efforts.
