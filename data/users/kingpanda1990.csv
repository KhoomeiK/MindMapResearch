Look kid, we know what you think of yourself, you’re just super deprived of dopamine because you’re on social media all the fucking time.

offmychest,fdmfrc4,t3_em5afy,1578548416.0,"This sounds heavy, friend. I’m sorry life dealt such an experience. But you’ve done the right thing in expressing yourself here, it always feels good to let loose and express what’s on our minds. Good on you!

If you haven’t already, express it to those who matter the most, your family and most especially your sister. If you do talk to her, I know I’m stating the obvious but do so in a way that doesn’t attack/ guilt her, but rather emphasises expression of emotion on your own behalf and how much you care about her. Although suicide is often a complex thing, she needs to know that someone truly cares.

Take care friend :)"
bald,fdkwi5t,t3_ek2nzq,1578512602.0,"Honestly man, shaved looks better on you. Previous photo, the hair added roundness to the look and gives it a bit of a soft look. The shaved look however creates a nice edged look and it looks more mature, almost dangerous even!"
mealtimevideos,fdcs29o,t3_ekdemo,1578282683.0,I have never EVER been one to condone the bias of Fox News and Tucker Carlson’s statements BUT I am truly shocked to see how introspective and thoughtful his statements are here.
