aspergers,fewl0s2,t3_eqpvy3,1579413164.0,Idk because I'm only just finding out about my autism but if so that does explain the lack of emotion on the day my grandmother died and for days after. I loved that woman but when she died i didn't cry until 4 days later when a cop stopped me at 5 am.

EDAnonymous,fewji96,t3_eqpx7j,1579411886.0,Slow your weight loss aka decrease your deficit. The weight loss will be way less noticeable to them so they have time to adjust to the body you already have. Or maintain for a while so they think you stopped. They will forget all about it most likely.

BodyAcceptance,feto3ro,t3_eqioz0,1579377468.0,"Nobody really cares about stretch marks and acne but ourselves. I completely get not liking your body. I don't like my body at all for many reasons but i refuse to let that be a reason i abuse my body again. I dont have to like my body to treat it with love. My mother always told me ""you dont have to like your brother but you do have to love him"" i think this can be applied to many aspects of our lives."
EDAnonymous,feb3x2b,t3_eo7ek3,1578955215.0,Are you sedentary and lack muscle? Im the same height and maybe 8 lbs less than you and my tdee is 1700. I'm moderately active. Perhaps you are thinking of bmr? Tdee is very different.
fuckeatingdisorders,feanht1,t3_eo75sh,1578950580.0,If you described your eating habits and thoughts surrounding eating would the majority of healthy minded people be worried for you? They would. Thing is that we try not to draw attention to our habits so we don't have to stop.
EDAnonymous,feam434,t1_feako4b,1578950235.0,Yeah a common thing with insecure people is to seem overly confident to the point that it's actually just cringy. It's seems to fake and i hate it.

fuckeatingdisorders,fe679cm,t3_envj5o,1578883371.0,You know how we would sit through the hunger pangs because we had a goal in mind? That's what i did in recovery. I hated every second of it but i did it anyway. When you start pushing back at your disorder and started feeling that pain and those tears as you struggle to finish a meal that's your validation that you are actually struggling. Weight has nothing to do with it at all. Most of us struggled the most when we weren't too skinny. Inpatient is to save you from dying at any moment so doctors just go by bmi. But this shouldn't invalidate you because doctor's aren't actually that helpful half the time. You have to have a no bullshit attitude towards recovery and stop searching for coping mechanisms to avoid the real problems. It's hard and i still slip up sometimes but i haven't intentionally lost weight since i commited to recovery. I don't allow it anymore.
zerocarb,fe64ts3,t3_envozy,1578881806.0,Microwaves damage the nutrient content of the food. Also are you allergic or intolerant of milk. Big difference. Allergic to milk means you get a severe reaction to it. I solved my dairy intolerance as a kid. I couldn't drink milk but cheese has less lactose so i was able to get my body adjusted to dairy. Now i can add milk to my coffee or cereal if i want to but i just don't like milk that much. I can eat half a tub of icecream when I'm in the mood for that. You slowly up your dairy till your body adjusts. It may mean starting out with a very small amount at first but it works.
fatpeoplestories,fe643xp,t3_entj4a,1578881346.0,I suggest you try an elimination diet. This can help you find out what foods cause more harm to your body than good. There are a variety of elimination diets out there but they are temporary restrictions except of course the foods you find out you can't eat. Also keeping track of these foods and how you feel after and at the end of the day. I did this to help recovery in anorexia and purging because the damage i did to my stomach caused food allergies. Also keep in mind that often times what people consider healthy is totally wrong. They told us canola oil was healthy for us when it's actually toxic ransid oil originally used for automobiles.

EdAnonymousAdults,fe34wdb,t1_fe0s2qh,1578845939.0,I mean men with muscle and typically tall. Plus with a restrictive eating disorder your metabolism slows itself.
fuckeatingdisorders,fdz29rx,t3_encte5,1578785918.0,Ugh yeah my disorder made it basically impossible to sit down and read. I even started teaching myself how to read and pace my room at the same time. Eds are so dumb sometimes
EdAnonymousAdults,fdy2fa3,t3_en7ppl,1578775330.0,Well all those things you listed tend to have a lot of calories and this is coming from a perspective of someone who does eat normally now. Most people who eat those things frequently are over eating but for a man it's a bit easier to eat those things whenever without gaining.
fuckeatingdisorders,fdsnhwr,t3_emv4wk,1578705518.0,Good for you! I miss peanut butter so much but the oils in it cause so much stomach pain that i can't eat some of my old favorite foods that have vegetable oils. Stupid ED ruining my body.
BodyAcceptance,fdsms3q,t3_emxakv,1578705259.0,"Im so lucky (i guess) to not be around anybody. So i don't have to hear all that talk. Try to reframe those thoughts you have and tell yourself they may be doing something but their situation doesn't apply to your situation. It takes repeating thoughts to rewire the brain to start thinking more positive thoughts on it's own. This is were affirmations used in witchcraft come from and is backed by science. It's very hard to build positive habits but it works. I used this and many other aspects of my craft to help me along the way in recovery.
Hope this helps! Also please ignore my awful username it was made while i was struggling."

EdAnonymousAdults,fdsglry,t1_fdrmw8j,1578702333.0,Lol thanks. I kept it even after recovery cause it is a part of my past and i cant hide that.
EdAnonymousAdults,fdri0lc,t3_emskbg,1578684762.0,Im in a poly relationship and all 3 of us have ED's. I'm voluntarily recovering but the other two just watch eachother and make sure the other one doesn't start restricting again. Which makes them both just unhappy about their bodies with a disordered mindset.
fatlogic,fdrgohq,t3_emszsq,1578684250.0,Hi my body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria wanna say f off we'll wear what we want to. Just cause nobody makes clothes bigger than you doesn't mean you get to gatekeep style.
EdAnonymousAdults,fdrer72,t3_ems87f,1578683546.0,I recommend getting a meal reminder app and following that. Intuitive eating just doesn't work for people who don't get hunger que's regularly. Intuitive eating was the reason i stayed underweight long before my ED started and it can keep normal & overweight people unhealthy too. HAES people intuitively eat and they aren't healthy. Just find something that works for YOU not what other people say you need to do.
1200isplenty,fdi3ack,t1_fdh2nto,1578434966.0,"I get that the language in places such as 1200isfineiguess where they make jokes like disordered folks but a lot of them are just joking around as every does to cope with addictions. This thread is meant for people who want HEALTH. But disordered folks will use these threads all the time for their own means. And body acceptance is different than what is often pushed everywhere now. They push intuitive eating despite the fact that many of the people here would literally DIE if they did that. You wanna tell that 600 pound man that he should eat when he is hungry and stop when he's full. You want to tell that naturally underweight girl to not bother pushing herself to eat more because her body ""knows"" what it's doing? I'm happy that intuitive eating worked for you. But many of us can't do that. I want mac and cheese right now but I know if I try to eat it it will literally cause me so much pain that I will break down crying the rest of the day. Not everyone was raised with healthy eating habits. And yeah my disorder started as losing a few pounds too. But I spent my whole life past puberty at the same weight and I saw what my laziness and constant munching was doing to my body after depression hit. I was already suffering from depression really badly and that is why I chose to starve myself instead of eat myself into the grave. Neither is a good habit and the body acceptance community has turned into fat acceptance and health at every size which is frankly not true to the extent that they push. I see so many recovered anorexics develop the opposite disorder because they chose to follow intuitive eating. We need a diverse set of methods for helping disordered folk not just saying ""fat ain't so bad just accept it"". That is every anorexics biggest fear."
EDAnonymous,fdfec2m,t3_el09fg,1578359699.0,Well for starters you don't need the scale to lose weight. You build a routine and healthy foods to stick to at least 80% of the time. You know what foods are high in calories and you know when you aren't eating enough. You'll know your losing weight when you stick to your plan just by looking at your body. I've got bad body dysmorphia but i can still tell when my stomach is bigger or smaller. Some people have used this method of losing weight: figure out how many calories a healthy weight of your height eats every day and eat that and stick to that. You'll slowly but surely lose weight without really having to focus so much on food. For me that number is 1800 if I'm moderately active and 1700 if i don't go to the gym. Im really short though.
1200isplenty,fdfczva,t3_el2kt8,1578358794.0,I've tried so many times to explain this to the eating disorder community and they think I'm just proana or something. I'm recovered for the most part. They think that everyone needs to eat their tdee because they all fall for the fat acceptance bs that seeped into the anorexia recovery community. They think fasting is disordered no matter what. It's bonkers. Y'all are trying to save yourself from obesity related illnesses not get an eating disorder. There's a different mindset from a disordered person and a person trying to get healthier. Personally i think their disorders make them see everything as an ED.
CICO,fdfagj3,t3_el2tzh,1578357092.0,For a regular churro it's 240 calories (60g). White chocolate is about 500 for 3 ounces. It looks like almost 2 regular churros and close to 3 ounces of chocolate. An ounce is like a shot glass so not that much chocolate. I'd estimate around 1000 calories give or take a hundred.

EdAnonymousAdults,fdc6gky,t3_ekj44n,1578268035.0,Anyone using fasting to get to a dangerous weight has an eating disorder. An overweight person fasting because they hate themselves is an eating disorder. But someone trying to lose weight because they know their weight is a dangerous high then i think that's healthy. Doing something for your health and not for the weight or getting a perfect body isn't an eating disorder. Some people are trying to save their lifes while others are just trying to find themselves beautiful. Not every WOE is unhealthy or always used in unhealthy ways. A disordered mindset is what distinguishes the two. Of course their are so many of us using those forums for our own gain but that shouldn't dirty the reputation of said group.
BodyAcceptance,fcvhmwr,t3_eizo05,1578002276.0,"For starters you can point out that 110 pounds is the minimum weight for health at your height. Well one pound shy of the minimum. Also the best way to react is to show how offended you are. When people realize that their behavior has consequences they often will either change or get out of you life. Unless they have narcissim and then they won't stop no matter what you do. You can fake the confidence till it becomes a real thing. Say things like ""well I'm enjoying my food so i don't really care what you think"" or ""if I'm not good enough for you then you can leave"". Also there are people out there everywhere who will like whatever body type/weight anybody has. And finally you can tell your partner's ""if you dont love me someone else will"""
EDAnonymous,fcvfmla,t3_ej14g1,1578001083.0,That's exactly what helped me in the start. I had to fake it for a while to be able to get the metaphorical ball rolling. I eventually got upset that i never enjoyed the meal and instead dissociated during it so i started pushing myself to focus during the meal and enjoy myself. It's a great tactic for when you struggle to feed yourself.

EDAnonymous,fcvex23,t3_eiwmix,1578000663.0,"Don't excuse his behavior with ""well we all make mistakes"". Calling him out on his BS can help him grow as man. Only children say things without thinking about them first. It's perfectly normal to have slip ups where your words come off different than you intended but this is just outright mean and inappropriate to say to anyone. I grew up hearing these off color things about everyone's appearance and still grew up realizing that it was inappropriate to say to people. Help him grow as a person not enable his behavior."
fatlogic,fcuf3ih,t3_eixjc6,1577979428.0,Do they not realize that this can give an anorexic an excuse not to recover? If health doesn't matter why do FA's shit on skinny people so much?
omad,fcu7gx4,t3_eiq5py,1577974370.0,You mentioned feeling really full and not being able to finish it all. Try reducing the carbs a little and adding in calories from fat. It's more calorically dense so you can get your calories in easier. Don't force your stomach to stretch to fit the food in if it's uncomfortable. You could cook your spinach in ghee or coconut oil and take out the banana for example. If you get sugar cravings and need that banana maybe try a fruit that has more calories such as mangoes.
fuckeatingdisorders,fcu5c36,t3_eixpu3,1577972930.0,"The ideas the other person mentioned are good ideas. If your body fat percentage is too low for your body or you arent near your set point range you still have some ways to go. If your weight and BF is normal then there is something your body isn't getting from your food. Do you tend to eat some foods more than other's? This can cause vitamin imbalances. Other nutrients deplete other nutrients when ""overconsumed"". I find writing what i eat and how i feel throughout the day  helps so i can look back at what foods make me feel awful. I use this for the gut issues my AN and BN caused me. It's possible that you are eating foods that are triggering a response in you body to push the food out and not digest fully causing you to feel unsatisfied and lacking nutrients. Allergy development in eating disorders are common."
fuckeatingdisorders,fctf1le,t1_fct19tg,1577941189.0,Nobody fills their whole life with food (restricting or overeating) just because of weight. It's never just about weight. It's a coping mechanism for a life that is left unfulfilled.
EDanonymemes,fcsd4jh,t1_fcrqggf,1577914863.0,"that wasn't keto. Keto is based on a high fat diet not high protein. Low carb yes but nobody sane has ever advised people to eat only protein. Also if we wanna talk fad diets then lets mention every other diet such as vegetarian, vegan, whole 30, elimination, HCLF, the standard american diet. Every way of eating can be warped into an unhealthy totally bonkers ana diet."
fuckeatingdisorders,fcscblh,t1_fcrwdup,1577914545.0,"Thank you for the support. 

I mean I have anorexia but I also have serious food intolerance's to many foods so that means restricting what I eat but not the calories. Also if a person has BED they likely need to lose weight eventually. Also fasting isn't inherently bad for the human body. It's actually how humans evolved otherwise the human race wouldn't exist because you couldn't always eat every few hours. It's about balancing yourself and building discipline to not go back to your old ways. I slip up from time to time but I don't beat myself up over it and just cave into the restriction, I pick myself back up and if that takes eating and crying over an egg burrito (actually happened) then I do it. And I was only trying to help in other ways besides the distraction techniques that were already provided for them.  Also binge eating and extreme hunger are totally different. One is caused from emotional hunger and filling a void inside them. while the other is due to lack of nutrients. Finding the foods that make OP feel the best can help with this lack of nutrients issue that could be happening. Not everyone needs to go all in and stephanie buttermore clearly has her own issues because the food she is binging on aren't even that good for the body and you don't absorb all nutrients from your food in the first place. Hint why she is now overweight and unhappy with her body."
EDAnonymous,fcraifx,t3_eik7nl,1577899141.0,I used to love peanut butter so much. The smell was better than sex. But after recovering in weight i don't get that same euphoria from smelling it. It smells worse almost. It's a love-hate relationship.
ShittyRestrictionFood,fcr7xiy,t3_eigjk6,1577898088.0,Oh god that sf hersheys is so gross. Even my ED was like nope this aint worth it.
fuckeatingdisorders,fcr7mb5,t3_eiirz6,1577897949.0,"You may need to experiment with the foods you eat and when you eat to find something that works for you. Some binge eaters that are recovering do omad as they can feel satisfied and the fasting will lower your appetite over time. You just have to make sure your meal is big enough. Also remember to drink water and if diet soda helps you feel fuller between meals then do that. Although most would never recommend drinking diet sodas. Keep track of your meals and how you feel before, during and after so you can have data to look back on and make adjustments."

EDAnonymous,fcbkuvn,t3_egtqaq,1577588040.0,I actually agree with you. Nobody maintains a healthy weight at such high calories. 3000 is totally reasonable yes but 5000 no way. She's so hungry all the time because she still eats shit food with little to no nutrition. She needs to find a more balanced diet with the occasional treats/junk. She lives off carbs which arent actually essential because the body can make it through protein and fat which are essential.
