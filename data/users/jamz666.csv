me_irl,ffah69j,t3_eshgel,1579735643.0,Oh come on man. I've had friends who are gay and friends I didnt know were gay try on me and the least you can do is be nice. Reassure them that it's fine that they asked and encourage them to be more open about themselves so they can really find someone. Dont be a dick and make him think he was stupid for trying.

edit: Ace Attorney is awesome btw. Just bought the collection for my switch last week and I'm taking my time so I'm still on the first one."
u_SrGrafo,ffag265,t1_ffa72no,1579734911.0,not really. adding a button press to interrupt a video is pretty simple. Giving it a single variable (such as only implement in NG+) would take very little dev time.
drawing,ffae0uw,t3_es7dnp,1579733384.0,That's pretty awesome actually. I like the ha he's like that one pic of the comic joker gripping his head but the fact that you switched it to the Joaquin and he is decidedly NOT smiling gives it a really uneasy feeling.

It wouldn't be crazy if a couple of them shared the same dark poetry on their's I'm sure it was good to know you had a brother out there somewhere, even if you're separated from the platoon and alone."
u_SrGrafo,ff9w1ci,t1_ff9vvu5,1579722747.0,i'm with you on that. I just know that there are Devs who leave out the skip option on purpose to force you to experience the story (although i also think that a game that NEEDS cutscenes for it's story isn't a very good story game) but i was looking for a compromise.

shittydarksouls,fenxwhb,t1_fen8d3k,1579292475.0,There are theories that all the games are connected in some ways. Not sure I buy it but it would be kinda cool if the centipedes or the dragon caused immortality which warped the world into the dark souls universe or the bloodborne one. All overseen by eldritch monsters.
todayilearned,fenrqnf,t1_femi3z7,1579289802.0,but the fact that he went about it the way he did kind of discounts the opinions. I haven't read it all the way through but i do know that a lot of people arent willing to even look at it because they just consider him a psycho killer. Would have been harder to do without killing or bombing but at least we would have been more willing to hear him out. I would at least.

gaming,fenqoi7,t1_fenjsvs,1579289409.0,I liked the duke (original giant controller) but the redesign was perfect for me. I didn't even like the 360 controllers as much as that even though they are nearly the same.
gaming,fenqfow,t1_feniz7b,1579289261.0,seems possible.
gaming,fenihn5,t1_fenajo6,1579285409.0,Same. The OG xbox controller was my most comfortable but gamecube is a close second.

spaceporn,fem8o8o,t1_fem8iv1,1579243812.0,I consider it impossible because it's almost unfathomable to me that something that size can move that fast.

WhitePeopleTwitter,fem8ir0,t1_felv263,1579243640.0,"I've been through a 2 different mental health facilities and I can confirm. They are very understaffed, underpaid and sometimes undertrained even. They all do their best and they do a great job most of the time but they NEED funding and both places definitely needed more trained psychiatrists or even just trained psychological therapists, but they need more."
spaceporn,fekveo9,t1_fek6qim,1579208397.0,it's insane. that's how fast. I swear if you look it up you'll find the same thing. Neutron stars are one of those celestial bodies that acts in a way we CURRENTLY think is impossible. Yet there it is.
shittydarksouls,fejzzx8,t3_ep3cie,1579189671.0,Aaaaand you must suck at dark souls if you're only limited to a single class build.
spaceporn,fejh30v,t1_fejaass,1579173931.0,well also they're known to rotate at speeds that we would consider impossible unless we knew it was happening. Neutron stars can spin upwards of 700 times a second. White dwarfs would be way easier to observe.
WhitePeopleTwitter,feizgoy,t1_feiz6nw,1579151623.0,"Honestly that sounds just like how they talk. ""Don't know where you been"" probably wasn't meant to be offensive, just a turn of phrase. I have met some dickweed panhandlers now that I think on it. I usually meet them when they aren't actually panhandling but it's their main income. Some I can see doing what OP said. But like I said, it tends to come up as Rule no. 1. Be nice even if they don't give you anything. Otherwise, you won't get anything at all."
WhitePeopleTwitter,feiviyb,t3_epa724,1579148356.0,This sounds like a rich guys fake story about trying to give change to the poor. I've known a LOT of panhandlers or people who have panhandled from time to time and the first thing is to be gracious. What if the next guy was about to give you some money and he saw you being a dick over small change? This whole post stinks.

spaceporn,feit5pj,t1_feisyyy,1579146545.0,it's just... a crazy texture. I've been in an astronomy class this last semester and I couldn't have imagined it looked like this. It makes me curious about if we could get footage like this of a white dwarf or a neutron star.

todayilearned,feierhz,t1_fehq3kw,1579136817.0,it is better for us to use fair procedure when dealing with them though. It shows that our way is the better way and is effective at punishing those guilty of those crimes. (doesn't mean i'm not tickled pink when Nazi's get offed by any method but it's the difference between right and wrong.  And the thing that stops us turning into them.)
