hiphop101,feq2288,t1_fen4uv9,1579336380.0,Rip The Jacker is another - produced by Stroupe who makes beats for Jedi Mind Tricks and AOTP and the latter are absolute hard as shit workout music. It's also Canibus' best lyrical album too.

Freddie Gibbs (might be rated properly)

Cabnibus

Big L (not sure what his following his or how properly rated he is but he damn sure needs a mention)

Frankly I'd be surprised if most people here have even heard of Cannibal Ox. And Canibus gets looked over because of the LL and Em shit but dude is CRAZY talented. His vocabulary/metaphor usage is probably second only to Aesop and [No Return](https://youtu.be/FrEsc3l4kWM) is proof.

Apathy and Celph titled honorable mentions."

But absolutely RJD2 as a single act is revolutionary. His songs aren't instrumentals to me - they tell a story. 1976 was the first song I heard by him and I immediately loved him. Then Ghostwriter, 2 More Dead and Iced Lightning....man I could go on and on. 

Yo Day Job is dope as hell. Quintessential 90s beat with the smooth flow over it. I never even heard of those guys. Good looks man.

Masta Ace good call he's a dope MC. As far as your rule of thumb I agree - if you need to brag about how much dope you sold, then you probably didn't. There are 2 exceptions to this: Jay-Z and Pusha T and I fucking love the two of them (Drug Dealers Anonymous I mean come on). I still believe The Story Of Adidon is right up there with Ether as the greatest diss track ever. 

Push as a personality is one of my favorite dudes - so down to earth and friendly. But he's distant second to Cudi for me. I won't go into detail but Cudi being outspoken about his struggles with suicide has been and remains incredibly helpful. He means a lot to me."

hiphop101,fem0l34,t1_fekz2p5,1579235912.0,"Their music is so unique mainly because of Kno. Absolute most underrated hip hop producer alive, and it's not even close.

One of their better songs."

Bde Maka Ska is so dope. Everyone complains that it's ""dad rap"" but they totally returned to their roots on it. It's got a Life Gives You Lemons vibe. 

THE ABUSING OF THE RIB. I don't even need to say anything more. 

What you think of the Proof song?"
hiphop101,fel1sxn,t1_fekye2z,1579212210.0,Eyedea could've been one of the greats. His freestyle with Slug on Sway's show is still to this day the best freestyle I've ever heard
hiphop101,fel1mvp,t1_fekyxcb,1579212107.0,"Bro that's my all time favorite song. My first tat will be something related on both hands. 

I heard it in college and just got lost in Slug's words. The way he tells that story...so many great lines in that song. The River I was late to the party but his vibe on that song is just..relatable.  You heard the song Kurt Kobain by Proof? Same beat as Tattoed Hands and he kills it as well. Welp we just became friends too."

 Check out different restaurants first. Big restaurants, chain restaurants, small family owned, all sorts. Observe how the bartenders are - how busy they are, what kind of drinks are most people drinking (some places are all cocktails, some are mostly wine, some are a mix,) it all depends on the place. See how many bartenders are working at each place. I've worked at a place where there were three bartenders and I currently work at a place where I'm the only one and no bar back. You'll get a good idea of what environment feels comfortable for you. 

After that, apply to places. If you're outgoing and personable then you'll get hired somewhere. From there, you'll get trained and likely pick things up fairly quickly. It'll take time to learn the more advanced drinks but if you enjoy the job then you'll get there eventually.
