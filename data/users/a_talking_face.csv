Yikes. Just begging to get destroyed by someone trying to make the light."
trashy,ffg44su,t1_ffg2tyx,1579898054.0,Can’t speak to accounting but one program that lawyers use is a program called Intapp Time to time their work and then create time entries that can be directly exported into billing software.

Edit: and it looks like UCFs undergrad rate is $212.28 per credit hour."

coolguides,ffdg4ml,t1_ffddopl,1579820162.0,It doesn’t matter what chemically happened. The terminology that is used when ordering steak is what matters when you’re ordering steak.
politics,ffdcvab,t1_ffca35l,1579818198.0,In the article it says the debt would have increased regardless of who was president because of spending that was passed in the previous administration. They would come off looking stupid if they brought this up.

TIHI,ffc951w,t1_ffc3cit,1579794373.0,It’s really not that ridiculous. Most donated books are just getting pushed around other places because nobody wants them. The used bookstore I go to puts hundreds of books outside the store every week because they need to get rid of them and nobody touches them.
MurderedByWords,ffbyt19,t1_ffbxviy,1579787052.0,It’s just a convenient cum receptacle. You’re not actually using it in the process of rubbing one out.

youseeingthisshit,ffb24bj,t1_ffax7sl,1579749875.0,They were no more in the way than anybody else there. I was at the aquarium over the weekend and this guy was taking the same picture of the back of his wife and child’s head in front of the tanks over and over. They were taking up the same amount of space as these two.
StardewValley,ffan1lb,t1_ffajoou,1579739792.0,Back in my day we had this feature called “favorites” or “bookmarks” where you could simply add it to your favorites and get to it whenever you wanted to. You could even use a keyboard shortcut to do it.

USF,ffa0gpl,t3_esh7jf,1579725387.0,"What’s next is that money is going to get returned to the originating bank account(the school). I’m not aware of any way to reroute the transfer once it’s already been initiated. The funds should get returned to USF within a few days(if not the next day). As far as how long it would take them to get a check cut, I’m not sure. I would call them back and specifically ask them what your options are. You might be able to have them reinitiate the transfer using the new information."

GetMotivated,ff66fgk,t1_ff5jvm6,1579620258.0,That’s funny because nobody was talking about wages at all before you brought it up in the first place as some type of counterpoint to buying a car.
coolguides,ff660jp,t1_ff3ry5r,1579619973.0,If you’re paying for bananas individually you’re buying them in the wrong place. You should be buying them by weight.

hiphopheads,ff441a2,t1_ff406eg,1579555064.0,"This a stupid argument because those children were routinely treated like trash.

Oh and comparing his relationship with his wife and children to a slave master raping black women is fucking idiotic."
baseball,ff422mk,t1_ff3mkjd,1579553853.0,I would think realistically it would just be a marketing signing similar to Tebow where they can just be like “Hey come watch this famous football guy play baseball!”.
PublicFreakout,ff3vpf5,t1_ff3tzca,1579549881.0,The difference is that traumatic brain injury from football is not usually linked to a single event like you could a spinal injury in wrestling.
