unpopularopinion,ff5ewx8,t1_ff4m324,1579589921.0,"I mean vast majority of subjects online, where ever you go, youtube, reddit, facebook if youre into that, are flooded with internal politics of USA. If you go to youtube, youre more likely to see what the president of USA is doing, and how the US primary elections are going, what the different candidates are doing/saying, than you are seeing, i see that here in Finland all the time, but im pretty sure you dont see how Finnish internal politics are going. We're flooded with that shit by Americans not exactly because we're interested and seek it, but its impossible not to encounter those posts or videos, and when you encounter something, youre gonna form an opinion on it, whether you liked it or not, intended it or not.

Edit: Population of USA is 327 000 000, population of Canada is 37 000 000, population of Australia is 27 000 000, Population of UK is 66 000 000. So thats USA 370 000 000 vs rest English majority speaking countries 130 000 000, and theres 5 000 000 Finnish, and not many more finnish speakers. And i dont speak French, Dutch, Russian or what ever, i see Finnish stuff, and English stuff, and finnish stuff is often drowned out by english stuff, and english stuff is Flooded with Americans."

PublicFreakout,ff2ik09,t3_er5ygm,1579507689.0,"Yeah, in Sweden a pride parades have to avoid Muslim populated areas. I mean a lot of immigrants (but not all) from a country with religion enforced by state are often fundamentalist in their religion, which isn't all too kind towards LGBT, apostates or in some areas ""infidels"" for instance Malmö where Jews and Christians had to flee the city, due to increase in antisemitic attacks, similar cases in France ""No go zones"" where you'll be attacked if you're white.

But god forbid you bring up those occurrences of unrest, or homophobia, yer a racist, Harry."

unpopularopinion,fed30ky,t3_eiavnl,1578996244.0,"What you're talking about is intelligence, and there's good amount of research on the topic of intelligence - what it is, how is it present in different people, and also on the topic of different type of intelligence. Quite a good number of psychologists agree on the topic of there being general intelligence and special intelligence. For instance Louis L. Thurstone's experiments discovered seven primary categories of intelligence:  numerical, reasoning, spatial, perceptual, memory, verbal fluency and verbal comprehension. 

There's some disagreement in the field of psychology on intelligence, there's numerous theories of intelligence, but majority ones and the most relied upon agree on existence of different categories of intelligence - there existing more than just one type of intelligence. There is a reason modern day intelligence tests include verbal tests, mathematical tests and visual tests.

Studies suggest that intelligence is hereditary. If you're scored below average of intelligence as a kid, you're gonna be below average as an adult. Reading and studying improves intelligence somewhat, but it wont bring you from below average to above average.

There's good amount of text you can find on the subject of intelligence online. By no means am i even a psychology student, but there's information online enough to make somewhat educated opinions on the matter."
