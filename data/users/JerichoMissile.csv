Maybe there is something in the documentation for Wear OS notifications:

https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/notifications

My guess is, based on the error message, that to be approved to be a Wear OS app and get listed in the Wear OS Play Stores your app has to do more then show a notification on a watch.  Otherwise any app can display a simple notification and get listed as a Wear OS app.

From your description it sounds like your app isn't violating that.  It's almost as if the Dev Console thinks your app is a notification only.
