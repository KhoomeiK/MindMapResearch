dogs,fezqv34,t3_eqzbt0,1579460503.0,"with the move, i would just not get a puppy and try to adopt an older dog who is at least mostly potty trained and probably knows the ins and outs of being a house dog. (assuming they will not be spending the majority of their time outside.) besides that, i say 100% yes. my roommate/cousin recently lost her dog and she said she just felt like she needed another dog to help her get through the grieving process. she got her new dog about 3 weeks after the other passed. it definitely helped her. she no longer felt miserable all the time, but still honored the other dog's memory."
tipofmytongue,fezp8cq,t1_fezk250,1579459939.0,thats what i was thinking but i couldn't remember the timeline of the deaths. i don't think the son ever died but the girl got hit by the car because she was going after Church the cat. (i think...)

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fez4ull,t3_eqnq8v,1579453875.0,"i hate guests that can do NOTHING for themselves. someone called my hotel asking if it was ""the one in x town"" (i had no idea what she was even trying to say at first) and i told her no we are in y town.

""Oh. Well you got their number?"" No maam I have never heard of that town but you could Google it. ""Oh so yall the same hotel but aint got their number thats funny"" Maam I've never heard of this town. We are the same company but at different tiers. ""No it's just funny yall the same hotel and you don't have their number."" It's a different hotel. In a different town. Have a nice day.

Looked it up and the place she was talking about was somewhere above Atlanta, 4 hours away from us. wtf. 

(Yes I could have googled it for her but damn it if i'm up there trying to answer the phone and check people in i'm not gonna do something for a helpless rude lady.)"
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,feyn1vg,t3_eqq2fq,1579447793.0,"we recently had a woman (who i previously thought was so sweet) who was a regular at our hotel bar pay with a counterfeit bill. but the bar was so busy and the hostess marked it with the pen and it didn't show up as fake, so she just gave change and went back to work. so at the end of the night they're counting bank and see that the bill has chinese or japanese characters on it as well!! crazy"
dogs,fdocxue,t1_fdocq2g,1578602879.0,"i’m not sure, so far all our meds and visits have only been $135. i’m not sure if i’d have to go to auburn to get the eye out or if they would do it at my home vet."
dogs,fdocg0b,t1_fdobrtk,1578602643.0,"my roommate told me she wants me to be prepared in case they do have to take her eye out, but i was so paranoid when i first saw it i thought that was what would have to happen anyway. the big thing with that is just the money, but i’ll figure it out if needed."
AskReddit,fczcmlr,t3_ejdlbw,1578098236.0,"not as juicy as the other comments, but here’s mine. 

i had been best friends with a girl since we were both little. grew up together and all of that. after we graduated we sort of drifted apart but were still friends. my cousin (who is my age and my best friend), the girl, and i all ended up going to the same college. after a few semesters my cousin and i decided to rent a house instead of going back to the dorms. the girl persuaded us to let her move in with us, and here is where the story starts. 

1. has not taken any time to potty train her dog that she has had for a year, who proceeds to pee on my bed and my cousin’s rug on a daily basis. 
     a. she would also terrorize my only pet, my beloved cat, to no end. i had set up a spare room to be a “cat room” for mine and my cousins cats with a latch so that the cats could go in but the dog couldn’t just so they could have one spot in the house where they would be safe and unbothered. the girl complained that her dog didn’t have its own room. wtf. 

2. my cousin and i have very difficult majors whereas her major is seen more as a joke. we also had jobs requiring more time and effort than her job. she still would bitch about us never being home because we were always either at school or work. whenever we did come home after being busy all day, we just want to go to sleep before we had to wake up and do it all over again. 

3. she would leave the back door gaped open with nobody home. we haven’t had any big problems but our neighborhood is not the safest. 

4. i was in an abusive relationship with a drug dealer for 2 years, so i told her several time that my number one rule is no weed. she agrees. in about a week i come home to the house smelling like weed because she let her boyfriend smoke it in the house. i come unglued of course, yet she tries to flip it on me because “i should not have told my cousin about it and should have only took it up with her, not my cousin or her boyfriend.” no honey. 

5. [insert about 5-6 other offenses including but not limited to calling me fat, only washing her own dishes that are in the sink, using the bathroom for an hour in the morning so i have to resort to going to my fiancé’s house just to get ready for class, spending all her time in the living room on MY brand new TV i bought and refusing to let me use it if she is watching it when she has her own tv in her room (this got to the point that i would keep the remote with me wherever i went lol), and letting her annoying friend basically move in with us while the girl herself is hardly paying any of her bills on time. (seriously, her friend was here 5 out of 7 nights.]

6. the last straw. i wake up late and rush to school for my HUGE test i had been up until 3am the night before studying for. i had 5 minutes to eat dinner that night and shoved my trash in the garbage can and told myself i would take out the trash in the morning. (it had been much worse before.) on my way to the test i get a text from the girl bitching at me for not taking out the trash. told her i would get it when i got back home because i had overslept for my test since i was up late studying. she proceeded to tell me that she is going to start charging my cousin and i a $120 maid fee. (this is not a joke.) i said ok, you have 2 weeks to get out of my house. 

7. made a big sob story facebook post saying i made her quit her job because she was having to move back home an hour away. sweetie you gonna be commuting an hour to school, you can commute an hour to work too. 


Note - this all happened within the span of less than 2 months."
GiftIdeas,fcumpvl,t3_eiyd2g,1577984318.0,"not sure about pricing, but going to the zoo and aquarium were our best dates. we live in a small town so there isn’t much to do. one day we had a doggy date day and we took our 2 dogs to the local pet store, went to the park to have a picnic, and brought some toys for them to play with there. it was just as fun for us as it was for the dogs i think!"
Dogtraining,fcume1r,t1_fcudts6,1577984125.0,"she is still getting in some of her adult teeth. well they are mostly in but not all of her baby teeth have fallen out before the new ones grow in. i read a while back that pekingese diets should mainly consist of wet food, but i thought there was no way that much wet food could be good for her teeth. she gets one small can per day though. i may see how she likes the kibble mixed with a little water first. thanks!"
Dogtraining,fcu7fa0,t3_eir9t8,1577974342.0,"my dog does the same thing, but she is a small pekingese so i think she is just doing it because her mouth and teeth are so tiny so she only eats 1-2 kibbles at a time. She will get a piece from her bowl, run across the room or to her bed to eat it, then go back and forth. But I see your dog is wayyy bigger lol. maybe try a slow feeder? we got one for our great dane since he was eating too fast but maybe it would spark more interest in the bowl?"
dogs,fclp43z,t3_eho07v,1577753048.0,"my hypothyroidism makes my depression/fatigue/anxiety/all that great stuff worse. my last year in the dorms i got my cat registered as an emotional support animal because i had a lot of stuff going on on top of all that, and it really did help me having her there. knowing that i have to take care of her and get up each day and having her to come home to and cuddle with really helped me feel better. she isn’t too high maintenance though. i also adopted my little pekingese girl in October. i had been wanting a little doggy for a while and had some other drama going on at the time. i got her and of course fell in love all over again. BUT ANYWAY i was just thinking about this because i had a bad day at work today and was just crying and breaking down so once i got home i grabbed my doggy to cuddle and realized i hadn’t really cried like that since i got her. thought that was really cool. 

(i still have my kitty, she is just older and likes to keep to herself more now but we still are cuddley and lovey)"
