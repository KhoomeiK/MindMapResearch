television,fesoml4,t1_fermk1r,1579367462.0,"I forget the name of the Chuck Wendig one I tried to read but did not finish. I read the whole Lords of the Sith book and it was fine but felt kind of inconsequential. I think the thing I loved most about the old EU was that it was building on the story I loved. The X-Wing series was directly connected to Return of the Jedi. It answered questions like ""what happened after they destroyed the death star?""

The following books built on that. Showed them contending with the vestiges of the empire. You knew what kind of Galaxy they wanted to build. But you didn't know how they were going to go about doing that. You saw characters grappling with moral issues and striving to ensure the New Republic didn't become the Empire all over again. You had them fighting against moments where it seemed like that might happen. Luke trained new Jedi. He became a paragon of the light side of the force. He had is struggles, and he had failures. He had students and family fall to the dark side. And you watched it happen.

I read the descriptions of the new stories and it feels like they're isolated. They seem unconnected for the most part with the greater canon, or like they're designed to fill in lore in some way instead of actually building a story. The thing that bothered me the most about TROS is that it almost seems like they're removing Jedi from the galaxy. Rey buries the lightsabers and it seems like she is just going to retire to Tatooine and her story is over and that's really frustrating. The Legends EU had an epic feel to it. Both in its size and themes. We saw characters grow old, fall in love, get married, have children, and their children and others take up the generations long cause to build a better galaxy and defend it from threats. 

I enjoyed the new movies for what they were. I love Star Wars. I even love the prequels. But I have a hard time watching the movies, and looking at the current lineup of books. And seeing how they are ever going to tell a galaxy-spanning epic story that rivals the Legends EU."
television,fepw98k,t1_feptepv,1579333491.0,"I think it's about five years after the battle of Endor. So roughly 29 years after season six of The Clone Wars. IDK her age but if Anakin was her first master and she was 14 at the beginning of the Clone Wars series, and 16 at the end, she'd be 45 in The Mandalorian. Not very old for a Jedi really. Especially considering she seems to have become Jedi Master level, which means her proficiency in The Force would probably have allowed her to slow her aging down if she wanted to focus on that (which she might choose to do depending on her goals). Or her species could be longer lived than humans as well. After all, Baby Yoda is 50."
television,fepv9ib,t1_fepu9md,1579332541.0,The new canon EU novels have been super disappointed for me so far. I was really optimistic and I am still holding out hope they will get their shit straightened out. But I just started re-reading the '90s X-Wing series and god it is so much better than the books I read in the new canon.

In 90% of cases where the employee wins a wage theft lawsuit, they still don't get paid back. It's essentially legal for companies to steal from employees. This theft is perpetrated against the lowest wage, most vulnerable workers. Literally the wealthiest corporations in the world stealing from the poorest people in the workforce. It's disgusting and this just makes it worse.

Fantasy,fdpida3,t1_fdpb5pk,1578629432.0,"Then they should just say ""I don't care. I read what I want."" and stop trying to pretend it's a ton of work or takes a lot of effort. It doesn't. It takes a tiny bit of effort. If people don't care and just want to read new versions of the same stories written by the same kind of people over and over, that's fine.

I love the correspondence leagues on there. They have them for ddk, sdk, and dan levels. Most of them are round robin so you play everybody once or twice. It's always even games, so if you're 18k you can end up against a 10k but that can be good practice. One of the most important things in this game is to embrace losing as part of the experience. It will happen a lot. There is an go proverb that says ""lose your first 100 games as quickly as possible."""
