As best as I can remember it was: about 3 or 4 tablespoons of butter and one medium onion sautéd over medium low with a bit of salt until the onion is staring to brown. I almost always pop the lid on my onions for the first few minutes to let them steam and then lid off for about 5 minutes. Then three cloves of minced garlic and deglaze with a hearty splash of sake. Once it’s mostly gone in goes a small head of shredded cabbage. Mix, mix, mix. Anther hearty splash of Mirin, a three finger pinch of sugar, and miso to taste. I added about 1.5 tablespoons. More enthusiastic mixing and enough water not to cover but about half covered. I’d guess about a cup and a half. Lid on, simmer until soft and silky. Stir and taste occasionally. Maybe 15 minutes more. I took the lid off at the end to get rid of excess moisture. 

It was so good, I had it with salmon but I could have just eaten the cabbage. Salty, sweet, buttery in texture and taste. Yummy. Happy cooking, I hope you enjoy it as much as we did!"

52weeksofcooking,ffk2ld8,t3_etyn4b,1580013871.0,Wow. That looks tops!
whatsthisplant,ffiorep,t1_ffigjmk,1579978972.0,Yeah it’s pretty but unfortunately invasive.
gardening,ffioh9m,t1_ffi0jds,1579978779.0,"Yes!! Same, I read the same suggestion about a year ago and was loving having them available to cook with at a moments notice. I accidentally let a couple go to seed last fall and now I have about 30 little babies!"
AskCulinary,ffikgjo,t1_ffidetv,1579976016.0,"Yup, that’s very similar."
AskCulinary,ffikc64,t1_ffighap,1579975932.0,Oh that sounds yummy! I have definitely had to suffer through macaroni salad with pineapple.
plantclinic,ffi7dao,t1_ffi6qi0,1579967017.0,Yes! I’ve done this with a pot it totally works. Just go slowly. I got the idea from someone here who went to thrift stores for cute mugs and other containers and drilled drainage to make unique inexpensive pots for plant presents.
