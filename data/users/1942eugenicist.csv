askphilosophy,fengvcy,t1_feng8aa,1579284411.0,"There are books about this very concept since the 1800s. I think Benjamin Franklin had the statement that criminals are not fully responsible for their actions, but we need to lock them up still to stop the spread of chaos. 

Robert Sapolsky also goes over no free will and criminals. 

You don't need to feel anything because you are still thinking the world should be a certain way. Granted most people want an idealistic world. 

If you feel bad about it, become a scientist and make the world how you want it. 

A lot of people start feeling less bad the more complicated it is. 


There was a study with the trolley test were you had to choose to kill 1 or 5 people as forced choices. Most people choose only kill 1.

But if the person had to physically kill the person with their own hands, less people choose that option. 

Bottom line, life is complicated.

askphilosophy,feho6zv,t1_fehngs1,1579120525.0,"That's why it's argued that it's about semantics. The idea is if you are as literal as can be, you don't believe in free will. 

People say they used their free will to raise their right hand because it's easier to say in conversation use then to say every process that lead up to that point and describing the micro mechanisms.

You say there is no free will if you believe we aren't responsible for anything in the sense of morals, good or bad related to the idea of judgement of an afterlife. That's why the religious talk about god giving free will. It just makes it easier to psychologically get people to do what you want. 

It's a valid argument for generalities but not precision statements. And that's why the science matters if you care about precision."
askphilosophy,fehloem,t1_fehlad1,1579119071.0,"These are not pop scientists. Believing in God is the same argument with your free will. It causes better psychological well being. Mostly because people also don't understand science and the benefits it provides as a tool.

askphilosophy,fehk4up,t1_fehgcaa,1579118184.0,"In my opinion the free will debate is more controversial than the god debate. It deals with identity, the self, and morals directly. 

Post modernism intertwined with free will would be that it's just better to believe in it because it has a better outcome in an individual's psychological wellbeing. It's post modern because it's not accepting the fact it's still untrue. 

It could be the Same with god. Studies do show believing in god has psychological benefits over non believing. Same with free will. 

The problem is that it's not progressive because it values temporary comfort over the development of truth. No free will does ultimately mean no one is responsible for their actions in the sense of good or bad and morals. We still should put people in jails to stop the chaos from spreading to the rest of society. 

However, as we progress with technology and other research we should look into progressive ideas that pave way to a better conditioned society if your view is a humanitarian one."

Let's take dan dennets stance on free will. He takes a libertarian stance on free will which has been criticized of not having modern understanding of science which goes over how we make decisions and basic mental tasks are much more complicated than what a libertarian free will believer argues. 

Let's take Robert Sapolsky, Sam Harris, lex fridman,Stephen Hawking. 

Philosophers that you named could be considered a social science type of philisopher since they don't study the hard data behind what they speak semantically.
