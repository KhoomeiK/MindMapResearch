AskReddit,ffhzldm,t3_etqf2g,1579960432.0,"2 scenes from animated series. 

First one being Aang talking to the past avatars for guidance on top of the Lion turtle during the last arc of the show. That scene was very powerful to me and still gives me goosebumps.

Second one is when Avatar Wan dies in a battle field and speaks with Raava, the following dialogue is really great especially accompanied by the music:

Wan: I'm sorry, Raava. I failed to bring peace. Even with Vaatu locked away, darkness still surrounds Humanity. There wasn't enough time.

Raava: Don't worry, we will be together for all of your lifetimes, and we will never give up."
