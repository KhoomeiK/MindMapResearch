Correct me if I'm wrong, but this video shows that the DMR's 4th shot no longer just pops shields, but also kills. Whereas before the shields were popped and it required an additional headshot to kill."
halo,fe9r2c4,t1_fe9ntw2,1578940746.0,The thing is many players love having that one weapon that does everything because it makes the game easier. Arena shooters are becoming a thing of the past and it's reflected in how the casual gamers prefer the TU settings. Weapon pickups and map-control are now unnecessary due to the TU.
halo,fe930ep,t1_fe5y9vs,1578933677.0,"Bloom was the method Bungie used to limit the DMR's effectiveness and while not a perfect solution it did work in limiting the DMR's ability to dominate at long range. 343's TU reduced bloom by 15% and introduced bleedthrough on MCC. The DMR now has a faster TTK of 4 shots (instead of 5) and is more accurate too. The TU has buffed the DMR, put it in everyone's hands at the start of the game and is the reason the game now feels stale.

Basically, as much as everyone disliked Bloom it was holding the DMR back from being a monster at range. Couple that with a damage buff and we're in trouble. All of this was done without balancing any other aspect of the game to compensate for these buffs.

I'm not saying the game was perfect before, but it sure as shit was better than it is now."

What you are speaking is nonsense. Why does it matter if the Halo 2 BR was better if I'll never see it in a game of Halo Reach?

I'm convinced you're trolling. There's no way you could actually be making an argument that's this stupid.

And for the record, an individual weapons stats are worthless without the context of the rest of the game. Yes, the Halo 3 BR is better than the DMR, but when you look at how *the rest of the game* is balanced around it you realise it's not OP.
