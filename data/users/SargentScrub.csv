TopMindsOfReddit,fffkqzl,t3_et9j63,1579886081.0,"This gets tricky because on one hand there is a lot of anti-chinese propaganda and thought in the US that makes them seem like the scourge of the world. But yeah some leftists are also notorious for defending anything that China or USSR ever did. The key is understanding that they are just countries, just like the US or any other, and can be looked at from a more objective standpoint."

MMA,fees87m,t1_feebgtm,1579040098.0,"Wow this article is amazing. It honestly predicts a lot about McGregor's behavior after he took out Aldo. He got too confident in himself and then lost to Diaz, and then he had to rethink his fighting style and came out and won again. And then all of that work allowed him to put on a masterclass against Alverez."
fightporn,feawfg4,t1_fea281i,1578952879.0,Bro im not writing Cowboy off i know who he is lol. But you cant be telling me Cowboy is the same level as Conor its just false.
MMA,fe9xlue,t1_fdy24lh,1578942319.0,"Cerrone’s check knee is definitely a high level tool that he’s developed recently, but there is a difference between creating pressure and just advancing. Conor does have multiple entries for the left hand and he doesnt just walk into people’s range, his distance management is top tier and thats why he doesnt get caught that often."
fightporn,fe9vtn2,t1_fe6jm1e,1578941863.0,Dude the person he lost to was fucking Khabib. Everyones acting like he looked like complete shit when thats what Khabib makes everyone look like. He did well enough against him. Conor is still a top tier fighter and even if he isnt as good as he was in ufc205 he can still def beat cerrone. I dont like conor anymore than you do but lets be realistic here

TwoXChromosomes,fdplss9,t3_emid03,1578632221.0,"Hey just taking this from a different angle, i dont have a spouse or SO as im only 18, but a lot of times my parents will seemingly randomly get angry at me for not being more involved in the house and taking on more responsibility, and my usual response is, just like OP said about their husband, that i do everything that they ASK. Of course i know that my parents do so much more to make things work in our lives but whenever they bring up these complaints i feel very confused and unsure of what they expect of me or how to go even go about trying to “become more involved” and its very frustrating. Is there something im doing wrong or missing?"

antiwork,fcs195q,t1_fcry02q,1577909853.0,"Yang is a die hard capitalist. His vision for solving america’s problems is returning to entrepreneurship, as if that will solve everything. His entire logic for the UBI is that people will be incentivized to take more risks, but in actuality the market prices will just increase in response. In any case no poor person is starting a new business off of 1000 a month."

YangForPresidentHQ,fcl0a93,t1_fcklx9c,1577737017.0,"Yang claiming that he wants medicare for all and him simply saying “if we reduce the eligibility age everything will magically fall towards m4a” makes perfect sense but actually just establishing universal healthcare like every other developed country is too good to be true? Who’s the real disingenuous one. And about your other reply to my comment, don’t you find it weird that Yang doesnt have animosity for other plans? If he has such convictions that his approach is correct, why ISNT he and his supporters denouncing other plans?"
YangForPresidentHQ,fckbfav,t1_fcjcz2f,1577721524.0,As soon as these yang libs figure out that real M4A actually makes sense then they just go back to classic screeching tactics about “how will we pay” and “it wont be passed in congress”. Typical.

policydebate,fc322im,t1_fc1z23m,1577379664.0,So basically it means there are multiple neg worlds with different arguments. If your K is conditional it means it is separate to your other args such as DAs and they shouldnt be considered together. If it is unconditional that means it is true across the board with all your neg arguments. Basically you say conditionality when you’re running multiple arguments which argue conflicting things.
