dogs,feem575,t3_eoppoi,1579036546.0,"I have had 2 Huskies and 1 Alaskan Malamute in my lifetime. Huskies are at the top of their class for energy. Going on walks is not work for working breeds like Huskies. Not even a hour long walk. I'm surprised he has not started chewing everything in sight. Working breeds need actual, or simulated, work and that can include brain work. While Huskies are not the smartest dogs they do require some challenge both physically and mentally. Try puzzle toys and be sure the time you normally spend walking is far more physical. (Running, jumping, pulling, walking with a dog vest full of size-appropriate weight, etc.) Even training with hand or verbal signals can be mentally challenging (lol, especially for Huskies!!)."
dogs,fdoug3o,t3_emd2pp,1578613133.0,"This was heartbreaking to read. I have lost multiple dogs in my lifetime, and although I miss them all, a few hit home more than the rest. Decades later I still think of them and feel profoundly grateful to have shared time with them and their very specific personalities. The pain is real and the pain should be explored and not pushed away. Spend some time in the grief and use it to remember the awesomeness Chloe brought to you...all without an agenda.

Well, except for treat time. :-)"
technology,fdnwju6,t3_em8de8,1578594296.0,"Sucks. But also one of the top 5 reasons January 1st was the day I closed my 12 year old FB account. I'm done with it. We may not be able to control large companies actions, but we sure can still control our own."
dogs,fdhtrnb,t1_fdhs8gg,1578430007.0,"That may seem like a common sense solution and in fact it is, with one exception: Being a dog owner, one that views the dog(s) as a family member, negates such tactics or options."
dogs,fdhtfsb,t3_elal0v,1578429846.0,"We had a similar issue with one of our dogs and our solution was to change brands of food until his poop was solid. Now he has to push to get the poop out and viola, no more gland issues. Apparently the pushing out of poop is the natural way they do it and for our little guy, it worked. I hope you find a solution!"
dogs,fdhl0b5,t3_el7kiq,1578424883.0,"I went through a lot of brands, (Hills, to Core, to Blue Buffalo, etc...) I Finally found out about Victors Premium dry dog food. (to keep things a little different I use two flavors: Victor Hi-Pro Plus Formula and Victor Professional Formula), my Doberman finally has solid poop, , excellent coat, no dry flaking and excellent weight control (4 cups a day and she is 75 pounds), and both my dogs love the taste. I buy it from Chewy for the free shipping and good price. 

Hope this helps!"

Why Do Dogs Hump?

Humping, or mounting, is a sexual position for dogs, but  veterinarians who specialize in canine behavior say it often is done for  other reasons as well.

David S. Spiegel, VMD, who has a behavioral veterinary  practice near Swarthmore, Pa., says in unneutered and unspayed dogs  under a year old, humping is usually sexual in nature. But in older dogs  it can be a sign of dominance, a reaction to something that has excited  the dog, like visitors arriving, or a sign that a dog hasn’t been  socialized correctly and doesn’t know appropriate canine behavior.

“The topic draws giggles and laughs, but it’s a very real  topic for some people,” Spiegel says. “Some dogs can become very  compulsive about the behavior.”

Gary Landsberg, DVM, a veterinary behaviorist in Ontario,  Canada, says mounting is common play behavior in puppies, and is even  normal in the play of older dogs if it’s not taken to extremes. “You’ll  often see one dog mount another, then a few minutes later they’ll switch  off and the other dog will mount the first dog,” Landsberg says. “It’s a  common play gesture.”

It’s done by males and females, even by dogs that have been  neutered or spayed, he says. “It’s a play behavior that dogs do because  no one has told them it’s not acceptable,” Landsberg said. “It can  become enjoyable or a normal part of the dog’s day, so it keeps doing  it. It’s the same as jumping up or [barking](https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/guide/understanding-why-dogs-bark) at the door.”"
dogs,fcvfoz7,t3_ej3be6,1578001122.0,"We took our rescue to the PetSmart puppy class where we rescued him. It was a big circle of owners and their dogs. Looking back at that experience, I'd say it's a decent option for first-time dog owners (of course that depends upon the trainer on that given day). But for experienced owners or dogs that are past basic training, I'd pay a local trainer before I'd ever go back there."
AnimalsBeingDerps,fcvau30,t3_ej1hsa,1577998235.0,"Looks like it's been mentioned but yeah, dogs can lose their f-ing minds with these. Not always but even sometimes was enough for me to stop doing it. That said, yeah it's fun to watch! lol"
dogs,fbrdhty,t3_ee6qpd,1577041814.0,"Glad she is home now! Always feels good to have the family members back and safe. Also, just a little side-thought: There are no such breed as a Mini-Doberman. There are Dobermans, and there are completely UN-related Min-Pin's, which a lot of people think are connected to Dobermans somehow (they look similar in their coats) but nothing with the name Mini-Doberman."
