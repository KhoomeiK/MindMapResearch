boardgames,fffq9nk,t1_fffonjg,1579889458.0,Thank you for your reply.  I bought Mechs on a whim and have seen it eviscerated in reviews and opinions.  I was disappointed.   I’ll break it open eventually and try it for myself but needless to say I’m not jumping at the chance to do that.
boardgames,fffnjr1,t1_fffn7jm,1579887788.0,"This is reassuring, thank you for your reply."

marvelchampionslcg,ff974sd,t3_es518j,1579706407.0,"No.  Thematically think of it like this:   Rhino is actively breaking into a storeroom but because of that people have gathered around gawking.  It’s going to take all your efforts to stop one or the other.  You’re either actively stopping him from breaking in by attacking him, OR organizing evacuation efforts.  

This game is quite thematically sound and it’s one of the biggest reasons I love it so much.  It’s really easy to think how the designers were designing.  Some examples:

-Iron mans Rocket boots: discard a mind energy.  To fly takes some mental concentration right?  It’s not an automatic thing, so he has to focus (spend a mental energy) to main the aerial trait.  

Repulsor blast: I spoke of this in another post but he fires his beam (one damage) but needs more oomph in the blast so he draws upon what suit power he has to buff it (subsequent damage).  He draws 5 cards and draws few energy cards (he’s tapped out suit power is minimal) or he finds some reserves (many energy cards) and goes ham.  

These are two off the top of my head, my point is that I love how thematically inclined the game is and often times to reenforce the rules answers it’s easy to think thematically!"

soloboardgaming,ff5psuu,t1_ff58rgn,1579605187.0,Whoa this is a thing?  I loved ASL back in the day.  I need to hunt this down.
tabletopgamedesign,ff3i24k,t3_erg585,1579541487.0,That’s a great feeling!  Congrats to you!!
funny,fezun0o,t1_feyq2xn,1579461873.0,This was almost my exact thought too.
USMC,feyy5og,t3_eqwz5f,1579451895.0,These are poolies aren’t they?  I think DI’s are LITERALLY allowed to kill an actual recruit for something like “What’s up sir?” Lol
marvelchampionslcg,feyxrgh,t3_eqy34l,1579451741.0,"Hi there, I was having a similar experience and was getting frustrated.  I can almost certainly tell you (as it was with me) that something small just needs to click.  Maybe it’s a rule misunderstanding or maybe it’s realizing you can do alter ego actions and then still flip over into hero and do THOSE actions to give you a leg up.   Or maybe it’s as simple as slowing down and saying ok, the damage will come, I need to focus on threat management.  You can thwart with your hero and still do damage via actions and it took me some time to realize what tools. I had at my disposal.   This is one of those games where as long as you have resources to do what you want you probably can do it.  

These are the lessons I learned and I am literally unbeatable on Rhino, standard or expert.  It’s actually too easy and that’s with zero deckbuilding.   Im willing to bet we just need to tweak some of your understanding of the game that’s all.  Stick with it!

Last, if you’re open to playing someone on table top sim (zero shame in that if you own the physical copy) this learning process will happen much fast since your partner can say “Oh, how come you didn’t do ____?” And you’ll be like “Oh I had no idea I could do that!”

Good luck friend!"

gifs,feia0ue,t3_ep5cso,1579133637.0,Why as humans do we react when we hurt another human accidentally by covering our own faces?  Is it just a conditioned shock response?
