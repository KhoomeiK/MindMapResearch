alttpr,ffoubaa,t1_ffoq108,1580081940.0,"Absolutely! If you're looking for some fun/interesting seeds that you'll get through pretty quickly, don't hesitate to check out my Mobile Monday, Welcoming Wednesday, and Saturated Saturday seeds in my Weekly Plando post(Should be on the front page still!)

I'm not trying to advertise or anything(ok maybe a little) but mostly they are great for quicker games! Welcoming Wednesday's are all about new player friendly seeds that won't be too annoying, time consuming, or crazy challenging, Mobile Monday's give you boots and flute really early in the seeds, and Saturated Saturdays are great for those REALLY fast seeds where you will just load up with Go Mode items from the early game! Just all around decent seeds for people that don't have a lot of time to spend gaming!

Of course though, if just Randos are what you're looking for, I fully support that because that's why we're all here to begin with right? :D If that's the case, try creating a custom game where you change the 4 progressive swords to the 4 non progressive ones, and same with armor/gloves/bow. Higher chance of a faster game, but it's not an official setting or anything. I just know that getting an early Golden Sword, Titan's Mitt, and Red Mail can make a big difference early game! :D"

>!You're totally right about people expecting the crazy item checks like catfish or pendant dungeons, and I really should take sequence breaks into consideration...

>!Totally makes sense about Tempered silverless being normal difficulty, it is to me, the only frustrating thing would be if I misstepped and got hit off the edge but that hasn't happened in months to me so that's good.!<

>!Thank you for all of this input, man, I really REALLY appreciate it! This kind of honesty and amazing information is going to be exactly what helps me to create better seeds in the future. I am a Rookie Plando creator, but someday I hope to be one of the great ones!! I'm just happy many people have enjoyed most of what they've seen so far!!<

>!I've got it in the back of my mind now though about execution > item placement when it comes do ""difficulty""!! I'm going to seriously take that into consideration for the rest of my seeds and try to put more focus on harder weekdays into making the execution the harder part!!<"
alttpr,ffjp855,t1_ffjldhm,1580003506.0,">!Great information! I will take this into great consideration when it comes to the difficulty of my seeds from now on! I will try to put more emphasis in the seeds on execution as the difficulty scaling and NOT item placement. What you say does make sense though.!<

>!It's true, anyone that's terrible at the game can still walk from place to place and find items, so raising the difficulty by reducing the number of hearts and gear the player has access to throughout the seed will be the best way to create these ""difficulties""!!!<

>!See this is why I'm glad to have great people like yourself so willing to take the time to explain things and talk about your thoughts on the matter. It's all going to help me become a better Plando creator!! I really hope I can slow you down even more now next Friday! 3 heart, no armor, master sword, silverless Ganon??? Jk! :P!<

>!Sword locations were: Eastern Palace Big Key Chest, Old Man, Mire Shed, Magic Bat... The Magic Bat was actually because of you! I remember you saying, pretty much at this point in the game, who's gonna go to Magic Bat right? No one. So I put Powder in Mimic Cave and Sword4 on Magic Bat with the hopes that people would just never go turn in that Powder and have to do Ganon with Tempered. So that was on purpose since based on what you said in a previous comment, no one would ever go there at that point(and I guess you were right! :D)!<

>!See my thoughts on that were that I knew the player would be in GO mode after unlocking Misery Mire so they might not even check Checkerboard cave where Bow2 was and have to do Ganon Silverless with Tempered(which I've done and it's a bit of a pain but totally doable!)!<"
alttpr,ffjogzz,t1_ffjlr2p,1580002997.0,">!Ah yes, if you read my reply to SCQA's recent comment, I messed up with the flute. There was not supposed to be a flute in TT. There was only supposed to be an ACTIVE flute from Purple Chest. I made it Active to troll people. They would hopefully go to Kak and find out that it was already active now having wasted all that time getting there! :P But the generation was bugging out, so before I found the problem I reloaded the customizer file I had which just didn't have the Inactive flute taken out of the random pool yet and forgot. My bad!!!!<

>!As for the start being easy, yea I feel like most starts are pretty easy in any rando, but I'm still learning how to create better plandos so any advice you can give that might shake things up in that super early game in future Friday seeds would be appreciated!!!<

>!My whole idea was making people(that didn't sequence break) go through most of Escape with the blue cane, and if they didnt check stun kill they wouldn't know about full magic refill. Maybe I should have made it only a small magic refill!!<"

We will see how I feel after a few weeks of doing it, but for now, even if no one plays them, I still had a really great time creating each seed and I also send them to friends who check some of them out that others might not check out!



>!I suppose this seed would be considered Very Hard for newer players that don't know how to sequence break things.!<

>!Had you not sequenced broke(which is totally fine I don't mind when players do that!) the path would have been much less clear and you would not have gotten certain things at certain times. Like, I had intended people to use Blue Cane to make their way through escape(since I saw that on a Standard start race once) which is also why I gave half magic as the stun kill. New players may or may not have remembered to check stun kill and had a harder time dealing damage with the blue cane.!<

>!I do fully agree that it wouldn't be considered a very hard seed for someone as experienced and awesome at Randos as you are, but for other people, I definitely think I took them for a trip. I think anyways, could be wrong. Considering your 1:20ish times on other seeds of mine, I'm actually happy to see your time of 1:58:58 for Friday's seed!! That makes me happy! But I will get better with more time and practice.!<

>!Ah okay, so the Flute situation was just a mistake by me. What I intended was for the ACTIVE version of the flute to be on Purple Chest(I chose the Active version so that players would hopefully go and try to activate it(wasting more time) and find out it's already activated. Just kind of a trolly thing.) So originally I had set it up perfect. I added the Active flute, and I removed the Inactive Flute from the loot list. But then I had a bug where I could not place Glove in Sewers Secret Room(even though the player would have bombs from dark cross and boots from aginah) and before I figured out what was causing the bug, I re-loaded the saved customizer file which I had not yet disabled the Inactive flute in. So I just forgot to Disable that 2nd flute after reloading the customizer settings. My bad!!<

>!So even though you're an incredible player and I think newer players WILL consider this seed Very Hard, I AM still taking what you said into consideration though and I will attempt to make each friday even harder than the last!! I still really do have a LOTTTT to learn about Randomizers, Item Placement, and Routing. I just started doing Randomizers about 6-7 months ago now so I'm not a complete n00b by any means, but I'm extremely far from Andy's level that's for sure! Please, keep this incredible feedback coming!! All of it will just help me to create better seeds as time passes!! Also, don't hesitate to Private Message me some potential ideas or methods that might make my seeds EVEN harder for players like yourself! The more knowledge I get from everyone the better! :D!<

Again though, at least for the next few weeks, I will be doing a seed every day until I potentially get too burnt out from it because I truly do just love doing it. The way I look at it is I'm awake browsing for the last 1-2 hours before I go to bed anyways, so I often take that time to add more and polish the seed I've been working on throughout the day. Generally each seed takes anywhere from 2-5 hours depending on how much thought I'm putting into it and how much research I may decide to do, like on Thursdays seed I wrote out the progression(from the spoilers) of about 13 different seeds just so I could learn some more of the patterns that often come up in seeds! One of the biggest patterns I noticed was that if you got Flippers REALLY early, there was USUALLY something at Waterfall/Zora/Zora's Ledge. So I really also enjoy doing that too! I first started to enjoy reading spoilers, writing down all the items and creating a progression out of it from doing a Spoiler Challenge seed(Which I'm pretty sure is what started me on this path of creating plandos! Then after I made my first Plando, I was hooked! :D"

I knew there was only a few places it could be and I can remember several times in the past getting screwed by not checking Catfish so I took this as an opportunity for new players to keep that in their check list(when needed!)!<

Again, glad you enjoyed the seeds!! Looking forward to many more of your times in the future!"

alttpr,ff8rpod,t1_ff8lxqh,1579693435.0,"Awesome time! I've added both of your times! Again, I can't wait to see more times from you in the future! A solid contender!!!"
alttpr,ff8roq2,t1_ff8h2s6,1579693402.0,"Really happy you enjoyed the seed and can't wait to see more times from you! Of course not every style of seed will be for everyone, but that's totally okay! We can't please everyone all the time right?

>!Yea, the whole Turtle Rock Pendant leading to Bow was one of the first things I decided when creating this seed. That and Hammer from the Ether Tablet. I absolutely crafted this seed with the intention of players never needing to enter EP/PoD until the very end! I did that because so often in the seeds I personally play, I will end up clearing EP/PoD earlier than most other dungeons. I'm trying with these seeds to take people on new and exciting adventures in ways they may not be entirely used to! At the same time, at least for most of this week, I'm trying to offer a very slight sense of comfortability so as not to scare everyone away from coming back on Week 2! It's all a balance I'm still learning and will continue to get better at with time, practice, and much research into Randomizer Logic!!<"

alttpr,ff827av,t3_erojnu,1579664048.0,Was it a typo about your Real Life time being lower than your In Game time? It's tripping me out haha! :D Might try this seed someday not sure. Most of the keysanity runs I do are multiworld!
alttpr,ff7c8po,t1_ff75wc1,1579646170.0,"Awesome! >!Yes it was not meant to be very difficult. The seed I created the day prior was all over the map so I wanted to tone it down a bit.!<

Hope you had a fun time though! =)"
alttpr,ff6zp1r,t1_ff6yvro,1579638202.0,"Haha yea! Honestly, that's something I didn't start doing(excessive searching) until AFTER I had like 3 months under my belt.

I think during my first 3 months I was still not entirely 100% on all the locations and so I wouldn't go to as many of them by mistake and it would end up working out.

Shortly after that, I knew all the locations 100% and I started making terrible routing decisions. ""Oh I'll just go up here and do all these overworld checks even though nothing is pointing to me going up there, because the LAST seed I played had something there and I don't want to get screwed!""

Terrible decision sometimes... I mean it's always going to be a gamble right? But I was doing that kind of thing when I COULD have been clearing a crystal dungeon already and possibly getting an item from that dungeon instead.

So I took a step back and decided I wasn't going to do that anymore. If a crystal dungeon CAN be completed, I do it now, almost always, unless I'm getting a LARGE sum of checks from a different area that doesn't take a crazy long time to traverse!

This is why I fucking love randomizer though!

The seed could be the most straightforward seed for over an hour until your last item is cucked behind a spot you never thought it would be and you can't find it for 15 minutes haha!

As great as the logic can be to us, it can also be the worst! Not everything always points to somewhere. While most of the time the items you get WILL paint a picture of where you need to go, there's a time every now and again where you will be pulling your hair out over one or two single items haha! :D

<3 Randos!"
alttpr,ff6xyoi,t3_erxrx9,1579637187.0,"Awesome work! I remember my first sub 3 hour run and it felt so good! Then my sub 2:30, then my sub 2:00! I haven't hit a 1:30 yet but that's my next goal! Just hoping for a god seed and for my execution to stay decent!

Really awesome job homie! Can't wait to see when you get your Sub 2:30!!!"
alttpr,ff5hoxk,t3_eraw8x,1579593354.0,Tablet Tuesday has been posted! Can't wait to see everyone's time and hear your thoughts!!
alttpr,ff58xzy,t1_ff5868b,1579583781.0,"Absolutely! That's the thing about running different styles every day is you can't please everybody every single time! But maybe one day you will feel adventurous and who knows it might end up being a lot of fun for you(Or not and you'll end up ghosting my post and never doing another Daily Plando of mine again! hahaha jk)

But Great time! Glad you enjoyed getting those early mobility items! Can't wait to see your future times in the Mobile Mondays to come!!"
alttpr,ff58qco,t1_ff55vzd,1579583586.0,I appreciate the kind words! *Hats off*

Thank you much for the kind words! I'm glad you enjoyed the seed. I tried to do exactly what you mentioned and make the routing quite user friendly.

>!The only thing really signposting the shovel was just getting Mitt. It absolutely was NOT signposted, I just know that sometimes I personally, especially if I'm in the area, will do Blacksmith, Peg cave, and Purple Chest after getting Mitt!<

Hope to see more times from you in the future Plando's, take care!"

This was really fun! I had a great time writing everything down the way I wanted and figuring out my route and then playing it! Can't wait until next weeks!

Man I messed up a lot though! Died a handful of times to a few bosses including Ganon. It was a bit rough there for a bit! I feel like I could have had a >!1:30!< time if I performed better but alas, I did not and it really put a dampener on my time! But lessons learned!!"
alttpr,ff4nxf3,t1_ff4mh2i,1579568208.0,Thank you for the kind words! I'm really happy you enjoyed it! I know those feels though of choosing one way over another. That 50/50 chance of it paying off can be thrilling!
alttpr,ff492me,t1_ff3hyrt,1579558206.0,"I took what you said into consideration about how Plandos should feel unique compared to Randos. I fully agree.

I may end up changing Traditional Thursdays to something more unique and exciting! I just don't know yet.

The original idea was Throttled Thursdays where players get a LARGE influx of items either at the start of the seed, the middle, or towards the end.

I wasn't set on that idea originally which is why I changed it to Traditional Thursdays, but I don't want people left feeling like ""This just felt like a normal Rando, there's no point in doing these each Thursday if I can just do a normal rando!""

Mind you, I might make a fan or two who enjoy it, but I have to think of this project as a whole and your point is extremely valid!

I added in the Weekly post that I'm looking for new ideas for Thursdays so maybe someone will comment with a great new idea for it! :D"
alttpr,ff481fd,t1_ff2s8v3,1579557558.0,Just watched you finish up the seed! So happy to see people playing my seeds and getting a kick out of them! GG on your victory and I look forward to your streams in the future!!
alttpr,ff476ta,t1_ff45slp,1579557035.0,Awesome to hear! I'm really glad you had fun with this one! Stay tuned for Tablet Tuesday tomorrow!! There's a JUICY item from each of the Tablets in-game!!! Grats on taking leaderboard spot for now!!
alttpr,ff45nft,t1_ff3hyrt,1579556079.0,"Thank you for the great information!

I watched most of your video of you doing my Plando last night and I gotta say... You cut through my logic like a lightsaber cutting through butter...

>!Even Hookshot Cave Bonk immediately after boots! I don't know if that one is just part of your normal bonk checks or if you went up there because you were attempting to float over to the other islands, but it was a great check nontheless!!!<

I definitely do NOT want to go for Quantity over Quality.

I put a lot of time and thought into every plando I do, about 1-2 hours a night before I release my next one each day. Often times over the last few days I've been working on a few plandos that are taking me several hours to finish and REALLY think about!

I DO have things that bring something different to the table as well! As you said, something to differentiate them from normal randos!! There is a different theme every day of the week which adds something unique to each of those plando's!

For example, Mobile Monday's will always get you started with extremely early boots/flute. Or Frazzled Friday's will have you pulling your hair out with crazy logic or really hard execution. Or even Welcoming Wednesdays where seeds are intentionally made easier for newer players joining the community, to help them learn and progress without feeling overwhelmed!!

I will absolutely take what you said to heart though and work EXTRA hard to make sure that the quality of my plandos is not effected by the QUANTITY of them!!

What exactly is ASM? You mentioned that is what the hook's require to get around a great idea!

Also, I'm totally fine with only appealing to... Hell... Even one person a week! I'm doing my Daily Plando Randos mostly because I just LOVE creating plandos for people to play! It's something have a lot of fun doing!

You can check out my Daily Plando Rando's Week 1 link here: https://www.reddit.com/r/alttpr/comments/eraw8x/mindkontrols_daily_plando_randos_week_1/

There's a different theme every day of the week(except Thursdays which WILL actually feel like normal Randos, mostly for the new players, although I MAY change it up now that you mention people playing Plando's because they are different from normal Randos. Originally I was going to do Throttled Thursday where you would get most of your items either at the start or end of the seed, but that turned into Traditional Thursday where seeds are quite normal feeling. Might revert back to Throttled to keep the seed unique to the Plando!"
