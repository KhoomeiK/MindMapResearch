minimalcatart,ffxfuff,t3_evoaxv,1580324300.0,"I like it! My suggestion is to tone down the colour of the bandana, as I feel it stands out too much against the rest, and sort of 'takes over' in a way (for me, at least). Otherwise, it's a great picture!

Edit to add: You could also maybe go for a bit of a softer pink for the snoot, but that might be personal preference for me."

Whether you check out /r/indiemakeupandmore or do some googling to find a place that offers that. I’m not sure how involved you want your mother to be in this process, but I think also knowing the scent could be beneficial in finding some leads, or ideas!"

ffacj,ffofyyo,t1_ffkvg7i,1580077280.0,It’s okay. Fooled me too. And I can’t help but be slightly jealous of the fact she bought equally expensive pants to replace them. Their actions don’t quite reflect their values. But I suppose having parents that give you money can skew your views in some ways?
ffacj,ffk6cnp,t1_ffhqe0m,1580017329.0,"I feel like, while it may be a bit redundant, we can also add the AE jeans to that as well.

A couple years ago I was at a mall and felt the need to go into the American Eagle store, fully with the intent of buying some of these highly praised jeans! I left with no more jeans than I had before, and with the feeling like there was something wrong with my body. Everyone else praises them to high heavens, so obviously the problem is with me!

Although, if I'm being honest here, a lot of jeans have been making me feel that way lately? I have a pair of A&F jeans (the nemesis?!) that I bought probably too many years ago, and a pair of Rag & Bone jeans that I was blessed with because my upstairs neighbour was purging her wardrobe so she could buy \~ethical\~ fashion. But every time I go out thinking I'd like something different than what I already have I wind up feeling like I must have a weirdly shaped/proportioned body since everything feels/looks so...unflattering. Also, I should apologise for getting off topic and rambly."
