This album Stand Up and Be Counted is pretty good, kind of like an eighties Genesis album with harder guitars, reminds me a little of U.K.'s In the Dead of Night."
progrockmusic,ffmktr3,t3_eu8sj6,1580056012.0,"Magnum have so many great songs that they've made over the years. Their best albums to me are a bit later than this, Chasing the Dragon (1982) and The Eleventh Hour! (1983) but as far as individual songs go, this is the one I keep coming back to. Such a classic."

AskDocs,fcnb452,t3_ei2fu8,1577807815.0,"I am not a doctor, but my brother went through a similar issue. He had, over a series of many, many years, lost all interest in sex (he also suffered from recurring lethargy, anhedonia, and depression). It happened so gradually and over such a long period of time, that he couldn't rememeber when it even started, and began to wonder if he was asexual. 

He ended up getting a hormone test and it found that his testosterone count was extremely low. He was prescribed testosterone injections, and over the course of a month or two, his symptoms completely vanished. Complete 180.

I highly recommend seeing a doctor for a hormone levels test, just to completely rule it out, if anything."
