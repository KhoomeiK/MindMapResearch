maybemaybemaybe,fe6nsx8,t1_fe6lxw3,1578897393.0,">How is a comment's score determined?

>According to the same principles as a submission's score.

>A comment's score is simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. If five users like the comment and three users don't it will have a score of 2. Please note that the vote numbers are not ""real"" numbers, they have been ""fuzzed"" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the comment, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes. The points score is correct, but the vote totals are ""fuzzed"".


I stand corrected, you were right. It may be helpful if you provide evidence to your claims in the future, may prevent an argument sooner."
