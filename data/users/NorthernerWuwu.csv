The reason Tyson was so insanely feared though was, at the time, he just killed people with no regard to any of the boxing protocols if you like. You were supposed to set them up and then hit them with something they couldn't react to or didn't see or whatever. Tyson just stepped up, took whatever you threw on the way in and fucking knocked your ass to the canvass regardless. It wasn't new new but it was something we hadn't really seen from such a young fighter with less than obvious advantages. He wasn't really tall, no great reach, no amazing anything really other than the killer instinct and absurd conditioning (which almost never mattered back then since the fights were so short). Oh, and he could punch through a brick wall.

Tyson was the beginning of the era of where a punch that even if you knew was coming and braced for as well as you could, it might still kill you.
