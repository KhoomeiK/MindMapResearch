The point is that they were pushing for standards compliance.

Non-compliance is how you get shit like three different ""fast charging"" methods for mini-usb that might not work across devices, or stuff like faulty USB cables that could cause damage to devices in the early days of usb-c.

But there's not a container, and this would be an ill-formed statement because ""zeroing memory"" is not a well-defined thing you can do on an arbitrary non-trivial type. Hence the ""pet peeve"" part of my comment above, this is just a mixing and matching of issues.

Back to the C++ question, though, even if we did want something more generic, I'd probably go for something like:

    template<typename T>
    zero(T * p, size_t n) {
      std::fill(p, p+n, T{0});

While I like this particular article, I also have a bit of a pet peeves against these articles that want to accomplish an inherently low level thing (change memory to a value of zero) with high level language concepts. The _real_ answer here in C++ is probably some version of the tricks libraries like OpenCV use a lot of: don't actually do any work at all. Just mark a bit somewhere that says ""hey this is zero now"", or call `swap` with something else, maybe allocated in a brand new page of memory guaranteed to be zero (if you don't need portability beyond that).
