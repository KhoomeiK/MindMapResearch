“No, we (autistics) tend to prefer identity first. Autism is not an accessory we have. We don’t HAVE autism. We ARE AUTISTIC.

Like how you don’t say a black person is “a person with dark skin”. And blind people aren’t “people with blindness”. Autistic is just what we are. And if you have to use person first language to remind yourself we’re still people, that’s on you.”

No. You’re being obtuse by speaking over me and other autistic people. If you’re white, do you also speak for POC?

Shut. Up. And. Listen. It’s not your place to tell me how we are allowed to identify and what we are allowed to prefer."

~~Well yeah because that's how the grammar of English works. We have prepositions instead of postpositions and place adjectives before the noun they modify.

Saying ""my tall cousin"" or ""my blonde cousin"" or ""my British cousin"" doesn't dehumanize them or reduce them to their attributes any more than ""my Deaf cousin"" or ""my autistic cousin.""~~"

Rare breeds would be extinct without reputable breeders and breed preservation. The breeds we love would go extinct, and it would be impossible to find well bred dogs from health tested, temperament tested parents. I want that predictability. I don’t want a puppy from a shelter with genetic aggression and a bad heart."

He said I had kidney stones, gave me herbs, and put dots on my ear to press if it hurt. 

My ex took me to a walk in clinic later and I got antibiotics. They said it was extremely bad and I would have gotten very sick very fast. So thanks for trying to kill me, Mrs. Smith."
