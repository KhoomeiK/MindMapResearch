Or like saying Samsung doesn’t make Galaxy phones because they use Qualcomm SOCs. Or like saying that a local bakery doesn’t actually make cakes because they didn’t mill their own flower or milk their own cows.

Yes Xbox are made with AMD parts. So is PlayStation and the Switch uses nVidia. But Microsoft designed the Xbox around those chips, designed the enclosure, the cooling (they put so much cooling in), the mobo, and all the software. And yea maybe they’re being manufactured at a silicon factory in China. But that’s how all electronics are made basically. 

There’s not really a difference between owning a chip fab overseas and renting time at a chip fab. Every graphics card is essentially made by Taiwan Semiconductors but no one is claiming that MSI or Asus doesn’t make their own chips, because they all implement their own designs there. 

Microsoft designed, made, sold, and supports the Xbox. To say they don’t make their stuff because they buy off the shelf parts is ignorant at best and deliberately trying to push a narrative at worst"

The SD Powerstage you has comes with two Speakon connectors on the back and you'll need to use a Speakon cables. If the cabs you're using can only take 1/4""/6.3mm in, they sell Speakon to 1/4"".

Bass,ff3uude,t1_ff3tz43,1579549343.0,"There is a bass tuned like that. The Fender Bass VI. But that's kind of another beast.  

However, it comes kinda from a historic place. The regular 4 string is tuned EADG like the bottom 4 strings of a guitar. When going to 5 strings, in general bassists were looking to go a bit lower. So they'd do BEAD. Going to 6 strings is usually for adding a bit of high end, but you'd still want that low end. So BEADGC. There are people who tune their five strings EADGB but that's rare compared to BEADG

But in general, when you're getting up into those higher notes, you're going into the range that guitars play. Bass has a specific role to play so extended range Basses are usually designed for that roll."

Bass,fel57st,t1_fel47mh,1579214319.0,"Essentially passive pickups just output the electrical signal generated by the strings vibrating over a magnet. No battery needed. It's how guitars and bass pickups have worked since the first magnetic pickups. There's different designs but they all work in a similar way. The Tone knob on a passive bass normally affects just treble, and is essentially a cut. At 10 it's full treble, and as you go down it cuts treble. 

An active pickup have a preamp built into the bass. It takes the signal generated by the strings vibrating over a magnet, amplifies it, and gives far better tone control. You normally get 2 or 3 tone knobs, that control bass, mids, and treble, and can act as a boost or cut. Active pickups need batteries to work. 

A lot of bassists really like the sound of an active pickup. Some like the sound and simplicity and not needing battery changes of a passive. It's mostly preference at this point what you like."

The weight is a thing tho, and some basses are WAY heavier than others for seemingly no reason.

So no, you don't have to use a pick. I've play in a metal band for 2 years with very fast riffs and the first time I used a pick on a song was last month. 

Picks have a very distinct sound/tone, but they have essentially one sound. If the songs you write need that tone, then yes you'll need to learn pick. But a ton of bassists here can tell you they get by fine without ever using a pick. 

But for pick advice, look for thicker picks. Over 1mm in size. Those I've found best for picking on bass. And pick close to the bridge."

“You don’t need to learn chords 1, 3, 5, etc.” Not only is unhelpful, it doesn’t even give OP a jumping off point. If they googled the numbers, nothing musical would come up."
Bass,fei2aov,t1_fei0mvb,1579128717.0,"Yes but just saying 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 isn’t helpful. That’s just a list of numbers. Someone needs to already understand harmony to know what you mean by that list of numbers. Especially cause almost every time one of those numbers comes up, there’s a modifier. 

“Learn scale degrees and how they relate to the root instead of learning chords” would be better than just listing numbers.

Also, learning the chord itself is still helpful. I know 1, 5, 8 is a power chord consisting of the root, the major 5th, and the octave. But knowing the shape helps me recall it a lot faster than trying to figure the intervals. Knowing chord shapes helps when I’m improvising to just be able to play music not try to figure out harmony on stage. 

Edit: also this is a newbie. Maybe a list of numbers is literally a list of numbers to a newbie"

Bass,fehzspa,t1_fehy5l3,1579127205.0,"Okay. Lets reframe this. What are you trying to accomplish? What do you want to do with the Bass? Are you trying to learn for yourself? Do you want to write original music? Do you want to gig with other musicians? Do you want to play covers? Do you want to be a session musician? What genres do you play? What genres do you want to play?

Depending on that answer is what you should focus on learning. Slapping is great, but its mostly used in funk bass. If you're going to be playing metal, knowing to slap will yield you almost nothing. If you're playing punk, yes play with a pick. That's the sound of punk bass. You also don't really need to groove since you'll be playing essentially 1/8th note roots. If you wanna do Jazz, well you gotta learn how to walk a bass. 

Your original question is if you needed a pick to sound professional. Well, professional doing what. Professional on stage playing rock, maybe. Professional in the studio doing bass for Hip Hop, most definitely not.

What are you trying to get out of bass. Once you know that, you'll know what to focus on."
Bass,fehubfn,t1_fehsh1k,1579124016.0,"Not at all. In fact, up until recently it was SUCH a stereotype that you weren't a ""real bassist"" unless you played with your fingers. Now it seems like people care a lot less.

Picks add a different sound than fingers. There's a stronger attack and the sound is more focused. There's times when that sound is preferred and times when its not. A pick is a tool."
Bass,feht0pj,t1_fec6ufv,1579123285.0,"It is hard. I play bass, guitar, and drums and I don't find one easier than the other (besides catching your breath while drumming). It's hard to sing while playing because it's a lot of multitasking. Now instead of all your focus going to your instrument, you need to be able to keep playing while focusing on your singing. 

It does come with time. My suggestion is practice your singing on its own. Get comfortable with the song and know it back and forth. Then get comfortable with the piece on bass. And when you combine the two, go off muscle memory as much as you can. It's hard, but worth it."
Bass,fehso37,t1_fef5gl0,1579123089.0,"No that's not really a thing. The wattage on amps is what they're rated to handle. So a 500 watt cab can handle a maximum of 500 watts before the speakers burn out. If you pump 5 watts into it, nothing different happens than 500 watts. Impedance is what matters. The idea that the wattage of the cab matters and having a cab with a very high watt rating will hurt your head is essentially a musicians old wives tale."
Bass,fehsgtq,t1_fef42cx,1579122975.0,"Eh, not necessarily. I have a head that runs at 8 and 4 ohms, and when I'm at 8 ohms I have a lower headroom and the amp breaks up sooner.

But it's related to impedance not cab size like /u/oddball_adam is saying."
Bass,fehsd9a,t1_fef144r,1579122920.0,"But that's not how electricity works. A cab made to handle 80 watts at 8 ohms and a cab made to handle 800 watts at 8 ohms both work at 8 ohms. If you have a head that works at 8 ohms, it works at 8 ohms. If you have a 50 watt head and plug it into the 800 watt cab, the head sees the EXACT same thing as if it was plugged into the 80 watt cab. The head will not overload. In fact, if you had an 80 watt 16 ohm cab and a 800 watt 8 ohm cab, the 50 watt head would overload on the 80 watt cab. Because it's about resistance. 

You are right about overdriving heads. My amp is rated for 8 and 4 ohms. It runs at 300 watts on 4 ohms and 175 watts at 8 ohms. When I'm playing into an 8 ohm cab, I have less headroom and get breakup quicker. But this isn't due to the size of the cab, just the impedance. In fact, most ""big cabs"" have LOWER impedences than ""small cabs"" and you'll more than likely get get cleaner sounds with a big cab than not."
Bass,fehrkku,t1_fef2l6e,1579122470.0,"Yes, the amp can have a massive effect on your tone. There are amps that have a reputation as being ""clean amps"" where they don't really color the sound. And then there's amps with a very clear direction that lead to very specific tones. Especially with things like onboard Overdrive. An amp with tube overdrive sounds way different from one w/ solid state drive. 

The speakers/speaker cabs can also affect the tone.

But yea as someone else commented, if you're playing with a drummer you'll want 200ish watts of power."
Bass,fehqxub,t1_fef5eb0,1579122107.0,"Yes they're different. The thing that essentially dictates what sound the string makes is length, thickness, and tension. A longer string will be lower than a shorter string, if thickness and tension are the same. If you're buying strings for a short scale bass or Mikro, the length is shorter. So to get the same E that a full scale bass has, you'd either need thicker strings, or looser strings. If you used regular strings on your short scale, they'd be super loose to get the same tunings. 

I don't know if you'd need special strings for the Mikro. You can probably get away with short scale strings, or someone else here might know. But yes, there is a difference between short and full scale strings."
Bass,fehqk6i,t1_fehn73r,1579121888.0,"I honestly think that thinking of modes relating to a ""base key"" is inhibiting. Like, A Aeolian (minor) being the 6th mode of C is confusing. Yes, technically A Aeolian and C Ionian share the same notes, but because of how the notes are arranged and used they have a very different feel. It's important to understand that the modes came essentially from starting the major scale from a different note, but once you know that don't think about it like that.

Think about each mode by itself, not related to Major. 

Think about it for what the scale does. Aeolian is the minor scale and sounds sad. Lydian feels like a more ambiguous major. Phrygian is like a darker, more dissonant Aeolian. Etc. That's how musicians think about it. 

That's why when someone calls B Mixolydian, you're playing the Mixolydian scale with B as its root. The musician calling that scale isn't thinking of how B Mixolydian relates back to E Major, instead they're thinking ""Mixolydian sounds like a slightly darker Major, that's the tone I want built off of this B""."
Bass,fehpt0v,t3_ep3rsj,1579121455.0,"Hi. I did the drums to bass thing. I actually went both ways, I did bass a while then went to drums, and after drumming a good while I went back to bass and my bass skills were almost at 0. Same reasoning, noise.

Count your blessings, if you were anywhere near a good drummer you have rhythm, and rhythm is so important for bass. Since the instruments go hand in hand, you're in a good spot. 

For Amps, others have suggested the audio interface route. That's fine but you have to have your computer on for that and I personally think you need the least amount of things to get in the way from practicing. You can look into one of the Vox Headphone amps, which just plug into your output jack on your bass and you can connect headphones to. 

If you think you might want to use pedals, or just play without headphones, you cannot go wrong with a Fender Rumble. I think the 25 watt one is a better deal than the 15 watt one but that's up to you."
Bass,fehosm5,t1_fehdsi6,1579120870.0,"This is bad advice. 

1. No, it's not how ""every great musician"" has learned tunes. If that was the case, sheet music wouldn't exist. School bands wouldn't exist. Schools like Berklee wouldn't exist. Everyone learns songs by ear, why have a school to teach music. 

2. It is really hard to ""sit down and learn songs"" without a foundation, either in ear training, or at least learning scales. People who say ""just sit down and listen"" vastly underestimate how much knowing just basic scales can help in learning songs by ear, cause it helps you have an idea of what notes come next.

3. Learning songs by tab is a great way to get familiar with an instrument. Yes, its a paint by numbers approach and ""tabs suck"" and ""tabs are training wheels on music."" But if someone just has an instrument and no teacher, tabs are a good way to just start playing. As you're playing along with tabs, because you're not worried about playing the wrong note, you can focus on your hands, placement of fingers, etc. 

I do think learning by ear is a vital skill. But it's one that I think shouldn't be preached as gospel."
Bass,fehobbv,t3_ep5jnl,1579120595.0,"Here's the thing about practice. You need to find what works for you. Some people can sit down, do scales, chords, modes, etc., for an hour. Just going up and down scales. I absolutely CANNOT. I get bored after 5 minutes. I've been able to make myself for like 15 minutes but I cant any longer. I have a bit of ADD so it just doesn't work for me. 

So the best practice I've found FOR ME is make a playlist of songs I know how to play and want to learn. I play the playlist on my Echo and go along. If I don't know the song, I pull up a tab or try and learn by ear. When I get tired of learning the song, i go to the next one on my playlist. I know I'll come across the song again next time I practice and by then I can build on what I learned before. 

That might not work for you. You need to find how you practice best.

Okay, now that thats done, for the rest of your questions.

No you don't need to learn chords. You can, but the purpose of learning chords for bass is slightly different. Most music, you don't ever play chords on bass. It doesn't sound as good as on guitar and doesn't fill the roll of the bass. But, if a Guitarist is playing, say, an A7 chord, if you know how chords work you'll know what notes to play under that chord to be in key and fill the bottom end. 

Making a ""groovy"" bass line comes down to practice and taste. What do you think is groovy. Do you love Funk and like that really powerful funky bass tone. Do you like metal and dig that in the pocket strong slightly dirty bass sound. Do you like the blues. It's up to taste. But as you learn songs, you'll start to pick up on techniques other musicians use and you can start incorporating that into your music. Don't try to reinvent music. Learn from people who came before you. Find the style of playing you like, listen to musicians who play that style, and start learning their songs. 

I think it's understated how important it is to learn songs when learning an instrument. Everyone focuses on learning the notes and learning scales. But all that musical knowledge is kinda wasted if you don't *play music*. So just play music. Actively learn songs. As you're learning songs, you might come across a bass riff and realize ""This basically just walks up the minor scale but in a jagged way"" or ""this riff is mostly just the I and V of different chords"". Learn from the music you play."

Where I have felt moments where things clicked is with some effects or times when I've learned a song by ear and done it fairly quickly. With effects, I remember picking up a good Overdrive pedal, plugging in and dialing tone, and realizing ""oh, this is some nice sounds"" and being able to create the sounds I only heard in my head. 

The other gear one was I just got a Mooer GE150, and while it's gotten some coverage on the guitar side it has none on the bass side. So i created some presets, plugged in, and out of nowhere my bass sounds more clean. More defined. The Compressor and Noise gates on that thing are so good, and my playing was way more defined. It didn't make me a better player. If anything it highlighted where my weaknesses were, which were kinda hidden by my previous, more muddy pedalboard.

If you're doing new, I'd recommend looking at the range above their lowest cost basses to get yourself something that lasts. If you're okay going used, make sure you get to try the bass and it feels like something you'd never want to put down.

For amps, if you want to Gig you will need a more powerful amp. Probably a Fender Rumble 200 minimum. In my opinion the Rumble 25 would be a good practice amp. Also, if you like the idea of Head and Cab separately, TC Electronics has some killer super budget friendly amp heads. You can pair those with the TC Mini Cabs, or with something like the Rumble 2x10 or 1x15 cab."

AmItheAsshole,fdihr4j,t1_fdifzmx,1578443195.0,"I’m saying this as someone who had a collection (mind you $2-3kish not 40k) who sold cards both to players at value and to stores at a loss. All these points are valid. But the big thing with Magic is that most game stores have weekly tournaments. This is mostly for Standard staples but goes for Modern or Legacy if your local store hosts them, but you’ll usually find someone willing to buy a few cards at market price weekly. Of course cards aren’t fungible assets. I never said they were. I’m just saying the evaluation of the cards is pretty close to exactly the value you’d get selling player to player. And depending on the store you sell them to, most buy lists are fairly generous and will buy cards in bulk for 50-60% of their market value.

And again it matters how old the card and if it’s in “Standard” which is the past two years of cards. And if the card sees tournament play. A “Standard Staple” is super liquid and if you’re trying to sell rare lands or an in demand card, you’ll be able to get rid of it for market value in hours. If it’s a “modern” (cards printed from 2003 to now) staple, it might take a few weeks to get rid of, but you will get close to market value. Legacy or Vintage cards (cards older than 2003ish) it could take months to flip. Of course, if the card isn’t a staple, if it only has value for being rare or is a casual favorite but doesn’t see tournament play, you will be holding onto it forever.

But yea if you go to an online vendor like Starcitygames, they have a “buy list” will prices for essentially every card, and they’ll just pay cash for them."
AmItheAsshole,fdidn9h,t1_fdibxff,1578440526.0,"Magic is odd. Yes most collectibles, if you receive a catalog that says they're worth X they're actually worth X - Y%. However, with Magic specifically, these cards ARE used to play with. And they're bought/sold/traded at very high frequency. So if I look up, say, Scalding Tarn, the average price is about $60-70. If I tried to sell it to a person, I could easily expect $60 or $60 worth in cards. If you want to sell your whole collection to a store, you'd probably expect about 50-60% of the value, but if you sell by yourself you can actually expect to see most of the value returned. 

And this of course varies. If they're cards in standard you can expect their value to be spot on. If they're legacy there's wiggle room. And if they're rare and highly valueable, like Power, they could actually be worth significantly more than the median price.

But yea, unlike other collectibles, Magic really does hold its value. Because the cards aren't just nice to look at things like coins, but actively used in tournaments."

YTA YOURE A TOTAL FUCKING ASSHOLE

You are so fucking hypocritical you can't even see it.

>I’m frustrated because the function and aesthetic of a purse could be met for as little as a $20.

How is this different from Magic. A piece of cardstock worth pennies with Steam Vents printed on it has the same function and aesthetics of a real Steam Vents that costs you $15 on the secondhand market. Now you mention you have a $40k Magic collection. That sounds like you have some Power in there. Do you play with your Power? Or do you just have a binder full of them doing nothing. How can you sit on your high horse and say $400 is a lot for a purse when you have pieces of cardboard worth hundreds or thousands.

And also, just like Magic has a secondary market, purses do too. A designer purse purchased from a seasonal collection can double or triple in price, maybe more. You should get this you're obviously into Magic Finances. Purses work the same way.

Also, if you're gonna go utilitarian, a $30 Walmart purse will fall apart in 6 months. You said your wife's old purse lasted a few years. Lets say 3. A $400 purse, spread over 3 years, ends up being $12/mo. WAY less than your $300/mo Magic budget.

If you're having money issues, cut back on your Magic budget. I played as a college kid. I played with a maybe $20 budget a month. YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE SPENDING $300 A MONTH ON MAGIC, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE MAKING A BIG DEAL ABOUT YOUR FINANCES! You have a huge collection. Trade. Sell. Move cards around. If you really need a new Modern deck every 3-4 months, trade your fucking cards. But don't make your wife feel bad about a purchase she wants to make once when you spend that amount of money monthly."

TRY THIS BASS IN STORES! 

I recently went to Guitar Center to try out this exact bass. They had two on display there. One of them had such a horrible fret job that in the less than 5 minutes I used it my hand looks like it lost a fight with a notebook. Shallow papercut like cuts all over my left hand. 

The second bass I tried I ended up playing for like 20 minutes in the store and I would have walked out with it that second if I had the money available. In fact, I told my gf to not let me go back to Guitar Center cause if I do I'm walking out with that bass. Both were SR305s, both sounded identical.

If you're looking for tone shaping but don't want to put down mortgage on some SansAmps, get the Behringer BDI21. It's an essentially $30 clone of a SansAmp.

In your example of Em, it's in E minor, so you would choose a minor or blues scale. You can start on the E, and choose notes from that scale. Any note from that scale will be more or less in tune.

The Fender Rumble is essentially the go to bass amp series. They’re solidly built, high quality, and sound amazing. Plus the Rumble comes with a 8” speaker which should sound better and more full than the 2 5” speakers in the Vox. The extra 5 watts won’t do much in terms of volume but will add a lot of headroom. 

If you have a chance to go into a music store to play both, play both. The Vox sounds a lot cheaper than the Fender and if it comes down to it, it’s better to have the amp you can afford than no amp at all. But I’d personally try and save for the Fender."

Yes [insert prog drummer here] is a better drummer than Ringo, but that kind of busy playing wouldn't serve the music the Beatles were putting out.
