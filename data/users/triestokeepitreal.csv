crafting,fdyo8fb,t1_fdylmiv,1578781870.0,"You'll need to scout a couple of boutiques. Look for gifts, clothing, or handmade items being sold. Go in person, if you're comfortable with that. Take a small selection of your artwork. 
Ask the clerk or owner if the store takes consignments.  
As a rule of thumb, the store will take a % if each sale. You'll want to factor in that to your pricing. 
The benefit to the store is that the only financial risk they take is the value of the display. But you've already spent $ making so you have nothing to lose and so much to gain. 
You'll see how others respond to your art, make money, and most importantly feel so good about yourself! 
I hope this is useful and would love to read updates from you. I used to run a store where these would have been a hit. I would have taken you as a retail partner (consigner) immediately!"
