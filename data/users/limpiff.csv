todayilearned,ffmc61x,t3_eu5wt2,1580052230.0,My office switched to this concept a few years back because “if it’s good enough for Google it’s good enough for all”....... half of the talent I respect and appreciate have already left us. They were all introverts who hated the new space. Not good.

NBA2k,ffhb12k,t1_ffh6sbb,1579928417.0,Dude he is awful his regular card is faster. Something is wrong.
