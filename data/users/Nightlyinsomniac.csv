My600lbLife,ffdop2p,t1_ffcwbsv,1579825370.0,"My husband laughed at the scale part. 

I’m with you on the Tammy needs to fail part. She doesn’t seem to have any goals that would make her at least attempt to follow the plans for surgery. Amy has a goal that can become possible if she follows the plan. 

I think what Tammy needs is a big dose of adulting. I think being on her own and having to get up and do everything for herself would hopefully show her that she needs to drop the weight. 

She said she can’t “walk with her walker and hold a drink” i’m pretty sure that is the universe telling you to unfuck some things in your life."

My600lbLife,feh8koj,t3_ep1r3a,1579111380.0,Ok I finished the episode. As someone who has the sleeve all I can say is WTF.  I’m kinda impressed but mostly disgusted that she was able to gain in her first months. I could not stand food after surgery and it was a struggle to eat a meal.

My600lbLife,fdni7yx,t1_fdne753,1578586345.0,Welcome. I had the sleeve surgery back in October 2017. So it shocks me that she did that.
My600lbLife,fdmet9o,t1_fdmbveu,1578547548.0,Dr. Now said she had eaten it back to ginormous size again.  So he had to give her the sleeve all over again.
