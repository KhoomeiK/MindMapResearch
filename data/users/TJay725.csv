catsbeingbanks,fdlbke3,t1_fdl9vme,1578520528.0,"This must also be the only time you've seen some defend a stranger that cross posted a cat gif, as three sentences is not a lot of sentences. You know, the average amount of words we say in a lifetime is around 860,341,500. If, on average, 15 words go into each sentence, you will have said 57,356,100 words in your lifetime. Now, take into account, this is only the average. People who die at before 18 months old usually don't say any words. So, you might actually say around 900,000,000 words in your lifetime, which would bring the average amount of sentences up to 60,000,000. This is a big increase if you think about it (around 4.6%). So, 3 sentences is really nothing. 3 is 0.000005% of your lifetime 60,000,000 sentences, which makes a very minute impact. So are these 3 sentences a lot? Sometimes. If you've never said a sentence before, 3 sentences are an infinite amount more sentences than you have ever said. If you've only ever said one sentence, 3 sentences are 3 times the amount you've said in your life. It gets a little bit tricky if you've only ever said two sentences, as this makes 3 sentences 1.5 times the amount you've said in your life. Now you're probably wondering, what is half a sentence? You can't have half a sentence, as when you try to have half of a sentence, it turns into a whole sentence, right? Wrong. Think of a half sentence as more of an incomplete sentence, where if you had another half to the sentence, it would make sense, but since you only have the first half, if it was published, it would make no cents. Now, back onto track with the 3 sentences out of 60 million sentences thing. That doesn't matter at all, because you don't say the sentences, you type them."
