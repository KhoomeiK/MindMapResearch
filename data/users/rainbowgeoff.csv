news,fdrzktv,t1_fdrz407,1578692088.0,"But that's my whole point. It's a fact inquiry. It's not something you can just say ""avalanches happen on ski resorts, it's a known risk, so you can't sue."" If there was evidence of recklessness or gross negligence on the part of the resort, such as not closing a slope or making a good faith effort to ensure there was no one on the slope, before they went forward with a controlled avalanche and it caused injury, then they can absolutely be sued for that.

I'd be shocked to see if there was a state where that wasn't the case. Again, if they can be sued for not giving notice that the snow is patchy or operating a chairlift negligently, then I don't see a carve out for forced avalanches. That's a part of maintaining the slopes."
news,fdrypw5,t1_fdrskex,1578691757.0,"Correct, but they're still not granted per se exemptions from *all* types of negligence. Gross negligence can still result in liability. Intentional acts that cause harm can still result in being sued. They can be sued successfully for negligible operation of chairlifts, not maintaining their slopes, patrol guides who recklessly crash into another skier, etc.

Why would they not be held liable if they conducted a controlled avalanche recklessly? 

Again, these ski statutes do not grant per se exemptions from suit. They're not granted blanket immunity for anything that happens on a ski slope. Their own negligence in the operation/maintenance of equipment, notice, or reckless behavior can result in liability. 

Here's a case where the resort was held liable for failure to warn, an ordinary tort doctrine, and a counter-case:

*Sytner v. State*, 223 A.D.2d 140 (N.Y. App. Div. 1996) = common law duty to warn of dangerous conditions not abolished by N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law § 18 (ski law) = plaintiff had skied over a large patch of ice that was not properly marked by the resort. *But see Hyland v State*, 300 A.D.2d 794 (N.Y. App. Div. 2002) = defendant not liable where plaintiff was warned that slope conditions for that day included the possibility of bare patches when plaintiff was injured after hitting such a patch.

Here's an ALR article on the subject, and a quote therein. The ALR is just a collection of cases and doctrine from various jurisdictions:

>Except for the fact that participants assume perhaps more hazardous risks, the ordinary rules of negligence law apply to cases involving downhill winter sports facilities. Various legal relationships may exist, as invitor-invitee, innkeeper-guest, or carrier-passenger, with concordant duties arising therefrom.

Anything which goes ""beyond the ordinary hazards of the sport"" can be sued over successfully. 

>The precise degree of care required of an operator of a winter sports facility depends on the facts of a given situation, but in the classic case of an injury suffered by the paying user of the defendant's facility, the injured party may be held to be an invitee and the defendant required to exercise ordinary care, both with respect to the maintenance of the facility and the giving of warning of possible dangers

Another quote:

>In *Morse v State* (1941) 262 App Div 324, 29 NYS2d 34, app dismd 287 NY 666, 39 NE2d 288, the claimant was struck by a sled ridden by some young men. She was a beginner and was skiing on a novice slope at a New York state park. There was a sled run adjacent to the novice slope with a mound of earth separating the sled run and the ski slope, but extending only part-way down. Below the earth mound there was no barrier to keep sledders and skiers apart. At the time of the accident many people were present, and both the ski slope and the sled run were in active use. Pointing out that claimant was where the state invited and directed her to be, the court said that she might properly believe that she would be safe and could practice skiing without being subjected to additional hazards, and that while there was a certain amount of danger in the sport, the risk of being struck by a speeding sled was not a part of it. The judgment denying liability was reversed.

Another, this one regarding the acts of other skiers:

>Although an individual who participates in downhill skiing assumes the usual risks inherent in that activity, including the risk of personal injury caused by other persons using the facilities, another skier's negligence, or reckless or intentional conduct, is not within the range of risks that are assumed. McKinney's General Obligations Law § 18-101(1). *Duncan v. Kelly*, 249 A.D.2d 802, 671 N.Y.S.2d 841 (3d Dep't 1998).

Another:

>Patron did not, as matter of law, assume risk of icy and dangerous course or act with contributory negligence in driving snowmobile which tipped over, causing him severe injuries, where he told employee prior to his taking the wheel that he had no previous experience with snowmobiles. *Watson v. Zanotti Motor Co*., 219 Pa. Super. 96, 280 A.2d 670 (1971)."
news,fdrgm51,t1_fdrd8ny,1578684210.0,"Depends on the state. Some states have carve outs in their laws, whether statutory or common law, that excerpts things as being unable to indemnify or be subject to an exculpatory clause.  For example, some courts won't let you exempt yourself from willful harm inflicted on another, or gross negligence. 

Here's a quote from a treatise on NY tort law regarding negligence:

> A party who obtains immunity from liability for ordinary negligence by virtue of a contract with the plaintiff may nevertheless be held liable for gross negligence. Exculpatory clauses are to be distinguished from indemnity contracts: the latter shift the source of compensation without restricting the injured party’s ability to recover. Indemnification agreements are unenforceable as violating public policy if they purport to indemnify a party for damages flowing from the intentional causation of injury by that party.

> Willful misconduct has been defined as an intentional act or failure to act with knowledge that the conduct is likely to result in injury or damage, or acting so recklessly as to indicate a full disregard for the consequences of the action or inaction.
