bitch i felt like i was healthy and normal when my depression was at its lowest (highest? lmao. lowest for mood, highest for depression level) and i was intentionally taking 3x my recommended dose every night so i wouldnt wake up.

i feel healthy when i watch someone take an elevator but i use the stairs and dont get winded. that dont mean i'm not sedentary af.

i feel healthy when i put my contacts in and can see-- that doesnt change the fact that i have retinal scarring and my vision is at 20/100 lmao.

sometimes you can start out honest with good intentions but then end up one of the big ass fake influencers."

AskReddit,feh4thb,t3_ep4u3f,1579109158.0,"9/10 avengers plots.

shit, the accords from CA:CW was interesting af. its a huge moral dilemma. over 80 some countries around the globe wanted some type of restrictions/assurances on those with superpowers since Tony Stark became iron man. and instead of diving into the intricacies of being human and whether the accords was discriminatory or whether 80-plus countries had a basis for a 100+ page document, we just got Cap w/ ""but muh freedom"". which honestly was the worst.

iron man 3 & antman 2 brought up, again, how those with superpowers often dont regulate themselves && end up causing huge amounts of destruction to cities, people, etc. early on, the hulk was hunted bc he broke harlem- but post-loki, its fine if we just drop countries out of the sky or accidentally cause huge amounts of property damage that 8/10 of the avengers cant pay back. not to mention the amount of innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. that shit could have been so damn good if they explored it.

then ofc, there's the snap. like, we got three seconds of how it affected the globe. i mean- literally half the population disappeared, people adjusted, and then they reappeared. and we get zero of that interesting story??? seriously? instead we get a fucking shitty twilight level good v bad fight.

the MCU had so many hints where they could be more than the C-level shit that it is. they could have gone deep and explored how these crises affect the heroes (who are just normal people) and the repercussions of being a hero who, while heroing, inevitably causes large amounts of damage.

not to mention the areas they could go to on characters. fucking Falcon, in CW, he was part of the reason Rhodey fell out of the sky and almost died. Falcon, the guy who originally lost his partner almost the exact same way. and you're telling me all we get is a 'sup?' when they see each other again?

we could have went into wanda/vision. bc vision is a byproduct of equal parts Tony, Bruce, Jarvis, and the Mindstone-- and wanda's entire powers were given to her via the Mindstone. you really want me to believe that wanda/vision is a forreal thing and not just a byproduct of alien sorcery?

we could delve into wanda herself. she asked for these powers to destroy tony stark-- but then she never learned to control them. and she was outraged at being 'locked up' by tony bc her powers are unstable. we could have watched wanda progress from teenage angst into a mature woman who understands great power/great responsibility.

my personal preference for therapists is someone who doesnt coddle me (bc i can do enough of that myself), someone who is honest and tells it how it is. i'm thankful that with my current guy i'm able to deep dive honestly and know that his responses will be logical and be able to 'break through' my own bullshit.

it wanted me to think i was safe-- that i was fit and healthy, the ""average"". it waited while i revelled in my stability. it turns out that my celebrations were premature.

just after i had declared my war won- to be able to eat joyously again, without fear of my body holding onto its calories- something odd happened during my monthly weigh in.

how could this be? at last months check those twenty pounds werent there! had the body released its famed, but never seen, genetic bomb to disrupt all peace and harmony? those twenty pounds were added overnight. 

i had to act quickly. it wasnt safe to let my body have another attack in- i needed to force another stalemate.

i knew there was only one thing that could frighten the body enough to put us back into our previous routine- a calorie deficit.

thankfully the deficit didnt last long. the body and i created a treaty... but still, each of us lies in wait for the other to slip. should one of us falter, the other shall be ready to strike.

... is that what im reading?

does this person just desperately desire to 'fade' into the background the way the 'average' body can? but doesnt want to put in the work to become average and fadeable? but then also, the average has too many privileges that the majority doesnt?

like. idek.

logically, we should all strive for that healthy middle ground in life, whether its with food or work or fun or whatever. and achieving that healthy middle ground comes with benefits. but its work to stay at that middle ground. like fucking hard work.

at my highest weight of 180lbs i wore size 14- and fuck it as the average. i was 'thick' and so fucking ashamed of myself in my own skin. and going to the doctors and getting weighed and seeing that i was that high weight just barely below obesity? that woke me the fuck up.

call out BMI all you want- bc yes, it was invented in a similar fashion to the G Factor, as a way to convert numbers to data and try to find a healthy medium. neither BMI nor IQ (g-factors follow up) are perfect at all. but they are one of many TOOLS used to help sus out if there could be something wrong. but, you dont just use one. you take that data with a grain of salt and use different tools. and then take the collective data and average it out.

BMI = not great data (not terrible but error prone at times)
BMI + food logs + exercise logs + calipers = pretty fucking accurate"

AskReddit,fdrkq4i,t1_fdrj5so,1578685841.0,"again, i think it would depend.

while their personality may not inherently change, theres always the chance that it could. theres always the chance of the partner transitioning to their gender && me losing attraction to them, or them to me. while at the core they're the same person, in a lot of small ways they change.

superficial things like clothing dont bother me, but if my significant other asked me to help them with those superficial things (like shopping for clothes or some shit) i might be a bit uncomfortable. probably nothing too extreme tho.

if my significant other wanted to explore facets of their identity in different ways (i.e. my friend realized he loved dick and asked me to take him to a gay bar) i would be down for it.

but, again, its a very situational thing. who's to say that the other facets the s/o explores wouldnt lead to personality changes? (i.e. same above friend ended up becoming an alcoholic gossip. before he realized his sexual orientation he was straight laced and almost... boring [idek if thats the right word for it])"
AskReddit,fdrigrf,t3_emvte7,1578685025.0,"while being trans isnt a huge deal, keeping the fact that you are either: questioning or know that you are trans- from your partner is a huge fucking deal.

like damn, if i was married and my partner came out and said they were trans and i had zero ideas about it? i would feel so hurt and betrayed. i would start to doubt any and everything that they said previously bc they couldnt trust to tell me what/how they were thinking/feeling for however long.

it would really erode a lot of the trust that we had built in our marriage.

that doesnt mean that we couldnt work through it, but... it'd be really hard to trust that person again.

ofc, thats for a long term committed thing.

if it was dating i'd be less likely to work it out.

disclousre is a huge thing for me in relationships (like, spill all my bullshit by the third date lmao) and i expect that to be a two-way street. if i was dating someone who told me they figured out they were trans, i'd immediately start wondering why they didnt tell me they were having the thoughts/feelings they were having. in the end, not having full disclosure would lead me to think i couldnt trust them. and then i'd probs leave.


but tbf im decently fucked up lmao.

it wouldnt be about gender for me (altho it may be, if i decided to stay and then lost interest/attraction) it would be about my significant other not disclosing a part of their life with me. like a huge part. and im not cool with that lmao."
AskReddit,fdoeaf9,t3_emfo8u,1578603523.0,"this is such a hard question.

its dependent on what type of disability, current (and future) financial status, status of my/our household.

currently, i would abort. i am in no position to raise a child with a disability, nor give him/her the quality of life they deserve.

i have a friend who was born with sma (spinal muscular atrophy). she has had years of doctors, bills, and hardships. at 21 she has tried to kill herself over four times. she wasnt 'supposed' to live passed 6. she still goes in for multiple surgeries. she is incapacitated to the point where she needs a carer to use the restroom and shower. she doesnt know how long she has left to live- and it impacts her quality of life tremendously. she should start college classes? does she have time with all her doctors visits? does she have money with all her bills? would it even matter-- she wont be able to get a job, she cant work a 40hr week-- and her situation keeps deteriorating.

its hard question. if i knew my child had sma, i would abort bc there is no feasible way i can provide a good life for them without sacrificing a good life for myself and my partner.

and ofc, mental disabilities are so different from physical. and disabilities are always 'spectrumized'. my friend may have a very bad version of sma (idk honestly) but someone else may have a 'good' version and live to their 60s with less hardships."

breakingbad,fdevh79,t3_el0uri,1578347447.0,"i think that Walt was angry that Mike could see him so clearly. Mike always knew that Walt's pride and ego could/would ruin the operation they were running.

when Mike originally pointed that out, Walt felt slighted. later in the series he kills Mike out of emotion, not logic. Walt killed Mike bc he was angry that Mike thought he was prideful, he felt scorned that Mike felt that way about him (&& felt it deeply enough he tried to warn others about it), he was resentful of Mike's relationship with Jesse (bc it was one of the only relationships Jesse had that could rival his with Walt) and the ways that Mike helped Jesse (i.e. keeping his conscience, trying to get him out, etc.).

fatlogic,fdbfsvy,t1_fdapg16,1578256964.0,"its such a tough grey area.

contemplating suicide could mean anything from saying ""ugh this days fucking sucks, kill me."" to ""i hate myself and don't want to be like this anymore and want this to end."" to ""i would rather slit my wrists than go outside."" to ""i am so unhappy that i would prefer being dead because it is easier than waking up each day.""

in the current day and age dark 'jokes' are decently normal. does that mean that everyone who says one pertaining to suicide wishes to commit suicide? probably not. in a similar way that early 2000s vernacular was harsh using words like 'retarded' and 'gay' to express displeasure-- did everyone believe that people who were queer or with mental disabilities were bad/negative? probably not.

we've gotten to a point in culture and language where it is normal to exaggerate any and everything, i.e. 'spent my life starving myself'.

it really fucking sucks because this colloquial norm of exaggerating makes it hard to know if someone's words are what they mean.

if we go out and say that someone has a dark sense of humor and regularly jokes about killing themselves, we may be glossing over a potential problem they have-- however if we worry that every person who has large claims like starving themselves or 'rather dead than fat' is true in their claims we may end up wasting resources and energy trying to help someone who doesn't need or want it.

and then, ignoring our new norm of grand claims and dark humor, social media's also produced other areas like 'sad-fishing' (where people post sad content to their friends/family/followers for a variety of reasons). and each person who 'sad-fishes' has a different motive. some want attention or validation or compassion. similarly to when someone 'calls out' another-- they look for validation or arguments or attention as well.

with that in mind, should we give someone who 'sad-fishes' our attention? should we victimize them as well? are they truly 'fishing' or are they depressed? or are they just exaggerating? how can any of us know?"
StLouis,fc4caeu,t3_edukmk,1577412522.0,"i think im missing something.

is yelling at someone to pull up their pants racist now? like, i get that with context it has a chance to be, but your context, unfortunately, is limited by your thoughts/experiences on the event.

you mentioned that you think this event was a coded racially charged hateful message-- but i don't see why that was your immediate thought.

yes, for one man driving in a truck to yell, ""pull up your fucking pants"" out a window towards the only 2 people on the street is suspicious & gives the theory weight.

but there a million other reasons someone could yell that out a window.

- car guy thought one of you was a friend he knew and yelled out the window bc its some weird inside joke. (this is an odd example but as a teenager this was legit the stuff me and my friends did.)
- someones pants were casually slipping down
- some kind of shitty song lyric (bc 'pants on the ground' was a legit thing)
- he was yelling at someone on the phone
- someone he was facetiming just showed his dick && he was uncomfortable with that
- he could have been in withdrawal from drugs & was irritated at any possible slght. people are cunts when detoxing.

idk. obviously, its easy to assume that the pants comment was directed towards you or the other person on the street-- and then even easier to assume that sagging pants comment + poc = racist intent, but unfortunately thats not something that anyone (but the yeller) can know for sure.

idk. i wasnt there & i dont have the tonal context (or any insight into truck man or the other walker) so legit he may have had a kkk sticker on the back of his truck that i dont know about-- but this incident, while shitty (but also, unfortunately, decently normal-- and not the worst thing to be yelled out a car window to people walking on the street) doesnt seem that harmful."

the divide btwn extremes is so harsh-  normal diverse things like opinions end up leading to hateful blows btwn extremes. we're at a point where if you dont agree with 'x' then you are automatically against 'x' (and therefore wrong in the eyes of those who believe in 'x') and are recategorized into agreeing with 'y' with or without your consent.

its so strange that areas like opinions can be interpreted so harshly by different people.

interpreting thoughts can be its own form of ridiculous. in tons of ways the mental gymnastics are so double-edged. we dont want shit from our social media that shows us partying or drunk or engaging in less than workplace behavior to influence our standing in the workplace.

but we let other peoples opinions on their social media (without proof that the person voices those opinions at the job/irl)  influence their work lives.

the thing i have in mind rn is the latest jk rowling tweet where she was trying to stand up for a woman who lost her job due to tweets [with her opinion].

jk rowling has never been against trans people and people misconstrued her tweet to seem like she was. when in fact she was trying to bring up that people are allowed their own opinions on social media & having those opinions bleed into the workplace and affect a persons job [even if the person never brought those thoughts/opinions to light at the job] isnt a great thing.
