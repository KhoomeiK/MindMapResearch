AskAnAmerican,ff9a08p,t1_ff8yvz2,1579708242.0,"Basically. The Dixiecrat split happened in the 40s, when Democrats added civil rights to their policy plans. Conservative Deffmocrats didn't like that and formed their own caucus within the Dem party, but didn't split off and join the Republican party til the Civil Rights Act era in the 60s."
AskAnAmerican,ff98oso,t1_ff96gbh,1579707412.0,"The party names stayed the same, but the policies changed. The Democrats started pushing civil rights in the 60s as the Republicans started pushing fear of blacks. Democrats started working on the issues present in the ghettos as Republicans courted the KKK.

It's not that the Democratic party didn't at one time oppose integration while Lincoln freed the slaves; it's that the two parties traded voting blocs in the 40s-60s and now white supremacists vote exclusively Republican while Democrats are the only ones (as a whole, not individuals) willing to vote for non-white candidates"

AskAnAmerican,ff94te0,t1_ff37lon,1579704854.0,"Right, and thank goodness they failed. My point, though, is that feudalism is not free trade. If the crops were controlled by English people and sold off while the Irish starved, and the government enforced such rules, that's more akin to genocide by famine, like what Stalin did to Ukraine, and not a failure of the free market. In fact Irish farmers had no access to a free market; only the English farm-owners did. Similarly, the English government refused to lift tariffs on foreign crops that could have been shipped in to relieve the famine; this was a failing of the English government, not the market."

AskAnAmerican,ff93yc2,t1_ff932pz,1579704265.0,"Tradition, setup cost, and convenience for residents are probably the main reasons. The boxes all need individual keys, the boxes need to be constructed and installed, and people prefer home delivery. I'd also wager that your subdivision is newer than the other one; the Postal Service has been installing cluster boxes in subdivisions for a few decades now, but it's rare they'll change a community's delivery method unless they really need to.

As a side note, I find it curious that you have 5 or 6 whole cluster boxes for only 50 homes. I recently visited a trailer park that had 3 cluster boxes at the main entrance for over 100 addresses."
AskAnAmerican,ff92jro,t1_ff8vsjb,1579703268.0,"As an addon, there are towns and small cities in rural areas which are exceptionally dense, and that almost exclusively use wall-mounted post boxes/mail slots and PO boxes, yet the mail deliverer walks their entire route. Rather than having mail in his/her vehicle, the deliverer picks up mail at locked, green corner mail boxes along their route, so that they don't need to make constant return trips to the post office.

My own town, for example is home to 3,000 people in 0.24 square miles (0.3mi x 0.8mi), or 12,500 people/square mile. That's denser than West Philly (11,000/sq mi), yet you can wave at someone almost on the other side of town. We have two walking postmen and one who drives a van to the surrounding villages and business parks, as well as dropping off packages throughout town."

AskAnAmerican,ff34di5,t1_fezpsiu,1579533372.0,"The Irish potato famine? That wasn't free trade; that was the English taking Irish non-potato crops for use in England and leaving the Irish to starve.

AskAnAmerican,ff3313y,t1_fezmvcu,1579532376.0,"Yes. My local ambulance service lets you buy an annual subscription, so that you only need to pay half of the remaining fee after your insurance has paid what they will. EG, my ambulance bill is $1000; my insurance determines it was a real emergency and covers $800; I owe $200, but if I paid my annual subscription fee ($30) I only owe $100. Mind you, $30 is the household fee; if I lived alone I could pay just $25 for a 50% discount on the part of my ambulance bill that my insurance refuses to cover.   :D"
AskAnAmerican,ff3255t,t1_fezi21p,1579531694.0,Speak for yourself. Plenty of companies don't have anything that isn't mandated by the government. They also usually pay their workers just above minimum wage.
cringe,ff303ko,t1_ff2i0wf,1579530048.0,"Depends. If the automatic transmission is in 4th with the engine running at a slow rpm (1-3k), forcing it down to 3rd is fine. If the rpms are maxed out in 4th, the car's computer shouldn't allow you to downshift (my 04 Corolla won't go down to 2nd until my 3rd-gear speed goes down to a level that won't blow my engine apart upon shifting to 2nd). However, regularly dropping his transmission to 3rd while at a speed that pushes his engine up to 5-6k rpms all of a sudden is not good. A few times isn't terrible, but he's doing it multiple times a day and will damage important parts. He's also running his engine nearly at the redline in 3rd just to make it loud, which will wear the engine out much faster than normal driving."

Wellthatsucks,feb2uc9,t1_f9ax7qi,1578954950.0,"Just as cars can sit on a hill, with just enough throttle to not roll back and not move forward, trains can do the same."
Wellthatsucks,feb0h5q,t1_f99w4r3,1578954195.0,"That section of rail may have been particularly smooth, while the other wheels still had enough traction to not spin. Imagine sitting in a 2-wheel drive car (automatic transmission) facing up a hill: it's possible for you to apply just the right amount of throttle for your car to not move forward, but not roll backward either. The car's not moving, but the tires aren't spinning either, unless you floor it.

Now picture a 4-wheel-drive truck in the same situation, but the back wheels are on ice. The front wheels will sit there, not spinning, because they're gripping the asphalt. The back wheels will spin because there's way less grip on the ice. The wheels are all getting the same power, but the ones with no grip will spin.

That's basically what happen in the photo. Thing is, once an object is sliding, it actually has less grip with whatever it's sliding on (static friction is stronger than sliding friction), so the wheel that's spinning will now continue spinning unless power is reduced or the train starts moving so that it can grip a better section of rail. As the wheel spins against the rail, it generates heat, just like a car doing a burnout will melt/burn its tires. The wheel gets heat applied all around its circumference, while the rail gets heated up in just that one spot, causing it to not only get ground down even easier, but also to sag and collapse as seen in the photo.

As for how the wheels kept grinding several inches down? Each axle is independently suspended by the bogie (the metal frame that connects the axles to the locomotive/ rail car). Just like how a tractor trailer's wheels can go up and down so that all three axles maintain contact with the ground, the bogies on a train work the same way, with springs pushing the axles down to maintain contact with the rails while letting the wheels go up to get over bumps in the rails (or pennies that people place on the railheads).

Sorry if this got too in-depth. I'm procrastinating"
Wellthatsucks,feaxdpi,t1_f9ax0m5,1578953187.0,"Most diesel-electric engines in North America are either 4 total axles with all 4 axles powered, 6 axles with 4 powered, or 6 axles with all six powered. On electric engines, it's often the same arrangement. For steam engines, the Whyte numbering system tells you how many wheels are powered [2-8-0 is two guide wheels (one axle) followed by 8 powered wheels (4 axles) and zero trailing wheels. 4-6-6-4 is 2 guide axles, two sets of 3 powered axles, and 2 trailing axles to support the cab.] Steam locos with only one powered axle went out of fashion on standard-gauge railroads in the early-mid 19th century."
Wellthatsucks,feavxl3,t1_f988nax,1578952725.0,"Locomotives since the 1920s (maybe earlier) have sand reservoirs that can shoot sand to the rails where the wheels sit, in order to increase grip. The train's crew could theoretically back up to a gentler slope, though this could be very time consuming. An extra locomotive (or several) can also join the train, which is very common in the Appalachains and Rockies."

First is that everything is part of God's plan - that is, everything is completely predetermined. Following this idea, the videographer is thanking God for deigning that he should survive the fire, either because the fire wasn't meant to kill him or because God's plan worked out that he chose to go to where the fire wasn't.

Second is the idea that things happen as they happen, but sometimes God or an angel intervenes on behalf of somebody praying for such an intervention. By this reasoning the videographer is thanking God for intervening in his life and preventing the fire from killing him. A guardian angel or a patron saint may have done the intervening or made a personal plea to God for intervention on the man's behalf.

I'm not saying I agree with either, but I WILL say that the second school of thought was taught at my Roman Catholic elementary/middle school."
