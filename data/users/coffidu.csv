languagelearning,fez8ons,t3_eqz2gm,1579454869.0,"Congrats! How are you finding the Polish course? I completed it a few years ago but I still found myself struggling with the absolute basics. I really *had* to branch out and use other sources than Duolingo, the only Duolingo language I've really had that problem with."
Agoraphobia,feyga3i,t3_eqpcn1,1579445114.0,"I always bring my phone. I never actually use it, it’s just incredibly comforting to feel it in my hand."
Transmedical,feu3y2q,t3_eqmdz9,1579382902.0,"I wonder if any other binary trans people feel similarly, but I find that being asked my pronouns is incredibly upsetting. I’ve spent so much time and effort trying to be perceived as male... and people still can’t tell which pronouns to use?! It makes me feel awful about myself as it feels like “proof” I don’t pass. 

I do try to respect people’s pronouns but I admit that I tend to inwardly roll my eyes when someone’s pronouns are the complete opposite of their presentation (and they’re *not* a newbie at transitioning)."
FTMMen,feo8dd8,t3_eq1pty,1579296499.0,"I get it. It seems as though most transmen I come across start taking hormones at 16-18 and have top surgery about a year after. It makes me so depressed that I’ll never have that opportunity, and it makes me feel like a “fake” because I’m not in a position to pursue medical transition at the moment. I feel so bitter towards everyone who transitions and I feel horrible because of it, but I can’t help it. It just reminds me of how helpless my current situation is."
fatlogic,fegre1m,t1_fegg3os,1579100761.0,"1200 *is* low, it's the lowest amount recommended for a woman to eat to be healthy. Men shouldn't go below 1500. I also have an incredibly low TDEE (practically bedbound) so I'll always have a tiny deficit, but that doesn't mean 1200 is suddenly *not* incredibly low."

fatlogic,fegp4di,t3_eomg76,1579099194.0,"I've been depression-binging non-stop since mid November, and I've been eating especially poorly the past ~10 days, following a suicide attempt. But yesterday I managed not to binge, and so far today I've eaten sensibly. I'm hoping this is a sign that I'm nearing the end of this binge cycle!"
AskReddit,fed04x0,t1_fecdo2f,1578992042.0,"I was similarly addicted to MMORPGs for a few years during secondary school. It didn’t screw me up as severely as your friend, but it did make me struggle in school and it badly affected my health and hygiene. The only way out for me was to just quit cold-turkey. Even now I’m hesitant to get back into any sort of gaming because I know how much it can consume you."
fatlogic,feb6evz,t1_fe52knj,1578955811.0,"I agree completely. One of the things that's inspiring me to start thinking about recovering from bulimia (getting healthier and in shape in the process) is that I'm in a similar situation to the woman in the image - I'm transgender and need surgery. Rather than blaming the doctors for the fact that surgery is less effective on individuals with high body fat percentages, I'll be working towards doing something about it. Seems like the rational option to me, but what would I know, I have more than three brain cells."
EDAnonymous,feab29s,t3_eo2jtp,1578946485.0,"Do you know if the app is mainly geared towards anorexia/restrictive disorders, or would it also be suitable for someone with bulimia? I'm becoming more and more interested in recovery lately but it would have to be self-guided."
EDAnonymous,feaakip,t3_eo5oa3,1578946316.0,"I don't go to the doctors for checkups, but I do get weighed when I'm having my medication adjusted (although that's for obvious reasons). If I were to go for a checkup (or an ED-related visit) I'd assume my weight would be taken."
EDAnonymous,feaa6h2,t3_eo7drv,1578946187.0,"Honestly I know how you feel. I really want to recover, but seeing people like that makes me feel as though it's inevitable I'll gain lots of weight when I recover, or that gaining weight is an intrinsic part of recovery. It terrifies me so much."
EDAnonymous,fea9ul0,t3_eo7ek3,1578946073.0,"Yep. I'm about 5'2 and due to health/lifestyle issues I'm practically bedbound at the moment. My TDEE - NOT my BMR - is about 1,300. I'll basically have to starve myself forever. :("
languagelearning,fea3njt,t3_eo5f0q,1578944019.0,"I've noticed this with the Teach Yourself series of books. They supposedly get you to a B2 level - L.M.A.O. I've finished a few of their books and ended up as a shaky A2 at best. I think it's purely a marketing technique, although I do think it's detrimental to learners as it may give them a false impression of their proficiency level."
languagelearning,fea2yks,t3_eo8a6c,1578943811.0,"I'm in a part-time adult ed Welsh class, and before that I took three languages at school (which I loathed). Although as a teenager I hated language classes because I felt they went too quickly and the teachers never explained anything (they focused on naturally absorbing patterns, which is the complete opposite of how I learn), nowadays I'm really enjoying my Welsh class. It complements my self-study and gives me an opportunity to practice speaking - I hadn't spoken a single word of Welsh before starting in September! - and have contact with a native speaker who can correct my language usage. 

I wouldn't recommend (part-time) classes as someone's sole resource, as the pace is relatively slow and you're limited to the curriculum of whatever book/course is being used, but they're definitely a useful resource."
languagelearning,fe6vqxa,t3_enqld3,1578906275.0,"I listened to my first piece of ""authentic"" (non-Duolingo) Portuguese - someone talking about their experience learning Portuguese - and I understood most of it, even without subtitles.

More of an overcoming-anxiety-success, but I also managed to send a short email to my tutor in Welsh."
EDAnonymous,fdqp2dn,t3_eml30o,1578671806.0,"It’s an individual thing. I have bulimia and fasting (intermittent or otherwise) often helps me get out of bad binge/purge cycles and helps encourage me to follow healthy eating patterns. If you’re prone to restriction I wouldn’t recommend it, however."
