AmItheAsshole,ffdultx,t1_ffc8tzr,1579829318.0,"I agree with this.

I completely understand OPs position, but I sympathize with SIL. 

When I’m breastfeeding, baby and I are a package deal. I can’t leave my breastfed baby for a week. If you’re inviting me, I would be like “sure, but baby will have to come too”. It’s not necessarily me inviting baby along, just letting you know that I can’t leave her behind. So if you want me to come along, that’s just what needs to happen.

A lot depends on the baby, some are easy going and some are more challenging. I’ve travelled with my daughter and she goes with the flow. So much easier than now that she’s a toddler. I’d rather be able to hang out and do some of the stuff and go back to the hotel early than miss the whole thing. My friends/family would be cool with that, but that’s our own dynamic. Different groups have different ideas.

If that’s not ok, just let her know. But I don’t think anyone is really an asshole here, just a miscommunication."
AskWomen,ffc6n96,t1_ffc3y7l,1579792763.0,I understand that. The comment I responded to said that a nurse (which would be a RN) legally can’t tell you results.

AmItheAsshole,femv5ks,t1_femn2q9,1579270446.0,"I’m American and most people I know think that gender reveal parties are cringey.

Some people will include a gender reveal aspect to their baby shower, which I have less of an issue with because it’s not a separate party. Or they’ll just do something for close family when everyone is already getting together for dinner or something. But the whole separate party thing is just stupid and attention grabby (not to mention gift grabby if gifts are expected)."

AmItheAsshole,femuhxd,t1_femp9yt,1579269945.0,"We didn’t find out with our daughter. I swore that she was a boy and my husband insisted the baby was a girl. As soon as she was born and my husband got to announce to me that “it’s a girl!”, I was like “of course you are” (not snarky, but genuinely felt that she was perfect). As soon as you hold that baby, you’ll feel that they are exactly who they were meant to be.

Currently pregnant with our second and we’re not going to find out this time too. It was an amazing experience in the delivery room. Also, we got all of our baby gear in gender neutral themes and have a bunch of gender neutral newborn/0-3 month clothes."
progresspics,fek5al0,t1_fejne71,1579192909.0,"You look fantastic and don’t let the haters get you down.

I do suggest that instead of aiming for xxx weight, assess when you stop by how you look, feel, body fat, etc. If you’re in a healthy weight range, the exact number doesn’t matter as much as body composition. Don’t obsess about hitting exactly 20 more pounds, but look at everything in a more complete view.

To be clear, Im not suggesting that you are obsessing. I’m just cautioning against being too specific number focused."

running,fe941sv,t3_eo32yw,1578933979.0,"Make sure you’re getting outside. It’s very different running on a treadmill vs outside. Treadmills are great for certain things, but they won’t get you completely ready.

I highly recommend trying to do a 5k distance outside at least once a week leading up to the race. This can be a run/walk combo while you try to add more running as you get more training in."
running,fe93kz6,t1_fe8sx1b,1578933787.0,"I agree that ordinary people should be able to complete the distance. It’s the sub-35 min comment that’s harsh. It took me a good year and a half of consistent training and weight loss to get that fast. I’ve never been sub 33 minutes.

fatlogic,fdvvhch,t1_fdutma6,1578751975.0,"This isn’t true (at least for older teens 15-19)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6014772/

“Conclusion: The risk of poor pregnancy outcome is not higher in teenage pregnancies compared to pregnancies in the 20 to 35 years age group if confounding factors, including socioeconomic factors, are carefully controlled.”

Teen pregnancy is a bad idea for many reasons, but physically it’s not more dangerous as long as they get proper prenatal care. The problems arise mostly due to lack of care, socioeconomic issues, dropping out of school, maturity, etc. Physically, older teens are just as capable of healthily carrying a pregnancy as adults."
My600lbLife,fdn82te,t1_fdn20xx,1578579819.0,"I wish they would tell us their height at the beginning. It really makes a huge difference.

Women can be their own worst enemies."
AmItheAsshole,fcn6nv0,t1_fcmwy4h,1577804666.0,"There’s no way for them to know. Even if someone is only at 5cm, they go to 10cm quickly and be pushing. Fast labors are fast. Slow labors can speed up. Labor is unpredictable, which is part of what makes it scary. Things can happen in minutes or seconds. 

The doctor is an idiot for trying to predict anything. This is why women who get sent home because they aren’t far enough along end up having babies in their car. I know several women who were told to come back later and just hung out in the hospital instead (waiting room, walking around) and ended up being accepted an hour or two later."
AmItheAsshole,fcn5r8e,t1_fcm43r6,1577803996.0,"Doesn’t matter if it’s going to take a while. Most women are in labor for close to 24hours (if you include early labor where you can still hang out at home). Many women are even longer. It’s long and it’s painful and they need support. 

Sounds like he only cares about the pushing part, which makes him double the asshole. He only cared about the part that meant something for him (baby coming out) and not that his wife needed support."
