You can't lean without aiming, so most people don't when holding a gadget (you can't lean with a drone but can with everything else). The angle can help depending on the throw. But pc has an easier time with a few things, shotgun holes, holding angles, throwing stuff. It's just smoother on the pc. FPS may play a wild in that too, console is capped at 60fps but if I play on PC is like 200, it's a major difference."

Rainbow6,fdohjqh,t1_fdnn4qp,1578605278.0,"The only difference between console and pc high levels is the ability to lean without ads and smaller field of view. Which makes console harder to hold certain angles. 

Aiming on PC is tremendously easier but at high levels on console people can still aim well, it's just tiny micro movements the joysticks struggle at.  Also high end strats are the same on both platforms. The idea that ""diamonds on console are silvers on PC"" is just ridiculous, hell there's a pro player on PC right now that came from xbox.

Rainbow6,fdkqcog,t1_fdk0f69,1578508955.0,"So to give you a real answer, one person got most of the reasons right but there's more to it that makes it worse. It's imbalanced for both sides as no one is able to do anything correctly and may be their worst designed map ever.

So in ranked, at high plat and diamond the map is a nightmare slog and sometimes you'd win cause the other team would just surrender as soon as possible (or your team would), if that's any hint to the feelings of this map at high levels of play.

First major issue is play style, you are forced to play completely horizontal aside from a handful of hatches. What that essentially means is that defenders ALWAYS know what the attackers will do. They can literally sit all 5 on site if they wanted to and aim at the entrances and breach hole. It's dumb and boring.

Next thing is layout, the map is a circle with no real dead end. This means as a roamer you be everywhere all the time but it also means you can never just sit and hold a position properly. From the attacker side this is way worse, a roamer can literally just keep moving without ever having to cross some hallway you're holding. So you have to get him out, but there's all these stupid little run through rooms and there's 2 fucking floors of this maze. In other words it can take over 2 minutes to actually get the asshole and can literally take your entire team to do it. But the terrible design of the map doesn't truly allow for you to ignore the roamer because every entrance to site or breachable wall is part of this ever loop that can be peaked at any moment. This creates situations where you can't ""pinch"" a site, you have to send people in 1 at a time to peak it while others hold outside angles. And in rainbow hoping you actually peak the right corner first so you can hopefully win your gun fight isn't any strategy, it's luck or desperate plays. 

Now the big issue that makes everything else even worse, the sound design. ""Meet the sound guy!"" has been a joke with my friends since they had that thing for him on the banner, and this map exemplifies everything wrong with sound in this game. As an attacker or defender, coming into the main hall in this map is just horrific. There is a cat walk, a 2nd, and a 1st floor. If someone is moving not only can you not tell which floor they're on, you don't even know which fucking direction they're going. The sound travels randomly throughout this entire giant area. So all those issues with roamers are even worse. And on the defense side it's not great either because you can barely guess where they're coming from. Is it 3 people on the cat walk or 1 person on each floor? 

Overall it's not a fun map, someone said just run around and play it like call of duty and that's pretty much the best way to play because trying anything else probably has the same chance of working out. 

Hope this kind of gives a sense of how just awfully designed the map is. It takes all the fun interesting things in this game and nullifies them while making all the terrible things really pop."
Morrowind,fdjeb2z,t1_fdhxlei,1578467224.0,"The ""Earth Bones"" are a thing in elder scrolls as the Ehlnofey. Earth is a well understood term in universe.

So they drag up the ""sea monster"" which is really a dead, rotting, and bloated ray. But the important thing here is, everyone is so focused here on this dead and rotten thing. ""This will make you millions!"" is said by one of them. Marcello doesn't really care beyond a cursory interest but he's still there and involved. Also remeber Marcello originally wanted to be an author who writes about beautiful and important things, it's important here.

As all the people gather around the monster and yap about it he goes and sits on that shallow embankment, where he spots this beautiful young girl playing and dancing in the ocean. She doesn't care about the monster and she waves to him and tries to communicate with him to come over to her.

He then proceeds to say he can't hear her or understand her but she is still beckoning him over. Eventually he shrugs and laughs and stands up, a woman takes him by the hand and he walks off following the crowd dragging a rotting corpse of a beast, which still has gazing eyes.

The girl represents what he's missing out on, an actual fulfilling life. He's missing the beautiful sparkling ocean to focus being part of the crowd following the putrid monster.  There's hopes it'll get him around money or a good gossip story, which the previous 3 hours spent showing you how aimless and unhappy a lot of that ""money and gossip"" was. As he walks off he kind of shrugs and goes back to not really having anything to care about, while the girl in the dress continues to smile and play in the water."

The film LA Dolce Vida (Fellini, 1960) is about Marcello, as one of the biggest ""paparazzi"" in Italy as a gossip columnist. Ekberg plays Sylvia a famous Swedish-American actress who's annoyed constantly by the paparazzi and Marcello keeps trying to get her alone cause he wants to sleep with her. This is not a full account of the story, but just watch the movie it's fantastic. 

Marcello was based off of Felice Quinto ""the king of paparazzi"". She shot Quinto in the hand with the bow for stalking her, waiting outside her house in the early morning. He used to hide in bushes and what not to sneak up on stars. 

Life imitates art I suppose.



EDIT : To add on to what was said below cause it's a fun tidbit...

Fellini originally offered Quinto the role of Signor Paparazzo, Marcello's photographer. Quinto turned it down but did play an extra. This is where the term for these people being called ""paparazzi"" came from."
