offmychest,fbwyxgk,t1_fbwy41d,1577163353.0,"I know, I have a problem. My family haven't noticed it, even when I flat out mentioned it. I guess because I'm usually jovial people don;t associate me with having serious mental issues or struggling with an addiction but I don't have any real desire to stop. I mean, why stop? I know that I could choose to change my life, turn it into something good but I've tried that.

People never gave me a chance to prove that I am good, nor that I could do good. Because they listen to my mother or choose to judge me for what she does, or some lie they've told themselves, every year I end up alone and if I have something to mourn? I'm dealing with it alone.

One of my friends recently died, killed in a horrific accident and all anyone could say to me was that her death 'doesn't matter as much' to me because her son and I can't see eye to eye. A couple people weren't shitty to me about it and comforted me, but being told I don't care hurt. I can't go to her funeral because her son (my old friend) doesn't want me there.

It's one more thing to my life that I want to forget.

You're right there though, people do care and that's obvious (hell, I don't even know who you are and I feel like someone gives a rat's ass). Just I wish people could try to get to know me before they assume things, they'd be surprised about how I actually felt.

Thank you you made a difference in my life, believe it or not. I don't know when I'll stop drinking, but hopefully I could find a way sooner than later."
offmychest,fbwxk9w,t1_fbww7h8,1577162167.0,"Thank you. I wish that I could believe that I mattered all that much, but the truth is, if I kick the bucket yeah people will mourn but who is it that they will?

The person that they didn't really know? Or the person they thought they knew? 

I don't want to kill myself, I just can't find the reason to care bout my health, you know? When I drink, I'm happy. When I don't, shit just gets bad for me.

I really appreciate you reaching out and helping, it means more than you know."
offmychest,fbwvjqy,t1_fbwu5jm,1577160574.0,"I've been tired of being sick and tired, I don't want to be here anymore.

My life has been nothing but bad shit, since I could remember Life hasn't meant shit to me since I was a child and I doubt it'll start any time now. I am grateful for your response, I just needed some truth to come out and here it is."
