My mother is typing this for me, because I can‚Äôt. She is crying. Don‚Äôt cry, Mommy! Mommy is always sad, but she says it‚Äôs not my fault. I asked her if it was God‚Äôs fault, but she didn‚Äôt answer, and only started crying harder, so I don‚Äôt ask her that anymore. The reason she is so sad is that I‚Äôm so sick. I was born without a body. It doesn‚Äôt hurt, except when I go to sleep.
The doctors gave me an artificial body. My body is a burlap bag filled with leaves. The doctors said that was the best they could do on account of us havin‚Äô no money or insurance. I would like to have a body transplant, but we need more money. Mommy doesn‚Äôt work because she said employers don‚Äôt hire crying people. I said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry, Mommy,‚Äù and she hugged my burlap body. Mommy always gives me hugs, even though she‚Äôs allergic to burlap, and it chafes her real bad.
I hope you will help me. You can help me if you upvote this comment. Dr. Johansen said if you upvote then Elon Musk will team up with Facebook and do a survey with SpaceX. Then the astronauts will collect prayers from school children all over America and take them up to space so that the angels can hear them better. Then they will go to the Pope, and he will take up a collection in church and send the money to the doctors. The doctors could help me better then.
Maybe one day I will be able to play baseball. Or maybe just use my lungs and heart, when the doctors make them. The doctors said that every time you upvote this comment, the astronauts can take another prayer to the angels. Please help me. Mommy is so sad, and I want a body. I don‚Äôt want my leaves to rot before I turn 10.
If you don‚Äôt upvote this, that‚Äôs OK. Mommy says you‚Äôre a mean heartless person who doesn‚Äôt care about a poor little boy with only a head. She says that she hopes that you stew in the raw pit of your own guilt-ridden stomach. What kind of wretched person are you that you can‚Äôt take five lousy seconds to upvote this so that all the redditors can feel guilt and shame for the rest of their day, and then maybe help a poor, bodiless nine-year-old boy?
Please help me. This really sucks. I try to be happy but it‚Äôs hard. I wish

You no longer take in enough oxygen to sustain consciousness. 60,000 feet. CNN is reporting on all the world records you've broken. 200,000 feet. You are no longer alive. The poop accelerates. Your body disintegrates but your poop contrail remains. NASA can no longer track you. You break the light-speed barrier and we can no longer bear witness. The poop accelerates. Forever.

My mother is typing this for me, because I can‚Äôt. She is crying. Don‚Äôt cry, Mommy! Mommy is always sad, but she says it‚Äôs not my fault. I asked her if it was God‚Äôs fault, but she didn‚Äôt answer, and only started crying harder, so I don‚Äôt ask her that anymore. The reason she is so sad is that I‚Äôm so sick. I was born without a body. It doesn‚Äôt hurt, except when I go to sleep.
The doctors gave me an artificial body. My body is a burlap bag filled with leaves. The doctors said that was the best they could do on account of us havin‚Äô no money or insurance. I would like to have a body transplant, but we need more money. Mommy doesn‚Äôt work because she said employers don‚Äôt hire crying people. I said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry, Mommy,‚Äù and she hugged my burlap body. Mommy always gives me hugs, even though she‚Äôs allergic to burlap, and it chafes her real bad.
I hope you will help me. You can help me if you upvote this comment. Dr. Johansen said if you upvote then Elon Musk will team up with Facebook and do a survey with SpaceX. Then the astronauts will collect prayers from school children all over America and take them up to space so that the angels can hear them better. Then they will go to the Pope, and he will take up a collection in church and send the money to the doctors. The doctors could help me better then.
Maybe one day I will be able to play baseball. Or maybe just use my lungs and heart, when the doctors make them. The doctors said that every time you upvote this comment, the astronauts can take another prayer to the angels. Please help me. Mommy is so sad, and I want a body. I don‚Äôt want my leaves to rot before I turn 10.
If you don‚Äôt upvote this, that‚Äôs OK. Mommy says you‚Äôre a mean heartless person who doesn‚Äôt care about a poor little boy with only a head. She says that she hopes that you stew in the raw pit of your own guilt-ridden stomach. What kind of wretched person are you that you can‚Äôt take five lousy seconds to upvote this so that all the redditors can feel guilt and shame for the rest of their day, and then maybe help a poor, bodiless nine-year-old boy?
Please help me. This really sucks. I try to be happy but it‚Äôs hard. I wish
I had a puppy. I wish I could hold a puppy.
But anyways I‚Äôm going off track. Very nice, I wish I could give you gold, but take this instead! üèÖ

Thank You.
