depression,fcm89u8,t3_ehrota,1577766876.0,If you canâ€™t find a reason for you to stay here do it for your brother. He will not know what to do and I can guarantee that he looks up to you as the coolest dude ever! Find a way to do everything for your brother or family or whoever means a lot to you. We are here for you and we love you
depression,fcm7ww3,t3_ehve2q,1577766587.0,I tried the same thing a couple weeks ago. I now have to wear a sweatshirt around school to hide my mangled arms and chest. I then tried hanging myself and that did not work. I cut the rope and fell to the ground and just lied there for hours. But I came here and with the help of the people here I am slowly working toward recovery. We are all here for you and PM me anytime if you need to talk.
depression,fclxdtr,t1_fclq5d5,1577758792.0,I was taking in maybe two hundred calories. You will be amazed at what you can put your body through when emotional pain. I was very suicidal at the time and I was running until I dropped
depression,fclpqed,t1_fcloyvh,1577753477.0,I ran about 10+ miles a day as well as lifted and boxed. I worked out like a maniac to try to make my physical pain match my emotional pain.
depression,fckfe13,t3_ehmqfh,1577724099.0,My gf broke my heart and so I stopped eating for a week and my depression came back. I just ran like a maniac and lost 12lbs in a week
depression,fcjdcup,t3_ehezz0,1577683722.0,My gf completely blindsided me and broke up with me. That shit really hurt me and I felt like killing myself. I only started cutting but that does not work and is not good. Anytime you feel pain or any sort of remorse use that as your motivation and work out. That is what I am doing and I have lost 14 pounds in two weeks. Use your anger pain sadness etc. as your fuel to make yourself your best you. We can all get through this together. Hang in there bro ðŸ‘Š
depression,fcjcgwb,t3_ehg34e,1577682965.0,"I agree, every time I tell my friends I want affection or intimacy from someone they just think I want sex. I miss the hugs and the affection that my girlfriend used to give me but now that she broke up with me I feel hollow and abandoned. All my friends have left me and I am all alone"
depression,fcjbm6i,t3_ehgwoc,1577682258.0,It feels great when you call it and you are number fifty seventh in line. I whole heartily agree. Fuck the hotline
