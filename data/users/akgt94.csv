nonononoyes,ff1qj7p,t3_er3ela,1579483959.0,THIS is the evacuation boat on big oil platforms. Assigned seats. 4 point harnesses. 40-ish people capacity. Visitors (me) get the bottom level because that's where all the puke lands. Fortunately I never had to ride one for real.

Pixel3,felic4n,t3_epgsdp,1579222865.0,Yes it's a nice phone but don't pay full price for something that's a year and a half old.  I only paid $400 (after bill credits).
dogs,fefoe69,t3_eosr75,1579060799.0,Yes.  We had two. The second was the follower. Used to call him Me Too before it meant something else. First dog died so he had no one to follow. Lethargic. Stopped eating. Was living on a few tasty treats. After 2 month got another dog and he's back to his old self. They wrestle 2 or 3 times a day and groom each other so it was a perfect match.
dogs,fefn2d1,t3_eot6nd,1579059898.0,Deli turkey. Cut into tiny cubes ahead of time. Can give them a lot without over feeding
dogs,fefm2ce,t1_fefaltb,1579059240.0,"Mine got the halti bottom strap slack and into his mouth and bit clean through it. Been using martingale AND Gentle Leader (clip leash through both rings) on walks. Leash reactive and wiggles around a bit like a fish, but isn't able to pull hard. Treat and sit to redirect and reset. Sizing down on the Gentle Leader seems to work better so the two rings are close together before you clip the leash to them."
Cameras,fefiowu,t3_eostc6,1579057140.0,"Ive got money to spend and am flip flopping between the Sony a6400 and Fuji X-T30. Both seem to have good dynamic range and low light performance.  Played with the Sony a bit. Lots of menus. Liking the look of the Fuji. Just a couple of dials to change shooting settings. Haven't actually held one yet.  This seems to be the end of the road for DSLR in that price range. Canon and Nikon have all but admitted they're moving to mirrorless in the entry level and enthusiast ranges, so decided to only consider mirrorless. Waiting for one of them to go on sale again."
Pixel3,feefxx3,t1_fee6sug,1579032953.0,You over-estimate my importance. I'm not going to convince my wife and my friends to move to WhatsApp just because I don't have iMessage.

reactivedogs,fec1qp1,t3_eoapdr,1578965385.0,Ha! Our old dog used to bark at commercials too. No idea where he picked it up - we didn't have a doorbell.
Pixel3,fec0w6t,t3_eobg8p,1578965003.0,"I have a Pixel 3. Everyone else I know has an iPhone. Photos and videos over SMS sssssuuuucks. I'm always yelling at my wife to email me things instead of text. She says no one else complains (because they have iMessage). Then the fight starts. Otherwise, don't consider anything other than Pixel. Samsung, LG and everyone else are slow to update their software (if at all) and they bundle a ton of other crapware that they prevent you from uninstalling. Pixel is the closest you'll get to the Apple experience outside of Apple.  I like the customization. Night Sight is great. Don't have other Apple products. Never going back."

Cameras,fdtdhro,t3_emumkx,1578715199.0,"I have the same question but for stills only. X-T30 with 2 XF lenses have wider apertures than the Sony 2 lens kits (18-50 and 50-200 ish), but it's outside my price range. X-T30 and 2 XC lenses seems comparable  to the Sony. Fuji seems a shorter upgrade path to faster zooms than Sony. Is it?"
