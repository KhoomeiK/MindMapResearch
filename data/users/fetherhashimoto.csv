Veterinary,feb5bm0,t1_feavxca,1578955572.0,"Yea I’ve been looking at different post bacc programs that offer a “pre-vet” pathway. My major right now is environmental studies, so I get some of the pre read out of the way but not all of them. I was also considering taking classes at the CC near my university to get those baseline prereqs out of the way then taking the bigger classes like ochem and bio chem at my university

Thank you for your input and advice-it’s MUCH appreciated"
