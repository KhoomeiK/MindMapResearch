gaming,fgc96wt,t1_fgbv2rs,1580670412.0,"It's more about the accuracy of it. The new mirrors edge for example had a lot of pre-baked ray traced visuals that made the enviroments look absolutely stunning, but all of that falls through once you introduce dynamic lighting and daylight. Just looking at ray traced minecraft for example is absolutely stunning, the lighting just looks right on every material with ever changing landscapes. The same with raytracing one of the older quakes; the light of the weapons reacts so beautifully with the surrounding, it's just incredibly immersive and probably insanely difficult to do with non-ray tracing technologies, not in a way to not tank performance significantly.

Add that to accurate physics calculations of water, sand, snow and/or grass and there's plenty of potentially game changing technologies that would leave one ""wowed""."

You won't find me argueing that games of today look better than games 5-8 years ago. I'm aware that the technologies, but especially optimizations, are getting better and better and we're getting closer and closer to real life-like graphics on consumer hardware. But it's probably like comparing a 2020 car to a 2010 one. Is the 2020 car better technology wise, comfort wise, design wise? Yeah, probably, but if you were to upgrade from a 2010 to a 2020 model your experience wouldn't change dramatically at all.

It's nothing that makes you drop your jaw, technology wise. The next big thing will probably be a ray tracing implementation that will utilize the technology in such a way to almost completely render a scene with it alone. The RTX demos are well and good, but it's still a very narrow implementation of what ray tracing is truly capable of."

Sometimes the HOYD influences 1-2 players coming through your youth ranks, however that's no guarantee for quality hidden attributes. I've had players that had much better hidden attributes which the HOYD didn't influence. 

Much, much, much more important is having great youth and training facilities, having the highest possible youth recruiting and coaching. Also, as someone mentioned, the country your club is based in plays a huge role too. For example, every country has a certain cap of how talented players can be at any given time. This is not to say you can't have a thai footballer with 200 PA and crazy mental attributes, just that you can't have 2-3 of those at any given time. Brazil, Germany, England etc. however, can have dozens of those.
