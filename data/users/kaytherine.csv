Obviously, as long as if you are organized (no procrastination!) and innately have the mental stamina, then I have fair reason to believe that you will be fine."

As for the many students I’ve encountered... i agree!! seriously, SO many students have made it abundantly clear that they want to transfer to either UGA or GATech—never anywhere else. Both are amazing schools, but the reasons for transferring seem to be completely nebulous. I’ve seen some who say “I want to transfer to ____ next year”; then, they get a reality check when they struggle with the pre-req classes at GSU. It’s disheartening, at least to me, that there isn’t much of a community feel at GSU."
college,fcxvaab,t3_ejeuio,1578070966.0,"Here is an in-progress story. I wasn’t exactly ambitious with my applications. I only had my sights for UGA. My tuition would mostly be covered by Zell (scholarship). The academics are solid. The campus is beautiful (think columns). Most of the teachers I had admired graduated from there, and it was only natural for me to become familiar with the school. A lot of my peers and teachers said that I would have no trouble with it. Anyway, I really believed I had a solid shot of getting accepted. Long story short, I applied early and was waitlisted all the way until the last wave of acceptances around spring time. Words cannot describe how devastated I was when I had lingering hope that I would eventually get off the waitlist. Around December, after early action was released, was the time when I realized I needed to apply to some safeties. I’m now at GSU. I’ve had a handful of problems here that have only motivated me to transfer ASAP from the lack of safety (untraditional campus), some rude students, and unprofessional advisor, which I have reported to SGA. I’ve only gone through one semester so far and currently have a 4.33 GPA. Despite all of this, my main motivating factor is that the academic rigor is simply not there. Maybe it’s because I’m only a first year student, or maybe it’s because I’m sincerely not receiving the education I need. Nonetheless, I am transferring. As for next semester, I’m planning on volunteering at a hospital as well as becoming more involved with club(s) to boost my chances. Also, I’m taking 18 credit hours of transferable coursework. I’ve additionally attended a transfer session in-person. Thus, here’s my advice: give the school a chance. If you end up becoming unhappy, transferring is always an option. Don’t become trapped in an environment you cannot thrive in both academically and emotionally.

edit:
A number of undergrads have to take pre-req courses and courses generally needed to graduate; in a way, there is so much more than the program the school offers. Do heavily consider the financial aid, campus, opportunities, and the atmosphere of the school."
