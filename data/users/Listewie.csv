fatlogic,fds3mat,t3_ems7pb,1578693764.0,"My weight loss has slowed so much which I know is normal, but it was so much more motivating when the weight is falling off and the scale moves down quickly. 

I am 5ish pounds away from a healthy weight and I feel like I am stuck in a rut. I have started c25k and reaching my daily step goal which I am doing quite well at, but my motivation for making healthly food has gone down the drain and I have been avoiding vegetables."
fatlogic,fds2rp6,t1_fdrvx4i,1578693486.0,"Thank you. I am not looking forward to the hungry and cravings again when it is time for number 2. 

Good luck on your weight loss and congratulations on baby number 2!"
fatlogic,fdrvakv,t1_fdrsymi,1578690316.0,I was so hungry the first few months breastfeeding. It got better though and I have lost over 50lbs in the last 7 months. My baby turned 1 a couple weeks ago.
