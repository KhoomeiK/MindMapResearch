Some schools expect you to have taken AB before BC, so students who take BC will only be learning that new 30-40% that they haven't learned that. If you go to a school like that, I would not recommend skipping AB, as you're essentially just skipping a class you didn't learn.


Other schools don't expect you to have taken AB before BC. At schools like that, you'll learn all of the content on the BC test (which includes all AB content) in a year. If you go to one of those schools, you'll be fine. I'd recommend skipping AB in that case.


I'm not sure what system your school runs on, so I'd recommend asking to find out.
