So no, people attacking the rich is nothing like the holocaust. it is a cry for the rich to contribute to society instead of bleeding it dry.

Their avoidance of tax and exploiting entire populations forces tax burdens to become more and more stressed down the ladder. The sheer amount of wealth sitting in offshore accounts is, factually, poverty ending. The amount of that owed in taxes to my country for example could have wiped out the nation's deficit in a night. Austerity that has crippled and all but destroyed the younger generation's social mobility, income etc for a decade, need never have happened. And indeed these mega rich folk's desires to continue avoiding paying their share has led to my country leaving the biggest free trade bloc in the world, which will see the rest of my life being made as difficult as the last decade in order for them to continue adding to these disgusting levels of wealth.

We are now very much in the realms of individuals becoming more powerful and richer than entire states. This is putting unprecedented stress on the rest of society and it is time they fucking paid their way."

So no, people attacking the rich is nothing like the holocaust. it is a cry for the rich to contribute to society instead of bleeding it dry.

Their avoidance of tax and exploiting entire populations forces tax burdens to become more and more stressed down the ladder. The sheer amount of wealth sitting in offshore accounts is, factually, poverty ending. The amount of that owed in taxes to my country for example could have wiped out the nation's deficit in a night. Austerity that has crippled and all but destroyed the younger generation's social mobility, income etc for a decade, need never have happened. And indeed these mega rich folk's desires to continue avoiding paying their share has led to my country leaving the biggest free trade bloc in the world, which will see the rest of my life being made as difficult as the last decade in order for them to continue adding to these disgusting levels of wealth.

We are now very much in the realms of individuals becoming more powerful and richer than entire states. This is putting unprecedented stress on the rest of society and it is time they fucking paid their way."

I think the EM6 was a gun that was redesigned back in the day as well for these kinds of reasons? They did some minor adjustments to one or two guns iirc but like with the rest of the game, they never finished."

bam! gottem. ramp up the price of the loyalty card (it has more than doubled in the last 8 years), but also ramp up the normal viewings as well so the loyalty card is still seen as worthwhile.

que cancellation of loyalty card and no longer go to the cinema...

these companies don't learn. They want profit profit profit. maximise that profit. They all saw Netflix leading the way and now they want a piece. But this isn't cable television anymore. People will just pirate, like you say.

There is no better example than Disney + right now either if you are European; because The Mandalorian isn't even due out for another 3 months here. Yet everyone is spamming baby yoda memes and talking about the show....Wonder how/why........in the 21st century not releasing world wide at the same time and then wondering why your viewings start tanking (because everyones fuckin pirated it long before it arrives on these shores ffs)"

This guy was known by the church to be a pedo for nearly *half a century* and no justice was served. The kid probably didn't see much potential from the justice system.. like the many thousands of others abused over the years by the church all around the world, and *still* getting away with it.

I dont think lessons of turning the other cheek and ""an eye for an eye makes the world go blind"" were going through this poor kids mind when he killed a priest that is responsible for at least one suicide, probably more, and the wrecking of countless lives over that time. 

Justice was served. It was merely old testament style."

It's a setting up for a second season as things start homing in on a coherent story.

gaming,fc3m3bs,t1_fc3enr7,1577392942.0,"i have seen reviews becoming increasingly disjointed from reality - in gaming and in movies - and there has been a big rise in scandals regarding certain people and organisations receiving kick backs to either shit on a product or big it up. 

TFA was poor, lazy, and entirely based upon nostalgia. But it had potential to go anywhere. TLJ was objectively woeful. Bad from a story telling standpoint, character arcs, as part of the wider product (both just as part of the new trilogy and as part of the wider franchise) and well.. just in every regard. it was poor. And then i saw tonnes of pro critics bigging it up as a 10/10. 

Absolute madness. 

I highly suspect here as well that some critics have been paid off by certain other organisations to shit on any Netflix product that comes out as part of the growing battle to knock them down a peg since they started eating up these aforementioned organisations ratings and/or to get people to go on to their own streaming services that may have released recently or will be appearing shortly.."
