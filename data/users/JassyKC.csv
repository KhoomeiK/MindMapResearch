Reflexive sneezing induced by light, and sunlight in particular, is estimated to occur in 18 to 35 percent of the population and is known as the photic sneeze reflex (PSR) or the ACHOO (autosomal dominant compulsive helio-ophthalmic outbursts of sneezing) syndrome. Its genetic nature has been known for at least the last 25 years; it is periodically discussed in the medical literature and lay press.

TooAfraidToAsk,ff8van4,t3_es8sg1,1579697296.0,"It took me a long time to figure out tea. Still figuring it out tbh. A few things from your original post and some things I saw you talking about in the other comments.

The tea is what is in the tea bag. Without it it really is just hot water. You have to let the tea bag sit in the hot water to steep. The amount of time varies with different types of tea. Most I have seen are usually ~3minutes. I usually just taste it after a few minutes instead of going by actual time. If it still tastes like water, leave it in. There are different things you can add, like milk honey sugar, and some work better with different kinds of tea. I usually use honey.

It can take a while to figure out what tea you like and how you like it. But once you do it’s worth it. You could also try a London fog which is earl grey tea, hot milk (instead of water), and a little bit of vanilla or lavender (depending on where you get it from), and you can just leave the tea bag in. They are good."

It’s super annoying. It doesn’t go with the information I have found for MY character and isn’t what I want for her. I have tried speaking up, but it seems like nobody cares what I have to say about it. She has all this information and the DM thinks it’s interesting, so I guess it must be true in their minds.

I’m not great at role playing because I am just quiet, shy, and I don’t think as fast as everyone else. The only thing I really have in this game is my character and I’m proud of her. When the other player does this, I feel like that is being taken away from me just like when they take over me during conversations with NPCs or strategizing."

I don’t know that I would have the energy to redo all of it. I feel like personally I would want to stay here, but the responsible thing would be to go back and not fuck up my life. I guess I should do the responsible thing."

Just be straight with them and tell them you don’t want to hug them because you are in pain. Make sure your body language is clear about this too. Don’t give them an opening to hug you anyway. Afterwards you can apologize, tell them you love them, and explain that it causes too much pain and you don’t like when anybody touches you.

I had a hard time figuring out how to ask my family not to touch me and ended up cringing away from one of them. That was worse.

Or you could always try telling them you are really sick and don’t want to get them sick and just distance yourself all night. But that won’t help for the future."
needadvice,fcoq426,t3_ehenn6,1577838577.0,"I am not totally sure because I’m not familiar with the program. You will still owe money and it might not be worth it to drop out. It might seem like you aren’t retaining it, but there could be other ways. Are there other teachers who might work in a way you learn better? Depending on the program, maybe after you finish and start in the field you would be able to pick up on things better? I know some CNAs who struggled to learn it in their programs but did better and ended up excelling once they started really working in the field."
