A short excerpt:

ìA lengthy donors list was then released by the Foundation in December 2008,[16] which included several politically sensitive donors, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Blackwater Worldwide.[80] The Foundation stated that the disclosures would ensure that ""not even the appearance of a conflict of interest"" would exist once Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.[80]

The foundation has been criticized for receiving donations from Middle-Eastern countries which are seen to oppress women (stoning for adultery, not being able to drive, requiring a male guardian, etc.). These countries include Saudi Arabia ($10ñ25 million), UAE, and Qatar.[81] The foundation accepted these donations even though Hillary Clinton's 2016 Presidential campaign platform guaranteed to break down barriers that held women back.[82]î

If that aint corruption and dirty politics then I donít know what is... fucking Blackwater! And thank you for proving my point. Nothing would change because obviously Hillary has too much power and clout to be held accountable. 

Thank you Trump for giving we the people a way to say fuck off.

A short excerpt:

‚ÄúA lengthy donors list was then released by the Foundation in December 2008,[16] which included several politically sensitive donors, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Blackwater Worldwide.[80] The Foundation stated that the disclosures would ensure that ""not even the appearance of a conflict of interest"" would exist once Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.[80]

The foundation has been criticized for receiving donations from Middle-Eastern countries which are seen to oppress women (stoning for adultery, not being able to drive, requiring a male guardian, etc.). These countries include Saudi Arabia ($10‚Äì25 million), UAE, and Qatar.[81] The foundation accepted these donations even though Hillary Clinton's 2016 Presidential campaign platform guaranteed to break down barriers that held women back.[82]‚Äù

If that aint corruption and dirty politics then I don‚Äôt know what is... fucking Blackwater! And thank you for proving my point. Nothing would change because obviously Hillary has too much power and clout to be held accountable. 

Thank you Trump for giving we the people a way to say fuck off.
