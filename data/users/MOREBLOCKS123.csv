streetwear,fc1nena,t1_fc1ef6e,1577324002.0,"Calling me a sheep whilst donning a supreme cap. You’re cute! 

Anyways, aren’t we just voicing opinions here? You originally said that *you think* kids these days dress like shit. Do you think your opinion holds weight over anyone else’s? Especially with something as subjective as fashion? Because it doesn’t.

Some people might say that men in their late 30’s, wearing yesterday’s T shirt and a 4 year old supreme cap, look shitty. Some people would say that the shape of your glasses makes you look like a caricature from 2012. Some people (like you) would probably disagree with them. That’s ok! That’s what makes it special. At the end of the day you’re just another washed up New Yorker who thinks he left the house looking fresh today.

Basically, what I’m trying to say is: Suck me!"
