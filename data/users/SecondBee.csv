Created fake id and documents to get into sixth form, caught.

Okay so I understand that the tittle makes me sound like a tw*t but I was 1 GCSE away from entering to do A-Levels and I applied to 4 sixth forms and was accepted in to all of them. On results day I went to 3 of the 4 sixth forms and pleaded with admissions to let me do the course even though I was 1 GCSE away and they wouldn't let me, so I tried to enroll at the fourth with fake GCSE Results, Fake name, fake address and fake contact details. They let me enroll and I had been attending that sixth form for roughly 5 months. But today I was pulled out of lesson and confronted, I ran out of campus and cycled all the way home. I understand what I did was extremely stupid but I was planning to do the entire course then before I was going to enter for the exams, drop out and do them privately (with my real details). Will I have any legal repercussions? I am scared they will now find my real identity and I will be prosecuted for fraud or something.

For example: if someone approaches and your dog barks you can interrupt that and prevent it becoming a habitual behaviour. 

You may have to work harder at some things that someone without the same dog in the house will, but overall you should still be able to get to where you want to be.

To me it helps to remind myself that picking up after him is the law, so picking up is easier than the distress I would feel from breaking the law, even if I’m the only one who knew.

If your dog is trained to toilet on cue then asking them to do so near places you can dispose of poop is often preferable than having to carry it around. I do know some neurotypical people who can leave poop and pick it up again on their way back towards the bin but I’m not that kind of person.

The single most over stimulating thing about my dog is when he gets a squeaky toy. Fortunately he has been taught that he can’t just incessantly squeak a toy or it’ll get taken away, but I strongly suggest trying any squeak toys you might want to give the dog.
