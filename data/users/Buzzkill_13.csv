If that is the case, the issues should be specifically mentioned in the review, that is what the review is there for. It makes absolutely no sense to ding stars without providing any useful information to future guests (effectively fooling others into believing everything was great when your rating -*which no one else can see!*\- says it was not). That's not the purpose of a review system.

>It's still a positive review.

Wrong! Dropping below an average of **4.6** stars will have Airbnb threatening you with removing your listing from their platform if you don't ""improve your performance"". Which means that Airbnb considers an average of 4 stars (which is 0.6 points *below* their threshold) as absolutely unacceptable. There's no host with an average of 4 stars on Airbnb, because they're removed long before they hit that bottom.

By rating your hosts with 4 stars just because their place wasn't exactly a luxury accommodation, event though that was clearly stated in the description and reflected in the price, you're just helping to eliminate lower-budget options from Airbnb."
