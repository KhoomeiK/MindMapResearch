relationship_advice,feq1g1e,t3_eq80nd,1579336069.0,"We aren’t married, but my SO and I have an interesting system, and it works for us at least, but I could see how it wouldn’t work for others. One of my coworkers and his wife have a system that I’d like to incorporate when my SO and I get married.

For my SO and I, I make 60% of our joint income and we only have separate accounts, but we pitch 50/50 towards rent/utilities/groceries. I’m really type A, so we agreed that I would handle all the shared finances. I calculate the shared bills for the month, he gives me his half, and then the bills autopay out of my account.

He only has ~$3k in car debt, but I have ~$70k in student loan debt + $17k in car debt, so we each pay for our own debts separately. We’re saving for a house down payment, so we both put the rest of our paychecks into our separate savings accounts and are mindful of any “fun” spending. We are constantly talking about money and where we’re at with our spending/savings to make sure we’re on the same page.

For my coworker and his wife, they make about the same as each other and have a joint account where the bulk of their paychecks go for bills and savings, and then they each have their own side accounts where they put $100 per paycheck as no questions asked money. I like the simplicity of having the joint account for bills, and I also like the idea of having your own account where you don’t feel like you’re dipping into the other person’s money."

OP, you’re NTA at all. I’m a woman and my hair is 3 feet long so I understand the pride and identity that gets tied into it. If people were trying to guilt me into shaving (or even cutting) it, I would have a very difficult time not getting violent with them lmao. You’re not obligated to sacrifice your self esteem in an act of solidarity when there are other ways to show your support."

Rothys,fdm0xbr,t3_em37wa,1578537186.0,"My feet aren’t particularly narrow or wide, I’d say they’re average width, but they’re actually 2 different sizes. My right foot is a 6 and my left is a 6.5 so I always buy a 6.5 to fit my left foot even if it’s looser on the right. I read TONS of reviews on these shoes before I took the plunge, and I decided to size up by half a size and get a 7.

I would say the fit on my right foot is 100% perfect. My toes on my left foot are ever so slightly cramped in the point, but they’re still comfortable. I think if I sized up to a 7.5, my right foot would be slipping out.

So if you’re debating a size for The Point and your feet are the same size as each other, go up one full size for a perfect fit, or half a size for a more snug fit."

AmItheAsshole,fdczb52,t3_ekive3,1578288837.0,"NTA, so confused why people are saying otherwise.

I don’t know what kind of weird relationships these people have, but it’s not flirty AT ALL to tell someone you wouldn’t date them. It’s like that stupid game some girls play of “I said no but you were supposed to know I meant yes” like wtf? As a girl, I don’t understand that immature mind game. Just say what you mean and mean what you say, it’s not hard.

Jokes are supposed to be funny for the audience. It doesn’t seem like it was clear that she was joking, but even as a joke it’s a pretty shitty and uncalled for one, unless you have that roasting relationship already established. “I’m going to put you down and tell you you’re undesirable with this weird backhanded compliment! Haha! So funny!”"

I try to remind myself that it’s not feasible at the moment even if I did decide on yes, so I can revisit it in 7 years or so because I’ll probably feel completely different at that point than I do now.

Things change, life changes, we’re so young, no need to make a solid decision right now! Definitely not worth the burden of stress either."
tifu,fcthbz3,t3_eingyf,1577943289.0,"Keep fighting the good fight, man.

I’ve struggled with severe depression my entire life and I was also ready for an end 6 years ago when my first love left me. It hurts and it sucks, but if you allow yourself to feel all those feelings, it will help you heal, and you deserve to find happiness.

Looking back, I’m incredibly grateful that I was never successful because I’ve found my truest love and I now have all the amazing things that I wanted so bad back then.

Don’t give up on yourself - the world is a better place with you in it and your future self will thank you.

Cheers to a good year ahead and many more :)"
