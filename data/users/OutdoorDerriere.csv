Its a nice looking game and Trico your guardian friend keeps you company which is nice as sometimes likewise games can feel a bit lonely. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.

gaming,fenwrzf,t3_eq06bx,1579292045.0,"It'd not the enjoyment people get from the game... Its the shady business practices employed by the games developers. The whole game was targeted towards children, with the bright colours and awful emotes. They release limited time skins at huge prices knowing that playground peer pressure will make kids want them so badly, even so much as to steal from their parents. They pay the kids favourite steamers to pretend that they enjoy playing the game, it's all empty hype that kids cannot handle and they get sucked in, the amount of money wasted on that game is unthinkable and their sales model and tactics of taking advantage of children is deplorable."

The decision making and project management in that company has to be some of the worst going. They must be using 1979 development methodologies.

Vermintide is one of the most fun games around.  But the management have burned it to the ground.

It's a shame because the physics are great in this game, so clearly there are good devs there, the company is just rotten to the core with lies and bad decisions from the higher ups.
