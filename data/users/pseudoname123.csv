college,ferqw1w,t1_ferq5u9,1579357312.0,"FWIW I study engineering and computer science because I like to create. I've had a job waiting for me since my sophomore year (since I'm funded by my would-be employer) and enjoy going to hackathons and stuff. It's hard and industry trends largely informs the courses I take (in terms of languages and skills to learn, etc), and what some people forget is that certain technologies that we learn in our freshman year might be obsolete or outdated by the time senior year comes around. But it's a major that every field benefits from, whether it's health, agriculture, foreign policy and international affairs, and even art and design."

college,fcracno,t3_eikm6m,1577899075.0,"Friendly reminder: not all professors are males, one, and two, don't ask this professor that you're worried about for recommendations. Also take the following with a grain of salt:

> Can a professor or school leave comments on your transcripts 

No. Professors don't even have access to transcripts

> Like if a professor doesn’t like you, can he mess up your job prospects / future? 

Yes, but not because of a transcript. They can screw up your chances if they have a powerful name and/or also work in industry (but teach on the side). For instance, if you go to a uni and have Professor A who happens to be the director at some company down the street, and you apply to that company for an internship, they will likely see your name/application. So just don't apply to that company.

> Also what exactly is a transcript?

Generally it's list of grades that is automatically generated. Professors cannot see your other grades, so they therefore cannot see your transcript (at least in the USA, because of privacy concerns).

> And if a professor doesn’t like you and wants to mess up your future, there’s nothing he can do outside of the school (I.e. giving you bad grades, badmouthing you , etc) right?

They can definitely screw up your future but I don't think it can happen in ways that you're thinking of. At grad level, for instance, I've heard of PIs and profs taking credit for their grad students' work, bad-mouthing them to their colleagues at peer institutions or conferences, etc. At the undergrad level (and grad), they can also turn you in if you, say, cheated/plagiarized. Head over to r/gradschool for some of these horrible [but rare] stories. 

> He has no power to decide whether you can get a job or not right?

If they're high up in the chain, yes, but it's rare. Just don't apply to that company or hint that you took their class."
college,fcr7c7b,t1_fcqx0da,1577897827.0,"It’s not a full semester (it’s a winter intercession course, so like 3-4 weeks only). Still intensive but as /regxswan mentions, it’ll go by quickly"

onebag,fcqwq61,t1_fcqulhd,1577893378.0,good point! have you ever been questioned at security or the gate? how will they know?
college,fcqwawu,t3_eih4bb,1577893188.0,"1. on one hand, remember that this is only a winter intercession. is it worth biting the bullet for like 3 weeks? i personally think so. but on the other, winter classes are intensive af.

2. Work on your school stuff during your internship. I am an older full-time student AND have a full-time office job (no kids or family), and the trick to balancing both is to work on your school work at your job. You're never going to have enough time to separate the two so they're going to have to bleed into each other sometimes.

3. i took 3 film classes in in my first year and they were all easy, but economics is a pain. it's not a subject that you can coast by with, and you have to do the reading to grasp those concepts. also, economics is like learning a foreign language: you need the foundation to succeed in the subsequent courses. you also need time to watch/study the movies after hours, right? remember to block out at least 1.5 hours outside of class for that."
IndustrialDesign,fcqtxpu,t3_eiir3f,1577892150.0,"I study computer science and art since my university doesn't have a PD/ID major (aka I'm a complete noob to this field). Thanks for your help!

* What makes one more competitive: having products in a portfolio that they're good at, or a range of different things that they're at? (ie if I want to be a bag designer, should I have lots of bags, or a variety of different products)? In other words, would it be better to hire the person who speaks Spanish well only, or the person who speaks Spanish, Mandarin, French, and Arabic well?


* How much creativity do you personally have at your company versus when you started (either out of college or when you first transitioned into the field)? I imagine creating prototypes for doorknobs or pencil holders getting old and unexciting after awhile, so do you ever pitch in ideas that YOU personally care about?


* What's the fine line between designing something that's fit for a PD/ID-er versus an engineer? Are you ever tasked with designing something that makes you think, ""This is better for an engineer, why am I doing this?""


* What are some criterions that I should consider when looking for an ID/PD program graduate? Conversely, do you personally think a grad degree is useful (my background is computing)?


* What are *your* top 3 [general] grad programs for PD/ID?

* What rendering/design software do you personally think noobs should start learning now?

* How sensitive is this field to trends and business needs? How do they fit in this industry (or in your experience)? Like academics, does your design firm depend on grants?"
gradadmissions,fcpff1q,t3_eid9yc,1577861602.0,"> If I don’t get accepted, is it ok to reapply?

yes it's ok but make sure you have a clear gameplan that 1) warrants a second application and 2) convinces UCF that you have new and competitive stats (ie you're not just showing the same info from your first application)

> do grad schools look at second time applicants?

all da time

> is there any problem applying close to the admissions deadline?

depends on the school (ie rolling vs round 1-3, etc)"
