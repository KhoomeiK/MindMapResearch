AmItheAsshole,fdeehtu,t3_ekwwcq,1578337270.0,"NTA â€” you have no obligation to appease a man who treats you like trash. I am in the same boat with my step-father, heâ€™s been around since I was 7, but has never been a father/fatherly to me or my siblings. Any rare time he spoke to us was yelling or berating. We have told our mom we donâ€™t care about him but she says that he loves us and we just have to understand he doesnâ€™t â€œshow it rightâ€. How can you understand that he loves you if he has never spoken to you or treated you like he does? Your mom has known for years and expects you to get over it but thatâ€™s not how things work. Iâ€™m glad you had your uncle around as a good figure. Your wedding, your life, your choices."
AmItheAsshole,fdec6w0,t3_ekvuna,1578335831.0,"NTA â€” your feelings are valid. Unless thereâ€™s more info on why he didnâ€™t invite you, not wanting to start a fight with your mom isnâ€™t a good enough reason in my opinion. He got married to a new woman and there are other kids, in your 14 year old eyes it can be seen that he is abandoning you for a new family. He has apologized many times but you have no obligation to forgive him for something that hurt you that badly. Not inviting him to the wedding altogether seems petty, you still have a relationship with him so him going is normal, but itâ€™s your choice who walks you down the aisle."
