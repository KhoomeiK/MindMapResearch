Second, all you need to make a baby is to let someone cum inside you (make and raise are to really different things)

So yeah be proud, keep dreaming big and remember, those people judging you are going to be watching you on tv living your best life, and they are going to be changing diapers and listening to crying babies

Pd: english is not my first language sorry"
relationships,fdzejev,t3_encilj,1578789464.0,"Even if i do believe that your boyfriend didn't brought up the subject properly, i do understand where he is coming from. I'm in a monogamous relationship with my boyfriend, we have been together for 2 years and we love eachother very deeply, is my first serious relationship and sometimes i feel trapped because i would like to experiment with other people but he is not confortable with the idea and i respect it because i'm commited with our relationship, and commitment sometimes means sacrifice"
Anxiety,fds6gds,t3_emqkb5,1578695423.0,"My boyfriend is ansious too but i think i doesn't compare to how bad mine gets, he can function normally while ansious i can't, and he doesn't feels the ansious every day but i do, some days worse some better.

Any advice on that?"
askwomenadvice,fdqgtwd,t3_emfscx,1578666319.0,"Ignore those comments, NO ONE can force you to have children and the only two people that have a say in if you should or should'nt get the surgery is you and your doctor. Do not have a baby to please your family because you will be bitter for the rest pf your life.

I'm turning 21 tomorrow and i don't want children for a huge number of reasons and i don't think i'll ever change my mind, but if you do change your mind let it be your choice and only yours"
entitledparents,fdoe486,t3_em8t9g,1578603442.0,"Just for context, how old is the child?"
TrueOffMyChest,fdo6m2u,t3_embdtr,1578599795.0,"I partially disagree on this, for a lot people their weeding is chaotic and stressful but it also is the best day of their lives because they get to celebrate their love with the people they care the most.

But what i do agree is that they bride and groom cannot impose an amount of money to be spend, when my aunt got married she and the groom payed for all the dresses (custom made) and the rent of of the tuxes, after all weddings are supposed to be a day to share not to show of how much you spend.

Talk to the bride and explain her that this do not fit your budget and you can still go as a regular guest."
Anxiety,fdnxxac,t3_emb5oj,1578595097.0,"Yes this happens to me all the time, the i understand it that when you are anxious your body is in constant alert and this consumes a lot of energy, but when the anxiety starts to fade you are left feeling like you have ran a marathon"

Anxiety,fdip33k,t1_fdiocg2,1578447863.0,"That reminded me of something, my boyfriend once told me that doing really simple things help, washing your face drinking really cold water, felling textures, this kinda resets your brain to ""go back to reality"""
Anxiety,fdinw42,t3_eljud3,1578447098.0,"To me it starts with a pit in my stomach, then i feel numb and after that everything feels off, like my body is not mine, or that i was put in a reality similar to mine but there are things that are not rigth, my body goes in auto pilot like i'm in the passanger seat in my own body. This goes away on it own after a couple minutes but sometimes it lasts hours, sometimes it makes me feel really ansious, i don't know what causes it or what can i do to prevent it, i anyone experiences the same please leave your advice"

sex,fddiwym,t3_ekt11d,1578314107.0,"Yes i can feel the difference, specially in foreplay when he is rubbing his penis on the outer labia before putting it in, and when it's inside it feels more dry when there is a condom on.

Also for me is not just about how it feels, but also is a thing about intimacy, doing it without a condom you cannot be any closer, and that makes it 10x hotter."
sex,fddij5q,t3_ekt2id,1578313684.0,"I have the same situation, my boyfriend is very touchy all the time, i like it when we are in a sexual situation but if im cooking i don't want him to grab my boobs or if im cleaning i don't wang him to put his hand between my legs, it makes me really uncomfortable, sometimes i don't want to be touch in those areas at all, and i'm not sure why.

I have told him about this but he got a little mad and he started saying that he will ask every single time he is going to touch me if that is ok, i don't want that either. I don't know what to do or if I'm being irrational here, advice is welcome"
askwomenadvice,fddha8r,t3_ekru5p,1578312230.0,"In my case i found (clean, non crying) babies adorable, i like to hold them and when they laugh i feel joy, but what makes me feel even more joy is knowing that when they start crying i can give them back to their parents, i don't want children nor now nor never for an inifite number of reasons"

unpopularopinion,fdcj5om,t1_fdcica4,1578276199.0,"Ok this a better anwser, it's ok if you don't like something for yourself, that is totally up to you, is your body your choice, and it's completly normal to ""jump"" when you see something out of the ordinary, coloured hair, piercings or scars and vitiligo, but whats never ok it's to judge a persons intellect based on their appereance, at least to my opinion 

And yes i do know that coloured hair and a scar are not the same thing, i just compared them because they are things that stand out in a person appereance, you don't seem like a bad person but maybe you should open your mind a little bit more"

unpopularopinion,fdceuin,t3_ekl5w5,1578273171.0,"Yeah totally makes sense because having blue hair immediately removes a college degree, and a piercing immediately takes away 10 years of experience, you are so right"
sex,fdcd4yy,t3_ekjkrm,1578272004.0,"When it's the first time you are going to do something always ask, it's better to be safe than sorry, also remember that consent it's also about body language, if a girl removes your hands from centain part of her body or if she drifts aways, then she is not comfortable, and that's the moment when you should stop and ask her if there is something wrong"
childfree,fdcc4sx,t3_ekif88,1578271355.0,"Also parents stop caring about a lot of things, toddler wants to pee? They can pee on the street, baby needs diaper change?

AskReddit,f8qpv29,t3_e1n3cb,1574721578.0,"I´m not 100% against guns as much as i am 100% pro control, to own a gun you should go through a psychological exam, and then if you pass it you could own a gun, and this should be an exam that should be done once a year to renew the licence to own a fire arm, this licence should only incluide only self defense weapons, there is not a single reason why a civilian should own an ak47 or anything like that, yes people can get guns illegally but at least this would make it a little bit harder."
