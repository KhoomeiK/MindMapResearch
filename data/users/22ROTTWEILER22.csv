Pets,ffa7van,t3_es96xp,1579729591.0,Cats shouldn’t be forced to bond with people- it won’t work. Her trying to force it will make it worse. Hopefully she realizes that she’s going to mess the cat over. Good luck.
AskVet,ffa6sb4,t3_eshzy2,1579728987.0,"Not a vet but honestly, if you’re dog is happy, they shouldn’t be put to sleep. Dogs act different at the vet than when they’re at their home. It sounds like your dog has been through a lot but if she can still be happy and isn’t suffering, putting her down would not be my go to. I mean if she’s always going to have to suffer through that then I’d try to look at ways to improve her quality of life, but if she is still young (which she is) and still able to be happy, then i would try everything to see what works and only put her down as a last resort"

Even so, he did a horrible job and he should’ve had to buy us stuff to clean our carpets. I really wish that we would’ve called his parents but somehow we must’ve gotten busy and forgotten or something. I still want to call his parents, even if it’s been a long time, because I’m still super mad about it and he shouldn’t just get away with it."
dogs,ff313w6,t3_erdezp,1579530873.0,To me it looks like a collie and a husky but very likely that there would be more breeds. You can’t be completely sure without a DNA test though

Dogtraining,ff2cjic,t3_er7r1j,1579500726.0,Has he done it for the whole time that you’ve had him? How old abouts is your sister? Also what breed/s is he
HayDay,ff23nmv,t3_er74sg,1579492917.0,"Personally, I’d say fishing. It’s a lot more interactive as well"
Pets,ff211d2,t3_er3bdw,1579490933.0,I personally would not give him to a shelter as they have very high euthanasia rates. Posting that you have found a cat would be a much better option for the cat. If it is well fed it could very well be a pet or it could be possible that someone else is providing food as well. I’d also suggest looking out for missing cat ads. Good luck!
EdmontonOilers,ff0eskm,t3_eqz4ei,1579468225.0,We were there last night and it was super funny when they announced that

We had someone come let our dog (a very anxious Chihuahua / Mini Pinscher who we believe was abused before we got him) out while we were gone for a weekend. I was very reluctant to let them come since they’re someone I disliked. Anyways, we come back and the dogs had peed everywhere, it seemed like he had come like once or twice. Already pretty stupid. Then I’m on the bus to school and I hear him bragging about how he kicked our dog because he had tried to pet our dog and our dog snapped (which is expected because he is anxious and is scared of people). After hearing that I was super mad. A few years later and I still hate that kid."

dogs,fel19dj,t3_epi99u,1579211883.0,"To be honest, his best chance it to stick with you. If he is rehomed there is a small chance he could find someone that would be good, but that isn’t super likely. In this situation, it sounds like it was your parents fault. If they knew he didn’t like dogs and let the puppy go near him multiple times, that’s on them. If dogs are dog-aggressive or dog-reactive, they shouldn’t be around other dogs. The puppy, by the sounds of it, probably was trying to play or meet him- which is not the puppy’s fault- it’s excited. Is there any way you could take your dog to your house and keep him there? Do your parents seem to want to put your dog down?"
dogs,fekyqvn,t1_fek34tl,1579210386.0,Exactly. It makes me really angry to think that they got a puppy after this dog was around AND are upset that their puppy got attacked.
AskVet,feipnse,t3_epbni8,1579144105.0,Not a vet but I know that small dogs carrying the puppies (being the mother) is a horrible idea and they can die due to birth complications (likely because the puppies are too big for her body).

Pets,fdilsce,t1_fdck67l,1578445752.0,Yeah I know it’s just you can look out for animals without suddenly making accusations with very little context.
AskVet,fdilk49,t1_fdhj421,1578445605.0,Ah have you thought about taking them for separate walks possibly? And maybe taking him to a more grassy area or path that would be less harsh on his paws?
Pets,fdcjqkg,t1_fdc1a8s,1578276614.0,"I get what you mean but people need to stop assuming everything. I mean in your situation, that’s a fair assumption, as they’re all running around without anyone seeming to care. But the fact that the person was walking their dog (which is already a good thing) and keeps getting accused isn’t fair. The dog is likely being cared for if it’s being taken for walks and the owner literally had a fair explanation. I mean some people definitely don’t take things far enough, but I’m this situation, it’s too far. And if it was just respectful concern for the dog, that is completely fine, although it seems like the people are immediately making unfair accusations."
Pets,fdcj0px,t3_ekfkhj,1578276101.0,"I would say get a written letter signed by your vet and use that as proof. If they don’t believe that and call animal control, then get the animal control people to call your vet. Some people sadly don’t realize that some dogs literally cannot gain weight no matter what."

RandomKindness,fd528tr,t3_ek0i8i,1578173551.0,My advice is that to teach them that other living things have feelings and emotions as well. It helps to be able to both understand and sympathize with others.

rant,fcyzp3p,t3_ejlais,1578090662.0,I agree. So many people say that there has to be a war while they just sit back and relax. Why should people be risking their life if they don’t have to? War should be a last resort- nobody should have to go and fight just to die because nobody was willing to try to solve problems another way. It’s sad how many people don’t think of the lives that are just thrown away when they don’t have to be.

I mean it’s easier to just keep it in your locker during class to be honest. And during exams you have to give your phone to the office and you can go get it after you’re finished writing.
