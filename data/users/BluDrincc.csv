harrypotter,fe99z95,t3_enrq6a,1578935706.0,"What is the internet's obsession with Luna? I feel like she isn't that much of a big character but she's more popular than Hermione! Is it because she's different? Also if you're going to repost at least crop properly. I honestly think Luna's a bit scary (sorry if you're offended), because of how mysterious she is."
books,fe97pha,t3_eo0bcx,1578935087.0,"Yeah, fiction books haven't been good the past few years so just pick whatever you want. I love history so much and recently have started preferring non-fiction. If you haven't read Harry Potter I highly recommend reading that, some people get so into it that even after they finish they join Pottermore and look at fanart and fan-fiction, it's not what I did but it's a life-changing page-turner. If you've read Harry Potter just look around for books, ""Playlist for the dead"", is a great book if you don't mind an occasional bad word (like 1 bad word every 70 pages). Maybe stray from the mage and magic books and do realistic fiction, those I enjoy a lot if I find a good book."
