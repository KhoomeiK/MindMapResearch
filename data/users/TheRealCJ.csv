UpliftingNews,ff54mhl,t1_ff50c6l,1579580097.0,"In Australia the government has a ""work for the dole"" program similar to this for people on new start (unemployment)

just how bad this program is came to light recently, when many volunteer firefighters were unable to fulfil their new start duties (working x amount of hours, sending in x number of job applications, etc) because they were busy doing 14 hour shifts fighting the horrifying bushfires, so they had their only source of income cut."
discworld,ff545rr,t1_ff4rpvl,1579579727.0,"the whole premise of the show feels like they took the entirely wrong end of the stick. Crime isn't ""legal"" in AM because it's a purge-like grimdark hellhole, it's because the unionised guilds have been so effective at controlling unsanctioned crimes that the watch had become almost entirely vestigial, with the palace guard and dark clerks doing most the crime fighting work that fell out of the guilds' jurisdiction.

in fact, the only reason it became what it was in later books was because of carrots unbridled enthusiasm and lack of nuance regarding the Realpolitik of the city, and the fact that Vimes & Co. were the only ones who were able to save Vetinari."
discworld,ff53d0p,t1_ff45t0s,1579579110.0,"overall it skews darker than almost all of the discworld books, but at the same time it also is only one out of over 30 books, and it still remains hopeful and with set pieces that aren't pure grimdark."
discworld,ff44igs,t1_ff3v09o,1579555360.0,"Nah, this isn't like Game of Thrones. This is more like those CW shows where they're trying super hard to turn a previously jovial work into a grimdark and ""realistic"" drama."

discworld,ff3b92b,t1_ff39sfy,1579537796.0,"Honestly? I feel like Discworld falls into Hope Punk more than anything. Even when protagonists and minor characters die, there's an air of optimism about it, with a kindly death ushering them into the next life. I rarely read even his darkest books like Night Watch dreading to discover what happens on the next page."
discworld,ff38h84,t1_ff37v2f,1579536176.0,"I think it was originally intended to be a police procedural set in the discworld universe, so not based on any one book but more of an original story featuring the characters from the Watch books.

from what I've read of the final product coming out this year it seems like it's going to be a long story arc based very loosely on *Night Watch*, but mostly it seems like it's gonna be a generic grimdark series about police and vigilantes fighting to change the system of am unjust world etc. etc."

Like Dibbler being a woman? that's totally fine to me, being an irreputable purveyor of dubious foodstuffs is not gender-dependant. The issue I have is that her character (Who is simply named ""Throat"") is described as ""The City's best snitch, with a  gang of freelance henchmen at her beck and call""

Likewise with Sybil Ramkin, she's now a violent vigilante fighting crime on the mean streets"
discworld,ff336w7,t3_er790b,1579532497.0,"I would highly recommend reading them in chronological order.

I'm not going to tell anyone they're to blame."
discworld,ff2tdmi,t1_fezfxcs,1579523361.0,"Way to miss the point. Did you ever notice through the whole series vimes does his best not to kill, to diffuse situations, to avoid violence as much as possible. Discworld is dark, but with hope.

Home come I get the feeling in the first episodes we'll see the protagonists kill in cold blood?"
discworld,ff2taf7,t1_ff2gyp3,1579523251.0,"People keep saying Discworld is dark and Gritty, and frankly it's offensive. Yes, it has dark themes, but it's a *satire* first and foremost. It holds up a skewed mirror to the real world, which means that it can be dark. Yes it can be Gritty, but it is also hopeful, even Night Watch, the darkest of the watch books, had an air of hope around it, there was always a sunrise just on the horizon. 

So far this show looks like it's just going to be another grimdark show that has little to no levity, where everything is shit and attempts to make things less shit requires a person to be just as shit as the situation they're trying to change. Can you imagine a show like this having a scene where Vimes takes A. E. Pessimal around to a bunch of different characters who joke around with him? Can you imagine a grimdark world where the solution to an oncoming gang war is to get both sides so drunk they can't move? Can you imagine this show having a moment where dark and Gritty vimes sits down in front of a brightly lit watch house and diffuses an angry mob? 

I'm reserving my final judgement until I see at least the first couple of episodes, but given they've made one of *the* most optimistic and gentle characters in the entire series, Lady Sybil, into a hard fighting murderous vigilante, I'm not holding out hope."
