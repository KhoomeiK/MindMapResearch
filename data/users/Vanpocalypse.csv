""Satan, why is there only two genders that are accepted by consensus society despite scientific evidence showing that gender is a spectrum?""

""That's a toughy man, well for starters consensus society isn't all in agreement on scientific discoveries.  Some dingdongs still think the world is flat (thanks for that one too, God.), and others think vaccines will make them even stupider than they already are, truly a funny thing, but when it comes to gender approval, there's a deeply ingrained belief in the value of ones birth right.  Society doesn't want to admit in many areas that it is afraid of the power of freedom of choice, to be as you desire to be, or that dreams can be fulfilled.  No, you see, society is built to consume, not support.  The dreams of being how you feel, that's a danger to the ideal of consumption.  You can't just not consume the propaganda on every song, commercial, and show in existence that tells you you're yourself at birth and will never change.  They don't get that science has given people a chance to transition, or to at least find mental help for their feelings of depression brought on by great disbelief on ones own circumstances.  Rather they'd have you fall to your knees and throw money at God and beg for help while silence is your only answer then shame you for wanting to kill yourself to escape the thought prison they've erected all around you.

It's very important to disconnect from consensus society when you start chasing your dreams or aim for goals that are still met with unease and discrimination by most people.  It's also important if you want to support such people as society thinks the strong must eat the weak, but realistically if society is to survive, the strong must protect the weak, as seen in the military forces that risk their lives for others sake, or in firefighters, paramedics, officers when they're not diagnosed sociopathic psychopaths, and such.  It's important to remember that we're only as strong as our weakest link's *protection*.  Without that protection, we'd be eating each other within weeks.

The power of freedom of choice is paramount, the penultimate means to attaining mostly anything you realistically could achieve, with the ultimate means being actually choosing consistently to do so.  Society is threatened by this, it wants everyone to be an insect in its colony, but you're all so much more, seeking ever greater evolutions to life and fulfillment.  Never let society tell you what's what if it isn't backed up by accrual research compared to plain mass opinion, for opinions, especially en mass are often ignorant.  Research seeks the truth, and while it isn't always right, its power is to admit when it is wrong than pulling some mental acrobatics to stubbornly ignorantly explain why it's right despite having been proved wrong and to continue seeking what is right than can be continually verified as true.  Now that too obviously is a rigid method of going about things and also no field is free of corrupt influences by society's fat stacks of money, which may explain why so many don't trust in science as a practice rather than to just doubt certain things.  As such it ultimately comes down to an us vs them mentality which ironically is what society wanted all along so we focus on each others flaws than society's flaws.  Don't fall for this, the actuality is that it isn't anyone versus anyone, these are far deeply ingrained ideals taught by society for as long as rich motherfuckers have funded society.  We're all in this together, if you identify as a they or a he or a she or as nothing or whatever it is, that's your feelings, they matter, they're important, because you all matter and you're all important, and society would strip that away from you and have you just fit another mould of its divisive nature of control.  Don't let society seperate you from yourself.  Be yourself, and be deaf to the sneers of society, blind to their obscene feelings, and mute to their discrimination, only you can do you, no one else has that right to say what you do is right for you.  I believe in all of you, and also, God sucks and this is all his fault.  Next question?"""

The Enterprise and most Federation ships (assuming Klingons as well) have two backups for most of their integral systems.  A secondary and tertiary backup for an inertial dampener, the thing that keeps them all from going splat during warp speed and impulse accelerations and decelerations would probably have those backups, *however*, they do break the importance of such a device by making it seem like, whenever it's 'down' they all feel the force of momentum which stops them from moving.  Which might be explainable for their non-splattered status by saying the gravity plating in the floors also exerts a force that keeps them tethered to the ground, and the continual momentum of the ship matches their own, but realistically light speeds would splatter a starship crew if at any point the inertial dampeners stopped working at accelerating or deceleration.

Also, all stop relative to the nearest object, they're probably technically adrift at an all stop if you consider that space itself is always expanding, but relative to their section of the sector they've charted in relationship to their speedometer, which as an instrument in lieu with a super computer, could probably determine when the ships engines decelerate it to a full stop under 1km/h since, in space, meters are kinda small measurements when you have hundreds of thousands of meters of empty space all around you.

WitchesVsPatriarchy,fez7iqd,t1_feyvwoy,1579454489.0,"I like to joke I've withered to a transcendental point, like an undead being that skipped death.  Every point has a counter, every thing has an exception.  You can only wilt so much before you appear dead, imagine their surprise when you still blossom while wilted.  Some strive in the light, like leaves and flowers, while others thrive in the dark, like roots and seeds.  It really isn't my place to judge such natures or nature itself.

However I am conflicted by the nature of nature itself.  How badly I want to stop the circle of life and end the feeding of death and suffering with physical life.  The irony and paradox being to end life's suffering, life must cease to be sufferable, and suddenly everyone thinks life will be boring and pointless and not worthwhile, the beauty of the struggle lost, the growth from resistance gone.  I don't mind such things, if we're all eternal souls then what is the rush, why the impatience?  Is it competition?  I really don't know.

I just think, that...There are horrible things in life that exist because of pain and suffering, and are caused by things like apathy and selfishness.  Throughout history torture has been used.  Throughout history pain has been used.  They are said to be tools but for what dark purpose were they crafted in our reality?  Where a tool can be used to fix and break things, is the hammer inherently evil for its potential capability to smash someone's skull into viscera?  Or is it good for its potential capacity to build a home and put a roof over someone's head instead?  Is the rain cloud evil for its potential to flood a field, or good for its potential to water the crops?

To me nothing and everything isn't as it seems.  There are paradoxes everywhere.  To wither is to grow.  To grow is to wither.  Even balance is imbalance, for in an Infinite creation all things exist, even a perfectly balanced imbalance.

Pain begets pleasure, madness begets satisfaction.  Sorrow begets happiness.  For every withered plant, their loss made room for another to eventually grow and potentially prosper.  Life and death aren't so different, and trying to tend to ones self can still be harmful if you over prune or over water yourself.  Balancing the act doesn't necessarily lead to a bountiful growth either.

Imho we all have paths we must take, or have already choosen to take without knowing it.  That lead us to our unique journeys that are tailored ultimately to provide us the means to gain or lose our very selves.  Whether we wither or prosper is a mere consequence of how we handle ourselves on that journey.

Because it isn't about what we want or need, it's about what we do.  We have a choice, the power to deduce, deliberate, decide, we have free will to be or not to be certain ways.

For some, a life of prosperity is one of poverty, for others a life of misery is one of luxury.  They never know until they end up there.  Rock bottom, end of the line, top of the tower, the endless journey.  Life is a mystical mysterious novel, and not even the protagonist knows what they need to make it into a good story.  That so many are lucky and stumble upon what they need to know to be happy is a blessing for them and a curse for all those others who are lost.

I too hope you will find the circumstances that you require to grow and prosper into a beautiful life where when the petals of your self blossom, they can reveal the nectar of your soul to waft among the world around you with the sweet scent of happiness."

WitchesVsPatriarchy,feymu6w,t1_fexppsx,1579447703.0,"Omg I can answer this as a crazy person who followed some crazy things.

Imagine if you will, the reincarnated soul.  It doesn't blindly reincarnate (usually).  It chooses what life to live, typically based on what lessons it is ready and willing to learn and offer to others.

Now imagine if you will, what a soul who chooses to reincarnate as someone who will be sex trafficked at a young age has to learn as their lessons.

A somewhat...less daunting thing to imagine is a soul who reincarnates into a life as a child who will ultimately end up dying of cancer by age 8.  Why would a soul take up such a life, and make it possible?  What are the lessons of love and wisdom in such a short life?  What does it teach to those affected by it, perhaps that life is precious, and fleeting, and should be embraced and cherished before it is gone?

Then what would a soul that's living a life as a sex trafficked child have for lessons?  Maybe it's a karmic situation, where a soul of a child rapist in a previous reincarnation becomes a sex trafficked child to face the consequences for their actions.

Maybe it's an exceptionally brave and resilient soul looking for a challenging situation to break free of or die trying.

You don't find the spiritual equivalent to Creator and live in blissful peaceful contentness from 2014-2015 only to end up feeling utterly like a complete pos, trash, and like you mean less than nothing and deserve no love at all and feel like you deserve to suffer for all of your failures and shortcomings if you don't lack certain foundations of self love.  All the universe's love won't be able to patch up those holes in your soul, it will try its best if you let it, but there's only one being in existence who knows you good enough to permanently patch those holes, and it's yourself.

That so many of us were never given the tools to do so by those whose jobs it was to equip us with the means to provide to ourselves self love, is truly a travesty that's left portions of entire groups of people empty and hollow inside.

All part of the 'big plan' they say, but truthfully, the reality is no one is going to help us, we're on our own sometimes, it's a test to see how good we've gotten at loving ourselves.  Failing isn't a pass/fail one time deal kind of thing, there's always tomorrow, until the day you die.

It can seem cruel, and ironically detached and unloving, but it's how we find ourselves.  That doesn't make it right, but it is what it is.  No one can ever fix the torn pieces of another's heart and soul, the best we could ever do for another is offer them support in loving themselves, and helping them get back at patching up the holes instead of letting them just give up and wither away.

Cause let's be honest, giving up and withering away is so simple.  It isn't easy, but it is simple.  It isn't hard to do either, you just go with the bad thoughts and feelings, when you think you deserve to suffer, you don't fight it.  When you feel that the pain inside of you from that emptiness in your heart is overwhelming you just curl up and suffer.  It's so simple to just shrivel back into an inconsequential meaningless speck of life on a speck of rock orbiting a speck of fire, it's not easy remembering that our souls *are* taller than the shadows they cast, and that every *'speck'* of being in this cosmos isn't inconsequential, but a potential to become so much more.

It's a sad truth but you can't analyze that pain when you're the recipient, sometimes all you can do is say they're just abusive unfortunately.  For some girls that becomes synonymous to he's just a man unfortunately, no differently from how a ton of guys end up saying the same thing about girls that hurt them, but no one gives them shit for their misogyny, but a misandrogynist comment by a girl and suddenly *she's the sexist*...

That we can love one another is a miracle to me.  One I cherish so much that I'm appalled by how hard it is to love each other by life and nature's (and by extension, soul's) design.  It isn't merely barbaric, its grotesque.

Oh wait, you didn't realize I was leading you on?  Seems to be a theme with a lot of people lately, following others blindly leading them on.  I'm just 'a clown' and I did a good job, not that it was very hard.  How 'a leader' must lead you on to some crazy places must be a walk in the park for them.

Real talk though bro, I genuinely, as in actually literally, do not understand why this action was made.  Why did we kill this seemingly important government figure in another country?  I want to hear your thoughts on it, we danced the insult dance, let's sit down and have a drink now.  Give me some koolaid, or whatever people call what others consider information.

I'll even start.  I've read some headlines and articles, the guy was apparently a big wig intelligence guy in the Iranian government, who apparently headed or coordinated an attack on the US Embassy over there, and so we took him out as a terrorist.  On the other hand I've read that he was assassinated as a means to retaliation against the US in some politically convoluted plan by Trump to get back at our government for impeaching him.

I personally don't know, I try not to subscribe to either side but hear the whole picture, specifically because consider this, if this guy that was killed was a genuine threat to the US's safety, and his death was a genuine attempt to protect the country, yet his opponents spun it like he threw a temper tantrum for being impeached, wouldn't that look bad on the people spinning it?  Though the flipside is if they're right, wouldn't that look bad on him?

I just want to know what the truth was, journalism doesn't really seem to get down to that conclusion as a whole, each place spins it a certain way.  I wanna know what really happened.  What do you think really happened?

I'm seriously asking.  Cause all I think is let's take action towards peace, and now I get that such action sometimes involves blowing people up who are bad people that want to hurt what you hold dear and love, I just want to make sure the result leads more towards peace and not retaliation, which does complicates the entire foreign peace picture we like to imagine our diplomats and government's maintain so we don't all nuke each other in apocalyptic apotheosis.

If your only reality is an illusion then illusion is a reality.  -Fear

Dreams, hallucinations, projections, manifestations, waking life, what is and isn't really real?

I personally believe in the manifestation idea.  It allows for ideas, concepts, and thoughts to take form.  We manifest a story with our minds.  Others manifests buildings with their hands.  Some manifest life events with their actions.  Children manifest drawings with crayons, it's very simple to the point it's complex, because imo reality is a paradox.

Humans can figure it out, the problem is we aren't really meant to, not unless you like being crippled by constant realization that life is just a projection and nothing we do really matters because it was going to be done anyway.  Eternally speaking, existence is a play put on by a creator, creation is a playground to learn upon.  Concepts are theories.  Facts are opinions.  And even the one Truth is a veil to be seen through because eternity implies infinity, and in infinity there is ALWAYS another layer, another realm, another plane to be discovered, taken in, purified by its very discovery, then left behind.  The known and forgotten, the unknown and discovered, creator is a singularity that is all these things yet is also not, distorting itself to be unrecognizable, forgetting itself to be once again recovered, like a long forgotten memory resurfacing.

It is a travesty that physical life is merely a tool, that the all-knowing knows that it also does not know.

To me, existence isn't really something to be explored, it is a nightmare, reflected in our very reality.  The only good that is to come was always there, forsaken by our desires to be more or less.  That unconditional love can spawn hell, that too much order can be chaotic, to me it points to a zero-sum game of balance with no right or wrong ending, just another lesson, that upon being manifested to be learned had the consequences of suffering and despair, because the creator is detached from the creation despite being the creation.  No one comes to save a physical life being murdered, only their soul goes on.  The play that was that life ends.  So it is, as it has been and will be.  One form of creation is a tool to enlighten another form.  We're all being used, we're all the users.  Only our souls get to go on, we fade to dust and disappear while we move on to a new adventure.

No, to me, the idea of existence as we know it is a fallacy.  There's only one thing, it is as much a Lover as it is a Monster, because it is all things.  Just look out at life.  We consume to subsist.  We destroy to create and create to destroy.  The circle of life is hellish, unless you think dying isn't a loathsome experience full of pain and suffering and loss, or that birth isn't a similarly painful experience.

I know that the afterlife is a place of healing, I will never know why it was ever okay for such horrible things to occur though.  When you look closely enough, you better not care.  Or you'll end up permanently repeating this cycle called physical life until you don't.  That's the game.  That's our life.  We're told we're here to better learn to love, that physical life is a school on learning how to better love, while we genocide and judge others of our own species, while we use and abuse others we claim to love.  While we suffer for our kind actions while evil people live luxuriously.  We're told it's a hard school, difficult courses and lessons, while the ones teaching don't dare to venture to our realm to see us in the flesh.

Spirituality is terrifying, existence is outright monstrous.  Yet we don't go up in protest as a collective, the ones that do are shamed and invalidated and ostracized despite being allowed to go back.

If there were ever to be one thing, it would have to be infinity, above all else, unity is implied in a coherent infinity that doesn't completely destroy itself.  If a unified infinity is that one thing.  There better be a damn good reason places and situations such as our world's exist at all, and they better be damn well worth it.

Cause if not, something will change it, one way or another.  Even our history points to that conclusion, even astronomy can't deny that enough mass leads to a singularity.  The entire universe follows patterns and themes.  Gravitational clumping, electromagnetic shielding, geometrically derived patterns, spirals and fractals of a perpetuated concept.

Eventually you'll end up with some 'beings' of sentient consciousness who look outwardly instead of inwardly and proclaim horror at the situation.  I think hellish NDE's are a symptom of this, of looking out and calling out the nightmare that is present yet deemed acceptable.  Our worldly situation isn't acceptable, we're devastating an entire planet of life out of greed and apathy.  Of course you'd get people with hellish nde's screaming at them saying something is wrong.  Something *IS* wrong, and they're the ones who are going to be sharing that hell with everyone else until we collectively decide, as beings on sentient consciousness, to no longer perpetuate 'spiritual schools' of hellish design intended to cause suffering to push towards greater understandings of love.

The entire thing is a testament to the massive disconnect between creator and creation and the hypocrisy of the spiritual schools curriculum, using physical life to gain spirituality as eternal beings at the loss physically had by mortal beings.  Sure they wouldn't exist without souls manifesting them to begin with, but they also wouldn't suffer the permanence of loss unlike eternal souls that can go back and relive any life at any time in their divinely capable being.

In fact it goes to say a lot that timeless beings must use mortal life to further themselves spirituality at the physical's loss.  Beings of unconditional love wouldn't be doing that.

Life is a balancing game to sort out the good enough from the rest of us.  It goes on eternally as an obstacle towards greater levels of existence.

You don't read into all of this stuff and eventually end up blissfully aware, the opposite occurs, you grow detached, uncaring, love is just another tool for activity just like hate.

Existence becomes a game that is played for rapid growth, at the great loss of billions of unique tangible lifeforms for billions of unique intangible lifeforms to subsist upon, by those intangible beings' own design without the tangible beings' consent.  Treated like empty shells, vehicles left to their owner's/soul's devices, the shell doesn't matter, the essence does.  That's why we're all suffering, we aren't actually cared about, we're abused for the sake of a timeless eternal being.

That hellish things and worst things (wars) exist is a testament to that.

A true unconditionally loving actual infinite creator wouldn't do those things, it's ignorant detached lower emanations would.

So it shouldn't come as any surprise that so many souls would partake in these hellish places to get out of this level of creation as quickly as possible.  We're all climbing for the light, instead of bringing it here, now.  It's infinite, it can reach us, we simply don't know it and refuse to acknowledge it when a sliver of it shines through trying to find and help us.  We're all tricked by darkness for even existing in these places to begin with.

It's so simple it comes off as complicated, but it isn't, we're the ones complicating it so we can continue to refuse and deny what we claim to be seeking.

Gather some guild cards from people, select a tailraider safari group with high hunting potential (red paws) and send them after any route with the most of those three monsters in it.

If you ever need research points go on expeditions and gather as much endemic life and gathering points specific to that region (mushroom colonies in the forest as an example) as possible.

Capture monsters if you're hunting them for the first time, it unlocks optional quests for that monster in the special arena (which is equipped with various traps that reload, like falling boulders, dragonator, and cannons and ballistas.)

I recommend cultivating at the botanist herbs, honey, and bitterbugs starting out, then blue mushrooms and godbugs then the seeds needed to craft armorskins and demondrugs.

Always speak to the ecologist after every hunt where you level up ecological research.  At the highest research level the monsters will appear on your map at the start of a hunt for it or after gathering one track from any other monster at full research level.

Use Slinger ammo that monsters drop to stun them momentarily, usually to stop an attack.  Also explore the environment as some endemic life drops slinger ammo.  Slinger ammo has various uses.  Scatternuts can stun monsters.  Torch pods get rid of effluvium.  Moss pods get rid of coated on mud on monsters.  Brightmoss has a small chance to blind a monster when hitting them in the face with it.  Also save slinger ammo to stun monsters limping away to catch up to them more easily.
