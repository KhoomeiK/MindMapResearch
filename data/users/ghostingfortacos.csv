On the other hand, they cannot resist gravity. Gravity can make their hand slide off their chest and slump off the table. That shit happens all the time and it's annoying af. Especially if you're embalming and the water is running, then their arm chub can make a dam on the table and cause a bloody water flood all over the floor. This usually happens when you aren't looking.

Also embalming is not a clean and proper process. It can be an actual shit show. 

We don't sew their eyes shut. That would really fuck up the aesthetic of the closure of the eye. We also don't sew their lips shut. We might wire their jaw shut, but not sew them up like a voodoo doll. 

Funeral directors and embalmers usually make shit for money. They're over worked and underpaid. The median hourly wage for them in Texas is $16/hour. They will try to pay them closer to $12/hr for as long as earthly possible. 

The owner takes 90% of the money on any funeral over $2k. Under 2k you're getting a bare bones package with minimal profits. The FD and emb work every other weekend, and every holiday including Christmas and Thanksgiving. So yeah, pay sucks, hours suck, and you deal with crying people, and there's a non zero chance you step in an unknown body fluid every day you work. Also, you will *FUCK* your back moving heavy people.

Funeral homes don't keep the organs or take the organs out. They don't want your nans organs ok. 

A morgue is a holding room in a hospital. A funeral home is not a morgue. A morgue is not a funeral home. These words are not interchangeable. 

There is no T in hearse. It is not Hearst. Hearst is a name. A hearse is a vehicle. No you can't put the pallbearers in it to cheap out on a limo, unless your pallbearers are the size of toddlers.

It's pall bearer, not pall burier. If you have buried the pall, the funeral director is drunk and needs to go home. 

Funeral home workers aren't necrophiliacs. That's fucking gross and people who ask that are gross too. That's like asking a vet if they fuck dogs. Just no.

There's powdered stock, but it's not like bouillon, it's chemical flavors and umami fakers in it. The wonton skin is another fake powder, that cheats the process of making hand made wonton skin.

But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her. 9 But if the slave’s owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave but as a daughter.
10 “If a man who has married a slave wife takes another wife for himself, he must not neglect the rights of the first wife to food, clothing, and sexual intimacy. 11 If he fails in any of these three obligations, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment.

Source- I have nice hand towels and I swear to god they are for hands, and not counters or wiping up tomato sauce.

Edit- I have like 4 towels in my kitchen at any moment. One is a grubby towel for cleaning spills. I hate grabbing a towel that was just used to wipe up beer and pasta sauce after washing my hands, to get gross stuff all over my just washed hands. 

Also, I have towels with designs and I don't want them to get stained. I spent good money on those and I only buy cute towels during Halloween so I cant exactly replace them at any time. Yes, my kitchen is permanently Halloween."

I live in South Texas and it makes me sad to see cactuses in almost every yard and on every corner full of them, but nobody eats them. They're good eating, they're free, and full of vitamins and fiber. There's a lot of people here who don't have a lot of money to buy fresh produce and there's these totally edible fruits growing wild everywhere. A

Also nopales are fucking lit. It's like a tender green bean. There's a restaurant near me that has them during Lent and they aren't slimy like they can be if cooked poorly.  Paddle cactus is generally consider a nuisance plant that's hard to get rid of, we could be eating it but people don't want to eat their veggies or eat ""weird food"". The locals of this region love it. It's an OG food source. They also put it in tacos and braises.
