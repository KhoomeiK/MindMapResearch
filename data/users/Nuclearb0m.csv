tifu,feiv23s,t3_ep5oe3,1579147988.0,I would've probably just walked out.
cpp,fehs92g,t3_ep1s2i,1579122852.0,"As someone who first started with C++ in college, I can say it's both incredible as a first language and also somewhat questionable. I was curious enough to work on learning memory management, undefined behavior, scope lifetimes etc. A fair amount of students simply drop out after this class though. Would they be good engineers in the end if they started with Python? I really don't know, but it's important to set the right expectations. For many people it could be a good foundational/transitionary language."
cpp,fehr4dr,t1_fehpr3z,1579122211.0,Most universities will teach Data Structures or Algorithms (or both like mine) early on and it may be important to understand how memory works for those. And most of those classes seem to use Java or C++ for the course material.

college,fcydorz,t1_fcxlakf,1578078495.0,"This is true, the CS major in most colleges teach you barely anything job related. The theory is important and if you understand it well, you can teach yourself new things(frameworks, languages, design patterns etc.) easily. But getting hired is something else on its own. Especially after the shift to Leetcode-esque style interviewing, you have to get your degree, be competent enough to convince the company you're worth it and teachable (difficulty of this depends on too many factors) AND be good at Data Structures and Algorithmic whiteboarding/questions.
