NoStupidQuestions,fcvih3k,t1_fcve1w0,1578002787.0,I'm glad to know somebody understands where I'm coming from with this. Thanks stranger!!
NoStupidQuestions,fcvi78q,t1_fcvh30f,1578002619.0,"Woahhhh, this is not the worst news I've had to break to someone. In the past I've had friends around that I could ask how I should handle this situation but that's not the case right now unfortunately. (Wow that's pitiful now that it's typed. Sorry if that sounds like I was baiting for sympathy or something.)"
FREE,fcvfdds,t3_ej1d9y,1578000931.0,I could use one. I'm curious what you'll pick if I don't tell you what I need encouragement with. Pick whatever seems to fit me!
AskWomen,fc6r8zt,t3_eg5glr,1577487446.0,"I don't understand the Alexa and Google Home type gadgets. I can do everything it does on my smartphone already if I have Siri on (which I never do but that's unrelated). Everyone who I've seen have one already has the latest smartphone so I just don't see the point in spending money on something else.

Maybe I'm not aware of some capabilities of it but from what I've seen, they're kinda pointless. To anybody that has one, what are some benefits of owning it? How has it improved your life or made things easier?"
offmychest,fc6q3bo,t3_egeiur,1577486628.0,"As someone who has been friends with guys MUCH older than me, I would advise you to be careful with your heart and not jump in too quickly with anything if he has the same feelings for you (although it is technically illegal for you to be together). I'm 16 too (almost 17) and I personally can't imagine dating someone so much older. ( I'm assuming you're still in high school and he's above college age.) I get that ya'll have similar personalities and stuff, but the difference in life stages really can make a difference and eventually be a point of contention. People this young with older people have had success in their relationship before, I'm aware of that, but it is rare for it to be healthy as time goes on. I truly wish you the best. 

I'm not trying to be a buzzkill I promise! I just want you to stay safe. <3"
offmychest,fc6j9hm,t3_efvdyw,1577481900.0,"The same thing happened to me a few weeks ago. I visited my friend's house and amongst a big collage of photos with them and their friends and family, there were several pictures of us. I just reconnected with this friend and oh my goodness, it made me feel so seen. I may or may not have teared up when I saw it. Lol."
offmychest,fc6j2z6,t3_egbrzm,1577481777.0,"I know I don't know you, but I'm so glad you're here. <3"
offmychest,fc6ix7x,t3_egfefr,1577481668.0,Oh my goodness. That's amazing. Wishing you and him a beautiful future together. <3
MakeNewFriendsHere,f96b9ai,t3_e3qbv0,1575142467.0,"You sound like your life is very put together and I can't relate although I do also read very slowly. 

You're too cool to talk to me. Lollll. I wish you the best, fellow 16 year old.
