socialanxiety,feuuuio,t1_fetfj6n,1579390181.0,"I'm so glad she handled your situation with kindness and an open mind. One of the first things you'll learn in therapy is that it's totally okay to bail out. Sometimes it's just not the right time yet. It's okay to let your feelings get the best of you. You haven't learned yet how to tackle them and you were just doing the best you could with the tools that you had at the time. Trust me, therapists see a LOT worst on a daily basis. You'll be okay. You'll know when it's the right time to start your sessions. I wish you the best."
socialanxiety,feutxzi,t1_feps0sb,1579389870.0,Except exposure therapy only works if the patient is consenting and aware of what's happening. Put a little frightened animal through ''exposure therapy'' and see what happens. It hides under the couch and will never come out. Same happens with kids who don't yet have the emotional maturity to understand what adults are trying to do to them.
socialanxiety,feutfhl,t1_feq573f,1579389701.0,If you want to do exposure therapy you need the patient's consent and willingness to engage in that dynamic. Forcing a kid to do shit they're extremely uncomfortable with will only traumatise them further. Pretty sad that teachers still have no idea about this.
socialanxiety,feusp56,t3_eqjw9x,1579389561.0,Definitely yes.
socialanxiety,feusjut,t1_ferl98x,1579389521.0,"It's definitely NOT petty of you. A lot of those monsters are actually very well respected by the community and their families. Little do they know. My own teacher had a flawless reputation, my own mum loved her! You did the right thing by being honest to her sister in law. You can't change the past, but you can always be true to your own feeling, and that's the most validating thing you can do for yourself. I'm so sorry you had to deal with something like that. Wish you the best on your own journey."
socialanxiety,feurudy,t1_feruodv,1579389341.0,"Nope, she was actually very much venerated by all parents. My own mum adored her ''method''. Thank you so much for your kind words, they mean the world to me. She caused a lot of damage, but she I'm hella stronger than that. On my way to recovery and beyond. Wish you the best too <3"
socialanxiety,feurd75,t1_fetsx8b,1579389233.0,"Thanks for the kind words! She caused a shitton of awful pain, but she didn't kill me. I'm here to stay <3"
socialanxiety,feriny8,t3_eqdmxq,1579354367.0,"Hey, it's okay. Don't be too hard on yourself. A lot of people miss therapy appointments because therapy can be hella scary. You're doing the best you can. If it's any help, I was MORTIFIED with embarrassment the first time I went to see a a therapist. It eventually got a lot better as I got to know her better. She once told me she expects social anxiety patients to be embarrassed and awkward AF, nothing new to her. Great shrink, never felt judged, not once. Handled my problems with kindness and an open mind. Hope you find someone like that buddy, trust me, it does get so much better."
socialanxiety,feri5kv,t1_feqx6vg,1579354184.0,Thanks for the kind words. I hope so too.
socialanxiety,feri2mo,t1_ferfu3d,1579354157.0,"Preach, man. Probably left a trail of other kids with bad PSTD in her wake."
socialanxiety,fer3alb,t1_fer2dyp,1579349261.0,"Thanks man, hope so too. Not even one to hate people, but that bitch caused more harm than words can tell."
socialanxiety,feqk0aa,t3_eq9aem,1579342741.0,"I had a teacher in elementary who:
> once forced me to read in front of the whole class, my back to the blackboard. At the end of the first sentence she would shout ''LOUDER'' and made me go back to the start. She did this 20+ times. I was there on the verge of tears reading the same sentence out loud all over again for over half an hour while the other kids laughed and mocked me, to her great amusement
> made me give a speech on the microphone in front of the entire school at every school party, then came after me and apologised to the audience for my quiet voice, stressing in front of the entire school + parents that she was doing this to ''force me out my shell''
> once made me publish a book from writings she found on my secret diary, then sign autographs for 1000+ kids
> regularly shamed me in front of the entire class for my shyness which would ''get (me) nowhere in life''
> called my parents every other month to complain about it and recommend shock exposure therapy

I'm 28 and I pay half my salary in therapy these days. To that teacher, hope you're fucking dead by now."
