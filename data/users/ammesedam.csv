MadeMeSmile,ffgs783,t1_fffsz1l,1579913709.0,I was always super frustrated that my dad would always absolutely destroy us in board games. We played a lot of risk and monopoly from the time I was pretty young. The 1st time I beat him at risk I was probably 14  and it was one of the most satisfying moments in my young life. Getting to throw back his normal taunts as my army slowly dominated the board and having him try and fail to beat me back was incredible and gave me a huge sense of achievement. I definitely think it's important to give your kids realistic expectations and letting them earn their victories is really good for them.
Unexpected,ff7lqgb,t1_ff7c9ie,1579652560.0,"Among the many many problems with modern day execution practices is that due to the hippocratic oath doctors will not aid in an execution and therefore there was basically no medical professional involvement in coming up with the combo of drugs that are administered or the administration itself. In addition to that very few to no drug companies will make or sell the drugs used for lethal injections meaning that the places that do supply them are very sketchy. Disregarding opinions on if execution should still be a form of punishment, the way we do it now is horrific and in my opinion falls under cruel and unusual punishment.

AskCulinary,fevctqb,t1_fett32a,1579395830.0,"Yep, you explained it a lot more briefly than I did in another comment but breads that use a preferment and ferment longer are easier on your digestive system. You can think of it like the yeast and bacteria predigesting the flour for you. Our bodies are not great at breaking down wheat by themselves so the longer a bread is able to ferment the more it is broken down into simpler and easier to digest components."
AskCulinary,fevbzru,t1_feu4tgl,1579395599.0,You might be suprised to know that baguettes traditionally use a levain preferment that usually is made with a sourdough starter. The portion of the starter in the levain and overall dough is small so it doesn't add much of a sour flavor and a levain can be made just with manucafted yeast but it will yield a less flavorful product. The trendiness of sourdough is just leading many bakeries to use a higher percentage if sourdough in their breads to grab the current market.
AskCulinary,fevbd0h,t1_fetj7sb,1579395347.0,"This is a long answer but I love baking bread and the science and methods behind it. 

Traditional yeasted breads almost always use some kind of preferment. Sour dough is often used as at least the base for these preferments or as the preferment itself because it is flavorful and a traditional method of keeping yeast alive to add to breads. In the US a lot of places moved away from using preferments for a long time because it was fast and easy to just use manufactured yeast. Yeast bought from a manufacturer added straight into a dough yields less flavor and complexity as well as usually reducing the time a dough has to ferment (resting to rise, develop flavor and gluten). 

Dough with a longer resting period and also with the bacteria and enzymes that live in sour dough starters are actually healthier for you as well. The longer a dough is allowed to rest and ferment the more the flour is hydrated, then broken down and process by the yeast and bacteria/enzymes making it easier for us to digest. There were actually laws passed in france regulating the minimum amount of time bread dough must be fermented because people started getting digestive issues from cheap bread fermented quickly. 

Different preferments include bigga, poolish, levein, pate fermente, and others. Good pizza dough often uses a pate fermente which is essentially old dough. They would save a portion of pizza dough from the day before and use that in the new dough to increase flavor and improve texture. Here is an article explaining some kinds of preferments: https://food52.com/blog/17140-preferments-and-how-to-adapt-any-bread-recipe-to-use-one#types

Another process used to help with the fermentation process for good bread is autolysing. This is when you pre mix at least a portion of the flour and water to allow the flour to hydrate more fully and be more available for the yeast and whatnot to break it down leading to better texture and flavor. 

Tldr: most traditional breads use some type of preferment. Sourdough has recently come back into fashion after years of manufactured yeast being the norm so a lot of bakers that are trying to get back to traditional bread baking with better flavor and texture are relying on sourdough as their main preferment method and base."

childfree,feb3ond,t1_fe9dh94,1578955147.0,"Not really personal items but as a cashier at a liquor store it was super important to read the customer and know when comments were appropriate. I knew a lot of my regulars and was open to giving advice or chatting about the party they were planning, I would comment if I liked whatever they were buying or suggest something else but if someone looked like they were having a rough day and bought a lot it was just polite small talk no comment. The biggest unspoken rule was if someone comes in looking more cleaned up than normal, especially in a suit or something DO NOT COMMENT (unless they bring it up) 99% of the time they're coming from or going to a funeral.

 I was checking out a group of women in their late 20s, all in black, all wearing a small ribbon pin. They were smiling and chatting with each other but still you knew what was up. We had one cashier who had been working there like 25 years, nice guy but totally clueless. He comes up as I'm checking them out and starts loudly joking asking ""wooeee! Wheres the party tonight girls?"" ""What's that ribbon for??"" The answer was of course it was for a type of cancer, and they had just come from the funeral of a former classmate. He then started talking about all the people with cancer he knows. I checked them out as quickly as possible (also gave them a 10% discount my boss allowed me to use at my discretion) and demanded he come help me move something in the back essentially dragging him away from these poor women."

Some types of pit bulls do indeed have an instinct for dog om dog aggression (there are also types of pitbulls that were bred for companionship after large animal baiting was outlawed) but they were specifically bred to NOT be aggressive towards their human handlers as they needed to be able to control the dogs between dog fights. The fact that pit bulls are commonly thought of as vicious and scary attack dogs means that there are many many bad owners who get them and encourage their aggressiveness or simply do not train them which leads to many of these attacks. A pitbull that is properly socialized and trained as a pet should never suddenly ""snap"" and go to their base instincts and maul a human or other animal. These statistics are skewed just because of the sheer number of people who either want a scary guard dog or get them to look tough and therefore mistreat and/or poorly train their animals.

Having the kitchen saved tons of money as well, we would usually eat breakfast and dinner in the unit and often pack lunches for during the day. And as you mentioned having a washer and dryer is a major plus especially if we booked 2 weeks in the same unit. Even with fees and upfront cost they said the weeks worked out to well under $1000 for each trip and we used them every year for skiing, visiting family, disney (not on property but at a very nice marriott timeshare) and various other trips. 

When my Dad was between jobs after retiring from the military we were still able to take our annual ski trip because the timeshares were paid off and it was just $250 for the exchange plus gas and cheapo season passes at a small mountain.
