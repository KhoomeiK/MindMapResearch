Autoimmune,fegvt2a,t3_ep2tgn,1579103657.0,"I’d suggest you get your bloods done and tell them your concerns. I had raynards for a fair few years before other autoimmune issues cropped up. Mine isn’t thyroid related and I think that it could be a number of different things but you’re best to have a proper discussion with your doctor, get bloods and maybe scope out if there’s any sort of family history of autoimmune diseases. 

Best of luck!"
