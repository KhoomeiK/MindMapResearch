AMA,ffe2oju,t1_ffe2hrq,1579835128.0,"Thanks. You get used to live with it. At the beginning it was constant, but after I went to this program that did super hard (break down crying) exposures, it comes more in bursts. You can never get rid of OCD, only learn how to combat it"
AMA,ffe2eyc,t1_ffe2c8d,1579834930.0,"Good question. Like of you can't stop doing it. More specifically, if you try not to do it, you get large amounts of anxiety."
AMA,ffe2a5d,t1_ffe2252,1579834831.0,"Interestingly, all people have OCD. Being Diagnsoed with OCD is just people who have it to the extreme. Most people have things like that. I'm one of the people who have it to the point of disability."
AMA,ffe1acf,t1_ffe0wdu,1579834110.0,"Hmm... So, your brain tells you that you'll get sick if you touch a doornob. You know that this isn't true, but your OCD brain makes you avoid it anyways. Exposure therapy is specifically touching every doornob you see, so that you can prove to your OCD that nothing will happen, therefore eliminating the OCD anxiety. It's usually much more complex, but this is the simple version"
AMA,ffe0sqq,t1_ffe0he4,1579833753.0,"Sometimes. I don't have that kind of OCD, but in OCD treatment, the eat method is ""exposure therapy."" Basically, it's where do the exact opposite of what your OCD makes you do. It helps show your brain that there's nothing wrong with what you're obsessing about. Of course, logically, we all know that nothing will happen, but our OCD forces us to think otherwise. The exposure therapy helps combat that"
AMA,ffdx1pi,t1_ffdwr10,1579831050.0,"OCD can be anything, really. What makes it OCD is the obsessiveness, and the anxiety, and like you said, rituals. That's where the compulsive part comes in. You get a compulsive need to do something, like touching a doorknob, washinf hands, ext to satisfy yourself from whatever you were obsessing about."
AMA,ffdvqqn,t1_ffdvlmx,1579830123.0,"Mainly that it isn't just contamination issues and perfectionism, and that it isn't a ""quirky"" personality trait, and that it's much worse than most think. Nothing pesters me more than when people say ""lol I'm so ocd."""

OCD,ffd1me2,t3_esxqco,1579811633.0,"I have breathing-related OCD aswell. Mine is alot different so I don't know if my strategies can help. Mine was that I can't look in the direction of something and breath, and if I do I have to exhale everything I can from my lungs and choke myself.  This includes thoughts I have. For me, all I could do was distract myself. I know you said that it doesn't work well, but I can't think of anything else. Sorry."

Things like POCD can be really hard to talk about too, so you're really brave so mentioning it. Sorry I can't help, but I hope my sympathy can provide some comfort."
