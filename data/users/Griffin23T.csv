AskReddit,fewkfie,t3_eqies2,1579412602.0,"Thought about this a few times over the years, I still have no explanation.

So, for quick context, when I was 15 I lived in Fiji due to my Dad's job at the time and went to an international school. I was to be there for the final years of highschool and then we all go back home, business as usual.

One night about a year after I arrived, I had a very detailed and clear dream about starting a new school, back home, that had a blue uniform with a blue and white striped shirt and dark pants/skirt, in a wooden prefab building with a bunch of other people that I didn't know. 

Weird. I knew that I wasn't going to any new schools until graduation as the next three years had been planned out by my Dad's company.

Less than two months later we were being sent back home as it was too expensive to put me and my siblings through an international school according to my Dad's employers.

I started my new school a couple of weeks later.

A school with white prefab buildings and a blue uniform with a blue and white striped shirt."
Pets,fewil2x,t1_fewhytj,1579411272.0,"It sure is. My cat is fortunate enough that I am able to let her go outside and be safe, but I did have to keep her in once when she had an illness (skin infection) and gave her a litter box. After only one day the thing stunk BAD and I had to clean it out thoroughly and even used toilet cleaner it was so gross. I can't imagine what a month would smell like..."
Pets,fewhmeu,t3_eqs2s2,1579410728.0,"Ultimatum. This is animal abuse. Tell him that he MUST clean the litter box or you are obligated to report him. Doesn't matter if you're bluffing, gets him to step up and save the cat."

It's unbelievable that a person would send kids outside during an ACTIVE shooting because she's a bit cranky. I'm so glad none of you were hurt - or worse.

I would have had her marched out of the building, double time, with a police escort if I was there.

Doing the math since you said it was post Sandy Hook (December 15, 2012) and you were about eight or nine at the time, you're really young, yet you write like an adult. Proud teacher over here :)"

I really feel for you."

AskReddit,fc6rz4j,t3_egar5e,1577487972.0,"I would get the mathemagicians to decipher the number after the fact, but I would ask for this: ""what is the number to acquire balance between humans and all other species living here on this planet?"" I may not like the answer, but it would certainly be telling.

I rescued an injured pigeon yesterday. Right wing injury with bleeding up by it's shoulder, no obvious broken bones. Clipped by a car and consequently chased by my neighbors cat. We made cars, we bred cats.

What do we need to do to bring balance back to the inhabitants of this planet? Nobody knows."
