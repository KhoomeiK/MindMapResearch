Fitness,ff5ps6d,t3_erqdg6,1579605162.0,"Honest answer: don't think behavior based. Think in terms of your identity. Building a habit, such like eating healthier and becoming fitter, isn't about ""wanting to do things so you become fit.""

Think inside out: Be fit. Be a person that is fit. Be a fit person. Make this your new identity. Don't put a label on yourself that you don't want to see yourself in. Determine who you are. You're a healthy, fit person.

Then, just do what you identify yourself as. Does a fit and healthy person eat fast food twice a week? No he doesn't. That's not even who you are, so you don't do it. When others ask you, ""why not join along for eating out?"" 

As a fit person, you can tag along; but you choose to eat the healthy option. Determine who you are and your behavioral habits will follow on their own. Take responsibility for yourself and your actions, only then do you have control over yourself. Don't ever let go of your power; the power that you have over yourself - it's the only super power that is truly yours and no one else's."

It allows you to take mental breaks since it's almost impossible for your attention span to be longer than 30 minutes at a time, and it's not too short as to being unfocused.

Fitness,fdq6ywl,t1_fdq6n4e,1578657533.0,"Thing is you don't any muscles. Yes, abs are revealed in the kitchen, but they are *made* in the gym. Your issue isn't that you have stomach fat, it's that you lack abs. Just keep lean bulking, hit your abs every other day additionally to your current program. That way, the muscles that you build will ""fill out"" your body if that makes sense. 

You're really low in bodyfat, the very thin layer of fat that you have right now will nuzzle against your muscles once you build them up.

Advice: bulk, be in caloric surplus. Hit your protein intake, and just lift"

Stoicism,fcu1eq1,t1_fcu065b,1577969302.0,"I do not believe there is a lack of choice for healthy foods in America at all. You'd be healthy eating veggies, rice and meat for the rest of your life. Don't pretend like all America has is processed food in supermarkets.

If you're poor, r/EatCheapAndHealthy has proven u can live on 5$ a week and still do fine, and it doesn't require you to spend much money on processed food.

Fats aren't bad for you, sugar is. I do agree with you that the US has huge sugar problems and there's way too much of it everywhere, also restaurant portions are immense. But in my opinion, most of the factors aren't outside of your control, you just need to inform yourself. 

Up to the point of gathering the knowledge, I guess it's out of your control in the sense that you don't know anything about it so you just live by what you get. But that's a lifestyle/mindset decision - choosing not to inform yourself is itself a choice."
Stoicism,fctzakc,t1_fctyr76,1577966855.0,"First of all, this has nothing to do with morals or being a lesser person just because you're overweight. Secondly yes, it doesn't that take much time to inform yourself over which foods are good and which aren't for your body/weight.
