AskSF,fgoiuvd,t1_fgo9sbg,1580971586.0,Plus they give out really high quality umbrellas and sometimes fresh cookies!
Awwducational,fg2lzo1,t1_ffzrayi,1580447742.0,Thanks for pointing that out.  My main thesis still stands (despite the downvotes): I don’t believe there is any evidence for the claims about the pouch.

I’ve seen these “explanations” for the cat pooch before, but I’ve never seen anyone provide any evidence for them and I don’t believe they’re true.  Don’t lions and cheetahs need to protect their bellies and be able to jump good?  Where’s their pooches?"

news,fefyhse,t1_fefyeld,1579069512.0,"You can’t discriminate against people 40 or over in the US, at least for employment. You are free to discriminate all you want against anyone under 40.

I once bought a house, built in the 1920s that had a CC&R (covenants, conditions, and restrictions) that the house could not be sold to people of Asian descent.  That part of the CC&R was unenforceable due to its being unconstitutional."

news,fefxv2e,t1_fefxnr7,1579068845.0,"I’m afraid that’s not how this works.  It is very standard for HOAs to issue fines, for liens to be placed on houses for unpaid fines, and then for those houses to be foreclosed on.  The law is the law.  You don’t get sympathy points."
news,fefxjdq,t1_fefw8hl,1579068511.0,"Because you signed an agreement when you bought your house that is part of an HOA to abide by the HOA rules. That agreement is a legally binding contract.  If you violate the rules, HOAs can levy fines and keep levying them until you “correct” the violation. If you don’t pay the fines, they can have a judgement filed against you and take your house. 

As long as the HOA rules don’t violate laws or the Constitution — just speaking for USA here — then it is a legally-binding contract between informed adults that all parties have agreed to."
IAmA,fefwjd9,t1_fef0teq,1579067520.0,"I posted about Berberine a long time ago, with references, if you care to dig for it. Berberine causes DNA damage. I don’t think anyone interested in longevity should be going anywhere near it. 

For example:

Berberine induces oxidative DNA damage and impairs homologous recombination repair in ovarian cancer cells to confer increased sensitivity to PARP inhibition

But I do remember that I wasn’t able to use the vise itself as a template, so I tried tracing it out on paper."
woodworking,fdmhnkw,t1_fdmhdfu,1578550238.0,I did use a Forstner bit. I think one problem I had was identifying the *exact* location for the centers of the holes.
