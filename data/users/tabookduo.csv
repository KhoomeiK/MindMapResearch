dragonutopia,ff949ac,t1_ff93k9r,1579704475.0,"The blurry part? I was wondering if that was rope that maybe got shot off, but I don’t know enough about these to speculate"
learnart,ff69n12,t1_ff2a3ad,1579622365.0,"I absolutely LOVE colored pencil, that’s awesome. :-D I tend to take a long time to work on stuff though, it’s super fun to layer the colors and see what you get. Have fun and I hope you share again in the future!!"
learnart,ff29npc,t1_ff28ojm,1579497932.0,"Hey your art is definitely considered art, regardless if you like it or not! Plus, this is a whole new area, so you’re just going to have to do a lot of practicing. :-) There are gonna be a lot of pieces you spend a bunch of time on and think they look terrible, especially since you’re trying to make a picture that is supposed to look like something specific (I was so afraid of portraits because of that for a long long time). Honestly I’m no pro so my stuff is hit or miss, maybe it’s all practice forever LOL. 

I don’t have procreate so I can’t help with that part, I’m sorry. Mess around with the brushes and blending without trying to make a picture to see if that helps. :-)

 Blending on paper is super fun in my opinion, but it’s sometimes a lot of patience just laying down layers. Do you want to work in color or graphite or both? You should try your hand at something and let us see, it might make it easier to help out!"

Edit to say: I think if we got to the point where we compulsively lit on fire to counter being colder, it would have already been something we needed to evolve and so it’d be natural and survivable, if that makes sense. I should come back to this after a bowl"
learnart,ff288co,t3_er7tjp,1579496662.0,"I feel like once you get the hang of it, you’ll be amazing at realism. :-) I love the shapes here. Do you have any reference photos for realistic stuff that you want to work on? Are you working digitally?

I tried to type out some nonexpert advice (I like to do realistic drawing) but none of it came out right! Is there anything specific you’re having trouble with? Do you think you’ll have time to try out a realistic piece to dip your toes in the water? :-)"

I have a stupid story in the meantime, my ex told on himself for using grindr while we were dating lmao he found *his* ex on there and thought it was funny enough to tell our friends and myself at a starbucks, dude didn’t even realize until nobody laughed and someone asked wtf he was doing"

nosurf,fewbmdj,t3_eqr0o9,1579408014.0,"That’s kind of why some people decide to delete them, the weird social obligation to click a button that really means nothing, so much better to give and get compliments in person :-) I’m sure if you tell them you’re not going to have it anymore, they’ll understand. That way you wouldn’t feel like you’re leaving them hangin"
