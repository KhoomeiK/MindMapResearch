Anger,femqeg0,t1_femq4dk,1579266550.0,Thank you for the advice. Maybe I will try and reach out to a therapist or counsellor
depression,fe7k27a,t3_envmp8,1578915674.0,This is exactly how I feel as well. I literally cannot express my emotions without music. Music is the only thing that lets me cry or feel real sadness. Any other time I’m mostly emotionless. Sometimes I listen to music to force myself to cry and release some emotions. Music is truly magical.
depression,fddjnb7,t1_fddjfft,1578314900.0,Yeah that makes sense. I try to find all the things I’m grateful for in the day to keep me focused but sometimes it’s hard. Thanks for the advice!
depression,fddj99z,t1_fddj1vu,1578314482.0,Thanks I’ll check them out! And I hope you’re okay
depression,fddj7lj,t1_fddizhw,1578314431.0,Yeah I’ve been to anger management before. I never really act out on my anger but I just feel hateful towards everything if that makes sense. I’m never violent or anything like that but I can just feel it in the pit of my stomach and it’s horrible. It just consumes me.
depression,fd96wxy,t1_fd966yk,1578229253.0,Aha I would say 9 of those hours are on reddit honestly. But I like [this](https://waitbutwhy.com) website a lot too!
apolloapp,f13aatm,t3_d7kwjv,1569157266.0,Nice!
