Except we get 1% when we get one.  Some years we don't get one.   Also employee reviews have no impact on whether we get raises or not, so my boss just copy pastes his every year (he's also not in charge of whether or not we get raises, that's a company decision)."
AmItheAsshole,ff3spka,t3_ergc1h,1579548023.0,"NTA.  I've always been pretty up front about the fact that my mom having a baby when I was 9 and keeping him in my room because there wasn't any space played a big part in souring me on children.  I got to see what having to care for them is actually like and I knew I would not want to deal with that.  It's always been me just stating facts, not laying blame.  My parents didn't get upset about it that I'm aware of."
fatlogic,ff34rhb,t3_eqyzqn,1579533652.0,I spent 36 years being accepted just fine.  I had friends.  No one in my life that I actually cared about hated me cause I was fat.  I didn't just magically wake up being scared of being rejected one day.
fatlogic,ff34cht,t3_erdeb4,1579533352.0,"Ok but when I had knee pain I lost weight and...surprise!  It went away.

I still have crepitus (I messed my knees up both by being obese AND by sitting at a computer in weird ways, oddly enough) but they don't hurt anymore unless I overdo it on the jogging.  So if I give you advice on that subject (I probably won't unless you ask) maybe it's based on personal experience and wanting to help you improve your pain level instead of me hating you just because you're fat."
AmItheAsshole,ff07s4n,t3_eqwol3,1579466127.0,"NTA. You're discriminating against him because of his behavior (rightfully so) not his diet.

I do low carb.  It's not that hard to work around it in ways that you can participate but that don't put other people out.  All else fails, I bring my own food or eat at home.  He's being a dick."
fatlogic,fenyvjv,t3_epp4wg,1579292823.0,Thanks for helping to water down the impact and meaning of the word violence with your nonsense.
fatlogic,fehqgnb,t3_ep4l2t,1579121833.0,"As a binger in general and someone who ate what she wanted over the holidays (it's a tradition and conscious choice), trust me.  No.  No they really don't."
fatlogic,fee6ajm,t3_eomp8j,1579027283.0,Ok but that 10lbs was probably just water
fatlogic,feay4qe,t3_enqqdd,1578953425.0,"""Please handfeed me articles that validate my feelings only.  Thanks!"""
fatlogic,fdvvxr4,t3_en29tf,1578752209.0,"I weigh less than I did in high school and have no interest in bearing kids, but thanks."
fatlogic,fdvvfam,t3_en0ezr,1578751946.0,This is the stupidest shit I've seen in 2020 so far.
fatlogic,fdp6mpv,t3_embfp2,1578621226.0,"I'm real tired of the reactionary ""just say you hate [insert minority]"" bullshit.  Just say you want to put words in my mouth that aren't there for whatever stupid ass reason.

And let me assure you I, uh, don't get winded going up two flights of stairs.  Damn, get up and go for a walk now and then."
AmItheAsshole,fdp6ab2,t3_emch4u,1578620997.0,Nta and also I think that hobby is awesome
fatlogic,fdn7p3a,t1_fdlbxbl,1578579538.0,"Thank you! 

I gained a bit over the holidays because that's when I choose to go off Diet (it gives me a chance to eat what I usually don't, and also serves as a reminder as to why I eat the way I do the rest of the year because by the end of The Great Indulgence I feel so bloated, tired and crappy and get such terrible skin I actually look forward to going back to my usual way of eating).  It'll come off soon enough though.  I'm feeling better already."
fatlogic,fdksbfq,t3_eluhvm,1578510124.0,"Idk man.  When I was fatter I definitely ate more than I do now.  Which is why now I'm often still like ""uhhhgg I want to eat more"" even though I've eaten more than enough to maintain myself.  Habits, you know.  


The secret is:  When you feel the urge to put more food than you need to (to maintain a healthy weight) into your facehole, you stop and then you... don't do that."
fatlogic,fdgxj7o,t3_el8kky,1578410771.0,...She seems upset.

I will say, though, I have a cat that had a retained canine baby tooth that stayed in too long.  The adult canine grew in a little bit crooked.  He's fine, but he drools  -\_-   Generally when he's happy.  All over me."
