An ED will or should treat this pain as a life or limb situation and have you seen quickly with an US to rule out torsion. My husband has had ball issues and was appropriately seen in the ED in this manner. Luckily no torsion just other problems. In younger boys they might say they have a stomach ache and later reveal the testicular pain. People say grow some balls to tell you to be tough but those danglers are pretty vulnerable.

Infection control practices in dental offices can be troubling.

MagicEye,fbjdyb4,t3_edkc89,1576931427.0,Yes I could never see anything until it was suggested on one of these posts to touch my nose to the screen and then slowly pull away. I always thought I was an idiot for not being able to see. Brains are weird.
