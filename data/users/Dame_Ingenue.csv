aww,ff43b4y,t3_erea67,1579554616.0,This dog is teaching me how to live.
PsoriaticArthritis,ff433gt,t1_ff40vfp,1579554486.0,"Oh no! Sorry to hear that! I live in Nova Scotia, Canada, so I think the syringe and needle is a little old-school. Sorry I can’t be of more help. I wish you luck!"
PsoriaticArthritis,ff40omg,t3_erhjvn,1579552989.0,"I was taught to give myself injections in my thigh. Can you ask your doctor if they would recommend the thigh as a location for your injection? I preferred it because your veins are pretty visible so you can do a better job avoiding them. Also, my other suggestion it so inject the medication more slowly. Doing it too quickly can cause bruising as well."
cats,fek7a3h,t3_epgpwg,1579194085.0,Where is this committee? I want to be greeted like this every day.
PsoriaticArthritis,fdgycdg,t1_fdgxmf6,1578411322.0,Thanks! I tried ice at home last night and need to try it out again while I’m at work. Glad to know it works for you!
PsoriaticArthritis,fdgy8ak,t1_fdgx03t,1578411248.0,"Thank you! I do have compression gloves, but I only wear them at night and I’m currently at work (office job). I’ll have to consider wearing them tomorrow to work but I just hate the looks and the comments. 

I agree about food , and I’ve been wondering if this is from all of the holiday goodies that are still around the house. Plus for me alcohol really affects my PsA, and I did have a few beverages over the last few weeks. 

I am kind of pushing through by being at work, but I am trying to take it easy while being here. Thank you for your reply. It’s so nice knowing we are not alone in this. Especially during these particularly trying times."

cats,fcydi6o,t3_ej7dnb,1578078430.0,"Is this look of pure evil a permanent thing? And if so, how do you sleep at night? (Still, I think evil kitties are kind of the best)."
cats,fcyaon5,t3_ejgjhw,1578077247.0,"First, I must conquer Dad. Next, THE WORLD!"
CampingGear,fcy2gct,t3_ejdt08,1578073912.0,"I am loving this post, if only to learn what clothing items and brands are tried, tested and true. Thanks, everyone! I noticed the difference in jackets just this winter when I got a Columbia winter jacket and went for a windy hike on December 28th (in Nova Scotia, Canada). I've heard of ""wind resistant"" or ""wind proof"" but never truly experienced it until I had this jacket on. I felt nothing. It was amazing."
