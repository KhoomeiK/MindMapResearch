unitedkingdom,ffaoncl,t1_ff9scpo,1579740876.0,"Your view stated here is quite common today but it was not the view of the people over the past century who brought social housing into existence. It was mostly done as an infrastructural investment and the idea was that people given access to good housing would be more likely to succeed and prosper,  and would raise the standard of their communities. 

There have been housing policies like you suggest, for example in Pruitt Igoe in St Louis in the 60s.  There were homes there for single mothers, and they would raise the rent dramatically if they later married or cohabited, with eviction for arrears.  It had a bad effect on family life along with other similar ideas. The whole massive estate was a social disaster  and demolished after 20 years.

These days the high prices of housing and shortness of availability of social housing have lead many to feel it should be reserved for the poor as you say. That is a recipe for ghettos."

There is no one factor that makes a room a bedroom or not though. If you sleep in the bath, even for years it doesn't make that a bedroom.

While I see the attraction of kicking people out of housing if they are under-using it, its not a good strategy in the fight against homelessness and bad housing, to make people who are securely housed into people who are insecurely housed.

The whole problem is massively over-stated anyway. The majority of tenants who are under-occupying are pensioners, and they are exempt from the 'bedroom tax'."

That isn't a problem in itself. However its a terrible way to do it, just to restrict benefit to the person in their home. It exacerbates their poverty and increases arrears for the council or Housing Association.  A better plan would be to offer them a positive incentive to move. Some councils have had some success with this. Give them £1000 and pay for the removals truck. It's cost effective."
unitedkingdom,ff9n9zp,t1_ff8z2uj,1579716562.0,"This is about the physical suitability of the room though, not the chosen use of the room.

Give the arms inspector Hans Blix's [*Disarming Iraq*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Disarming-Iraq-Search-Weapons-Destruction/dp/0747573549/ref=sr_1_1) a read if you are interested. The Iraqis certainly kept he and his team busy, but in the end, they did prevent Iraq from developing and maintaining weapons of mass destruction, including gas weapons which require far less extensive facilities than nuclear weapons.

todayilearned,ff2knc7,t1_ff2ea91,1579510535.0,"Arms reduction is done using inspection of one sort or another. I seem to recall in one agreement the USSR cut missiles in half lengthways and laid them out to be photographed by American satellites, or aerial photography. Iran filled its nuclear reactors with concrete in its deal with Obama. The UN arms inspections of Iraq basically worked, though the Iraq war happened anyway.  

It would be very difficult to verify that a country has destroyed all its warheads. Its much easier to verify destruction of infrastructure and delivery systems. With those gone though, the danger of that nation is reduced. I guess North Korea could sneak a nuke into New York and threaten the USA from there, but I believe nuclear warheads require regular maintenance.

Also though, the main value of a nuclear capability is that the holder can threaten to seriously harm an attacking country, or intimidate more peaceful countries with the threat of conventional war which could be escalated to nuclear. if the nuclear capability is a secret, this strategic use for them is negated."
