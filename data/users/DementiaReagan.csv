> A VAT tax has proven successful in various other countries whereas a wealth tax have been repealed because they DO NOT WORK. Rich people are very skilled at moving and hiding their money and also avoiding paying taxes. A VAT is one of the only proven methods of getting these companies to pay.

Lol the rich aren't magically untaxable. And the [Sanders plan accounts for this exact problem](https://berniesanders.com/issues/tax-extreme-wealth/) Why should i pay more because the rich have evaded taxes? 

> You assuming that there aren't other policies under Yang's platforms. He has over 150, one of which addresses unchecked cost of medical care. When it comes to housing, supply and demand is still in effect. The government isn't printing new money, inflation isn't going to surge- you're also not taking into consideration that every single person in a community will now have 12k to spend in their communities. That money doesn't disappear, it goes back into the economy. It also gives citizens more power to buy vs rent. In my area, rent is outrageous it's cheaper to buy but most people can't buy because they don't have disposable income. As far as passing on costs- let's say UBI is passed tomorrow and Burger king is like ""Hey I'm going to charge $10 for this whopper."" But Mcdonalds keeps their prices the same- it's still a free market, you can move right on over to Mcdonalds and buy their mcdouble instead.

That's the thing though, it doesnt go back to the economy. It trickles upwards to the wealthy who more or less horde it. Some of it will no doubt go back. But the majority of consumer goods, and housing are provided by large corporate interests. This money is going to go to them and they don't spend it in those communities. You're also assuming a diversity of choice. But a lot of areas have effective monopolies.  

If you're in semi-rural american and your internet provider decides he's goint to charge 200 more a month you don't have a choice.  If,as you say, Yang has no proposal on rent control then people are going to end up just handing this money to landlords.  You can say that they're going to buy but uh, where are they living while they save for that? 

As for healthcare, yang's proposals are narrowcast solutions that focus on technocratic answers. They're just not compelling and don't do anything to address the insurance industry that is at the root of the problem. 



> It's pure speculation to assume that the bar will be raised- and furthermore, protected when it is raised. Again, the same argument can be applied to minimum wage. Now your landlord knows you're making $15/hr, let's raise the cost of rent- except that min wage isn't mobile, you can't just move to a different apartment, home, city, etc because you're tethered to your job.

It's not speculation, it's [a stated part of Bernie's platform.](https://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-public-assistance/) I agree that landlords will take every opportunity to siphon money from tenants which is why i support a candidate who [endorses national rent control](https://berniesanders.com/issues/housing-all/)

I'm not disputing that a UBI can work. But it needs to be part of a wider political agenda that provides a meaningful social safety net and protects it's recipients from being preyed upon.  Yang's proposal does not do that and would simply result in a continued transfer of wealth to the wealthy."

I don't dispute that the current social safety net is garbage. I don't dispute your critique of incrementalism.  However when you look at programs like social security the problem is once the left puts them in place they become so wildly popular that they become untouchable politically.  

It's a simple matter to undue incremental changes, which is why we need radical ones. Ones that work on the proven successful tract of establishing a broad and multifaceted social safety net, with a focus on labor rights.  A UBI, even if politically safe, can get sucked up by huge number of sources right away. 

You're saying you'd have to spend 120k over a year, and that's true if you just count the VAT. However, if you factor in things like housing costs, businesses passing along the VAT to consumers, the uchecked cost of medical care, it's clear that this money is just going to vanish immediately.

2. He does want to cut welfare directly.  ""consolidating some welfare programs"" is political speak for welfare cuts.  I have no doubt less people will use welfare, but if there are cuts then the ones that do will still have less to go around. Especially once the people who take the money realize that they're getting conned.  

3.  None of what yang says indicates and increase in a corporate Tax rate. None of it.  You're saying the VAT does that, when it mostly doesnt. Even if it did it would still be wildly more regressive and less efficent than simply increasing the tax burden on the rich.

Thank god those are never bullshit. 

And i mean if we can't trust the word of escaped prisoners who can we trust. I mean i'm sure people who escape Americans prisons would have super positive things to say about America.  And of course the omnipotent ""basic knowledge"", no way are you simply the product of the propaganda you consume. No siree."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fenut64,t1_fenu518,1579291158.0,"> He definitely emphasised the need for societal reform to guarantee a middle-class income for all Americans but the basic 'guaranteed income' idea is very similar to Yang's UBI.

No it isn't. Yang is explictly not for redistribution of wealth. That is a massive fundamental difference between the two.  Yang explictly proposes funding the UBI by [Cutting welfare programs and applying a VAT .](https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-freedom-dividend-faq/) A VAT would, by design, have a much higher impact on the poor as would the welfare cuts. 

That is not reform. That's gutting the already beleaguered welfare state and taxing the poor. There is no element of redistribution, there is no jobs garuntee, these are fundamentally different proposals. 

However they match Murray's ideas almost exactly. Because they're the same idea. Because conservatives want to kill spending on the poor. 

You're being tricked if you think these are the same."

MLK was advocating for wider societal reforms to guarantee Americans an income via redistribution and work programs ala green new deal. 

Huge difference."

It's monarchist peasant mindset, and we would be better as a country if we ignored it. 

Adding to that, Reagan was just as evil and demented as Trump but much more popular. Therefore, the evil he did in office is, on almost any scale, objectively way way worse than anything trump has done.
