todayilearned,fcj6egp,t1_fcj5pmb,1577678403.0,"It's my understanding that Gunner, Balto's sled master actually wasn't supposed to have delivered to the doctor either. Another team was but Gunner claims they were asleep so he made the journey himself. Some would argue he intentionally did this to get the fame. Also, Balto wasn't the lead dog, Fox was but Balto was a more newsworthy name.

No one is arguing that Balto and Fox and every sled dog involved didn't do an incredible job. It is because of all of them that things happened the way they did.

But there is still only one team who made a 260 mile journey, even crossing the open ice of the Norton Sound. Much less at 12 years old! That is unbelievable courage and strength."
todayilearned,fcj54iv,t1_fcj4vj8,1577677504.0,"They are. But only one team went 260 miles, and that deserves recognition."
