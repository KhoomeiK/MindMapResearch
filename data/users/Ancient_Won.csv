I had to add, so I won't link where i bought my jerseys but if you want me to pm you I will.    
Second, I bought my jerseys some time ago, the quality might have changed since then but the ones I bought, Brady, Gronk (x2), Revis were all purchased a while back. I had gotten a superbowl jersey and i forget the other type/style for the others at the moment but I compared them to what you could buy at Gillette and it was the exact same quality and looked exactly the same.     
Again, this was a while ago so the quality might have changed since then. I've not taken any special care of them either and they get washed with the regular laundry but they've held up pretty dang well.        
If I end up deciding to get another Jersey or two I'll def go with the same place again.

I do think its silly to put up a banner for going 16-0 but as I said they are only the second team in the 100 years of the NFL to do it so there is that. But the Colts put up a banner and I sure the ravens will to that they made it to the playoffs which is just ridiculous."

The military brass would much rather have a volunteer force and if you think for some crazy reason its based on wealth, your mistaken. Its far easier to get volunteers to do what you want them to do than conscripts. Any actual student of military history can point this out to you. Even Sun Tzu stated this.

Every General or person that has a say in that decision has stated they want things to remain as they are with an all volunteer force. Hell do you know how many people are turned down each month for each branch of the service? Lots. Even the Army and Marines turn people away. Not in the same numbers as the Navy or the Air Force mind you but its nothing at all like it was back during the Vietnam Era and it will never be that way again until the Aliens get here."
