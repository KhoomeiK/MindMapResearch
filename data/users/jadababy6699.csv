dogs,fgkz0kj,t1_fgkyxk8,1580877131.0,Definitely call for peace of mind but try to feel a little better that if he’s pooping there likely isn’t a blockage at least :)
dogs,fgkygyg,t3_ez2w72,1580876714.0,My dog just had a blockage 2 weeks ago that required surgery. He was vomiting blood and not pooping. Sounds like you’re safe to me

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fffrlmf,t1_fffql37,1579890280.0,I had it with 3 of my pregnancies and I was in my early 20’s and not high risk. Some dr’s will do it if you simply ask and are willing to pay or if your insurance covers it.
JaneTheVirginCW,fff2973,t1_ffeh14y,1579873733.0,Well he did jump in front of roses gun in the second to last episode.. so he was willing to die for Jane. Not sure what else you want
JaneTheVirginCW,ffdrls7,t3_et0gi6,1579827212.0,"Although I was team raf from episode 1, I’m going to try to be non biased in my response which I don’t think will be too hard because I also love Michael, and I also just love the show and all characters and sides in general. So with Raf, I feel if you pick a side and stick to it (like you deciding he is selfish) it’s easy to see him that way. But in the first season without knowing much about Jane at all, he risks his entire hotel when she sues Louisa for impregnating her because he wants her to do what she feels is right. He also doesn’t pressure her to keep the baby when he thinks she may have an abortion, even though that is his last known chance at a baby at all at the time, and doesn’t play the “cancer card”. When Jane goes to marry Michael even though he still loves her, he pictures himself telling her how he feels but instead decides to let her go. He encourages her to be brave, and gives her her voice on every occasion that she needs it. Not only that but we see him go to Michaels mom and give her the Snow Falling book and that’s why it gets published. At Michaels funeral he literally reads Janes eulogy for Michael  about how she could never love someone as much as she loved Michael, knowing that means she didn’t love Raf as much. To me that is the farthest thing from selfish there could be. The Abby and Petra stuff I’m not really sure what you mean.. He wasn’t in love with her the way he felt like he could be with Jane and that didn’t have anything to do with Petra. He and Petra got together afterwards."
