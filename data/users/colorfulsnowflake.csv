fatlogic,ff2zms8,t3_erdeb4,1579529656.0,"I have chronic back pain.   I fell down a ladder and later I turned the wrong way when catching my four year old son that was jumping up for me to catch him.  I can't undo the damage to my bones and discs, but I found losing the excess weight has done wonders to reduce the level of pain.  I also find taking walks and stretching to help with the reduction of pain."
fatlogic,ff210hc,t1_ff1u35t,1579490915.0,"Even when I plan to eat a lot at a buffet, I eat nowhere close to this many calories.  I'm usually satisfied with one small hamburger."
fatlogic,ff15l1a,t1_ff12a4b,1579475465.0,Agreed.  I get a lot of dirty looks when I look for clothes and nothing is small enough.
fatlogic,fezg42o,t1_fezcdqr,1579456966.0,"I'm one that needs to get a walk to get out emotional energy.  Eating more than usual can be fun if I'm eating out with family.  It's a fun thing, not a thing to destress."
fatlogic,fezfp6w,t1_feyzyf6,1579456853.0,"You can indulge in more if it isn't a daily or weekly event.  I often think about eating more than two scoops, but that is more than enough.  If I'm craving ice cream, I might eat more than one scoop, but two is always more than enough."
fatlogic,fen5mk9,t1_fen4kkg,1579277498.0,"I'm short, but I need to eat more since I walk a lot.  Find more opportunities to walk.  You'll be able to eat a little more and not gain weight."
fatlogic,fekp39d,t1_fekghqk,1579204670.0,"A few months, it wasn't overnight."
fatlogic,fejwt7p,t3_epk1xh,1579187655.0,"As I eat less sweet things, I find that I want them less.  When I do crave a cookie and eat it, I find I don't enjoy it.  I find them too sweet.  I buy sweets and they sit for weeks until they're eaten or given away.  I have a bag of chocolates in my room and I have no interest in eating them.

There was a time when I could easily eat two packages of fun size bars in one day.  Now, the same two bags last over a month."
fatlogic,fejpxbs,t1_feivlco,1579182828.0,"I'm small.  I'm short and normal BMI so small compare the US average.  I can't wear everything.  I disagree as a big busted woman short woman about tunic, overalls and rompers: I love them.  Still, people do say to me that I can wear anything and look good.  

First off, most stores don't sell size 0.  I'm over 50: I don't want to dress like a child so junior sizes are out.   Finding clothes that fit me can take hours.  Everything doesn't look good on me."
fatpeoplestories,fegrlvj,t3_ep2tn0,1579100910.0,"I ate them so I could get additional protein with my candy bar.  I'm trying to gain a little weight so I thought protein bars might help.  I now see them as a waste of money and just eat the cheaper candy bars if I need a pickup.  Then, eating a candy bar once or twice a week isn't going to do that much harm to an otherwise healthy diet."
fatlogic,fegmghn,t1_fegk45n,1579097217.0,My local discount grocery often has bags for a dollar.
fatlogic,fegj4nl,t1_feg155q,1579094358.0,"I was never that big, but I don't want to be fat again.  I don't want the chub rub.  I don't want the discomfort of having excess abdominal fat.  It's nice not to have a muffin top.  It's nice having clothes that fit without having to adjust them all the time."
fatlogic,fegixhh,t1_feerpw6,1579094186.0,Congrats with the weight loss!  I'm happy for you.  You must feel great.
fatlogic,fegipiy,t3_eotwps,1579093997.0,"I find that there are unintentional and intentional elements to any weight change.  I can only intentionally lose or gain weight if I'm in the mindset to do it.  Unintentional weight loss or gain can be a seasonal thing.  I tend to eat more when I'm cold.  I eat less when it's getting warmer (spring and early summer).  If I want to gain or loss, I try not to fight the seasons.  I take advantage of other situational things."
fatlogic,fegiai9,t1_feghwa8,1579093636.0,I often get frozen or canned fruit at the discount grocery store.  They do have fresh fruit for a discount as well.  You just have to get what is available that day.
fatlogic,fegi71c,t1_feghdpu,1579093552.0,It's even less if you hit an Aldi's or your local discount grocery store.  I find one pound bags of vegetables for a dollar each.  A bag is enough for two or three servings.
fatlogic,fedrzmi,t1_fecauy2,1579018630.0,My parents live in a senior community and there are a lot of thinner people with type 2 diabetes.  Most of them developed in their late sixties or seventies.  It's not unheard of for obese people getting it in their thirties or forties.   That is thirty years earlier.
fatlogic,febmbxy,t3_eocqju,1578960343.0,It's hard to have the discipline not to eat more.  That doesn't make it impossible.
fatlogic,fdwdwxh,t1_fdtb5iw,1578757701.0,"Funny, I wore a ten in high school.  I wear a zero now.  I'm 55; my children are in their twenties."
fatlogic,fdokrk2,t1_fdn8o22,1578607130.0,I rather not buy clothes.  I just bought more size 0 jeans.  I don't want to have to buy mew jeans anytime soon.
fatlogic,fdojupd,t1_fdoh0q6,1578606606.0,"Older people that are thin often develop type 2.  I know many people over 70 that are thin with type 2.  I get test twice a year because diabetes runs in my family.

fatlogic,fdmxz4m,t1_fdmuf0l,1578570786.0,Depends on the individual
fatlogic,fdkwxcp,t1_fdkqta8,1578512852.0,"I just posted my picture on facebook.  My mother told me that I look too thin.  My boyfriend want to fatten me up, too.  I'm 5'2"" and 110 pounds.  I'm a perfectly healthy weight."
fatlogic,fdhk4zj,t3_eleiia,1578424354.0,"I drink protein drinks to help me gain weight.  I still have to eat more since I lost weight from a cold.  If you drink two protein shakes a day, it should help you gain weight.  Protein drinks are for building muscle, not weight loss."
fatlogic,fdf6qxf,t3_ekd3yk,1578354590.0,"  If weight loss talk triggers her so much, she needs therapy.  It's not the other person's problem if your weight depresses you that much.  It screams, ""Me, me, me.""  No one can improve their life because it makes you feel bad about your life.  You need to make your life better.  If being fat makes you depressed, see a dietitian and figure out how to improve your diet.  I feel so much pain in this post."
fatlogic,fdf5nn3,t1_fdel96h,1578353871.0,"I didn't have disordered eating at a heavier weight or a lighter weight.  At a heavier weight, I ate more sweets and large portions.  Now, I eat small portions and less sweets.  It's that simple."
fatlogic,fdf5avg,t3_ekfumk,1578353641.0,"I'm not on diet.  I'm fine at my weight.  I might want to gain a little weight because I lost some when sick during Christmas week.  If I don't gain weight, I'm still good.  110 pounds at 5'2"" is not too thin no matter how many people tell me that it is."
fatlogic,fcoz0nx,t1_fco966u,1577845528.0,"Weight Watchers has a high success rate for people in the lower weight loss range.  People wanting to lose less than 25 pounds tend to be successful.  I wish I knew where that research was, but I read it years ago.  I'm a successful 15 pound loser."
fatlogic,fcoqjct,t1_fcnv0aq,1577838886.0,My boyfriend and a few of my family members think I would look better with a few more pounds.  Being at the lower part of the healthy BMI range makes you a target for criticism.
fatlogic,fcop6d5,t1_fcondc0,1577837889.0,I'm having trouble with cold liquids with my seasonal sore throat so I'm drinking herbal teas.  I figure they're mostly water and it's easier than trying to drink warm tap water.  There is also flavored seltzer for people that don't like the flavor of plain water.  Herbal teas are soothing to my sore throat.
fatpeoplestories,fcfnaxu,t1_fcaqz7j,1577631946.0,"You're not wrong, but you're being an ass.  I often have lost weight on bed rest since I don't feel like eating sick in bed.  Have some compassion."
fatpeoplestories,fcfmx1k,t1_fcaqme6,1577631833.0,"It's hard when you're in a situation beyond your control.  I understand why she ate the food.  Trapped in a room with nothing to do, I would be anxious.  Some people eat when anxious.  It's understandable.  Her situation was difficult and she's no longer in that situation.  There is no need to insult her."
fatlogic,fc9wi4v,t1_fc7m6mb,1577559227.0,"Me, too.  I'm thinner than I expected.  I think that if I was a little heavier that I might not get as sick as often."
fatlogic,fc1k1f2,t1_fc14geb,1577321081.0,"I see a therapist for anxiety and depression.  I'm weighed every visit. My therapist care more about the trend than my weight itself.  Weight loss, weight gain or being weight stable is part of therapy.  The mind is connect to the body.  It's that simple."
fatlogic,fbumeky,t1_fbuc4t9,1577116844.0,"The large amount of handicapped spaces could be because the baby boomers are becoming seniors.  Where my parents live there are many elderly.  It's not odd to see a large part of the parking lot for handicapped.  My father, who is 84, often finds all the handicapped spaces filled by other elderly people.

However, the scooters are for the obese.  The elderly avoid them if at all possible.  When a little old lady needs one, an obese person that should be able to walk has taken one."
