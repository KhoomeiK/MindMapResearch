SandersForPresident,ff9o7l4,t1_ff8s7jm,1579717117.0,CNN is still showing Biden above Bernie on their infographics with the correct percentages. The lengths they go to undercut Bernie truly are astounding.

trashy,fdlr4yj,t1_fdklkpu,1578530514.0,"It's not just lazy. My house looks a little like this but with laundry baskets and storage bins filled with all sorts of things stacked on top. My wife suffers from depression and hoards things because of it, coupled with being overwhelmed by the mess, it's really hard to dig yourself out. Figuratively and literally. Only plus side is our house is ours and she's working really hard to get better."

gatekeeping,fcpatir,t1_fcp8w1u,1577856502.0,I love shifting. If our car wasn't a tiptronic transmission I'd hate driving it.
gatekeeping,fcpagsf,t1_fcp8yai,1577856144.0,"Technically once you get moving you don't ever need to clutch. If you start your shift a soon as you take your foot off the gas it'll pop right out of gear, let the rpms drop like 500 and you can slip it right into the next gear. Same for down shifting but instead of letting the rpms drop you rev it up a bit."
gatekeeping,fcp9z83,t1_fcp7ruz,1577855644.0,"My 94 Isuzu Rodeo had little light that said ""U/S"" with arrow pointing up whenever the rpms got too high. It's like the same, right?"

ChoosingBeggars,fco6ptm,t1_fcn1to4,1577825125.0,"His whole plan was to act like he never left in the first place. Apparently that's a no-no when you want to get the house in a divorce. Gf's mom ended up getting an order of protection to get him to leave (he's an avid hunter, gun enthusiast, racist, and all around shitty person). 
And a happy healthy baby girl was born a few months later."
ChoosingBeggars,fcn0xny,t1_fcmlxze,1577800062.0,"Get a load of this one; my girlfriend and I were about to have our first baby, so we decide to go back to her home town where her aunt is an ER nurse to have the baby in that hospital. We are staying with her mom, who had been separated from her dad for a few years and was just starting divorce procedures. One night the front door opens and in walks dad (who hadn't lived in the house since the separation) with a garbage bag full of clothes and a small hardware store bag and he just books it upstairs without saying a word. A few seconds later we hear a cordless drill and some rustling, so we go to see what's up. Motherfucker changed the door knob on gf's little brothers (who is away at college) bedroom door and locked himself inside. We called the cops and they came over, took statements, and left. Said that since his name is on the mortgage there's nothing they could do."
