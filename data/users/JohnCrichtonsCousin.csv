Classic Sony not giving support or asking for money to fix their blunder.

mildlyinteresting,ffa9li2,t3_esi78y,1579730560.0,"I like how detailed you went to basically say having a rotating restaurant is more efficient than having a bunch of different restaurants. I'm sorry to say there are a lot of problems with this idea.

A cook needs to settle into a space, into a cooking program, and be allowed to express their personal experience as a cook, i.e., make their own decisions. Something like this would require massive standardization and would allow for almost no wiggle room from cooks. That's not only improbable, no cook would want to do it. There is a long term settling in process with cooks that is necessary to make a food business efficient and profitable. The idea of rotating cooks and cuisine type every week throws all of that off. 

For example, one cook prefers to use butter over margarine. Or one wants to use sunflower over peanut oil for the fryer. Or one refuses to use a dishwasher machine and the location only has a tiny sink and a huge industrial dishwasher. You would need a HUGE collection of spices in house to cover all the different kinds of food there are. 

The ingredients you buy to make food for one week's menu won't be needed in the next week's menu, so the excess is wasted money. For example, buying up a bunch of lamb for Indian week, then next week it's useless to the American BBQ rotation. That means you either lose money by taking the hit on the excess ingredients, or you buy the ingredients conservatively and end up running out of food and having to turn people away, lose profits, before the end of your week.

You would need a pretty wide variety of equipment as well. Indian needs a tandoori, asian needs a wok, etc. You can't just move ovens and stuff in and out of a kitchen every week. 

And this isn't really touching on how fickle good cooks are. The food industry is hard and if you've done it long enough to be good at it you're a cranky SOB about certain things. Having a new one every week would drive the owner crazy, if all the food planning doesn't first."

riskofrain,ff5kmaf,t3_errs1z,1579597408.0,"This is a follow up to my last post, attempting to get Commando's skin and dying at Stage 6 to a basic jellyfish in the back. Sweet run, great items, worst luck. 

I went to the Bazaar before Stage 7. It's Shattering Justice and War Horns. I freak but I fear losing my green healing items. To protect my Leeching Seeds and Harvester's Scythe, I bought three, count 'em, three...War Horns. Through that I lost a hoof, 30% crit, two Mags, Slug+Tooth and a Topaz. For Justice I not only lost the Scythe, Pred Instincts, and a Hopoo, but not a single War Horn was taken. I wondered then if that had done my run in, but I bought the Gesture with my remaining coins and left.

The Stage 7 Boss was 3 Malachite Imps. I shot two lightning strikes and two Phase Blasts at one, which took a little more than half its health, before swinging out away from the group, still rotating about it. I take a couple wisp shots from the hoard and turn to shoot them when a Bighorn Brahmin gallops in from out of frame, and punts my spine into the frozen ground. The exact same maneuver the game pulled last time I posted, with a jellyfish. It wasn't even the Boss. Just some well placed, well timed, basic enemy. The tele didn't make it past 15%.

TL;DR
I lost heals and mobility in bad trades before stage 7, but gained shattering justice and a gesture for my fuel cell'd capacitor. 3  Malachite Imps spawn as Boss, I'm doing great damage. Then I die at 15% tele-charge to an off screen ninja bison after getting wisped just below OSP."

Grovetender and Overlord are two bosses you do not want to be close to ever. 

The problem is the enemies stack up and standing close to the boss means the hoard is all around you instead of being a group you circle around. At close ranges, you need a lot more movement speed to dodge ranged attacks from lemurians and wisps, and any imps will trash on you. Even if you just dip in close real quick to get a shot in, you're risking death big time.

You can kill the first stage boss within 5 or 6 shotgun blasts (not excluding other damage output) with a 6 second cooldown meaning it's 25 or 30 seconds to kill, sometimes it's less. But that also means you're spending 30 seconds at spitting distance from the boss which typically means death. You can still land partial hits with the shotgun at slightly longer ranges but it's just a waste of damage.

I miss the range and penetration ability of the phase round often as the pellets don't penetrate.

Coke merely urges on already present neurotransmitters such as dopamine. Gambling does the same thing. Physiological chemical dependence is more your body trying to adapt to the drug and survive. Cessation of any addiction will lead to a deficit of dopamine and make you feel down because your brain believes it is a behavior crucial to survival because of our reward system psychology. Basically the brain mistakes whatever your addiction is for wholesome survival behaviors like eating or having sex due to the similarly large amounts of reward juices it releases. Your brain doesnt really see the difference between a coke addiction and a gambling addiction. They're high reward therefore they're crucial for survival and you should do it as often as possible. Cease doing it and it'll make you feel bad, like being separated from a loved one. It's good programming displaced in a wildly different environment where there are a million and 1 sources of reward juices that aren't at all related to survival or sex, most of which will kill you eventually.
