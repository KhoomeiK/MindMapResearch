As for getting into the field, just make sure you have a solid stats background for starters. Know ML SOTA practices and packages. Python is superior to R. End of discussion.

It could be that their immune systems didn’t respond as well as they should have to the vaccine.

And fully vaccinated people are also less likely to spread the disease to other people, including people who can’t get vaccinated because they are too young or have weakened immune systems.

mathematics,fdiu49q,t3_elhklz,1578451079.0,"I did a math undergrad and I currently work as a software engineer / data scientist.

Here are my suggestions:

* Category Theory: Very useful for making metal models of things like databases and composed functions and understanding their consequences from a category theoretic perspective. I use it as more of a philosophical/big-picture guide day-to-day.

* Linear Algebra: If you work with any data at all. This is a must. Thinking through transforms on data, normalization/scaling, etc... It's all linear algebra (and usually college level at most). Not to mention all the ML stuff if you're doing that.

* Stats: Pretty obvious when you work with data.

* Combinatorics: It's very common to have to think of ""how many ways are there to do this?"" (perms/combs and whatnot). And knowing when to count something or when you can divide something out mathematically is super helpful. Also used a lot on mental models of algorithms as I write them.

* General Math Ability: This is kind of a non-answer but I'd say it's the most important day-to-day. Just having the general familiarity with how to convince yourself of something rigorously via proof will put you miles ahead of other developers. For instance, I might write a function and see that it sends two values in a list to the same output. From there, I can immediately realize: ""oh this function isn't injective, so I won't be able to revert this function when I apply it (in general)"". 

The most often I use my math is to convince myself in my head (via mini proofs) that what I'm writing does exactly what I want it to. I treat each problem as a challenge to write something and them prove to myself that it does exactly what I want. 

side note: A lot of people are saying graph theory... I've literally never had to use anything major in that field on the job. In a sense, I've used a lot of ideas that overlap with concepts in graph theory but I feel like it's being overstated. I mean yeah, you deal with trees and heaps and other graph-like structures but it's not like you're studying them mathematically. You're just using them."

NEU,fcl690a,t3_eesrh1,1577740704.0,"Was a MATH/CS major. 

Easiest class: Logic and Computation or Theory of Computation. If you take these classes after some proof-based math classes, then they'll be a breeze for you. The reason being that the class assumes you're CS and don't have a background in rigorous proof. But with a math background, you'll already have those skills (they'll literally spend a week EACH on teaching proof by induction) and be able to focus on the real meat of the subjects.

Hardest Class: Personally it was Rings & Fields or Cryptography. But those aren't required for your major so I'll give you my hardest *required* class: Group Theory. It starts off slow but things get very abstract very quickly. Normal groups, subgroups, automorphisms. It's a class that easy to fall behind in and very hard to catch up in alone. It's also probably going to be your first taste of abstract algebra which is a huge part of math in general. So being introduced to all these new concepts will make things difficult. Real analysis is a close second. It's just calculus but from a very rigorous perspective. You answer questions that took for granted in calculus before by proving things from the beginning (and by beginning, I literally mean the first proof you do is proving that 0 != 1). And then you dip a bit into Topology near the end. 

So yeah, Group Theory / Real Analysis are probably ones to watch out for. The hardest CS class was probably Algorithms -but I'd say it was easier than my average math class. Feel free to DM me questions on classes."

I have absolutely no background in representation theory but it seems like the point is to map group structure (or any algebraic structure) to a complex field (or any field) and that somehow makes a lot of analyses easier or more natural because now you're working in linear algebra? At least that's what I grasped through some initial research.
