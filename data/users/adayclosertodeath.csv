AskReddit,ff3h81a,t1_ff3bid9,1579540970.0,"Yeah honestly I think what hurts a lot is the fact that my they won’t acknowledge or talk about the past 

My mother basically acts like it never happened/ isn’t still happening

AskReddit,ff3gdyl,t1_ff36ep8,1579540492.0,"What I mean really is how much it affects you as an adult (or seemingly fucks up your life)

It’s something that keeps affecting your life even when you get older 

It doesn’t make you a bad person or fucked up in that way but it can seriously fuck up how you deal with things and relationships and your trust"
AskReddit,ff3fzv0,t1_ff37o26,1579540274.0,Thinking like that in general can help but when I think like that I just end up saying that my problems aren’t important enough or bad enough to deal with and it can make matters worse for me and then I never deal with the deep seeded issues

AskReddit,ff1yqmk,t3_er6y6j,1579489271.0,"OP here:

Like, I didn’t realize how many things I blocked out of my memory and how much it fucked me up as a person 

I always look back and think fondly until I remember some shit:

-my brother threatening us with a knife and threatening to kill himself and I was the only one who could calm him down (when I was like 9 or 10)

-my mom getting really drunk and basically babysitting her as a kid, she’d get mad at us or would make me stay up really late with her 

-my mother had times she threatened to kill herself and I had to get the knife away from her when she was drunk (I was like 10 or 11)

Man I really blocked out some things... I guess from the outside we looked fine so I never really thought about how it wasn’t normal"

Aphantasia,feik6yn,t1_fdom96p,1579140433.0,"Honestly for me it makes logical thinking easier 

I am able to learn skills faster with hands on stuff because visual doesn’t stick so hands on is great

Like it makes lots of aspects of art easier

It can make things like learning to sew and do car maintenance easier since you learn by hand and muscle memory

For me it makes my auditory imagination and memory a bit stronger so I can remember songs and come up with songs easier 

It also challenges you because you cannot rely on your imagination/ recalling things in your head 

So you’re probably in the end going to know things better and retain it longer because of that 

I mean there are obviously many downsides but everything has a downside"
