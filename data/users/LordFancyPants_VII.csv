I was just in game one day chatting with a Hoovy when I used the no voiceline and I creamed myself when I realized what I just heard. I’m not new to TF2 either I’ve been playing since 2013. My personal theory for how this happened is that I’m secretly stupid
exredpill,fdkmh72,t3_elo9mi,1578506615.0,"I can’t give the best relationship advice (I used to be red pilled after all) but I can give you some very general tips on how to deal with someone close to you being red pilled and how you might be able to save them from that cult.

Tip 1:

Talking about politics is a double edged sword. On one hand it might make him realize he’s not totally in the right about things but on the other hand it could lead to an argument. My suggestion would be to try talking about what kind of effect politics has on you personally.

Tip 2:

Be ready for him to openly talk to you about conspiracy theories. He won’t tell you about them because he’s dumb but rather because he wants to be smart. Poke small holes into everything he says enough to make you sound like a skeptic but not a SJW. Try to use a strategy I call “You could be right” which I name after something my Great Grandma would say to people she thought were dumb. Don’t outright say that he’s not correct but hint at it.

Tip 3:

Remember that it’s not up to you to change him but up to you to help him change himself. I don’t mean that you should baby him or, even worse, become a 1950s house wife. I mean that you shouldn’t think that proving all his “facts” wrong will make him change because this is far more physiologically based. He subconsciously knows that what he thinks is wrong kind of like how someone in an abusive relationship knows that the person they “love” is toxic but they stay with them regardless.

Tip 5:

Red pilled men are usually sexually frustrated but in different ways. He’s probably going to have sex on his mind when you two or alone on the trip. The other guy did a pretty good and far more in depth suggestion for that so I’m going to talk about the less specific things. He might have a kink that is generally seen as unmanly. I know a lot of former red pillers who just didn’t want to accept that they were furries, bronies, or even LGBTQ+.

Tip 6:

Literally everything I said could and definitely should be taken with a grain of salt. These tips I gave you can differ depending on what type of person he is. He could just be misinformed and change the instant he is brought in contact with new information or he could be a super extremist who will never change his ways no matter what. I still recommend you try some of them out but I can’t guarantee they will 100% work.

I hope I helped you at least a tiny bit so thank you for reading and listening"

exredpill,fcz1y3y,t3_ejdhs7,1578092033.0,"I left the red pill behind because I started growing so extreme that I would openly challenge people around me for having different opinions than me and luckily for me those people around me were my family. They were always respectful in these debates while I was acting like a rabid dog because that’s how people like Ben Shapiro always said you should approach a leftist. I stopped after the first couple of times because as cliche as it sounds, love is more powerful than hate and I felt terrible after every argument. In my last year of being red pilled I would constantly call up my sister and have talks with her about it. Slowly but surely I became happy again and realizing that I stopped myself from going down an even darker road than the one I was already traveling was one the most blissful feelings in the world. It’s like when you first put on glasses and the world just seems so much more vibrant. That’s why so many leaders in the red pill circles try to get you away from people who love and care for you because no matter how down you get there’s always someone willing to lend you a hand but that human bond is something that runs against their ideology even if they don’t do it intentionally. It’s okay to doubt your beliefs if you think they are hurting you or other people. I’m very proud of you for taking this huge step and I’m not afraid to admit that I was not as brave as you are right now, actively seeking help from people who can help you is hard for many people and the fact that you’re here right now is great to see"

You’re acting like an incel who is claiming to have an iq of 160. Can’t wait for you to only focus in on one specific thing I said and take it completely out of context to pretend like you’re smarter than me when I’m the one who actually realizes that men could always beat women because the lack of gender equality so maybe I should stop pretending like men are being oppressed which they are not. I can’t be a racist, sexist, homophobe I’m just being ironic after all.
