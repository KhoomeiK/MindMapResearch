CatastrophicFailure,ffdxcgr,t1_ffdv3bh,1579831263.0,"I'm Australian too. I would never say that *any* subject is off limit for humour, but I *do* think that making jokes about our fires while people's lives are being lost is in poor taste, and is also not particularly funny. 

But edgy people are going to be edgy, particularly from the anonymity of the internet. You are allowed to make jokes about whatever you want, but the truth is that it was just not particularly funny anyway. Just as the endlessly repeated ""Anne Frankly/ did Nazi that coming"" puns are. The truth is that jokes like that are not even designed to be ""funny""; more to get a rise out of people. They are trolling. 

As to these conspiracy theories, frankly, after spending most of the morning arguing fruitlessly with a committed anti-vaxxer, I tire of getting sucked into potentially poor faith arguments. But alright, let's just take *one* of your stories just as an example:

Did Larry Silverstein take out ""terrorism insurance"" on the WTC just before 911?

Answer: yes, but it's not that simple. He was not the only leaseholder (all the other non-Jewish ones, including a GM subsidiary and Westfield America, are never mentioned) and the lease was taken out 2 months before 911. Liability insurance would be *obligatory* for a leaseholder, and inclusions for terrorism would not be out of the norm. Indeed the *previous* leaseholder received a $50M payout after the WTC was bombed by terrorists in 1993. Silverstein and the others would be crazy *not* to make sure their property was covered for terrorist events after it had already been involved in a terrorist attack less than a decade previously.

So the facts behind the internet meme expose the story for what it really is: an attempt to smear Jews by implying that they not only were responsible for 911, but also conspired to profit from it.

Frankly, this is the state of the internet now. It is full of lies and half truths, and armchair investigators more interested in finding things to bolster their narrative than in sceptical critical appraisal. And for reasons that are beyond me, it seems like blaming ""the Jews"" is very much back in vogue."

The De Stefano study discussed thiomerosal because the anti vax lobby **keeps shifting the goalposts**. 

Nevertheless the majority of those vaccines contain aluminium, so my point about dose effect stands. The De Stefano study is not ""essentially meaningless"". You clearly misunderstand how a case-control study works. The ""controls"" in this study design are children without autism. 

Again I concede that more study should be done on aluminium safety, but I do not concede that your cherrypicked collection of studies are particularly compelling. 

The latter French MS study you write is a particularly poor example of epidemiology, relying on raw observational data (number of cases vs number of doses of vaccine sold the year before) without even identifying individual cases and matching them to vaccine exposure. I find it telling that you are willing to blithely dismiss a well constructed retrospective case-control serious and then in the next breath cite a rather weak piece of ""evidence"" to bolster your claim. I fear your cognitive bias means you are simply unwilling to accept evidence contrary to your pre formed views."
clevercomebacks,ffdcila,t1_ffcbv8p,1579817976.0,"1. It is still intellectually dishonest to use Zimmerman as some ""smoking gun"" gotcha moment when he himself (who was not interviewed for that article) admits that his view that *some* individuals (specifically in this case infants with mitochondrial disorders) rarely might regress after vaccination is based off personal experience rather than data. The large bodies of epidemiological data from which he based his expert testimony and from which the scientific consensus arises do not show a link:

https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(13)00144-3/pdf

https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2727209/mmr-vaccine-associated-risk-autism

2. Mice models are used because they conveniently do not live long, and they are useful in *some* models of disease. Their use to study autism is controversial because they simply lack the cognitive sophistication to actually have the disease. There are no gene knockout ""autistic"" mice. Indirect measures of neurological development are hypothesis forming but simply may not parallel human neurological development at all.

3. I actually concede that there are some technical issues with the way that ""safe"" levels of aluminium we calculated and I actually agree that more controlled studies of aluminium adjuvants would be useful to establish long term safety. I would point out that insoluble salts, while likely to be excreted more slowly and persist longer in the body, are also going to spread to distant tissues extremely slowly because they are not water soluble. They are far more likely to mostly remain in local tissue or be carried to lymph nodes. The claim that anything but infinitesimally small amounts of aluminium might make it across the blood brain barrier into brain tissue strikes me as implausible. Your mouse models used be very large doses of aluminium containing vaccine compared to humans and were injected directly into the peritoneum rather than subcutaneous tissue or muscle. None of your quoted studies demonstrate aluminium salt in brain tissue.

4. On day 1 the infant brain is ""most vulnerable""? Citation needed. 
You at any rate have missed the point as to why it is being given for an ""STD"". The most common route of transmission worldwide is vertical (is - mother to infant) transmission. 60-100% of infants to mothers with HBV will contract the virus in the first 6 months of life. Furthermore the *consequences* are far worse for infants with HBV, with almost a third of them progressing to irreversible cirrhosis.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062549/

I would point you towards the De Stefano article I linked above in point 2. If aluminium toxicity from vaccination was the culprit, we would be seeing more autism in the individuals that totally completed the schedule and received all doses-  and therefore more total aluminium - than in partially vaccinated individuals. The data however did not show any such correlation.

The issue with any attempts to engage with the anti vax community is that the goalposts are constantly shifting. First it was MMR causing autism, which was disproven. Then thiomerosal. Then the number of vaccines. Now it's aluminium. This smacks of ideology rather than true scientific curiosity."
clevercomebacks,ffd93q1,t1_ffci04u,1579815829.0,"Thiomerosal is a preservative. It was never banned and is still used in some vaccines.

You have not answered my Twitter link to Dr Zimmerman’s rebuttal, where he essentially completely denies how The Hill article characterises his statement in the civil case.

Mice, who do not get autism, are not necessarily a good model for human disease.

You are yet to demonstrate epidemiological data linking vaccination to autism spectrum in humans.

Aluminium neurotoxicity is not a new finding but “the dose makes the poison”. Infants are exposed to aluminium incidentally in the food that they eat from day one. The onus is on you to establish that the aluminium load of vaccination is a toxic one.

A lot of vaccines contain aluminium as an adjuvant. Why you are mostly harping on about the HBV vaccine is unexplained."

There are no good mouse models for autism, because mice don't get autism.

There is no compelling evidence that vaccination is the cause of autism.
