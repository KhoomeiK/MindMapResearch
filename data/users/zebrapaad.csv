curlyhair,ff9jm3j,t3_ese4nw,1579714400.0,"My mom was single and white with three half-black girls. She always loved our natural hair but didn't have any idea of how to take care of it.  She relaxed it so it would be easier to brush out the tangles. Ultimately, I think she gave up because of how much we fought her. But by then we were so used to straight hair that we'd still have her relax it every few months until we were adults. 

I didn't start transitioning to natural hair until I moved to Chicago when I was 22. I saw so many more black women there than were where I grew up.  But along with that I saw a lot of issues. I saw the damage incurred by constantly relaxing or getting tight weaves, or braids. I had never really seem wigs before that either. It seemed so strange to me. To hide part of who you are to make other people more comfortable. I also saw so many more women with their natural hair. They rocked it. They were so beautiful and confident looking. 

Part of my reason for transitioning was because I no longer had my mom to relax my hair and was terrified of salons. Another part was the encouragement and interest from my (white) SO at the time. He thought natural hair was so beautiful and interesting. I'm about 3 years in now and don't plan on ever going back. 

Hope this helps. Good luck with your thesis either way."

selfimprovement,ff2x7uf,t3_er7ebs,1579527488.0,"I really focus on the activity that I am doing right at that moment and doing it the best I can. Even things like washing my face - how can I wash my face *really* well? Maybe if I make the foam bubbles extra tiny. And make sure I get my nose creases really well. And around the edges of my lips. Oh and my eyebrows. I always get hidden zits in my eyebrows. ... And so on.

Then usually when I'm finished washing my face, I feel really proud of myself for doing it so well."
selfimprovement,ff2wkr3,t3_er9uy9,1579526861.0,"Is there a community college near you? Take one class that you think will be super interesting. 

That helped re-inspire my interest in learning. I had to borrow some money from my parents, but it was a really good investment. After I took that class, I took two classes the next term, and three classes the term after that. My interests changed, but that was okay. Afterwards (I had already graduated from college before taking the community college classes) I applied for a master's program. The summer during that, I did an internship, and now I have a great job and really enjoy what I do.

It sounds like you have a great support system that is willing to assist you with taking care of your kid! I sure they would also support you taking steps to grow as a person!

Edit: I'm sorry, I missed the part where your gran passed away. Sorry to hear that! My advice still stands though! The tough part would be saving up the money."

selfimprovement,feretgy,t3_eqg204,1579353056.0,"It sounds like you're trying to control other people's feelings instead of your own. It sounds like you think people should feel bad for living their lives. Well. They shouldn't.

Nothing is really fair, and learning to be okay with that is a big part of life. Maybe try to focus on positive things in your own life. It sounds like you have a great work ethic. Your job sounds interesting. What is it?

That or focus on getting what you want in your own life. The point is, stop worrying about what other people have or do and just become engrossed in getting what you want out of your own life.

curlyhair,fer6z8g,t1_fepoh8w,1579350553.0,"The CG method is meant to enhance the health of hair, which in turn enhances curls. But hair is all made from the same stuff, so the CG method should help enhance the health of straight hair as well! 

Something to keep in mind though, curly hair is usually more dry than straight hair, so a lot of the CG method is dedicated to getting lots of moisture. So there will probably be some experimentation before finding your perfect routine. 

Good luck"

curlyhair,feodk1d,t1_fenvbb2,1579298707.0,"Silicones won't damage your hair. As the other commenter says, it creates a barrier which prevents the loss and absorption of moisture. I don't know what can wash it out, but if you found something that says sulfate free shampoos can, then it's worth a try."
Anxietyhelp,fekpm6h,t3_epd52y,1579204983.0,"I had exactly this same problem. With every therapist I saw. When they asked me about how I felt, it was like I was physically unable to speak. I didn't know how to explain the emotions and feelings I was experiencing. Even if I was asked about something terrible that happened, I would respond ""it's fine"" even though it definitely was not."
longhair,feh12kk,t3_eoxawu,1579106918.0,"I agree that it depends on your lifestyle and your products.

 For lifestyle - if it's not really getting dirty, then there's really just the oil your scalp produces to clean up. Shampooing all your hair when you don't need to is likely to dry it out. 

For products - if you are using products with silicones, then you SHOULD wash all of your hair (preferably with a shampoo with sulfates). Silicones create a barrier that prevents moisture from getting into your hair. They are good for heat protection, but since you said that you don't use heat, it might be worth looking into products that don't contain silicones. That way, when you do wash your hair, you don't have to wash all of it. (Hence, you get double moisture benefits)

As far as conditioner goes, I recommend conditioning all of your hair, because it is meant to provide moisture. The ends of your hair are more in need of that moisture than the roots."

curlyhair,feggk2f,t1_fegg8or,1579092042.0," The folks on r/longhair recommend not trimming it until the ends start getting out of control, so if length is what your aiming for, that might be something to think about.

curlyhair,fe6726q,t1_fe65kqw,1578883244.0,"I agree with the other commenter suggesting a clarifying wash. I wonder if leftover product/gel is contributing to preventing it from curling back up. I use Suave clarifying shampoo when I wash (almost never). It's like, $1 or $2. I'm interested in hearing if it works! My hair looks very similar to your curly hair!

Edit: I just looked up gorilla snot and it says that it ""easily reactivates with water"" which means it's probably something that sticks around even after you shower. The clarifying wash will probably help get it out!"

curlyhair,fe5bajz,t3_entyvm,1578867291.0,"You're ridiculously gorgeous.

My hair does the same thing if I put it in a tight bun or tight braids for multiple days in a row. Do you style it in a bun 7 days a week? Or do you give it day off?

curlyhair,fe50621,t3_entgbx,1578864456.0,My biggest suggestion is to switch to no dry brushing. Only brush when you're conditioning in the shower. I think that'll help you achieve more of the definition you're looking for.
