Yes. Just fucking do it. Do some mild exercise so your body craves energy more, but other than that. Just do it.

Your stomach has probably shrunk in volume because it’s not used to a lot of food. Just eat an extra spoonful every day for a week, and the nausea should decrease at that level of food (your stomach adjusted, however if you keep eating one more bite than ‘full’ instead tracking volume, you’ll keep that feeling because *your still eating one more bite than your stomach likes).

That’s perfectly fine. I’m not telling you you should weigh more, but if you want to, eat more, be more active to trigger more cravings, and again, eat more. You can also just eat the same and cram a protein shake before bed, but if you’re feeling nauseas from an extra spoon I don’t know if that’ll go down well.

If you want to gain weight, it doesn’t matter if not every bite tastes delicious, just eat it.

I read the article, I haven’t read the verdict itself to see if Tbs was included. Dutch courts often go for a relatively low sentencing if they add tbs. Tbs offers control of the subject, as well as psychological care.
