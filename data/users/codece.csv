Really hoping prices normalize once supply ramps up to meet demand, but knowing Illinois I sort of doubt it. They are keeping pretty tight control of the number of growers and dispensaries here, and of course 100% of the legal dispensary product must be grown in IL by a licensed grower.

My prediction is that the legal dispensaries are going to a HUGE amount of business in IL in 2020, raise millions and millions of tax revenue, that revenue is going to be mishandled and misappropriated, the few corporations that will control most of the business will work to keep prices as high as the market will bear, and of course the IL politicians will keep tax rates as high as possible.

Meanwhile the underground business is going to multiply exponentially."

The people at the front had been there in the cold since midnight. Stood in line for 2 1/2 hours before I got inside, ended up paying $78 total for an 1/8th (3.5g) -- they were limiting sales to flowers, pre-rolls (~$20 for 0.75g joint), vapes, and only 3.5g of flowers per customer. I am happy for this historic moment, but I have never paid so much for weed in my life, and probably won't again. Of course I'm sure eventually as the supply scales up to meet demand prices will drop.

*Edit: Just took my first legal hit in IL, and thankfully it's pretty good. Everything is sold in pre-sealed, opaque jars so you cannot see it before you buy it. I got ""Bubba Fett"", which is listed as having 0.37% THC (???), but 31.4% THC-A, and 0% CBD. Packaged on 12/23 so it's pretty fresh. Indica dominant, it hits really nice and I can already tell it's a creeper. One minor annoyance is that, aside from not being able to see it before you buy it, when you buy it you choose from a menu that has ""0"" info about the strain or the THC levels, just a strain name. The people taking your order can guide you as to what is more sativa/indica but they did not seem to have detailed info on % of THC. Also what they had for sale was exactly none of what was on their menu online.


*Edit2: Ok, now 10+ minutes after 2 hits from a mini-beaker -- wow! I really am pretty impressed. Starting to feel a sort of heavy body-buzz of the sort I normally only get from edibles, and am well on the way to couch lock. Been smoking an average of a 1/2 oz (14g) of flowers per week of good quality herb, so I already had some level of tolerance built up, and this stuff is gonna knock me flat in about 2-3 more hits. The pricing is nuts, but I am going to have a good day!"
news,fcongrm,t1_fcomaos,1577836639.0,"> As of January 1, weed is legal in Illinois. 

Yep. Although the prices here in IL are borderline criminal. An 1/8th of flowers (3.5g,) with tax, is going to be about $75 (just checked a local menu for this.) A 0.75g pre-rolled joint, with tax, is going to be about $20.

I'm okay with legalization, but the framework in Illinois is not really terrific. Looking at the past states that have legalized it, those with lower taxation and lower barriers to entry into the industry seem to have the fewest problems. Illinois seems intent on being at the opposite end of that spectrum.

The legal dispensaries are going to do well here, no doubt. The underground market is going to do even better."
