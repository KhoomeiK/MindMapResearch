AmItheAsshole,ffcd84e,t3_esve6c,1579796937.0,NAH. I get she is upset but if she thinks you should pay a lot more for your wedding dress by waiting for her to be able to be there she is the asshole. Maybe have her be on facetime. What if something happened with her plane going back home? I still wouldn’t be 100% sure I would he able to be there if I was her but I like to think worst case scenario. You should definitely save that money by try to incorporate her that someone take pictures and send to her or she is on facetime

AmItheAsshole,fex9oss,t3_equc6v,1579427348.0,"It’s difficult but I would say NTA. You both share finances i’m guessing and should make this decision together. But you can still help your mom by kinda keeping the money. What if you help with 75% of the home then make sure you’re 75% the owner of the property. Or go to the bank and write an agreement that you LOAN her this money and will get it back when they sell the house or through small installments each year. 

Your family’s position really is bad and I think your husband needs to think what he would do if he was the breadwinner and it was his mother and brothers. But you shouldn’t do this without his consent even though he couldn’t survive without your income, it’s still a shared income. But if he sees you won’t lose the money maybe he won’t be that against it. You just wanting to do this is not an asshole move but going through with it without his consent is an asshole move"

tattoo,feh0v20,t3_eoky8p,1579106793.0,"I played the last of us a year after it came out and fell in love. It definitely is my favorite game. So since then I decided if I ever got a tattoo it would be the firefly symbol from that game that means “look for the light”. I have had some ups and downs in life so always being reminded of looking for the light at the end of the tunnel means a lot. So a bit before my 18th birthday I made an appointment and got a time a week after my birthday. I knew I wanted it on my wrist because I could look at it and because of the meaning the location was really important to me. 

I honestly never would have made an appointment myself because I was so scared of the potential pain. But my friend wanted one so I told him I always wanted one too, and he pushed me to be brave. Now I have had it for over a month and am in love I am so happy I went through with it and its meaning."

So it means we text like 1-3 hours a day or something, we are long distance so this is extremely important since we don’t see each other often.

AmItheAsshole,fcso1c4,t3_eipef1,1577920793.0,I think opening hours are a bit tricky since the customers thinks that if you are out or in by the time it is fine while the employees only get paid until closing and therefore wants everything done then. Honestly if your supervisor says you should do that you should do that. But still as customers you expect that you should be able to be in the store until that time. I think customers should be allowed in the store until the open time and then employees getting paid 30 min after opening time to get the last customers out and done while finishing up the closing.

Honestly don’t listen to others when they say what keyboard or other things to get. Multiple guys have tried to control what I should get because in their opinion razer sucks but I have had the same mouse for like 5 years now and I am very pleased.

tattoo,fc2kz83,t3_eficlj,1577365385.0,"So the healing process does include scabbing and I would just wait and see what you think about it when it is fully healed. Before it scabs the tattoo can actually float out a bit in the over layers idk what to call it but you won’t notice it until scabbing. You said the lines look thicker rn than when you got it so that is probably the reason why, when mine scabbed it looked the same size as when I got it again. 

Also why the M looks darker is probably because it is the first place that will scab, if you look at it from an angle and if you see it sticking out then that explains why it is darker, it will fall off and look less black when healed. I got mine on my wrist and it is also a bit crooked and changes when I move my hand to less crooked to super crooked. It’s just a place that really depends on how your hand or arm is while getting I guess, but maybe you aren’t used to it now and overthink it a bit, just wait and see how you feel about it when you’re actually used to having a tattoo, I can still wake up and look at my arm confused for a second or two before I remember I actually got the tattoo"
