HumansBeingBros,ff47b89,t1_ff3sx15,1579557112.0,"Spent 7-day vacation in Turkey, and most of the time was spent on petting cats and dogs. They were so very friendly! It was genuinely hard to say goodbye to the little cat hanging out by the Airbnb, she'd greet us every single time :("
MasterReturns,ff43wf5,t3_er2tty,1579554981.0,"I love that noise they make mid-meow, it's so cute. I manage to imitate it pretty well and my cat responds in turn!"
Ni_no_Kuni,fezneoj,t1_fezlvdm,1579459314.0,"I wouldn't say it's amazing but it's a really fun movie in tune with the games. I wish we had more time in the other world and got to see more of the different sets of characters, but it's a cute story with nice visuals. Worth streaming for sure."
witcher,fewm0o1,t1_fev7gjd,1579414170.0,"That's one of my favorite quests, and oddly sad."
BlackPeopleTwitter,feqp2z4,t1_feq3mnv,1579344464.0,"Everybody feels like shit after a long flight, in varying degrees. I'd rather stay seated until I can actually get off the plane than stand around like an awkward bozo."
BlackPeopleTwitter,feqoqvl,t1_fepuncg,1579344330.0,"If you wait long enough to board, you might not find any space for your carry-on. People are rude as hell and have no issue dumping their carry-on and shopping bags in the bin and be assholes about it when you try to find space."
AmItheAsshole,fep2rdt,t1_femfysh,1579310836.0,"When I read he was in another country and wasn't in contact with you, I thought he was actually on his way to be there for you :( I'm sorry you went through such an experience and I hope you have recovered from it and doing well."
MasterReturns,fen56pj,t1_fem2zvo,1579277215.0,"Have three cats and two of them had to spend quite a while at the vet in separate occasions. Once the cat was home, it was grooming and cuddle pile, no aggression at all."
BlackPeopleTwitter,femy0cy,t1_felu4ea,1579272526.0,While trying not to make any move that'd give away the bags of chips ready to crinkle at any moment
BlackPeopleTwitter,femxwjh,t1_fempels,1579272452.0,"I had an employee actually ask to check my bag once, which was indeed full of snacks. All it took was ""nah, thanks"" for him to let it ago. They really aren't paid enough to give a shit."
watchpeoplesurvive,fel0pep,t1_fekd3rv,1579211556.0,"I watched it first without sound and all I felt was amazement he seemed okay. Watched it again with sound once I noticed it's available, and I got goosebumps and felt like crying. They're so horrified, it hurts."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fej29dx,t1_feifedx,1579154230.0,"I see this sentiment all over Reddit; this generation is fucked, while our parents had an easy cruise. Just like in every time period, a lot of people struggled, mentally or financially. Just go read through experiences shared on Reddit itself, a lot of people grew up poor and with absent parents who had to work their ass off to provide for their kids."
