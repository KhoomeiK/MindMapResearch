AskReddit,ffa9s1l,t3_esc8vq,1579730664.0,I would hug myself and tell myself that the abuse will stop. That I will become strong and end up a network admin instead of on the streets or dead.

DeadBedrooms,fenq0ef,t1_fenhe9y,1579289190.0,"I am sorry about that. I did mean her. But you say she is a gentle person. She is just worried. While I don't agree with the verbal part of her coping, I can see she is just scared and overwhelmed. Most of her comments are about you going with a smaller/younger woman. I think that she needs some soul searching to come to terms with the person holding her back, herself. I had to do the same as well. I do hope it works out for you, whether you stay or leave. And I hope she finds herself as well."
DeadBedrooms,fencegb,t3_eq2mb6,1579281684.0,I have said it before in one of these post. VERBAL ABUSE IS ABUSE!!! You think of her feelings and she should think of yours. I know how this story progresses and usually it becomes physical.
DeadBedrooms,fdpqewj,t3_ekvsnk,1578636582.0,I have been checking your post to see if there is an update. I hope everything went well.
LowLibidoCommunity,fdpb9un,t1_fdpaavw,1578624331.0,"I suffer from sexual abuse which causes me to do the same thing. When I noticed it, I explained what I was seeing and then explained the feeling. They agreed that it was the same thing. They have always done this so I never pushed for anything more."

DeadBedrooms,fdelq7w,t1_fdekcsf,1578341692.0,Verbal abuse is abuse. It will escalate for you now that he feels like he is losing his power. Please get out. I hope the best for you because you deserve it. <3

DeadBedrooms,fcz96w6,t3_ejlmcj,1578096205.0,Speaking from someone who has a subscription...she has issues.
LowLibidoCommunity,fcx45vw,t1_fcwdu7p,1578050438.0,:) I did. We had conversations but tbh he is probably the best thing that has ever happened to me. I just told him that I accept who he is and we are working on our relationship more now.

pics,fc18pbj,t1_fbi1r6e,1577311453.0,Not sure why this got downvoted but I stand by what I said. It is good to see people doing everything they can for their little ones.
DeadBedrooms,fc15ce0,t3_efih4h,1577308704.0,:( I am so sorry you are hurt. Its obvious talking isn't anything he cares to do. I agree that you said no. You are too good for stupid pity sex. I hope it gets better. <3 <3 <3
AskReddit,fbwajkg,t3_eeluzh,1577144861.0,"I was exploring BDSM with my ex when I stumbled across a guy fully strapped down to a chair. The girl jerked/fucked him till right before he came and then...she stopped and he just came with nothing helping him. Good ol ruined orgasm. At first, I was like, ""what's the appeal?"" And then I couldn't stop thinking about it. And then it was basically all I would want to do. I wouldn't even be having sex with him. Just a simple toy and it would take no time to orgasm. Not sure if it is the whimpering they make or the power but I have never been the same since."
IAmA,fbv9fup,t3_eelbfy,1577127557.0,Did you ever go for the chandelier? It's priceless.
