For more context, I once went to a therapist and started speaking with full honesty and got out everything in my mind, he kept asking me about different symptoms (I knew most of them and he was trying to diagnose out of them but still didn't manipulate the answers), and at the end of it he just said: ""You don't have any disorders, you're just an Avoidant Personality, I will prescribe you meds for sleeping and appetite, and don't read in psychology as some text are poorly translated and bla bla"", true he may be right and I should give his opinion some thinking but after reading more and more, I'm certain with what my mind has."

if nothing works it's best to just remove the transition and try to overlap the clips again with the appropriate overlap length chosen from beginning so you don't have to resize the fade itself which can be troublesome.

Sidenote: I hate Openshot's autosave actually as it saves on the same file, sometimes I don't wanna save but it does anyway LOL, after you get used to the technique in a new test project you will feel more confident with editing your 1st project (even if it gets screwed up it will still be fixable).

Yes I used vulgar language, but not targeted insults, anyway let's consider I'm to be blamed for this and I agree with that, the same kind of language was used on me multiple times from many users which got me to the point of snapping out like so, never anyone on the mod team has said or done anything.

Let's analyze his proof image comment by comment:

The first one was targeted at the original offending user which claimed I follow her around reddit, I already mentioned the whole conversation before in this comment ([again](https://ibb.co/PTzCQwv)).

The 2nd one was targeted at a user who first asked me ""why do you think your comment will be downvoted?"" which I answered by just mentioning my very first comment which was downvoted too (practically saying it will be downvoted for containing similar POV), then he attacked me personally and accused me to be a man who would just say something that he knows is wrong and will get downvoted for it and just want victimize himself (accused of being sexist and misogynist in summary)

This full conversation is shown [here](https://ibb.co/Bf4ZY7c), my first and 2nd comment contained no violations, the third and the fourth contained insults and attacks from my side I agree, but for the love of God I just can't remember what triggered me in his deleted comment just above them,

and why were all the other party's comments deleted by a mod? this user is actually one who usually use vulgar language on the sub so it's not a big deal to him, he insults, I insult, everybody on the sub does, I'm not actually the type of profanity lover guy (you can take my word for it or not, your call).

The last image was with the same user responding to him after stating ""It's clearly obvious what religion are you"" and then proceeding to use it as a way of accusing me of all the stuff I've been accused with before, total disrespectful and racist speech targeted at my religion.

Me saying ""STFU"" is just like ""GTFO"" and ""Incel"" which our mod here can't understand why I took them as an insult, if you think it's not, than my words aren't too.

lastly:

>Modmail: [https://imgur.com/a/ai9aeTp](https://imgur.com/a/ai9aeTp)

Here is the whole [conversation](https://ibb.co/hKH2ptK). accused of being irritating, and racist, the last one actually was I copied this mod's text and switched the word ""incel"" with my words and resent it (visible in the image)

**A mod that is taking it personal:**

many time before you said nobody cares for my posts or comments, if I just removed your ""anything"" nobody will ever notice, and stuff like that not once, and my post clearly mentions this in the last image.

# My message to you MR.Mod

I genuinely don't care if got banned for 30 days or permanently, to me I think I was silenced and don't know what I should I avoid in the future to not be silenced again (hence vague rules and accusations that are only targeted at me), so about r/Egypt I'm totally over it now I will just forget about the whole experience and the existence of this sub as if I were permabanned.

Now, what I'm really curious about (this is for you u/Shrekthefatman):

* Do you really believe that I stalked her around Reddit?, did you actually saw a post on r/theredpill or any other written by me?, did you really see me linking any of our conversations before anywhere? (Hint I never even thought about it, not even close)
* Why do you always say things like I say hateful things against women and I harassed a female user on your sub, while her deleted comment is clearly and totally the other way around?, never mentioning her part of the story.
* Do you think that I'm the creep when she actually goes into my account every once in a while?, how did she even get this info about my posts when she has blocked me? (I actually unblocked her a while ago just to make sure she isn't posting about me on r/Egypt)
* I'm not gonna complain about it but if you do really care, after her deleted comment I was really traumatized, at least for a month I kept having PTSD triggers, felt unsafe and uneasy at the thought of my private life being violated like that, as I said before, I thought about deleting the whole account to not give any more information about myself, her comment really got me into deep cycles of depression cause I hated something I truly loved at first, finding Reddit, and I also hated how someone so remote can do such damage to me. I think this point is the same as the modmail which you mentioned. (Believing this or not is upon you)

It's either you truly believe I'm a cyber harasser, or you just lying.

For me I know you're lying, just forget about everything I said before, I'm just ultimately curious to know ""Why?"".

and an advice for the team of r/Egypt, if you confirmed a user to be an internet stalker, you should take your most forceful actions to stop this person, permabanning him/her and reporting to Reddit admins so his account is totally suspended from the whole website, this is not a matter of joke, **someone could get hurt from cyber bullying**.

This was my last stand, whether you clarify or not, whether people here think I'm right or wrong, whether r/Egypt becomes a healthy environment I could be part of in the future or not, I don't have any further info or clarifications, other than that, I'm not this type of a person you're accusing me to be.

I never even had any interaction with said user after I was banned from the sub the first time (which was after our argument), I never went to any men's right sub to post about her or any other person in particular, I was the one who actually felt really disturbed and uncomfortable being on r/Egypt after her faulty accusations and personal racist comments on me and my personal posts and comments on other subs.

She was the one who collected information from my posts on different subs to harass me with it and now she is lying saying that I actually followed her around and started to harass her and stuff like that, well the mod here said ""I don’t have these threads on me"" which makes his argument 0 effective.

(Hadn't the comment been deleted then we would have better understanding, but anyway it's a good thing it was)

and why didn't the team at r/Egypt notify me of such accusations of harassing other users on the sub?, I swear this didn't happen and I was the one who was traumatized after her bullying comment which got me to think I would delete the whole account of Reddit cause I feel like I'm wide open, my info could be used to kill me in that manner, so that was a good lesson I've learned.

>but we banned him for attacking other users who disagreed with him. Even though I personally didn’t think “incel” was a problem

I didn't think incel was a problem either, he flat out told me that we banned both of you for using such language, for me I don't care if she used whatever language me, as long as I can do the same. (To prove my point).

&#x200B;

>We deleted his threads because he was trying to make a validation thread  on why the mods were bad for banning him on his opinion,

My last deleted thread wasn't even about the mods, it was about the comments I received lately and some other comments on related topics (without mentioning anyone in particular) about an opposing idea and how it was treated differently, only raising a discussion without targeting anyone in particular, showing the users of r/Egypt both POV's, I didn't even bring myself the thread..

I only tried reasoning with the whole team, till the point when he just stopped talking about the whole point and just went into [this](https://ibb.co/6vb2m1Q). the kind of passive-aggressive speech isn't even my game, I can't just do it, It's either I go very calm and civilized, or I go full throttle insulting and stuff like that, the transition takes a lot of being insulted and attacked before me going out of control though.

Your problem is that you just assumed that I did something violating, they banned me, I cried about it like a baby just to get revenge, you assumed their rightness and my wrongness, you just called me a child, they did exactly the same, that's not a professional act of a mod, They didn't say anthing relevant for me to listen, you have all the info nothing I've hidden from you, show me how I didn't listen to them.

They downvoted too as I said, the proof is he just downvotes my comment on his comment after getting the notification, but that won't be good evidence for you.

If I got you right, you mean that it doesn't matter what people think of me, in the end I live the way I want applying my own rules on myself and people who would like to interact with me IRL.

Your example of Ahly and Zamalek is very on point to, always arguing, both think they are right, it will never happen that both will come to the same conclusion unless it's the Promised day, no one will ever be right nor wrong, it really isn't fair, as you said.

But for now this is how I stand for myself, I hate to see discrimination specially targeted at me and just move on even if it doesn't affect my life, it's not about the rights, it's about showing everyone how hypocrite could people get, I mean I only did what they always do, posted my heart out to feel heard, so that I can sleep while knowing everyone saw what happened, they understand what I meant now.

and actually this kind of abuse happens all the time IRL not only here on the sub, maybe I'm taking this post as a start for something new.

1. This woman is traumatized and will suffer from PTSD for a long time in her life
2. No one approve harassment whatsoever, still if you are in a foreign country it's a nice thing to follow by its rules and clothing as a sign of respect, if you didn't then no problem, we won't judge you, we won't harass you, criminals are exception to previous statement though (I actually tried to elaborate this before but got accused of gas-lighting women. the total opposite)
3. Egypt contain the good and bad, like any place worldwide, some tried to harass her, some tried to save her, and call me blind but the most are of the helper kind.

Now for the people who commented:

1. Those who are blaming her are just attention seekers / suckers for an argument
2. Those who are attacking the previous ones are mostly hypocrites, (Don't even get me started on a man calling another an incel)
