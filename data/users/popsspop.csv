Apparently I blocked it out.but anyway.  I remember thinking it's so weird how ""normal"" he looks. Legit was just sleeping.  That made me at ease.  I didn't cry for 6 months.  It definitely fucked me in life losing him but I always am grateful of the awesome stories I hear and seeing him go to sleep.

nba,ffvr9mq,t1_ffvojz1,1580271028.0,Yeah im so confused.  Ppl are saying he lost control or was flying by sight and thought down was up. How you do think you are going up if the meter in front of your face is showing you losing altitude.  Did he legit not look at anything or do the meters turn off when the pilots wants?

LifeProTips,ffea2b9,t1_ffe9r8a,1579840893.0,"Yea i figured yours was def way more intense. Mine were cut out right where they start to ""curve"" into the skin on both sides of each nail .

LifeProTips,ffe9v9a,t1_ffe6n4g,1579840726.0,I agree.  I couldn't believe how much it hurt. I thought it would be at worst like a dental needle. Nope. This was insane.

While I'm pleading to save the last of his money his number hits. With 200on the #(got a settlement so we were young and with a lot of money) . Anyway he was playing same  4 numbers every spin and the intersections.  Long story short he won 25k in like 10 minutes.  Out of the numbers displayed on the board he hit lije 8 of them. We got comped another week in a suite at the rio. I said fuck classes. I had a photo on my old iPhone of 100 bills laid out perfectly covering the king size bed. We threw them up in the air after and danced around the room for like a hour. It was insane.  Then the escorts arrived and knocked at the door. we have to kick it all under the couch as it was legit everywhere and couldn't gather neatly. Fuck man I'll never forget that Halloween in vegas

LifeProTips,ffe466c,t1_ffe3wjp,1579836232.0,I had done on both big toes. The needle hurt more than procedure.  Mine didnt hurt at all healing. Both nails cut to root and then acid was applied.  I still have a nail just the sides are gone

nfl,fefd1kn,t1_fefbcy5,1579053688.0,Yeah this 3x should be multiplied by like 2 or 3 AT THE LEAST. High school never gets reported properly and college pretty much the same.

nfl,fe3du5p,t1_fe2z9nz,1578848405.0,"Take this from a ravens guy. Any ""bad"" result by the ravens was bc you guys made that happen. Jackson looked nervous af out there. Even his outbursts on the sideline felt forced bc he knew there was a camera on him. He looked completly shook to me. Great gamelan not rushing and make him have to make some throws , which he can't do consistently . Hats off to you guys, I want yall to go all the way"
nfl,fe3c7rj,t1_fe37r32,1578847996.0,I have been telling ppl the ravens have a very short window. Once Jackson can no longer produce video game runs and it forced to make throws their chances are over . Sure They may make the playoffs his entire career but will never beat solid defenses in crunch time. And I'm a ravens guy.
nfl,fe056iq,t1_fe0267b,1578803337.0,I mean it was a high throw. Put it on his chest for the guy who can't jump.  I'm a ravents but dam Lamar was awful tonight

But anyway You used way too much or didnt use properly. Or the shoes had maybe a color paste that was removed. I'm not sure how you would even notice dye being removed unless you tried to dry off with a towel or somthing.  I put a little on and rub in then hit with the horsehair. Never removed dye for me. Maybe a little cream , which water can do as well."
personalfinance,fdxg4xl,t3_en755z,1578768418.0,Top upvote comment is incorrect.  Contact the other person ins and have them admit fault. Then you deal with the other company yourself . Calling your ins only adds another person to bog down the process. Insurance is simple. I don't know people act like its as big bad business. We are regulated by state and federal regulation.
personalfinance,fdxfhky,t1_fdvqbji,1578768207.0,"No. I'm a agent. Call the other insurance company with the person there and have them admit it is there fault, as this was. Go straight to the other company. Adding anither rep in the process simply slows it down."
todayilearned,fdpuuv4,t1_fdpk1yo,1578641426.0,If youre that hungover more than once fom drinking you deserve the hangover. I lived through west Virginia univ top 5 football/ bball days in the late 2000s(#1party school). Drank heavily Tues to Sunday and was hung over to the point of not even being able to sip water 1 Or 2 times. I'm talking blacked out Roman candle fireworks fights involving the entire block when Osama was killed.  If you drink to the point of not being able to sip water the nexxt day you need to schedule more appointments than a I.v .   You need Psychological help.
