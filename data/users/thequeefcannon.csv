Reston,fd4e5c7,t3_ejm57l,1578166779.0,"I live near NorthPoint Shopping center in Reston and I have had to cover for a co-worker out in Manassas a few times this last year. I had to be there onsite by 8AM and that drive took me about 30 minutes if I leave by 7:25AM. The commute was to Mike Garcia Dr, Old Town Manassas. I hope this info helps you! I'd honestly use the Waze app and set the address from Reston to (insert job location) at the desired time of arrival, to get a more accurate idea of the commute though. Reston Rocks! Hope you join us out here! : )"

aww,fclv2po,t1_fckj4y5,1577757175.0,"Whoa. That I did not know. I wasn't present, but when I told my wife this, she said she knew that washing her hands was necessary. Cute as it was, next year it'll have to be some safer/cleaner LEDs or something. Thanks for the link!"

aww,fcjbw7q,t3_ehgw2s,1577682488.0,"Since People seemed concerned, I feel like I should clarify that this was highly supervised by my wife, who is a NICU nurse (for what that's worth) and her mother, and that the lights were neither hot nor on her for more than a few seconds. Thanks for the concern, but lets not be dramatic. Thanks!"
aww,fcjbhg6,t1_fcj8ldj,1577682151.0,Lol thanks for the tip. It was highly supervised by my wife.

Thanks to his actions, I now make good money and love going to work every day. I'm the happiest I've ever been, and its because I don't work for any assholes : )"
