MaddenUltimateTeam,fdegngv,t3_ekvn5p,1578338610.0,Zeitler is long overdue for an upgrade.
NYGiants,fddvvvs,t1_fddssv8,1578325264.0,Exactly
NYGiants,fd08chu,t1_fcyqjl6,1578115148.0,Except that's not the scenario.  Giving up a 3rd rounder was not a prerequisite for signing him this off-season.  You present a false narrative.
NYGiants,fd0850a,t3_ejkovt,1578115061.0,"I think people here are really missing the point.  Leonard's play for the Giants this past season gave absolutely no value to the franchise because we were already out of the playoff picture when the trade was made.  Any contribution Leonard gives the team going forward if he signs with us is the same contribution the team would have received if the trade was never made and signed him in free agency, since he became a free agent at the end of the season.  Stating that a third-round pick would probably not generate a starting-caliber player might be true but totally misses the point of the pick's value.  An early third-round pick could easily turn out to be a good player, or we could use the pick to acquire a current player or move up into the late first round by coupling the pick with our second-round pick.  Just because a third-round pick could end up being a middling player added to the 2020 roster totally diminishes the overall value of the pick by only recognizing the potential negative outcome.  Focusing on the third-round pick also ignores the value we lost with the fourth or fifth round pick that was included in the trade, as well as ignoring the insane leverage Leonard has in negotiating a potential deal with the Giants knowing the Gettleman wants to save face.  The merit of Gettleman's other moves are certainly up for debate, but I think objectively there is no defending the Leonard Williams trade with a straight face."

NYGiants,fckk9r4,t3_ehofkf,1577727167.0,"If he could offer the same offensive creativity to the Giants skill players as he did in KC, I'm all for it.  Bienemy and Rhule are my top two choices."
NYGiants,fckjz6i,t3_ehomfj,1577726988.0,Smell ya later
NYGiants,fckjvux,t3_ehor2r,1577726931.0,"A lot of people are missing the point that we could have signed him without trading for him, thus losing no draft picks and not handing him insane leverage in the negotiations.  These are not mutually exclusive propositions.  That third round pick would have been the fourth pick in the third round, so it would have had plenty of value, even as a trade chip."
NYGiants,fcinmx8,t3_eha3jr,1577665624.0,see you next season
pics,fcimgc6,t3_eh5lq4,1577665023.0,I'd still win in a fight.  I've been eating a lot of protein.
NYGiants,fcilzd0,t1_fcijq7o,1577664795.0,Nope.
NYGiants,fcikhnh,t3_eha3jr,1577664077.0,This season was bought at the toilet store.

NYGiants,fc4515v,t1_fc3q55d,1577406814.0,Quite possibly.  It wouldn't upset me at all if he were let go.
NYGiants,fc3hm1u,t1_fc39nxj,1577389981.0,"You're right, my mistake."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc1j20q,t3_efnjnx,1577320241.0,I like to run this play on defense.  You can beat the FS deep because the FS plays in a purple zone and the cornerback on that side is the only one playing deep.
cats,fc11wwz,t3_efiwum,1577305909.0,You are awesome.
NYKnicks,fc0yl62,t3_effbxe,1577303205.0,If he only knew.
