Dude. The reason for that is literally the Prequels. The primary purpose for them was an advertisement for the tech that George Lucas owned. 

No one seems to remember all the commercials that played before movies that featured George Lucas saying how powerful computer powered graphics are.

I don't think anyone ""fakes"" depression. There is no malice involved. I think the issue is that people go through tough times and then think they're depressed instead of thinking that they just went through tough times. 

It's ok to suffer as a teen. It's ok to feel like shit for a while. That doesn't mean you are broken and need help. It just means that you're teen and life sucks. Which is how pretty much teenage life just goes.

What I'm getting at is that everyone feels like shit as a teen but only a very very small percent are mentally ill. Most are just being teens. Which sucks. And makes you question your sanity. We shouldn't tell teens that they actually have issues with their sanity. That makes them delve into believing it and creating it.

What I'm saying is that since teens are experiencing adulthood for the first time, we should hold their hands and say that sometimes life sucks and not say that they are broken and can never escape the spiral of their brokenness. 

I'm also going to extend what I said to ""20 somethings"". Modern culture pushes adulthood and self-sufficiency even older. Same problems. It's hard being on your own but that's just how it is."
unpopularopinion,few98nv,t1_feuwbho,1579407043.0,"> I'm pretty sure that most people aren't faking their depression, although it doesn't mean that they have clinical depression: it means that they have a problem and they don't know how to address it.

You've described my point from the other side. The word ""depression"" has come to mean ""feeling sad for a while"". That's not what depression is. Depression is a long term inability to feel *anything*. It's not sadness. It's just a step above a coma. 

Having a problem doesn't make you depressed. If you're sad for a long time about a problem, you're sad because you have a problem. Depression isn't cause and effect with problems. You can have everything you want and still be depressed. Which again I must emphasize is not feeling unfulfilled or sad or unsatisfied. Depression is a waking coma. 

If a teen comes to a psychiatrist and says ""I'm sad a whole lot"" the answer is not ""Gee wiz, lemme give you SSRIs"". It's to talk it out. They're not mentally ill. They're sad. Mental illness is like cancer. It takes years of routine intervention and there's no guarantee it will succeed. 

The hardest thing anyone will hear is that they're not special. That includes *not* being mentally ill. You're like the rest of us. We deal with it, you need to too. 

Let me be clear, I'm not saying to shrug off anyone who comes for help. I'm saying to do the opposite. If someone is having a tough time in life, help them out. Be a shoulder to cry on. Be a sympathetic ear. Don't traumatize them by saying that they are ill. They're just going through life like we all do. To assume that most people are irreparably damaged makes damage when none existed before."

Here's something for you to chew on: Just because someone is diagnosed with something, it doesn't mean they are something. You can't take a blood test for mental illness. You can't measure feelings. The DSM-5 is fallible, mutable, and totally up to the interpretation of whoever is using it."
unpopularopinion,fete40m,t1_fescp71,1579374448.0,"Since this is /r/unpopularopinion, here's an unpopular opinion. More people are harmed by this culture of glorifying mental illness than are helped by it. People who are ill are getting unprecedented support but that's a very small part of the population. There are more people who aren't ill but told they are because they feel sad sometimes or nervous when meeting new people. It's like back in the 90s where every kid that preferred to run around outside than sit in a classroom had ADD and should be stuffed full of Ritalin until they can't even move.  Nobody's perfect but that doesn't mean everyone is broken.

That's ironic you should say that since the whole point of teaching kids advanced math is so that they can understand finance. Finance changes but math doesn't.

Nowadays what is right and what is wrong is disgustingly bipartisan. New Picard can't be ""moral"" if he doesn't take a side and if he does, he'll cease to be the timeless character that does what is right no matter how hard it is. He'll just be another political puppet for this fucked up era."

In the past, you would only be judged against your peers if you voluntarily met them and chose to see them. Like if you met Jenny from high school, you'd probably tell her to fuck off and continue on living your own life where you don't need know what the fuck Jenny is doing every day. Today, everyone has social media and everyone has a smart phone, so whatever the fuck Jenny is doing is yelled at you every moment of every day. It's especially bad for kids who don't now how to separate themselves from their social media appearance. They really honestly care what some stupid website shows of them."

movies,fd6vyzn,t3_ejyn26,1578196419.0,"I'm not sure it counts as ""facts"" but Ad Astra had such horrible physics all the way through that it was hard to watch. The worst part is that it didn't need to fuck up as bad as it did in order to further the plot. I can forgive movies like Armageddon which don't give a fuck and just want to dazzle the audience with explosions and adventure. Ad Astra wanted to be a slow contemplative movie but then had Armageddon style physics. It wasn't integral to the story to have such bad physics. Armageddon couldn't work if it was faithful to reality. Ad Astra could have been. That's why it's worse."

politics,fczh1gu,t1_fczb3zx,1578101077.0,"Iran as a state would fall incredibly quick. A war between states would end within a week. The US has more firepower than it knows what to do with. Every target that is presented as military would be blown to fuck in a day. Then there would be boots on the ground the next day. The US military is designed around destroying hard targets and then occupying the ruins. It's incredibly good at doing that. There is absolutely nothing Iran can do to stop it. 

The issue is what happens next. So the state has fallen, what does the US do next? Try to rebuild it in a way that it turns into an ally?

The reason why you should be opposed to this conflict isn't because of the threat Iran poses to the US military. It should be about what happens after."
