LIRR,fds2la0,t1_fds21so,1578693378.0,"Yea unfortunately you are right. I have been chasing dead ends all morning. All of them ending up with “you have to go in person to the L&F office in Penn”


Weird that you can’t call. 


Also annoying that if I noticed this right away there isn’t a number I can call where they can radio to the train to have someone check.  They specifically say on the website that they will not do this for “safety reasons”....huh?


Ughhhhh! There isn’t a more violating feeling than someone else potentially going through all of your stuff."

LIRR,fdp2gv8,t1_fdp2d45,1578618422.0,Thanks for that. I am definitely going to. I don’t put much faith in their automated system.

Damnthatsinteresting,fdojs0w,t1_fdnutei,1578606564.0,Why is there even a blade specifically made for mat cutting? That seems comical to me. Is there any practical use? I can’t envision two people walking down an alley and a mat attacks them and they wish they had their mat cutting sword...
