Neither was master chief or Jedi or sith, HOWEVER in clone wars, the show, it is said that a single Jedi is worth a 1000 soldiers. I'd wager that the same statement about some Mandalorians. Not all, but how many bigger better opponents you think Djin took down in past jobs. He fights smarter, not harder. He took a tie fighter down on foot dude. On foot. Rey did that too. I've never seen a storm trooper do that. Did he walk out lone gunman against a platoon of death troopers? No, a plan was made and it succeeded, due to outthinking the opponents. So he can shrug of some blaster fire, that's not far fetched, there is high caliber round body armor in the world where someone can mow down police, trained police, while taking rounds and continuing to fire. It's the same concept, he has the armor, the weapons, the smarts, and the experience to outclass all but the most battle hardened opponents and storm troopers are fodder with shoddy armor who have basic military training at best. Death troopers, the special forces, almost won but smarts won out there too. Not an infallible hero but a very definition of a legendary hunter. Why's he so expensive? He gets the job done and he's the best at what he does. He was about to lose when a Mando squad came in and rescued his ass, so he's far from undefeatable. Could you defeat a UFC fighter in a fight? No, they're pros. Same concept."

Beskar is like wearing a tank, mandalorians don't just do it because it looks ""ah pretty cool"" they have reasons and laser, light saber, explosion resistance is that reason. Is the armor pretty OP? Absolutely, but Mandalorians are OP already. have you ever read the Mandalore stuff? It's crazy. Weapons, armor, that's their religion, not job not antything else, it's their religion. of course Mando know some shit E-11 blaster won't pierce that armor he's got. Think about it this way

Mando is the best, according to the rumors right? So how is it so shocking or boring when a clearly PROVEN OP CHARACTER is being OP. That's the point I think. They are OP when lasers bounce off absolutely, but that's part of what made them OP in the first place. He acts reckless at times because he knows he's not in as much danger as it might seem.

Mandalorian,feepvrx,t3_eokgw6,1579038709.0,"To be honest, the .22 was a real world scale comment, not how powerful I think the weapons are jsyk. You got way too literal with the metaphor. I would obviously think a storms firing what is more powerful than a .22. You kinda missed my hollowpoint. The empire has to mass produce weapons on a massive scale. So it makes sense that they would go to someone making cheap and affordable weapons that they will give standard throwaway soldiers. Or if they are manufactured by the empire, they are basically garbage.In addition, storm trooper armor may also be trash and the helmets may throw off the vision defect style just enough that no one wearing a ST helmet could shoot anyways. The empire relied on pure numbers, horde  style, they had to dump money into a galactic death weapon, they didn't have spare credits to waste on ""viable weaponry"" isn't that tech the empire uses from the republic era anyway. Tech does improve with time. Maybe the rest of the galaxy kept with the new models of blaster and the storm troopers, with their old war relic weapons and armor are just signs of an obsolete technology that the emperor is just too cheap to replace. He has millions of soldiers, they definitely aren't all getting gold plated blasters. PLUS, they are probably not able to make mods to their weapon as that is work property and any tampering will get you killed. Now the rest of the galaxy is using ""modern or modified tech"" and the empire is using dated tech, which was less powerful. And knowingly, so you can't say they wouldn't do that. The emperor absolutely is conceited enough to believe he has enough numbers on his side to forego powerful less defective more expensive weaponry. He doesn't care if the brain of every storm trooper is fried because their armor as a whole is flawed from the ground up.

I.e; jim has a full suit of swat armor, mp5, shotgun, tear gas the works.( jim is Mando)

John has civil war era muskets and a cardboard costume. (John is every storm trooper) 

Maybe the weakness of that armor is that it conducts the heat,electricity, plasma dispersion all over the body, stopping the heart or brain when a storm trooper is hit by a blast and it's purely by a coincidental design flaw that does that. Maybe palp knows and doesn't care. 

Evidence supports the helmet flaw. Both troopers who had BY were target shooting and missed in the same way. That's blocked vision, not bad accuracy. Clones probably trained and were all excellent marksman before they got in the armor. Maybe clone armor was better until they found a way to produce it cheaply and crappily.

And the general idea being that some transgenders are so surprised that Someone could tell when they HAVE to make that the first part of any conversation. We're past the era that only being trans makes a person special. I wanna congratulate the person, not their genitalia.  I don't care what you had, who you have sex with, if you identify as a pillow, any of that shtuff. So dance in drag as a man, doesn't mean I think you're a lady while doing it. Doesn't make it wrong either. I work with 2 ftm, who I call bro. Doesn't mean I think they were born men. Also doesn't matter, one opened with the I'm trans speech and the other just let things be like an unspoken. Telling people your trans is like telling someone ""hey I have a movie I wrote. Wanna read it? No need I'll read it to you."" Like assuming I give 2 honey buns about knowing what genitalia you were born with. 

It kind of feels like that statement ""hey I'm trans"" is like saying ""hey I'm expecting special treatment because I hate my original body and genitalia"" big deal. When you don't discriminate, getting the ""hey, I just met you and I happen to think you might discriminate against me because you have to know that I am in a class that has seen discrimination and you are possibly a discriminatory worthless piece of garbage who just might hate me based on some lowly standard of personal bias""  speech has worn me really thin.

I think people should continue to watch Nikki's tutorials because they're good, not because she's trans.
