People are different as a result of liking different things. It still doesn’t explain why people like the rude villagers."
AnimalCrossing,fftg6ij,t1_fftezni,1580219621.0,"Social anxiety, depression, a lack of feeling satisfyingly connected to others, as well as needing to work constantly to afford life."
abusiverelationships,fftfsjn,t3_eur2it,1580219300.0,"Just want to say that I find this metaphor a bit off. How about:
Candy seems so sweet and delicious, and has such alluring packaging. We’re taught that it’s normal and desirable as young impressionable children. But, once you take off the wrapper and put it in your mouth, your teeth you are slowly damaged, your blood sugar spikes, and you will always crash and be let down later. Eating it regularly increases your risk of several deadly diseases, and sugar is one of the most addictive substances. I know it feels like you want every carb when you try to go on a sugar cleanse, but after some time goes by, I promise, you will feel healthier, more stable, have more energy, and have a lot more self awareness regarding why you developed a sugar addiction. Stop eating the candy, stop buying the candy, and stop thinking you are satisfied eating garbage just because the few seconds of sweetness gives you some dopamine."
EnneagramType4,fftezx3,t1_ffta09n,1580218636.0,I know I do.
Borderline,fftdxxc,t1_ffstg9i,1580217717.0,"I’m curious if she knows that she is experiencing inappropriate emotions while it’s happening though. I usually can’t know until after the fact. 

That is confusing to me because nobody in group I know has shared this experience of thinking sad things are funny."
Borderline,ffslsia,t1_ffskrgh,1580184911.0,"Oh, okay. I am diagnosed with BPD and I do not experience that. I find myself over empathizing with things like that and sobbing about it for way too long. I don’t think I could ever laugh at that. But dumb jokes or annoying YouTube videos will make me DIE laughing, and I feel like an idiot for it when nobody else is laughing. 

Also, what I view as the suckiest part of this disorder is that when you do have inappropriate emotions, you BELIEVE they do fit. Example: I get super raged out when my bf does something that makes me feel like he doesn’t care (it’s always something small and innocent) and have no concept that I could be over reacting. The mood swings are POWERFUL and are reactive in nature, usually to a fear of abandonment. 

If you are aware that you’re changing, and your emotions don’t fit when you feel that way about that dog, then IMO it doesn’t sound like BPD.
But btw I would definitely NOT take my word and instead, for sure go see a therapist if you think you may have a personality disorder. 

Wishing you luck in figuring this out."
Borderline,ffsk2x2,t3_euzoh4,1580183648.0,I get the giggles sometimes. And facial expressions definitely change when you laugh. But why does that make you evil?

PanicAttack,ffmvxv8,t3_eu97hm,1580059493.0,"This is normal for people who have experiences multiple panic attacks. I have experienced this for months, and it is overwhelming at times, and just an awful experience all around. I am sorry to say, that the only way to help and reduce the frequency is to ride it out and be able to let yourself feel it. 

Specifically what do I mean? Don’t resist it. Remind yourself that they are not dangerous, and you will be 100% okay in about 20 minutes. Just sit and notice the increased heart rate, very warm temperature, shallow & rapid breathing, and tightening in your chest. Just notice and allow it. Find what helps you pay attention and ride it out. Sometimes walking in place helps me."
JUSTNOMIL,ffmgukl,t3_etzwtc,1580054481.0,I am so so sorry. Your MIL is insane and you deserve so much better. Here’s hoping you can convince your husband to cut her out of your life for this. She’s dangerous and toxic.
Enneagram,ffm0jcg,t1_fflrdgh,1580046662.0,"Yes, it’s a stereotypical behavior for 4’s to believe that other 4’s are mistyped. And you’re right about it not just being limited to 4’s. Back in high school I remember some kids from metal heads to Justin’s Bieber fans would feel that they are the Truest of fans. And in college, a guy I sat next to, who read *one* Shakespeare play, felt he knew more about literature than his peers ever would. — I regrettably felt this way as a (cringe attack) emo kid in high school. 

This has to do with trying to find out who you are, a desire to feel special, and feeling like you finally found something that could fit you, and you take it to an extreme where you unconsciously want it to define you to fill the void you have always felt in your heart. (I think normally people will do this in relationships in their youth. Some people just happen to do it with concepts and icons too.) This has a side effect of this kind of territorial boundary, where people try to assert that this is *their* thing and nobody else could ever do it like them. Because, if everyone could get into it, they wouldn’t be special like they finally felt when they found this thing (Bieber, emo, enneagram type, religion, sexuality, your first boyfriend, etc.) 

The reason why this is what 4’s do so (stereotypically) often, is because this type will often identify with a need to figure out who they are, and a giant need to feel unique, accompanied by intense emotions that they need to express, which is a combo that results in this cringeworthy feat. 

Sorry to everyone I just called out. Including myself."
Borderline,ffilmwp,t1_ffik9ws,1579976827.0,"In order to change something you need to be aware of it. Start a a note in your phone. Write down each time you have that voice—make sure to note if it happens when you’re alone, when your with him, when you haven’t seen him in a while, etc so you can learn your tiggers. Write down what the voice is bothered about, what it’s afraid of, what actions it wants you to take about it. Just write it down, don’t do anything about it.

Start practicing self care. Google “list of self care activities” I love to take long baths, listen to audio books, do yoga, walk/jog (even if it’s on a treadmill when it’s cold outside because even just walking lowers my anxiety so much), hang out with my friends, play with my cats, meditate, and play video games. There is so much more than that.

Google DBT skills. Watch some YouTube videos about it. 

Don’t hang out with him EVERY time you’re both available to do so— CHOOSE to live a life that is bigger than just him, yes include him, but don’t focus on him. Hobbies do help with this."
Borderline,ffijmmx,t1_ffihdo9,1579975441.0,"Yes. I was exactly the same way. That constant voice. That constant need for validation. I was always so easily hurt. And, honestly put, at times I was obsessed with him and what he was doing! Finally after two years (which is a crazy long time to put up with this) he left and he had to cut me out completely. Once he did that, it forced me to see my issues and face my fears and there was no way to deny it anymore and I focused on recovery. It’s even harder to recover while in a relationship because it’s so easy to keep backsliding, but it’s possible. 

Just remember: that voice, is lying to you. Do not act on your feelings. The more you focus on him, instead of yourself, the more you lose yourself and do harmful things."
PanicAttack,ffi2d7f,t1_ffhy7e3,1579963046.0,"Wow, nice work. That definitely seems like it would be helpful in reducing anxiety and the frequency of panic attacks. Do you have one every time you drink? Is it after the buzz wears off or during?"
EnneagramType4,ffh4w6l,t3_et7249,1579923193.0,"Pick one thing at a time to change. You aren’t as stuck or weird as you think you are, but you have to take small steps, one at a time, in order to fix your situation. 

There is nothing wrong with how you feel, (even though it can feel like a lot and overwhelm you, that’s okay. That’s just emotions. You’ve been living this way for a long time and it’s to be expected that you’ll feel resistance when you leave the comfort of your room. That will pass the more often you branch out and don’t act impulsively.) and you can’t and shouldn’t change how you feel. But how you feel should not stop you from doing what you want in life. Make a plan in one tiny area, and follow through. Little by little. 

Be your own guide/therapist/parent. You have everything you need inside of you, you just need to reach in and use it. If you get really honest with yourself, you will see that you are hirable, lovable, friendship material, not a victim, not stuck, and can get comfortable with social situations through practice."
Borderline,ffh2wes,t3_etevb7,1579921649.0,"I’m pretty sure every 16 year old girl with BPD that was in a relationship for longer than a few months behaved this way. It is a super common onslaught of symptoms, though it is overwhelmingly regrettable and destructive. 

After unknowingly forcing my first love out the door after being together for two years, this is the best advice I could have been given: 

-If you don’t see a psychologist who is trained in CBT on a constant weekly basis, start immediately. Go twice a week if you are self-harming. 
-If you haven’t researched and learned DBT skills, google/youtube it now. (Mindfulness, distress tolerance, interpersonal relationships, and emotional regulation—get tips in each category.)
-If you don’t know who Marsha Linehan is, go check her out. 
-join a DBT group if there are any near you.
-practice independence—the more time you spend making your boyfriend your everything, the more destructive you will be, and the quicker you will actually cause him to leave you. He is your partner, but you need to be a full person on your own, or else you will rely on him for too much and you will blow this whole thing up. 
-learn Self love and Self care.
-practice being okay completely alone. Turn your phone and laptop off to be truly alone. 
-encourage your boyfriend to have a full life and go do things with others regularly (as should you) 
-This one is ESSENTIAL but may need explaining. Hear me out. Here goes: Your feelings are not his responsibility whatsoever. Again, your feelings, are NOT his issue, they are yours alone. [Example: Yes, you feel hurt that he played Call of Duty all night and paid little attention to you. Even so, you have no right to demand he changes that. This is because, just like you, he gets to play his game if he wants. You’re not the only thing that matters in his life, and he shouldn’t be the only thing that matters in your life. You can ask kindly, ONCE, for attention at those times, but think of consent here.] He doesn’t have to do anything unnatural to him just to make you feel better. Ever. That is wrong. Remember, consent! If you are not happy with what he gives you, then you should leave, but no fights or guilt trips over innocent behaviors like this, ever! Imagine if a guy felt awful that you wouldn’t have sex so he argued with you and pressured you about it? It is grossly similar to make him feel bad for not giving you attention."

Notice the thought and notice what about it makes you anxious. Are you embarrassed about what happened? Are you worried that something you did makes you a bad person? Are you upset that something didn’t go your way? Identify why you are feeling anything about this memory. Then, be there with it. Feel that feeling. 

The last step is to acknowledge, and accept it and be kind yet realistic — “Yes, I did poorly on that test. It doesn’t change who I am, and I’m sure I could do better if I really studied and applied myself next time.” Or “My friend and I had an argument. Although it is painful, I know this happens between people, and I can only take responsibility for my part in this, and I have to accept it if they do not wish to take responsibility for their part.”"

So, I am being direct here because I need you to know this, if you don’t already: He is, and always will, try to take you down even if it brings him down too. It is a hyper focused insecure attachment and possibly a feeling of ownership, and is absolutely not love. (I hope you know by now that somebody who loves you would celebrate you and your happiness and success.) He is sick and will not get better as long as he’s with you (or anyone, because it lets him act on this and when people stay it helps normalize it) and you being so aware that a blow up will happen is proof that you’re developing PTSD. 

I would focus on work and school and becoming independent. He will react more and more strongly the happier, and more stable you become, so eventually you will need to safely separate and have an exit plan. Please start to plan."
EnneagramType4,ffbzhsb,t3_eslhfe,1579787601.0,Isn’t our core thing to want to feel special and also avoid abandonment? I think that stems from ultimately feeling insignificant.
Borderline,ffbz8zt,t3_esork6,1579787409.0,"People with BPD are typically reacting to other people or life events (in reality more like their their thoughts and feelings about other people and life events.) They tend to experience a lot of self hating thoughts and so many fearful thoughts about others. Also, because they experience their emotions at such an intense level, their mood can seem extreme and they have no control over their overwhelming emotions, and also have symptoms like poor impulse control and poor interpersonal relationships. It is a personality disorder. Years of CBT, DBT, and support from others can help. There is no medication designed to treat this, though some use it to reduce destructive symptoms and the accompanying depression and anxiety that almost always co-exists with this disorder. But, again, recovery comes from therapy. 

People with bipolar disorder will experience intense mood swings that they can not control as well (as you know there are different types of bipolar disorder) but the key difference is that it is not a reaction to other people or life events—it is a chemical change occurring in the brain. It is a mood disorder. Medications can help stabilize brain chemistry. CBT can help dealing with awareness and processing issues that may be a result of the disorder, though it is essential to find a helpful medication (and likely later changing it or increasing the dosage over time as your body will adapt to it.)

Something I am noticing are things that everybody has issues with: some assumptions that impact your quality of life, some issues with boundaries and attachment, and some general anxiety and uncertainty. 

I think it’s important for you to recognize how your perception of yourself, of your masculinity, on women, on power, and on relationships in general all exist the way they do in your mind because they served a purpose in helping your survival through your life, but they no longer serve you now that you are becoming a healthier adult. There are some perceptions that seem limiting and constricting to you, and also lead to what I mentioned above (assumptions, problems with boundaries and attachment, anxiety, and uncertainty.) — DBT and CBT are designed to help you with this. I think you could have some really cool experiences with yourself and in relationships down the line if you follow up your healthy lifestyle with some mental health work too.
