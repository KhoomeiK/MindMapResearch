AnimalsBeingJerks,ffpfv4k,t3_eud10w,1580094021.0,I leave my ladder out for the cats.  It is in my bedroom right in front of me with a cat on top.
changemyview,ffpfhgb,t3_euguua,1580093750.0,"It is offensive to me too.  The others who died are just numbers.  People will follow anyone who is rich anywhere.  Blind adoration.  It is depressing.  People on the streets with no money to even feed a dog and yet we idolize multi millionaires and billionaires.  I just don’t understand any of it.  They hand together in their billion dollar circles and people without teeth bow the fuck down to them.  Like Obama is a man of the poor.  He spends his days cruising the world with B B B B B Billionaires.  People are dumb.

He was a good basketball player.  That is neat."
