todayilearned,ff4kyak,t1_ff4de8s,1579566124.0,"Goalies were undoubtedly worse, for three reasons:

1. They relied a lot more heavily on reflexes
2. Their ability to get from side-to-side was SIGNIFICANTLY worse than today's goalies, particularly for down-low one-timers
3. The general technique 30 years ago was much more geared toward ""see the puck, move to stop the puck,"" which made for larger and less-efficient movements.  Nowadays it's ""position yourself where the puck is statistically most likely to hit you in X situation.""

Plus the equipment was light-years inferior.  (EDIT -- I held a leg pad from the '80's once ... holy shit that thing must have weighed 15 lbs).

*source: played goalie in the '00's, when a lot of these changes really took hold*"

I'm much stronger than at age 20 (and I was lifting back then, too), can sprint faster, and am just barely slower at distance running (partly because I gained weight as a result of the lifting).

assholedesign,fcjyd42,t1_fcjxko4,1577710398.0,"Excellent question.  The [answer](https://depts.washington.edu/matseed/batteries/MSE/components.html) is that the anode actually oxidizes when the battery is providing power; to recharge the battery, the anode must be reduced back to its original state.

Likewise, the cathode is reduced during this process, and so needs to be oxidized to regain charge in the battery.

So yeah, the battery is constantly undergoing a series of chemical reactions.  Makes it pretty amazing to think about research like [this](https://www.greencarcongress.com/2019/09/20190927-dahn.html), where the battery can withstand multiple thousands of charge/recharge cycles with minimal degradation.

(edit: based on articles I've been reading over the last 3-4 months, I'm guessing that said research is going to hit the market via Tesla in the next year or so.  Exciting times)."

Yup.  My grandma did that sometimes (very much a generational thing), and I always hated it.  Seven-year-old me was like ""look, I just overestimated how hungry I was, okay?""

My wife and I are trying to stay away from that mentality; we make our 3-year-old eat at least a couple bites of whatever he took, but beyond that, we very explicitly tell him ""Eat as much as you want, but you can stop eating when you're full.""

So sometimes he pigs out and goes back for seconds or even thirds, and other times he leaves most of his food untouched -- but the important thing is, he's learning the the concept of *enough*.
