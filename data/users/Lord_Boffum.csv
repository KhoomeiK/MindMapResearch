E: was on mobile, I'll elaborate. You take a special long-triangle-shaped file, and you file a straight groove in the middle of the nail. Apparently, this causes the nail to 'retreat' to the middle, giving the opportunity for a sort of do-over when it comes to not growing into the skin at the side.
