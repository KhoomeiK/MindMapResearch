Hair,fep34do,t3_eq4fj4,1579311062.0,I do Goldwell keratin treatments are home. Can be washed/tucked behind ears within minutes.
poshmark,fep2dqa,t3_eq88pb,1579310595.0,She didn’t like it. People suck.
poshmark,feoz8fy,t3_eq8uxo,1579308603.0,I have several. But a sweatershaver was better than anything else. More time but better results. Just search on amazon and look for anything with good ratings that fits your needs.
poshmark,feoyvzs,t3_eq8xz7,1579308390.0,"Hard to tell from the vid... I’m pretty new too so other posters might have better advice.

Personally I find that anything without a household name brand sells for very little. J.crew, lululemon, Frye, Roth’s are the only items I feel like I get asking price for, and my closet is full of that stuff white zero likes too"
poshmark,feoy3d1,t1_feoxutt,1579307893.0,Yay! Thanks!
poshmark,feopjna,t1_feoowo6,1579303550.0,"Awesome, in theory I agree 100%. Kind of new o the app. I know a consignment store wouldn’t tell me if DCO, stuff has been only dry cleaned. I do value honesty, but agree with your points. I think I’ll be choosy when over delivering info. Thank you!"
poshmark,feoov7x,t1_feoor8n,1579303273.0,I would also steam it... just me.
poshmark,feoof98,t1_feoo72r,1579303027.0,Perfect! Thank you!!!

poshmark,feojrhi,t3_eq76ca,1579301101.0,Laser cut blouse.
poshmark,feohbui,t3_eq1lbo,1579300140.0,"I don’t even schedule pickups anymore. My mail dude is super cool and told me I don’t need to, that it is their job to check and see if things are deliveries or outgoing... HOWEVER, unless you have a good relationship with your carrier I would check or put a post it like other commenters suggested. 

PRO TIP: I get my mail carrier little things like $5 coffee gift certificates and or a candy bar about once a month. And I gave him treats to give to my dog.  We’re like a weird family now where he just brings or takes away things every day while getting a little love from my lab mix."
poshmark,feoeq3u,t3_enq3hk,1579299110.0,"Hi! I have lots of items (mostly j crew) items in my closet—@bethhhhy —they are literally from my closet so large (8-12) tall sizes are the norm. Also a little makeup from FFF/Ipsy that I opened but haven’t used. I have TONS of stuff left to steam, then post so check back when you want to browse!"
