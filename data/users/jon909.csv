Thank god we don’t rely on that for evidence. Case closed. I’m not preaching anything. You’ve yet to tell me who you’re prosecuting and what evidence you have against them. You can’t even provide a suspect in the murder you’re pushing. Until then you just look silly.

Serious question. Let’s pretend you're a prosecutor with full authority beyond our judicial system. What the fuck are you going to do. Who are you going to prosecute. With what evidence. I’m dying to know."
unpopularopinion,fdzr2n3,t1_fdpt61o,1578793851.0,"I’m not defending anyone. I’m defending the judicial process of if you are accusing me of something you’d better have goddamn proof. This takes a certain level of critical thinking beyond our feelings on the matter. There’s a process. It’s a good process. You can’t just lock people up without proof. The silly thing is you don’t even have a suspect. You don’t even have any proof. But you are steadfast convinced he didn’t kill himself because it fits your agenda. That’s not an accurate way to think, and thank god it’s not the way our judicial system works otherwise half of us would be locked up on bullshit. You’re realizing your argument is running thin so you turn to the petty insults saying I support Epstein. Bullshit. Have a better argument. You’re better than that."
worldnews,fdpqdgc,t3_emhnai,1578636540.0,"VERB

posturing (present participle)


behave in a way that is intended to impress or mislead.
""a billionaire posturing as a hero of the working class""


synonyms:
pose · strike an attitude · put on airs · attitudinize · behave affectedly · strut · show off · cop an attitude · hot-dog"
unpopularopinion,fdpnenm,t1_fdplhnr,1578633653.0,"“He clearly didn’t kill himself”

Clearly would be clear evidence. Maybe he did maybe he didn’t. You can’t convict on coincidence otherwise a lot more people would be in jail. You have no suspect and no evidence. That’s just absurd to me that you find that “clear”. You have a powerful guy who was a pedophile who ran in circles with other powerful people and that’s your clear evidence? 

So what’s your suggestion here? Should we change our judicial process and start convicting on assumption and coincidence? Or should we continue to require a strict process of proof by evidence? You can’t have your cake and eat it too. I think it’s irresponsible to assume anything until there’s actual clear evidence, no matter how much I dislike someone and want them locked up. I can’t let my bias interfere with the judicial process and I think that’s what you’re doing here."
unpopularopinion,fdpighz,t1_fdpb6it,1578629502.0,This is a bad argument I hate that people make. If any one of us were suddenly given billions in assets today we’d be several lawsuits deep tomorrow by simply having billions in assets. If you have money you are going to be investigated and sued. Just part of being wealthy. Everyone wants a piece of the pie plus your risk/liability skyrockets with multiple investments of which most you don’t control the day to day operations.

Yes I know humans don’t like fires. That’s not my point. A lot of “saving the world” when people talk is really “we want a comfortable place to live and want to save ourselves”. If what’s best for the environment is for it to burn down and regrow nobody is going to like that. But that’s kinda my point. We pick and decide off hubris what is best for earth but really those decisions revolve around how to keep us comfortable, not necessarily what’s best for earth."
