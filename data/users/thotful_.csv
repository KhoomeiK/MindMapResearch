She’s a wonderful person. She said ‘you need to be a daddy’. She wanted to do that for me as a present. It’s a gift.

a lot of people will just go ""heh"" and leave it at that, but I'm sure many more are reconsidering the blatant false narrative that was disseminated during pizzagate and even seemingly unrelated stories. it's like a gateway conspiracy meme, and it's so popular now that conspiracy theorists can finally hang their hat on something -- 'you think the government wouldn't protect or encourage elite pedophiles? look at epstein' 'you think the royal family isn't engaged in pedophilia? look at prince andrew?'

In this book, she talks about how she was violently abused in order to traumatize her to the point of becoming helpless and easy to control. She talks about how politicians would sell her body to other people of interest for their various perversions as collateral to gain political control (many of these interactions were filmed). The book is fascinating but very disturbing.
