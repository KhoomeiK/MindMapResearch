eu4,fdunbgt,t1_fdrcx64,1578735717.0,Today is the first time I actually really read the name New-Found-Land ... yay me... #mindblown

factorio,fc2mj8a,t1_fc2mexi,1577367150.0,Think EU4 and CK2 are quite a few steps out from these lighter games and I found them more fun. Recommend to try out if you liked Stellaris.
