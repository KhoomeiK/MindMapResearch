ForzaHorizon,feeoc9l,t1_febxchm,1579037819.0,"I too use the braking line in races and never anywhere else. Even if the braking line is on for waypoints in free drive, the drive is better and I’m sticking the road (on simulation settings). All of my tunes are for stability and act as such outside of races. That’s why I’m so confused by the oversteer and slideyness/fishtail in race with the same speed and braking habits. Really frustrating."
