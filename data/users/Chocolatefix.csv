I remember hearing the term ""addicted to anxiety"" a few years ago and it really made me try to understand why I did the things I did. Procrastinating, waiting till the last minute, rushing around was how I normally did things. 

When I sat back and was honest with myself I had to admit that I HATED feeling that way and just because I was used to feeling crushed by anxiety doesn't mean I had to keep enduring it. I made small steps to make sure I did things in reasonable times and that I wasn't waiting last minute to do the things I needed to create situations that would cause me to be anxious. 

I'm not all the way there yet but I'm a lot better than I used to be.
