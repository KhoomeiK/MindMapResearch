oklahoma,ffcshog,t1_ffcqpx0,1579806347.0,Ok that's fair. I appreciate you sharing your view
oklahoma,ffcpggd,t1_ffcl33a,1579804425.0,Thank you for sharing. So most other states do not have a 20% exclusivity fee. My question is though why are people in this thread against stitt trying to get higher exclusivity fees from them? More money from casinos will only help the state of Oklahoma
oklahoma,ffckdbc,t1_ffce83g,1579801311.0,"I agree with you. Also I do not want an out of state casino coming into Oklahoma. What Stitt is trying to do is get the casinos to pay more in taxes just like they do everywhere else. In oklahoma casinos pay 4-6% on slots which is where they make most their money and 10% on table games. Stitt is asking the casinos to pay 20-25%.

 Why are people against stitt trying to get more tax money from casinos?

If you scroll down you can see where it says stitt wants 20-25%"
oklahoma,ffcbu3m,t1_ffc7yph,1579796071.0,"I agree with this too. I have worked in the casinos for 6 years including a very large one. The amount of money they make is just insane and people dont really realize it unless you worked inside one. Right now the tribes are paying 4-10% tax where others states with game casinos pay upwards of 20% tax. Theres a large casino that has offered to come to oklahoma and pay the 20% but that cant happen with the way tribal gaming is set up

In 2019 casinos in Oklahoma paid 150 million in tax, I am very thankful so much money has went to the state but lets assume they all paid 10% which they didnt however that would be 1.5 billion casinos made in profit in Oklahoma! That's so gross. The one large casino I worked for would would have quarterly meetings where everyone had to attend and they would just speak about how much money they are making for 2 hours. One quarter they made 180 mil their best at the time while paying us blackjack and craps dealers a measly 6$ an hour. 

I have since finally got out of the casino business. It destroys homes and it sucks money from the poor who cant afford it, watching people be in there for 3 days straight without changing clothes, it's like a drug. 

However I am grateful its brought so much tax money to the state and I believe casinos should be paying more up to 20% just like other states. So I do not understand why people are against stitt trying to get more money from these gaming giants."

GetMotivated,fe706og,t1_fe6w9mj,1578908306.0,Thank you!! And I lost 30 pounds. Like a win win! Do good things and good things will happen. I am sorry to hear about your family. My father also drinks every single day. And I dont think he will ever quit. It's just hard man it took me till my mid 30s to get ahold of it
GetMotivated,fe6xq7a,t1_fe6vt5x,1578907411.0,Dude disc golfing is where its at!! I'm kinda in south US so we been playing all winter since it's not too cold. Get in r/discgolf for motivation theres fools out there in the snow banging chains! And Jomezpro on YouTube has most major coverage of the events. I believe the first of the major event is in feburary at Las vegas and I'm 95% sure jomez will cover it so you can watch the entire event free on YouTube
GetMotivated,fe6uvyl,t1_fe6spum,1578905685.0,"Honestly I kinda had to make new friends and stop hanging out with my drinking friends. Like we still talk and if they go somewhere with food I'll meet them there just to eat and usually leave shortly after. That's kind of rare though since I just try to avoid drinking situations, just for now you know. My favorite thing to do is fishing so I quit drinking in spring when fishing was on here! I would go every weekend by myself and I made a friend at the docks my age who also didnt drink so then we would both go like every weekend. I also really love to disc golf. Theres quite a few golfers who drink but I have met a whole crew of guys at the course now that dont drink and we meet up to go play like every few days. 

My advice is go do hobbies you already like but go alone at first and meet new people there who have the same goals as you. Then just keep growing from there :)"

Edit: Thank you!! My first silver, I feel like a star."
