Type 55s are cruisers. Ticonderoga class are also cruisers, which have been battle proven.

Edit: forgot to mention, China has not developed a quad packed missile system. The sea sparrow is quad packed, meaning 4 missiles can be stored in a tube. This greatly increases the Burke’s defensive and anti missile capability."
