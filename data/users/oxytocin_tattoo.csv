He ran toward me, but then he ran under my car instead. I didn't move, but I held my hand out to the ground and he came over to get pets. I picked him up, and hugged him, and I was starting to cry because I was so happy, and then he saw the tuna I'd put out to try and lure him, LOL. He just about tore my legs up trying to get at it. You guys, I was seriously crying I was so happy.

relationship_advice,fcsbl6n,t1_fcrwrtx,1577914260.0,"I know this is too late to help with the current situation, but I really hope in the future if you know someone who is ""such a good liar"" that you don't feel like you can ask a question and know you're getting a straight answer, please don't trust that person with something like the keys to your apartment. This is your safety, and you deserve so much better."

memes,fcos770,t1_fcorx6i,1577840125.0,"Men's breasts are exactly as sexual as women's. You say men can't go around shirtless ""everywhere"" but women can't go shirtless anywhere without harassment and there's no objective reason for that. There are, in fact, objective reasons for women to pull out their breasts in public for non-sexual uses, yet we get harassed for it.

>The other body parts you are listing are not inherently sexual and only fetishists think otherwise.

""Fetishists"" and most of Western society for the last several hundred years."
memes,fcorluw,t1_fcor03p,1577839674.0,">Idk what universe you're from but going barefoot is not sexualized at all. That's why foot fetishists are seen as creepy freaks. I would hear your case for midriffs but they are barely sexualized. 

Literally the point I was making. Any body part can be sexual, but society has arbitrarily decided breasts are taboo, while feet, thighs and midriffs are not. If society decided to lift the arbitrary ban on breasts (like we did on midriffs, thighs, arms, ankles, etc. before), there would be no objective reason not to walk around topless."
entitledparents,fcor56i,t1_fcoe9w6,1577839328.0,"My family is part Italian (Sicilian) and part Irish ancestry, with the Italian part being much more recent immigrants to the United States. Some of my cousins are the palest, freckled redheads, while others are positively swarthy. The only issue I ever remember having with any of that is that my olive-skinned mother never gets sunburned, and she sometimes forgot to put sunscreen on my lily-white child-self until she saw me turning red. 

The idea of discriminating amongst your own family members due to skin tone seems as bizarre to me as favoring one kid for having green eyes. It's just fucking weird."
memes,fcoq83q,t1_fcoowgc,1577838658.0,"Exact same nerve endings in men's nipples. I've known men who could orgasm just from nipple stimulation. 

And the only reason I wouldn't walk around topless or post it online is because society has made it taboo enough that, even if I were perfectly comfortable doing so, I'd get an enormous amount of unwanted attention - mostly of a sexual nature. I know this because of the amount of unwanted attention I got just trying to feed my children when they were babies. 

I walk around barefoot or showing my thighs or midriff, even though some people might be aroused by that, because we as a society have decided I'm allowed to do so without being harassed. Mostly."
