puppy101,ff9uail,t3_esfp8g,1579721484.0,"Sophia Yin has an extensive socialization list that I think is on the puppy wiki. 

Main advice is don't stop socialization after the ""socialization period"".  A lot of people think that it's the only time you can socialize them, but it's really just when they're most impressionable.  Mine is 11 months old now and barked at a pack of ""scary"" wild turkeys this weekend.  I still went through the whole stop and let him take it in, feed treats and reward for calm steps.  

You listed a lot of things he's still nervous or scared about, now is the best time to help him get used to it.  Socialization is about teaching your puppy that the new/scary thing they're seeing isn't scary at all.  E.g. I remember mine was scared of vacuums when he was a pup, but loved food.  I just kept placing treats on the vacuum for him to come over to it and get comfortable.  Then I'd turn it on once he was comfortable with the vacuum off and treat etc... Now I can't get him to move off the carpet when I'm vacuuming because he could care less."
puppy101,ff9ta4h,t3_esg4g2,1579720783.0,"For the marking, get your parents to clean each accident their puppy has with enzyme cleaner and thoroughly.  Since it's only at your parents, give him a belly band when you go so the pee doesn't get anywhere.  Mine will also mark at the pet store if another dog has peed there before, it's very hard for an intact male not to do so and more something to control their environment with.

I would wait for up to 2 years before neutering with goldens, especially since yours has a limp and it could be due to joint issues.  You don't want to exacerbate it in any way if you can help it."

Their energy also increases exponentially at this time, so exercise even if the exercise when they were younger was enough back then, more helps now. 

You can try some calming chews, adaptil diffusers and crating."

A lot of keeshond owners have three, something about them being like potato chips... I almost went crazy raising this puppy, so I'm good with one. 

The one nice thing to consider about having a lower energy dog breed though is they're just as happy to just spend the evening sitting next to you and getting pets as going for a hike or doing something really active.  I appreciate it on workdays, because I have to bring work home with me all the time and mine is happy to lounge around all evening and just be with you, no training, no playtime, little attention needed, after his evening walk. 

Definitely figure out what you want to prioritize OP, agility, work dog balance, personality etc... then get your pup :) Good luck finding the perfect match!"

They have the spitz stubborn streak and will give you the side eye and sigh if they don't want to do something, but they're probably one of the more biddable spitz breeds around since all you need to do is hold up a treat.  

I'm not sure about the high drive across the breed, but I keep being told mine is.  They're really smart  and they like to be worked and to be challenged.  Essentially they're happiest when they're spending time with you (and being fed lol)."

dogs,ff6v6ob,t3_erz0py,1579635548.0,"I have a keeshond.  He sounds exactly like what you're describing.  True medium sized dog, is pretty apathetic about strangers but loves dogs.  Most of them are really people friendly though, mine just doesn't care if they don't have a treat in their hand. I'm working up to agility with mine (11 months).  We've done some try outs though and he looks pretty promising or at least the trainers think so. They're also velcro dogs and like to keep their person in sight, so after some adolescent deafness, mine has had a pretty easy to train recall.  Basically no prey drive, never seen him pull towards any squirrel.

They are prone to nuisance barking and separation anxiety though.  You need to work on it hard and early.  I work full time and mine is fine crated at home, but a lot of other keesies I've heard have had major SA.  They'll be barkers no matter what, but you can reduce it significantly and I think most of them mainly alert bark. Mine barks when excited/over stimulated and to alert when something is off (e.g. homeless man in a garbage bag coat).  He almost never barks at home, even with lots of noise and things outside, only barks if someone comes into the house and he's allowed to greet them and I'm working on training that out now.

Check them out.  They're a pretty good breed for agility and really trainable.  I think if you're willing to tackle the barking and crate train they make good dogs.  They're nightmares as puppies though, mine barked at everything that breathed until about 6 months, but now that  he's mellowing out I can see the sweet adult dog that he'll become.

If you're looking into competitive agility though, BCs and aussies are really the best dogs for that.  There's a lot of competitive kees.  I know the breeder of the kees that placed 4th at westminster last year, but they're not fast enough I think to be truly competitive."

Dogtraining,ff5cdq7,t3_ermzwi,1579587128.0,"For every breed, I think you can find a breeder that's capable of breeding dogs that are sound in body and mind.  The neuroticism you're talking about can definitely be genetic e.g. sight hounds can develop light OCD, but a lot of it is developed because a dog is not stimulated enough and offered the enrichment and jobs it needs for its breed so it finds something else to do.  I'd look for a breed with the energy level that matches yours and if you're looking into intelligent dogs, make sure you have the time to train continuously.  That will help you avoid bad behavior and neuroticism more than anything else.  

I have a keeshond.  I'd say they're about as intelligent as an australian shepherd but don't have any prey drive.  The breed in general is really food motivated so they're easy to train and pick up tricks and commands fast.  They were bred to be alarm dogs and are all barkers though.  Most kees bark for a reason, to let their owner that there's something out of place, even if you disagree.  Of the kees I've seen with a barking problem where they bark for just the sake of barking or bark excessively, it is mainly due to poor training and inadequate corrections when young potentially compounded by being puppy mill dogs."

From another post of yours.

Please PLEASE make a plan for your puppy should something happen to your mother and or you.  Who is going to take care of the dog if your condition worsens or your mother's deteriorates.

No one is saying only the fittest people should have pets.  Almost everyone here works full time and figures out ways to take care of their pups while doing so.  Essentially no one has a perfect set up for their puppy, but what most people have is a stable household and the ability to care for the puppy daily.  You are in a situation where you are unable to care for yourself and have serious life threatening health issues. Your mom is also not going to be capable of caring for the puppy 100% of the time.  What happens if she has a manic episode and you're in the hospital?  Who cares for the dog then?

If you don't want to rehome her,  I'd look into co-ownership where someone you know and trust takes care of the dog part of the week or part of the day and you take care of her for the rest.  In the case where your health gets drastically worse, you have someone to help with the dog and take care of it full time.  The puppy will also get more chances to socialize, exercise and focus on training with said co-owner."

reactivedogs,fennr18,t1_fenloz3,1579288365.0,"Here's a good article that explains part of why she doesn't listen outside [https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/training/dog-training-duration-distance-distraction/](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/training/dog-training-duration-distance-distraction/)

Outside >>>> inside distraction wise.  If inside is a lvl 1 on distraction, going outside is like lvl 100.  If you're playing a video game you don't defeat a lvl 1 monster then KO a lvl 100 demon as your next foe, you head out and find something that's lvl 2.  Similarly, you ask for a sit at home with no distractions lvl 1. Once she does it 100%, you ask for a sit inside with maybe a bell ringing and wait for her to do it 100% lvl 2.  Go from really simple distractions to really hard ones slowly.

It also doesn't mean never take her outside, it just means don't get upset when she doesn't listen because she's highly distracted and overstimulated. Mine pulls like nothing else when we walk in a new neighborhood and I have to him on an easy walk harness so he doesn't choke himself, but he does a nice loose leash in my neighborhood and will even do a deliberate heel for treats.  I go through the no pull exercises with him when somewhere new, but I also don't get upset about it because I know he's overexcited with all the new scents."
reactivedogs,fenjrm2,t3_eq4517,1579286195.0,"If you haven't yet, put the daycare money into a private trainer and work with them on what's causing her short impulse control and high distractibility.  She's at an age where she is almost mature so the behavior is beyond normal adolescence brain but I suspect more she hasn't been taught how to settle and focus.  It takes time and practice and is very common for dogs to lose all their training when introduced to a high distraction situation aka anything new.

Don't get into the mindset that she doesn't respond to training. Consistent SHORT daily training sessions are really the key and it takes a LONG time.  I spent three months in training classes with my puppy where all he wanted to do was bark and bark at every little thing.  I felt so defeated, didn't think he'd ever stop, and the trainer even suggested to me that he'd never quiet down.  8 months later, he's got a CGC and can focus on me for the entire class.  I can tell he still really really wants to bark in class sometimes, but has developed enough self control to almost never do it.  I think I'll always have to manage his desire to hyper focus on a dog and bark at them, but I can definitively see the training paying off in his ability to control himself and choose me over the distraction. 

Since she's not a puppy and reactive to other dogs, I'd suggest starting off with a private trainer in a low distraction area like your home, who can walk you through how to train higher focus on you and how to handle distractions and slowly teach her how to choose attention on you over the distraction.  It's a different set of training skills from sit, stay, down but much more important to develop.

Hang in there and put in the training!"

Long-term, I would like to get to a point where I am comfortable taking him along to a brewery and can trust he will lay calmly by our seat without losing it on the other dogs at their own tables.

Real truth, reactivity isn't a quick fix that just goes away with training, most reactive dogs have to have their reactivity managed for their entire life and it's a long slow process to manage and control it.  He probably will never be able to go to a brewery or not react in some way to another dog and you should first ask yourself if you'd be ok with that for the rest of his life.  

If he is dog aggressive, you should first start with muzzle training him to avoid him causing serious harm should an off leash dog approach him and he can't get away.  To help with the fence fighting and window barking, cover your windows with window frost so he can't see out of it and establish some kind of system with your neighbor so only one of your dogs is out at one time.  There's a lot of resources for leash reactivity on the wiki in this subreddit. The book Feisty Fido is a good starting point for training exercises.

4. Use high value treats that he only gets during training class.  I use string cheese and doggy meat rolls.
5. If he gets easily distracted get him to do tricks while the instructor talks or another dog does the exercise.

puppy101,fdue5l2,t3_en0zsa,1578731737.0,"Socialization is a life long process and something, along with training, that should be worked on daily. Adolescence is one of the worst times to stop socialization. 

A mistake a lot of small dog owners, especially chihuahua owners will make is to excuse aggression and inappropriate behavior as a breed trait.  Pitbulls are genetically prone to dog aggression, but we don't excuse it and still expect them to behave appropriately with dogs and humans and attain proper training.   Just because your dog's breed is small and prone to anxiety/ fear, doesn't excuse her from lashing out and you should not allow the bad behavior to continue.  

There's a chihuahua a few houses down from us that barks constantly when it sees another dog.  It hates other dogs, despises them and will try to bite them if any come near it.  I ended up having to put in a noise complaint because the owner would leave the dog on her balcony in a crate all day. It'd see a person or another dog walk past it and just bark and bark for 15 minutes straight.  Rinse and repeat 50x a day and you can see how insane the poor dog was. In the 6 months that this neighbor has lived here, I've seen her walk her dog 3 or 4 times (maybe they walk her on off times though), and met the dog once where it bared its teeth at mine, growled and barked its head off.  The owner also excused the dog's behavior by saying she's a chihuahua.  You don't want that kind of dog.  There's another chi that I see the owner walk every morning and evening.  She's super well socialized, super sweet and playful with small dogs and a little nervous with bigger dogs.  She'll let them sniff as long as the dog is calm and check them out though.  That chihuahua small dog tendency to be nervous of larger dogs is still there and maybe this one is just naturally more friendly, but you can tell the owner's put in a lot of work to make sure the dog is good with other dogs.  

If your pup is acting out with other dogs the first thing to do is determine what the source of the lashing out is coming from.  If it's from fear, work with a trainer to help her slowly overcome it without simply throwing her into a dog park and calling it socialization.   If she's just prone to aggression, work with a trainer and vet to figure out how to best address it.  Increase the training you're doing with her at the moment and yes keep up the socialization.  Socialization doesn't mean drop her in a dog park and let her continue to growl.  It means let her have safe and positive experiences with dogs.  Training daily should involve correcting if she growls and recalling her back to you if she looks like she's going to lash out. Any behavior issue you see during adolescence shouldn't be waited out, because it's likely going to get worse if left unattended and not corrected, not better once the dog fully matures."
puppy101,fdsaoqj,t3_emyj54,1578698248.0,"The first thing I'd do is post a notice on your door that you just got a puppy, write that he's still getting used to his environment and adjusting, say that you're working on training and politely request people have patience for the next few months.  Find the neighbor that complained.  Give them a bottle of wine and some airplugs, apologize and ask that they let you know if he's barking so you can better train him and to have some patience as you're training him.  People tend to be more patient if they know you're actively doing something about the problem. 

There's a lot of advice on training separation anxiety in this subreddit already, search it up and look through the wiki.  

One last thing to do, is think about getting pet insurance for your dog.  If you can, ask the gifter where they got the puppy from and if they have any background on the dog's parents' health.  If they don't have any or they got the pup from craigslist/online it's likely the puppy will develop health issues in the future in which case the insurance will pay off in the long run."

3. No health issues in the parents
4. If you wanna be super thorough, check that the lineage of the parents are also free from noticeable patterns of health issues or young deaths
5. Reputable breeders also guarantee health for breed specific issues for X years as well. Make sure they don't force you to feed the dog a specific brand of food in order to give you the health guarantee.

Don't assume that because he's a mix he'll have hybrid vigor. That's a myth.  Just make sure the parents are both healthy and the breeder did their research and proper screening before breeding. I especially emphasize this for designer puppies, because a lot of them come from shady breeders.

Diet certainly can have an effect on your dog's behavior.  Take for instance, how do you feel after eating a fast food meal vs a healthy balanced home cooked meal?  However, feeding raw can easily give your dog an unbalanced diet that may hurt his behavior and health rather than help. 

Food is not going to resolve all of your behavior problems either.  If your dog is reactive because it's reacting out of fear, then a different food source is not going to get rid of that fear.   

I'd say a diet change can impact your dog's behavior, but you should look into diet changes for improving health and not for improving behavior. You should look at your own individual dog and discuss with a behaviorist or trainer and see what's the source of his reactivity or other behavioral issues and work on a training plan to improve it."

Have you been taking him to training classes to teach the foundational skills needed? Training classes help teach the dog more impulse control and of course new and appropriate behaviors.  If you want a social life, factor the dog into it and find activities that you can do with the friend + dog.  I do a lot of beach trips with friends and bring the dog along or hiking trips and drag the dog along.  I get a tired dog, lots of socialization and still get to catch up with friends. It's more fun to do these trips with a dog than just a couple of people too.  

I also recently graduated, and am raising a puppy by myself.  He's not a working line GSD though, has no prey drive and is a medium energy dog.  He still needs about two hours of exercise at 11 months old and daily training and work to keep him from going crazy and misbehaving.  It's not easy for anyone, so if that's any assurance, everyone raising a pup is going through it.  It's just going to last longer and be even more work for you given the breed.  

To be frank, I think the breed is a bad fit for you, it's a bad fit for 99% of people, especially since you didn't go into it expecting the amount of exercise needed and with a plan to enroll him into some kind of sport/job.  Even if you're an active person and looking for a dog to go on hikes or run with, you don't need that much energy.  If you do end up rehoming him, consider looking into a GSD rescue."
