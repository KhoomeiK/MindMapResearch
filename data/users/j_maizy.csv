Sorry to hear that you have to put your boy down, you obviously care about him and I‚Äôm sure you gave him an amazing life."
dogs,fd9izcf,t3_ekd1uc,1578234084.0,"My dog‚Äôs current set up when we are actively training or out and about:
Collar: EzyDog Double Up Collar
Leash: EzyDog Zero Shock Leash (bungee) or Mendota Snap Leash
Harness: RuffWear Front Range Harness (front and back clip options) or RuffWear Web Master (the harness part of his backpack
Backpack: RuffWear Pallisades Pack (for backpacking, can be used to accommodate multiple days worth of things)

I believe RuffWear and EzyDog ship internationally as they are larger companies though still reliable and sturdy. Their products are made for those that need durable gear for their pups. Also, because much of their stuff is used by people that hike, camp, backpack, etc. with their dog, many of their items have reflective aspects which is nice. 

My favorite Etsy store (that I believe ships internationally) is Monica Ann Pets. I‚Äôve ordered multiple leashes and collar from her and they‚Äôve all been great they just don‚Äôt have the same reflective aspects as RuffWear or EzyDog."

dogs,fd93uo5,t1_fd92a46,1578228003.0,"From personal experience, I‚Äôve seen a lot of gentle giants across many different breeds including GSDs. If you do your due diligence on choosing a breeder and then follow up with training and socialization of your own, I don‚Äôt see any reason as to why you can‚Äôt have the GSD you want‚ù§Ô∏è. I wish you the best in this adventure!"
Pets,fd932lo,t3_ekbv1u,1578227667.0,"A couple good options to consider would be to adopt an older, mellower dog that does not require as much socialization as well as skipping the puppy stage (potty training, teething stage, and socialization classes/puppy socials) and/or fostering. Keep in mind many adult rescue dogs still need training and some even potty training depending on their history but a situation like a rehome where the dog was previously well cared for and the dog was eventually surrender for reasons out of his/her control (is death of the owner) could be a good option. Many rescues offer a foster to adopt option or foster with first right if adoption that could help you ensure you are adding the right dog to your household. This could allow you and your boyfriend to adopt a dog only when you both feel ready and comfortable rather than only one of you feeling sure. 

Puppies are absolutely a lot of time so that is a reasonable concern and should be evaluated in its entirety before you bring a puppy home. As an owner the goal is to set your dog up for success but that only if you are willing to invest a lot of time, money and energy. I am not by any means trying to deter you from getting a puppy or dog but rather just evaluate your own life and circumstances and not just wants."
dogs,fd911fb,t3_ekc0ur,1578226600.0,"Hi there -

I want to start with disclosing that I have a Shiloh Shepherd and not a GSD but I am passionate about well trained, well socialized dogs regardless of breed which is why I am replying to this. I strongly believe that like any breed, German Shepherds can be amazing dogs with the right owners/handlers. 

While, yes, socialization and training (especially during that key period from 8 to 16 weeks) is extremely important, genetics are important too especially for a breed such as GSDs. If going with a breeder, make sure you go with one that health tests the parents extensively (ie OFA and/or PennHip evaluations on the parents‚Äô hips and OFA for elbows as well) as well as sell their puppies with health guarantees as a standard part of the sales contract. Find a breeder that really wants to know about you and your life style so they can pair the right puppy with you. My favorite breeders, and the ones I think are most reputable, are the ones that do not place puppies off of deposit order nor do they allow owners to pick out their own dogs but rather they have a third party perform a temperament test (such as a Volhard test) on the litter and place puppies according or at least with assistance of that. Titles on both parents can be a very good sign - things such as the Canine Good Citizen (CGC) are relatively easy tests  for friendly, trained dogs to achieve. Especially if you do not meet both parents in person, titles from dog sports can be a good indicator of training and stability of the parents. 

If you are very concerned about your competency when it comes to adequately training and socializing (not a personal attack but things such as time, money, and energy can cause restrictions of that) a puppy then consider an adult dog. Many rescues offer foster to adopt situations where you can make sure the dog is a right fit for you and vise versa before you fully commit to adding him/her into your family. Like what I said about breeders, go with a rescue that places the dog off of their temperament and the belief that the dog with fit in with your lifestyle. Adult dogs in particular can be a great option as they are trainable but at that point in regards to socialization, you pretty much have what you have. Many breeders place their retired adult breeding dogs into loving homes so that is a good option that provides a balance between a dog in need of a home and good genetics (and hopefully training and socialization as well). 

I support responsible rescues and I support responsible breeders so I‚Äôm not trying to push you one way or another. I just want to be able to pass along some things to consider when making that decision. When owning a large breed such as a GSD, you have to remember that any altercations with smaller dogs will sometimes/oftentimes be blamed on the larger dog regardless of the actual reason it started. It is a shame that there‚Äôs that double standard but it has made me a more responsible owner having a giant breed - mine is always on leash unless I am confident his recall is 100%, I don‚Äôt allow leash on leash meetings which is thankfully very standard practice now, I always have all of his tags (identification and rabies) on him, etc. 

I feel like I see that double standard applied to kids frequently as owners will allow their babies or toddlers to mess around with the dog without paying attention to the dog‚Äôs signals (stress, discomfort, etc) and the dog might nip or give a warning growl. While it‚Äôs just the dog communicating their discomfort, obviously the goal is to have everyone safe and happy both humans and dog so it is on you the owner to ensure that and set your dog up for success. Don‚Äôt let your baby pull on ears or tails or crawl on the dog, don‚Äôt let them throw toys at the dog, etc. If the child isn‚Äôt old enough to understand that and follow direction, then he/she should never be left alone with the dog if it can‚Äôt reliably interact with the dog in an appropriate manner. 

I hope at least some of that is helpful! I tried not to share personal stories a) because you asked about GSDs and I own a Shiloh and b) when you ask the internet, you‚Äôll always hear both good and bad experiences so I wanted to give you important information of things to consider to help you decide what‚Äôs best for you. If you get a new pup, make sure to post a picture please!"

FromPuppyToDog,fcww45u,t1_fcwjzq3,1578040097.0,One of my favorite TV characters is Auggie from Covert Affairs so that inspired his name but I also just that it was not overly common and cute at the same time. His collar color from when he was born to when I picked up was red so I decided his registered name would be Augustus Red of River Pack.

FromPuppyToDog,fcupz1a,t1_fcul807,1577986161.0,"Auggie‚Äôs actually a Shiloh Shepherd but the breed did originate from GSDs. Auggie is super, super mellow and will happily nap all day. He was an easy puppy but I also put a ton of time, money, and effort into puppy socials and training ever since bringing him home to ensure he was well socialized, confident, and stable as an adult dog. For reference he currently weighs 105lbs and is on the small side for Shilohs (one of his brothers is 130lbs) and was 20.5lbs at pickup at 8 weeks old."

shilohshepherds,fctz7tq,t3_ckglfj,1577966760.0,"Look up if there is a convenient International All Breed Canine Association (IABCA) show near you. You can look at the roster to see if there are any Shilohs attending. There are some Facebook groups online that can be a good resource for finding breeders but make sure to read the group rules before posting in there. Many post similar ISO ads in those groups so utilizing the search bar can make it easier for you in regards to advice that‚Äôs already been given. 

Realistically, most people will tell you this: 
The majority of reputable breeders have a waitlist that can often be a year or two wait. Good breeders place their puppies based off of temperament over color or gender preference which is why the Litter Evaluation Report (LER) is used to evaluate the natural characteristics of the puppy - play drive, prey drive, gun shyness, forgiveness, etc. - to determine which puppies would be suitable for which families/life styles. Legitimate Shiloh breeders use LERs at 8 weeks of age to place puppies, fully health and temperament test the parents, and send their puppies home with health guarantees as well as their ongoing support for the length of the dog‚Äôs life and oftentimes even longer. 

Because breeders can have such a long waitlist, start reaching out to breeders you think might be a good fit for you. Build a relationship with the breeder and learn more about their breeding program as they learn about you and the type of dog you need. Only get a puppy from a breeder you feel confident in working with - ask for references of their vet, past or current puppy owners, and google them/their kennel. The breeder should do their due diligence and shouldn‚Äôt be offended by you doing yours. 

As for location and travel - traveling for the right dog is worth it. Many breeders are willing ship their dog to you or give you the option to drive and pick your puppy up. From my dog‚Äôs litter, I flew from CO to VA to pick up, my breeder flew with one puppy from VA to FL, shipped a puppy CA to CA, and one person drove from Canada to VA while two stayed in state. If shipping/having the dog flown to you, you can look up puppy flight nannies that accompany your puppy during the trip to you if you‚Äôre uncomfortable with the puppy being unattended. Many Shilohs are too large to fly in cabin at 8 weeks of age, weight can easily be abound 20lbs at that point. 
Hope this helps!"
