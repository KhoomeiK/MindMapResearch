It was not just Facebook memes, the second paragraph talks about them hacking DNC and releasing the information. The second one! There's so much more shit in there. 

I didn't get that from some fucking news network, I got that from reading the actual report. That's the thing with people like you. You stay in your echo chambers and refuse to actually LOOK at any of the evidence. Its there, its all fucking there! If you deny it at this point you are either admitting you have your head in the sand or you are making the absurd claim that the Mueller Report, our entire intelligence community, and nearly all of our allies around the world are wrong or lying about interference. Five people have gone to prison because of that big ol nothing sandwich you say the report is. The only ""nothing burger"" here is the BS uninformed assholes like you spin up.

You say they failed to prove it had any effect on the outcome, but you know whats complete bullshit about that? You say that like that was the intended goal of the report, when that's not a metric they were looking at. These are the facts the report found are: 

* Russians interfered with the election to the benefit of Donald J. Trump. It lists the numerous ways it did so, but does not speculate as to how many voters each action may have swayed because that was not the intent of the report. 

* While numerous people around Trump were coordinating with Russia, they could not find sufficient evidence that Trump himself did. However, they acknowledge that several members of the White House did things that would normally be considered interference with an investigation. Some have been prosecuted for this, such as Roger Stone.

* They were unable to charge the President with obstruction of justice is because the Department of Justice under Atorney General Barr have taken the stance that a sitting president can not be charged with a crime.


Read the report and tell me again with a straight face that all Russian interference was about was Facebook memes."

Ex-CIA/Delta Force/Green Beret soldier John ""Johnny"" Johnson just wants to enjoy his retirement at 45+ with his wife and kid/dog at their upper middle class home on the East Coast. Suddenly one day, he gets a visit from an old partner/handler/friend that says ""we need you back Johnny"". John refuses, but later that day his home gets attacked by communists/terrorists/corrupt government agents. Despite being out of his prime, he kills all of them and sends his family away to safety. Where exactly? It doesn't matter, they're safe now, and we won't be hearing from them again until maybe the end of the book. 

John comes out of retirement and uses all his old tricks to track down and take out the communists/terrorists/corrupt government agents for wrecking his house. Surprise! His old partner/handler/friend was in on it and now John has to take him out too!
