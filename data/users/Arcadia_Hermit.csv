dogs,ffduepl,t1_ffczit4,1579829179.0,I’ll try and get a good one to post tomorrow!!
dogs,ffc4pjq,t1_ffc33lx,1579791466.0,Thursdays are rough at work and this makes it so. much. better. 😂
dogs,ffc2nij,t3_estlgm,1579790014.0,"I saw a video on Instagram of a someone doing “dog burpees” and had to try it with Lena. She already has all three moves on cue - sit, lay down, and leap (which is just doing a little jump), so she caught onto the sequence quickly and it is super cute. 

Aside from that, we’ve had a pretty slow week, but the weather is expected to be unseasonably nice this weekend. Can’t wait to take advantage with a nice long hike!"
dogs,ffc208c,t1_ffc19g4,1579789536.0,Brilliant 😂
dogs,ff9a3fg,t1_ff94wbu,1579708298.0,"Something must be in the air! Lena had nasty stomach issues several days last week and now my SO’s dog has started up with them. If I didn’t work from home with the ability to take them out every few hours, we’d probably just have to condemn our house and start over 😂 

Glad Gin is on the mend, though!!"
k9sports,ff95c7r,t3_escaj4,1579705210.0,"I’m debating on whether I want to do TEAM level 1 at silver or pick up both that and the Toys class at bronze. We’re already doing in person nosework and tricks classes for February, so I don’t want to blow my doggie budget completely out of the water lol."
dogs,ff66x1c,t1_ff62ty0,1579620579.0,I love how she makes sure those soft toys are good and dead before she puts them away 😆
dogs,ff5uh4c,t1_ff5kqy5,1579610669.0,"I paddle board with my 50lb dog. She is obsessed with water, so I always spend about 10-15 playing fetch and letting her swim so she gets it out of her system before we hop on the board. I agree 100% with u/saurapid about practicing mat work and transferring those skills to laying calmly on the board/ kayak. I also would recommend practicing getting him in and out/ on and off in shallow water, just to prepare in the event he does hop out while y’all are in deeper water."
BalancedTraining,ff5rkv4,t1_ff5dmt4,1579607495.0,"Thank you so much for the super thorough reply! Of the ones listed we’ve only been to twin lakes near Avery, so this is going to really expand our options. I agree 100%  with preferring these type of parks and my dog really does too. She’s pretty “meh” on playing with other dogs and prefers to sprint back and forth to me and sniff. She’s just not quite where I want to be yet for off leash hiking without any form of redundancy (although we’re getting there!) so I appreciate having these options."
BalancedTraining,ff56z4i,t1_ff0o7l9,1579582026.0,"Off topic, but would you mind sharing where in CO you found these parks? That sounds awesome for working on recall."
dogs,ff3xlhi,t1_ff3fm2f,1579551066.0,"Hahaha exactly. My big concern is whether she’s going to clothesline me trying to get to the poop, not the consumption."
dogs,ff3cxo2,t3_erdo6e,1579538646.0,"I went on a run with Lena yesterday and SO tagged along. The trail I prefer for 3+ mile runs (because, flat lol) cuts through pastureland for cows. We’ve been PREMACK-ing our way through that minefield, and Lena has improved so much. SO was horrified when, after a 5 or so perfect leave-its, I let her sniff and get a tiiiiny taste of one patty 🤷🏼‍♀️ I figure herbivore poop isn’t so bad, right? Right? 😂"
dogs,ff3c2ap,t1_ff3b4uf,1579538204.0,"Oh my god, how horrifying and heartbreaking. I hope you are doing something nice for yourself this week, I can’t imagine having to deal with that 💜"
dogs,fesh3b0,t3_eqgsqb,1579365017.0,"Came back from my work trip to poor Lena having a pretty gnarly bout of diarrhea :( She got probiotic and Pepcid AC (thank god my sister is a vet tech), but it still lasted over 48 hours, and I was all set to take her in this morning. Luckily, she finally seems to be on the upswing though 🙌 We might take it easy today and then try and get in a longer hike tomorrow. She also has her first Intro to Odor class for nosework on Monday, which I’m super psyched for!"
namenerds,feoskyi,t1_feoqr13,1579304820.0,Someone was a One Tree Hill fan 😂
dogs,feevlfv,t1_fee34v9,1579042162.0,"I think Lena and Tesla might be long lost sisters. This describes her to a T. I haven’t introduced the e-collar yet (still fully working through the 3 Ds), but it is definitely a possibility in the future for the exact reasons you stated. Our big challenge is living in a wildlife heavy area, there is only so much distraction proofing you can do. She has been an absolute angel on the 20 foot long line for months, and I was even toying with the idea of trying an off leash hike when we encountered a novel creature (turkeys) and you bet she blew right through my recall and hit the end of the line like freight train 🤦🏼‍♀️ I’ve lived in the area and hiked this trail for nearly three years and this was the first turkey sighting- so how am I gonna proof that?"
dogs,feavgri,t1_fe9ochr,1578952574.0,"Thirding 🙋🏼‍♀️ Especially since I spend a ton of money and time on classes for a dog that will in all likelihood never trial. But she loves to learn and she LOVES nosework, and I love to do activities with her, so we go! 

I also hesitate to enter the animal-centric competitive world after years of horseback riding. Although super intense dog people are FAR better than super intense horse people, in my experience lol."
dogs,fe3g1ra,t3_ennwwt,1578848953.0,"Currently sitting at the airport - I’ll be gone through Thursday for work travel 😩 Lena is in good hands with my SO (he already took her for a long fetch session at the park this morning and sent me tons of photos), but I definitely have some separation anxiety lol."
k9sports,fdqdtam,t3_emjxfi,1578664034.0,"Socialpronk gave excellent advice. Since Baron is only a year old and a large breed mix, I’d also recommend sticking to dirt trails if possible and building up his fitness/ your distance slowly to protect his joints."
dogs,fdon9br,t1_fdnyq20,1578608613.0,I wouldn’t have any skin left on my hands if I washed them every time I pet my dog lol. Also she sleeps in my bed so 🤷🏼‍♀️
dogs,fdj7vxh,t1_fdhefvw,1578460957.0,Great suggestions! Thanks so much for the feedback. I’m going to try and take a video to post for the next Training Tuesday.
dogs,fdiz3ol,t1_fdicr95,1578454371.0,"You sound like a great owner :) I agree this is probably marking - my female dog does it as well. We were recently away from home for two weeks for the holidays, and our first walk when we got back it seemed like she was basically squatting every few feet lol."
dogs,fdh1wmy,t1_fdh099b,1578413595.0,"Yes! So I’m using an overturned storage container as a platform currently (working with what I got haha). My goal is eventually fade to just the lid of that container, and from there practice rounds with the lid, then a couple rounds without, then adding it back. And slowly fade the prop that way. Does that seem like an okay method in your experience?"
dogs,fdgxqdf,t3_elc0og,1578410908.0,"I finally busted out a platform for working on “return” (my cue for a more formal heel position) and fronts. She knows the positioning but is sloppy af lol. Which is definitely on me for starting the positions sans platform, but ya live and ya learn 🤷🏼‍♀️"
dogs,fdgxgo9,t1_fdgrvl2,1578410722.0,So thrilled to hear the good news! And glad you’re already seeing an improvement!
dogs,fdgxe0a,t1_fdgshod,1578410671.0,Such a smart boy! And he has already grown SO much from the first videos!
dogs,fdb8w6y,t1_fdb6h4g,1578255027.0,Can confirm. I worked in a grocery store for several years in high school and have seen all the above and more.
dogs,fd56cos,t1_fd50lud,1578174626.0,"Oof that’s what I’m concerned about as well. I check her gums each time and they seem fine, but it’s so abrasive I feel like it can’t be good for them. However, she isn’t as stoked on the softer tugs we have 🤦🏼‍♀️"
dogs,fd3y0ll,t3_ejx1g0,1578162612.0,"I recently got Lena the Chuck-it ball that is attached to a nylon loop. She LOVES it, both for fetch and tug. However, she prefers to hold the nylon loop part for tug instead of the ball 🙄
Could this possibly cause issues with her teeth? It doesn’t seem to be painful or anything, and I don’t yank (of course), but she does tug hard enough that I work up a sweat playing with her lol."
dogs,fd2vyzz,t1_fd2kkyh,1578152181.0,"Yes, please!"
dogs,fd2asx6,t3_ejp27m,1578144433.0,"How cool! Thanks so much for sharing. We’re close enough to Fort Collins, but my dog is too young  :( I’ll share among my friends though, I think at least a couple have dogs who would qualify!"
dogs,fcxjh8o,t1_fcxiiwm,1578064451.0,"Hmmm that’s a good question. I’d assume it’s owned by the complex - there is a sign saying that it’s for use only by residents, but of course there is no way to enforce that without a lock and code like you mentioned. We have those lock codes for the complex gym and pool, but not the dog park 🤷🏼‍♀️

I seriously think this couple lives in the park lol. I see them at high traffic times and also at like 10am and 2pm, which is when I try to go. I work from home, so got spoiled almost always having it to ourselves at off-times."
dogs,fcxhnjt,t3_ejfvso,1578063164.0,"Discovered yesterday that a couple with a young black lab who are CONSTANTLY in the apartment/townhouse dog park don’t even live here 😒 I saw them walking out of their house across the street. 

I always leash Lena up and head out whenever anyone else wants to come in (since she can be an asshole to other dogs), but it’s frustrating that even at the off times when we usually have it to ourselves, they are almost always there or show up soon after. Especially considering I pay exorbitant pet rent that covers maintenance/use of this park. 

I think next time they show up when we’re already there, I’ll just ask for 15-20 more minutes and see what happens."
running,fcvunip,t1_fcvss6v,1578010489.0,"Definitely agree. I see tons of comments recommending firearms, knives. But you’re not going to have time to draw a weapon when a cat drops onto your back out of a tree...

ETA: and mountain lions are also patient predators. If it’s stalking you, it’s noting your habits. I would avoid running that loop for quite a while, if ever again, personally."
dogs,fcvcf7v,t1_fcui69i,1577999173.0,The one of him in his crate and the rest of your dogs on their beds seriously melted my heart 😍
dogs,fcuj00j,t1_fcufuaz,1577982087.0,"Beautiful photos!! This is the prime time of the year for desert hiking, glad you are enjoying it so far 😊"
dogs,fcqyd15,t3_eiipem,1577894060.0,"Happy New Year!! We’re on the second leg of our journey home. Shout out to the Loves truck stop in New Baden, Illinois for having a (fairly well-maintained!) dog park. We had it all to ourselves, and Lena appreciated the chance to stretch her legs off leash."
dogs,fc9n3xq,t3_egr4ld,1577555171.0,"Lena has been having an absolute blast at my parents’ place over the last week. They have about 12 acres, and she’s sprinted like a maniac over every one. We’ve spent some time working on her off leash recall, and I’ve been impressed with how well she’s done (novel wildlife not withstanding 🙄).

I’ve also gotten a kick out of seeing how she responds when my family gives her cues. I only tell them about the “fun” ones like spin, shake, so on, that I don’t mind getting a little poisoned or having to do some remedial work on. I use both a verbal and hand gesture, and it’s fun to see the ones she really has down on the verbal, with essentially a stranger giving it to her (and the ones where she stares at them like they’re speaking a foreign language lol)."
dogs,fc96nuq,t1_fc91auq,1577547876.0,"I haven’t spent much time in Phoenix, but Tucson is a pretty easy day trip away and has some awesome and dog-friendly hiking options. Particularly around Mount Lemmon!"
dogs,fbxvael,t3_ef1soy,1577201440.0,"My sister, who is a vet tech and also a saint, clipped Lena’s nails last night. So now we have a nice short baseline to continue our work with DS the dremel. I also need to get more comfortable with clippers because she handled it incredibly well, and I may need to reconsider my primary nail care tool."
