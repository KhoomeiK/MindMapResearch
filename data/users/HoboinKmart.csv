This is not fake news gaselighting, this is stating a fact. My father fought in desert storm and has beared witness to this. This is all I have to say"

trump,fdbbib3,t1_fdaiw3o,1578255754.0,"Provide sources that are unbiased and not fake news for this “bombing of cultural sites” he just took out one of the top military commanders who has constructed acts such as 9/11 and multiple other terrorists incidents, and you defend the terrorists actions? And yet you ask why the democrats are terrorists. If you took them time to read, you would see it was sarcasm, but it’s turning out to be less sarcasm since you seem to back those in Iran who threaten our way of life. Read a book and understand that these so proclaimed “cultural sites” are actually places of bombs and weapons being built. Iranians used to claim buildings that were being blown up were hospitals and schools, when in fact they are weapon facilities or terrorist meetings."
trump,fdbabk1,t1_fd8m6xb,1578255447.0,"Did you just blow in from stupid town? If you took 2 seconds to read you would understand the argument is other countries weighing in on American politics. I don’t weigh in on Iran or British politics, it isn’t my business just like this clearly isn’t yours. Fucking twat"
Drugs,fdba2h8,t3_ejuj4w,1578255355.0,"This post shouldn’t be on this sub. It is a mere baseless assumption, and harasses drug users on a sub meant to tailor towards those of using substances. This is targeted harassment based on a weak assumption and overreaction from OP."
Drugs,fdb9nzw,t1_fd5zjbj,1578255203.0,"Can never be to careful? What does that even mean by making a claim you don’t even know to be true? That’s similar to if your bike got stolen and you immediately blame the blacks because they account for 50% of crime for the 13% minority they are. Just because it is more likely does not mean it is the causal truth. This is an assumption, and where are the sources stating people who use insulin are more responsible than drug users?"
4chan,fdb8z2u,t1_fd8md68,1578255051.0,"Did you not read and understand? You seem to have taken this quite literally. Understand the context which is that the U.S. government is one hypocrisy piss pile by deciding who keeps shag lands and extracting others out from theirs based on who has the bigger stick. Your government is fucking the Indians, and it’ll fuck you too."
4chan,fdb8imf,t3_ejwogr,1578254904.0,"This is immense sarcasm, the fact that you took it literally shows you didn’t take the time necessary to READ and UNDERSTAND the context."
aww,fdb80rc,t1_fcvt5n2,1578254802.0,Yes.
aww,fdb7vmc,t1_fcviwhy,1578254776.0,Because a link proves everything. This is common sense if you’ve ever owned a cat. They like to sleep in warm areas (especially kittens) have you ever seen a cat bask in a sunray? No? Ok ima need the link for it.
aww,fdb7jej,t1_fcvnefe,1578254656.0,"I love that OP agrees and got downvoted, props to your knowledge and I applaude you for being responsible."
