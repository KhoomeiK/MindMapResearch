I hope it's cold where you are so you can wear the heck out of it!"
neopets,fdpjlm1,t1_fdpjd2c,1578630398.0,"I get that! I also have to hype myself up to play GC since I just don't care for it and am just plain bad. 

I don't do Food Club for that reason. I don't gamble IRL. I am not sure if I am ready to find my digital self to be more inclined to gambling. 

Losing money, even if it's nps, makes me nervous."
neopets,fdphine,t1_fdo7szo,1578628778.0,"I am in the same boat! I turned 31 and started playing a few months back. I also am not very good at saving money or playing games. (To make money, I play Ghoul Catchers, which I don't like-like.)"

How long have you been doing graphic design? Are you self taught or did you go to school for it? How do you make time for personal work?"
sewing,fda5ci7,t1_fd92bix,1578241889.0,"Thanks! I don't have Facebook and wouldn't know about this otherwise. 

Is there a way to download the pattern or gather the information without creating a Facebook account? Sorry. It's a very scary website to me."
Illustration,fd9rsix,t3_ekcml1,1578237185.0,"It reminds me of the movie The Witch! 

Can you explain what you did digitally? I am still learning Adobe and I like the idea of being able to combine both traditional and digital art."

Sourdough,fcuzjap,t1_fcuyqz3,1577991628.0,"Your bread is beautiful. When I followed the recipe, my result was nowhere as nice. 

How did you shape such a high hydration loaf? That's my biggest issue."
