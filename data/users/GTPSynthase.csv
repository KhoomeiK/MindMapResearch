I would focus on doing the next right thing for yourself and try to make the best out of the bus while you can. Stay clean and try to stay positive. I know it's hard, but maybe something good will come out of this that you can't foresee."
gradadmissions,ferez8a,t1_felvgdj,1579353117.0,"Yes, I’m doing a lot better now. That is good to hear! I am wishing you the best of luck with everything, but I truly believe everything will work out! :)"
gradadmissions,fep7bwk,t3_eq62m7,1579313761.0,"I think you would be competitive enough to even go for a PhD straight out of undergrad, especially if your GPA has an upward progression. The masters would help, but I do think you currently have a decent chance at a good program."
gradadmissions,feltiv7,t3_epu8op,1579230562.0,"I received the same email from Baylor SOM twice too. My choice was for chemical/ physical/ structural bio, though. It's really frustrating. If you say you're going to send a decision soon, then follow up with it."
gradadmissions,felt7wl,t1_felsdms,1579230345.0,"Awesome, thank you!!"
gradadmissions,fels4j1,t3_epmq1u,1579229578.0,"I'm pretty sure I went to the same school as you (go cocks), and I had a similar story. I kept the personal story part very brief, and I only mentioned it in a positive light. ""Despite these struggles, I was still able to excel with a 3.4 major GPA due to my passion for political science..."" I also mentioned that these life experiences have allowed me to mature academically while teaching me patience and humility (I took a gap year away from school). Also, if you feel comfortable with one or two of your letter writers, maybe you could tell them your story. They would probably be able to speak about your abilities on your behalf, and how your grades at that time are not a reflection of future graduate performance. You never know what will happen unless you try to apply, but I do think you have a good chance of getting into the right school!!"
gradadmissions,felqk46,t3_epnhhm,1579228513.0,I would also like to know this- if anyone is out there for life sciences. :)
gradadmissions,felpxq5,t1_fel92u1,1579228081.0,Were they mostly acceptances or rejections? I want to prepare for the number of rejections that I will be getting..
Anxiety,feid934,t1_fegr61h,1579135797.0,"It is terrible. Thank you for the advice, I will try these. I like the random numbers instead of ordered counting."
Anxiety,feid5o3,t1_fehjipo,1579135735.0,Thank you so much! I will keep this in mind to try.
Anxiety,feggw01,t1_fegfhvd,1579092356.0,Thank you. I’m wishing us a good day!
Anxiety,fegetzp,t3_ep02tq,1579090323.0,"I struggle with this too. Whenever I start imagining these scenarios, I have to keep repeating to myself, ""I can't predict the future."" Over and over again. And that this is just my anxiety. It oddly helps calm me down. 

If I could predict the future, I would probably be in a much better place in life by now. :)"
AskAcademia,feff16a,t1_fefbf09,1579054943.0,"Were you on grants too, and it still never came up? I just applied to several schools that never asked about my background, and it made me wonder if they would ask in the future if they didn't ask now."
gradadmissions,fef9nrv,t3_eop0go,1579051459.0,"I applied too and never heard back. I saw those invites, though. I already assumed I was rejected by this point, lol. :( Wishing you the best of luck with the overall process!"
unpopularopinion,fef7iq0,t1_fec23e4,1579050022.0,That's why I don't agree with the statement stating that people should stop classifying drugs and alcohol as separate things.
gradadmissions,fe66rn7,t3_enx2ua,1578883055.0,"[https://www.petersons.com/](https://www.petersons.com/)

Then search for grad schools/ biochem programs and most of the acceptance rates will come up. Also, some of the programs will publish it on their school's website somewhere, but you have to search for it."
gradadmissions,fe65fyd,t1_fbx24fo,1578882202.0,"Hey, I received an interview for UCSD Thursday night! I'm hoping you have already heard/ will hear from them soon! :)"
unpopularopinion,fe64zxn,t3_enwijq,1578881914.0,"Yeah, alcohol is I guess a drug in that regard. However, then would cough syrup be a drug? It can be abused, but it is legal. Then, would Advil fall into this same class of drugs? It is also a ""drug,"" but you can't necessarily get ""high"" off of it. Now, is caffeine a part of this category too? Caffeine alters your mind enough to the point that you may consider it a high.   
If drugs and alcohol cannot be classified as separate things, where do you draw the line?"
Anxiety,fe55eu8,t3_ensw1h,1578865781.0,Feeling this right now

cats,fdy23pz,t1_fdxzh4l,1578775229.0,"The vet recently said he had higher levels of creatinine, so he is beginning to show stage 1 of kidney disease, unfortunately. He doesn't have any symptoms of the disease, though, and the vet said the symptoms could take years to show. I've been giving him wet food to keep him (hopefully) extra hydrated. They said it shouldn't be connected to the issue of going in my bed and it is more of a behavioral thing. Other than that, he seems healthy. 

Are there brands of litter that are known to be softer? Maybe I could try them just to see if they are preferred."
gradadmissions,fdpgq3p,t1_fdpfw1v,1578628179.0,Thank you so much!!
gradadmissions,fdp73br,t3_eme7vx,1578621531.0,Congrats!!! I will see you there too. :) It will be my first time visiting the area!
gradadmissions,fdm3wkd,t1_fdlrc1a,1578539194.0,"I applied last year to a PhD program (Fall 19) and they invited me for an interview. Before they invited me to the interview, I decided to spend an extra semester at my school for undergrad. I thought I had canceled my application, but apparently I didn't. When they invited me, I told them that I would not be able to start until the spring semester (over email). They still flew me out and ended up accepting me for the later semester after the other admits had started (I ended up declining and applying again this year). But it is possible to defer. If they want you, they will let you start later!"
gradadmissions,fdlxh37,t3_em286p,1578534835.0,"Hahaha, I was literally thinking about this on my drive home from work today. It feels so similar. I'm so glad somebody else thought the same thing! Interviewing with a bunch of people and feeling the same anxiety over your top choice. Looking back, it was so strange/overrated. 

Good luck with your interview, I'm sure you will do great! :)"
gradadmissions,fdf225s,t3_el1r79,1578351530.0,"My GRE scores were not good, and a lot of my apps had optional scores. I ended up not submitting them. What I eventually came to was that you should only submit scores if they are really high and will help out your application if you lack in other aspects (low GPA but high GRE). I think if you submit okay or bad GRE scores when they are optional, it could show a somewhat bad judgment of character. Also, then your scores will most likely be compared to the really high GRE scores of other applicants from the point made prior. Before I did this, though, I made sure that the lack of GRE scores would not imply anything to the admissions committee."
gradadmissions,fdf19ja,t1_fdeu1rn,1578351032.0,"Thanks. I have some great interviews lined up, but I have not heard anything back from the majority of the schools that I applied to. I guess it's really just my ego that is hurting. A lot of people told me that I would hear back from more than what I have. I am trying to remember it really just takes one acceptance, and that I applied to these schools for a reason (I really liked their program and research). I'm hoping for the best and trying to stay positive. :)"
gradadmissions,fdes1nn,t3_ekwzl9,1578345412.0,"I've applied to 12, and I feel really lucky to have 4 interviews, but I have not heard back from the other 8. I know 3 of those 8 are rejections, they just haven't sent the letter yet. I wonder if there is still any hope to hear back from the other programs?"
gradadmissions,fderj0a,t3_ekwvty,1578345106.0,Hi! I was wondering about when did all of your interviews come in after sending in applications?
gradadmissions,fdeqkqt,t1_fdea0k4,1578344541.0,I just went interview clothes shopping at White House Black Market! They are having their semi-annual sale right now.
gradadmissions,fcxd5xc,t3_ej9fya,1578059729.0,I think it depends on if you are applying to biophysics departments through the physics department (will be math and physics heavy- some require physics GRE or just any subject GRE) or through an interdisciplinary department (where I don't think the subject GRE is necessary).
gradadmissions,fcxcahg,t1_fctjfqg,1578058989.0,Congratulations!! Was it an interview or direct admittance?
gradadmissions,fcs6jm3,t1_fcs25cb,1577912136.0,"That helps- thank you! I am also applying to biochem and biophysics programs. Hopefully, I will hear back from some of the programs around then too."
gradadmissions,fcs6cmp,t1_fcs2xqn,1577912058.0,"Haha, understood... I am wishing you the best of luck!"
gradadmissions,fcryp80,t1_fcrxwet,1577908494.0,"Is this true? If no invite went out by now, then it is most likely a rejection?"
gradadmissions,fbwpjma,t3_eese4w,1577156023.0,"I applied to the Biochemistry & Biophysics track and I have not heard back. I saw on grad cafe that interview invites just started going out this past weekend. I think they will continue after the holidays, and it will depend on which track you applied to. I wouldn't worry! One rejection does not mean that other schools will do the same."
gradadmissions,fbw3ka1,t1_fbw24si,1577140278.0,I'm hoping they will send out the invites right after the holidays.
gradadmissions,fbw1wmg,t1_fbvz5bh,1577139356.0,"The Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology program. What about you?"
gradadmissions,fbvwqwk,t1_fbvv4ft,1577137201.0,"UCLA, UCSD,  Yale, UTSW, and Baylor College of Medicine. I'm really hoping to hear from UCLA soon, though."
gradadmissions,fbvuin0,t1_fbvtdpg,1577136262.0,Where else are you waiting to hear back from?
gradadmissions,fbvt47b,t1_fbvqqpt,1577135689.0,I guess I won't be either. I hope you've received some other interview invites at least!
gradadmissions,fbvnskc,t3_eeobf8,1577133479.0,I'm curious too. Have you contacted them and asked if interview invites have all been sent out?
