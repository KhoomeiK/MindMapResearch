I don't get that at all because I never get tired of these pictures. I find these colours soothing now."

It's like my collegue. We're both teachers, and I was talking about a student of ours who just got a boyfriend. He said: ""but I thought she had a girlfriend?"".
""Well she did, but that didn't work out, she's with someone else now"".
""Oh so she's not a lesbian anymore?""
...
""Are you aware that bisexuality is a thing?""
""But she was a lesbian before, she had a girlfriend"".

bisexual,ff8tv54,t3_es4lsq,1579695884.0,Haha awesome. When I told my boyfriend he just smiled and nodded and went on with his video game. Like I just told him we were going to have spaghetti for dinner or something. I love him.

bisexual,ff3lse8,t3_era9st,1579543770.0,"This is exactly why it's hard for bisexuals to talk about their sexuality. I never cared that I'm bi, but never talked about it as a teenager. I didn't know why. But recently I realised it was out of fear of this exactly. People not taking me seriously, people thinking I was just looking for attention,... 

And I realise now that it's totally a part of my identity and I should just be able to talk about it. And so should you!"

A friend of mine used to let her cats outside but there were 2 that got poisoned and one that came home with some kind of metal trap around its paw. There was a cat hater in their neighbourhood apparently. It was so terrible. She kept her cats indoors after that."

russianblue,fecvtwk,t3_emso3u,1578986632.0,"Indoor. I'd never want an outdoor cat, and here in Belgium every breeder puts in the contract that you're not allowed to let your cat go outdoors, unless in a catproof garden. A purebred cat would get stolen in a second. Aside from the many other dangers they face (being poisoned, run over, getting lost,...) I'd never ever want to risk it. I see so many messages on facebook from people where their cats haven't come home in a while, it's terrible.

I do take my cat out on a leash sometimes, she likes that!"

bisexual,fe35g1x,t3_ennz5s,1578846107.0,"It makes me so angry that other people think they have you all figured out. It's such a terrible thing to say it's ""just a phase"". Even if it would be, just let people be. Their sexuality and relationships are nobody's business but their own. 

This is why I didn't really come out at first, even though I've known I'm bi ever since I was a kid. I was afraid people would brush it off as just a phase/seeking attention, thinking it's not a big deal, while for us it's a huge deal.

You are a valid bisexual!"
bisexual,fe1pq8y,t1_fdvwfxt,1578829448.0,"Yes, for male homosexuality at least 5 genes have been discovered to be correlated with being gay. For lesbians and bisexuals, no genes have been discovered yet afaik, but I'm sure they're there! 

Also what someone alse replied to this post is true: women who have had multiple sons will have different hormone levels with each son during pregnancy, and younger sons are more likely to be gay.

But of course it's always a mixture of nature and nurture. But let it be clear that doesn't mean sexuality is a choice! Because some idiotic homophobes will think ""oh if it has to do with upbringing than maybe we can still turn it around"". Eeeh, nope. Not how thay works."

bisexual,fdhxvu2,t1_fdhabhr,1578432146.0,"That sounds great :D 

The thing is also that heterosexuals can have feelings similar to this as well. My boyfriend has times where he wonders ""what would my life have been like with another girl"". Not that he's not happy or anything, but everybody wonders. Same as for other things in life, like ""what if I had another job"".

I know it's not the same and I don't want to minimise how I sometimes struggle with the bi-cycle, because I do, but it does help me realise that everybody has things they struggle with. This just happens to be my thing. And I'm very happy to have a supportive partner in all this, who doesn't take these struggles personally and is always there when I need to to talk about it."
