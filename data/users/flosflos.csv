coolguides,ff8sm5r,t1_ff8ps6u,1579694505.0,Tylenol affects the liver if you take more than 4 gram per day for longer than 20 days. NSAIDs will affect your kidneys. For short term use it's best to alternate but Tylenol seems to be much safer overall since there are other repercautions associated with NSAIDs that you won't even know sometimes.
