movies,ffg16je,t3_etf4oe,1579896226.0,I was curious of his too. I know in the beginning there was a scene mentioning that Henry was being rewarded for pooping. He didn’t poop for a like a week or so? I don’t think this typical for an eight year old. He also was being carried in the end by Charlie. Idk if it was to show how tired he was.
