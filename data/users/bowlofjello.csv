You can usually get them from schools (if your school doesn’t you might be able to go to a local community college. They usually have them). From Planned Parenthood if you have any near you. You can buy them and use self checkout if you’re scared. You can buy them in some bathrooms in a vending machine. 

If the girl is on birth control, the pills need to be taken every day around the same time. The pill doesn’t protect against diseases so you should still wear a condom. If she misses a pill or isn’t on it and you don’t use a condom/ it falls off/ breaks/ there’s a hole, you’re super paranoid you can buy Plan B OTC at most drugstores.

If you have trouble getting the floss just that far back in your mouth, there are handles similar to a toothbrush where you can string your own floss through that will reach far enough back to floss. Or a regular pre-threaded floss pick. 

So I’d say unless you REALLY want it, or REALLY have trouble getting back there and NOTHING else works, go for it. Or else it’s kinda just a waste of money. 

It’s the difference between scrubbing your car after you get it muddy (floss), or just rinsing it off with a hose (waterpick)."

Other than that, go in to your dentist and let them know what you’ve noticed and how long it’s been going on. They will try to move your teeth, see if they’re sensitive to anything, and maybe check bone levels. Hopefully they will be able to give you an answer! 


Do you clench/grind your teeth at night or during the day? That might put pressure on your teeth that can make them shift a bit and maybe feel a bit wiggly.
