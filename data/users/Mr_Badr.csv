WatchPeopleDieInside,ff9op98,t1_ff6y98h,1579717449.0,"There is a vehicle my dad had for 12 years. SUV. Engine had a pretty distinctive sound. When we heard it turning into our street, we would clear out of all the common spaces in the house until we'd heard him walk in, go to his room and close his door. Then we would come back out. He had a very intimidating presence. And most of us compensated by making ourselves small. 

I'm in my 30s (and with my own family) now yet my heart jumps when I hear a similar engine sound.

I have two missed calls from him from a week ago and I'm both terrified to call him back (he can make or break my whole week) and anxious that he's getting more and more coldly angry with each passing day that I don't return his call."

She later on found out it was injured and had to get a brace. I was WRACKED with guilt and remorse for weeks on end and was super gentle and nice with her while she recovered. I hated what I'd done, and endlessly questioned whether I'd turned into one of those guys. 

And that was fully consensual play-wrestling.

This guy has no remorse, no compassion for his wife, and there was no respect for her body autonomy.  This is domestic violence."

AmItheAsshole,fdea8m5,t1_fde94d1,1578334603.0,">do you have to be from outside of america to understand the concept of not wanting to send your parents to prison?

Sorry, that is a generalisation on my part. 'JustNOparents' are not a uniquely American phenomenon but it seems that reddit has a singular approach towards dealing with them. Going by the heavily upvoted responses to various posts across the past decade I've been on here, I got the sense that - when a parent messes up in a way that could get them charged with a crime/misdemeanour or sued in civil court - the advice by and large was to go ahead and do it to seek justice or reparations. Almost always, there would be references within the responses that would pinpoint the comment/post as being by someone based in the US. Hence my previous comment. 

But I get your point, America is not a single amorphous entity with one way of doing things. 



>or do you think its simply because the internet warriors on reddit want absolute justice in all cases.. as long as it doesnt involve them?

Definitely a factor."

science,fde4d5q,t1_fdd0775,1578330907.0,"I'm in middle management in HR. There was one particular recruitment process my team did which just did not sit right with me. A really good candidate (let's call her Claire), with extensive prior experience in the role as a consultant, was passed over. The head of the department which was recruiting had given her good reviews and we both thought she was a shoo-in for the role. 

There was one of Claire's documents the in-house recruiter needed to run a check on, a simple process which I'd discussed before the interviews with my in-house recruiter. The recruiter made it seem like it would require a tedious amount of follow-up, I clarified, and promptly pushed it out my mind as I was busy.

The interview panel - which included one person from my team (HR) - and a supervisor from the hiring department ultimately settled on a middle-of-the-road candidate, which I found out after the process had been finalised. When I questioned my employee, she fell back on (IMO) feeble excuses relating to Claire's document which needed verification, and spoke in favour of the candidate that was selected (she apparently spoke multiple languages? Not sure why we took it into consideration when the role didn't call for it...). My employee was usually really good at her role but, this particular instance... it just did not feel kosher to me but, once again, I was incredibly busy at the time and I practise a relatively hands-off managerial approach, therefore I did not delve further into it.

I did wonder a few times though whether the fact that Claire was a very attractive woman who dressed **VERY** stylishly (think office-wear meets high-fashion) - and that the interview panel consisted of two women in their early thirties - had anything to do with the decision. I brushed my thoughts off as being ridiculous, so it's interesting to see it (possibly?) confirmed by a study."

(There is the odd occasion though... A few weeks ago, I went on a work trip in a different country. A friend who was an expat there invited me and two colleagues for dinner. His wife and mum went all out. *Multiple main dishes and multiple sides*. Table was creaking. Looked liked they'd been cooking from morning. Could have easily fed twice as many people, and had plenty left over. Smelled incredible. I was drooling. It was immediately apparent that my Pakistani friend had completely forgotten to tell his family about my IBS, despite us sharing multiple meals the past couple of days. *Every single dish was fiery hot.*

Being closer to him than the other two guests, I was sort of the 'main guest' and, if I ate nothing... ohh... hospitality is a *big deal* in my pal's culture, and he would be devastated that he forgot, and was not a good host. And his poor wife and mum who were keenly observing our enjoyment of the various dishes. However, if I *did* eat, I would be in excruciating pain for a couple of days, which I was not not particularly keen upon.
