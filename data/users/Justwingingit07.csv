BreakUps,ffe1beh,t3_et1vjk,1579834131.0,"Your heart is broken right now. And if you take him back you are probably going to be super aware of him on his phone, when he gets notifications you'll be curious, when he is in the bathroom too long or too often you'll wonder what's up (just assumptions based on my experience). This will start to drive you mad (again my experience). And then if it doesn't work out you'll be starting the breakup all over again. Yes it sucks to lose someone you truly love. Yes it sucks to be at home alone crying because you miss him. But it will suck even more to do it to yourself again in a week, a month, or a year. Now, it could go the opposite way. He could change his ways and it could very well work out. It is something only you can answer. 

I always thought my ex was messaging other women on insta. He could prove me wrong but something just felt off. Everytime his phone went off I was curious who it was. All the trips to the bathroom started to be more and more frequent. I want him back but I know deep down I can't trust him. I just don't want to be alone. And I won't be alone forever, just this time while I'm working on myself. Good luck."
BreakUps,ffd128v,t3_esri6e,1579811318.0,"I wonder if he dreams about me? I wonder if he is actually hurt too? He dumped me so he was probably ready. Already ran out of feelings or whatever. I just wish things were different. I wish I could just get over him. I'm tired of good day, good day, bad day, shitty day, shitty day, good day. I just wanna have good days again."
cats,ffcdfvp,t3_esuh33,1579797069.0,Happy Birthday Sunny
BreakUps,ffcctrz,t3_esv0e4,1579796689.0,Sounds like my situation. Heartbreaking for sure. Good luck. You'll get through this.
BreakUps,ffccp68,t3_esv6rp,1579796609.0,"Yes we are. 
I'm not ok rn either.
Baby steps.
Tomorrow WILL be better."

depression,ffbrwqz,t1_ffbr5or,1579780385.0,"Thank you. I have my good days and bad days. Two good days in a row but tonight I had 2 dreams about him and cannot stop crying. Soooo today is absolutely going to be a bad day. 

I have started working on myself however. Got back into journaling and sketching. Working out and trying to rekindle some friendships that I let go as a result of a new relationship. Starting classes next week to finish my degree. 

I know it's for the best but it sure does hurt like hell."
depression,ffbqvxy,t3_esrjpu,1579779123.0,Tell me about it. It's so effing hard to cope rn. Have you joined r/breakups? That has been a huge help for me.
depression,ffaqkks,t3_eshmfy,1579742164.0,"My depression and insecurities caused my relationship of 16 months to end a few weeks ago. I realize now I wasn't ready for another relationship. I need to fully work on myself and become secure in my skin before I get in a new relationship. It sucks because i don't want to be alone and being alone causes me more depression but there's nothing else i can do. 

I think it's important that you list your insecurities and flaws and make a conscious effort to work on them. Talk to your partner openly about the issues you face and ask for support in working through them."
depression,ffapaap,t3_esii2w,1579741301.0,"I first tried to commit suicide when I was 14. I'm 34 now. My most recent attempt was 2 years ago. I didn't tell my parents I was depressed until i was 27. I wish I would have reached out sooner but my parents and I did not have open dialogue. If I could go back and tell them when I first tried I would. Maybe I would have gotten the help needed back then that I am just get now. And maybe I wouldn't suffer as much as I do now. If you don't feel comfortable telling them, you can call the suicide prevention line and talk to someone. 1-800-273-8255 if you're in the US. There's plenty of help out there you just need to find the courage to ask and the sooner you do it the better."
BreakUps,ffa08ey,t3_esdf22,1579725252.0,"It's so strange that you would bring this up. My dad passed away unexpectedly in 4/17. I suffered from depression since my teen years but that loss (I was 31 at the time) really rocked me. I fell into a deep hole and still haven't recovered. In 4/18 I ended things with my baby daddy, we had been together 15 years. I felt that I was in a dark place and couldn't go on. I started a new relationship in 9/18 and that just ended this month. My dad's death has really done a number on me. I do go to therapy and am on meds for depression but I don't think I'll really ever overcome it. 

Because my dads passing was unexpected, I felt that anyone could leave me so I left my longtime boyfriend before he could leave me. There were other issues but my insecurities played a big role in both breakups to be honest. It's weird how a death can affect someone."
BreakUps,ff9q3qz,t3_esf838,1579718456.0,"I feel the same way. It's so hard realizing you can't someone you want so terribly. Everyone says it gets easier. I'm sure it does, I'm just too impatient to wait."
BreakUps,ff9pzyr,t1_ff9lbm6,1579718385.0,Thanks for suggesting top posts of all time. I'm going to look into that on days when I need more comfort.
ExNoContact,ff9h6sn,t3_esc78r,1579712938.0,Me too. I just need to realize it's never going to happen. Ever.
ExNoContact,ff9gz9i,t3_esapy8,1579712808.0,That's a good one. The days would be so much easier.
BreakUps,ff7ua8q,t3_ervz5f,1579658523.0,That is HUGE news!!! Congratulations!!
specializedtools,ff7txmj,t3_errx4p,1579658281.0,I found that so satisfying ðŸ˜€
BreakUps,ff60vdf,t3_eruoan,1579616256.0,Maybe you're not ready start dating yet. Maybe you need more time to heal.
BreakUps,ff5zkrf,t3_erqflq,1579615228.0,I feel the same way. It sucks. What gets me through is the fact that he didn't want me. So why waste my time and lower my self respect to beg someone to be with me? I deserve better. You deserve better. There's someone out there who will be worth it. Just give it time. I know it's easier said than done but it is oh so true.
BreakUps,ff5z1e1,t3_erpwjw,1579614792.0,I didn't get through your whole post. I started to tear up and I just don't want to cry anymore. I saved it and I will return to read it sometime. Just wanted you to know that i I appreciate your realness in what i did read. Things are tough but they will get better (or so I've been told!)
BreakUps,ff5ylja,t3_ercvz3,1579614430.0,"Thank you for posting. The mornings are the worst for me but this morning I woke up and kept telling myself ""do not cry, do not cry"" as I'm choking up in the mirror applying my makeup. ""He didn't want you. He didn't want to fix it. You deserve someone who wants you. Who is willing to work at a relationship."" It's hard but if I keep repeating it helps. I cannot wait for the morning I wake up and he isn't my first thought."
ExNoContact,ff3ou1p,t1_ff3og97,1579545655.0,"I deleted him from FB and Insta the night we broke up but then ended up deactivating my accounts a few days later. I deal with depression and anxiety and social media has really hurt my mental health as of late. Sometimes in the middle of the night I get the desire to look him up but it isn't going to make me feel any better so I fight the urge. I will be 2 weeks ""clean"" of social media Wednesday and I'm pretty proud of that lol! Baby steps!"
ExNoContact,ff3o6y1,t3_erh4qv,1579545256.0,"Oh girl I'm so sorry. It is tough, especially when you love someone so much. It is hard to function and not think about them. ""They"" say it gets easier but it takes so much time. I'm 2 days NC/ 2 weeks BU and not reaching out is killing me. I did talk to him at work today but kept my head down and avoided eye contact so I wouldn't cry. What is getting me through NC is the fact that he initiated it and I have to show him I respect his decision. Also that I respect myself enough to not go chasing him. If it's meant to be it will be, as cliche as it sounds. Take a shower, drink some water, go for a walk. It's ok to cry and be sad but try your hardest not to let it consume you. Love is tough but we can get through it."
ExNoContact,ff3nk9c,t3_ergrda,1579544873.0,"It is so hard, especially when there are still feelings betweenyou both.

 I (34F) fell for my ex (30M) 20 months ago and we became inseparable. We work together and we would hang out for beers after work. We started as friends and it turned into something more. In my past relationship (15years) I developed very low self esteem and that was the reason we broke up. I never felt good enough for him even though he reassured me I was. We had the best times together. So much fun doing anything. I hate that I let my insecurities ruin something so good. I know I need to work on myself but I just wish he could wait for me as selfish as it sounds. We broke up 2 weeks ago yesterday after a 16 month relationship. Just last Wednesday he picked me up from a dentist appointment and let me stay at his house until I was ready to go home that night. He came up to my place and ate dinner with me and hugged me before he left. It was an amazing day and I'd have oral surgery again if I could spend the day with him one more time!! I wish I had an answer for you. Just stick with your gut and don't avoid breaking up just because it is difficult."
ExNoContact,ff3jvqj,t3_erfdim,1579542605.0,"That has to be rough. Liars are the worst. Honestly at least you found out sooner rather than later when you were trying to rebuild a friendship. 

I deleted my ex's messages this morning. Still haven't worked up the nerve to delete him from my phone or block him yet. I know it's for the best but I'm just not ready."
BreakUps,ff3jls2,t1_ff3gux3,1579542438.0,"Unfortunately leaving isn't an option. I have 2 young kids and my job is very accommodating with their schedules. He did mention he was looking for something else so hopefully that will happen to make this transition easier. In the meantime I'm trying to avoid, avoid, avoid as much as possible."
ExNoContact,ff3jaxn,t1_feyyv8w,1579542252.0,I do need to work on my self esteem issues because it is something that has been bringing me down for awhile. I have been in relationships since I was 15 (I'm almost 35) so never having time to myself or actually being alone is new to me. I know it needs to happen just wish it was under different circumstances.
ExNoContact,ff3g1gs,t3_erfb04,1579540299.0,I am finding this group to be a helpful distraction. I pray we can all find peace sooner rather than later.
BreakUps,ff0brdz,t3_eqoiz3,1579467355.0,It's the worst. Been 2 weeks today and it sucks. We work together so I'll see him at work and I'll pretend like I'm ok in front of him but as soon as I get back to my office I break down and cry. I miss him and just want things back to how good they used to be. Worst heartbreak I've ever experienced and I am ready for it to be over.
