Cityofheroes,ffph0gq,t1_ffpf11g,1580094832.0,"I have a water/Rad sentinel and it does pretty well. Seems to be decent damage and survivability.

However, have a look at a fire/time blaster. Way more damage, good control from /time, and self-buffs from /time that make it feel like a regen sentinel with sped up recharge.

If you didn't know, a Blaster's first two blasts plus the first attack from the secondary can be used while mezzed, so you still have three attacks while held/asleep/whatever without having to be a sentinel. 
The Time immob is also a debuff that helps vs big bosses.

It's a lot of fun."

Cityofheroes,ff3gilg,t3_eq14k5,1579540565.0,"Coming late to this discussion, it's obvious the choice really depends on your playstyle and the level-ranges you play at.

As a Controller I always take both.  The immob is usually low-endurance and fast-recharge so I can use it more frequently than the hold for containment damage. I'll hold one critter and use it for my self-heal battery and use the immob on the other critters to defeat them. I exemp down for TFs and teams so want a full attack chain at any level.

The AoE immob is useful but costs too much endurance with too little damage to defeat a small spawn without using the single-target immob and hold.

So I'll AoE immob a spawn, then cycle through with the ST immob and hold to defeat them.

On teams and at higher levels if there's melee characters I often won't even use the AoE immob/hold so that the spawn can herd up on the melee toons. Once grouped-up though I unleash everything."

I tried all kinds of fire/\* combos and wound up with Fire/Time blasting and love it. 

I never used /Fire's swords so /Time's self-buffs are super useful.  I'm a bit unhappy the immob doesn't do damage but it stacks with the hold to hold bosses.  The self-buffs (one toggle, one auto)  mean I always have full health and stamina without having to click self-heals or go into melee for consume."

Another thing to keep in mind with what's been said is order of powers. So if there is content you like to play at certain levels you can use one AT or another to make sure you get the powers you want at 20/25/30/etc.

If you'd rather blast than buff go controller. I had a Kin/Ice defender and abandoned it for an Ice/Kin Corrupter."

DFB to 15; slot the P2w enhancements and any SOs that dropped.

Run Posi 1 and 2, Yin, etc, trade merits for Boosters and sell them on the AH. Do Ouro flashbacks to get badges & merits, get exploration badges from zones for merits, etc.

Buy Attuned enhancements and never worry about them again.  Get bonuses ASAP for long-lasting fun.

Toons don't have a lot of slots at these levels so it's not a huge expense to buy Attuned through the 20's and 30's and on up. After 50 can respec or use unslotters to swap in purples or AT sets, then put them in the base for new alts."
