&#x200B;

Diminishing the value of a three effectively diminishes the value of every shot that isn't right at the rim (same amount of points, but lower efficiency).

&#x200B;

Low fg% and probably loss of possession are enough of a balance to the extra point from shooting behind the arc.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The Warriors made it trendy to shoot threes, but it mostly worked for them because they had 2-3 of the 5 best shooters ever to play basketball for a pretty solid stretch. Even the Rockets with two MVPs in James Harden and Russel Westbrook haven't been able to copy the Warriors. As teams continue to lose, and guys like Giannis continue to dominate the MVP conversation, the style of play will change. It already is."

&#x200B;

Zubac can probably do more, but the Clippers don't need midrange shooting out of him if he's already doing well in his current role - especially not when they're likely to have 2 or 3 better midrange shooters on the floor at all times. He's doing great in his role though. He'd probably do even better with more minutes, but not all players do. 

&#x200B;

He's right to take those shots if he gets a good look, and he'll keep getting them throughout the season and playoffs. He's already come a long way from A1 league, and it's still unlikely that his current usage rate is the ceiling.  


  
PS: Damn, the Clippers' Scouts must be geniuses to target the Rockets' 2nd round guy in Harrell, and Zubac, who the Lakers had bouncing between the bench and the D-League"
AmItheAsshole,ffbbwi6,t3_esovvf,1579758978.0,"NAH - this is an immature fight between siblings. You need to stop riling your sister up over things you don't care about when you know it upsets her. She doesn't need to hold things against you forever. This is just kid drama; you clearly don't have the emotional maturity to handle losing all these arguments against her, and she hasn't developed the empathy to see what's driving you to say these kinds of provocative things. I'd be kind of an asshole if I sat here demanding perfection in those areas out of kids who live together.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But if you were adults, you'd be the asshole in this situation and it wouldn't even be close. It sounds like you just picked a thing that you knew would make her mad, and used it to get under her skin until she just got really mad at you. That's not winning an argument at all. That's just being an asshole until somebody wants nothing to do with you.

&#x200B;

But to be fair, she was wrong about some stuff too. You wouldn't get prosecuted or jailed for whatever it was you said, because there aren't laws that protect trans people from that kind of ignorance.

The Cardiac Clippers improve to 7-1 in games decided by 3 or fewer points, despite shooting under 40% as a team. 

Kawhi plays his 6th 30+ pointer in a row

Kawhi must've anticipated 60% or more of Luka's attempted kickouts to the corner. I've never seen somebody deflect the same pass so consistently.

&#x200B;

JaMychal Green got double digits in boards and single digits in scoring again, bringing his pts and reb averages within 0.3 of eachother for the season.

&#x200B;

Zubac followed his 1-5 night in New Orleans with a 2-8 night in Dallas. Just one point and one rebound from a double-double, though.

&#x200B;

Pat Beverly weirdly had a more accurate shooting night than Lou Williams in this one - perfect from downtown, 60% fg, but only took 5 shots.

&#x200B;

Jerome Robinson has another terrible shooting night. He at least managed a few assists and steals, though.

&#x200B;

Mo Harkless got in foul trouble early, and

Shamet seemed to be ready to shoot most of his shots before he even caught the ball.

&#x200B;

Mavs played a hell of a lot better in the 4th tonight than they did in their first game. This team is going to be really good for a long time if they stay together.

&#x200B;

Boban had a very solid night.

&#x200B;

Luka had a great night too, but he couldn't take advantage of a lot of his late free throw attempts. He looked really upset to be on a Kawhi Leonard poster. Had some incredible rebounds, though.

&#x200B;

Porzingis went 10 and 9, on 4-17 shooting. He got outplayed by Boban and Zubac. This was a bad night for my fantasy team.

&#x200B;

Tim Hardaway Jr. continues to have a bad time against playoff teams.

I know I'll get downvoted for this, but it'd really suck to give up an important rotation player for Rose, only to see Rose get injured right before or during the playoffs. I'm not saying it's a guarantee he'll get injured - I'm saying he is famously injury-prone, and it's a higher risk with him than a lot of other guys.

The best-case scenario I can see from a call like this is  if the Pistons think the Clippers are serious, and it makes Rose more expensive or unattainable for a Western Conference Rival to get."
