I'm starting to get the impression that at least in the US this FA stuff is more mainstream than thinking that obesity is a problem. And if it isn't yet, I bet it'll be the next area the left-wing wokesters claim as their next fronteer battle after they've won all their current trans-battles..."

fatlogic,ffes1n2,t3_et7zjk,1579862756.0,Congrats for the weight loss! That is awesome!

fatlogic,ff8xn68,t1_ff8mynz,1579699410.0,Wouh! My MBI would go from 23 to 36 :D. Holy shit!
fatlogic,ff2ro5k,t1_ff225tp,1579521113.0,"I do have an MC driver's license and have driven a few thousand miles on it (never competitive), so am kind of wondering how do you lose weight on that? Aren't you just mostly sitting on your ass? I realize that your hart rate is probably up due to the excitement and it's takes some energy to hang on at high speeds etc, just don't see how one can consume 3.5kcal/day and not gain weight in that sport?"
fatlogic,fejdvgn,t1_feh9b9l,1579169240.0,"Wouldn't you say that Mao, Stalin, Lenin etc. all had IQs waaaay above 80? If you read any of their writings you have to admit that these guys were very, very smart. Yet the end result was roughly 100,000,000 dead human beings. I'm not a fun of US foreign policy etc., but whatever you want to label as ""capitalist"" has been far less disastrous than that."
fatlogic,fe6sa8k,t3_enqqdd,1578903021.0,Anyone here have any articles I can read about influenza that doesn't link it to a virus?
fatlogic,fdjfmjd,t1_fdhxn95,1578468740.0,"You're probably right that I remember the dinosaur species incorrectly, but the point still is that organisms are built of parts and those parts put in fundamental limits on how much things e.g. can weight and still stay alive. Another such limit that HAES doesn't want to acknowledge is that beyond a certain weight a human can't walk because the legs can't support the body weight. All of these are yet other examples of how HAES insist that laws of physics don't apply to them."
fatlogic,fdgsw8h,t3_el4ptk,1578407476.0,"Actually there is a point, because the red blood cell that carries oxygen to the body can only do so on a certain body size. The horizontal limit is roughly that of T-rex (which is why nothing larger than it has really existed) and the vertical limit is roughly that of a blue whale (as above). Now, obviously no-one advocating HAES is that big vertically or horizontally, but that doesn't mean that such a limit doesn't exist. For us humans the limit is pretty much the capacity of the heart to tolerate such weight and that varies individually but seems to be reached by 1,500 lb for everyone and by roughly half that size for most humans."
fatlogic,fcx98dt,t3_ej6554,1578056159.0,I think we need to a person becoming healthier after losing weight! That's the only way to eliminate the appeal of weight loss once and for all and to fix the greatest injustice any society has ever faced anywhere on any planet in any universe!
fatlogic,fctujsl,t1_fcsjb49,1577960262.0,I currently live in a country where people seem to genuinely believe that leaving a window open when someone is at the house results in that person being exposed to draft and hence getting sick.
fatlogic,fcttuq8,t3_eimgv0,1577959228.0,"I love it how FA's put persons making movements as their emoijs, whereas they themselves are probably not equally active or they wouldn't be as fat."
fatlogic,fcmw779,t3_ehs0xu,1577795076.0,"I actually love the word ""Obese"", because it's perfectly descriptive. While someone may be overweight after eating a normal amount due to thyroid issues, genes, PCOS etc., to become actually obese, requires that you simply eat way too much. Of course being overweight, but not yet obese, also requires that you eat too much, but at least in that case there may be a valid underlying condition for it that simply isn't ""too much food""."
fatlogic,fbg19pj,t1_fbfru73,1576829364.0,"Yeah, H stands for Hitler, which you have to support since you mentioned the word and it also means you have to be a white supremacist, perhaps even a white supremacy race scientist!"
