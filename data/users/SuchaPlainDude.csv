AskReddit,febsdlg,t1_feboynp,1578962162.0,"Alibaba isn't one vendor, it's multiple vendors. Also, they love drop shippers because it doesn't require any extra investment from them. They often speak Mandarin and some English (and tons of emoticons). Having people drop ship is free translations and advertising to a market outside their norm. There are even secondary companies that have popped up to let you drop ship from Taobao."
