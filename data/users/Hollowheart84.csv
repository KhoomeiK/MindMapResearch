AskReddit,ff1idek,t3_er4xy2,1579479693.0,You could go the Vincent van Gough route and give them your severed ear in a festive decorative box.
MakeMeSuffer,fey9l6z,t1_fey9gaq,1579442573.0,It is an “anomaly” this is all I’ve been told-just one of those things!!

MakeMeSuffer,fey8mhl,t1_fey7niv,1579442160.0,I’ve always been abnormally flexible- like double jointed- all my joints are very flexible- but my ankle is just significantly more so. The joints in my fingers are so overly mobile that when I try to put my finger straight- or point straight ahead they point up because they bend too far in the wrong direction.
MakeMeSuffer,fey71wr,t1_fey6s4t,1579441598.0,"I don’t know I’ve tried for my whole life to get a diagnosis but, have never gotten a solid one. No one else in my family has any joint issues- just me.. uggg- and yes I’d love to hear about your mother’s issues- might help me in trying to figure out my own!!"
MakeMeSuffer,fey5pp9,t1_fey5bkp,1579441154.0,"Well, it doesn’t hurt. Right now the joint is completely numb- the only pain it causes is when I fall and hurt another part of my body- that’s why I’ve never had any type of surgery on it- I’m afraid I would start to feel the joint at some point!! I really don’t want that!!"
MakeMeSuffer,fey4yhu,t1_fey4osq,1579440842.0,Me either I’ve had it checked for years and no one has ever really been able to tell me what’s wrong with it.
MakeMeSuffer,fey49ti,t1_fey44yl,1579440680.0,No idea- no injuries to that ankle- it’s just always been that way- over the years the cartilage has just worn away and it’s gotten progressively worse!!
MakeMeSuffer,fey41ry,t1_fey3vhk,1579440554.0,I have fallen many times- I almost fell at my wedding because of it- I have to wrap it and I wear boots A LOT!!!
MakeMeSuffer,fey3mvt,t1_fey3g8q,1579440366.0,Yea I can pop it out at Will- and it does it on its own as well- sucks when I’m walking and it just slips out- I end up falling A LOT!!
MakeMeSuffer,fey304t,t1_fey2r0n,1579440085.0,Years- the joint is numb feel pressure but no pain- I’ve yet to get a solid diagnosis for what is wrong with it.
MakeMeSuffer,fey2d4p,t1_fey0de5,1579439800.0,Always a fun time! Cartilage got kicked out of the party completely!!

relationship_advice,feu27mq,t3_eqmgey,1579382401.0,If he’s sending money and you guys are struggling that is basically a slap in the face- if he isn’t pulling his weight- instead of confronting him directly mention how you need more of a financial contribution from him because you’re struggling pretty hard with expenses- if after that conversation he continues to disregard and disrespect you by not helping out and throwing money at some random chick I say walk away!!
MakeMeSuffer,feu1jwt,t1_fetwwtr,1579382166.0,You too!! I know it’s a struggle sometimes!!
MakeMeSuffer,fetv0g9,t1_fetubup,1579380310.0,"My ankle just randomly dislocated when I’m walking- and causes me to fall a lot- I’ve never gotten a clear diagnosis for what actually causes it- I have many hyper-mobile joints- my wrists- fingers, shoulders- but this left ankle is the most prominent and problematic."
MakeMeSuffer,fettehq,t1_fett1a0,1579379855.0,The ankle joint is almost completely numb- my ankle is jacked up pretty bad so sometimes I have to roll the joint around and crack it so i don’t feel so much pressure in my ankle

UnsentLetters,femc0bx,t1_felkqu7,1579247917.0,It absolutely can!! No one should ever have to be treated that way- or made to feel that way!!
UnsentLetters,fekulf4,t1_fektzky,1579207917.0,That is true- I just didn’t want a guy who was treating you that way to get a pass- because I’ve had an ex do that to me and it was torture!! I couldn’t bring myself to blame him for years and I didn’t want someone else to let a guy like that have a pass- I’m not excusing her- she was an ass hole to do that- and it is unacceptable behavior- but it could not and would not have happened if HE didn’t allow it!! He should’ve shut it down before it started!!
UnsentLetters,fejiagn,t3_ep9mec,1579175478.0,"I don’t mean this in a bashing way- but, from what you posted- you’re directing your anger at the least guilty individual. This girl had no obligation to protect your feelings, she had no obligation to consider them- HE DID- he was responsible for setting boundaries he refused to set- HE was responsible for shutting that stuff down that ANY person would no is unacceptable- I understand you care/cared about him- but, you’re absolving him of responsibility for his own actions ( or lack of action) and that is not being honest with yourself. Yes what his ex did was shitty- but, him allowing that behavior, accepting that behavior, even inviting that behavior is the real culprit in this scenario!!
I’ve been in your position before- and it’s hard to endure- But don’t let him off the hook so easily!!"
