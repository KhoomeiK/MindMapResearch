Advice,fed0mn2,t3_eoiqz6,1578992721.0,"well, you can think of it in 2 ways. 
im 21F btw

1- she's actually busy, BUSY. my boy & i had the same problem. I was super busy at uni & he wants to go out. he too has low self esteem though he's the kindest & most beautiful guy I've ever met. But he took it badly when we couldn't meet or text everyday. We talked seriously & now he understands. Turns out I actually have to tell him how amazingly, loving & supportive he is. The constant & HONEST appreciation towards him made us go a long way together. He now understands I'm in my senior year & I'm busy so instead of him being mad about it, he checks up on me & my sleep schedule!! there have to be an honest conversation between you too!

2- her pushing out the dates /not texting might mean she's actually confused & want to be honest with you. Check up on her & see if she's doing okay. Family problems  & mental issues usually prevent us from taking good responsible decisions 

and lastly, if she doesn't wanna see you or go out with you it doesn't mean you're bad at all. you can be good lookin, nice & kind but she doesn't connect with you! It's okay! You're only 19. You will eventually end up with someone who loves you without even you trying to impress them."

of course I don't talk generally. not everyone who uses the social media is an addict. but it's human.


>If you feel like Smithereens is about you, you have a huge problem. Not just an addiction problem but accepting responsibility for your actions problem. It's easy to blame others or the world for your mistakes and your lack of control.

omg EASY!! I don't think it's about me & I'm well aware that Chris takes full responsibility in the accident -it is not smithereens's fault! He could've turned off his data/disabled the notification! 
I feel for Chris because he had to live with remorse & nothing ,even group therapy, could take the pain away.


>Out of all Black Mirror episodes, this one made me feel with the ""main character"" the least. Or rather, I felt MUCH more with Billy and Jaden than I could with Chris. Chris is a mad man who blames everyone but himself for his mistakes. He's so willing to reject any responsibility for his own actions that he would point a gun at an innocent person and threaten to kill him just so he can talk with someone. Seriously, if you don't consider this extremely messed up, you need to really deeply rethink it.


please take it easy on me! actually, Chris admits that he's in the wrong. He literally said ""I killed her"". He had no intention to kill the man he kidnapped (it's also messed up, sht like this can give u trauma) he wanted to talk with billy. It's messed up honestly.



-Chris is traumatized, he knows it was his fault. 
Billy has no control over his app , when he said "" that's not what I intended when I made this app"" he said that there are people who take care of his work & teams to make ""dopamine""  rush. So you can't just completely say that smithereens isn't messed up too. 

-Chris is dead . but some of us, the viewers, are desensitized ! that's what I love about the credits part! we just don't care any more."

Some people have suicidal thoughts & depression not due to traumatic events or serious life problems. Some of us were born with it. We want to end our lives ( though sometimes we have great friends , a loving family & a promising career) because we can't enjoy these things. We are : depressed. Our chemicals are messed up.


>This is a really weird take. There's no point in living cause I hate beimg alive, and dying would fix literally all my problems, so there's definitely a point to dying.

Dying will only end the pain, there are many ways you can end the pain without killing yourself.
