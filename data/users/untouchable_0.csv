Neoliberalism is literally what Republicans want.  More privatization and less regulation.  Yet he is arguing that about people who wanted more regulation.  Proof being that trump is repealing regulations put in place by Obama, hence trump is the neoliberal in this argument, as deregulating is one of the hallmarks of neoliberalism."
