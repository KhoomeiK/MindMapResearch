ADHD,ffycpb3,t1_ffyb2ms,1580343287.0,"The problem that I have with this is I kinda feel that I wasn't taken seriously, I did an interview with a psychologist and and an interview with her( the psychiatrist), it made me feel like they didn't believe I have these symptoms, since they were only concerned about the hyperactivity part of ADHD. On the other hand, I feel that this test could somehow show that I don't have ADHD even though I do."
depression,ffuq0nx,t1_fftk9u2,1580247113.0,"Actually thinking about it, she used to joke about putting fake smiles and being sad from the inside, but I thought that they were just some edgy jokes, also sometimes she had explosive emotional responses to situations that can be described as usual.
I think we are close enough to suggest that she could count on my help, but the problem is that we don't live in the same city anymore, after high school we both left our home Town."
depression,ffs2iux,t1_ffs1l8u,1580171541.0,"I kinda understand, it's hard for us to talk about mental health in my country because this culture doesn't exist, most people think that if you go to a psychiatrist  you are a crazy person.
How do you think I can let her know that I'm there for her, and that she can ask for my help anytime she wants?"
depression,ffs20ul,t1_ffs1qt1,1580171197.0,"How can offer my help whilst not pressuring her to letting me help her? Should I be subtle about it, or should I say that she can ask for my help anytime she wants?"

When you seperate religion from the state, you can have democracy(not saying it's the only reason, but it's a big factor), and we saw that in every other arab country, whenever there is a ""revolution"", muslim parties rise to power (even in morocco)"

NoStupidQuestions,fev3y0u,t1_feuw2rm,1579392852.0,"I thought about it, and I think the real reason many many many people in my country, and other arab countries, seem to like hitler, is the reason why most people hate him, the Holocaust, as you may know, arabs and jews are not best friends, and that's due to many reasons (although I think islam might be the biggest reason), so they glorify hitler for that, because they also see jews as sub-human race. And they think hitler was right by killing them. 

I think that's fucked up of course, and wrong, we should not judge people based on religion. And all humans are equal. But I think it's interesting ( and quite honestly frightening) how ideology can play  a huge part affecting the moral compass of people, and that explains a lot of conflicts in human  history."

NoStupidQuestions,feuulaq,t1_feurn22,1579390088.0,"I think my point is, if they are both bad, they should be both equally condemned, when people are holding the nazi flag it's trashy, but it's okay to play ussr anthem or glorify communism, they should both be considered trashy."

Morocco,feeyd2a,t3_ehpjbp,1579043918.0,"Ok, I hate how people in morocco have very negative thoughts about drugs, but I think it's understandable due to the fact that most people who use it are thugs and..., you should have the freedom of choice, you should have the information and then make your choice accordingly, and be very careful with yoir consumption, to get adderall, I don't advise the black market unless you have a testing kit, yoi should go to doctor, and get a prescription, ( psychiatre not psychologue), if you don't have ADHD I doubt that you will get a prescription easily, but you can get it. Personally, I think if you don't have some attention deficit problem, adderall won't do you any good, sure it will keep you awke(but so does caffeine, and you can find it in pills if you don't like coffee) but you won't feel the same effects as someone with an attention disorder.
You might wanna check out r/adderall for some other informations, and ask there if you have additional questions."

Morocco,feeupm9,t1_fdqre7l,1579041620.0,"No, that's not the case, indeed rap in morocco started that way, writing about social problems, because of the lack of other medias that can do this job(Facebook for exemple), but now people are fed up, when you read everyday in facebook about poverty, rape, arrests and..., the last thing you wanna do is listen to music about the same things, most of music produced in morocco now is  feel good music, it's a way for people to escape reality. Now I'm not saying that I like moroccan rap music now, I think it reached its peak in 2017, and it went downhill from there, most from of rappers now are Americans wannabees . And of course there is still some rappers that rapp about social phenomenons, like slammeur or morphine..."
