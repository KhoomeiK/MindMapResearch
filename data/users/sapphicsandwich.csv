I agree with you completely. I'm a bit confused by our society acceptance of actually fucking kids, but not taking pictures of them. The reasoning behind legalizing porn of people under 18 makes sense, but it seems like it would also make sense for illegalizing having sex with people under 18. But that's not the case in many states. And in some states, you can have sex with a girl as young as 10 as long as you can get her parents to sign her over in marriage (looking at you Tennessee.)

It just drives me batty that we can all agree that kids that young are unable to consent due to their lack of cognitive development, but at the same time we have all these legal loopholes for fucking them and a kid that is cognitively too young to consent can simply step over state lines and now they're suddenly seen as cognitively developed enough to consent just fine."

One of them had terrible customer service and on top of that actually assigned my account number to a person who created a new account. Naturally, they cleared the account out when they saw there was more money in there than they deposited, and the credit union gave me an extremely hard time about it, insisting that I just spent more than I realized. That I needed a budget. After 20 mins of pleading, they begrudgingly looked at their security footage and lo-and-behold it was a person with a different car and of an obviously different race emptying my bank account at the ATM out front of the Credit Union.

Hrmm. More than a dozen separate rocket attacks on bases housing Americans since October. They're averaging like 4 per month, or one a week. But naw, there's no way this could be evidence of attacks in the near future."

DO they? No matter how shitty a company is, when your only other competitor is *Hughes Net* (shudder), they can really do whatever that want, and shit policies like this make it seem like they know it too.

They said if we roll a truck the same day this time, and next time they don't have one available that day, then the customer will be even more mad and demand that a truck be sent that day because they ""know you can send one same day because you did it last time.""

I'm a little dubious on the benefit doing it that way provides, but that's how it was done there."
