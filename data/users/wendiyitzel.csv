About the main ""issue"", I suggest you to give you some time alone (use the moments when you sre not with her or anybody) and to JUST WATCH your thoughts toward your relationship, accept that they are part of you in the relationship as THOUGHTS, not as your real intentions and above all, your decisions about you in the relationship. You said that you do not want to hurt her, but you also mentioned that you do not want to loose her... Take it as a motivation, because it is showing that you care about her. And when you are with her, and the thoughts pops up, let them be and do not judge anything about them, because it is what make us to stick with them. It is a training, and we deserve to be mentally stable while giving and receiving love or respect or all the things related with the relationship."
ROCD,fflvekj,t3_eu4zzc,1580044616.0,"Look, the thing with avoiding and feeling good is that it is your way of compulsion, but also it is a contraindication. I think that is important if you want to be with your partner or not, and keep like ""fighting for it"". So you may, compassionately, try to watch your thoughts as something that happens and is being part of your life, not as the way that you decided your life to be based (like your core values, your way to do the things and so on), and it is step by step (that is important) . It is very difficult because we do often get lost in our own minds and do believe in everything that is there, when the truth is that our brain is just an organ that is not even close to be in our control, so are the thoughts that pops up.

Also, when you think in your partner and the good things, try to focus on them intentionally. Watch him, the good moments and the bad ones too, and remember that that is your relationship and you decided to go with it even though you are having a menthal situation (and you are deciding it every time... Just look that you are encouraged to look for a solution).

And the following could be very difficult, but is important to communicate to your partner what's going on, because we as people sense when we are being avoided. So it could be good to tell to your partner, in a compassionately way too, that tou are having intrusive thoughts and it is causing this or the other thing.

And for the last one, remember that you are not alone and you have a lot of people going with similat situations as yours and they can understand you. Because we usually go for our friends or family or even the partner to tell them how we are, but they can not understand fully."

Panama,fdhm4ad,t3_elfgj3,1578425557.0,"Mi práctica profesional fue remunerada. Creo que es una excusa que utilizan las empresas en países como el nuestro (donde se aplica ésta dinámica) para no pagarte por tu esfuerzo y tus productos, que aunque no están a nivel de un trabajador ya experimentado, aún así representan un aporte para los objetivos de la empresa. No creo que la falta de experiencia o que aún no estés graduado sean razones para evitar que te paguen, pues en todo trabajo pueden dar entrenamientos, que de añaden a los conocimientos ya obtenidos(que supuestamente son los adquiridos en la universidad)."
