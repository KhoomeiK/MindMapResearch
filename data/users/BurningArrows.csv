Half-swording was a historical swordfighting techniques in which the user gripped their blade in order to strike with the guard or pommel, primarily against armored targets. Usually part of the blade was duller than the rest, but even a full blade can cut to some effect.

Of course, grabbing a knife isn't a good idea, but it is entirely possible to grab one and not get cut. My original comment is exaggerated, I know, but apparently everyone thinks that just because something is sharp it means it will automatically cut you.

Will you climb a ladder of knives and not get cut? Maybe. If you're careful. Doesn't mean it's a good idea. And yes, I understood the metaphor in the image."
