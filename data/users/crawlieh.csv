NotHowDrugsWork,fdu19te,t1_fdtwua6,1578725735.0,Impossible to what? Have sex on weed? Or to do stupid things while high?
NotHowDrugsWork,fdtp3lc,t1_fdtmvtw,1578720023.0,This is my whole point - is this guys story bs? Likely. Is it impossible? No. Saying what effect is “realistic” for people to get from drugs is literally gatekeeping drugs.
NotHowDrugsWork,fdtnhks,t1_fdtmvtw,1578719326.0,"Again :D gatekeeping smoking weed. It can really have different effects. Having sex while high is great, it’s not intense like on other drugs perhaps, but it is very sensational. 
Sometimes you just fall asleep or zone out, sometimes you power through it and you can do active stuff. I’ve went jogging while high for example, it’s a whole experience if you don’t lie down on your couch and eat a kilo of Doritos."
NotHowDrugsWork,fdtkiva,t3_emzuni,1578718081.0,"Tbf I disagree, weed can have very different effects, I think the one whos arguing is quite cringe “uhh ive been a heavy smoker for years man, I can tell you for sure, I do many drugs” and this belongs to r/Gatekeeping."
