One says to Job that even though you think you did nothing wrong, you must have done something because otherwise God wouldn't be punishing you. Another says God must be testing you etc, etc. What Job says in all this is not that he is innocent, what he simply says is that all the suffering is meaningless. There is no ideological or theological explanation or justification.

Now God comes along at the end of these discourses and explains to Job that what does he know, where was he when the universe was being created? This is usually interpreted as God being arrogant and calling Job a little twerp, but Chesterton interprets it as God being just as perplexed at the state of the universe as Job was. God says you think you are in trouble? Look at the position I am in! God abdicates and is in an equal state of despair."

So what if chimps are social animals. Chimps will go on the war path and kill any chimp that isn't part of their troop. That is expedient and a good thing to do for chimps. Some people thinks it is a good thing to do for humans. If you value what is natural and innate like empathy then you MUST also value xenophobia and violence because that is also natural and innate. Which brings us full circle to the small point I was trying to make in the first place: natural does not equal good because if it does that why value alleviating suffering rather than inflicting it in the interest of self-preservation of those who share our genetic material? How do you order these values? Without objective moral values you cannot as a society place these values in a hierachy... which is the point Nietzsche made so clear. That is nihilism. I do not think, and nor does any Christian I know, that without Christianity we would be raping and pillaging tomorrow, what we ACTUALLY think is that there is no hope to argue from a position of objective truth that the person raping and pillaging was wrong and should stop. Truth becomes subjective, all values lose their mooring and what becomes right is just the result of which conception of right has the most power backing it. This is why I keep going on about the pagan civilization of old, you have to look at a pre-Christian world to see just how wildly notions of 'good' and 'civilization' can vary based on different orderings of those values.

I never said Christians invented not to kill and don't steal. Have the intellectual integrity to not straw man my position at every possible turn. As for the long list of crimes of Christians in the past....for sure! Preach it. Never let Christians forget it. I am not arguing that Christians are better people, I am arguing that Christaintiy has certain moral claims , held as absolute truths, that have gone onto to fundamentally steer our civilization in a very specific direction. And that without believing in those absolute truths, we are lost at sea.

We're civilized because as a society we have had a shared conception of what was good that could be striven towards. Without an objective moral system, which you yourself says does not exist, then how can you possibly as a society have a shared conception of good? Why value charity? Why value human life? Why do we all think that the State has no right to kill a single innocent individual, even if it is expedient? Why not starve Ukraine as Stalin did, just because it was necessary to progress towards his idea of 'good'. You do not find the inalienable human rights that formthe basis of our entire civilization in genetics, evolution or nature. They exist because of a rich, ongoing, painful process working towards the realization of certain fixed principles. You cannot have the sort of progress - of which we are all the beneficiaries - unless there is a shared ideal that people tirelessly work towards for century after century. That ideal is not found in reason and science. As David Hume pointed out, you cannot get an ought from an is."
unitedkingdom,ffepqmm,t1_ffealn5,1579859299.0,"I just don't understand how you can be so blissfully unaware of where our shared conception of the 'good' comes from. It isn't inherent or axiomatic. If it was then it wouldn't have taken till the 1800s for slavery to be abolished. It takes millennia of civilizational development based on a common conception of the 'good' in order for all these things to develop. In the west, it was Christianity that formed that common understanding. Why is it good to care about the suffering of your fellow man and to show compassion? Why don't we have the same view as Alexander the Great and that of the ancient great civilizations in thinking that pride, power and greatness were to be pursued at all costs. If that meant raping and pillaging then so be it, that was necessary for the pursuit of their 'good'. Goodness is defined not by reason but by first principles, and in the west those first principles came from Christianity. Reason tells you how to actualize the good once it has already been agreed upon. Reason is directed and channeled, but without this direction reason on its own leads to nothing but nihilism. Go read Nietzsche and postmodernism if you don't believe it. It ain't a Christian apologetics argument, it has been made by those who most fiercely condemn Christianity. 

All the things you take for granted and claim are far superior to Christianity comes from the enlightenment....well where does the Enlightenment comes from? Why did it happen in the west of all places, why does it posit the existence of God as the basis for the existence of objective truth that is discoverable? We live in an nihilistic age where values have lost all their mooring to something concrete. That you don't even realize it is because you haven't thought about it hard enough, or I would say, seriously enough. So smear me all you like, at least I notice what tree we sit in as a society and I have the sense not to saw off the branch we are in this day and age precariously sitting on."
unitedkingdom,ffdpzs6,t1_ffdldkk,1579826187.0,"Rape was seriously punished in ancient times? Well yeah, you can't get away with raping the emperor. But have you never heard of sex slaves? A lot of what the New Testament says about sex was in the context of sex slavery and prostitution going on in the city of Corinth and St Paul was telling believers to abstain from it entirely and depart from how the Romans and Greeks understood sex. Even Zeus and many of the Greek gods were depicted as engaging in acts of rape and was not at all regarded as immoral for doing so. They were praised and the elites sought to emulate their example of pursuing their desires! Christianity is often depicted as being sexually repressed and puritanical and this is because people just have no idea what society was like before Christianity arrived. The pagan world of the Romans treated slaves as inhuman, property and mere objects to be used. The Romans had the same term for ejaculate as they had for uninate. The orifices of slaves were literally akin to urinals. This might sounds absurd and disgusting, but that is because we take as axiomatic such things as human dignity, which is the idea that Christianity instilled. Paul called a man and woman to have only one sexual partner, within marriage. We now call this prudish, but in the span of history this is a position for which we should be deeply appreciative of and not scoffing at like bunch of snarky teenagers who have no clue what the alternatives once were....and may well be again if the current consensus of 'do what feels good' is taken to its logical conclusion. As Nietzsche predicted, we live in the moral carcass of Christianity, the horizon has been wiped away, and nihilism has taken its place. Yuppee, what a triumph to be celebrated as is clear in this comment section!

My comment on food was simply saying that a thing being natural and basic doesn't mean it shouldn't be regulated. Moderation applies to all things, including sex. 

As for sex having all those benefits, Christians would agree. The point where Christians part from the rest of western society is in saying that we shouldn't be going at it like a bunch of bonobos, regarding sex as only having the meaning that each individual attributes to it. That is to say, the Christian differs in saying that Nihilism is wrong: not every choice is equally good, truth is not subjective. To argue today that there are objective moral values regarding issues like sex is scoffed at. But to live in a society that says everything is determined by the individual is completely unlivable."
