I also personally believe that the US should adopt Japan's drunk driving laws, which are a legal limit of .03% and if caught **every** person in the car gets a DUI, not just the driver. Because they knowingly got in a car with someone who had a drink and decided to drive. 

It adds a little more incentive to not do that.
