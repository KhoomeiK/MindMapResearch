houston,ffn368y,t1_ffmdesq,1580061539.0,"Absolutely right.  Single solid line is still legal to cross. Just discouraged. But legal.  I remember 59 south to 610 N used to have a solid white line from damn near the Weslayan entrance making a 59s to 610n interchange quite discouraged.  


... Now if you are using this to cut in line, then you're contributing to congestion and being a selfish prick.   Of course if you're already in line and actively preventing someone from making a legal merge over a solid white line, then you're also being a dick and contributing to traffic as well."
