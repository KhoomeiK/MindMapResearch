I like Dobermans. I'm not getting one but I used to look into it. The last thing I would personally want or need is an out of standard overly large Doberman but some people seem to love the idea. 

I don't get it, it's not a look that suggests agility or longevity to me.

Same for Shepherds.

I'm lurking in some rough collie groups now and there's less sort of big tough dog stuff but there's ongoing disagreement about how tall and how heavy a Collie should be."
namenerds,ff8oqtr,t3_eryih7,1579689319.0,"Both my husband and I look white.

But they have a very Irish name and are Irish and British descent and Australian. Very very white. And it's Irish but it's not simple ""Kelly"" Irish

I am Jewish and my full unmarried name was Very Jewish in a very recognisable way - think Shoshana Greenberg. It isn't but it's not far off.

Changing my name to my husband's in the abstract didn't bother me. But changing my perceived ethnicity was really weird and jarring.

First of all Shoshana McGillicuddy (not real name) is INTENSELY googlable as in I'm the only one. Sorry if there's a real Shoshana McGillicuddy out there.

Second of all each ethnicity doesn't know what to do with the other name. Like they give up.

Thirdly I as a teen did a thing very like your nickname thing. But it was just to be easy to say. I never tried to pass and I'm not embarrassed by my faith or background. ""Annie Greenberg"" wasn't a name that concealed. ""Annie McGillicuddy"" does. And that makes things weird. I sometimes hear stuff about Jews I doubt I would under my maiden name. People say shit in front of me.

I used to get openly hateful things occasionally. I don't anymore. But it's if anything weirder. 

I occasionally get sideways comments about trying to pass now. I'm not. It would have been fine if I married a Horowitz. 

If it was a simple Jewish name and a simple Irish name and just Leah Kelly that would be okay but they are individually a bit weird and really magical together, lol."

I would just pick one and see how they go with it and probably not bother with the other one if they have an adverse reaction.

My temptation if starting all over  to find out baselines would be a regular kibble brand like Purina. If they don't react that's money that can go on other things."

There are things that I've seen recommended as far as fish oil, or anti-anxiety meds or exercise. I'm not saying to exercise your particular arthritic dog.

It may be related to the episode not being able to walk or it may be separate. Honestly it may have been a seizure or stroke.

If he's basically sleeping all day and spending the night fearful about nothing because his mind is going I would have a think about quality of life. 

But it may be worth investigating something to take the edge off if he still seems to be enjoying time with you every day.

I wouldn't rely on this vet for end of life recommendations if they haven't even flagged declining neurological health. Just my opinion."
dogs,fddgwk6,t3_ekqusg,1578311756.0,"You shouldn't be leaving a six year old unsupervised with a dog. It is an unfair and unsafe expectation on a child that age and on the dog.

The six year old cannot calibrate herself. No six year old has perfect judgement about what dogs find stressful or painful or scary. The dog's job is not to just absorb discomfort or pain because the kid doesn't know better. A dog will eventually correct a child as it would a puppy - by snapping and biting it.

Its happened three times and your kid hasn't been seriously injured - this is not a vicious dog that wants to do harm. However, serious harm could still occur. The first time should have been a wake-up call.

There's no special reason this is difficult to correct or likely to progress. Just supervise them. Honestly someone on hand to head off problems will probably be a massive relief to the dog."
dogs,fdcdgyw,t3_ekiy42,1578272225.0,"The flat ""dogs shouldn't be aggressive to people"" makes no sense to me.

But there's protective behaviour and there's just poor control, and/or fearfulness, and/or resource guarding, and those are not useful and things I would encourage.

I don't especially want my dog to be excessively friendly or biddable by randoms though. I have had great experiences with a dog being just the right level of protective and them being unfriendly prevented a worse situation. But the same dog was not consistently unpleasant or erratic with all strangers."

I would not trust any malicious little spitz (I actually like them this is affectionate) around guinea pigs. Guinea pigs are so delicate and have little birdie feet and make delicious noises, it's not comparable to like a cat or so something more able to look after itself. Most spitzes have at least a bit of prey drive and are kinda spunky and stubborn which is a lot of fun but not fair to a guinea pig that's easily lethally harmed."
dogs,fcj9h05,t3_ehfifl,1577680600.0,"Flinching and cowering and crying can be just poorly socialised submission. It doesn't mean she was necessarily actively abused.

The ears and eyes can be more neglect than abuse. Tons of dogs in the pound here, especially with upright ears, have no or wrecked ear tips. It's sun damage and flybite. Looks dreadful. Not a sign of GOOD ownership but not abuse per se.

The eye thing just sounds like something wrong with her eye.

Many dogs don't like being cuddled too much and find it scary.

Honestly there's nothing here that definitely yes she was abused but really the treatment is the same anyway - calm consistency and structure.

Some people sort of build up an abuse backstory for every pound dog - it's not wholly true. But really it all comes to the same.

Many huskies are a bit fearful/weird and tons with shit previous owners have poor socialisation and neglect issues. It doesn't mean they were necessarily going after her to abuse her, they might have just not given her the attention she needed.

Thank you for looking after her. I would try to move forward."
dogs,fcj8d33,t3_ehcuwb,1577679846.0,"Honestly those dogs don't look in bad condition. I've seen rescues with worse circumstances.

I think it's sad she wasn't able to reach out to her breed community and help place most of them and keep a couple. 

I would be cautious of pillorying her for having healthy dogs and a dirty house, if that is the situation.

It seems like the sort of situation where supporting her to be okay with fewer dogs may not have been as appealing to someone as placing 50 appealing little dogs with a sad backstory at an adoption fee of hundreds a pop. 

Idk maybe I have a suspicious mind."
dogs,fchrho1,t3_eh5rxu,1577653325.0,"The most silent breeds I have experience with are difficult in other ways and do not in personality or physique resemble any of the breeds you list.

Akitas hardly bark at all in my experience and I've had two and met more. Their barks when they do are also not high pitched. Chows are also not very vocal. I've met fewer Shar Peis but they seem similar.

But the thing is these are big, stubborn, powerful dogs that require experience and an owner who can project quiet strength. They are not happy floppy dogs that love everybody. I'm a big fan but yeah.

I don't think Akitas or Chows fully deserve their mean reputation but they don't suffer fools. And Shar Peis are sometimes bought because they're wrinkly and cute and that can be very unfortunate.

All the ones you are interested in are very different in scale and attitude. I have enjoyed some dachshunds a lot but they bark like devils and can be very high strung. Spaniels brap and yap and carry on, the quietest spaniels I've met are Cavaliers. Schnauzers are spunky vocal terriers. I would not trust any oodle for barking.

But I think someone who gets an Akita or a Chow wanting a Labrador will mess themselves and the dog up. It's not really fair.

Japanese Chins hardly bark I'm told but they are tiny and I'm not personally experienced with them.

Cavaliers are calmer and quieter than cockapoos or Cockers in my experience. I wouldn't say very low barking (compared to my big grumpy breeds) but they are a less vocal happy floppy spaniel breed."

My man would need to be 90 (part of being 90 would be having our decades in where the wasn't decrepit) or have lost his arms for this to be okay. This is fucking nasty and ignorant.

I'm worth a man who wipes his ass, aren't you?

I would have maybe one more conversation articulating ""this feels disrespectful. Whether or not you mean it like this, it feels like you're saying I'm not worth you showering and taking care of yourself."" 

It sounds genuinely miserable to otherwise spend years with a man who literally needs to be told to wipe his ass, and who is stinking out the house. Getting asked to blow him? Running a hospice/escort service for the terminally lazy is not good for you.

A man who physically can't stop shitting his pants can at least shower daily and do his own laundry.

I know it's separate background but it will be confused with Amelia a lot and probable spelt Amelia, Emelia, etc. To me the classic, straightforward, no explanations name is Emily. Which I still really like and would classify up there with the timeless evergreen names. But you have to be at peace with it not being uncommon.

Anneliese is far less common, more of a vintage pick. Of the two it's more distinctive because it's less in style as far as vowel-y sounds - Emilia, Amelia, Eliana, Ariana, etc all sort of flow the same though they aren't interchangeable.   


Personally I find Annika, Annabel, or Lisette more attractive. That could just be me though. I would worry about potential issues with ""anal"" but Anneliese is the name I'd pick of these two I think."

First for Girl:

Roslyn - I dislike -lyn. I like a lot of Ros- names but Roslyn looks odd and I would prefer Rosemary, Rosamund, Rosalba, etc. Or just Rose, with a longer middle. 

Anne Marie - I don't mind Annabel and I like Marie by itself as a first name you hardly ever hear on babies but I don't like Anne or Anna alone and I don't like Anne Marie.

Lorelei - Pretty. I love this one. 

Adelaide - Don't like it. Do like Ada. Adelaide is not a pleasant sound.

Estelle - It's not bad but I would prefer Esther.

Laurel - I like it a lot.

Elena - I don't  like it.

Alana - I love it.

Clara - I dislike it. I like Clare though.

Aurelia - Aurora would be simpler and more appealing to me but Aurelia is a nice name.

Middle name:

Bay - Nice, but I love Blythe more.

Rey - I like it a lot but would probably spell it Rae or Rei.

Jane - A little predictable as a middle, more unusual as a first, but a name I really love.

Mae - Really love it.

Grace - I find this incredibly dull as a middle. However, Gwen would be the same initial and less common, and Faith would be a less common virtue name.

Ivy - I really love it.

Leigh - this spelling kills it for me but I'm fond of Lee, Lisette (lee-zet) and Lilou (lee-lo). I know Leigh and Lea are used as spellings for girls but to me Lee is simplest and best-looking. The -gh is just ugh."

But I would not be keen on a pointer/Aussie pup because neither breed has a temperament I find especially compatible with my own. 

Some perfectly good breeds exist that make some people very happy but wouldn't suit me. Aussies are very over popular at the moment and I prefer other herding breeds. Pointers I've met are strong-willed, high energy, and difficult to keep contained.

namenerds,fc4wcbz,t3_eg5gsi,1577431127.0,"I don't especially like Stella as a name but Stellamaris is striking. I would say Stella MAHR-iss. Almost Stella-Morris honestly. To me the meaning is lovely (I'm not even Catholic) and it feels elaborate but not smushed. Like Dorothea or Leora.

Stellamarie is fine but feels more like Annabeth - visibly two names smushed. Just a different vibe. Also vaguely suggestive of Stellaluna the cartoon bat, which doesn't bother me but may bother you.

I think using all of Stellamaris together is the best way to keep Maris used rather than shunted off to a middle name. 

Stella Marie is however certainly a pleasant name that wouldn't be painful to live with. It's just of the two I find Marie the more interesting first name. I like Marie Celeste and Marie Soleil for myself but really can't justify them."

Finding caring for it fulfilling as the carer or feeling sad about it being put down would be selfish reasons to keep it alive.
