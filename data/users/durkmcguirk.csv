I was actually just thinking about this when I read your post. Sometimes signs can be thrown our way, from some sort of unknown force, I guess. Strange that I read this now, because I haven't really cried about him in a while.

Also, you say you're 18 and you ""still live with your parents"" as if that's something to be ashamed of! You've only been out of high school for what, a year?

Anyway I just want to tell you that the opiate path will make you feel better for maybe the first year, then it will eventually take everything away from you, and you'll be lucky to get out alive. I heard it from everyone and didn't listen either.

The main thing is that it wastes time. I've been clean for 9 months now, I'm 24, I take kratom to cope, and I still feel the shivers. It has seriously and severely slowed down my progress in life. Although I thought I wanted to die, opiates made me feel better long enough to want to live. Now I'm older and I have nothing. I actually have something to be embarassed about when I say ""I still live with my parents.""

Opiates will waste time because you will run out of money and never be able to buy anything important, and you will spend a LOT of time withdrawing. The longer you do it the worse you withdraw. I can't tell you what to do, but I would recommend you try and cut this shit out fast before it becomes a major problem. I would actually suggest trying to find good friends or a girlfriend/boyfriend, but I know that's easier said than done.

I really started to get better when I started living for myself. Try to do more nice things for yourself. I don't think you want the pain of opiod dependence. It's a whole lot of pain, and it's not even a cool type of pain, like from working out or being in the military. I have nothing to show for all my time wasted, except for maybe stories that get dimmer by the year."

Hold out as long as you can with heroin withdrawal. Once you are on your first day and *fully* withdrawing, take 9 grams of Red Bali or Maeng Da kratom. You will almost want to cry because of the relief. But it's still going to be very hard.

The reason I say to wait until you're fully withdrawing isn't for any medical reason, just that you will appreciate it that much more. But don't get your hopes too high, it doesn't get you high or anything. I don't want to hype it up too much.

Writing this has been therapeutic. I felt the void inside of me close up, just a little. I didn't even take my dose of kratom at 3:30 like I wrote above. It's now 4:30 so that's nice I got to delay it by an hour. I have being addicted to kratom. I seriously wonder if things would even improve that much if I stopped taking it.

Day 2 with Red Borneo kratom. I need to make it at least one more day with this single oz packet, to know that I'm taking no more than 9 grams a day. 9 g's is still kind of a lot, but I think it's manageable, and everything after that will get progressively easier. Once I get down to 5 grams a day or so, I can just quit.

Day 4 with same Red Borneo pack. I ran out on my first dose at 2:00 AM. It's technically Day 5, because at the very end of the night before Day 1 I opened this packet. That means that I think I got my use down to 8 grams a day! So it probably went like this

&#x200B;

Day 0 (day before day 1)

&#x200B;

1 - Last dose of the day before sleeping - 3 grams

2 - Day 1 - 7 grams

4 - Day 3 - 7 grams

5 - Day 4 (so far) - 3 grams

So really I was wrong, it was probably closer o 7 grams each day. That's amazing! I was at 15 per day not long ago. 

&#x200B;

Ok, actually an ounce has 28.3 grams. Close enough though. The differences are miniscule. Basically 7-8 grams a day. Very good improvement I think, unless the guy that packaged this one put in a little extra.

quittingkratom,ff4cx3c,t3_erkq7v,1579560654.0,"So I recently 'let my guard down' and upped my dosage again, currently dealing with that, so I may not be one to talk, but when I have been successful in my tapering, this is what I did:

Keep a journal around. I spend a lot of time on my computer, so I actually opened up notepad for this. It actually started with me typing out a sort of diary entry, about how much I hate kratom. You know when you have those moments of clarity? It was like that, and I just laid out all the reasons why this is ruining my life and how badly I wanted to quit.

Then, I started building a loose schedule. The first rule of thumb in my opinion is to wait no less than four hours between doses. Take whatever you are comfortable with, then write down the time and dosage amount. 

So for example, 10:00 AM - 5 gs. Then YOU MUST WAIT until at least 2:00 pm before dosing again. If you're like me, and super addicted, then this will actually lower your tolerance just by having this break. You want to document every dose you take and then you will find it fairly easy to lower your dosage at your own pace.

Have I cheated my dosages? Hell yeah, but it all depends on how determined I was at the time. Starting out, the first couple weeks are rough. But then once you get into the groove, you find that you actually feel BETTER when you space out your doses.

I did get my usage down to almost 5 gs a day, some days even less. But for whatever reason I screwed up, and I'm back at 9 gpd. Looking at my journals, I didn't even write down the gram amount at first. That wasn't until later. Something as simple as just writing down when you take your doses really puts things into perspective. I'm going to copy and paste some of what I did."
