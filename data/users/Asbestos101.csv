boardgames,ffbj3vj,t3_esd9ua,1579767687.0,"So, I played a game a while back called **Vineta**. It was a weird little island sinking game where everyone was trying to protect their favourite colour of houses whilst the island got stripped away.

I didn't like that game, because it felt really punitive and hard to control, and it felt like the majority of what you did at the beginning of the game didn't matter. And as soon as it became clear what your colour was you became THE target because everyone knew that was a safe colour to target and wouldn't give anything away about their own identity.

Has anyone played both, and if so, does WoW avoid this satisfactorily?"
boardgames,ff9qa35,t1_ff9mio1,1579718580.0,I think ultimately Matt and Quinn's are building legitimacy in the new blood by including them in reviews so that long term they will be able to step back from the site without it collapsing without them.

Too fucking right. I've struggled through 4 games of it, and I can't see the appeal. The emphasis all seems to be in weird places in that game, and the card mechanics are so unwieldly it feels like a constant struggle to get anything to happen."

genesysrpg,ff8ibp5,t1_ff7q93v,1579679796.0,"This is nice, I like this. It's a form of niche protection too.

I really like the idea that a player becomes proficient in one spell type, and then they find creative ways to use that one thing."
genesysrpg,ff5n2sg,t3_ern4sd,1579601153.0,"I like the idea of a world that is the complete opposite , where a form of magic is accessible to most people a la Harry potter or Naruto , except you have to train at any one magic type to be proficient in it. Not entirely sure how you'd balance learning one spell type at a time, maybe as ranked talents rather than breaking out every spell into a skill?"
boardgames,ff2pov2,t1_ff0qgdr,1579518220.0,"The only difference is that it's possible to deduce additional information if players are sloppy. If I show you a 7 of spades in one round, then I show you a 9 of clubs in another round, and i've only got 2 cards left, you now know i've got two 'roses'. Whereas with properly identical rose cards you'd only know that i'd shown you a rose card both rounds.

It can be mitigated with careful play, but you have to realise it's a thing."
avorion,ff2kwbg,t3_epy69d,1579510893.0,"So, in terms of user facing experience this is a big one. This is basically a form of graphical overhaul for the entire game. The game is getting a huge beautification pass. I love this.

I know it's a polish item, but i'd love to see the faction naming generation get a bit of a sensibility pass. It would help to build a sense of identity between the factions if they have more memetic names.

Or how about thinking that in archipelago that everyone takes turns placing their action disks, and then removes them in order to actually resolve the actions. This misunderstanding came from a bit of a SUSD review where they said 'here's what taking actions looked like' and for some reason that never detached from my brain.

After the first painful game I realised the mistake- put a disk down and do the thing, not the massively convoluted mess we were doing before."

As soon as your partner told you how much she valued a space, she was giving you the game. She should have kept that as secretive as possible, even with misdirection plays.

Additionally, one shouldn't rely on their opponent making mistakes to be the crux of your strategy. If you'd noticed that the location was good for her to build in even if she didn't outright say it, then she would have lost anyway if she hadn't made a plan to displace you."
