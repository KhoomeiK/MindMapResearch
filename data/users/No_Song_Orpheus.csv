Either way, In my most objective opinion I feel it was a penalty regardless of how it was defined.  He had him out of bounds but continued to spin and throw him down.  If it was a linebacker doing that to Lamar the call is made every time.

That is why even if they were wrong about the technicalities I don't believe it is a call we can complain about.  

Unnecessary from the Llama in the heat of the moment."

There is no direct evidence but the amount of connections is so wide and thorough that yes I believe it.

That there is a kill room in the basement where kids are taken for Satanic sacrifice? Doubtful.

Was there a false flag PR campaign inflating the claims to make it seem ridiculous? Probably.

The mainstream media made labelled Pizzagate as a conspiracy theory to make it seem crazy. In reality, it was just the first breadcrumb that kept coming up with connections throughout Politics, Hollywood, the Clinton Foundation.  They have been talking about Epstein, Clinton, Trump, Prince Andrew for years now as part of it and look how that ended up."
