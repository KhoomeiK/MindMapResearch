Why support Trump? He hasn’t made life better for Canadians and has been proved to be a crook? Why care if an American president, especially the most corrupt one ever, is cut out of a tv broadcast?

metacanada,fc3s2s9,t1_fc3roac,1577397199.0,"Of course, but calling cutting a 5 second trump scene out of a movie that was made 20+ years ago â€˜government funded arbitrary censorshipâ€™ is ridiculous in my opinion. Again, this isnâ€™t the hill to die on. It will push reasonable people away from your argument. 

Why support Trump? He hasnâ€™t made life better for Canadians and has been proved to be a crook? Why care if an American president, especially the most corrupt one ever, is cut out of a tv broadcast? If you have to react to the extremes on anything that happens it doesnâ€™t really bring weight to your argument. 

You can do better is all Iâ€™m saying."
metacanada,fc3pwvf,t1_fc3pmyz,1577395685.0,"Even if they were, and we have proved that isnâ€™t the case, why waste your time? There are much bigger fish to fry. We are making fun of you guys for it. 

To be honest if this is your reaction Iâ€™m sure you appalled at the Alberta governments energy war room right? Thatâ€™s literally government paid propaganda with no oversight. If you are against this you have to be against that.

Iâ€™m trying to find middle ground here."
JustBootThings,fc3nzgm,t1_fc3j5mz,1577394290.0,You should write about the therapist part. It would help a lot of people.
metacanada,fc3n4bn,t1_fc3md49,1577393673.0,"They did it in 2015 and it was because it was a meaningless scene that was cut to have more room for commercials. I thought people here were about the free market. Too bad facts have liberal bias. 

Also, youâ€™re getting butt hurt about home alone. This makes you look stupid. Grow up. Rationality is understanding which hill to die on."

metacanada,fc39v6b,t1_fc34q8s,1577384973.0,Nah they just think idiots like you are going to ruin it. Youâ€™re getting triggered about somebody getting cut from a broadcast.

worldpolitics,fc39ko6,t1_fc0dqsv,1577384768.0,Youâ€™re a bootlicker. Itâ€™s not ok for anybody to be in this situation. What would you do if your kids were in a place like this?
