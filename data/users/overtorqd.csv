ProgrammerHumor,felocy1,t1_fekr2uu,1579226992.0,You don't have a code reviewer?
wholesomememes,felo856,t3_epk2ka,1579226902.0,"I'll just say this works even for us that actually had what we needed when we were younger. I had great role models and now I get to try to emulate maybe even improve in that. If my wife and I can give my kids what I had, I will die a proud man. We're doing ok so far."
bourbon,fdlj3h1,t1_fdk7f3l,1578525137.0,Wow. I tried this a couple weeks ago and loved it. I would pay $40 or so for another bottle if I saw it near me.
wholesomememes,fdlif0e,t1_fdlek8p,1578524703.0,Had to cut it off so he didn't wake her.
spaceporn,fcl7www,t3_ehkuy1,1577741735.0,I want to go to there.
wholesomememes,fc5gwl3,t1_fc4lm1k,1577457262.0,"You're right, seeing them all together is more insightful and relatable. It's still kind of sad to me because I value the human relationships and interactions in my life so much it's hard for me to see people who can't experience that. But having a cat as a best friend is better than feeling like you're always alone.

wholesomememes,fc45chj,t3_efylki,1577407045.0,This is kinda sad.
ProgrammerHumor,fc42r6s,t3_eftj9g,1577405100.0,"Ok, this is hilarious. Sure, it's not what any productive shop looks like and we should all appreciate and look forward to a quality code review. But it's still hilarious."
woodworking,fc09ifa,t1_fbzdz9d,1577284001.0,"It's hard when you don't have the right tool for the job. A palm sander won't usually remove enough material to get rid of a wobble. An inexpensive tool that would help flattening a board is a hand plane. If you're willing to put in some time sharpening the iron, you can often find these at garage sales or eBay for cheap. And they take up almost no space."
woodworking,fbzcca7,t3_efamx5,1577241988.0,"It looks great, congratulations! Why did it take 6 months to make? What kind of tools do you have?"
woodworking,fbzb66c,t3_efakdh,1577240874.0,"I'd be proud of that sapele and maple one if I made it. Well done! My oldest is 6 and I really want to do a project with him, but I feel like I'm limited to hammer and nails. He can sand and maybe glue up, but he's too young for anything sharp..."
BeAmazed,fbz6o1v,t3_ef6gfr,1577236738.0,It doesn't work with all boxes.
