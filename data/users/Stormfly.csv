AskMen,ffwckux,t1_ffwc6ag,1580295421.0,"But this was about knowing gun owners.

Your point about not mentioning it is a good one, as I said myself that I don't know which I'd be classified as, and my friends probably wouldn't have thought our family had a gun.

But most people I know don't have guns. The only people I know that have them are farmers.

So if I lived in a city and knew no farmers, I wouldn't know many people who had guns. If I lived in the countryside and knew farmers, I'd know a lot of people with guns.

That's all I was saying.

It's very easy to stay within your social group and not interact much with people from different groups. Even without trying."
AskMen,ffwc1q5,t1_ffw0izr,1580294706.0,"You completely missed my point.

The rural areas might have a higher % of gun ownership, but because of the population disparity, that still doesn't mean that many people actually have guns.

Also, I personally wouldn't consider it a right, but I'm not American. At least not without a license. 

The article brings up a good point though. I don't own a gun but technically I lived in a house with somebody who did, as my father inherited one from his father. I'm not sure where I'd fall in those demographics.

I forget we owned a gun because it was always locked up and was taken out less than a handful of times I can remember (Only to be maintained or checked by police. It was never fired)"
AskMen,ffvxpsz,t1_ffux9wv,1580276513.0,"I'd also disagree that it's most.

I'd say that most men have struggled at some point, but I wouldn't say most men are currently struggling.

There's a large % in a relationship and not everybody in a relationship is struggling to get in one. I'm single but I wouldn't say I'm struggling to get a girl. 20% of the men probably do 80% of the struggling.

Reddit has huge selection bias again, and especially this sub, as there are a huge number of people here that like to blame their problems on other people, and often act like dating as a man is incredibly difficult for everybody and is easy for women."
AskMen,ffvxhx4,t1_ffva90q,1580276309.0,"> If you live in certain areas you might know very few people with guns. But if you live in somewhere more than a few dozen miles from the city? It's probably hard to know someone who doesn't own guns.

But this doesn't contradict what they are saying?

Look at population distribution. In a city of 12 million, a very small % would own guns. Let's say 1%. That's 120,000 people.

Now we go to a rural area where 100% of people own guns, but the population is probably lower. Maybe 20,000 people.

The point stands. People will think that more Americans have guns because there are areas where everybody has guns, even though those are a smaller fraction of the population."
40kLore,ffvx4wi,t1_ffvq59r,1580275974.0,"I also said ""a good half of the time"" in the first comment. Most is vague. I just meant that the TT is more accurate more often than it's not.

I mentioned other editions as a disclaimer on how things change, not that I was backtracking. People have been saying that the tabletop is unbalanced for a number of editions.

Space Marines are T4, while marines are T3. You could argue that this shows how they are tougher. The bands aren't neatly defined as to what constitutes what S4 and T4 mean exactly, and wounds are a mostly abstract way of dealing with things.

In the lore you'll see Marines going down from a single shot, so there's no major reason for them to have 2 wounds. Only Primaris have a lore reason to be able to get back up.

I'm not saying tabletop is exact, but I'm saying that the lore is mostly based off of tabletop, so I don't think it's as far off as people think. You could always argue that the lore is just the TT with some really lucky rolls in many cases. 

I'm mostly just sick of the baseless claims that the TT makes no sense when there are plenty of cases where the lore contradicts lore, so there's no actual base for what the ""truth"" is much of the time.

As far as I can tell, except for some exceptions that are obviously done for balance reasons, the TT rules most closely matches the lore established in rulebooks, which I would consider to be the baseline."
40kLore,ffvm777,t1_fftzfi9,1580267410.0,"I said it's more accurate about half the time.

That's obviously a case where it's not.

When it comes down to baseline units I think it's not far off. Obviously there are many decisions made for game balance reasons like I said. That's one of them.

In previous editions the balance was different."

40kLore,fftgghj,t1_fftdu58,1580219845.0,"Lore is based off of tabletop for most of the things.

It's only special characters that have tabletop rules based off of lore. Sometimes they might rebalance things to make them more in line with what they thought of in their initial design, and there are limits to the system, but most people here don't even have a perfect gauge of the expected power levels of many combatants.

People always talk about how X character should be tougher/harder/better/faster/stronger, but that differs wildly between books. Like you said, there are times when a Space Marine will do ridiculous feats and people think that means that they should be better on tabletop.

Except even in lore, Space Marines are only about as good as 10 other men. That doesn't all translate perfectly to tabletop, as many of those benefits aren't present (like the brain eating and the not sleeping and the tactical knowledge) so they aren't 10 times as good in raw stats.

Admittedly, this does change between editions. A 3+ save was worth much more back when AP didn't just reduce the save. 

An issue is the broad spectrum of stats. A Space Marine is S4, but so is a Catachan. They wanted to make Catachan stand out as being stronger than regular humans, but that moved it into the same range as a Space Marine.

This is an issue and I don't think that TT is *always* accurate, but I do think it's not as far off as people pretend it is. I don't think it's ever really contradicted established lore unless it was a rules oversight.

If you read Dan Abnett, he basically acts like Space Marines have a 6+ save, so if we try to balance for his ""lore"", it won't be the same as if we balanced for other authors."
40kLore,fft70e3,t1_fft0cao,1580210333.0,"I disagree.

TT is more accurate than the novels most of the time. If we just take wounds to mean more than just meat points, and to include a kind of resolve or additional defensive capability, it works.

Like a Captain might be expected to power through a nasty wound because he has the resolve. Like a form of FNP.

Obviously it's somewhat abstracted, as it's there for balance, but I'd say that TT is still more accurate than the fluff a good half of the time.

But I guess it depends on what you consider to be the baseline."

todayilearned,ffqjr69,t1_ffqid9m,1580136509.0,"German is mostly the same as English though, isn't it?

""I speak German"" is ""ich spreche deutsch""

I think they only put it at the end in subordinate clauses, like ""I went to work *when they called*"". It's a special case rather than the standard. I don't speak German though. I've only chatted about it briefly with people who do. I thought it was similar to how French does it when using pronouns. Eg ""Je te vois"" which is like ""I you see"".

So it is different from English, but in Japanese it's the normal case.

Sentence structures can be quite common, but Japanese is mostly based around keeping the verb at the end of the sentence. I think it has something to do with keeping the most specific information towards the end. Like how adjectives come first and they prefer Year/Month/Day."
teachinginkorea,ffqiykr,t1_ffqesc2,1580135895.0,"I found it harder to socialise without alcohol at home than I do here.

Here I've found a few daytime events that I really enjoy, but at home I couldn't really find any. Most events were X length and then they'd go out drinking. At least here they usually go for food afterwards so I don't feel left out.

Obviously depends on where you live, but I feel that issue was actually much smaller here than it was at home. After I finished college, I met very few new people and would mostly just spend time with my friends in one of their houses. When I moved away, I just couldn't find anywhere to make new friends, and that's a large reason I decided to travel so far away.

The fact that many people work evenings and so many people share the same job means you have a lot in common with those people. It's still hard to befriend locals though, for those exact reasons. You work awkward hours and will forever be an ""outsider"". That's probably why I've met a number of people that have lived here for 7+ years and don't really speak the language and mostly mingle with other foreigners.

Some of my friends speak Korean better than me, so they can chat away in Korean, but I can see how the Koreans look when they just can't express what they want to say, or we're talking too fast amongst ourselves and they seem to slowly feel left out.

There have also been times where they've just said they were too tired to speak English and I get that. Especially if there are other Koreans they can speak with.

Most of my friends are other foreigners for this reason. The language barrier is a bit of a hurdle. There are some Koreans I get along well with but don't spend very much time with because socialising with us is a bit more work for them."

The main guess most people have (because an official statement was never given) was that the whole thing was just not selling well, and a large reason for that was that the game was too hard to start up (too much £££) and so they wanted to redesign the game to be easier to play on a smaller scale.

That still doesn't justify destroying everything rather than just having a rules overhaul like 40k, so the other guess is that they felt like the world was the issue, that it stagnated too much and didn't lend itself well to story progression.

Most people agree that the world is really cool, but nothing has happened there and it was probably really hard for them to run campaigns because they had to justify every faction being there and if they wanted to add a new faction they might not be able to.

RPGdesign,ff25fcj,t1_ff1788g,1579494309.0,"How much do you care about the gameplay?

There are many divisions of TTRPGs, with a major one being narrative vs. gameplay. 

D&D would be a more gameplay-focused game, while Dungeon World would be a more narrative-focused game in a similar setting.

I'd recommend taking a look at Dungeon World as it's much simpler than D&D or something, and if you want it to be more about ""playing through a story"" than ""playing a game in that setting"", that might be what you are looking for. D&D is fun, but too many people think that's what all RPGs should be like.

You might not even need to make a whole new system. You could just use the PbtA (Powered by the Apocalypse) system and then tailor the classes/races/enemies to suit your world.

Personally, I really enjoy messing with the system and rules and tailoring it to be exactly what I want, but if you just want to play a game in your setting, I'd recommend you try something like Dungeon World and then just fiddle around with the details until it suits your world/races/magic/etc and then play a game or two.

AskMen,feypzf7,t3_eqvtup,1579449069.0,"While I agree with the others that each person decides for themselves, I do also think that not every person does.

Many people put up with far too much because they don't want to make a deal out of things.

I understand your worries.

Many groups have a punching bag. They have something that makes them an easy target. It's usually all in good fun. Like one guy was on a bad date and we'll tease him about it for a week or so. It often helps people deal with problems like a form of inoculation. We tease you over a flaw so you learn how to deal with your insecurities. 

This often moves around so one person isn't always getting a disproportionate amount of flak, but sometimes it doesn't. Many groups will mix between being mean and being nice but this isn't always the case. Also, sometimes it only makes the insecurities worse. 

I like my friends but they can go too far sometimes and while I can tell them that it's bothering me or that they should stop, many people can't.

Sometimes ""banter"" goes too far and people get hurt. I don't think this is reserved to guys, but I do think it's something that a lot of guys are very dismissive of. 

Sometimes the ""insult you to your face but be there when you need help"" isn't enough. Sometimes it gets to you. A lot of guys lack emotional support and this is a reason why.

Ideally friends should tease you but also be nice and say nice things. My friends tease me but they also pick me up. Or they do nice things in a ""mean"" way (""Nice jacket, *idiot*."")

It's a subtlety that can be missed from the outside, which might be why you are worried and he is not, but it's also a subtlety that can be missed from the inside, which is why your worry is good.

If he's happy, that should be enough.

But you're doing well by making sure he's actually happy and not putting up with it because he doesn't want to rock the boat."

The thing is that as I grew up I started to get much closer with him and I'd realised that he embarrassed me on purpose and I don't hold it against him.

When we were in college, he was the ""cool dad"" and my friends used to like meeting him. Not that he had did anything typically ""cool"" like playing guitar or skydiving, but he and I are so similar that he'd get along with my friends. Even now that I've moved away, my friends still joke about going to my house just to hang with him.

RPGdesign,fewk1t6,t1_fetipqz,1579412296.0,"> I know that's one reason that I went with ""Brawn"" rather than ""Strength"", because it has a broader usage than D&D's Strength attribute. (Adds to your character's toughness etc.) 

I found that renaming things helped with a few things and how stats are seen. I also renamed my ""Physical Strength"" characteristic to ""Brawn"" and I felt it helped because I could make comparatives. I could have ""Brawn"" to be about Physical Strength and ""Knowledge"" to be a Mental Strength. Then I had ""Toughness"" and ""Willpower"" as a Physical and Mental endurance statistics respectively.

Originally it started out with me wanting to make each stat have a different starting letter. S for strength clashed with S for *Social*, and P for perception clashed with my P for *Power*. Although I'm not 100% sure on that last one. I decided to use Cognisance but I'm wondering if another word would suit better.

I used **Cognisance** to be like a ""sensing and understanding"" stat and I'm not sure if that's fully understood. The idea was that it was more of a mental understanding than a *""You have better eyesight/hearing""*. 

I wanted each of the stats to be more about training and personal effort than *""Elves are born with better eyes so they can see better""*. Each race affects stats, but like Shadowrun, it only affects the upper limits of the stat rather than a flat advantage. Dwarfs *can* be tougher, but only if they put in the effort."

If there was a lot of thought put into the sword, I think most people would appreciate it. I don't think most people would hang it up in the front hall or something, but it would be cool to have and show to some people. If it was based on a game/film/book you both love or something else important, like a historic replica, I think it would be cool. 

I've bought my friends some silly gifts and we hang them up in our houses. We appreciate the thought that goes into it.

Some things like that are silly but obviously have sentimental value. If somebody got me a sword, I'd really treasure it and I'd expect people that go to my house would understand that.

CA worries about upsetting the old grumpies, and about losing the others. The issue seems to be that Historical fans, though smaller, might get angry and leave, while the newer Fantasy fans might just drift away but return when the new game comes out.

So they might be trying to extend the duration of WH2 because obviously sales of WH1 dropped hugely after WH2 was released (maybe even after it was announced) and/or they might want to take the time to get it right after the issues with WH2.

Of course, this mostly ignores the large chunk of people that just love Total War games and don't overly care whether they are Fantasy or Historical, and are excited with any release."

If you have friends that invite you out to play sports or a job that requires work, it's easier to stay fit. Or you can hire a trainer. In the end though, it's you that has to do the exercise. You can't make somebody else do it for you.

Sometimes people have issues and feel better because other people in their lives helped them. This is fine.

But if you want to get better, just like if you want to get fit, you need to do the work, and if you don't have somebody that's helping you make it easier, people advise that you just try and do it on your own.
