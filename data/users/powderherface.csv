Ok this is good to know — do you happen to know whether the stiffness of the crinoline makes it less comfortable to sit with (I’ve never worn a dress so it’s a little bit hard to imagine)."

math,ff3se46,t1_ff2rrqh,1579547826.0,"If you're looking for a thorough, rigorous course full of surprises take analysis. A course labelled calculus will probably cover broad topics faster but in less depth, and ultimately won't span as far either. But if you're more interested in getting the maths together to use for something more applied e.g. physics, then calculus may be more appropriate."
analog,ff3s0ir,t3_erek6n,1579547593.0,"Out of interest, did you take the photo with the intention of flipping it?"
AnalogCircleJerk,fek37om,t1_feifmc2,1579191654.0,"Eh I find it hard to compare the photo I linked to one of a UFO not gonna lie, even if just terms of blurriness. In my photo she isn't centred on the horizontal axis though -- she's a little to the right. It's a small amount but significantly alters the photo in my opinion, because it is enough to gear the viewer towards the background rather than our eyes wandering there because the apparent 'subject' is not in focus --  you find the background uninteresting but I find it interesting enough, again that's just taste. 

This being said, I still disagree with this notion that a photo cannot be good if repeats a formula that has been used millions of times before. There are plenty of excellent photographs, by well respected photographers, which fall into popular, even boring formulae. This does not make them bad even though I/you have seen thousands of photos with the same set up. Reiterating what I said, I don't think because something is done a lot that it cannot be done very well. We will have to agree to disagree if you are not on board with that I think.

Back to the photo though, to me the combination of a (presumably deliberate) slightly off-centred woman, high contrast in focus which one would expect to be 'the other way around' and the interesting ideas this brings (what does the person look like? Are they happy, sad, just shy or uncomfortable?), and the rich background, all make this more interesting than 'snapshots in a photo album'."
AnalogCircleJerk,fefcrbf,t1_fef8jp2,1579053501.0,"I described in my reply to the other commenter a little further into the comment thread. ""Typical"" I guess suggests I just haven't seen enough photos to have come across something like this repeatedly, so to me it was interesting/clever. 

One point you make I don't understand though -- you say the girl and horizon are centred (I disagree there, the girl is not centred from what I can see) but that it isn't carefully considered? Aren't the thousands of carefully considered photos where subjects are indeed centred? Also, whether it was an accident or not, to me is not relevant -- I like the picture as a photo, who the photographer is, and what the true context/intention was I am not interested in (but that's me, everyone approaches these things differently)."
movies,fefc4dy,t1_feexbie,1579053085.0,"Yep, I definitely was one of the them! They showed Beth playing with dolls, at home for the entirety of the film (she repeatedly ill of course, but still), the only one to not interact with someone else in a late-teen/adult relationship-ish kind of way, and the actress is noticeably younger. Of course, many real life people fit into that description and are in their 20s, but in the context of the film, meaning in contrast to her sisters, it suggested to me (and as you say, a lot of other people) that she was the youngest."
movies,feex9d2,t1_feefyok,1579043209.0,"Meg > Jo > Beth > Amy. Definitely wasn't clear from a casting point of view, but I guess it doesn't hugely affect the story either way (well, I haven't read the book, so I probably shouldn't say that)."
AnalogCircleJerk,feex07n,t1_fedw2pc,1579043045.0,"Woah from the downvotes it seems having a brief discussion is against the circlejerk attitude. Anyway:

I haven't seen many examples, but maybe I just don't browse enough photography -- willing to accept that. However, yes I think *the use* of a trope can be clever. Just because something has been done a lot, does not mean it cannot be done well. Most of the examples will be bad, but some can be good. And they are clever precisely because they have done something which distinguishes them from the mass of photographs which use the same technique with mediocrity. 

Take double-exposures. They are almost always shit. Like really shit. Following r/analog for a week is enough to see that. However whilst they are mostly bad, a double-exposure (a trope, but the definition you sent) *can* be done well (though, if you ask me to find an example it'll probably take some time for the reason above, but hopefully you know what I mean).

For me: in contrast to the one you link from IG, the photo I mentioned does not look like a photo shoot. It looks like someone was out with their partner, stopped to take a (probably good) picture of them, and then deliberately focused far away. For what reason -- it's not clear, and so the image becomes enigmatic. This is pushed further also by the fact that the 'focus contrast' between the girl and the landscape is huge -- the set up suggests to the audience she is the subject, yet we can barely discern what she looks like. In contrast, the IG misses all of these points completely. The enigma is gone because the reason behind the photographic choice is obvious: I-am-trying-to-be-edgy. It does nothing for the photo, what is behind the model isn't interesting, it's badly framed, it's close enough to her that we've lost the captivating blur from the B&W picture. It's all just taste in the end, but those two, for me, are a good example of the same technique done well vs done badly."

AnalogCircleJerk,fedpr48,t1_fednds1,1579017232.0,How is it a trope? I don’t think I understand your comment. I mean mocking some of the nonsense on r/analog I understand but the photo I linked is a good and clever photograph. How it being on film is relevant in any way I don’t really understand.
AnalogCircleJerk,fedc8kp,t1_fecw26o,1579007337.0,"[This](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dannymcshane/14596523715/) is very deliberately out of focus and works brilliantly in opinion.

movies,fd6hj5q,t1_fd52nh3,1578191110.0,"That is more to do with the fact you have seen it already I think. However frightening a film may be, it's not going to be scary upon re-watch. 

My point though, is that the elements which make a film frightening are usually not the elements that make a film R-rated? I don't live in the US so might be wrong, but in Europe you'd get a higher age rating from additional violence or gore, and perhaps sex/drugs/swearing as well, which to me aren't elements that contribute to scare factor. So PG-13 or R doesn't seem hugely relevant if we're talking about how scary it is."

movies,fc495xb,t1_fc2t245,1577410012.0,"Personally I was sort of glad they did it that way -- I was afraid it would otherwise turn into an Amadeus-type moment, as most character-dies-in-bed scenes are handled that way. Here the death is confined to the family -- Jo, her mother etc. The audience is prevented from intruding, watching, witnessing this crucial moment for the characters, and so it becomes more about the effect of Beth's death on them than its effect on us."
movies,fc487t4,t3_ef4z7u,1577409264.0,Loved it! Am I the only one who hadn't read the book and came out thinking Beth was the youngest of the four though?
bipolar2,fb7ejgr,t3_ebrtxm,1576587373.0,Hmmm I think this is a little unfair because it is too case-dependent to make a claim like that. I am sure there are thousands/millions of cases where unipolar depression is just as resilient/stubborn as our moods are.
