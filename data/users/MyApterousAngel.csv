KidsAreFuckingStupid,ff8juzn,t1_ff8jsdy,1579681897.0,Fuuuuuck no. Memes have become retards repeating the same shit jokes in different contexts. It was actually an interesting idea when Dawkins came up with it but the spergnet mutated it into something worthless.
MurderedByWords,ff8js0y,t3_es95nw,1579681782.0,There's no murder here without context. Just a whiney cunt replying to a passive aggressive cunt.
