budapest,ff6iemu,t3_erte94,1579627863.0,"Check the train and bus connections. If you have only the weekend (meaning only Saturday and Sunday) you could take a late bus/train Friday or early bus/train Saturday. And go back late Sunday, I did that when I went to Brno. It's not a lake but it's a smaller city than Budapest. Other destinations could be Transilvania (there is a new train connection), the return journey if bought in advance can be only 30 EUR. 

If you absolutely want a roadtrip I don't think just two days is worth it. Too much of a hassle to drive ""so far"" and back."
