I'm sure that Cura advice makes a lot of sense in some particular case because of die swell or shrinkage or something but those sort of factors vary between materials and I've never needed to do that. Try it equal-to and wider than your nozzle and see how it goes. I usually go as wide as possible (which varies per nozzle - it's the diameter of the flat around around the opening)."

prusa3d,fdlsi8x,t3_em1y6j,1578531449.0,"I recently struggled with endstops on my upgrade to MK2.5. 

On the Y axis (bed moving), it turned out the end of the Y belt - the inch or so hanging off the end - had turned over and was preventing the bed from making it all the way to the endstop. 

On the X axis, the fan wire on the side was not tucked into the channel in the printed pieces and that was preventing the X carriage from making it all the way to the endstop.

You should listen very closely and see if the bed/carriage are actually hitting the endstop. You should hear a distinct click if they do.  If you \*do\* hear this click, either the endstop is toast (unlikely, IMO) or it's not hooked up to the electronics correctly.

If you \*don't\* hear this click, you need to look very closely at the mechanism and figure out why the bed or carriage is not making it all the way to the switch. Don't do the homing thing - power it off and carefully move stuff with your hand."

If you decide against that, I'm not sure it really matters which IDE you use. Eclipse will certainly work but if you're just doing REST stuff and can use the Dev Console to do queries/logs, use whatever you're familiar with.
