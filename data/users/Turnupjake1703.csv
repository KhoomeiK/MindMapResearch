depression,ffhd20o,t1_ffhcvzl,1579930416.0,I would definitely choose trying to get back to that mindset with the added experience. I enjoyed every second we spent together
depression,ffhbddd,t3_etm7vi,1579928742.0,"You are one tough kid. That’s a lot of emotions to process at such a young age.  I don’t think you’re broken, you’ve been through a lot. I’m not a therapist but in my opinion the memories we shared with our loved ones make us who we are. You don’t have to let go of the memories of your brother if you don’t want to. My advice (although it may not be very good) would be to keep trying the therapy and be very open about your feelings and thoughts.  Every detail could help the therapist help you. I know you said therapy didn’t work for you but the next session could be the beginning of figuring out how to process/deal with your emotions. 


When my father was diagnosed with a mental illness the doctor put him on several medications that messed with his thoughts. He attempted suicide by cutting an artery to try and make himself bleed out. He cried for help from the bathroom before he bled out and we were able to get an ambulance to the house in time to save his life.   I think he cried out for help because he didn’t want to leave his 4 boys without a father. I’m not a religious person and I don’t know if you are either but after my dad recovered he found faith in religion and was even baptized in the ocean. He’s been the happiest I’ve ever seen him and I couldn’t be happier. 


Stay strong and push forward. You’re a strong kid and I sincerely hope you find what you’re looking for"
