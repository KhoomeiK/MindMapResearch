The cleanser and moisturiser on [this](https://www.avene.com.au/face/specific-care/intolerant-skin) page would probably work well.

I think Priceline has a skincare sale starting tomorrow, so that would be a good place to go look. You could ask for some samples and try them first. If they donâ€™t sting or hurt your psoriasis then you could buy them before the sale is up.

To begin with I would keep the routine simple. Wash face with water in the morning and apply sunscreen ([this](https://www.priceline.com.au/brand/cancer-council/cancer-council-face-body-moisturiser-spf50-invisible-150-ml) is a good one. Itâ€™s sold at Woolies, Coles, Priceline, and Chemist Warehouse so look for whoever has it on sale).

At night, cleanse, then moisturise.

Thatâ€™s it. If you so too many things at once then you may aggravate your psoriasis."

If you buy a [cuticle remover](https://www.amazon.com/Sally-Hansen-Instant-Cuticle-Remover/dp/B0046MK34G) it will remove the skin stuck to your nail where it grows.
