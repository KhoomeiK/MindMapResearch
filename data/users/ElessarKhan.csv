Overwatch,ff4eva5,t1_ff4clon,1579561943.0,"That's why I said there's exceptions. ""Overwatch is a highly nuanced game."" It's hard to make definitive rules in Overwatch. What you just described makes perfect sense in most situations. You are kind of forcing your supports to heal you for damage you took by choice but, you have armor and a brain. You can use these things in combination to ensure that you only employ this tactic in situations where a little neglect from the supports won't kill you. 

I was trying to call out the players who dont have brains or attempt similar tactics without the grace of armor/shields as dps heroes. I may have cast too wide a net. I should have talked about how face tanking is viable in certain situations but almost never if you don't still have armor or shields hp. Like how rein has to facetank to hit swing his hammer but there's limits as to how much help you can expect from your team in doing this."

Overwatch,ff3t3xa,t1_ff3g6d2,1579548270.0,"Sometimes, as support, it's hard to make the call on whether you can save a teammate between fights.

 So many times I see my tank is a shitty position and think, ""if I start healing him from afar, he can totally turn and regroup with me and then we'll group with the team!"" So you start healing him and he just stays fighting right where he is. You can even call out, ""rein, turn and run back to choke, I got you!"" And so at most he might slowly backpedal away from the enemy. Though usually he takes your heals and tries to push further in towards his doom. He dies and suddenly your position is exposed. You die and now there are 4 of your teammates where you stood. 

Internal screaming intensifies."
Overwatch,ff3sd9a,t1_ff3cvbz,1579547813.0,"I respectfully disagree with you. I think this is a ""losing mentality."" No matter how shitty your team is, you have to always beleive victory is possible. And the first fight is often the hardest in matchmaking. If your tank doesnt scout for you, you have to take blind risks or scout as a dps/support.

Your team can be shit and win. You just have to be less shit than the enemy team at the right time. Carrying a shit team can be done too, and not just by killing 4-6 enemies a fight. 

Overwatch is a highly nuanced game, with tons of ""rules,"" and even more exceptions to them. I've won games in which my team only takes, at best, 5v6 fights because one of our teammates does nothing but die. Games where my team has said, ""gg go next,"" and games with flame wars between teammates are winnable. And if you let your teammates make you think otherwise, your competitve mentality isn't strong enough to climb. 

Victory is always possible not matter how slim the odds but, only when one makes an active effort to achieve it. Not that I think you throw or stop trying in any of your games. I just am worried that you and players like you have an easily tilted mentality that holds you back in already disadvantaged games."
RedDeadOnline,fekpfxj,t1_fejogwl,1579204879.0,Yeah you do.
fireemblem,fekop79,t1_fek3rts,1579204441.0,"Idk if it's just a visual thing for competitive players. Sword heroes brought on huge controversy in melee for having disjointed hitboxes (you can hit with the sword but the sword can not be hit). Not sure if that's still the case though, I dont follow the smash tourney scene closely anymore."
RedDeadOnline,fekmke7,t1_fekgkk2,1579203170.0,"Yeah. You can still use free aim but you're gonna get shit on by long range weapon controller users. I made a post about this once on this sub and got downvoted by salty console peasants. 

The aim assist system in rockstar games is way stronger than any I have ever known. Its borderline aimbot when you change settings to ""wide"" ""strong"" and ""lock on."""

RedDeadOnline,fehgd9e,t1_feh0thp,1579115980.0,What do you mean nothing? I've had no animals in what is regularly a spawn zone but to have no animals on the while map? I've had one bugged lobby with no npc's of any kind but this no animal business is something I havent experienced.
RedDeadOnline,fehg6nl,t1_feh3baj,1579115872.0,"Yeah I've had some trouble, especially when there's lots of players in the area. But this only ravens business is totally foreign to me. I've never failed to fill my hunting wagon with medium and large carcasses. Sometimes I have to go from like west heartlands the eastern half to find a fuckin deer but that's the worst it ever gets for me."
RedDeadOnline,fehftzr,t1_feh25f5,1579115665.0,"On solo lobbies I found that there were no dead zones. But I did not find larger groups of animals. I'm finding it hard to believe that I'm missing a bunch of animals. Any more and it would be close to single player levels, which it never was(I was a ps4 beta tester/player). 

I just wish someone would post some footage of this issue. Its not an easy thing to just clip, I know but there's been a real lack of details when reporting this issue, particularly for the volume of reports."
RedDeadOnline,feheuax,t1_feh46nb,1579115085.0,Are you finding dead areas or a dead enitre map? People are saying they search for hours and find so little. Sometimes I have to go from west heartlands to east but that's about as big as a dead zone ever gets for me.

Personally I love stealing wagons. But I never just kill the horse or blow up the wagon. 

Now if you're attacking and failing to beat the defending posse, I can understand settling for less of a take and destroying the wagon. It's easier to steal some bags than to drive the wagon. But I've had 7 man posses all flinging dynamite or flame bottles at me and my two friends(more specifically at our wagon). 

Those fuckers aren't even trying for the full reward and stopping them is near impossible. Me and my boys are fps veterans, been sniping and shooting on pc for years. We run train on kids in rdo pvp but when 7 guys banzai rush your wagon with... there's no reliable counter play to stop them repeatedly for the whole run. Its not fun. 

Tl;dr Stopping people from destroying a trader wagon is really fuckin hard, plz just try and steal the whole thing, thanks"
unpopularopinion,fchg8rb,t3_egdf6b,1577650220.0,"Uhg this is an important argument but OP is a poor debater. No offense. OP, but I've read most the comments on this thread. You argue well until you start getting emotional. Then you start snapping at people. You're not changing any minds like that. 

So if you wanna argue about why super rich people are usually bad or not, talk to me! I love debates and consider myself to be pretty eloquent.

Here in the USA, the 1% are a huge problem because there is little inhibiting them from using their wealth to influence our political processes. Its been this way for long enough that they are making and removing laws to gain more influence.

They use their influence to divide us on issues that do not matter in order to retain their authority and continue lobbying for legislation that increases their opportunities to further profits, with little to no ethical consideration. 

Example: Its really hard to explain to people that the national debt literally doesnt matter. This nation has been out of debt 1 or 0 times in its history depending on who you ask(this discrepancyis another topic of debate). And that 1 time was less than a decade. That national debt started when we took a loan out from France to beat the British in our Revolutionary War. We make payments every year but have never truly meant to get rid of it entirely because there is no point. At this point in history most the debt, through many complex processes, has been transferred to China. And they aren't holding a gun to our head demanding we pay up in full by sundown. They're happy to have a little extra capital in their coffers from the USA every year. So then, if the debt really doesnt matter, why do politicians spend so much time debating it? Well one, because voters think it matters and two, to divide and confuse. When conservatives are getting railed for not investing in xy or z they can use the national debt as an excuse. Democrats do the same, ofcourse but usually with other non issues.

Most people who disagree and side with the wealthy in these debates haven't studied American history closely enough, especially our legislative history. Consider internal affairs during Teddy Roosevelt's presidency and the years before it. Corporations had near unrestricted rights and were literally poisoning our people, landscape and waterways for extra cash. I'm talking unlimited pouring of wastes into rivers, fields of rotting cattle, rats and feces in your meats, mass burning of tires, the list goes on. They only don't do that now because it is illegal. They don't abstain out of any ethical concerns (though I'm sure at least a handful of them might care for the planets future). I'm sure of this because corporations still do lots of awful things in places where the laws dont stop them. Nestle and coke are stealing entire water sources from countries with no laws or a weaker justice system. They hire PMC's to protect these operations else the locals would likely kill everyone out of self defense. 

Why are corporations/businesses like this? Because American Capitalism considers anything less than constant growth to be failure. So even when you are the owner of the wealthiest corporation in the world you still are looking for more ways to grow. Sustain is never the goal. If a billion dollar business is still only worth a billion dollars by next year, it is considered to be failing. If this fact alone doesn't bother you consider this: hospitals are businesses in America. And everything I've said about businesses and their owners applies to them too. They are not satisfied with providing a necessary service to the community. They want profits. And no, profit does not always mean pleasing the consumer. Else America would be a very happy place.

I promise not to be so long winded with my responses! I feel like I should have just made my own post but, I'm not sure how controversial this opinion is. 

P.S. Vote for Bernie"
unpopularopinion,fch1a45,t1_fakuytz,1577646265.0,Source your stats. Sorry this thread is old but god damn would this mean something if its true. But before I make a judgement I gotta look into that 20% stat and how they got it.
