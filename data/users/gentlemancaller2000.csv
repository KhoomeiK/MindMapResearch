You‚Äôre tossing everyone into the same category, when what‚Äôs really going on is that the media is reporting opinions from different groups at different times.  You have to understand the context:  Hardline Republicans have always hated them both, and hardline Dems have always loved them.  But in the primary season (now), the same-party candidates are trashing each other trying to win the party nomination, so you are seeing stories about Dems that like or dislike one Democratic candidate over the other, and it tends to get heated.  Looks like Hillary is sitting this one out, so she‚Äôs taking shots at Bernie, which makes her look bad.  Once the nominations are complete this summer, it will be back to normal, with only cross-party hatred being reported."

Not so much the blockchain encryption system, but the phenomenon itself - how can what amounts to a collection of unique numbers have such value?  I understand the principle behind currencies that are backed by ‚Äúthe good faith and credit‚Äù of a government (as opposed to gold).   I get that there is a psychological aspect to maintaining faith in a currency and once that faith is lost, a currency can collapse.   I just don‚Äôt understand why anyone would have that much faith in bitcoin,  it seems the allure simply an anonymous currency not controlled by a government nor traceable by law enforcement.

news,fempp0n,t1_femov5k,1579265903.0,"It‚Äôs not a bad thing at all.  Profit is the motive that drives the economy and is absolutely necessary.   My point is that there are some things that are worth researching that don‚Äôt show the sort of low risk path to profitability that would entice typical corporate investment, but ultimately could be very important.   Examples might include vaccines for relatively rare but potentially dangerous diseases (Ebola, maybe?), or space travel, which is a case where the merits can be debated, but the resulting technological advances are hugely beneficial.   Imagine if you had to pay a fee every time you used a GPS device.  If industry had funded GPS development, it might not be free and open for all.  But in the 1950‚Äôs and 1960‚Äôs it was clearly a technology that was too risky for any corporation to invest in."
news,fem3rta,t1_fem2gtx,1579238782.0,"The funding had to come from somewhere.  Large corporations who spend money on research do so only when there is a high likelihood of creating a profitable product, process, or service that they own and control.  They tend to stay away pure, basic research for the sake of knowledge or for technology very far removed from commercialization, because there is a low probability of payback.  That‚Äôs why government funded research is important.  While some of it never bears fruit, when it does the results can be shared for the good of everyone rather than being owned by a single corporation."
