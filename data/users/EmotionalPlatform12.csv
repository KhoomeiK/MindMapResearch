> her mom and aunt pressured her last minute

If she's at a club with her friends, and they ""pressure"" her to dance with some guy, is that an excuse? If she knows that you're not okay with it, then she should respect that (because she cares about you and how you feel) and firmly insist to her mom/aunt to stop annoying her about it and leave her alone. 

It sounds like the mom/aunt could be a running problem throughout your time being with this girl. You mentioned that most of the family is from Vegas, so they might just be desensitized to things like strippers/partying. If you try to go on the offensive too hard against them, they'll probably start to try to tease you and whisper things into your girl's ear. ""Uh oh! Don't talk to that guy, you don't want shirtsorskinnedfaces to find out about it! You'll get in trouble!"" *(sound of middle aged women cackling)*. So you need to handle it calmly and not react or get emotional. 

So this could be an uphill battle, and you might stir the hornet's nest when you bring this up to her. But what you should do is, spend some time and think up what personal ""boundaries"" you think should be in the relationship. They should apply to both of you. 

For example, ""Because we're getting serious about this relationship and are getting married, I want to open up to you about some of the things I've been feeling. I really didn't like how you gave in to your mom and aunt and got a lapdance at that Magic Mike show. I understand you all want to have fun, but I think that's a little bit disrespectful to me and our relationship, and you shouldn't let your mom/aunt peer pressure you into doing things. Some guys might be okay with it, but I am definitely not. And if you respect me and want to make me happy, I'd appreciate it if you didn't do things like that, or anything intimate/physical involving another guy, for that matter.""

Be firm. Let her know that you're serious about it, and won't just be a pushover if she doesn't change. Maybe also mention something about her family being from Vegas, and your family being from (wherever) and you grew up with more conservative/traditional family values."
steroids,fcsvvav,t1_fcsuv6b,1577926429.0,"> I trust her

You're in for a world of hurt, buddy. Call the marriage off while you still can. Sounds like she has questionable morals, not a lot of respect for monogamy/marriage, and sounds like her entire family is in the same boat and will always be encouraging her to do stupid things.

Don't do things just because everyone else does them. Starting a marriage off by having you and the bride having separate stripper parties is a fucking stupid idea, if you think about it. 

Find a girl who was raised better and doesn't party as much.

EDIT: Also, some guys are okay with this kind of girl. Lots of guys on this sub are open-minded and go to swinger parties and all that. Some guys are fine with a girl like this. But from what you've said, you are not the kind of guy that is okay with that (and that's fine, neither am I). I highly recommend you think the marriage over."

Besides that, if a girl eyes you up, there’s no harm done in just walking up and confidently making small talk for a few seconds. Don’t worry whether she’ll be creeped out or not, who cares. If she seems not into it, then just continue on (and maybe try again another day)"
