aww,ffe8okp,t3_et4qp6,1579839738.0,Idk why but those cats look to be in poor health.  Wet maybe?
idlechampions,ffbuq3h,t3_eso633,1579783410.0,"Basically every day.  I've reported it.  They basically say did you reinstall?  Did you verify your files?  Nothing works, so now they just say they are looking into it."
idlechampions,ffapyao,t1_ffafmst,1579741751.0,Thanks!  My faq must not be updated yet
idlechampions,ffa581i,t3_esh68j,1579728124.0,Does that include the free plays after the two gold chest runs?
thelongdark,ff4wgfz,t1_ff34dtw,1579574091.0,I've followed a blood trail many times on the Costal Highway out to where the edge of the ice is... and still no corpse but the blood trail continues on into the water.  @#$@#%!
idlechampions,fejpklx,t3_epe81y,1579182548.0,"Don't forget there's a new evergreen coming out 'soon'.  :D  Save 60 chests for that, friend!"
thelongdark,fe5drlw,t1_fe4p6st,1578868196.0,"Thanks.  That's good to know, and with corpses disappearing under the ice never to be seen again.  Things seem weird."
madlads,fdpe9eq,t1_fdoeax6,1578626397.0,No guarantees. Ive seen worse behavior exhibited by mothers ignored
HumansBeingBros,fdp8gu1,t1_fdot2cs,1578622457.0,"Indeed.  Considering how much you drew out of someone not liking your VOX to the tune of how much they research and other things that you can't possibly draw any information about.  Doesn't seem lazy at all.  Hopefully you're the next Elon Musk.  Probably smarter than Elon anyway.  Save us Bestbudsoreosandmilk

But then again, you think VOX is intellectually compelling.  I should manage my expectations effectively. lol"
HumansBeingBros,fdo2n32,t1_fdnl099,1578597762.0,"I research just fine
  Which is why i dont think vox is reliable.  I think your lack of reading usernames confused me with the person who linked something or you're making a lot of intellectually lazy leaps"
HumansBeingBros,fdn0qjm,t1_fdmabpu,1578573686.0,"True, but that's not what I do.  If it helps your esteem to think I do, go for it."
HumansBeingBros,fdm3pwu,t1_fdm0fhs,1578539069.0,"Ahh yes VOX.  The epitome of journalistic ethics, integrity, and lack of spin."
idlechampions,fdm02ln,t1_fdlxsum,1578536607.0,Thanks!
thelongdark,fdkcqxs,t1_fdk7o77,1578501120.0,Thanks for the ideas.
idlechampions,fdh4qxo,t1_fdh11ta,1578415351.0,I'm hoping they all go into Krond's spot like Krull did.  Just to mess with us.
aww,fdh2wvj,t1_fdgx71n,1578414223.0,"Yes, I can.  I should have.  I'll make an edit.  Thanks for the prompt."
aww,fdguv70,t3_elcg4p,1578408908.0,"Just a heads up. Never give your pets cooked bones unless of course you dont like that pet but then I'd just recommend finding a another good home for them

EDIT:  The primary reason for this is with COOKED bones (raw bones do not do this) is that they get brittle and shatter / splinter.  This causes the bones to have very sharp edges that are fairly likely to damage the stomach/intestines which can be costly to fix or fatal.

Raw bones break (resulting in smooth edges) which is why wolves and other bone eating animals are fine."
HomeImprovement,fdec5w7,t3_eky4xx,1578335814.0,That looks like PEX tubing.
idlechampions,fd5fs6h,t1_fd5cml5,1578177217.0,"That's more or less what I do, but I get stuck on the armored bosses without having enough ults / time for clicks to widdle him down before he wipes me.  I'll end up with liek 4 possible champs for 25 levels because it selects champs that the Patron won't allow.

It's nice to have it written out."
idlechampions,fd3ifm9,t1_fd37adw,1578158612.0,"I just ran a test, and you are correct.  Thank you for informing me."
idlechampions,fd3g2vx,t1_fd37adw,1578157981.0,"In this instance, I used the fire breath potionand any scenario where I'm using click damage with an armored boss.  The click damage is to clear the mobs so the hero hits are on the boss (which usually require me to use a fire breath potion), and the armor has never damaged."
idlechampions,fd30ma9,t1_fd2x4hb,1578153625.0,"I have never seen click damage do damage to armor bosses.  

Especially since I had clicks out with my BUD being e107, and the boss' total health was e95 and there were definitely sections of 30+ seconds when ults were down that his armor didn't move.  I survived 5+ minutes (with my bud finally slipping below e94 later on but I had Strix out) which should have done at least 30 armor chunks, but the only time his HP went down was when I did an ult."
idlechampions,fd2n96l,t1_fd2m3b3,1578149643.0,Right and i think the rng is bad.  I keep getting slots that are permanently locked out since it keeps unlocking the same one every 25 levels.  I own all heros too and thought i would have a chance.  Still frequently seem to get the game focusing harder on unlocking the patron eliminated heros so i cant use anything
idlechampions,fd2mwmf,t1_fd2h4le,1578149497.0,It doesnt really finish the armored boss which is the problem.  BUD riding will get me to 300 350 for example but wont finish the boss. And i cant really finish the boss when i get rngd 3 heros that will even hurt armor with their ult
idlechampions,fcx3nbi,t1_fcvrmew,1578049794.0,"Hrm, perhaps because it can extend your click damage length.  I'm not sure which is better."
idlechampions,fcvj7ht,t1_fcv9xyd,1578003238.0,"I use shandie for completing weekly challenges for the patrons and that's about it.  Otherwise, I have to leave for many hours, and either way, her dash bonus is lost at that point as invariably i hit my wall if i have her or not.

However, it is a useful point, but I don't see them adding Shandie style utility in every slot."
idlechampions,fcvj1oc,t3_ej3zss,1578003140.0,"Minsc => Chance to spawn additional enemies (small boost 10% chance for additional enemy in a wave.  2% chance for 2 additional enemies in a wave)  
Sentry => Chance to reduce next area requirements if she wasn't hit in current wave (tend to put her in the back because of this)

Shandie => speed potion on a stick  
Deekin => enemies run onto the screen faster so you can kill them faster and the next wave spawns quicker.  
Xander => If he either kills, or misses an enemy, when that enemy is killed has a chance to double the requirements contributed to complete the stage.  


Korth => Speeds up peoples attacks if they hit a marked target (small boost).  Relatively useful after your click wall and you're main dps is doing the majority of the killing (or at least korth is no longer killing).  When a hero hits a marked target, they get a .25 second (i think) refund on their basic attack.  If they kill the marked, they ahve a chance to just reset their attack cooldown (thus making you kill the next enemie or group quicker)."
idlechampions,fcv24hv,t3_ej2e8x,1577993064.0,"Yeah, I'm not sure why they'll release anything in Krull or Avren's slot now unless they're already way more powerful than either of them.  I don't think an evergreen will ever be more powerful than Avren or Krull."
idlechampions,fcuywcf,t1_fcuu8uc,1577991275.0,I'm currently hoarding gems because I don't know if I should buy Silvers for Shinies or Golds for Feats lol
thelongdark,fcojqjp,t1_fco9ckj,1577833961.0,"There were crows over this one, but I thought it was the wolf I shot as well.  thanks.  I'll report it."
thelongdark,fcj89o5,t1_fciygn2,1577679776.0,"And that makes sense, but I was in a cave without fog."
thelongdark,fchbqne,t1_fcgpxkl,1577649053.0,"No, torch, and flare don't do that.  I didn't test match."
MadeMeSmile,fc5me9i,t3_egb3cs,1577461417.0,Aww!  My worry and luck would be that instead of moving my arm around behind to catch them.  I'd misjudge my location in space and end up just shoving my child into the river. lol Here's hoping I'm wrong!
idlechampions,fc2urj2,t3_efpoyf,1577374601.0,"I did a Time Gate for Birdsong (who I owned 5 greens, and 1 blue on), opened the two chests and still ended up with 4 greens lol... First chest... new blue... Second chest... purple which chose to upgrade a blue instead of a green... so that was disappointing lol (it was even the guaranteed chest and not like an early purple)

&#x200B;

That being said thankfully Mirt and Varja chests are really helping me get all my event champions up to blues!"
