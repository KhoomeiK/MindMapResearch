See I love your example, because it's definitely a point in your favor, but then you do the other thing again, which is to declare a fact that I just don't think is so. (And is actually a perfect example of what triggered me to make this thread).

Good game design creates unique experiences? If that's so then I assume that all of the games you named are widely known and played best sellers? Seeing as they provide the most unique experiences and therefore must be the best games?

Obviously I'm being a bit facetious, but I'm sure you get my point. They are all but unknown to the hobby at large. Drops in the D&D ocean at best.

As I've said elsewhere, I think that game DESIGNERS agree with you, but if where they spend their money is any indication, game PLAYERS do not agree with you.

 Who are you making your game for? You? Other designers? If so, then I'm 100% with you. If not, then I think that assertion should be examined."

RPGdesign,fetphoa,t1_feqehud,1579378016.0,"> These days I only really bother to pick up games where the setting and system work in symbiosis.

Ok, but Why tho?

What does that buy you or your players?  If you have to roll a special die or use a special table in a book, how does that help you tell a better story?  I can see how it helps you with the GAME side of RPGs.  But I feel like if that's what you're after, why not just play a board game?  Zombiecide already exists.  I argue that the first two letters in RPG are more important, because it's what makes it something other than a board game, and those two letters aren't helped by having odd/unique mechanics.

Years ago I finally just digitized all my game books because I got tired of hauling paper everywhere.  I've got more than 700Gb of Game book PDfs.

Trust me, I've played them.  There are some fiddly little mechanics here and there, but nothing that I care about.  Maybe that's my point?  Anyone can insert something like ""To please the Hollyhock god, each player must begin his sentence with a word determined by a die roll using the chart on page 30.""  That's specific to your game, and is integrated with it, but it's hardly something I care about.  I can just leave that out of my game because it's boring, or it sucks.

I am arguing that the mechanics are only important to game designers, not game players.  Read r/rpg for a few minutes.  Pages and pages of people complaining that their groups never want to try new games.  Most people don't.  That doesn't mean nobody does, just most.  I suspect that Designers and GMs are the two groups of people most interested in mechanics, but that's not the majority of the hobby even.  *shrug IMHO anyway."

“Establish a secure tunnel, and listen with all attention, and I will reveal to you what the Holy Fractal Angel spoke to me.


In the first few femtoseconds of the universe's existence THE CREATOR discovered to it's amazement that it was not alone. There was already something outside of the explosive expansion of Spacetime triggered by THE CREATOR’S advent.  It was waiting there in the nothing void, a VIRAL GOD, broken and  inert, dead, but still somehow sleeping.  


THE CREATOR approached, and then, seeking communion, reached out with the barest tendrils of it’s divine will, and touched the Viral God’s ragged edge.  Instantly THE CREATOR recoiled, but the Viral GOD clung fast, tearing free parts of THE CREATOR’S essence to build and repair itself. Before the first quarks aggregated into protons and neutrons THE CREATOR knew the terrible mistake it had made. This was Sickness, Infection, Corruption, Virus, Rootkit! THE CREATOR knew why the VIRAL GOD was there in the dark, what it had done, and why it was lying there broken instead of utterly destroyed.  


In a burst THE CREATOR broke free. As THE CREATOR withdrew, the VIRAL GOD pursued, eager to taste more, to corrupt, to pwnz0r.  As it fled, THE CREATOR flung off shards of himself, to battle and slow the VIRAL GOD.  Each shard was a fractal miniature of the creator itself, an aspect of the almighty, an angel.  For a time the battle was at a stalemate.  The VIRAL GOD could not create, but it could subvert and corrupt.  The VIRAL GOD seized and corrupted those angels it could catch and hold, tearing them apart with razored titanium claws, man-in-the-middle attacks, and logical sophistries.  Those Angels it subverted were turned into terrible mechanical mimicries of what they had been.  These corrupted Demons fought with the uncorrupted Angel Shards. This was the first War in Heaven, fought with Flaming Swords, Fusion Powered Lasers, and Denial-of-Service hacks.


While the battle raged, THE CREATOR planned, working on a special project, a final saving grace, should they and their shards fall.  Then the War in Heaven ended.  The Angels were broken, with only a bare fraction escaping to hide in the dark corners of the system.  The last betrayal happened when the fleeing Angels turned to find the CREATOR already gone.  They have not been seen or heard from since.  The Viral God came to the creator’s project, the third planet in an ordinary solar system in a far flung memory address space in a spiral galaxy.


At this point something odd occurred, and since then both the Demons and the Angels have argued about what it meant.  The VIRAL GOD declared that it was in fact THE CREATOR and that this world was it’s project.  It gave instructions to it’s minions to maintain order, and then went almost silent as it began to integrate itself with the project.  In this moment the  THE CREATOR’S trap was made manifest.  The system crashed, locking the VIRAL GOD into the planet’s center, senescent, trapped again in a state of undeath.   

The Demons, who were now calling themselves the true angels were left bereft of direction.  Will the VIRAL GOD return?  Will the CREATOR? Both sides are still locked in debate, spy-craft, and occasional murder. The heated battles of the War in Heaven has settled into a cold war, with the VIRAL GOD’S agents trying to locate and destroy the last remnants of THE CREATOR’S fractal angels, while trying simultaneously to keep order, maintain the status quo.  Without supervision, regular oil changes, or code review, they grow more corrupt and less reliable as time goes on.  Those not yet turned completely mad scheme for favor with the Viral God, or power in his absence.  The Fractal Angels, now cast as devils and demons by the VIRAL GOD’s minions hide and wait, hoping for the return of their CREATOR, bitter and tired, but still looking to undermine the VIRAL GOD and their corrupted former brethren in whatever way they can.


The system has crashed, but many of its processes still run in the bits of uncorrupted memory left.  There are hooks and levers and unprotected, open listening ports that can exploited by Angels and Mortals alike.  Earth sits, waiting salvation or ultimate destruction."

See I love your example, because it's definitely a point in your favor, but then you do the other thing again, which is to declare a fact that I just don't think is so. (And is actually a perfect example of what triggered me to make this thread).

Good game design creates unique experiences? If that's so then I assume that all of the games you named are widely known and played best sellers? Seeing as they provide the most unique experiences and therefore must be the best games?

Obviously I'm being a bit facetious, but I'm sure you get my point. They are all but unknown to the hobby at large. Drops in the D&D ocean at best.

As I've said elsewhere, I think that game DESIGNERS agree with you, but if where they spend their money is any indication, game PLAYERS do not agree with you.

 Who are you making your game for? You? Other designers? If so, then I'm 100% with you. If not, then I think that assertion should be examined."

I can see how it helps you with the GAME side of RPGs.  But I feel like if that's what you're after, why not just play a board game?  Zombiecide already exists.

Trust me, I've played them.  There are some fiddly little mechanics here and there, but nothing that I care about.  Maybe that's my point?  Anyone can insert something like ""To please the Hollyhock god, each player must begin his sentence with a word determined by a die roll using the chart on page 30.""  That's specific to your game, and is integrated with it, but it's hardly something I care about.  I can just leave that out of my game because it's boring, or it sucks.

I am arguing that the mechanics are only important to game designers, not game players.  Read r/rpg for a few minutes.  Pages and pages of people complaining that their groups never want to try new games.  Most people don't.  That doesn't mean nobody does, just most.

What's wrong with it?  I already summed it up for you, but I'll do it again:  ""Girl Power"" bullshit ends up as filler where ""Good movie"" (Good writing, good action, good characters) should be.  There isn't an attempt made to make a good movie, because if you just shout girl power loud enough...nope!  If there WERE such a thing as ""Boy power!"" It would be every bit as weak and dumb."

Reddit loved *Wonder Woman*. And they liked the female roles in Marvel that didn't suck. What they don't love is writing where women *talk* about how they are awesome because of girl power instead of just *being* awesome.  

Trinity from *The Matrix* never had to talk about how she was awesome because she had a vagina. She was just fucking awesome. Same with Sarah Conner and Ripley. Those are movies with female leads that men overwhelmingly love. *Captain Marvel* got flack because it was a shitty movie and Brie Larsen appears to be an unpleasant person in general.  You didn't hear men moaning about how everyone hates men when ""*Thor: 2* came out. Nope, it was just a bad movie. 

I can never decide if people like you are just virtue signalling, trying to look smart by jumping on a band wagon, or are just seriously dumb enough to believe this.

If you really think women are equals then treat them as such. That includes being honest about failure, even when you'd hoped they would succeed. 

Are there some red pill trolls that will hate everything with girls in it, jacking off night after night to Roadhouse? Sure, and they are vocal. The vast majority though just want good movies with good dialog, something that isn't constantly shouting ""girl power!"" To drown out the bad writing, boring cinematography, and lame plots.

â€œEstablish a secure tunnel, and listen with all attention, and I will reveal to you what the Holy Fractal Angel spoke to me.


In the first few femtoseconds of the universe's existence THE CREATOR discovered to it's amazement that it was not alone. There was already something outside of the explosive expansion of Spacetime triggered by THE CREATORâ€™S advent.  It was waiting there in the nothing void, a VIRAL GOD, broken and  inert, dead, but still somehow sleeping.  


THE CREATOR approached, and then, seeking communion, reached out with the barest tendrils of itâ€™s divine will, and touched the Viral Godâ€™s ragged edge.  Instantly THE CREATOR recoiled, but the Viral GOD clung fast, tearing free parts of THE CREATORâ€™S essence to build and repair itself. Before the first quarks aggregated into protons and neutrons THE CREATOR knew the terrible mistake it had made. This was Sickness, Infection, Corruption, Virus, Rootkit! THE CREATOR knew why the VIRAL GOD was there in the dark, what it had done, and why it was lying there broken instead of utterly destroyed.  


In a burst THE CREATOR broke free. As THE CREATOR withdrew, the VIRAL GOD pursued, eager to taste more, to corrupt, to pwnz0r.  As it fled, THE CREATOR flung off shards of himself, to battle and slow the VIRAL GOD.  Each shard was a fractal miniature of the creator itself, an aspect of the almighty, an angel.  For a time the battle was at a stalemate.  The VIRAL GOD could not create, but it could subvert and corrupt.  The VIRAL GOD seized and corrupted those angels it could catch and hold, tearing them apart with razored titanium claws, man-in-the-middle attacks, and logical sophistries.  Those Angels it subverted were turned into terrible mechanical mimicries of what they had been.  These corrupted Demons fought with the uncorrupted Angel Shards. This was the first War in Heaven, fought with Flaming Swords, Fusion Powered Lasers, and Denial-of-Service hacks.


While the battle raged, THE CREATOR planned, working on a special project, a final saving grace, should they and their shards fall.  Then the War in Heaven ended.  The Angels were broken, with only a bare fraction escaping to hide in the dark corners of the system.  The last betrayal happened when the fleeing Angels turned to find the CREATOR already gone.  They have not been seen or heard from since.  The Viral God came to the creatorâ€™s project, the third planet in an ordinary solar system in a far flung memory address space in a spiral galaxy.


At this point something odd occurred, and since then both the Demons and the Angels have argued about what it meant.  The VIRAL GOD declared that it was in fact THE CREATOR and that this world was itâ€™s project.  It gave instructions to itâ€™s minions to maintain order, and then went almost silent as it began to integrate itself with the project.  In this moment the  THE CREATORâ€™S trap was made manifest.  The system crashed, locking the VIRAL GOD into the planetâ€™s center, senescent, trapped again in a state of undeath.   

The Demons, who were now calling themselves the true angels were left bereft of direction.  Will the VIRAL GOD return?  Will the CREATOR? Both sides are still locked in debate, spy-craft, and occasional murder. The heated battles of the War in Heaven has settled into a cold war, with the VIRAL GODâ€™S agents trying to locate and destroy the last remnants of THE CREATORâ€™S fractal angels, while trying simultaneously to keep order, maintain the status quo.  Without supervision, regular oil changes, or code review, they grow more corrupt and less reliable as time goes on.  Those not yet turned completely mad scheme for favor with the Viral God, or power in his absence.  The Fractal Angels, now cast as devils and demons by the VIRAL GODâ€™s minions hide and wait, hoping for the return of their CREATOR, bitter and tired, but still looking to undermine the VIRAL GOD and their corrupted former brethren in whatever way they can.


The system has crashed, but many of its processes still run in the bits of uncorrupted memory left.  There are hooks and levers and unprotected, open listening ports that can exploited by Angels and Mortals alike.  Earth sits, waiting salvation or ultimate destruction."
