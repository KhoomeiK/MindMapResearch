Going back into ancient history, no. The heliocentric model didn't become widely known until roughly 500 years ago (though that's an unfortunate quirk of history, since we now know it had been proposed at least a few times going back to the Ancient Greeks, but was rediscovered and finally took root during the Renaissance). Prior to that, for the most part, people interpreted the motions of the major planets (which were well characterized, being correlated to harvests) as being the paths of their gods - in the Ancient Greek pantheon these were well-characterized by, for example, Apollo's chariot drawing the sun across the sky each day. After Copernicus (1543), it only took about four decades for Tycho Brahe to nail down the details, at which point you have essentially the modern gravitational model of the solar system - although Newton wouldn't show why mathematically for another century. At any rate, by around that time (ca. 1600) anyone who was involved in astronomy would have a conception of other planets as physical bodies like the Earth.

Yes, you should be seeing the same thing with rockets, for the same reason: any fuel you waste going up is fuel you could have used to go sideways.
