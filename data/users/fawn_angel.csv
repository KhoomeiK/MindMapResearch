What respectable chef doesn't know vegetarian options? NTA it's your birthday, you should be able to eat a good meal!"

Also I can see her taking her brothers here and there every once in a while, but they have parents! Are they at work during their soccer and robotics? NTA!"
UnsentLetters,fdt53kg,t3_emqwlb,1578712031.0,You are my fucking hero!

AmItheAsshole,fdqs7pl,t1_fdqhupc,1578673755.0,"You and the fiance could have gone, her for extensions and you for a wash and very short TRIM. You go so she makes sure her hair is longer. Problem solved!

But your uncle handled it like a asshole! NTA and I wouldn't go! I wish your family was more supportive.  I'm sorry they aren't. But you can have your hair any style you want! Don't give in to them and don't go! And if the family isn't going to be supportive stop answering the phone!"

AmItheAsshole,fdlnroh,t1_fdkb3i8,1578528217.0,"This! And SIL knows your wife just had a baby so she should think,""well, Bob is a junkie and sis had a baby so she probably has narcotics. I should be upfront in case anything happens."" I can't believe ANYONE would have the NERVE to blame you! Someone steals from you, and you are blamed. Let's think that through. What if he had stolen $1000 and bought drugs with it? Would they blame you then? No! I'd hope someone would be apologizing profusely! (Which is what they should be doing!) 

And you ARE NOT part of the problem for having narcotics in your own home. He's part of the problem, for stealing them and for everything else he is doing! Tell your family to kiss your ass and from now on no family can come to your home for Christmas!"
AmItheAsshole,fdk4u8e,t1_fdi6aka,1578496081.0,"I'm so glad your grandma is okay! 

I was going to say, enjoy your grandmas! I lost mine and I miss her so much and I'm also beating myself up for not visiting more!!"
