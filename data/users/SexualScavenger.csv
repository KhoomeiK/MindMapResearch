So now, if I have kids, they will be addicted to medicine... which can be taken away if there is some catastrophe... and these events tend to happen upon this violent planet.

Having enhanced mitochondria allows them to resonate the field of energy, which all life gives off, at a rate greater than 10k hz. As any HAM knows, this is how radio waves are created and propelled.

Perhaps back then, those who couldn't see very well were considered to be lower in the attractive scale.

Every advance we make in corrective technology allows defective/imperfect genes to proliferate. I know that sounds dangerously harsh, but, it's mathematically accurate.

Diabetes, for example, is more widespread due to the fact that mankind discovered insulin, and now they can have kids. This bothers me deeply since my father was a diabetic. I am therefore, unfit to exist, since I should not have been born. And yet, I want to live anyway."
