In addition to that, take a look at the most jobs per type in our economy ranked by size.

I suggest watching some of Lindybiege'd videos about chainmail."
ReasonableFantasy,fepwoq2,t1_fepmazc,1579333609.0,"They did carry hammers though. They had swords, a hammer, and a 'mercy' knife on them for fighting plated opponents.

Also, I'd love to see a longsword thrusting through chainmail in front of a thick gambeson. I really just don't see that as being possible with how tightly interwoven and strong chain was. It generally took very specialized equipment to counter armor like that. Sure, maybe if you landed a perfect blow, but against a moving target, I feel like it'd just glance off. It's hard to comprehend just how effective chain mail was. It was the best armor available for over 1,000 years. It took that long to find weapons capable of consistently dealing with it such that Plate and other full body armors had to be invented.

Like I said though, it wasn't that they specifically made the longswords for blunt trauma, it's that against a plated opponent you were much more likely to score a damaging blow by bludgeoning or staggering rather than slashing or cutting. A sword is just a much more versatile weapon than a hammer because you're not going up against just other Knights. It was also a status symbol and the weapon Knights trained with, so it was easier to adapt into something that fit the role needed more so than changing the weapon entirely and throwing out all that experience."
ReasonableFantasy,fepkn5m,t1_fephzwm,1579322978.0,"You'd be aiming for joints, but not to slash or to cut. Underneath plate was chain and thick padded armor that even a razor sharp sword in full swing wouldn't cut through.

You're hoping to tire them out, stagger them and knock them down so that you can get them while they're vulnerable. That's what you do with the long sword against full plate. Against less armored targets, the edge is much more useful. 

I think people don't realize just the sheer hulking tanks that full plate knights were. There's a reason that armor was so expensive."
ReasonableFantasy,feoooi9,t1_feoaoqn,1579303177.0,"I'm not saying all European swords were dull.

I'm saying against plated opponents and even most chainmails, sharp swords weren't as useful as something akin to a Zweihander, which was almost more like a halberd than a sword. To take down a knight in full plate armor, you basically needed to stagger them, break their bones, or get them onto the ground where you could slip small, sharp daggers / swords into their armor joints.

Against more lightly armored targets (which was most opponents) one handed swords or bladed weapons that were sharp were a lot more effective. But Chainmail basically countered almost all slashing/piercing weaponry at the time, but did not afford great protection against bashing or weapons that had a lot of kinetic impact behind them."
ReasonableFantasy,fenxemx,t1_fencu6r,1579292206.0,"\>  Also, FYI, swords canâ€™t do that. A war hammer might, but again, such a weapon would be effective against any armor.

Again, you're conflating fantasy with reality. Swords **did** do that. The whole point of a Longsword or Greatsword wasn't that it was very sharp and could cut through things, it was used as a means to bash through armor and cause blunt trauma.

When you look at the evolution of armor and combat in ancient and medieval society you see a lot of stabbing/thrusting weapons in ancient society. Spears were easy to give out and train with, but they also were effective against the armor of the time, which was light plate around only vitals or segmented armor. These armors still left gaps that a spear/gladius thrust could exploit.

In medieval times, chainmail had become much more widespread and even landschnekt would probably be able to afford pretty comprehensive armor (not full plate). Weaponry of Knights changed because it was pretty much impossible to cut through full plate at the time, so they instead tried to bash, stagger, and disorient the opponent. A full hit in the shoulder from a broadsword wouldn't cut through the armor or into the wearer, but it **would** shatter their clavicle and prevent the enemy from fighting back.

When you look at wound reports for knights in medieval times, mostly all wounds came from blunt force trauma to the head or from arrow wounds in the small joints of armor where plate couldn't be placed and a bodkin arrow pierced the chainmail/gambeson underneath."
ReasonableFantasy,fenvoa0,t1_fencgrp,1579291625.0,"The problem with ""Boob Armor"" is that it actually offers less protection than a molded breast plate. The whole point of plate armor is to take a blow (a heavy blow) and disperse the force around the armor of the chest such that it doesn't destroy your internal organs/bones/etc. This is why plate chest pieces were often in concave pattern, it pushes the blow around vitals and helps absorb the shock.

The boob plate, a convex pattern, takes all that force and shoves right into your fucking sternum, probably shattering it. So not only is it unrealistic to portray (eg; no armor was ever made like this for combat), but it's actually dangerous and would probably cause more trauma than it would protect the wearer."

City maps are brawl camp fests that only test the team's ability to use armor effectively or to peak / trade effectively. It's a scenario where 99/100 the team with the generally higher alpha tanks just wins.

Open maps allow for actual skill to come into play in the game. Scouting, bushing, using camo and view range effectively. Knowing key positions and being fluid about the map to address and adapt how the battle is playing out. Maps like Mal, Prok, Live Oaks, Murovanka,  etc test much more complex skills sets and are much higher skill cap maps IMO."

summonerschool,fefz8ux,t1_fefbydu,1579070322.0,"To perhaps give a different perspective, I used to be a support main back when I played LoL more competitively and so it was very difficult for me to solo carry games. I couldn't go to a place, take resources, and then just smash the same way the other roles in the game can. 

I focused on coordinating my team and working around those that were strong. I made sure if one player was AFK split-pushing that I covered his ass and gave him vision so that he (and the rest of the team) could make plays off of his pressure. I got my ADC fed and then C O V E R ED their ass all game. But if they were useless, I didn't hesitate to drop them and work with my mid or top or jungle. I tried to keep the team focused and their heads in the game. Encouraged cooperative play and told people to cut it when they argued or fought.

 It was frustrating at times when you get a team where no one is on the same page, no one wants to cooperate, or no one seemingly understands how the game will / should play out. But the important thing to keep in mind when climbing, maybe the most important, is that any individual game doesn't really matter in the grand scheme. Always try to win, but don't get caught up. In the end, if you're better, you'll climb; It's just about numbers. Play at least 300 games a season and I guarantee you'll see yourself going up ranks."

suicidebywords,fdt1eem,t1_fdt0b9y,1578710665.0,"The same thing happened to it that happened to T\_D. You can't run communities on satire for ever, because eventually enough people join who *don't think it's satire.*

What makes me the most sad is the fact that I feel like the gaming community was specifically targeted by white supremacist and alt right groups and that it fucking worked. It just sucks because, for example, we have AGDQ going on right now and that's what I feel like the gaming community really should be about -- But there's basically two groups now and you often can't separate them out."
lotrmemes,fdt0giw,t1_fdsn3e4,1578710322.0,Generally speaking if you're in a castle you sally out to fight if you think you even have a hope of winning and/or you know there's no army coming to relieve you. Otherwise you just get surrounded and starved out.

australia,fdps208,t1_fdpmdte,1578638289.0,"I'm not in any way trying to defend CEOs here. More saying the system is fucked from the top down. 

These are laws and bylaws common with CFOs, CEOs and the like. The system is designed to keep the wealthy wealthy. This is just another tool in the box to do it. 

But as per your examples, the degree of enforcement is often left up to a the board in question."

MovieDetails,fdp8su1,t1_fdoxqqi,1578622681.0,"I dunno if people would, watching that scene over again just reminded me how fucking terrible that movie is. Huge reliance on really awful CGI that looks like it's in fast forward and blurred to obscure the bad render detail.

Couple that with the bad tactics, bad choreography, and worse acting with PUNCHY ONE LINERS^(TM), Those movies are just a mess start to finish."
australia,fdp6vu6,t1_fdox0ak,1578621394.0,"Actually, weirdly he can't. He has a legal requirement (yes, legal) as CEO to put the financial security of the business/ corporation first; Otherwise he can be removed or worse.

>A breach of a fiduciary duty may result in personal legal liability for  the director, officer, or controlling shareholder. State statutory law,  judicial decisions, and corporate articles of incorporation and bylaws  may also impact a person's fiduciary obligations to a corporation.

This is why corporatism is so fucked. You legally have to be an asshole and disregard everything for profit. It's baked into the system."

This is one of those things where I'm not really sad the local business is gone. Access to food at cheap prices is one of the best things for helping poorer communities. Local markets just can't get prices to reasonable levels."
aww,fdmx0n8,t1_fdmv9fj,1578569655.0,"They're flock guardians, so anything the percieved as the flock gets guarded, this would included children. I've heard they're great with kids (exceptionally gentle and patient), but I've also heard that sometimes if a parent is disciplining their child, the pyrenees will try to get in the middle of it and break it up (not violently) the same way they break up farmyard disputes with other animals. 

I have owned a pyr now for 8 years and know a few people that own them as well and I honestly wouldn't compare them to Golden Retrievers in the slightest like the above commentor did. Maybe if they grew up with them, but Pyrs tend to be a lot more neurotic and have a lot less energy than goldens. They're also incredibly wary of strangers and need a lot more socializing than a more friendly breed. But they really are amazing dogs. Big ol' fluffly friendly giants. That is, until they think one of 'the flock' is being threatened and then they flip into guard mode. They can also be a lot to handle for someone new to dog ownership, as males can be in excess of 140 - 150lbs."

DnD,fdjf6d6,t1_fdiqqvf,1578468218.0,"I know you mentioned you wanted people to comment if there were inaccuracies in the English. In the second panel ""Pursuit the Pleasure"" isn't right. I'm not sure what you're entirely going for, but something like ""It's time for fun!"" might be closer. The word ""Pleasure"" can have sexual connotations, but is also just the overly formal word for enjoyment, fun, etc so it could still work in this case if you're wanting your monster Cthu to speak a little 'high-brow' or sound overly educated/ under socially acclimated. 

Love your comics btw, they're very enjoyable."

Sometimes there's 'solutions' to lady problems that I've helped her with too. A good example being stumbling across /r/abrathatfits from this subreddit several years ago and helping my wife get away from needing two bras every day because department store sizing is a sham."
