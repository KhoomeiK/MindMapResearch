That's on top of her getting paid for the day off."

Even then, it's not like you're able to access the old user data to any extent."
Android,ff1qe4j,t3_eql6th,1579483866.0,"I've used about 70GB of my 512GB 11 Pro Max. Does it feel excessive? Kind of, but I've also only had the phone for 2 months, so that could change.

I shoot a LOT of 4K24/60 video on the phone and so I think its definitely useful to have without relying on a paid cloud storage subscription to maintain my data."
AskReddit,ff0skgn,t3_equ586,1579471903.0,"So you'd have to spend 130m in those 10 hours, at least, to put a sizeable dent.

Easy. Buy some extravagant mansion in LA. Easy couple hundred million there.

Then, you buy any possible collector classic, super and hypercar. No, that's not enough. You buy out Jay Leno and some collectors in Abu Dhabi.

To stretch it even further, you invest a couple hundred million into Google, Apple, Facebook, etc any company that would guarantee you'd have money left at the end of the 10 hours.

When it's all said and done, you sell everything a week later. Then you're worth a billion dollars or more.

Congratulations."

dating_advice,feezz0h,t1_feds38v,1579044961.0,"Both the OP and your comment are golden. The echo chamber is a dangerous thing, but over been talking to this new girl for the last couple weeks and I can see the quality and depth of the conversation increase, and I needed this reminder. While I do believe things are going in a positive direction, the insecurity odds are still very much alive. It's hard not to think about but I'm trying to stay calm and flow it properly rather than forcing it, which is definitely something I've struggled with. If I don't think a relationship will work I'm definitely kinda quick to call it quits, especially when the interaction is so new."

wholesomememes,fe6xb8g,t1_fe6r84t,1578907124.0,"Been there; done that. Man it's a hard thing to get over, but you can. I don't say it to sound cliche. It's just sometimes you need space and allowing yourself to breathe and vent and let it out.

What I did was take something you enjoy and find a way to make it therapeutic. 

Personally I am not a very good singer, or a fan of bars but I love karaoke. So I'd sing ""Fine Again"" by Seether for what was easily a couple months on end.

Then I got the courage to talk to said friends about the situation which led to the one being cut off. You have to take it in waves. It will never be easy to get over and become yourself again, but it can be done.

I'm now in a state where life isn't perfect - it's stressful still, but I'm learning more and more, growing, and have a great group of friends; old and new that I cannot imagine life without.

Stay strong OP. The light at the end of the tunnel is there. The journey is rough but the other side is a beauty."
wholesomememes,fe6r02s,t1_fe6osp3,1578901296.0,"Cutting ties with toxic people in your life is truly what allows you to thrive. You can do this, I believe it.

I was in a toxic relationship myself early last year - had to cut ties with two different people, one who had been such an important person to my life over the last 7 or so years, but now that they're gone, it's an entirely different planet. You miss em but you realize that you're better off without them, and there's plenty of room for em to be replaced with people who serve your life so much better."

JettaGLI,fdjkx2n,t1_fbxcchd,1578475745.0,"I don't think it's possible for the DSG to ""fart"" as these cars have an electronic linkage to the transmission vs a hydraulic linkage you might see on a car like the S5, etc. 

This is also why the shifts feel a bit boring unless you add aftermarket extensions or something to that effect."

Connecticut,fdd5hap,t3_ekjiu0,1578295653.0,"I agree with this. While I haven't been everywhere, as someone who grew up on the northern part of the PA/NJ border and now lives in NJ near the city...

I love Connecticut. Sure it's not perfect. Sure it has some traffic problems, the roads aren't perfect etc but I do enjoy how open it is.

Growing up in PA I watched my town get cluttered like absolutely nothing else by the time I was old enough to leave, and it's only getting worse. It's great for the economy, but makes living there an absolute disaster.

Enjoy the open space while you have it, because one day that might change as people begin to realize how much potential the state has. It's kind of an unloved gem for now."
