> I never said, ""Rimuru is a lolicon tho"" Im fairly certain I made myself clear(in my first comment above) on that a part.

Your initial assertion, note the post title, is that that is a team of lolicons. Rimuru being in that picture means that you are claiming that Rimuru is a lolicon. And:

>Well too bad, literally Everybody in tensura mistakes Rimuru for a loli. Aaaaall the time.

Doesn't change your initial statement at all.  I'm not arguing that Rimuru looks like a young girl or not. I'm only saying Rimuru is not a lolicon, which you claimed.

>Its funny how you said, ""Sora is not interested in loli""

Sora isn't interested in lolis in general, only Shiro, and it has nothing to do with her appearance. He generally prefers large breasts.

>then be like ""he loves petting a loli's ears and tail"" right after.

The fuck does that have to do with being a lolicon? Is petting a dog bestiality?  Sora and Shiro just like petting fluffy animal girls, they get lines of pretty much everyone in the beast kingdome coming to get pets from them. They play games against Miko to pet her.  Ear/tail petting isn't showing a sexual interest in a loli.

>Raphtalia? Filo? apparently you legit dont know who Naofumi's wife is, go read the wn.

I've read the LN, which is the official canon.  There has been no marriage with Naofumi. He does show potential interest in Raphtalia, but by demi human logic in that world Raphtalia is no longer a loli, she has grown up physically and is more often more mentally mature then Naofumi.  Raphtalia is likely an adult by demi human standards.

>Legit loli (Every girl who's below 20 years old and around 150cm tall

What? This is a joke right? 20? 5ft tall? Are you nuts? Lolis are literally children to pre teens at the latest. Fucking 20 year olds are adults.

>Fake loli (Girls who are over 20 years old and around 150cm tall

While height is a part of it 150cm (5ft) is way to tall to fit into the general loli category. But even so it's still more about the overall appearance. Looking like a child.

Fucking 20 years old! HAH."

TenseiSlime,fdq6mhx,t1_fdpq22r,1578657135.0,"> Well too bad, literally Everybody in tensura mistakes Rimuru for a loli. Aaaaall the time.

Doesn't make Rimuru a lolicon or even hint at it. Hell it pretty much makes it impossible, by all accounts Rimuru is around 2 years old.

>So does with the lolis, meaning that Sora definitely has loli complex. in his past life, he's legit married to a loli.

I very much see where you're going. But first, Sora isn't interested in Lolis, except Shiro which could be argued makes him one but he clearly prefers large boobs.  As for Hatsune Izuna, he's only interested in petting her ears and tail.

Past lives clearly don't count for one. Second the wife was a robot, of relatively equal size as him, not particularly childlike at all.

>Naofumi's waifu is a loli, yep he's legit married to a loli. a bunch of lolis.

Naofumi shows no romantic interest in anyone.  And Raphtalia while chronologically she's young, she's an adult according to demi human physiology, so even if Naofumi had interest it would be fine. Unless you're talking about Filo, then we're off in a whole new direction.

>there's NSFW scene between the Gate guy and a fake loli(961 years old loli)

You mean where she's all but trying to rape him? Rori doesn't look like a child, she's just got a petite body. Don't conflate that with being a loli.  As for his Ex they were similar in age having met in school seems to fall into the same category as Rory.  Literally everyone else around him is just helping out.

Not a single person in your picture is strictly a lolicon.  Sora is conditionally on that loli being Shiro.

You seem to have a misunderstanding on just what a loli is.  It's a child, or at times someone that looks like a child.  That does not mean ""small boobs equals loli"". You're almost as bad as Reddit admins on that."

Sullivan had the strength and courage to strike the bear with a tree branch. He claimed that this was the twenty-second time he hit a bear with a stick in his lifetime.[2]
