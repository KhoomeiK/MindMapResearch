worldnews,ffpbhql,t1_ffowlzs,1580090912.0,"I'm suggesting that *you* believe the NYT, not myself. Bolton's book can allege whatever it wants. I'm simply pointing out that a bastion of liberal news media reported that the Dems believe Trump's removal of miss ambassador was a **crucial** facet of the ""abuse of power"" claim. So that directly implies Trump was going after Biden in 2018, before he even announced his candidacy. That timeline doesn't jive, and it's obvious.

All this is moot anyway. The Dems have already failed to capture the publics interest in impeaching the President. No one is watching, and no one cares. Put up your candidate, watch them get trounced on the debate stage, and wait for the DNC and liberal media to fabricate another conspiracy as to why they lost 2020."
worldnews,ffmp6uf,t1_ffmfbbm,1580057444.0,"Sheesh, I link you the article from the NYT explicitly stating that the firing of the Ambassador is central to the Dem's ""abuse of power"" claims, yet you just keep asking me where it states that in the actual document. Look dude, if you're claiming that the NYT article is lying, then fine. Just say that. But it seems like you're eager to back petal all the statements Dems have made about the firing of this Ambassador, and pretend it was never used as impeachment ""evidence"". Suddenly, after Republicans started pointing out the date discrepancies, this never had any relation to impeachment.

Keep living in your bubble. I promise you, most Americans quit caring about this farce before it even got out of the House."
worldnews,ffmcscy,t1_ffmb6l1,1580052517.0,"According to the [New York Times Article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/us/politics/trump-recording-yovanovitch.amp.html)

>The campaign to remove Ms. Yovanovitch is among the central elements of the Democratic case that Mr. Trump abused his power in an effort to pressure Ukraine’s government into announcing investigations into purported meddling in the 2016 election and into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his diplomacy in Ukraine.

Gee, it sure seems like the House Democrats think Yavonavitch's removal was related to pressuring Ukraine into investigations, **as well as Joe Biden**.

But I'm sure *you* know better than the New York Times, huh?

Again, if you believe Democrats, then Trump was pushing to investigate Ukrainian corruption long before he could have known it would lead to information that *might* help him against Joe Biden. The timeline quite literally undermines Democrats own premise."
worldnews,ffma7wk,t1_ffm6nie,1580051329.0,"Please, do tell what you seem to think this PERSONAL GAIN was.

Parnas claims Trump removed the ambassador because she was hampering his attempts to investigate Ukraine. The evidence he provides is from 2018, a year before Biden announces his candidacy. Therefore, if you believe Parnas' story *at all*, then you must believe Trump was concerned about Ukrainian Corruption *before* he could have known it might hurt Joe Biden's future campaign.

It's not that complicated dude."

2. The fact he was asking about *Hunter* Biden isn't some smoking gun, especially now that these tapes **prove** Trump was concerned about Ukrainian Corruption over a year prior to the *phone call*.

3. These tapes show a pre-existing interest. The Dem's claims that Trump only wanted this looked at to hurt Joe Biden because he's a rival presidential candidate, is now proven totally false.

4. Trump could have withheld that aid for any any reason. It's within his authority to do so. Other presidents have withheld aid to politically pressure nations. Just because *you* or the Democrats in the house don't approve, is actually what is irrelevant here."

It's not even illegal for Trump to have used the aid to pressure Ukraine into get something he wanted (a.k.a ""Quid Pro Quo""). Literally, the entire premise behind Trump's actions being illegal/criminal is predicated on the assumption that he was doing it to hurt a ""political rival"".
