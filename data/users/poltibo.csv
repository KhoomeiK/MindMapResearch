FIFA,ffcrq90,t1_ffcrh0w,1579805894.0,Ok well let me get a rare electrum players pack for 7k as well then
FIFA,ffcqvpa,t3_eswsaf,1579805371.0,"So you are telling me that because I get out late of work I have to pay 150k more than EVERYONE ELSE to get him ....?   
They might as well discard my Mohamed Salah, it would cost me the same ....  
I'm done tbh ..."
FIFA,ff9as1l,t3_esd594,1579708725.0,Mbappe's flag should be only Blue and White because he will never get in my Reds
FIFA,ff93n9r,t3_escaz3,1579704047.0,"If you think EA has got you by the balls, stop playing FIFA. Personally, I like cool card designs which I think are part of what makes FUT attractive."
FIFA,ff8v8z8,t3_esa8vu,1579697254.0,"Was going to do the same with Real Madrid but they put too many Real icons in the same icon swaps batch for me to get them all ... Raul, Figo, Hierro, Essien, Seedorf"
facepalm,ff6pkav,t1_ff6n74u,1579632204.0,"Dunno man, by the 5th time you would get bored"
FIFA,ff66v5a,t3_erhr03,1579620545.0,"The problem are the objectives, not the game mode. Let's say there was a special mode for objectives. Ok, you would get fair matchmaking and keep your high division in Rivals, but you would have to play that much more to actually enjoy the rewards that you get being in a high division. No way. I'm not playing WL + Objectives + Rivals games every week. 
So, maybe, they could put some weekly reward system in that Objectives mode ? Well guess what, everybody would just play this game mode with their normal squad to seek easy wins and fast points for rewards, and it would be the same as it is today. 
Then, maybe the objectives mode could give Rivals rank points without affecting the division points ? Well people in div 1 & 2 would just play this game mode to avoid risking decaying in divisions. 
Only solution I see would be an objective game mode in which you have to meet the team requirements of the objective in order to start the game."
facepalm,ff60x2c,t1_ff5lrs7,1579616291.0,"Not really, who is terrorised if everybody is dead ?"
FIFA,ff5tyf2,t1_ff5tssm,1579610141.0,"If you have untradeable Rio, don't pay 800k coins into varane to replace him, not worth it imo. Just save for a banging attacker !"
FIFA,ff5tobb,t1_ff5q15a,1579609840.0,"Funny you mention it, I precisely replaced Rio with him. I have only played a few games with him and I think both card are equally as good. 
I'm keeping him because I'm a huge fan of Varane and because this card has the potential to evolve where Rio doesn't."
FIFA,ff3t1yk,t1_ff3sme0,1579548236.0,"Yeah, I can't stand Herv√© Mathoux and Pierre Menes lmao, but to be fair I mostly just mute the game and watch something on the side"
FIFA,ff3sgty,t1_ff3qy9s,1579547874.0,"I did, had to put a contract on him and now he's back to normal"
FIFA,ff3sdd6,t1_ff3qc16,1579547814.0,Headliners in French ... As a French i can tell you even in French it sounds horrible
FIFA,ff3sabk,t1_ff3qvnh,1579547762.0,Not really the point of the post lol
FIFA,ff3q7q8,t1_ff3q5g7,1579546494.0,"Nah, turns out it was just a visual glitch. Weird though"
FIFA,ff3q0gz,t3_erhkb3,1579546371.0,"Turns out it was just a glitch, used a contract on him and he's back to normal"
FIFA,ff3pygr,t1_ff3ppte,1579546338.0,Yes apparently I bought an untradeable card lol
FIFA,ff3pvet,t1_ff3pr9r,1579546285.0,"Also says 0 owners though, what are your thoughts on that ?"
FIFA,ff2k15g,t1_ff1vhr4,1579509672.0,"Yeah, and even on these packs the odds are shown in such a shady way, changing from 86+ to 87+ from one pack to another. Just show a list of ratings/ card types and put a number in front of it, how is that hard ?"
FIFA,ff2jpg6,t3_er39x0,1579509229.0,Wow with FIFA 20 I forgot that El Tornado even existed
FIFA,feqb0bi,t1_feq8ql5,1579339601.0,"Damn you're right, thanks for precisions. Let's just hope EA will give him a +6 boost then !"
FIFA,feq5v5c,t1_feq3y3o,1579338068.0,"What do you mean ? If he gets a +1 upgrade and goes to 75, his FIF should go from 80 to 81 (because 74 and 75 rated players both get a +6 upgrade), then his SIF should go from 83 to 84 (because 80 and 81 rated players both get a +3 upgrade), and so his headliner should go to 86. Am I forgetting something ?"
facepalm,fedphno,t1_fecvg59,1579017068.0,"I mean it was real in 2008 (did a bit of research), I hope that by now this kind of campaign doesn't exist anymore"
FIFA,fdwrocm,t1_fdwqxzj,1578761706.0,"Well I have literally nothing left lol. Only thing left is a few bronze and silver players, and 83+ untradables"
FIFA,fdwqi6l,t3_en6fp3,1578761378.0,"I started grinding PL upgrade packs with 3000 players in my club. Converted bronzes into silvers, silvers into gold, and gold into the 2 PL upgrade SBCs. 
I have now 300 players in my club. I packed ONE. FUCKING. WALKOUT. VERTONGEN."
FIFA,fdmxs2m,t1_fdmn3y2,1578570561.0,"I would normally agree, but if there is one week out of the whole year when you should take packs is this week. You get players to help you grind SBCs and you get a chance (very small but existing) to get a TOTY."
FIFA,fcydrtk,t1_fcxfckr,1578078547.0,"Exactly my plan ! I'm taking Zambrotta for the meta, then Figo or Raul because I am a big Real Madrid fan"
FIFA,fcydftz,t1_fcxnb08,1578078424.0,Maybe but he will never drop as far as being not worth it anymore. He is first by a LARGE margin right now
FIFA,fcyd4nq,t1_fcxo0dx,1578078344.0,"If you do SB anyway, just wait until the next objectives. With just SB you could even go to zambrotta"
FIFA,fcx1j66,t1_fcvzqme,1578047078.0,"Yes that's my bad, completely forgot about him in my spreadsheet ! 
He is exactly the same price in coins and in tokens as Koeman, so in the ranking you can duplicate all Koeman's combinations and replace him by Seedorf"
FIFA,fcx1bjk,t1_fcx0p6t,1578046796.0,That's probably EA's plan
FIFA,fcw35g9,t3_ej8171,1578016057.0,"No wonder they retweeted the fake EA direct account, the troll told the right wait time lmao"
FIFA,fcw2w34,t1_fcw2pnx,1578015887.0,But Capa with Shadow has 98 speed ? Surely that's good enough ?
FIFA,fcw2l4h,t1_fcw2dzh,1578015685.0,"Did you try IF Capa instead of Semedo ? He's cheap, and with a shadow he feels very good, and he still green links to Pique"
FIFA,fcw28ph,t3_eizy7k,1578015460.0,Lmao your description makes it even more glorious
FIFA,fcw21dl,t1_fcw1v0p,1578015328.0,Good luck ! My advice though: open the icon pack BEFORE getting VDS. Imagine getting Middle VDS in the icon pack lol
FIFA,fcw1spy,t1_fcw1f5k,1578015168.0,"Good choices, but isn't choosing 2 CBs and a GK a waste of the easy chemistry you get with 3 icons in your team ?"
FIFA,fcw11uw,t1_fcw0xeq,1578014677.0,"Van Der Sar is one of the best choices for value though, just look at how often he is part of the best combinations"
FIFA,fcw0qcy,t1_fcw0lb3,1578014469.0,"Or just by the 1 coin haha, tbh I didn't go further than a simple Excel formula"
FIFA,fcw0j40,t1_fcw0834,1578014338.0,"Haha yes, I could have rounded it up a bit"
FIFA,fcw0g31,t1_fcvchi7,1578014282.0,By the time you manage to chat you are 3 games ahead on the one you wanted to comment on lol
FIFA,fcvz9o1,t1_fcvz2cs,1578013502.0,"There could be Carlos Alberto imo, but I think the last set of icon swaps will be largely irrelevant because of TOTS and people just leaving the game"
FIFA,fcvz0ae,t1_fcvykgd,1578013328.0,Sure. A lot of people seem to advise taking Blanc regardless of his value anyway
FIFA,fcvydeu,t1_fcvwulf,1578012915.0,"I agree that Campbell is not OP, but he sure gives you a fright when you see him in front of you in in-game!"
FIFA,fcvy85t,t1_fcvxp7r,1578012818.0,"Don't let that stop you though.   
Those are untradeable anyway, so their value is quite unsignificant once they are done. If your favourite player is Pires, go for it imo"
FIFA,fcvy0ie,t1_fcvxpfw,1578012678.0,"Yes, you need to find yourself something on Netflix to go through them haha !"
FIFA,fcvwj0t,t1_fcvvxxq,1578011699.0,"Statistically, yes.   
As a motivation, tell yourself that each token you grind is worth 80k coins if you go for Essien !"
FIFA,fcvwath,t1_fcvvkxh,1578011548.0,"I actually think Essien and Del Piero will be the last to drop in price, because each time a new set of objectives is released, some of the icons will be made craftable and will probably drop. Essien, Vieira, Del Piero and Ronnie will be available last, so I think their price will hold longer.   
Apart from that, I think all icons prices will slowly decrease uniformly so it won't alter this ranking."
FIFA,fcvuo77,t1_fcvuiil,1578010502.0,There will be 24 in total
FIFA,fcvuljg,t1_fcvu3r1,1578010454.0,"Good choice, and even if it doesn't work for you, you can still position Koeman as CDM in-game."
FIFA,fcvu5o2,t3_ej6qpi,1578010173.0,"A small analysis I made while figuring out which icons I would choose for myself.

I  sorted the possible maxed out combinations by coin value per token needed and selected the top 30. The 'Choice 4' columns are only used once, for the VDS/Hierro/Moore/Rijkaard combination, which is lower in the board.

What is interesting to look at is that in the top 10, Zambrotta is part of 6 combinations! VDS  comes second in this matter, being part of 4/10. It was also interesting to realize that each token has a minimum value of 30k coins (avg 50k),  which is an extra motivation when you are doing theses endless challenges.

Personally, I will probably go for the Zambrotta / Figo combination which looks very solid,  and which is the second best combination behind Essien in terms of total coin value.

Important points: 1. Prices were taken from futbin (PS4) at a specific date and will vary, especially when the next set of objectives is released, as every icon up to Zambrotta will be available. 2. These only include the  MAXED OUT combinations, because when I did the analysis I had already decided that I would do at least 20 objectives.

I hope this will be useful to somebody, I am open to suggestions to sharpen the analysis!"
FIFA,fcuqrnx,t1_fcuqg0i,1577986604.0,"Same here, that's my point exactly: If this Pique was an attacker I would have replaced him a long time ago, out of boredom."

FreeKarma4U,fcune9f,t1_fcunc1p,1577984707.0,Have some as well !
FIFA,fcumqlc,t1_fcub1t9,1577984330.0,"I am thinking of doing the same thing with Vardy, but maybe it's worth waiting for a possible winter upgrade ? He's banging IRL"
FIFA,fcumhm0,t3_eizf5i,1577984182.0,I wish it was like that on PC :(
FIFA,fculp4t,t1_fctom2q,1577983736.0,"Plus playing with the same attacker for the rest of the game would get boring, whereas a defender I wouldn't mind that much"
FIFA,fculf63,t3_eivcp3,1577983574.0,"A defender all day long, I would rather spend the rest of FIFA playing with the same defender than with the same attacker or midfielder, I like to change these positions often !"
