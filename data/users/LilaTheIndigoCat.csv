because you're sending a message that trans people need to earn the right not to be misgendered and deadnamed, that they have to prove to you they're worthy. and there's no reason for any of us to think you'll just stick to people that are *proven* to be predators, or even that you'll stick to predators in general. one day you're calling jessica yaniv a he and the next you're calling blaire white ""sir"" cause she told you she likes pineapple on pizza. you can disagree with trans people without stripping them of their identity for the sole reason of hurting them as much as possible, not to even start with the fact that trans people are capable of being bad human beings and not every predatory trans woman is actually a man using the trans movement as a cover. sometimes the gays are bad too my dude, and that still doesn't justify you misgendering them.

and I get that you're mostly arguing the sex toy thing but I was mostly arguing the several implicitly transphobic comments you made and the fact you twisted my words. so yeah there's nothing really to argue here, you just gotta pay attention to the thread you're replying to and maybe not repeatedly say that lesbianism inherently excludes trans women, which implies trans women aren't women."

GatekeepingYuri,ffv3ya7,t1_ffuzw0d,1580255111.0,"lesbianism excludes men, not penises. you falling in love with a straight woman has nothing to do with your genitals it has to do with the fact you're a woman and she's attracted to men. you're giving a reason as to why people are calling you transphobic. a lesbian says she wouldn't date a trans woman, someone asks why, and she says ""I'm a lesbian"". that directly implies trans women aren't women. if she doesn't like penises then maybe she should say ""I don't like penises""? simple, direct, and doesn't make her sound transphobic because not all trans women have dicks. and the fact you claimed calling lesbians bigots for complaining about trans women ""invading"" women's spaces (because yes that's what the conversation was originally about) is homophobic further implies you don't think trans women are women. you say you believe they deserve their female identity and yet you keep implying that a trans and cis woman dating somehow wouldn't count as a lesbian couple. you're not just digging yourself into a hole you're digging a whole ass ant colony."
GatekeepingYuri,ffv173q,t1_ffus63x,1580253327.0,"yes, lesbians are women attracted to women, which includes trans women. people aren't just their genitals so no, trans women don't count as men. I'm not saying you think they do but the way you worded that implies you do.

and yes obviously the topic of sex and genitalia would come up at some point, especially if you're dating a gay or heterosexual person, but that doesn't mean that you're required to have penetrative sex with a trans woman. hell most of them don't want to, cause, surprise surprise, ***trans women don't want to feel like men***. and, again, they have fingers and mouths, genital-to-genital sex isn't the only option. not to mention how this whole argument completely ignores that not all trans women have penises."

GatekeepingYuri,ffupwtr,t1_ffuo8ao,1580247052.0,"I never said it's the be-all-end-all of sex, I'm saying that ""but they have a penis"" isn't a good argument for why a woman isn't allowed in a lesbian space. it doesn't mean anything. either you think it's dangerous for someone with a penis to be around women, which is inherently sexist, or you think anything phallic being involved in a lesbian relationship is somehow not legitimate, which goes against not only trans women but also intersex women and, yes, women who like using strap-ons.

also, all your arguments for why you prefer dildos over penises seem to be in an attempt to make penises seem disgusting, especially since half of those points don't even apply to trans women's penises.

dating a trans woman doesn't require you to have penetrative sex. trans women have fingers and mouths too, as well as brains and hearts and hobbies and, you know, other things that go into a relationship beyond genitals?"

yes, there's nothing wrong with accidentally using the wrong pronouns for someone who doesn't ""pass"" as their preferred gender. but not all trans women look like men in dresses? it honestly sounds like you've never seen a trans woman in your life, like seriously even on youtube there's plenty of trans women that pass very well. nikkitutorials, miss london, contrapoints, hell even blaire white. you seriously telling me you would look at all of them and think ""oh yeah that's obviously a man"" while passing them on the street or in the grocery store?

and on the topic of actual men in dresses, I'm gonna use my own experience.

I'm genetically female, I have a vulva, I have breasts, I have a somewhat feminine face shape, even when I wear clothes that mask my body type and make me look more androgynous I'm still mostly referred to with female pronouns. I'm told that I'll be a girl no matter what because I was born with a vagina and XX chromosomes and that's the end-all-be-all. my own body, my legal documents, and many people all tell me I'm a girl. I feel completely uncomfortable in the role and body of a girl while feeling completely comfortable in the role and body of a guy (a nonbinary guy but my point still stands) but everything around me tells me that it doesn't matter. that's the reason calling a dude who likes to wear dresses a ""she"" isn't the same as misgendering a trans person. sure, he could feel hurt by it and that's completely valid, but fundamentally he'll always be a man in every single way while I and many other people can be our preferred gender in only *some* ways. people calling us by our preferred pronouns is essentially the only thing that confirms us as our true gender rather than the one we were designated at birth, at least for trans people pre-transition or early in transition.

in terms of how you can be more inclusive, if you don't know someone's pronouns you can just ask. for most people, you'll get it right by just guessing, either they're a passing trans person or a cis person who mostly looks typical of their gender. you'll still encounter some people who don't pass and guessing their pronouns would usually result in you misgendering them, or you'll encounter nonbinary people who want gender-neutral pronouns which most people don't guess automatically. if you're too embarrassed to ask and don't want to misgender someone you can either wait for the person's friends to use a specific pronoun or just use ""they/them"" by default, both will usually work fine.

finally, I'd recommend going to subreddits like r/asktransgender and r/ask_transgender and asking some questions if you're still concerned with how to approach these sorts of things, try to be respectful as possible and start off with simple questions about what terms would be best to use when talking about these issues and such. use a throwaway if you're not comfortable with using your current account. I can also answer some questions if you want, I'm relatively comfortable with talking about these sorts of things so ask away."

also I get that the term to its core isn't sexist but it's mostly used that way, so when someone's actually mansplaining telling them that won't do anything and when someone isn't mansplaining accusing them of such will only shut down a discussion and make you look like a prick. it really doesn't have much use beyond making fun of someone outside of the conversation you're having with them. essentially it's a word you don't use outside the groupchat."
