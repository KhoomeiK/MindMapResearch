movies,ffe8zpc,t1_ffe65l2,1579839992.0,"One could argue that their privilege is exactly why men kill themselves in higher numbers. Men believe that there really is something better that is being kept from them, that they deserve, and it depresses them when they think that the ""norm"" should be that they get that thing.

Women, on the other hand, we know that that thing is out there, but we're so used to not getting it that killing purselves seems rather silly. We will kill ourselves over plenty of things, but not that. 

The other thing is, and this is very important, part of the problem with the patriarchy is that men are paradoxically benefiting the most while also being its biggest victims. For example, in Fury Road, the ones at the top of the small society are a small group of men. They make the decisions, they get the best food, they get the women, etc. You could argue that the Wives and the birthing mothers don't have it that bad, but they aren't really a part of that society. They can't make decisions, they are forced to give birth and they are punished if they do not have healthy males, something they really are in no way able to decide. And then you have the War Boys and the mostly male population left to rot around the Citadel. Basically, the men at the top are only able to survive because of the sacrifices of the women and men at the bottom.

Part of the point of Furiosa's victory isn't just that she's helping the women here become active parts of this society, but that she is also raising up the males who wouldn't be able to be a true part of it either."

movies,ffe7x44,t1_ffdwtbs,1579839119.0,"I guess I never thought about just how, well, removed from reproduction men actually are. As a woman, even if I never intend to give birth, I know it's a possibility. I know I could get pregnant and I know I would probably be mostly responsible for said child. 

I guess, it must be weird to be a guy and realize how little you actually have to be involved in the human process. Men are necessary, but we simply don't need as many of you. And really, you aren't built to last, not like women are. You're only needed for a short time.

But I think Fury Road does a good job of showing how men are necessary-Furiosa and the other women needed Max and Nux. Even if they were mostly muscle, that muscle helped to save the day. And Max's medical knowledge saved Furiosa. Rather, I think the point of the movie is exactly what Carlin is saying, yes, but it is also about how all humans need each other and how femininity and masculinity are partners."
