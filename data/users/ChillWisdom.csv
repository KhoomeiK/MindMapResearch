relationship_advice,feyq0j3,t3_eqvfzt,1579449088.0,"If you're in a relationship where you suppress what you want just to keep the relationship, you will start getting depressed because you are not being true to yourself. You are already seeing the beginnings of your dissapointment turning to resentment. Do not settle for good enough, hold out for your perfect person. When you start dating again I suggest giving the guy an HJ fairly early on so that you can see what kind of equipment your getting from the start."
