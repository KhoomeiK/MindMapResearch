The perspective in each of those shots is clearly different, therefore you moved *the camera*. Changing the focal length doesn't change proportions of objects in your frame. Moving the camera does. Got it now? Protip: use a tripod next time.

pics,feu9jg1,t1_fetla57,1579384465.0,"> wide angle lenses compress the size of things in the distance 

No, they don't. Wide-angle lenses have a wider field of view / lower magnification. They can fit more of the world inside the frame, which tends to make you move closer to your subject in order to make it appear larger. It's this change of distance between camera and subject that ""distorts"" or ""compresses"" proportions and spatial relationships. Because that's perspective, and perspective only depends on the position(s), not the lenses.

Nope, read more thoroughly. Quote:

According to this, birds, crocodiles, dinosaurs, and turtles are all Archelosauria. But that doesn't mean at all that turtles are dinosaurs.

The [Wikipedia article about Archelosauria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archelosauria) shows a diagram from that paper you found. It has turtles (Testudines) as **siblings** of Archosauria. And Archosauria / [archosaurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archosaur) is the group that includes dinosaurs, crocodilians, and birds.

So, even if this is correct that Archosauria are Archelosauria, and turtles are Archelosauria as well, then that still doesn't put turtles within the subgroup of dinosaurs.

Because what's ""short"" and ""long"" is entirely dependent on the sensor size. When people are taught that ""short focal lengths distort and long focal lengths compress"", and then hear that the iPhone Xs for example has a wide-angle lens with a focal length of 4.25mm, and a ""telephoto"" lens with 6mm, then they might come to the conclusion that they'd get an awful lot of distortion with both of those, because the focal lengths are so much shorter than what you'd use on a DSLR, for example. That's of course nonsense. Like you mentioned, you could try to introduce 35mm equivalent focal lengths, but then you add yet another layer of obfuscation that requires explanation. Why not teach it properly from the start - it's not that complicated:

1. How much of a scene you can capture on your photo depends on your field of view (FoV), not simply focal length.
2. FoV is a function of focal length **and** sensor size (longer focal length or smaller sensor --> narrower FoV).
3. If you want to take frame-filling shots of a subject, then a wider FoV tends to make you move closer to your subject, whereas a narrower FoV tends to make you back off. This change of camera-subject distance changes perspective, i.e. the spatial relations, proportions, etc. of everything in your frame.
4. Perspective distortion is a thing. It is caused by that change of distance, not by lenses or focal lengths!"

You shouldn't, because the real answer isn't focal length, but magnification / field of view. Of which focal length is only one contributing factor - sensor size is the other. With a sufficiently high-res sensor, you could crop the image down (effectively decreasing the sensor size and therefore narrowing the field of view / zooming in) without getting ""horrible pixelation"". ;)

And [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tod2qZnKZEQ) I linked there debunks that misleading photo series of yours, which shows the effect of distance, not focal length.

Focal length, together with film/sensor size, determines the angle/field of view. You can take great moon shots both with wide and narrow fields of view, you just need to get the focus and exposure right. If you want to see more details in the moon, you simply need a higher magnification = narrower field of view, which can be achieved by increasing the focal length *or* decreasing the sensor size (while keeping sensor resolution constant, or better increasing). You're right that most phone cameras are unsuitable for that, because they have a wide field of view, which is more useful to people in ""normal"" situations. But with the advent of multicamera phones, [that is starting to change](https://old.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/eo2nmv/eli5_why_can_phone_cameras_not_take_good_photos/feaqngs/).

The growth lines prove that it's not an extra scute, though. It is a crack, but probably just superficial and nothing to worry about. My adult male Hermann's tortoise has one in the exact same spot! And at least one of his many offspring got it as well. I've also seen it on some other unrelated Hermann's. Could be genetic, or maybe there's even an anatomical reason that makes cracks in that location more likely. Come to think of it, this is the area of the plastron that is open during development ([the ""navel""](https://i.imgur.com/WcjV3mn.jpg), where the yolk sac is attached), that could have something to do with it.

That's not true.

The lung volume of a Greek tortoise for example is reduced to 20% when fully retracted. Luckily, tortoises can cope with surprisingly little oxygen.
