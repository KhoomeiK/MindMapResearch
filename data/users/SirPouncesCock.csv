YouOnLifetime,ffk21fn,t1_ffk06zk,1580013395.0,"I was just joking but please don’t spread the misinformation that needing therapy has anything or do with intelligence or lack there of. Depression or other mental health issues can affect people if any intelligence. John Nash is one of the foremost geniuses of the 20th century and he had a therapist. Perhaps Ernest Hemingway or many other creative geniuses would have lived longer than if they had access to better therapy in their time or were willing to go. Would you consider yourself smarter than them?

I think a good metaphor is a mechanic. You may consider yourself more intelligent in a general sense than your mechanic, but he knows more about the inner machinations of an automobile, so you go to him or her for help.

In addition to being familiar with the inner workings of the human psyche, a therapist is simply an impartial person able to view your situation from the outside looking in. Even a best friend with only your best interests in mind, may not be as effective because you could be embarrassed by the nature of your thoughts or a whole host of other issues.

No one is too smart for therapy, if you are lucky enough not to need it, than you should be thankful. However, many people are not so lucky, whether they be smart, dumb, or average."
