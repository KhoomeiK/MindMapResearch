Like I said, we could quibble over court decisions and dates, but Jim Crow laws enforced segregation in the South, and titles 3 and 4 of the civil rights act explicitly desegregated public facilities and public education. 

It is entirely irrelevant to our discussion that Brown v Board did the same thing before, or that Plessy v Ferguson upheld the Jim Crow laws that were in force at the time, you’re just quibbling over this to distract from the gaping hole in your argument. 

And yes, those rights that protect from discrimination in school, at work and in public life.

Because that discrimination was a racially motivated and resulted in the systemic erosion of rights of the black minority in the south.

The founders were not guided by a 20th or 21st concept of civil rights, but they were guided by overarching principles of the enlightenment that were progressive for the time. The constitution was amended as the values and circumstances changed to expand  and modify the rights outlined at the founding of the republic. 

Western democracies have, guided by the same general principles, trended toward more equality and more protection for human and civil rights. 

Racial segregation is antithetical to those values. It does not maximize the free association of its citizens, it does the exact opposite of that.

The idea that a racially motivated resegregation in a place that still glorifies the prior instance of it would somehow be totally different in its mechanism and effects is laughable."
news,fctjb5z,t1_fcthkh8,1577945255.0,"You are quibbling with minutiae that are irrelevant to the overall argument you’re making, which is that it’s totally normal and expected for a southern state of the US to reintroduce segregation, if that’s the will of the majority. 

Let’s imagine that federal laws disappeared and this happened.

The reason this is not cool at all is that it infringes on the rights of the minority in a pretty severe fashion. 

From Wikipedia: 

“Liberal democracy is a liberal political ideology and a form of government in which representative democracy operates under the principles of classical liberalism. Also referred to as Western democracy, it is characterised by elections between multiple distinct political parties, a separation of powers into different branches of government, the rule of law in everyday life as part of an open society, a market economy with private property and the equal protection of human rights, civil rights, civil liberties and political freedoms for all people.”

The founders were guided by the principles of classical liberalism and enlightenment, and the US has embraced these principles in its history. 

What you are describing is an illiberal democracy, where the majority is not bound by the principles of classical liberalism, protection of civil and human rights, etc.

news,fctgnqo,t1_fcszdx0,1577942664.0,"Jim Crow laws enshrined the separate but equal legal principle of racial segregation.

We can split hairs here about Brown v Board preceding it or the other provisions of the act, but the above is broadly correct and to claim that the civil rights act is not in large part a response to the gruesome Jim Crow laws of the preceding decades is bs.

The second half of your comment.. I don’t even know where to start. 

Basically, you’re saying that if the Civil Rights Act was repealed and fucking Alabama, which is about 70% white, was somehow able to reintroduce segregation through a majority vote in a plebiscite of some sort in 2020, that would be “normal and expected, like it was before Civil Rights and integration”.
