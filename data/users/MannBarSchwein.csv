Advice,fevbp79,t1_fev8t3j,1579395478.0,"Ah I must have misread part of your OP.  

What part of it is confusing?  Is it because you sit there and think about it and then ask yourself constantly why you're thinking about it? 

If so that's called an intrusive thought, which we all get! But being unable to get rid of them is a sign of an anxiety disorder.  Think of obsessive compulsive disorder: if someone has true OCD they will have a compulsion to do something and their brain lies to them that something is going to happen unless they do that thing, making it also an anxiety disorder.  This ruminating and being unable to get rid of that thought can be a chemical imbalance or a learned behavior from a parent or older sibling.   Luckily they do make pills for that and therapists are great when you need them.

Also being 19 means that all of your opinions are subject to change.  Sometimes literally by the moment. If you want to be someone with an open mind, then be that and remember that you won't always know everything, nor will your initial reaction always be the correct one. Moving forward it might benefit you from being around a gay person once in a while and so long as you don't immediately dismiss them for their sexual habits then you're probably doing better than a lot of people.  I mean don't dismiss anyone strictly based off of sexual habits either, but you can express a disinterest in a person's sex life without being mean or rude."
Advice,fev6qzv,t1_feuyzjq,1579393763.0,"So to fully flesh this out this person is MtF trans and at the time of your encounter was fully male bodied? If so I want it to be clear that is an entirely different sexuality.  Many people who are homosexual still have difficulties surrounding trans people, but it's important to remember that gender, sex, and sexual orientation are all very different and confusing and difficult to work with or through. 

 It seems as though you may just not be into her or just unable to divorce sex and gender. If you're not into her then you're not into her.  If you hate her because of something she can't change, then yes that's an issue.

While we likely have differing opinions I personally don't see that interaction as not straight, yes it might be homosexual (sex characteristics as the primary focus for that word) but still a straight act.  
  

I think it's interesting that you say you weren't raised to be around homophobia in the OP, but you mention your mom telling you to not be gay.  Regardless of her action or motivation behind it, her problem if you were to turn out gay is definitely homophobia.  If you value your mom's opinion, then yes this impacted you.

I'm not saying that you're projecting, but it seems as though you're wrestling with a person who had feelings towards you but is not a gender you're compatible with.  If it is a learned behavior could your hang up be that you just don't want to be queer and that's the hang up? I guess what I'm asking is that what causes you to hate the gay sex act? Is it because you picture yourself involved in that act and actively don't want to be involved in it? Is it because sex acts between two people not yourself make you uncomfortable? (ie does thinking about a man and a woman having PIV sex and you're not included weird you out?).   is it that you've just always in some way shape or form been told it's wrong? The whole ""hate the sin but not the sinner"" message gets very confusing when you actually care about other people. 

For the record I also don't think you're a piece of shit at all.  Can I ask how old you are?"
lifehacks,fes72o7,t1_fericap,1579362073.0,I mean 15 for a family account isn't an egregious amount of money for most families loving outside of poverty.  A family account will cover up to 6 people for premium and it wouldn't be hard to teach parents around 30s-40s how to use it and the benefit of premium.
Advice,fernxc5,t1_feqxs9m,1579356297.0,"I promise no judgement from me but as a queer person I find this response the most interesting and I have questions.   

Initially what made you consent to the acts to begin with? When you engaged in the acts did you feel the disgust and hate towards yourself during or was it only after? 

I'm sensing a lot of learned behavior to be quiet honest.   The idea of having issues with gay men and none with lesbians is indicative of strong socialization.  A lot of people who have issues with gay men don't have issues with lesbian women and that's primarily due to the issues with female sexuality: for a lot of men, lesbian acts and female sexuality are seen as ""for the man""."

Edit: Also the pixel benchmarks were nothing horrible by any stretch of the word.  I think at this point it's like splitting hairs between flagship phones."
ProtectAndServe,feiq5ws,t1_feh07g1,1579144448.0,"Am dispatcher. I was not trained for pizza orders, however I was trained to ask more questions and not just dismiss something like that immediately.  So it would still work with me and most people in my center.  Someone saying ""pepperoni pizza please"" would probably prompt me to say ""you got 911, do you have an emergency"" in which case saying ""yes"" would mean they're getting officers."
GooglePixel,feipqcs,t3_epcz8p,1579144153.0,"Honestly, the pixel 4 (xl) seemed like a let down from specs and earlier reviews, but I did have one for 2 months and was forced to switch due to my carrier and already miss it.  I think it got a lot of hate for really ridiculous things.  I can understand not thinking it is nice enough for the price, but I really think it's a case of not being able to knock it until you try it.  

My partner came from an iPhone and much prefers the 4xl and I ended up on a Note.  Honestly both of us would take the 4xl at this point I think."
LifeProTips,fed9zn5,t1_fec7ypa,1579005189.0,I looked through a lot of city's library pages and it looks like Chicago allows you to sign up for an ecard. I don't know the extent of it but if you put in a zip code and then used a rental on like Zillow in that zip code you might get an eCard allowing you to use their stuff online only

aww,feafhxh,t1_feadz2u,1578948075.0,"The entire Instagram is not like this at all so I'm not sure where you're seeing that.  Someone calls the owner out and he verifies that she was enjoying it.  While you are allowed your opinion I'd trust the person who spends every waking minute with her.  

At one point she does expose her throat.  Anxious or scared dogs tend to keep their throat and stomach guarded."
aww,feaclcj,t1_feac4yr,1578947027.0,Even though they are so cute they are still a working breed and they need a pretty firm hand.  People adopt them thinking the cute 30lb dog will be easy... Then they run the house and become terrors
aww,feac6oo,t1_fea5f6k,1578946884.0,"She is pretty well behaved and her parent takes really really good care of her.  I promise that he would be the first to say she needs space.  The whites of eyes, and ears back are because she's getting those pet and pulled back slightly from that.  

I suspect she's a bit overstimulated, but a nervous or uncomfortable Corgi will whine or bark to let you know they've had enough.  Trust me if she's done she will let you know since her breed is well known for being vocal."

AskReddit,fdgw26v,t1_fdgsc0c,1578409749.0,"Right which is why we have certain criteria to use them which is exactly my point.  They aren't as frequent as the person replying makes it out to be, they are also not used in every situation like they assumed.  

If anything me saying ""if it were my kids..."" Is that it's ridiculous to be offended that someone wants their kids found.  If you don't want to get woken up by alerts then turn them off or keep your phone on silent while you sleep. On most modern phones you can set certain things (like phone calls from particular contacts) to notify you in different ways.  There's no excuse to be woken up by Amber Alerts if you don't want to."

I ultimately identify as pan and when I clarify that to someone I don't get asked further questions unless it's ""what does that mean"" to which I respond that I like men, transmen, transwomen, and women, roughly in that order but am with a man and will be with that man for a very long time."

askgaybros,fd27gpx,t1_fd1ktvs,1578142883.0,"This has been a HUGE thing for decades.  Incest fantasies have definitely been a thing for a very long while.

Dan Savage was discussing a study a few weeks ago about how most people that reported it weren't actually thinking about their family members but rather the actors.  I can't remember which one it was but I want to say it was mid to late November.  Porn is make believe and part of the fun of it is that it's not real and you can use your imagination."
askgaybros,fcr41ia,t3_eifyjy,1577896465.0,"As someone also in Idaho I really have to ask which part of Idaho you're in.  Because the state is pretty big it has 3 pretty distinct regions and attitudes.  If you're in the North part I can guarantee you aren't the only one, but the best strategy up here might be to just leave everyone alone. Everyone up here just really wants to be left alone.  Boise and Moscow all have definite queer and supportive communities and I'm sure in one of those you'll find youth centers or other clubs for LGBTQ kids.  Join them! 

Southern Idaho is a total different breed and I don't have a strategy since I haven't spent much time down there.  I guess it would be similar to up here.  Don't isolate yourself, but just remember youre not going to make everyone happy all of the time and just don't engage with the people you know you're not going to make happy."
askgaybros,fcfuluo,t1_fcd85g5,1577633865.0,"Just curious if you've considered intermittent fasting for a while.  I'm a big boy too (some medical issues that are finally being addressed) but it's the only thing that has actually helped me combat the hunger from dieting and eating smaller meals and lose weight.  Basically I skip breakfast and don't eat until 10 or 11 am and then eat as normally as I can until 6 of 7 pm.  The hunger sucks and having to get used to black coffee can be difficult, but black coffee and carbonated water will go a long long way in helping you feel full on an empty stomach.  

I've been off of it since it's been the holidays and shift work can make it difficult, but I've found that it really works for me."
