Like, friendly NPC says the cave is empty. Perception check. You pass, he looks nervous, he's  probably lying to you. You triumph, you notice he's figgiting and looks very nervous, he's obviously lying to you. You fail you see nothing. You despair, you still see nothing but now I as the GM am going to make this guy seem much more trustworthy.

Vigilance could also work for this, as they both favor keeping an eye on someone and looking for tells etc. But perception I feel gives away less as it could also be to see if anyone hears an incoming speeder etc."

As a rule though, working out *properly* and at a medium weight range will strengthen your muscles and help prevent serious injury.

But it has nothing to do with the recursion specifically, the Kings/queens, rowans, lucians, conference, ""call"" weapons all display this behavior.

They can't just buff enemies across the board and buff gear as well. Because you have to remember that just by virtue of being on an online forum discussing the game you're putting substantially more into it than most players. Most players are more casual, and just theory crafting on their own, they might have 1 good annointed gun and some decent gear but they're the ones who can't get by in MH3 or 4. 

If you buff the enemies to help the experienced players with better gear then you alienate those other players, who are the majority of the actual playerbase. Sure they could keep that just to MH4, but they did that when they created MH4 and everyone complained and people said they'd quit because enemies felt too bullet spongey, now that people have adjusted MH4 is just normal play for some, but many just ditched. They don't want to repeat that.

That said I think they definitely could do more to buff other gear to bring it up to even a usable level, but with hundreds of guns and literally trillions of combinations of loot mixed with the apparent spaghetti code that is this game, means they're airing on the side of caution.
