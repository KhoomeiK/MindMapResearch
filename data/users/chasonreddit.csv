Gene manipulation right now is at the stage of writing useful code in the 50s.   First you had to design the hardware, then code the application in machine (or assembler if you were lucky)  To do all that you would need a couple of degrees. Then came mass-produced machines like the IBM360.  You could learn on one and code on another, they were the same.  But they were very expensive, you wouldn't have one at home.

The big change came with microprocessors.  Now you could learn to write code on one machine and there were many others that could run it.   And do it at home.

(Baby boomers started in 1945, so by 1975 the first were 30 and the younger were voting age.)  Thus we can logically blame them for any bad policy decisions made from 1975 to the present.

So of course the OP starts talking about housing policies since 1933.  Just a minor error.

> The Bush Administration ran with the idea that owning your own house is the path to middle class stability and independent wealth and encouraged home ownership. Pretty soon afterwards you get the subprime mortgage crisis

Although the Bush administration was certainly pushing home ownership the crisis was undoubtedly set in motion by the changes to the CRA (Community Re-investment Act) which changed Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae rules to encourage home ownership. In particular lowering credit standards and literally enforcing loans to minorities. There was nothing wrong with making sure minorities had access to mortgage money.  The problem was that to meet quotas (yes, there were quotas), people with very poor credit had to be given loans.   That was the Clinton administration.   At worst (and it was pretty bad) the Bush administration did not push through reforms to change it or regulate it."

> why did you choose to focus on project management (instead of product management)? do you prefer one over the other?

This was mostly just circumstance.  I came from a consulting background. (Back in the day we called it ""job shopping"".  Independents just hiring out, not really part of a company)  Then you get on teams, then they ask you to lead a team, then you take a management role, then you take a job with a larger firm...  Product managers usually start as employees of the company, so I was never really in a position to do that function.  I do have several old friends who are lifer product managers (just now retiring themselves) at a major aerospace firm. They seem happy and much less stressed than I was even when they were managing REALLY big projects.  Think a new missile system.  We pretty much just bitch to each other when we are together, so I get the impression the challenges are similar.  



> what did you most enjoy about the ""classic consulting firm"" structure? did you want to work on other structures?
> 

Enjoy most about it?  Very little.  It was very high pressure, high stress.  I suppose it did offer a lot of variety which appeals to me.  I've always been a generalist not a specialist. Our firm tended to be a little more boutique in services than the really big firms.  I think of Anderson (now Accenture) and DeLoitte as examples.  You have a big project and (by reputation) they bring in a busload of recent college grads on a tight schedule.   But I did have projects of 60 consultants and up. 

> how much travel did you do?
> 

Personally, very little. That was also a bit unusual but our company was organized by regions.  I was in the largest, the Chicago metro area and really never had to travel for assignment.  Again that's not usual.  I sometimes had to travel on behalf of the client who might have a branch in NJ or something, and there's always this or that conference or all hands on deck meeting, but nothing like other consultants I know who travel 75%.
> what did you find the most challenging and most rewarding?

Challenging?  You are expect to hit the ground running.  No on the job training, no orientation. Hell you are expected to have a plan to bring others up to speed on day 1.  Rewarding?  There is always the reward of pulling off a project successfully.  It's never a cakewalk, so there is always a sense of accomplishment. 
> how have the duties and expectations changed over the years?

I can't really speak to that.  I was only in that industry for about 12 years and retired from it about 2005.

> can the work be easily outsourced to India for example, or is there a strong preference for locals?

Again, outsourcing was just beginning to be a thing when I retired. I would say it depends a lot on the type of work.  Certainly high speed internet has made it easier to share a code base globally.  Many of the projects I worked on really couldn't be outsourced too much.  You can't really work on a radar system without access to the actual radar. 

> what hurdles does someone starting out have? (i worked for a startup whose revenue increased tenfold when i was the accounting manager, i was in charge of managing/improving processes to circumvent the growth, in addition to performing accounting functions.)

Man, I wish I could say you are mistaken, but I have to agree.  I always tried to be respectful, even handed, fair.  I would also say that a lot of people that worked for me would disagree. (although in my own defense I always got great 360 reviews)

In defense of the breed I would say that you have to wear a LOT of hats.  You have to work with your own company's management including billing, staffing, sales, hiring, and plain old bosses, the client management, the other client stakeholders, often the client's clients, the project staff, plus everyone else that calls you.  And you have to be a different person to each of these.  Working with clients (the ones that hire and pay you) requires equal parts arrogance and ass-kissing.  Working with department staff requires a lot of political savvy (learn the office politics of 4 new companies each year).  Working with your own consultants, well I thought I invented the term ""cat herding"".   All I can do is plead stress and ask for time off for good behavior. 

Edit:  I will add here that I *have* noticed a kind of inverse correlation of the size/importance of a project and the ass-holiness of the PM.  I have a friend I'll call Capt. Ned who managed an X- project for the Air Force.  Mellowest guy you ever want to meet.  I've also known PMs managing a bank ATM update who looked like they were trying out for the lead in ""Trump - The Musical"".

> The Anthropic Principle declares that some physical phenomena, such as the “gravitational constant”, “electric charge of a proton”, the “mass of electrons and neutrons” are inevitable and carefully designed matters, and any alternative expression of those would render the entire human existence Impossible. What it goes on concluding is this actually means that all of these phenomena have been completely adjusted to suit humans and their lives.

The anthropic principle makes absolutely no claims about ""carefully designed matters"" or ""adjusted to suit humans"".  Those verbs are inserted to make it sound more ""intelligently designed"".

He then goes on to quote a more accurate depiction of the term

> According to Carter, “Our position in the universe is highly distinctive, to the degree that corresponds to our existence as observers”, that is, if the universe had not been organized in a way that allows us to exist, and subsequently observing this very universe, we would not be present at all to dazzle its compatibility with our existence.

But this brief moment of clarity is wiped out with a quick segue relating the anthropic priciple to monotheism.  This is, of course, pure rubbish.   In it's purest form it simply states that there is no need to posit a creator making a universe perfectly because if it were not perfect for ANY reason, we wouldn't be here to observe it."
