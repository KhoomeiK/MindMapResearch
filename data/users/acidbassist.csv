OP, I am with you too. Best of luck. We can do this my friend! I am truly happy for you!"
offmychest,fescqwi,t1_fercvoz,1579363909.0,"This is beautiful. I honestly teared up reading this. I remember years ago I was essentially homeless, saved only by the few friends who would let me surf their couches in somewhat of a rotation. The ONLY thing that got me through those times is knowing how anyone would react when they found me. Somebody, whomever it would be, was going to be forever changed in the worst way. 

Look, life sucks. Thats just what it is. But its also pretty amazing. I have list so many people in my life, some of the best friends and even my family barely associates with mw now. But through everything, its gotten better than it ever was. It took years and a shitload of effort, but its finally better. 

Anyone who sees this: DONT GIVE UP. I would have never gotten married had I quit trying. I would have never gotten to look into my daughter‚Äôs beautiful eyes. I am not idealistic; I know I am lucky. I also know I wasnt always. I had an ex call the suicide hotline on me when I threatened to end it all. It was embarrassing, and it felt like someone was reading a textbook of the reasons to live. I had arguments with many people about how I wasnt meant to be happy. I was determined life would always suck. 

It changes if you are willing to put in time and effort. Believe me, nobody is destined for unhappiness. Thats an excuse we tell ourselves when we feel helpless. What you have to realize is you have more power over your situation than you may realize. You may just have to make some choices you dont want to make. 

If it helps, I am here to talk to anyone who may want or need."
offmychest,fesa7f8,t1_fepcn4l,1579363148.0,"‚ÄúHold my beer‚Äù. That last lime is well said my friend. Regarding your father, that sounds like some motivation. I used to have a wallpaper on my phone to remind me first thing every morning. All it said was ‚ÄúSometimes I feel like giving up. Then I remember I have a lot of mother fuckers to prove wrong‚Äù.  I once had a friend tell me there was no way I could truly succeed given my background. I dont come from money, so I wont ever have the chance to get money or true success. I am now in college, pursuing my dream job. In short, to hell with anyone that doubts you. Let them sit back and be proven wrong. Let them watch you put them in their place. Stay strong and good luck!"
leaves,feow0he,t3_eq60c5,1579306616.0,"I can definitely understand your perspective. I had a similar experience minus Tourette‚Äôs, in that I had fooled myself into believing this habit solved so many problems. With me, it almost felt like it alleviated my ADD and anxiety. It doesnt. It makes my thoughts harder to catch and remember, and I tend to act on emotion more. Basically, all the bad stuff amplified. At the same time, there is still something I truly enjoy about it, even knowing how good it isnt. 

To further your metaphor, breaking even a toxic relationship can be hard. You leave the comfort and security you‚Äôve known for so long in favor of potentially better circumstances, so to speak. My only advice is to take it one day at a time, and just remember why you want or need to quit.  There will come a time when you find not only peace, but happiness without it. It may take some time and a few slips, but it sounds like you are on a solid path. We are gaining a lot by quitting, even for a long enough time to clear our heads. Its honestly funny how sobriety changes your perspective on so much. 

Final note: Here‚Äôs one way to look at it. So it doesnt help your tics like you thought; its not serving its purpose. So you dont need it like you thought you did. So you‚Äôre not chained to it.  If your medicine doesnt work, its time to find something else that does (so to speak). 

Best of luck to you!"
leaves,felkztl,t1_felishu,1579224693.0,"Exactly my point. That‚Äôs something I have heard from quite a few people, probably on or around this sub. Furthermore, even the ‚Äúmental‚Äù (I think physiological would apply more here) withdrawals are brutal in themselves sometimes. I had some rough anxiety that caused borderline anxiety attacks for the first few days. Fortunately, that subsided fairly quickly. But I have been seeing more studies coming out detailing how marijuana can affect you in the short and long term."
leaves,fejvvws,t1_fejd4i5,1579187055.0,"To an extent, it is absolutely physically addictive. Try quitting cold turkey and you will see. Difficulty sleeping, night sweats, hot flashes; those are not mental withdrawals. Your body does adjust to a chemical you ingest for so long. Speaking as someone who has smoked for over a decade, there is plenty of evidence to back this up. If you dont believe me, try putting a post on here claiming that its not addictive and see what the responses are. Trust me, you will likely be surprised. While this addiction does pale in comparison to alcohol, heroin, or even nicotine, its absolutely a bitch to conquer. 

OP, good for you! That is an amazing victory and I am truly happy for you! Always keep that feeling close to you and you will be just fine. Way to go my friend, and best of luck going forward. I live hearing these motivational stories! Just made my morning!"
leaves,fdzsxcf,t3_enfakm,1578795043.0,"That is an awesome win for you, so way to go! I felt the same way when I smashed my bowl. I broke it to kill temptation, but I realized after the fact I basically minced the glass with several hits of a hammer. The release if the hold this stuff has on you can be...incredible. 

I think we both (as well as many others) still have a long road ahead. But maybe it wont be quite as bad as it seemed one day, long ago. 

Again, congrats! Stay strong my friend!"
leaves,fdp0c4p,t3_emannv,1578616987.0,"First off, congrats on the decision and making it so far. I‚Äôm on the same journey (most of us are), and its definitely not as simple as some make it out to be. Personally, my habit is of ten or so years, so I can feel some of your struggle. Making it to day 4 is amazing, so good for you. I am very happy for and proud of you!

In my experience, the first week has been the hardest by far. I‚Äôm on about week 3 (I think; its been hard to keep track but I know its at least that far), and I have had the occasional smoke, but still far less than before. From my experience, if you can make it through that first week, you will feel much stronger. 

Its a rough journey, but even so far for myself it already feels worth it. It seems like you have some great motivation, and its definitely a good idea to have those thoughts journaled. It helps clear up some of the static when things get hard. 

Again, I am very happy for and proud of you. You are definitely not alone either. Best of luck!"
leaves,fdenabl,t3_ekwptm,1578342614.0,"This is awesome to hear. Congratulations on a major milestone. I am in week two right now, and though a lot has subsided I am still feeling the aggravation and occasional anger. Overall I do feel better, but I am looking forward to that tike where my mind is less consumed by the urge. Thanks for the motivation! It truly helps. 

Good luck to you all! I have faith we can all conquer this demon!"
leaves,fdcb5er,t1_fdc93ka,1578270760.0,"I feel your pain. I quit a couple of weeks ago, and that boredom/lackluster perspective can be rough. If it helps, after about a week it starts to get better. Personally, a part of me still wants to smoke, but I had to realize I am not as good high as I am sober at many tasks (especially school). Just try to take it slow, and know this is DEFINITELY temporary. 

For perspective, I am 33 and have smoked daily for a decade or more.  But having made it even to the second week is a pretty awesome feeling. 

Good luck! üçÄ"

It honestly amazes me, I was so hateful to myself a couple of hours ago. Now, I feel motivated. I am ready to knock this shit out and live. Because now I see how little I have lived for so long. 

Thank you times a million for the encouragement. That makes my heart smile, and gives me a much needed boost."
leaves,fd31n04,t1_fd30k5o,1578153851.0,"Thank you. Your kind words mean a lot, and I appreciate that. Funny enough, I was just talking to my wife the other day about starting a workout routine again. I felt much better when I did, and without smoking taking up my time and energy, I think that would be a great idea. It feels so much better to know I am not alone, and maybe this isnt as had as I felt at first. Thanks again my friend"
leaves,fd30pm9,t1_fd2z7wk,1578153651.0,"I love that perspective and idea. When I was quitting cigarettes, it always got to me that people would react to a slip-up with this: 

‚ÄúOh, you smoked? Well you just started over then‚Äù

That is the most destructive idea to have. So because I slipped up, the progress prior is gone? 

Youre right; I am going to think long and hard about why this happened and why I dont want it to happen again. It really wasnt worth it. I didnt feel better, I damn sure dont now, and it just seems pointless.  

I told my best friend yesterday I hadnt smoked in a week. He almost shit a brick. For years I have dreamed of being strong enough to do this. Im just trying to remember a slip up does not equate to failure. A couple of months ago this would have spiraled me into giving up and buying more. I refuse to do that now, so I suppose that is progress. 

I suppose it also helps that my dealer in particular is possibly the most unreliable around. Just the thought of gaining more anxiety by waiting on it, hoping today is the day, and knowing when I get it that it will be gone soon...how the hell have I lived that way for so long? I‚Äôm seeing now it was inly survival. 

I‚Äôm ready to live again. Maybe for the first time in my life."
leaves,fd2yjzd,t1_fd2s8mu,1578152973.0,"Thank you. There is a lot of truth in your post. I tend to expect the most out of myself, and when I fall short I feel like a failure. In my mind, its either 100% or nothing. I know thats not right, and I am trying to learn to accept progress as success. I‚Äôve been reflecting a lot and I honestly feel like I did learn something from this. I one thing is for sure: I dont want to wake up with that sinking feeling again. I havent felt that bad for a long time, so I am using that as motivation to do better."
leaves,fd2xjzk,t1_fd2vtdc,1578152713.0,"First off, congratulations on Day 3! That is awesome! For me, that is when a lot of it started to get easier. Thats a great accomplishment. 

Thanks for the perspective. To put things in the right light, I took two hits yesterday (while drunk, no doubt part of the problem; lesson learned). When I was smoking regularly, I would take upwards of 12-15 hits a day (3-4 bowls/day, about 4ish hits each). In the past week, I have had 5 hits: three a week ago and two last night. 

Funny thing is, I am dealing with that all-too familiar alcohol hangover, and I really dont want any weed. Used to weed made it all better. Now I can only think about how disoriented I would be. 

I truly appreciate the encouragement. I have leveled myself out a little this morning, and I am seeing things a bit differently now. Thank you so much. 

Again, way to go and good luck. This is why I love this sub and all the subscribers."
leaves,fd2mu7g,t3_ejw03m,1578149469.0,"I can relate to your thoughts by far. The first few days at least, I was filled with inexplicable rage. Why do I have to quit? All because the government cant pull its head out of its ass? Are there not bigger worries? I have gone down the rabbit hole a few times as I came out of the haze and start to absorb the world around me, instead of what I wanted to believe it was. 

Its normal. You are getting a slap in the face that things are not what they seemed. That can be hard. But remember, the worlds problems are not your own. I truly respect your desire to be a part of more than yourself, to change circumstances for the better of everyone. But if you look at every problem and try to find a solution, you will bog yourself down. 

As previous comments have said, pick a battle that matters to you and fight. Fight tooth and nail for what you know to be true. The anger you have is justified, and can be constructive if channeled. 

Also, allow yourself some time to feel. Breathe. Take it all in. Dont just accept the anger, but question why its there. Be curious about your feelings. It can be really scary, but it can also be enlightening. Anger is normal, but its usually from something we are not confronting (at least in a case such as this). 

Lastly, the anger will pass. I promise. I speak from experience. A couple of days to a week ago, I wanted to hit, break and smash everything in sight. I‚Äôve noticed the anger is slowly melting, and when it comes its a bit easier to deal with. 

For what its worth, you are a good person for being so angry for others. Maybe if the world learned from that example then we could find some semblance of peace. Good luck my friend. You are not alone at all. Like all of us here, you got this."
leaves,fd2krye,t1_fd2kdfu,1578148639.0,"Thats a good way of looking at it. I still know so many people who wont recognize the issue not just with weed but drugs in general. Fortunately, they are not active in my life so that makes it a bit easier. Thats another great way of looking at it"

Funny thing is, a couple of days ago I couldnt stop crying because I felt so bad in general; I kind of just wanted to smoke to make it go away. Now? I feel like shit, sure.

offmychest,fcgip44,t1_fcgar1r,1577640465.0,"I get that. I cant tell you how many times I told my wife ‚ÄúI dont know why you waste your time on me. I am way too broken. I am a lost cause. Etc‚Äù. We would fight until I could justify to her why she should leave me. 

She finally broke me one day. She told me how much she hurt through my pain. I realized there was one thing worse than death: a life without her. That if she really did leave, I wouldnt have any reason to avoid that mistake. It scared the shit out of me. 

I wouldnt say to threaten leaving by any means. But maybe tell him how much you hurt with his pain. Tell him in a time of calm, when he is more receptive to hear it. And make sure he knows you love him, and thats why your heart breaks. At worst, even tell him that you dont want to leave, but you cant keep suffering by watching him suffer when there is nothing you can do to stop it. 

Though it seems to be highly stigmatized, therapy is an AMAZING option. I have been able to identify so many issues by just talking to someone who is not personally invested. 

It sounds like he is truly lucky to have you; someone who cares so much. I wish you both the best."

And if you are wondering, just from my opinion, you are a good mom as I am a good dad. If for nothing else than we have recognized an issue and decided to face it head on. One day, they will appreciate that.

One common thread I have noticed with many of us is that we DIDN‚ÄôT get that support when we were younger. Hence this habit that is so damn hard to shake. 

I say this to say I respect you for your mentality, and I appreciate you saying this. I am on Day 2 right now, and yesterday I broke down crying because I felt so overwhelmed and downright worthless.

offmychest,f9bv1kb,t3_e4glz8,1575216531.0,"Just from these posts, its obvious you re not alone. However, please understand I dont detract from your pain. Being a man, I will never have the joy of carrying or birthing my own child. Likewise, I therefore cannot pretend I understand what you are going through. However, I did have the horror of watching my wife suffer with this multiple times. 

I remember holding her while she cried, trying to convince her she was not ‚Äúbroken‚Äù or ‚Äúfailing her purpose as a woman‚Äù (for the record, NO woman is failing because of such a horrible tragedy). It was especially hard holding my pain back to let hers flow, to let the anguish flood out and away, to take what little off of her I could. 

I have also seen what a toll holding this in can take on a woman, on a person of any kind. This can build resentment on both sides. Your friend will figure out something is wrong. She may mistake it as jealousy, when in reality you have a perfectly legitimate reason to feel the way you do. I respect your mentality SO greatly, I really do. But if this person is your friend, which she obviously is, give her the chance to be that friend.  I understand not wanting to take away from her happiness. But its like letting me walk in the room and talk about my badass job while not telling me you just lost yours and are facing bankruptcy. I would feel like a world class jerk, and a job does not compare to this. 

You are a good friend, and bless you for it. Give her the chance to do the same, when you feel the time is right. I guarantee the guilt will hit her hard if she finds out she has been pushing this on you and bragging about her joys while you deal with an incredible tragedy. You feel like you owe her, but she owes you too. Thats what friendship is, after all. 

Best if luck to you, my heart pours all positivity to you, and please know you are so far from alone."
