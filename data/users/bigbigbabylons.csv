YouShouldKnow,femhhp8,t3_epgcr8,1579255794.0,"Honestly this whole thread just makes me think you guys are getting drunk and ordering random shit and forgetting.

Also something that might help, you can have multiple amazon accounts with the same email on the different sites such as .co.uk or .com. I ordered a bunch of stuff and spent days puzzled as to why I couldn't find it in my orders until I switched sites and realised, otherwise theres was zero indication I had placed the order."

YouShouldKnow,fejjnqi,t1_fejgj77,1579177049.0,Doesnt Amazon have like one of the best return policies? Like couldn't you just literally post them back with a free returns label no questions asked and get refunded and be done with it?

Did you get this near Manchester by any chance?"

uktrees,fcjw9cl,t3_ehcdtp,1577707784.0,"Honestly theres several options, space bucket is neat but yields aren't great and you'll want to upgrade instantly (it's what I did). A small tent would be better. For the light if you want cheap I'd go with a blurple or CFL/T5 light but your yields will be meh.  Quantum Boards are amazing but a bit pricey still even when ordering from Alibaba. Best budget light in my opinion is a 600w dimmable hps, you can dim it down to 250watts and it creates a pretty nice temp/environment for your plants for most of year and your yields will be insane compared to any other similarly priced light. 

My recommendation setup - a 80cmx80cm or 1mx1m cheapo tent with decent zips (£40ish), a hps with digital ballast kit (£70) and a small fan to circulate air (£15). Add to this your preferred pots, medium ,nutes and seeds and you're good to go. 1 plant will have lots of space to stretch but you could definitely fit a couple in there to increase yields. Only downside with this is theres no heat control, so you need to be able to reduce the temps in the room during summer somehow (I open a window)"

Documentaries,fcigu2f,t3_egzqdf,1577662322.0,"Thoroughly enjoyed this, thanks for posting. I liked the old school style of the monologues with the actors looking directly at the camera. 

I thought the two guys they followed were going to punch that Japanese prison guard who showed up at the dock and claimed only 1 prisoner died from sickness, thought it was pretty appalling."
MealPrepSunday,fcalbfi,t1_fc9ge0t,1577571486.0,I remember we never learned to cook rice at school and the reasoning was it doesnt keep after being cooked for long before becoming dangerous. I think in meal prepping you might want to avoid rice
movies,fc6qozn,t3_egdtej,1577487053.0,"Watched this movie after all the recommendations but honestly couldn't get through it, took a couple of sittings. I wasn't a fan and found it a bit all over the place and a bit too ""artsy"" for my liking. There's a couple of brutal scenes but other than that I thought it was incredibly boring."
uktrees,fbxjkda,t3_eezw05,1577190555.0,Pretty! What lights you using?
