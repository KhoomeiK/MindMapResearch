i work an office job, and will still get 5k a day atleast. just do those battles and call it a day unless you want to walk more.

end of the day, its people upset they can't just drive around to play like every other aspect of the game."

LPOTL,ffx3il7,t1_ffv89i0,1580316974.0,"Yeah, im really happy they're doing redo episodes, but i hope they space them out a decent amount"
