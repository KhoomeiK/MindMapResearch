dogs,ff396r3,t1_ff33zkw,1579536644.0,"Exactly this. Training, and in the meantime a more solid crate or reinforcing the existing crate. If that's not something you have the resolve for or are financially able to deal with, \*return the dog\*. Don't just let it run away."
dogs,ff1q44v,t1_ff1iqmy,1579483690.0,"...you think it's hilarious that instead of training and/or crating the dog, your mother continually put him in a position where he was running away? Then when she got fed up she allowed him to run away \*again\* and potentially get injured/killed instead of just surrendering him?"
BackpackingDogs,feigyzi,t3_epbuwn,1579138301.0,If she's off leash I would definitely have her wear a vest. Even if I'm hiking dogs on leash I usually have one or two in a vest plus I wear my own. Rule number one of hiking: don't get dead :\\
OpenDogTraining,feiecvo,t3_ep8f5t,1579136541.0,"If her nose isn't to the ground she can't hoover anything up. I would practice a more structured walk where her focus is on you rather on sniffing for stuff to eat. Work on engagement and getting her to focus on you rather than her surroundings. If you see something on the ground practice and reward a ""leave it"" command. She doesn't need to be sniffing for the whole walk, but you can always release her to sniff and do her thing once you know an area is free of trash."

dogs,fcvif3g,t1_fcvc6lu,1578002752.0,"This. My foster photographs well and it's been a pain in the butt for me - no one reads his bio but apply to adopt him because ""omg he's so handsome"" and ""he has such kind eyes."" Yes, he is handsome. He also needs some intensive training and confidence building. I'm sure OP has done their research, and congrats to them on their new dog, but comments like ""oh you can just tell x and y"" based off a picture are wildly inaccurate."
OpenDogTraining,fcgylh4,t3_eh98zt,1577645377.0,"Some shelters will allow a foster to adopt situation, where you can take the dog on a trial basis to see how he/she settles in and does. Alternatively, many shelters and rescues try to place dogs in foster homes to get more information about the dogs and help match them with appropriate adopters!"
OpenDogTraining,fcanbqi,t3_egwb3g,1577572667.0,"My dog is half hound, the struggle is real. The ecollar has been a literal lifesaver for us! Definitely look into Larry Krohn and layer low level ecollar work over your existing training foundation - there are probably trainers in your area who can help with this. My dog recalls without the ecollar pretty reliably now, but she still wears it on hikes because it gives me peace of mind knowing I have an invisible leash on her if we see some super distracting novel thing, like a porcupine or something."
OpenDogTraining,fc0luxx,t3_efivc0,1577294070.0,"I would mark when you're closer to her so she doesn't have a chance to step off. If you're far enough away that she does step off, I would put her back on place before giving her the reward."
