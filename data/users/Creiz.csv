You say Diversity is code word. And seeing what I see over in these subs, like the -inaction ones, I don't blame you for putting up that meaning, because honestly it really does appear to be that. 

On the clown subs, Diversity has a completely different meaning. They're going to say it means ""inclusiveness"" but we all know it really means ""bait"". 

But for people like me, who is a target, I mean, when both you and the clowns talk about Diversity, you actually mean Us. The non White or the women or the gays. I see that and I'm like ""Dude. You're actually bitching about a fucking woke asstard doing exactly what you're doing to us."" 

Imagine someone punching you in the face then you turn around and punch somebody else in retaliation.

>Also, men are men and women are women.

Agreed. 

>Crime stats are valid.

But they're skewed. That's another thing you don't want to either see or you willfully ignore it. Yes, the numbers are valid.

But you never try to understand ***why*** these numbers are like that. When I say ""Of course Blacks are criminals, White people actively hindered their development."" You think I'm talking about you. Or Kevin or Josh. 

***NO***. You guys are mostly cool. Sure there are ""elements"" but we all know everybody got those. 

I'm talking about the government, the police, banks, real estate, WallStreet™. I'm talking about the people in Power™, those who run the for Profit prisons and the Judges and Lawyers in their pockets, those who run the hospitals, those who did everything in their power to keep my people down, ignorant and poor. 

All of this ""White People Genocide"" Bullshit is new to you. You don't know how deep this rabbit hole goes. And trust me, it goes **DEEP**™. 

When you'll start to actually feel the ramifications and consequences, when you'll be denied housing or jobs and everyone else will say ""Dude, shut up you're White you can't be discriminated."" when it's exactly what happened, you'll understand. 

It's already fucking starting. Fucking Goldman Sachs, you read the thread. It's already live in SanFran and Portland. 

You're seeing this shit unfolding and you're still oblivious because those fucking clowns from the left say ""We like Blacks"" and you, you probably believe that the answer to that is ""Well, fuck Blacks"". Maybe because if you say ""yea son, Blacks are cool"" you're gonna be seen as a SJW from the left. 

So I'm here trying to tell you that it's bullshit. Accepting minorities, women and the Gays isn't going to make you ""soft"" or a clown from the Left. If you guys were more accepting of us, I guarantee you that more of us would jump ship. 

We're not that different, you and us. Most of us are ideologically aligned with you. If we sit down around a fire, grill some meat and crack open some beers and have a good talk, you'd probably find yourself agreeing to a lot of our shit. 

It's just that holy shit, man. It's wasteland for us out here. Every little thing happens and it's full on ""Despite 13"" ""mUh DiVeRsItY"" ""Those Savages"" ""Eugenics"" ""Slavery didn't exist"" ""Discrimination isn't real"" and other bullshit like that. 

Of course we're going to stay away. It's normal. I doubt you post on FragileWhiteRedditor because you're probably going to get buried alive. Well, that's kinda how I'm feeling when I'm here.

I say this because the Japanese devs are a bit iffy on [CaliSony because they don't offer support in Japanese](https://nintenfan.com/video-game-news/sony-censorship-forcing-japanese-devs-submit-english-content-reviews.html), [the whole censorship thing](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2018/10/japanese_developer_sheds_more_light_on_sony_censorship_scenario), [the fact that Japanese consumers are all playing on their phones](https://soranews24.com/2017/09/21/japanese-console-game-market-shrinks-to-nearly-one-third-its-size-ten-years-ago/), and [Nintendo throwing shade](https://www.spieltimes.com/news/nintendo-against-censorship/).

""Weeb Games"" are the butter of Consoles, like it or not. The ""Bread"", big games like Call of Duty and FIFA are multiplatform so nobody cares about which console they are, but games like HyperDimension Neptunia, or the smaller studios who can only develop on one console at a time were the ones who convinced gamers to buy a console. And Sony moving away from that core demographic just handed them all to Nintendo on a silver platter.

A Black guy gets canceled for Wrongthink™? People here are saying ""Ah he deserves it. Despite 13, yada yada.""

I don't blame them, though. It's fighting an uphill battle. IDPOL has seeped way too deep in our lives that people are way too jumpy when they read a differing opinion. It's much easier to accept the echo chamber than to be challenged into thinking and probably have to change some of your stance and recognize there is a problem. 

Problem is, Pro-Woke looks good. ""Hey! We like trans people! We like Gays! We like Women! We like Blacks! We like Asians! We like Pedos! Come on! We're Inclusive!"" and they will rabidly destroy anything that seems like wrongthink ""Trans should at least shave their beards"" ""**HOW DARE YOU, BIGOT!**"" but low key? Not even them would follow through with what they say they ""defend"". 

An example: It's an anecdote, thing I observed through my life so take it with a grain of salt. 

Most White people I saw miscegenating with Latinas here in my country (Dominican Republic) are of the Conservative, non Woke type. The people who are supposed to hate us. These people come to my country, learn Spanish enough to be able to hold conversations, they marry our women and they stay with them for like the rest of their lives. 

Compare that to the Pro-Woke: They'd drop on their knees to suck your dick but the moment you have you back turned they'll stick a blade to your back. 

Real life is completely different than what the media wants you to see. Both the woke and the anti-woke live in a little bubble of their own, they think the world centers on them and their surroundings, completed by some kind of skewed statistics and studies, that the experiences of other people aren't valid because they haven't experienced it themselves. 

We all really need to take a massive chill pill. We're looking at things way too narrowly and all that does is just reinforce the same problems dividing us much further again and again."

Imagine for example you're Chinese and you go into a sub that is supposed to be about things you enjoy being destroyed and all you see ""Fuck the Chinese."" ""Chinese are shit"" ""Those communists are all the same"", etc. Lumping the hypothetical Chinese you in with the actions of the Chinese government. Or maybe imagine you're Japanese and all you see it ""Yeah Japanese lul they're all pedos and rapists"" or any other variation of the same memes. 

For me? It's all the ""Despite..."", ""mUh DivErsiTy"", ""Blackwashing"", etc. and everytime I say ""Guys it's not us it's the woke 'tards"" I get downvoted to oblivion, insulted, told I am a SJW... Seriously, man? Me, a SJW? With a flair like mine?

Guys. Heed my advice. Prostitutes exist. Go fuck a bitch. Do it. The first time is always the most difficult and awkward, after 2 or three bitches, it's like you opening your favorite game and kicking ass. 

Take care of your sexual urges so you don't get roped in with less-than-average pussy. If you're satisfied sexually, you have a clearer view of women bullshit and you can make better decisions. Plus, it comes with the benefit that you won't need nor feel the urge to be in relationships and shit. 

If prostitution is illegal in your country, sometimes risks are worth taking. Make sure you call a reputable ""agency"", or a reasonably priced girl. Too cheap and they come with problems. Too expensive and it's not worth it, imho. Average priced (150~300 an hour), those girls are clean, take care of themselves and are pros. You'll be well taken care of. 

If you think 150$ is expensive for an hour, sex don't last that much. after warm up, you'll be done in 15, nut and all, satisfied and ***it's still cheaper than having a girlfriend.***
