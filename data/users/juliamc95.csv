We have a strong feeling of connection to our language, Catalan, and we appreciate our traditions, like the human towers (castellers), the correfoc, and the national dance (sardana). Our national day is the 11th of September, where we usually demonstrate cheerfully. As for our values, we tend to appreciate hard work and effort. Most Catalans identify as Europeans as well.

I don't know, it is quite hard to describe a culture and identity. Feel free to hit me up if you want to ask me any questions."
