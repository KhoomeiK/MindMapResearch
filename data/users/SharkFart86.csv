I can choose to speak in a lower or higher register than I normally do, add focal fry or other forms of voice modulation, etc. We may know what sound their vocal chords make at full relaxation and air is pushed through it but that doesn't mean we have any idea how this person actually sounded when speaking.

pics,ffep59n,t1_ffe9d4w,1579858395.0,"You could order leaner cuts like filet mignon. The only downside to filet mignon in my opinion (aside from it being typically expensive) is that it's a naturally less flavorful cut because of it, but it's very tender which kind of makes up for it. And many times filet will come with butter on it as well, which makes up for the lack of fat in the meat.

I personally tend to order filet mignon cooked medium (rather than my usual medium rare for other cuts) because it's naturally a super tender cut of meat and also pretty thick, so below medium the meat can be a little ""gooey"" which bugs me out."

todayilearned,ff2ijrm,t1_ff2fvqb,1579507681.0,"Generally the health issues don't start, or at least don't become noticeable, until well into being addicted to smoking. And, contrary to popular belief, people do enjoy smoking beyond satiating the addictive craving. So even though it's dumb, people start smoking, become addicts, and continue smoking even though it's ""bad for them"". They put it out of their mind the same way many of us do with poor diet decisions. We ""know"" fast food is bad to eat regularly, yet we continue to do it because it's what we want and we feel fine (for now).

Smoking is an especially difficult addiction to overcome, but not solely because of the nicotine. Smoking is as much a chemical addiction as it is a repetitive habit. One pack a day is more than one per hour all day every day. That's more often than most habitual nail biters bite their nails. When you develop a habit of that frequency it's very very hard to stop, and added as an extra little bonus hurdle, nicotine is a physically addictive substance.

And on top of THAT, smoking in a way becomes part of how that person defines themself. It started out as a rebellious act and now it's part of who they are. People don't *want* to quit because it's hard, and they don't want to never be able to smoke again. They like having a smoke when drinking, or after a big meal, or with their morning coffee, or after sex. They don't want to lose that. And if they quit they can't have those good smoking moments.

The best thing anyone can ever do to avoid all of this is to never start smoking in the first place, because quitting is a bitch."

The same change may rise in siblings simultaneously but at that point we're talking semantics.

I get what you're saying and I don't necessarily disagree with that perspective but the actual mechanism of change starts with random genetic mutations which happen at the individual level. At no specific point does something go from Species A to Species B. 

It's like.. take a small pile of dirt (Species A), and then add one grain of dirt to it per day, some days add more frequently like 3 a day, some one every 3 days. After a very long time you've got a mountain (Species B). But when did it make the switch from pile to mountain? Every single grain of dirt was equally important in the transition, so none really qualify as a ""missing link"" between the two. *We* see a difference between the pile and mountain that has categorical value, but as far as the process is concerned they're just two arbitrary points on a constantly changing spectrum."

The Geralt stuff is years before that (decades at first), sort of little short stories that give you insight into his motivations and how certain things lead to the present situation, and his connection to Yen and more importantly Ciri.

The Yen stuff is also in the past until she and Geralt meet later, then those timelines (Geralt's and Yen's) line up.

television,fefzvuu,t1_fefpva5,1579071031.0,"Eh... IMO I think there's legitimate criticisms for the show but I wouldn't go as far as calling it bad. Overall I liked it a lot, but some of the acting was a little off. I think the actress who played Yen was good and Henry Cavill really nailed Geralt's personality, but some of the other actors came off as bad, or even over-acting (like Calanthe).

The pacing was a little weird too IMO but I feel like it found a better stride in the last few episodes. 

I do feel like the show didn't do a very good job on selling us on the world itself and how it all works, it did feel like it expected you to already be familiar with the world and the show was a supplementary treat for already-fans.

But again overall I enjoyed it and I'm excited for S2. MANY times shows don't really find a good rhythm and voice until the second season, so I'm hoping my little gripes get smoothed out then.

Though I wouldn't mind if the NPCs would like complain about it or something. ""Please sir we need that to survive..."" kind of stuff.

But otherwise, taking other's belongings without consequence is kind of RPG tradition and to me is just part of how those games work. Skyrim's thing where you had to sneak to steal was cool because it usually wasn't very hard to do, and on top of that you never really *needed* to steal other people's stuff to get by (unless it was quest essential). 99% of the time there wasn't much valuable or rare stuff to be stolen from NPCs, they'd just have like cheese and cabbage and stuff."
