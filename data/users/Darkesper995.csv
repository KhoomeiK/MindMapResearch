SuicideWatch,ffdhaie,t1_ffdg99p,1579820848.0,"I cant care for my personal needs. I need a better job, cant get that because i dropped out of high school from the stress and anxiety. Oh, get a GED? Well, dont have the time. I have fucking bills to pay, and im failing at that. I dont have transportation, everything is snowes over and i have to walk to work, trudging through snow with my shitty uncomfortable shoes.

I cant care for myself, the system fucks you over and theres no way out when youre a constant fuck up like me. I... think i understand what you're saying, but i cant be fixed. Theres no fixing my situation. Not unless i SOMEHOW fall into money."
SuicideWatch,ffdepqi,t1_ffd9c9v,1579819313.0,"Yep. You get it. They dont care about you, they just want to gouge you. Kick you when you're already down. Tell me, slashing your wrists, how much did it hurt? I live alone, can easily get a razor or a knife and enough alcohol to maybe numb the pain. Probably how im going to go after my birthday in June, honestly.

Unless of course im pushed to the brink sooner than that."
SuicideWatch,ffd90z9,t3_eswla3,1579815787.0,"My question now is, how hard is it to get a gun? Hanging would take too long and theres nothing to hang myself off of, North Dakota is too flat to jump... or hang... guess i can always poison myself."
SuicideWatch,ffcuw4d,t1_ffcluwe,1579807749.0,"I know they're my friends.

I know they'd ""miss me"" and i do care about them, i want them to succeed but i also dont care that me dying would hurt. All we can do is say words to each other. About how they like me being around, how much i matter but its all just words. They cant improve my situation, only numb the pain ever so slightly for mere seconds before i remember who i am, where i am, where my life is going and how theres nothing i can do to fix it.

Its been like this for years, ever since i found my dad bleeding from the aneurysm on the kitchen floor. Nothing brings me true happiness. Even hanging out with them has lost its luster. Theyre all internet friends anyway...

i went on a tangent, i guess... i just hate that all they can say is ""it gets better"" when i know it doesnt and i resent them for it."

Also i sleep the vest when ive veen drinking. Granted i do have moderation, but... i drinl because i work."

SuicideWatch,fddb3sa,t1_fdd02tr,1578303496.0,"And half the time the anridepressants dont fucking work which, in my case at least, show you the truth of reality.

People, unless they feel the same as you do which the ones in power dont feel at all, dont give a single solitary fuck about you. Youre just a cog, a piece of the machine...

If your previous post is anything to go by, going straight to bare ass might be too strong of a start. Dont burn yourself out immediately... cause if i had to guess, it'd burn."

""Execute Smile.EXE""


It does nothing, it has no meaning but if i dont smile i could get talked to."

SuicideWatch,fcn9ziu,t3_ei1lvc,1577807041.0,"I dont tell anyone more than just paasing jokes anymore. Had a close friend stick me in the emergency room of a hospital in chicago for at least 5 days (no hospital would take me cause of my out of state insurance) before i was stuck in a mental hospital for a week where all i did was play gin rummy with the other patients and slept on the worlds most uncomfortable bed.

All against my will. So... when i go and do the deed, no one will know."
