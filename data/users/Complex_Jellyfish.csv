I worked in a clothes store. It was ridiculous the amount of men who would be reluctant to come in with their wives because 'it was a shop for women' (never mind that we did sell men's clothing too). 

So many men who wouldn't even touch the clothes until they'd confirmed with me that the items were for men. 

So many men who had to get the shop assistant to do up zips on the back the dress the wife is trying on because he ""doesn't understand"" women's clothes. 

So many men who thought they were being hilarious when they asked me if we had a skirt/dress/etc in their size and then get offended when i told them yes (""I was only joking love, bloody hell."")

So many men who when asked by their wives to look after her handbag whilst she was in the changing room would either immediately give it to me to look after or would have to loudly tell any other bloke in the shop ""It's not mine, it's the wife's"" because obviously everyone would think they were gay if they were seen holding a handbag.
