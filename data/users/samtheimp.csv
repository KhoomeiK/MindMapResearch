offmychest,ffctejg,t3_esswv6,1579806882.0,"I had a kid with my abuser when I was 15 and he has 21. He spent time in prison for it, and although I loved him with all my heart at the time, in hindsight he was a horrible person with an attraction to young girls. If he REALLY loves you he WILL wait until your of age. If he wont its 100% about sex. If you cant find a girl your own age you need to grow up first. And if you whine about me saying that then your a kid lover too"
polyamory,ffca92r,t3_esrumm,1579795075.0,"I have 2 bfs and one of them is interested in someone but not dating yet. (They dated in the past and she's really nice) I thought I would feel weird and I did at first. I was always thinking I was hurting feelings, and asking them constantly if this was ok, giving them outs. Stuff like that. After a while I had to remind myself that if I'm ok with someone dating someone else, why should they have a problem? We've all been pretty grown up in my opinion. I know it's from the opposite point of view but I hope it helps."
BDSMAdvice,ffb71bp,t3_esjrtx,1579753517.0,"I have a dom and a sub. If my dom demanded that we all have a 3some, I'd break it off with him immediately and I'm head over heels for him. That would be enough for me. If you want to give them the benefit of the doubt then put up boundries now, if the boundaries aren't heeded I'd leave and never look back."
BDSMcommunity,ff3jm66,t3_erfc1e,1579542445.0,My ex bit down on my shoulder so hard I screamed. What surprised me is it was a pleasure scream. Had a bruise for weeks. Started diving deeper after that.
BDSMAdvice,few7mnr,t3_eqfywj,1579406500.0,You over thinking it. Im a switch.  If they like to play with you then they are getting something too.
asktrp,ferwrja,t1_ferpqpy,1579359114.0,Yes
offmychest,fep6uqc,t3_eq2qd2,1579313456.0,"My grandmother (who was pretty much my mom and raised me) killed herself in the next room when I was 14. I struggled with that for a while. Wanted to kill myself too. Then I heard a quote. ""It doesn't end the pain it just passes it to the next person"" (I messed it up but you get the gist) I ended up staying alive out of respect for her and the people I love. Think of how they would feel. If you feel even a twinge of sadness, you have your answer.

Edit: someone else said something in this thread about vitamin d. It's very true. Been doing it the last few years and it helps with the winter blues and depression in general."
asktrp,feosxom,t1_feo3zyc,1579304944.0,5'8 with a medium frame. I've been told I'm supposed to be 140 or less but I've found that's unhealthy for me. I dropped weight (not by choice but depression) and was 145 and looked like a skeleton. That's my body though. Others are different. Also female if that helps.
asktrp,feof2op,t3_eq7csn,1579299230.0,"Keep it friendly and let her heal and dont let her make you a rebound. Not that it's bad, I had a healthy 5 year relationship that started as rebound and learned alot from him. Be her friend first, and take it slow, but chances are she knows what she wants, and it's s probably you."
asktrp,feo3skn,t3_eq67cp,1579294702.0,"Fats, carbs, and protein helped me! I made it back to 160!! Eat as much as you can!!"
asktrp,fenhll7,t3_eq17gs,1579284859.0,"Well first off... dont call girls ""bitches"" is highly offensive. Second girls dont like being hit on at the gym. It comes off as creepy."
BDSMAdvice,fem2dpl,t3_eptuhr,1579237492.0,"Nope. I had someone from Fet tell me that too. Know what happened? We didnt meet. The more I think of it, I dodged a bullet."
offmychest,fem25yk,t3_epndfj,1579237299.0,Dude that's me but I'm 26 and homeless. I've heard ot gets better in some ways and worse in others. You just cope as best you can.
BDSMcommunity,fecka31,t3_eo96wf,1578975974.0,"You sound so soo much like me. I'm poly and started out with a dom. And I thought I was a straight sub for a while. Then I ended up dating someone else who turns out to be a VERY bratty sub. Using him for my pleasure was so strange at first. My whole life I've been taught to think of others before myself, and suddenly I had someone treating ME that way. It crushed my previous notions of myself and gender roles. Its was really awkward at first but worth it once you get the hang."
BDSMAdvice,fdzvl7c,t3_enbd2d,1578796840.0,My sub has alot of health problems. I'm still learning how to navigate this but it seems the psychological side of it works for him. Letting him know I'm disappointed with how he handled his task.
BDSMAdvice,fdxgl6y,t1_fdxg870,1578768497.0,It's hard at first. Then it gets easier
BDSMAdvice,fdxelpm,t1_fdu8g60,1578768006.0,"You could be a switch like me. My switching is different though. I'm poly and have a sub and dom separately, although I've switched with my sub too. (Doesn't make him my dom, more like telling him to top me) my sub likes pain but that's not the dominant factor. We like the cutesy, sensual stuff. Like head on laps, head pats, telling him he's a good boy, stuff like that. I have retrained him without ropes or force. I once made him stay inside me without moving till I got my enjoyment, and he got his turn when I was done, seeing him struggle with his self control was hot as hell. I dont think that's the term but I call it psychological doming."
offmychest,fdu5sb4,t3_en0lq3,1578728060.0,"I almost didn't read this but I saw dietary aide. That was my favorite job. My story was similar, but she was like my grandma. Were all here on borrowed time but the friends we make along the way is what counts! Glad she had you as a friend :)"
BDSMAdvice,fdu4uky,t3_en4asr,1578727579.0,Try out the gental femdom community here on reddit. It's about the softer side of doming. Alot of cute posts too.
todayilearned,fdu1uml,t1_fdsf2q2,1578726020.0,This whole website is high on drugs
BDSMcommunity,fdr4iar,t1_fdr17l3,1578679343.0,"Men yap just as much. Personal experience. If you dont want to hear someone tell you about their day, find something casual. Having someone get emotionally involved in you when you dont care is one of the crappiest things you can do. Its supposed to be a mutual thing. You tell each other about your days. Maybe you had a girl who you couldn't get a word in edgewise with, if that's true I'm sorry but don't assume all women talk your ear off."
asktrp,fdquixf,t3_empb6o,1578675128.0,Ya she's gonna try and trap you. I've heard this story so many times from so many different men. Run.. so very far...
BDSMcommunity,fdqtzg2,t1_fdqtcdq,1578674834.0,"I wish people like that would save the good subs for the rest of us. It hard enough finding someone as it is, and its heartbreaking when a good boy/girl is wasted on someone who doesn't care about them. :("
BDSMcommunity,fdqt34c,t1_fdqqql4,1578674289.0,"You must not like your sub very much, or listening to her talk. Damn, that's cold as hell."
BDSMAdvice,fdqqbzf,t3_emlulh,1578672603.0,Your doing it right. Unfortunately they aren't. Keep going and you'll find someone!!
TopsAndBottoms,fdnsgb8,t3_em7s9p,1578591914.0,"I used to hate anal until it was done right. (Not saying you should, or that its something to work towards) turns out theres alot of prep and foreplay involved that are what make it enjoyable. I had tried it a few times and hated it everytime. I would get angry if you suggested it even. Then found my dom who takes it slow and makes sure I'm comfortable. Now it's one of my favorite things."
BDSMAdvice,fdklzvm,t3_elqtvi,1578506323.0,Maybe you could be your own dom until your reunited with one? I know it sounds silly but I've heard of other subs doing it for loneliness or stress relief. You could give yourself daily tasks and whatnot too if you like that. I know it's not the same but I hope it helps.
SubSanctuary,fdj7i5f,t3_elnx3n,1578460638.0,"Take time for you right now. It hurts alot I know. I couldn't imagine losing my dom. Try to do something fun, eat ice cream. Watch a silly movie. Everyday will get slightly better than the last until one day you realize it barely hurts anymore. I wish you the best! *hugs*"
BDSMAdvice,fdj72po,t3_eljodo,1578460287.0,Red flag! Red flag! That's a douch thing not a dom or sadist thing.
BDSMAdvice,fdj6ndg,t3_eli33r,1578459935.0,"Another crossdresser here but f2m. My sub is the one that helped me realize who I was and I'm still VERY closeted. Hes always liked fem boys, and I like being one. We took it slow and have been together for a while and I still haven't really been with him as a ""man"" yet, but theres no pressure and we just have fun. Hope this helps."
TopsAndBottoms,fdj659k,t1_fdicb4o,1578459525.0,My dom used a frozen tube of lube on me and waited till it was warm and used me as a lube dispenser. It was the coldest and hottest thing ever to happen to me. We both got a kick out of how different and funny it was too.
gentlefemdom,fdj5tgm,t3_elmdll,1578459261.0,So doing this with my bear of a sub! He LOVES stuff like this and I was looking for ideas!! Thanks!!
polyfamilies,fdj4s7j,t3_el7rrv,1578458437.0,Every days gets just a little bit better. You can do it!
BDSMAdvice,fcnxo61,t3_ehuv5z,1577820465.0,"This is an abusive relationship. No doubt. When I had to leave my abusive ex I saved and hid all my money from them. When I had enough I left, even though we still loved each other. 8 years later and my life is much better without them.Maybe you can find a job under his nose and save up like I did. I'm not saying it will be easy but it will be worth it!!"
BDSMAdvice,fcnx9se,t1_fcm2ctj,1577820257.0,Agreed. 200%
asktrp,fckxy0y,t3_ehpnkl,1577735578.0,"I've had this happen to me before. My ex (M) came fast our 1st time and I took it as a compliment too. Sometimes the excitement can get to you. I think you handled it very well. Next time before you get busy nut beforehand, itll make you last longer."
BDSMAdvice,fcdouru,t1_fcdlplq,1577612110.0,"I didn't think of it from that point of view! I have 2 partners, and they dont date each other either. I believe the term for that is metas. (Being your dating the same person but not each other)"
SubSanctuary,fcd7raz,t1_fcd6c9u,1577607409.0,"I'm in a part time ldr myself. We see each other about once or twice a month, and THATS hard. I can only imagine what's it like for you two."
SubSanctuary,fcd512s,t1_fcd4w9d,1577606437.0,I'd give it a go if you think hes worth it. What do you have to lose?
BDSMAdvice,fcd4t61,t1_fcd0yp2,1577606361.0,"You could just be blunt, if they love you it shouldn't matter. I'm into bdsm and have a poly relationship that my family doesn't approve of but they still love me and are glad when I come by to say hi."

SubSanctuary,fcd3vey,t3_egwt9o,1577606027.0,"Hi! Switch here! I have a dom and a sub who are both male. Dommeing came later with someone who was my friend/love interest for years. Funny enough being a dom took more trust than being a sub did. I was (and still am) constantly checking in to make sure hes ok, and hes always telling me to be meaner. Applying the things I love as a sub to him is challenging but I just have to remind myself that it's what hes loves too. At the end of the day it's about making him a happy sloppy mess. And the best part? Turns out I have more sadist in me than I thought, and have discovered some interesting kinks I have that I didn't even know existed. Do your best, remember what you love about being a sub and apply it, and talk afterwards is the best advise I can give you. Best of luck!"
BDSMAdvice,fcd1rcc,t3_eh2mqv,1577605287.0,They have hand zappers for cheap. Small jolt of electricity. Hurts but not too bad and doesn't leave scars. Fits in your pocket and hand too.

SubSanctuary,fcd0soj,t3_eh2kcn,1577604954.0,"If it's been a year and you haven't met, I could see why hes upset. Id talk to him about it (and whatever problems your having) and make some time to meet."
BDSMAdvice,fcd04fa,t1_fccx5rt,1577604719.0,I was thinking the same exact thing! I'd leave bdsm out of it and focus on the poly side.
gentlefemdom,fccld34,t3_eh07w9,1577599735.0,I like to stroke my subs face when we cuddle. And give him goosebumps.
BDSMAdvice,fcbn2en,t1_fcbky1h,1577588749.0,"Ya I've heard its hit and miss too depending on where you are. I live in the middle of no where, so I never bothered. I wish you the best of luck!!"

BDSMAdvice,fcbjeti,t3_egzxpt,1577587565.0,"Ouch. All I can say as a switch, is that taking care of someone is the subs job too. When I'm a sub I take care of my dom. I'll make them food or just hold them cuz they need that too. It might be hard at first to find a good sub but it's worth the wait."
offmychest,fc3p0rj,t3_eftlkn,1577395041.0,"I used to be big, and now I'm ""skinny"". I've had people who knew me before (when I was big) that see me now and ask if I have an eating disorder, or if I'm on drugs... sigh.. no I had an eating disorder when I was big, and now I'm healthier and dont eat my stress, so telling me I should gain some weight, or eat a sandwich, is very offensive to me. I get it. I know you've tried to tell them but being assertive about it might help. I've gotten to the point where I'm straight up mean when people say that. Yes. I've lost a friend or 2 and a few family members, but I'm happier for it."
BDSMAdvice,fbvlt17,t1_fbts44u,1577132660.0,Also could be a brat. Sometimes they do things like that to get you to dominate them more. Pushing buttons if you will.
