I personally would hate to travel for work. Long days and you don't get paid much more usually. But, if I did, I would ask my SO to come if he could. And if my SO had a travel job, I would really try to go if he was ok with it. Then you could have nights together even if you didn't go to the fancy dinner."

Then last year I was having horrible pelvic pain and bleeding, and they did another ultrasound and found nothing. They did assure me that if it was cancer or something very serious, it would be seen on the ultrasound. I think there's a subreddit where you can post your results and someone can interpret them."

And she is so young. You are doing the right thing by not letting it go, honestly. She may be slow coming around but she could try to do more regular things and that may help as a distraction and give her confidence. Any good job would give her the time she needs off/option to work remotely if the pain is really bad."

washingtondc,fc4cjhr,t3_efx8am,1577412729.0,"I grew up in DC and moved (couldn't live the life I wanted with those prices) but I'm going to answer anyway. I don't live there now but most people I know do. I'm in your age range and have friends making these same decisions. I'm also really familiar with the real estate market.

1. I would stay if I could afford it. Great area with good transit and lots to do.

2. I would skip the condo. The fees are really high. Rent and maybe find a place in the suburbs. If you can eventually live in the city, then awesome. Your plan here sounds spot on.

3.I grew up working class. Never quite made it to the middle. My friends and I felt so free being able to take metro and the bus wherever we wanted to go, and there was no shortage of free activities. I know those with more money really get caught up in the fancy exercise classes and the fine dining, but I didn't need any of that growing up. I went to a public school with the city at my fingertips.

Least favorite is the gentrification and the ultra-rich moving in, and the lack of affordable housing.


4. Do your research!!! Don't discount outside the beltway or the east side. Riverdale and Hyattsville are some gems, and so is Wheaton. Parts of DC that aren't next to metro are good too--the busses are awesome! And respect those who came before you in a gentrifying area."
