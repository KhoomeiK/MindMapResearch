I’m just stating the obvious by saying that you CANT go back in time, and that you can’t undo what you have already done. Whether that doing = thinking, or acting. 

You may be able to repair damages, or provide compensation, for something done in anger, but you can’t travel back in time and “delete” your actions; as if they never happened.

Even thinking a thought can’t be reversed, or controlled really, but we can choose to entertain certain thoughts..."
