thalassophobia,ffb3ven,t1_ffavuon,1579751112.0,"So, funny thing about the Bermuda Triangle...  it is 100% explainable.  Basically, historically, a lot of ship traffic occurred in the area between Bermuda, Miami, and Puerto Rico/ Caribbean.  AND, that ship traffic was relatively short distance and direct. So, 100% of sinkings happened in that known region.  

In contrast, other routes like Newfoundland to UK, or North africa to Brazil, happened over a vast ocean. So whether the boat sunk on day two or day 20 was unknown and thus unattributed to any given area.  So, it was only on these short ""Bermuda Triangle"" jaunts that a sinking could be attributed to a specific area.  

THEN, compound that with the reputation, as this comment proves. Once the reputation was established, people became more aware of the ""phenomenon"" and preconceived or expectation or ""confirmation bias"" creeps in.   

Now, ships sink or have issues all the time, but we don't think twice about it. But, if it happens in the triangle, we make note of it!  We see what we are expected to see. Confirmation bias. We confirm our preconceived notions.  

In summary, outside of hurricane season, the Triangle is abnormally PREDICTIBLE and SAFE!!!  It is a myth!  A glorious fable of the high seas. A fable that sailors and landlubbers alike love to maintain and embellish."

Hello, so I know just enough about photography to make stuff up. Help me out please. Here is the joke post I made:  

So, this is what I posted:  

""Agree 100%.  That looks like a Nikon P-3100b macro enhanced lens.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great lens. But it's best used in low light conditions from a tripod. Unless he preadjusted his O and T levels, that shot is probably going to be severely overexposed resulting in ""grayscale"".  Not to mention the rapid motion and ""kneepod"" shooting position.  

Also, I just made all that up and dont know shit about photography.""  


I was responding to a NSFW post about a creepy cameraman.  I can post link here if allowed. Anyway, there is a grain of truth in my statements, but I don't know how I know. 

1) That lens sounds legit, right?  Don't cameras and lenses have alphanumeric names for some reason?

2) cameras have an adjustable ""level"", yes?  I want to say O level is correct, but I can't imagine what that would stand for. I think it has something to do with light or exposure. L level? E level?  What am I thinking of?

3) overexposed I'm certain is a term. Right?  I was going to say something about contrast, but I switched to ""grayscale"" instead. But, I was thinking ""whiteout"".  Is that a  term?  Or whiteness?  Or white level?  

4) i think i invented/  coined ""kneepod"".  But now I'm thinking that is prob already a term. Is it?  Is that a thing?

Thanks in advance."

>Americans are dying from medically preventable causes! Let's shove that under the rug rather than admitting it's an issue and actually fixing it!


People all over the world die from preventable causes. That is not unique to USA.  And I'm not denying the USA system has problems. Big problems. 


>The HAQ doesn't evaluate theoretical poor people with no access to care. It evaluates the care people actually receive, and calculates how many people died compared to a scenario where they received ideal healthcare. 

DING DING DING!!!  Exactly. I agree 100%. In america, EVERYONE receives care, whether you can afford it or not. In many other counties, the disenfranchised die on the street corner, thus do not negatively influence that stats because care was not provided at all. 

>I think you're absolutely foolish for choosing the US in that situation.

Let us agree to disagree. I appreciate your well educated and poinent arguements. I'd give you silver if I had any to give. You haven't changed my opinion, but you have given me a lot to chew on. Thank you my friend."

>And access to care absolutely *has* to be considered by any reasonable metric, although there can certainly be debate about the weighting. I'm even willing to bet I can get you to agree.

Agreed, access to care should be considered.  But, regardless of weight, this is *still* a metric that punishes the USA.  Let's consider an uninsured poor person. By these reports, this person has ""no access"" to healthcare.  But this simply IS NOT TRUE in America.  By and large, No American is EVER denied basic healthcare.  Rather, that person is treated, billed $100k, and is never expected to pay it!  But the hospital gets to write it off for accounting purposes.   

So the real question is, if you break your arm roller skating or are in a car wreck, do you want to be taken to a fully insured government funded hospital in the UK, or do you want to be taken, uninsured and broke, to an ER in America?  I choose USA hospital every time. 

>If you have to look to one of the most fucked up countries in the world like Venezuela--rather than peer countries like Australia or the UK or France or Germany or Canada--I'm pretty sure I've already won. 

Okay, fair enough, I chose an ""extreme"" example to make a point.  See my arguement above; for me personally my example holds with developed nations too. 


>Again, if you think there's a *better* analysis of healthcare systems I've practically been begging you to share it. Could the problem be that not a single one from a reputable source exists that drives your narrative? Of course, the problem is with the entire world, not your narrative.

I think pretty much all of the analysis is biased.  Tho, I do thank you for the edification and reasonableness of your arguements (e.g. thank you for not evoking ultra small and ultra rich nations like Switzerland, Singapore, Lichtenstein, and Malta...  I think we both agree they should not be used as a barometer in discussions like this).  

Really, my arguement comes down to this:  if you were homeless and broke and uninsured, where would you like your healthcare done?  My answer is USA. Now, if you lived in a mansion, were a millionaire, and had the best insurance, where would you like your healthcare done?  My answer is USA.   

Despite what people say, American hospitals just do not turn away people in need, regardless of ability to pay or even citizenship."
NoStupidQuestions,ff9we88,t1_ff9v44i,1579722967.0,"Nah, we're talking about different things is all.  I got the link to work...  in the title of the report it even lists access of care before quality of care.  It just isn't worth responding to.  These reports all prioritize access as the #1 aim as it is with all nationalized healthcare systems. You know, I'm pretty sure technically all Venezuelans have free access to healthcare too. 100% of the people. Good for them. And I encourage you to travel there for all your healthcare needs.  Meanwhile, I'll stay here in America where the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and Johns Hopkins are consistently rated the three best hospitals on the planet. But yeah, healthcare in America sucks and we need government to fix it for us."

Also it's expensive because they pay taxes, something chinese food places hardly ever do. That is the #1 reason that until Panda Express there wasn't a single franchise Chinese restaurant. It is very difficult to compete in an industry where the competition pays virtually no taxes.

Look, I've done the research. Is true, not all sand is created equally. There are literally 100s of types of ""sands"" and they are useful for different purposes.  This is true.  

Yes, some certain sands in specific places are being depleted. At a very local level, this is concerning for some communities that rely on their local sand for revenue.  

But globally?  It's all eco terrorism, climate hype bullshit. Good news folks!  There is no global sand shortage. Whew. Sleep well tonight."

hockey,fezr5rq,t1_fezmhjk,1579460608.0,"No, he isn't good enough to play on the Bruins. He is good enough to play on at least half the teams in the league...  but not for $6m a year.  That's the real issue."
hockey,feznzm1,t3_eqyu8f,1579459511.0,"I'll add too that Boston is a bit of an anomaly in that their first line consists of three superstars. Many teams don't even have three superstars and if they do, they probably don't all play on the same line.   

Often times it's just chemistry. Some players just don't play as well with some people. No real reason, just that everyone has their own style and some players compliment other players better than others.  It just so happens that Boston's top line and top players play really well together.   But on a different team or in a different system they might be split up.  

Other teams like the Blues, it's a product of strategy and not really having superstars; rather, we have an overabundance of really good players. So, our strategy is to spread the talent around and find the best chemistry. So instead of 1-2-3-4 lines, we kinda have a 2a-2b-2c-3 lineup.  

EDIT: I will add that the NHL is moving towards the Blues style system. Not because of a shortage of superstars but because of the depth of talent available. 30 years ago, all teams basically had 3 good lines and a ""thug line"" of enforcers that could barely skate (obvious exageration).  These days, the 4th line needs to play real minutes with real talent"
hockey,fezli1a,t1_fezfv8v,1579458610.0,Blues did that a lot last year. But I think it was more superstition than anything. I think we did it to send a message to the players right about the same time we started winning so it just kinda stuck.

ColoradoAvalanche,feu9tbl,t1_feu1tg4,1579384567.0,"Btw, you guys have been dicks to me today. I tried to ask some good questions and I got shit upon. I'm pretty disappointed. Avs are my 2nd favorite team in the NHL.  I expected better conversation.   

You, my friend, are awesome. Thank you very very much for your excellent conversation.  Much obliged. üôè  

Also, I actually *do* know the Kroenkes personally and have some pretty cool stories. I was at a party at their house one time, we did some late night hottubbing, and I got woken up early because the maid was shreaking because my buddy was passed out naked on a living room floor!  Ha!  

Another time, Stan got a little pissed off at me because I was talking too much in his box at a Rams game...

Another time, I went to a party at his two story penthouse on the roof of the Ritz in St. Louis...

And another time, I'm sitting in one of Stan's living rooms in his house admiring his trophy case (includes mock Super Bowl trophy and Stanley Cup) and I say, ""Hey, Stan, what did you do with your day with the Cup?""  

So, yeah, I love the Avs more than most of the people here.  Anyway, thanks for being a bro with your actual responses. üëç"

EDIT: okay then...  I guess the downvotes have answered my question.  I do have some great Kroenke stories for you tho. For instance, who here knows what Stan Kroenke did with his ""day with The Cup""?   

I know. I know because he told me."
ColoradoAvalanche,fetvk8n,t1_fettuwt,1579380509.0,"Thanks for the additional info. The megathread is kinda outdated.   I agree with your sentiment though.  There is lots of media that I will gladly pay for, but if you deny me a method to reasonably pay for content....  then, yeah... there are other ways too."
