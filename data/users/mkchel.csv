depression,fefrafj,t3_eophbs,1579062916.0,"You said that you wish you could make this world a better place. That's an admirable wish. I think any human has the potential to do something worthwhile, to feel like we have a place in this world..

I don't know you personally, but as someone who had those thoughts, that there isn't anything worth living for, there's always something to live for or work towards. It could be a small goal like ""I want to become healthier"" or ""I want to own a pet someday"". I know someone who told me they live to play games and work to fund their gaming, and I think that's valid. Even on bad days I try my best to take care of the vessel which is my body so my physical health doesnt have to suffer as much as my mental health.

Good luck out there. I'll bookmark your story but I hope things turn up for you in the end"
depression,fear9er,t3_eoactf,1578951519.0,"I feel like I struggle with expressing myself but not in the way that I can't bring myself to speak. Instinctually, I lie or avoid topics without realising, even to the people that I tried to reach out for help. In a way, I can appear honest and open but it's a facade that's hard to overcome"

Seems just like a misunderstanding and lack of the gf knowing how op was like with friends.. 

It is kinda dissapointing that people immediately demonized the girl's reaction. We don't know her side of the story.. since it could be true that it's not normalized where op or his gf are from. 

I'm always happy seeing people be affectionate. I wish I could be affectionate to my friends as well, but it's not normalized in my culture (regardless of gender). everyone has different boundaries too and I wouldn't wanna push the ideas of platonic affection to people who aren't ready. Maybe she can open up to understand this better? 

Personally, from a relationship standpoint, I think lip pecks are fine but done excessively (too long or serious lmao) would be crossing my boundaries. Discussing where the line is drawn for both op and his gf would be best for everyone."
