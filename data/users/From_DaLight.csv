offmychest,fewii4p,t3_eqs9t9,1579411223.0,Sorry to hear this. Have you guys talked about it any further than the fight?

AskReddit,feuhr3m,t1_feugmn7,1579386627.0,"Can understand that frustration if someone isn't letting you speak or finish your sentence. At the time it must have been infuriating but perhaps as time has moved on it's bothered you less and less? 

Did you ever bring it to this person's attention? Or did you find a way to deal with it yourself?"
AskReddit,feugw6x,t1_feufrl3,1579386463.0,Did you want to elaborate or just keep it at that? Curious to know what was it and how did you get through the wall
AskReddit,fekypg0,t1_fejl0t0,1579210363.0,Very weird :/

AskReddit,fehmlo3,t1_fegqjcu,1579119607.0,How did you even survive with a broken arm for 2 weeks?! Was there anything else super challenging to do during those 2 weeks?
AskReddit,fehliw8,t3_ep7ap4,1579118982.0,"Met Orlando Bloom. He was very orange and signed my book but wouldn't say my name or interact with me beyond signing my book. At the time we weren't allowed to ask about Miranda Kerr or the fight he had with Justin Bieber

Overall, 1/10 fan experience. He was not pleasent 

PS: this was at Supanova Australia few years back"
AskReddit,fdsqwti,t3_ems7v9,1578706784.0,"When people are consistently late to anything and everything. I'd love to shake these people and tell them what they are doing is really disrespectful and very frustrating. 

Alright, I get it. Sometimes shit happens and your late. That's alright, let the person know. But if it's EVERY SINGLE GOD DAMN TIME  there is something wrong with your priorities"
venting,fdq268r,t3_emm3ho,1578651185.0,"So, what's your favourite TV show atm?"
AskReddit,fdoi6x5,t1_fdoa1pr,1578605649.0,"Yeah same here. He just became way too mainstream. I loved that he would give attention to indie games, found a lot of interesting games through that but as he got more popular everything he did started to suck ;/"
AskReddit,fdohr41,t1_fdniui4,1578605394.0,"I was waiting for someone to mention this guy. Used to watch him heaps back in the day but found the quality in his videos had dropped in terms of content and being funny. Probably good he called it quits because it was obvious we had moved on. I like that he tried to keep it going with someone else but it's just not the same unfortunately

Not really a fan of what he does now, don't find it funny at all but perhaps others love it"

confessions,fc47t78,t1_fc46p9v,1577408945.0,"I won't deny that shame has often been mixed with sex for me, didn't realise it came through my dream (pun unintended). I had some fun with a few guys before my current boyfriend but it never escalated to sex. I wanted to keep that with someone special

Perhaps a counselor isn't a bad idea

Thank you"
confessions,fc461fw,t1_fc440m0,1577407573.0,"Thanks for the reassurance! It comforts me to know I guess this is more common than I thought and is normal. I believe it is healthy to be honest with yourself hence why I don't deny I find others attractive but would never act on it.  

Yeah, you're right. I do have a good sexual relationship with my partner. We're both pretty happy and can have a discussion if we aren't.

Thank you!"
