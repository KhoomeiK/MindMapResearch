BravoRealHousewives,ffdk0mn,t1_ffda8tr,1579822510.0,Video leaked of Brandi doing a bad asian accent and squinty eyes...I can’t remember what she actually said though.
BravoRealHousewives,ff897ij,t1_ff4u9zd,1579669710.0,"On the aftershow on youtube, Tanner and Ashton ""explain"" what happened from their point of view - apparently Rhylee didn't wait long enough for them to react before she got upset. Tanner said he had to chew his food first before he could respond to her, as if any decent human being can't just scoot over while still chewing."

houseplants,ff2d3mq,t1_ff2cs8d,1579501306.0,It's obviously 100% satire/shitpost and gave me a good laugh
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fekj4rw,t1_fejyhig,1579201125.0,It’s funny because Kail says “you clowns go together” and the girl says “I don’t want him” - so they’re making fools of themselves over a guy neither even want? Basically they’re both trying to sound tough and unbothered when they’re both so obviously bothered.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fejyd75,t1_fejy596,1579188651.0,"Kail is telling a girl to stop texting Chris, the girl then tells Kail she will fight her, and also says she doesn’t want Chris. And they both call each other ‘bitch’ approximately 300 times."
MakeupAddictionCanada,fecq0la,t1_feb0vj2,1578980458.0,Same. I've stopped taking samples (from anywhere) unless I'm 100% sure I can use it. Having a stash of samples just gives me anxiety.
AnimalCrossingNewLeaf,fe0j7fh,t3_encibq,1578814237.0,Aw man :(
MakeupAddictionCanada,fdtzhd7,t3_en3neq,1578724820.0,Get yourself some goo-gone or make a paste from olive oil + baking soda and scrub off the stickiness
