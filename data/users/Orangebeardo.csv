Everyone needs water, basic food, a roof over their head and access to medicine. These things should all be provided free of charge. Poverty wouldnt be an issue anymore, and working becomes an activity to improve life, not a necessity for living it.

Edit: to the guy with the comment about people not wanting to work if they get free food and houses: 

Of course they will. People don't need money as a motivation for work, if that were true we never would have left the caves 500.000 years ago.

In my view people would vote on the actual policy thats made from day to day.

I hate the idea of a username/password combination. Instead I believe we should all log in with a single (government provided) hash to every service the internet can provide. It would link all your account on any website together. Yes I dislike the idea just as much as you do in the current political climate, however I believe it to be inevitable. We just need to build a government we can trust to provide us with login credentials and not snoop on them for anything but preventing crime or proving one happened.

Well.... ok I wont say they have it *bad*, comparitively, however there is one area in particular where we would probably all benefit from kids having more say: schools. 

Schools are fucking aweful. And I don't mean just the UK, but practically everywhere except for maybe a few modern places that have dropped the old approach. 

Shoving 30 to 50 kids in a classroom, arbitrarily separated by age instead of ability, and expecting them all to learn at the same pace is one of the longest running idiotic things ive ever seen. We've known for decades that this doesn't work well and that there are better methods out there.

A country stands or falls with its schools. A country is run by people, people run on ""software"", and that software is molded by our schools. The quality of a countries schools directly influences policy and the country some 20 to 30 years later, when those kids grow up. I directly attribute the current global political crisis to the failure of policy makers to make schools ~~better~~ adequate in the past."
LeopardsAteMyFace,fen4uue,t1_femove3,1579277007.0,"Hmm interesting. 

We vote at one specific moment, and then everythings stays the same for 4 years.

Perhaps we should do ""continuous"" voting instead. A person would be able to change their vote at any point in time, and when enough people do, the appropriate changes in office should be made, either once a day or once a week. 

It would solve a ton of problems with democracy (but also obviously introduce some mostly logistical problems, which I think are solvable). Campaigning wouldnt really be a thing anymore. Instead what starts to matter is policy.

Ill stop here, i could probably write a book on the issue here about the pros and cons, but i dont want to bombard you with a wall of text.

Thoughts?

P.s. to finish what i started: this would also result in the votes of dead people being removed."
