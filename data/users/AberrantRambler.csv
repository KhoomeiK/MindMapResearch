Don’t change how the gun feels around the trigger and where you hold it. Change how it feels at the far ends - particularly the butt of the gun is what caught my eye in the video. It’s moving too quickly based on slight movements for something as heavy as a gun.  if you take a pencil you can wiggle it back and forth in your hand and the end moves very quickly - do it with a gold rod witht he same dimensions and you wont be able to change the intertia of the end so quickly."
ender3,ff66b9w,t1_ff61jp4,1579620175.0,"That looks a lot like you're over extruding.  It lays down the layer one direction and then the opposite for the next layer.  If there were any spots where too much material came out it'd create slight areas where it's raised and then the next layer going over it is creating the raised surface.  It's possible your first layer is fine as laid down, but the nozzle is accumulating the extra material and then dropping it at inconvenient times on top.

Have you tried lowering the flow rate in your slicer to like 95% and seeing if it still happens?

Edit: It could also be a combination as well, you're over extruding but the nozzle is too close for the first layer (masking the over extrusion for that layer)"
