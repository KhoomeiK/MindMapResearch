IllegalLifeProTips,ffewirr,t1_ffehpzg,1579868440.0,Ooo snap! Can u share some examples? Revenge is so delicious!
AskVet,ffcnjxz,t1_ffc62rp,1579803246.0,Interesting. Ok could be neurological then. Bring him to the clinic for an evaluation and possibly testing to make sure it’s not a symptom of something more serious.
AmItheAsshole,ffcltx9,t3_essrci,1579802194.0,r/weddingshaming is leaking hard. You’re definitely an ass for this. Plz grow your self esteem! You actually sound jealous and insecure. If this is your day then why would someone else’s (natural) hair ruin it? You got a lot of nerve and entitlement. May god have mercy on your future spouse.
AskVet,ffc5scr,t3_esu79s,1579792190.0, Is he neutered?
askwomenadvice,ffbwoqh,t3_esrnrq,1579785238.0,"Ha! Are u married to my husband? Could they be twins separated from birth? The resemblance is uncanny. 

Mine does the same. Any issue I want to calmly discuss, he begins to raise his voice and yell, get defensive and play victim. It annoys the shit out of me! If I try shushing his volume or ask him to keep it down (we have kids) he will fly off the handle accuse me of interrupting him and not listening. like he will rant on and on about that instead of just lowering his voice and continuing the conversation. Like I am trying to hear him out but I just don’t want to listen to him yelling and I certainly don’t want our kids listening to their father screaming and swearing at me because it’s toxic and I don’t want to alarm them or be questioned by them. 

Annnnd just like u, If I have an issue, suddenly he has to bring his problems w me up. Why wait until my grievances to bring up yours if not to deflect? It’s not like I’m unreasonable to talk to (I also do relationship happiness check ins) it’s ridiculous to me that we cannot have a conversation without him screaming and yelling. I’ve brought his behaviour up many a times even when we’re not fighting in the hopes we can learn to communicate better. It is always met with turning things on me or him playing victim. I literally cannot with this man!"

TwoXChromosomes,fem2hs3,t1_fem0i23,1579237594.0,Yess I agree and I think if ur in a position of power where ur job depends on public trust the penalties should be double.
TwoXChromosomes,fem26r4,t1_felw6ms,1579237318.0,Absolutely! Thatâ€™s a great point! Talking about it really helps victims shed the shame attached to sexual assault.

Instagramreality,fdgpgu8,t1_fdg28nv,1578404841.0,"Why do u ppl do this? U bring up interesting points that spark conversation, ppl get invested and ask questions to further the conversation and broaden their understanding then u dismiss them to google? I think either youâ€™re talking out your ass or u donâ€™t have the conversational skills to explain."
Astronomy,fddfbyy,t1_fckp9p0,1578309712.0,"I guess something simple that they can interact with and tells them different facts about whatever planet or space thing theyâ€™re seeing perhaps even allow them to build their own universe so to speak. It would be cool to see the different phases of the moon, stars or the sun, even to see the Big Bang theory in live motion! My son is 7 and he loves space and the planets it would be so cool if there was some kinda program/app to better explain things especially if itâ€™s visually interactive I think heâ€™d love it!"

AmItheAsshole,fcr41aq,t1_fcq5ylg,1577896462.0,"Exactly. While op maybe attention starved and desperate for online validation, her actions donâ€™t make her a bad parent. In fact Iâ€™m willing to bet most parents did similar! The kid is young and doesnâ€™t need to be up at midnight. Ppl who are calling her a shit mom clearly have no kids."
AmItheAsshole,fcr3lpj,t3_eiep0m,1577896292.0,"Why is this even a post? U knew when u said u wanted to go get shit faced ppl would be pissed. Clearly ur kid is at an age where she donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s going on so who cares?  Ur kid went to bed not knowing Wdf is going on so why is this a post. You sound like a great mother btw. 

Side rant: can we stop posting attention starved validation posts? Like stop posting obvious shit where clearly youâ€™re the ahole! Save this sub for actual worthwhile debates."
