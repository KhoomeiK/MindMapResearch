college,ff6uxv6,t1_ff6ukry,1579635406.0,"Oh and also, you can choose to take a ""leave of absence"" on your school's official website where you register which is basically like taking a semester off for whatever reason. My school allows me to use up to 4 semesters, doesn't have to be all at once, and i keep my spot in the school without having to reapply. Only downside is loan repayments have to start after 6 months cuz I'm using up the grace period. You could use that time to work a music job like be an intern somewhere and see if you actually like working in the field. Might be too late to do this leave of absence now since school already started but you could do it in the future if you're still not decided."
college,ff6ukry,t3_eryvyv,1579635188.0,"Music ed major here (studying voice). I went through something similar. Went through a period of not liking what I'm doing and being bored outright of everything. This actually can happen to adults who've been working in the music field all their life and eventually grow tired of it and need something else to do. Maybe you're in a bad spot right now personally and it's affecting your work. Alot of my friends started out with music ed then switched to music performance. For me, I just took one semester to take all gen ed courses and one music course (lessons) to figure things out and try new things and see if I either hated music now or hated the environment I was in. 

When I came back the next semester, I decided ehh fuck it I'll continue with music. I just needed a long hiatus from it and also I was surrounded by annoying people in certain music classes, and certain professors that needed to retire that were still teaching made classes boring. I don't have that same flame like when I was a freshman and wanted to do really good in my studies, but I still enjoy what I'm doing overall. It's just stressful and hard work wise because sitting in the practice room for hours and working on atonal theory and the crazy units and multiple ensembles involved can wear a person down mentally and emotionally.

I'm actually writing an article on college musician health and maintenance from an interview I had with a music teacher and asked her these sorts of questions like do people get tired of it even when they're years into their teaching and yes they do, I have a couple stories of what happened with that and what to do when you're faced with a period of uncertainty. If you want to read that article, just dm me, I'm almost done.

Maybe take gen ed courses if you haven't already enrolled in all your classes. If it's before the add/drop deadline, consider dropping ensemble courses or whatever course you can afford to take at a later time while you figure out if you still want to do music. And the answer will come gradually. Just try new things like going to a local high school band concert or orchestra concert and see if you like the environment or ask the practicum professors if you can observe a local middle school or high school music classroom to see if you like that environment. Because going to school for anything, be it nursing or art or law, the learning and hard work takes the fun out of it. Cuz you're forced to do everything and experiment with things you won't even need (like atonal music theory, no highschool would ever learn that shit). It's a long process and hope you find solace in whatever else you choose."
college,ff6t18a,t3_erz3rg,1579634283.0,"Try getting some documentation from a counselor on campus or a therapist if you have one or go to the student disability center to get accomodations. They can write letters saying ""Person X may have attendance issues due to his disability so please consider flexible attendance"". Once you have a letter from a therapist or disability office, save it or scan it so you can show it to all future professors in case this comes up again. Just say ""Hi I've been having a hard time coming to class, here's some documentation that shows why."" and they'll take it alot more seriously. Usually most TAs and professors will you take you seriously even without the documentation and take your word for it, but it's nice to have those official papers in case your mental health gets really bad to a point that you have to drop a class and need documentation for official purposes like with the registrar.

All in all, be honest and tell them you're struggling  because once they know, they can expect it in the future. Take it from someone who missed weeks and weeks of classes due to depression."

college,feg129x,t3_eolyw6,1579072382.0,"You can try a medical withdrawal, if it's related to depression and it most likely is if you don't already know about it. Honestly just withdraw because you're not in a healthy place of mind and won't do any better if you try pushing through. You need a break and time to sort things out and see a counselor and a therapist. I don't mind staying in college more than 4 years. Had to drop several classes and do a withdrawal myself. It's worth taking care of your health."

college,feg0l5z,t3_eoqqn6,1579071830.0,"There might be important information you would miss that the professor tells only in class. Also unless you're super self determined and have good discipline (unlike me I'm not disciplined much), think about how much effort it would take to learn things on your own instead of going to class. It's up to you but if you can manage it, I'd say it's worth saving yourself the hassle. Also if something bad ever comes up, like you do bad in the class and you need help from the professor, she's more likely to help you if they recognize your face and see that you've been going to class regularly imo."
college,feg0dj4,t3_eosk6j,1579071591.0,"You can try seeing your assistant dean (person who specializes in student affairs) and ask for help and they can give you options. Sounds like you need a medical withdrawal which is basically dropping all the courses in the middle of the semester and not having them listed as incompletes so that way you can just do those classes again later with an entirely new fresh start. Might make you stay in college a little longer than 4 years but your health is worth it. If you keep going at this rate, your grades could do really bad and it might be too late to do anything about it unless you do an sap appeal or something or retroactive withdrawal. Dealing with that shit, emotionally and physically, is alot of stress for anyone to take. You have valid excuses, your grandma passed away and you have health problems right now. If dropping an entire semester seems too much, try talking to the assistant dean or a counselor and they can help you sort things out."

depression,fecv84n,t3_eofo27,1578985949.0,"I threw a large party at my house right before Christmas time. About 45 of my friends came, mostly college friends and some old highschool friends I really cared about and heck even my ex gf that I recently got on good terms with again. I was feeling very suicidal and depressed for several months til I started trying to be more extroverted to turn my life around. Around October an idea popped in my head ""Hm since I don't get invited to alot of parties, maybe i should throw my very own first party."" I'm a musician (pianist) and hired my guitarist and drummer friend to play 2 hours worth of live Christmas music with me for my guests and spent about $200 on food and abput $300 on sheet music. Then I had a toast at the end serving everyone apple cider and had a speech telling everyone that I've been severely depressed for years but have been trying really hard to turn life around for myself and that I'm thankful for each and everyone of them for making my Christmas this year. I felt amazing for the first time in a long time and was showered with cheers and toasts. I know I spent like $500 all of which was financial aid from college but it was well worth it. Dm if you wanna see pics and vids of that."
Advice,fecn36s,t3_eoeujk,1578978033.0,It's common that people who need disability get rejected by the govt. It's how the govt weeds out people who don't really need the aid. What you're supposed to do is apply multiple times until they accept you. Cuz fuck he is for sure disabled. Keep applying several more times as long as it takes. I learned this from my case manager who works with the clinic I get therapy from. I was also told this by my dad's insurance agent because they were helping my dad get disability. He got rejected several times til they finally accepted him.
Advice,fecmki8,t3_eofglx,1578977640.0,"It took my over 9 months to get over my depression from my 2nd ex girlfriend breaking up with me. I thought about her constantly every day, and it was torture. Eventually I found someone else to have a crush on that distracted me from my hurt feelings til they went away. Everyone heals differently. Everyone takes a different amount of time to get better and move on. It could still be a few more months for you. So it's okay to feel sad and hurt because it's normal. When i was left out of friend groups because of certain people hating me, I was the one that lead hang outs now and so my friends would come to me and the ones that didn't like me weren't there cuz they didn't want to see me."
Advice,feclqc5,t3_eoelz7,1578977027.0,"Your sister did something brave to tell you that and it also shows that she trusts you. Most people never tell anyone else and keep it a secret. Try following up with her every once in a while like once every couple of weeks gently ask ""how's your therapy going?"". Do some research on it as much as you can like on reddit or google. There's usually some mental disturbance that accompanies EDs such as negative body image. Maybe recommend some mental health instagram pages to follow that will remind her regularly to take care of herself. Be supportive as you can and never show any signs of anger or being upset as that can scare her."

college,fe6t7pw,t3_enx47v,1578904311.0,"Went through almost the exact same situation. I'm debating taking a semester off too rn. I had a professor who was eager to help let me drop his class because i was failing and he understood my struggles because he once took medications for his asthma that resulted in giving him diabetes. He's alot slower and more tired these days and very old and his very messy office is a clear indication of his depression like mine. He sympathized with me and told me that ""If your health is not good, you won't be able to do anything. You might as well stay in bed all day.""

Maybe talk to a therapist or counselor on campus if you don't already have one. There's also assistant deans of every major or every 'school' of study whose primary purpose is student affairs which is basically helping students get what they need and also should be kind affectionate people to talk to and can help give you perspective on what it's like.

Take it from me who thought I was gonna graduate in 4 years and was devastated that I had to drop out an entire semester in the middle of Fall. Only to realize most of the music majors I work with also stay there 5-6 years before they graduate. I first developed major depression/ptsd/Pyschosis in 2017 and it's 2020 and I still haven't figured things out because I keep failing classes or not passing because I'm still very depressed, haven't found the right antidepressants with my doctors. 

Take a semester off, enjoy the feeling of being able to do nothing for a couple weeks and be carefree and stressfree because that's what we all need sometimes especially if we're clinically depressed. Maybe find a job to work in the meantime to make some extra cash, and maybe travel somewhere nice either disneyland or in another state and try to experience happiness for a little bit.

Or if you continue school, take the bare minimum 12 units or 11 units or whatever the minimum is to be considered full time for getting maximum financial aid, or if you can afford it, go part time with school. Having less things to stress about will help the quality of the work you do. 

Also try seeing if there's a disability accomodation center on campus. You'd need some documentation from a doctor and therapist but they primarily help people like you who struggle to function with daily tasks so don't feel ashamed to ask for help. It's their job to help you. They can give you extra time for exams, permission to use listening devices to record lectures if it's hard to concentrate and you can just listen to them later like in a library where you can focus. And they can give you priority registration which is being able to register for classes you want earlier than everyone else which comes in REALLY handy if there are certain professors you want whose classes fill up fast."

Pepper gel is also more effective and shoots further and doesn't fly back into your face around windy nights. Also you can try taking a self defense class. The exercise would be nice and would also be a good outlet."
college,fe6sh67,t3_enygay,1578903280.0,"I hate the saying that people tell me which is ""go find some groups or clubs"" because I'm a very busy person and have no time for frats or gaming clubs but for others it can work. I'm asian and there are a handful of different asian groups on my campus like korean groups or samahan(filipino) groups and people are placed in respective ""families"" and hang out with each other alot. It's also nice to hang out with alot of people your same ethnicity because they probably deal with the same cultural norms from families or go through same issues and interests.

If not then maybe interesting clubs like videogaming clubs, a damn music club like mariachi or join the campus choir. How about a fun elective like bowling? I took a bowling class and made a few good friends.

I felt really lonely for the longest time like 3 years and it wasn't until I became the extroverted one to ask people to hang out or get to know them better and initiate all the contact that I finally had larger circles of friends and heck started getting invited to actual college parties. I don't drink but it was nice to hang around people, all of which I knew and for those I didn't know, I introduced myself and then added them on social media. Eventually I got tired of partying and what I liked more was hanging out with people on individual basis and having their single undivided attention."
college,fe6s4uh,t3_enyhjr,1578902820.0,"You have pretty good chances at getting your appeal accepted. Just be honest and explain how homelessness made it hard to attend classes and do well. Like jesus christ you were more focused on trying to stay alive. Try to see a counselor at the school for help and see if there are resources on campus for students in economic emergencies like yours. Even if you're not entirely broke rn, there should be programs that give food or food cards to students that need it. Also some temporary housing. Any little bit will help."

confession,f400n5u,t3_di8v0y,1571281513.0,"There are resources and people on campuses whose job is to help students that are going through issues that affect their schooling. Usually colleges have assistant deans that assist with student affairs. Like you can email them and ask for advice and talk to them in person about what's going on and they can even help you late drop the course from the registrar and it'll show up as a ""withdrawn"" on your grades instead of an ""F"". They can get you letters of support for this or see counselors to get support letters too basically saying you have mental health issues that are making you struggle in classes and possibly get accommodations for future classes. That way, you can stop worrying about that course instead of stressing out trying to salvage your grade until the end of the semester and have extra time to focus on your health and you can retake it again down the line when you're feeling better. No one cares if you have to retake a course a year later or stay in college an extra year. Focus on your health, you can't learn anything if you're not in the right place of mind."
