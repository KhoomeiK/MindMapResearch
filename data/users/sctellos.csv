cars,fcy1mxv,t3_eivvop,1578073479.0,"The Story of California State Route 12.

For a time, a stretch of SR 12 in CA between Solano and Sacramento county experienced an inordinate amount of traffic fatalities compared to other highways in the state. Due to this the state established the stretch as a 'safety corridor.' Among factors like increased highway patrol presence, and other considerations, a double-fine was placed on moving violations that occur within the stretch. The fine was to act as a deterrent, however something needed to be done about the inherent dangers of that particular stretch that exacerbated the amount of accidents, thus construction began to augment the highway to be safer. I moved from the area around a decade ago when construction began and as of recent visits this construction in it's entirety is still incomplete. Which brings the other slice of bread in this shit sandwich- work zones.

In CA (and many other states) if you commit a moving violation in a work zone, fines are doubled- however there are stipulations on how this is works- for instances workers or equipment must be present. Well anyone trifling along 12 will notice often the tar tractors and steam rollers, trucks, cranes, and other equipment are left along the road- perhaps for efficiency's sake, or judging on the pace of the project, perhaps more nefarious purposes.

The sludgy, very Californian shit of this shit sandwich is the resultant quadruple fine you could face for committing a moving violation on this stretch of freeway designed, engineered, and maintained by inept thugs. Effectively, during the greatest economic recession many of us will ever see in our lifetimes, I had personally seen this highway destroy  the lives of people... for speeding."
