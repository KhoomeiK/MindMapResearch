leagueoflegends,fgu6sj6,t1_fgsorm7,1581114223.0,"Aphelios is probably easier to be average with, playing him at his best is extremely hard though. I never played with either but I'd feel more secure playing Aphelios than ASol honestly."

leagueoflegends,fgu5o4v,t1_fgszogt,1581113763.0,Then what exactly are you judging them for? For not giving a game this high of a priority?
worldnews,fgqx2dt,t1_fgqwbc9,1581033300.0,They're pretty much trained to see people as enemies. Unless they're white that is.

soccer,fgqgx15,t1_fgpx6xp,1581023963.0,"I don't blame him there, it was a strong shot."
ContagiousLaughter,fgpv3pp,t1_fgptkue,1581012587.0,"No need to reinforce your factually wrong point. No one said about how ""likely"" it is for a cat to get traumatized after an assault, but it is very within the realm of possibility and, as OP said, it's just giving it proper treatment. Pets can get trauma and I don't know why this has anything to do with moralism. It's just... knowledge.

And we also don't know how it happened. If the cat jumped into their neighbors' backyard then it's stupid to blame the dog or the owner I agree, but if the cat was in its own house and the neighbors' dog escaped and assaulted him then it's 100% on the owners for not controling their dog. It's fair to give the benefit of doubt here. It's never the dogs' fault though."
ContagiousLaughter,fgpscgg,t1_fgprjl9,1581011055.0,"That's cat on cat. Have you seen a cat after being attacked by a dog? Do you also believe that all cats react the same for everything? Have you never seen rescued animals that needed medication to recover from trauma?

How is the entire concept of an animal having a traumatic event give it lasting effects so weird to you? Specially now that you seem to own one."
ContagiousLaughter,fgpr2lu,t1_fgpi56o,1581010349.0,"It's honestly shocking that this comment gets upvoted, I guess this thread is attracting people that don't own/care about pets.

If fireworks can cause anxiety and other health problems on pets, you can bet your ass a physical assault would. This shouldn't have to be said."
Kaguya_sama,fgph4zn,t1_fgor2wr,1581004694.0,"Less that she should. She seems to forget how important Chika was to her too much, and Kaguya remembering that is probably getting its own arc eventually."
Kaguya_sama,fgpgvm6,t1_fgoq9dm,1581004548.0,"I'm not sure, this seems to be setting up a later event. Ishigami's date is much more immediate and was also set up this chapter, it's probably going to be 180."
ContagiousLaughter,fgpg9t3,t1_fgpdtvz,1581004210.0,"How the fuck is that anthropomorphizing the cat? He got hurt and had a traumatic experience, not unlike animals victim of abuse. As OP said, that's just giving the cat proper treatment. Trauma and anxiety is not a human exclusive thing lmao."

leagueoflegends,fgkcid1,t1_fgjqn14,1580862378.0,I think it would be too similar to his Nightbringer skin.
leagueoflegends,fgkcaiq,t1_fgje85x,1580862236.0,Read his comment again. He literally said that Yi's last skin was after Ornn.
leagueoflegends,fgjy7rm,t1_fgjfraa,1580853721.0,"It's in a 2020 skins preview video in League's main Youtube channel. They announced skins for a lot of Champions that haven't been getting skins for a while, including Kindred, Rek'Sai, Xerath, Taliyah, Ornn etc.

The sad ones are the ones who didn't get mentioned, like Quinn (the only one I know was missing)."

hearthstone,fgjtqb3,t3_eytv2y,1580851217.0,"I realised this with Riot's new card game. I've been playing HS since GvG, and I thought I was getting tired of it and decided I would finally put it aside and move on to Legends of Runeterra.

...And then I realised I just enjoy playing Hearthstone so much more than that, or any other, card game. I might take a break from card games in general, but Hearthstone will still be the one I'll come back to."
Kaguya_sama,fgjkjxw,t3_eyhmjf,1580845948.0,"The manga is as amazing as the anime, there's not a SINGLE bad chapter.

That said, the second season is so close that you just might want to wait a bit to watch it first considering how good the adaptation and the VAs were. After S2 you should read the manga from the beginning, because there are great chapters that didn't get adapted (which will surely happen for S2 as well).

And yes, a lot of things happen. Including a new Council member and more drama. First season ended at chapter 45 iirc and we're currently at chapter 177."

Kaguya_sama,fght8zp,t1_fgfspe2,1580793204.0,180 might be Ishigami's date. The last two chapters are setting it up.
Kaguya_sama,fght5yq,t1_fggkj5x,1580793134.0,Imagine Hayasaka becoming a full on council member. They still have some roles left.

aww,fgggawr,t1_fgfyisz,1580761267.0,I've heard of a Brazilian that was abroad (USA iirc) and a Russian suddenly excitedly started speaking to him in Russian. They had heard his accent and thought he was Russian as well.

soccer,fgfjw6r,t1_fgf87db,1580740742.0,"My point is that he was the actual most mentally fragile player throughout the tournament. He wouldn't have been much of a help, he would be the first to break. Maybe Neymar would make them have a proper reaction, but I also don't believe that. They were all (but Neymar) visibly feeling extremely pressured from the pre-WC friendlies until they finally broken in the semi."

anime,ffrn7pt,t1_ffqq7ld,1580161540.0,"Animation is very very mediocre, but honestly that's one of the ""better"" things about the adaptation. Sound directing is straight up horrible, pacing is weird, some jokes have bad timing, voice acting was off, etc.

While it's pretty clear he understands and respects Iino really well, even when other characters bash her for they see in her surface. And now we know they have shared nerdy interests.

I think we'll get to a point where Tsubame accepts to give the relationship a try, but by that time Ishigami will have matured up and will realise his true feelings. Or maybe they DO date for a bit, but that won't last long. 

Tsubame will move on with a lesson learned as well either way."
