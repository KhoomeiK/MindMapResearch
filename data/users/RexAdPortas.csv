SelfAwarewolves,ff901zo,t1_ff8zgwq,1579701370.0,I'm not asking for more. I'm saying making every job 50/50 is completely ridiculous and pointless. Men and women's reproductive organs generate hormones which drastically change behaviour during their whole life and their genitalia prescribe different priorities. We are very much equals but trying to peg every job as 50/50 is pointless. Should we have 50/50 surrogate mothers and 50/50 male prostitutes?

SelfAwarewolves,ff8n6z1,t3_es7055,1579686958.0,"It depends on the field but 50/50 is often not most qualified. Teachers, please more women, military, please more men. We are equal but we are not the same and that should be lauded and not forced out of us.

Nothing I'm about to say is an absolute because there are outliers in every group but women in general are more empathic, men in general are physically stronger.

It would make schools less focused on nurturing students if it were equal parts men and women in leadership roles and it would make a military less effective. Yes there are millions of very empathic and caring men who are amazing teachers but assuming everything would benefit from a 50/59 split is downright negligent. Women too can be as strong and combat effective as men but to reach the same level of physical fitness(literally muscle mass) where 50% of women are as strong as 50% of men in the army is impossible because of how hormones influence muscle growth on the human body.

Any all encompassing statement ignores the reality of day to day people who see how the fields actually work and what are the requirements of each."

Have some self respect and ghost her for disrespecting you like that. She wants best of both worlds and she doesn't deserve it. You have every right to deny her for denying you the relationship you want.

This is treading thin ground but I'd argue to say that if she feels she can have you with no resistance whatsoever that's part of why she lost attraction to begin with.

You became too easy going and you got too comfortable with the relationship. Like if at the first moment you saw her you would have been like. Oh my god I love you so much please let me have sex with you, you would get so totally rejected. When a relationship slides into that later on its still as bad but instead of a 'Fuck no creep' you get a 'I want to see other guys but I want to know you'll still do what I say'

She doesn't deserve your dick if she's leaving it for another. Be glad this is over and work on yourself till you meet someone who'll not treat you like a vibrator. Be sure to stay the same man you went into the relationship as until you die or attraction will drain."

You're basically going to want to meet some people to hang out with though, try looking on Fb for language exchanges or anything really. You might be interested in Loki Bar and Hostel. It's usually full of tourists that meet up at the bar on the first floor of the hostel. It's not too nice but you can get to know people to hang out with. A bar called Lúpulo near Kennedy Park has language exchange days like some other places.

I'd suggest hanging out in el Malecón (boardwalk) in Miraflores as a base and go other places with people you meet around there.

Uber is definitely the way to go for transport just to be sure you're not getting over charged and that you'll be way safer.

Advice,fczdhig,t1_fczbv9y,1578098749.0,"No closeted gay people are a myth, like ghosts and santa Claus. I know they exist, I'm saying there are plenty of other things it could be,i think assuming it's that isn't helpful. It's definitely less likely now that ever for him to be a closeted gay person in a long term relationship but they were fine for years before this according to the post so it's even less likely. I feel its unessary and its disproportionately mentioned in the comments.

Maybe he is just super mean and wanted to troll, maybe not.
It's definitely extreme compared to the very common and very real 100 other things it could be. I'm not belittling the struggle of closeted gay people who don't feel comfortable getting out of the closet in the most Liberal time in human history. I'm just seeing disproportionate approval of this being the reason over the more probable things like a psychological issue/hang up with a guy and his gf. Having personally experienced it and gotten over it I would hate people advising my gf I'm gay because I had a bad day at work or fought with my parents and wasn't in the mood and couldn't get it up. It might make her doubt in him more pushing him farther from her."

Advice,fcyz3p8,t3_ejgzas,1578090279.0,"Has he had sex with you? Being bad in bed is different from not getting it up. I've had trouble getting it up and it was mostly some variation of self confidence and emotional connection. Please consider he could be very self conscious about it even if he doesn't seem to be and trying to get you to look sexier could be him trying to fix the problem in his head with changing how you look. The best sex I've ever had where we both came was when I was entirely focused on pleasuring myself and that's not to say I don't go down on my girl and treat her right but if he's thinking about you and how he should please you it's a lot harder for him to get his stuff to work. You can blow him from soft to hard, he doesn't need to be hard to start. You can also make sure you tell him you don't care and you want him to be with you. For me, and this might be super subjective I'm best in bed when I can feel super dominant and my girl loves when I'm rough with her too some moments. Tell him to fuck you whenever he feel like it like a awesome surprise. It might be hard to talk about but that's a big part of the problem. You might feel secure with him but he doesn't feel the same with you and its different for men and women to feel secure in straight relationship(or any relationship) because there's still masculine femenine dynamics and each side gets security from different things. Men(or more masculine people) from being dominant and women(or femenine people) from feeling safe."

The would send all their planes to a single airfield where they outnumbered the defending planes even if they were outnumbered 3 to 1 in air power overall. They would have the number adv against single airfields. This is very similar to Nazi Luffwafel techie of maximising a smaller airforce.
