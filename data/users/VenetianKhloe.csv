bipolar,fdo7xqz,t1_fdmrwek,1578600448.0,"I donâ€™t have insurance and pretty poor at the moment ): how do you know if you need to be hospitalized? 
One of my worst symptoms is doubting every single feeling I have so I always feel like im just a hypochondriac until i look back on it later on when the episode has passed."

nonononoyes,fcw9gfq,t1_fcvh5b0,1578020208.0,Pretty sure itâ€™s to land on if he falls/when he climbs back down. If he didnt have it in the video he probably would have fallen on the ground instead of landing it with the wheelchair.
bipolar,fcw7vo8,t1_fcw19gc,1578019165.0,"I feel this so much. Especially about other people expecting you to get better. If iâ€™m not doing well I just feel like a failure and donâ€™t want them to worry about me. Even though I know rationally thatâ€™s not true.

In a weird way it also prevents me from a lot of self harm/destructive behaviors because iâ€™m so afraid of worrying someone, or scaring them, or them being mad at me for hurting myself (past trauma). 

Itâ€™s just annoying honestly lol"

bipolar,fcuhf7g,t1_fcthuan,1577981027.0,"Thank you for letting me know, I honestly didnâ€™t realize it until you said that.

I recently got diagnosed a few months ago, am I supposed to talk to my psych every time i have a depressive episode/manic episode? I just kind of assumed it was something that would always happen. If I spiral into blackness am I supposed to go to the hospital or just talk to my psych about meds?"

bipolar,fcbp4jt,t3_egi3b5,1577589415.0,Lol at being too poor to ever take a break. My only hope at a break or ability to ever be hospitalized if needed relies entirely on striking it rich or someone else with money stepping in to help me. But there is only me.

AskReddit,eyw3hz6,t3_cz2apy,1567519944.0,Was looking at a box cutter knife with the blade out when my mom walked in the room. I quickly shoved it behind my back to hide and stabbed myself on my lower back. Not too bad but bled pretty bad. I hid the pain and the wound and to this day she still has no idea it ever happened lol
