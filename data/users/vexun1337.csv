bipolar,fempwcg,t3_epzxau,1579266093.0,"I was hospitalized when I was 13 for bipolar related issues. If you really have it you need to be on meds. Your dad doesn’t take meds? Does he manage it okay? Maybe it’s not bipolar but extreme anxiety and depression and it’s manageable. If that were the case avoid medication at all cost. I’m 32 and half spent easily 150k on doctor stuff and meds I could have a house paid off.

Stay off meds if there’s any way possible but if you really need them and that’s your doctors opinion then get on them.

More important than meds is counseling. Ask to see a counselor then tell your counselor about the meds and they will try to help by maybe talking to your parents etc. 

Good luck and don’t self harm or abuse drugs it makes it fifty times harder, trust me. I am a shell of a man I have scars all over my body and a constant desire to get high, People talk about how there’s something off with me I know I made my issues worse with bad choices so please be careful."

I think about dying but in a way that it would be a relief and then I remember my wife and family and then know it’s not an option but it always comes back when I struggle. I constantly think about my family members that have fulfilling lives who haven’t spent 100-150k on medical stuff like I have for  bipolar and substance abuse issues. 

I get jealous but never show it, I envy people who have parents they can talk to about their problems, I analyze my childhood and what went wrong, I worry people think I’m stupid or I can’t do my job. 

All of this going on while I appear on the surface very confident and people think I’m very well put together because I look healthy and am a bodybuilder. People ask me for advice or seem to be influenced by me but I can’t even take a piss when I have anxiety because my bladder muscles seize up from nerves"
