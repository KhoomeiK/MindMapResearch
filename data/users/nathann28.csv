literature,fespboh,t3_eqivqe,1579367587.0,"The best thing my teacher told me about analyzing literature is that no opinion is wrong AS LONG AS it is backed up sufficiently in your writing. 
If you think your points are weak, try and back them up and make them stronger by finding how they are significant throughout the book.

From what I remember from reading Frankenstein a while ago was the idea of solitude; both human and monster felt utterly alone in multiple instances, whether it be literal or in their thoughts.

Those are just my thoughts, but good luck!"
