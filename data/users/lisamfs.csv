HomeDecorating,ff5pwps,t1_ff24goo,1579605335.0,"Haha yep! The undertones and lighting make a huge difference! What’s even weirder is that I when take photos of the room, I see the grey walls in photo. But in person, I see blue! My husband corrects me every time “it’s not blue, it’s grey!” I think my eyes just see it differently than his."
HomeDecorating,fesj1gg,t3_eqfmh1,1579365722.0,I have a MCM piece that same shade and we painted the room a graphite color... it’s definitely grey but looks bluish to me at times... anyway it works really well!

beyondthebump,fdexzu3,t1_fdeo06j,1578348989.0,"Is that lotion better than it used to be? Does it ever make you look orange or look bad around your ankles? I remember using it in the early 2000s and loved being tan, but my ankles were atrocious. I’m desperate to be tan again."
