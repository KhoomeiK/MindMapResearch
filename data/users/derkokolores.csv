With the addition of light exercise like walking for an hour a day it becomes more manageable (once the habit is formed). I also wasn’t really assuming it was a woman, but yeah 1000 is tough and probably unsustainable in that case. 

I think 1000 is much more sustainable for larger men and it will get you pretty dang far. 1500 on the other hand? Not so much, even in the short term, which is why I jokingly said to cut water weight for that last 5. 

On that note cutting water weight is dumb unless you are doing weight based sports like wrestling, mma, boxing, body building, etc, and at that point it’s still arguably dumb."
fatlogic,ff5gts5,t1_ff5ggvp,1579592249.0,"Sweat. A lot. High school wrestler me would say go on a run with 2-3 pairs of sweats and a trash bag poncho. Current me wouldn’t recommend. 

Dehydrate. Henry Cavill actually talks about it a couple times when doing press junkets for the Witcher. You can play around with water retention by adjusting your sodium intake along with water consumption. Interesting but also not healthy. 

Also it’s not really “weight”. All that weight comes back as soon as you drink back up. You also see it around the first week of a new diet and/or exercise routine, followed by a short plateau, and then finally real fat/weight loss."
fatlogic,ff52q3i,t3_ern4q3,1579578618.0,"I mean 15 is doable but not necessarily sustainable, especially at higher weights. 10 real pounds is just over 2lbs per week. Then if it’s purely about the number, cut the water weight."

Also because of the General Electric plant, you’ve got large cargo planes like Antinovs occasionally landing to pick up turbines. 

BGR, having having a very large runway and being so eastern, makes it a natural choice for an emergency landing."
AskReddit,fddvuc7,t1_fddnhfi,1578325234.0,"Like a lot of people have said a lot of places in the US are starting to do flex time but they usually have core hours associated so clients/customers/team members know they can get ahold of you. 

Like core hours are 9-3 and you can make up the other 2-3 hours before and/or after I’m whatever way works best for your own life.

LifeProTips,fddhcib,t1_fdcje4g,1578312307.0,Or you know a better one enforce the bag sizes at check in. Half the roller bags I see are massively oversized and need to be muscled in to the bin. Five minutes ago I watched a guy shove his bag that into the bin (clearly tagged for gate check too) and it’s actually causing the bin to deflect... the attendant couldn’t even slide it to the side once it was in.
LifeProTips,fddh4j0,t1_fdcofom,1578312034.0,"The only thing That’s reduces delays for me is to leave on the first flights of the day at either 5 or 6 am. Sucks, but it eliminates the issue of cascading delays caused by planes and crews being stuck somewhere earlier in the day. The odd mechanical issue on YOUR segment and weather are still issues, but less likely."
LifeProTips,fddezs6,t1_fdcvbzy,1578309248.0,"That’s the idea, but no one really checks bag size and they know it will simply be check in for free at the gate if there’s no space or it’s too big. There’s a personal incentive to over pack carry-ons. Who cares if it massively slows down the boarding process? /s"
Maine,fdcxz9j,t3_ekm7b1,1578287637.0,"A lot of people are saying singular food items like lobster, potatoes, blueberries, Moxie, and Allen’s. Those are all solid, but aren’t dishes. 

Lobster Rolls and Bean Supper/Suppah are the classics. Whoopie pies will be found at most potlucks and bake sales as well."

On the contrary, I think most eng students get the idea from faculty and their research that things are ideal and you’re only working with best case scenarios and huge budgets to make the best performing design. In reality the name of the game is to be lowest bidder while still delivering what the client specifies because everyone wants to walk away making profit.

I think it only comes from a couple years of guidance or many harsh QC reviews (hopefully the former) until it clicks."
engineering,fdctvuy,t1_fdcaaps,1578284177.0,"Rather than assume malicious intent, I’ve always assumed the contractor is lowest bidder with a pulse and designed as if they have no capability of independent thought spelling everything out. 

The problem you can run into, especially with  newer engineers, is over specification. Sometimes it can get you in a bind with unforeseen circumstances or just make things more expensive in general. 

You see this with welding symbols all the time. Just because there’s a field to enter a value/symbol/note, doesn’t mean it it needs to be filled. Does your weld really need to be ground flush or can it just be brushed clean? Well that’s going to cost a lot more and that drawing with the symbol in it is a contractual document so tough luck. They’re going to do whatever makes them the most money if allowed. 

Being super specific can go both ways and you have to strike the right balance of specifying exactly what you need so there isn’t any debate and no more."
portlandme,fdcp8cm,t1_fdayc2d,1578280574.0,I only had it once but tacos la poblanita dishes out some pretty big burritos and huge chips/guac portions for not much. Definitely give them a try. Ive always seen them by them around fox/Anderson st.
portlandme,fdcp0oy,t1_fdb4lmh,1578280417.0,"I’ve had a lot of fried chicken in japan and have to say izakaya minato’s is better than most while still staying pretty faithful to the JFC formula. I usually walk out of there spending $100 for two (nearly half that is a big bottle of sake...) but I’ve never felt ripped off. Truly is good food and a rare treat.

I’d argue you could probably get a little more food for your buck at Empire than Izakaya. My bills always end up cheaper there but then again I’m not getting either of their lobster (allergic) dishes nor am I getting full bottles of sake (in that note, get their Dragon’s Milk cocktail, it’s fantastic) . Their beef and broad noodles is a solid deal for a decently sized portion. 

All that said, while both of these places are my favorite restaurants in the city so far, I wouldn’t call either of them frugal by any stretch of the imagination..."
AskEngineers,fcoy2lt,t1_fcowgnr,1577844755.0,"I mean fake confidence until you make it. I’m by no means saying lie about your abilities. There’s just a constant barrage of posts here and on other engineering subs if junior engineers and students feeling inadequate. I think it’s safe to say that we all feel that way for years into our careers, but there’s no reason to vocalize this in interviews as it will do you no good."

AmItheAsshole,fcohw6w,t1_fcniytv,1577832620.0,"If I’ve learned anything from watching way too much livePD it’s that bad people can be very dumb, and in my own experience people will usually tell you their own red flags without realizing they can be red flags (we just choose to ignore them). The whole “mastermind evil person” is pretty rare. That “mastermind” is going to fool all of us. 

In my opinion, there’s no such thing as the “one”  or a “soul mate”, but there are a lot of people that meet all your expectations and make you happy, you just haven’t met them yet. With that and the fact that dating is EASY (this is coming from a not a super good looking dude), why not play it safer? 

If I can eliminate most of the bad women who will lie about their marital status or wait several dates before saying they have kids by doing a quick Facebook check at the expense of a couple good, but “no social media” people, so be it."

Maine,fc0mztb,t1_fbzhwqz,1577294907.0,"I saw it a week ago and agree! Definitely worth the ticket price. If you’re between 18-35, join Rush35 and get tickets for $15 at the door! Kind of mad that I’ve been sleeping in it for so long."
witcher,fbokdo2,t1_fbnl6wa,1577011515.0,I have a flight early this morning and told myself I’d watch the first episode before going to bed. I got through three before I felt like I’d actually sleep through all my alarms and miss my flight.
