This is how I taught my kids to take pills, which is to take a bite of food, chew it up, stick the pill in the mashed up food on your tongue, and swallow it.

Comes with the tubing, dosage cup, mask, etc. The ER doctor at our children's hospital actually recommended buying the cheapest one I could find. You don't need all the bells and whistles. Good luck and I hope your little guy feels better soon. It's so scary when your kids struggle to breathe."

ehlersdanlos,ff4wurq,t3_ern1qu,1579574366.0,"Are you near a good children's hospital? If not, it would probably be worth your while to travel to one. I would definitely want her evaluated by pediatric specialists. Usually at a children's hospital they will take a team approach with a complicated case to get the best diagnosis. They may want her as an inpatient for a few days or want you to stay nearby to complete a full evaluation.

You need a team approach, not piecemeal. I don't know where you live but the top children's hospital in the country include Boston Children's, Texas Children's, CHLA (Los Angeles), Cincinnati Children's, and CHOP (Philadelphia). There are many good hospitals along with these.

 If finances are an issue, I know CHLA treats children on a sliding scale or free of charge, and I would bet many other children's hospital do. Good luck and keep us posted!"

educationalgifs,ff48hdn,t3_erjoxf,1579557834.0,I had a tooth that never grew in. They had to go up and get it just like this video. In my case they opened up the gum and attached a bracket to the tooth. They attached it to the front wire and slowly tightened it until the tooth got pulled down. It was by far the most painful thing that ever happened to my mouth. Took years. But I did end up with beautiful teeth and so did this patient!
RATS,ff4802w,t1_ff44qds,1579557535.0,"Pain control should be a top priority. Just like humans, a rat in pain is miserable, and you can help. If you can get an accurate weight, you can try liquid baby ibuprofen. Dosage based on weight can be found with a Google search."
RATS,ff47s41,t3_erjrd8,1579557398.0,"He does sound sick and also depressed. First I'd get him to a vet as soon as you can. Second, I'd get a new rat or pair of rats, also ASAP. If they're babies you will want to get a pair since another single rat in quarantine will also be lonely. You will want to quarantine the new guys for at least 2 weeks. Ideally you could have them in quarantine while Hamlet heals. You'll have the opportunity to bond with your new guy (s) taking adequate precautions to not spread Hamlet's illness to them. That includes thorough hand washing, changing clothes, maybe even showering between holding them. When Hamlet is completely better (ask the vey about how you will know he's okay) you'll be able to start introductions with your new guys right away instead of making him wait another two weeks to get a friend. I wish you the best of luck. Hamlet sounds like a sweetie and you seem really dedicated to give him a good life."

ehlersdanlos,ff459ik,t3_eriiod,1579555835.0,"I hear you. First off, never apologize for needing an empathetic ear. Your daily life is something that very few people understand but you are still very deserving of support. Isolation like yours it's unbearable for any human. We are simply not meant to live like that. I'm so glad you've got a service pupper, although that of course doesn't replace the kindness of real social interaction. 

I'll admit, I'm a ""fixer"" and sometimes my friends get frustrated with me because they're like ""can you stop solving my problems and just listen?"" So if I'm in that mode, stop reading...

One thing that might really help would be to find a therapist who specializes in chronic illness, disability, and chronic pain. I only learned these people existed until a few years ago when a friend of mine studied it in her at therapy program (which I think is insanely awesome by the way, art therapy with a strong specialization in chronic conditions, but I digress). I know these specialities can be hard to find and few take insurance but many work on a sliding scale and I have heard there are some who do online or phone sessions, so that might be worth a search. One thing that has helped me tremendously has been making social connections in online communities. You may already be doing this! But this can be tricky. I think this particular sub is a really supportive, positive place, but some illness or disability focused groups are positively toxic. Honestly I've met some incredible people online who have turned into amazing irl friends (I live in southern California so there are lots of people around here) but none of them have been from communities based on medical conditions. They've all been through other interests. I met a friend with EDS on a forum for bath products we both like. I'm a professional writer and connected with another EDSer in a writing forum. My daughter was adopted and I have a small group of moms with Disabilities sharing experiencing and emotions surrounding being a mom with chronic pain/fatigue/autoimmune/etc. So whatever you're interested in--gaming? Reading? Ancient Roman history? Parenting/TTC or child-free by choice? Whatever, chances are there's someone in there you can connect with who is empathetic. You could look into some free MOOCS in interesting subjects to keep your brain busy, or start working on an online college degree class by class.

Just really be aware of toxic environment! I can't say that enough. I'm sure you've been around the internet long enough to know that, but any environment that makes you feel worse, makes to want to punch someone, or makes you worry is not worth it.

Anyway, your position truly sucks and I'm sorry. Nobody deserves that. I hope you're about to find more connections and support. Give your doggo a pat for me. DM if you need a sympathetic ear."

That said, Disney Imagineering doesn't make very many of their own animatronics. The company that does is called Garner Holt Productions: http://www.garnerholt.com/. They do the design and nuts and bolts behind most of Disney's audio-animatronics, parades, and a large number of their effects, as well as those for other amusement parks like Knott's Berry Farm and many, many other entertainment venues. I would keep an eye on their careers page: http://www.garnerholt.com/ghp-inc/about-us/careers.aspx Disney relies on a ton of third party vendors for engineering so even if you don't think you'll get a job with Disney, there are many other avenues to pursue."

RATS,fepoq6s,t3_eq7s1n,1579326311.0,"First the best roach bait is hands-down Advion gel. You can get it on Amazon. It's made for professionals and it's a bit that doesn't immediately kill the roach but rather they take it back to the best where it kills a bunch of other little fuckers. Here's a good site on how to use it: https://pestsoff.com/how-to-get-rid-of-cockroaches/advion-gel-bait-review/

It's not rat safe of course, but none of the ""pet-safe"" roach poisons really work. I would keep the rats in their cage full time and put the Advion gel under there. For free roaming transport them to another room like the bathroom. In my experience the Advion only takes a couple of days to work. You could also put the cage in the bathroom or another room until you get the roaches cleared up."

RATS,fendiyb,t1_femu08f,1579282368.0,"It sounds like he might not be the most thorough vet. Is there another within driving distance you can visit? Even if you have to go further? One of my boys had an eye problem and the vet prescribed steroid eye drops that helped tremendously. The liquid antibiotic is probably not a bad idea but a direct eyedrop would be good too. However, unless there's clear signs of worsening, he's probably fine without eye drops. I can't remember, did the vet give you any pain reliever? Meloxicam is typically used. It might really help make him more comfortable. If not, you can use baby ibuprofen (for humans). That helps with selling/inflammation as well. Dosage is weight dependent so you will want to know how much he weighs, which might be in your paperwork from the vet, or give them a call and have them look at his records for his weight. Here's more info: http://ratguide.com/meds/nsaids/ibuprofen.php

As for the finances, honestly many of us are in the same position. Your initial bill was hefty for sure, and vet care can add up quickly. See if the vet offers payment plans. Many people also use Care Credit, which is a temporary credit card you can use for vet care and spread the payments out instead of requiring a lump sum upfront. See if the vet accepts Care Credit: https://www.carecredit.com/

As for a temporary cage, you don't need a whole new Critter Nation. I have an inexpensive hamster cage I use for quarantine or medical recovery. Small is okay for a single rat as long as he gets plenty of play time outside of the cage. Don't get a plastic one and don't use the wheel, but otherwise just grab one. Mine was under $30. If you get them neutered, they will need to be in a small confined space while they recover anyway. 

I know it's a common feeling to rehome or give a rat to a rescue because you're worried you can't provide, but honestly I think his best situation would be to stay with you. He's bonded to you and most rescues don't have a lot of financial resources for sick rats either. I'd look into alternate financing if possible and keep him at home. You are who he needs right now."
HumansBeingBros,fenammf,t1_fen94fh,1579280587.0,Agreed. People are going to give awards anyway. Might as well give a koala and help at the same time. Plus these things aren't mutually exclusive. Many redditors also donate directly to causes including fire-related ones.
RATS,fenaafd,t3_eq2tkc,1579280377.0,"I'm not sure about rat safe paint, but wood is a terrible material for a rat came. Even if you seal it, it Anson's urine and you'll never get the smell out, particularly if they chew on it. Plus wood cages often don't have enough ventilation, which can lead to a respiratory infection. I'd encourage you to look at a different type of cage."
RATS,fem8za1,t3_epucqi,1579244162.0,"I'm so sorry this happened. I can tell you're heartbroken. Neutering worked wonders for my aggressive boy. I highly recommend it for severe aggression. Know that it can take up to 4-6 weeks for the testosterone to completely leave a rat's system. I wouldn't put them back together until 6 weeks after surgery. Sometimes you may need to neuter both rats but often just neutering one solves the problem. I don't think rats carry grudges. It sounds like he attacked you out of fear. The fact that he's still coming to you and climbing on you means that he's still bonded to you. My guess would be that he has lost sight in the irritated eye and when you try to pick him up it's from an able where he can't quite see you and so instinctively reacts aggressively. Just give him some space for his eye to heal before trying to pick him up or pet him. There is definitely hope that this will get better. See about getting him neutered and if necessary, Honey too. Don't lose hope. There's a very good chance they'll be able to live together again in the future."

RATS,fej4xgs,t3_epevoy,1579157057.0,"It looks like an abscess. The antibiotics should help. When one of our guys had an abscess the vet recommended making a warm compress with a cotton ball and some warm water and holding it on the bump for as long as he lets you a few times a day. Eventually the abscess should come to a head on its own and burst, which is gross but not unhealthy. From there you just keep it clean and let it heal on its own slowly. I wouldn't rush him into surgery. See how the Baytril goes and use the warm compress a few times a day. I'm really glad you took him in despite the cost. You're a good rat parent."
