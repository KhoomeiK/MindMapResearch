bestoflegaladvice,fffartr,t1_ffeg7gq,1579879839.0,"My shelter used to let you view dogs that weren't up for adoption yet, and put your name on a list to adopt it. The day it went up for adoption, the first 5 on the list had to be there at open. Then they went down the list, first person got one on one time with the dog to decide if they wanted to adopt, if they didn't, second person and so on. If there was already a list, it would never be listed for adoption on the website. 

They don't do that anymore though. Now it's everyone lines up and rushes to pull the cage cards at open. Cage card in hand = first dibs. Unless it's a highly desirable dog (puppies) then there's usually a line formed at the counter for those."
bestoflegaladvice,fffa3j3,t1_ffee9w9,1579879407.0,"In my area unchipped dogs are only held for 3 days and then put up for adoption. Chipped dogs are held for 10 days.

But if the roommate lied and said the dog was his and owner surrendered there would be no reason to hold the dog at all, it would immediately be put in line to be spayed and put up for adoption.

And all intact dogs are required to be vaccinated, chipped, neutered, and licensed, paid for by the owner, (they must also pay for all medical issues treated) before they will give the dog back.

But I find it fishy that the shelter did not check the microchip and see that the name did not match to the ""owner"". Here they would have immediately called the number registered to the chip to verify.

I'm going out on a limb here, but have a feeling the dog was brought in terrible condition and they just don't want to give it back to the owner. Which still isn't their call. Or OP is leaving out a ton of information."

aww,ff37ssk,t1_ff34bsg,1579535724.0,"> There is a reason many (if not most) of the dogs in your local dog shelter are pitbull mixes.

The breeds that will be the most common in shelters will be whatever the most common breeds in the area are.
Which is why most shelters are full of pitbulls and chihuahuas.
My areas shelters are full of 1-2 year old German Shepherd mixes and huskies now. They are the most popular breeds in my area, and people get them as puppies, don't train/exercise them, and then get rid of them at about a year old."

BuyItForLife,fe92bmf,t1_fe6btaa,1578933377.0,"They are a great brand. Just very behind in the times of advertising, social media presence, and new products. Their plastic guard combs used to be widely used by all groomers, but metal guard combs are very popular now and they don't make any. 

I love their designer series nail clippers (the white ones) for cats and medium sized dogs. The orange ones I would only use on dogs over 60lbs.
I actually hate the red nail clippers because the design/angle of the blade, the cut nail pieces would stick to the blade and I would have to pull every single nail off that I clipped, which gets old real quick when you groom 8+ dogs a day. 

The red/yellow slickers, the metal teeth are too flimsy, but the gray ones are very stiff and perfect for general brushing and dematting. 

I never tried any of their shears, hair pullers are very generic across all brands, you just want a brand the won't rust."

dogs,fc95rrn,t3_egiu4r,1577547477.0,"I worked for Petsmart as a groomer for 10 years. 
I find it very unlikely that this is all of the story. Petsmart Corp does not fuck around. Did a store manager do this in retaliation? I would call HR and I guarantee they would fire him immediately. Otherwise, I would say there's more to the story, probably drama in the salon that people are sick of dealing with (number one issue of working in a salon. So much drama.) 

They have also installed cameras in all of the salons within the last year because they are cracking down on neglect and abuse on the salons. They are zero tolerance for any abuse whatsoever. They would have this all on camera. 

And to the comments saying they don't employ real Groomers, there is no regulation of dog groomers. ANYONE can pick up a pair of clippers and call themselves a groomer, even at a private shop. 
Petsmart groomers have to go to ""Grooming academy"" for a month and then groom something like 100 dogs (I don't remember exactly how many dogs) until they are considered fully trained.
Now the quality of their training varies GREATLY, and I definitely agree they promote a lot of bathers to groomers that IMO should never have been promoted, but this is going to vary greatly by store, just like it would at any private salon. We had plenty of quality groomers while I worked there. I was trained by a woman who was not trained by petsmart, and who had been grooming for over 20 years. 

You know why so many GOOD groomers work for Petsmart? Health insurance and guaranteed hours and vacation/sick pay. Something a lot of private shops can't offer. I was getting 4 weeks of vacation a year. 

If you want a to find a quality groomer, find one who has been grooming for over 5 years, has photos of their grooms, and talk to them. You can't clump all the groomers together over ones action. It's not fair to the thousands of groomers who work there."
