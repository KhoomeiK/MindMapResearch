Because every indication otherwise seems to be that Fenn was a late hold-out, and the script revisions happened explicitly because of her voicing her complaints (hence Final Dossier still leaning toward her as a hair dresser, IIRC, rather than the vague story in Season 3), which resulted in missing out on the location shooting in Snoqualmie.

As for the ring .. yeah .. uh .. I assume Briggs probably somehow found out about the plan and .. stole the ring .. and willingly swallowed it once he knew Mr. C was going to kill him imminently, as a hope that if he got murdered and his body was discovered by the FBI, they'd be able to track Dougie and maybe save Coop? Or .. was the Ring placed in there by Mr. C?

God, I'm overdue for a rewatch, I'm so fuzzy on all this stuff. But, I do remember those two points being big question marks and possibly just iffy and overcomplicated plotting."

I would’ve really liked a quick turn around on a new ReMake, if just to ensure tonal style and visual consistency with 2/3 and complete the OG trilogy. It’d be a bummer if by the time they get around to revamping the original, they’ve had to use different faces for the characters for some contract reasons or whatever issue that could crop up in say 5 years."
