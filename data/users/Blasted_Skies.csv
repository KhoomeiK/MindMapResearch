You could only buy games by going to a physical shop, and a lot of such shops had limited inventory. You also had to continually update your computer to play the latest games. The games I most enjoyed from that period were the older King's Quest, Lord of the Realms, Sim City, and Age of Empires. Great games, but still limited. And if you wanted to play your old DOS games? Unless you still had your 1988 IBM in working condition along with the physical disc  - forget about it. Today, you can go to Steam or GOG and find TONS of unique and interesting games, along with old games dating back decades, for basically any style of play and all updated to work on your modern computer.
