It’ll work the same as the lightning port, it just won’t come into your phone directly anymore. It’ll actually probably be easier to watch videos holding your phone or play games horizontally. It could also mean really simple to use, no additional parts necessary mobile charging packs that you also can just slap on the back of your phone while using. My problem is the headphone jacks.

That’s what I meant it mentions that amazon paying no taxes isn’t a result of the current tax plan, but it illustrates how the system allows them to leverage the tax code to pay no taxes. This IS the problem people are referring to. No one is saying amazon is sneakily not paying taxes owed... they’re just pointing out they’re leveraging the complexity of the tax code to owe no taxes. Nobody’s saying amazon’s committing tax evasion, just that the tax code allows them to escape liability through all their exemptions and pay no corp. taxes when they really should be."
