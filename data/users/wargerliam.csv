I got away, but at what cost?"

Basically it's exactly what your talking about. It varies from light scratches to deep gouges, hairline fractures to snapped bones (cut/Pierce vs. blunt), frostbite, burns, poisen and even sickness all treated through an MSG3 like menu. The effectiveness of your medical skill determined how well you treat the wound. At low levels you barely even notice the difference in minor cuts and scraps."

We will not punish you, since your crime is trying to join those who you truely are kindred with. Instead we welcome you into the fold. I only ask you make sure the other Jamies are okay with this, as you cannot be both a Jamie and a Liam...

We don't wish to claim war with the Jamies, we wouldn't want to steal one of theirs either for it is not our way. Perhaps you could be our the first Jamie ambassador and be the bridge between our two people's."

Like if you were a lawyer and these were all important documents relative to the cases your working on, it's clutter. But if your a lawyer and this is everything from Legos you haven't used in 10 years to half burnt cigars then it would be hoarding.

For instance the food in the foreground is clutter but wrapping paper and the bike on the floor is hoarding"
