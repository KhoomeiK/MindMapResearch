IncelTears,ffe3r8b,t1_ffd84or,1579835924.0,"It depends. For example, guys like Elliot Rodger never approached anybody. And he was spoiled by his parents. So, he never had to actually put in the effort to achieve anything. He also drove an expensive car and wore expensive clothing bought for him by his parents. And thought that girls would throw themselves at him just because he owned those things. Since none of that happened, he became really bitter and ended up killing women.

Alek Minassian another incel serialkiller is also described as a not sociable loner. But somehow he has this delusional self image of himself, because he describes himself as a ""super gentleman"", because he approached two girls at a party and got rejected. Even though he ""forgets"" that he murdered 10 people and injured another 16.

Both guys have/had a complete lack of self awareness. On top of that they don't have a friend or a family member who they can pour their hearts out to. Their social life is pretty much non-existent. The only social contact they have is with other incels online who have the same delusional and toxic mindset filled with bitterness, victimhood, and hatred towards women.

They don't have a healthy environment to talk about those feelings.

You have to ask yourself:

* Do other people ever invite you over to hangout?

* Do other people laugh at your jokes, do they perceive you as funny?

* Do other people call you nice?

* Do you have some sort of hobby, a job, or go to a place (which isn't a night club) where you get to meet new people from both genders to make new friends, but also to meet women?

* If you suck at meeting women, do you have friends who help you to meet them?

I could go on with these questions.

If you've noticed something about them, they aren't about how you perceive yourself. But how others perceive you. For example, people like to be around funny people. You can call yourself sociable, nice, and funny etc. But do others feel the same? A lot of incels for example call themselves ""nice"" guys. But nobody considers them nice. They just use it as a gimmick in the hopes to get laid.

And do you go to a place which isn't a nightclub where you can repetitively meet new people to improve your social skills with people of both genders and meet women.

Lastly, that last question is a reality check. Many incels think that they deserve to be together with models. So, if a good friend of you would hook you up with someone, what would that girl he/she hooked you up with look like. Trust me, it won't be a model."
IncelTears,ffd46ku,t1_ffccuwg,1579813079.0,"I think you're missing my point. If you never approach women. Don't complain that you're single. It's like complaining that you're unemployed. But never bother to apply for a job.

If that's what you're doing, it doesn't matter how much you shower or go to the gym. You're still going to be single/an incel.

That's what many incels who go to the gym just for the purpose to get laid realize. You going to the gym means jackshit if you never approach women.

And if height is really what's bothering you, go buy a pair of elevator shoes. I mean if women can wear high heels, why shouldn't you be able to wear elevator shoes.

But again, if you just buy elevator shoes and don't approach anybody. It's a waste of money, because women rarely approach men on their own.

And yes, you can call it unfair that men have to put in most of the effort especially in the beginning, but it is what it is. You can either get mad about it and keep staying single. Or try to make the best out of it."
