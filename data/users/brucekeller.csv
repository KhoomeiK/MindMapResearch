Bench kind of shows results the quickest aesthetically, but deadlifts and squats are where you are going to become truly powerful. Your hip abductors are probably going to be weak as hell, which will impact your squats, so I'd also get one of those hip rings and start doing some of the various exercises like moving side to side with it, or using it while you are squating light and intentionally push your knees out.  That was my biggest weakness when I started really squatting, plus I'd get delayed onset muscle soreness for like a whole week after a squat session for the first few months.   
When you're squatting, make sure your knees are not bending inward, lower the load until you can keep them straight or pointing out.  You're just asking for injuries if you're squatting but having knee valgus."

beginnerfitness,fejeujp,t3_epgcjk,1579170717.0,"Are you talking about just bench press?

If you want to get strong, focus on learning the main compound lifts correctly: Bench, Squat, Deadlift, and overhead press.

You'll get the most gains from all of those.  Then learn about accessory work to do with the major lifts to fill out your workout day.

Most lifters do a bro split, which is basically having a chest day, back day, leg day.

So on a chest day for instance, you might do bench press, incline dumb bell press, overhead press, pec flys, some cable work like tricep pulldowns, pushups until failure to cap off the chest work, and then maybe some facepulls to work the back a little so your posture doesn't get wrecked.

I'd start low and slow, concentrate mainly on 3x10 but maybe 5x5 for something like the squats and deadlifts and keep at it.

There's way too much information on the subject to dump into this, but thankfully we have youtube and people on there like Athlean-X, Scott Herman Fitness, and Jeff Nippard.  I'd look into those channels and you'll learn a lot and hopefully also learn to not get injured, which is really most important, because if you're injured, you're not working out!"

pics,fe6r99p,t1_fe6qfb7,1578901630.0,"Everything I'd read for a guy almost always points back to weightlifting, especially getting good at the major compound lifts.  The more muscle you get, the more fat you burn. Steady state cardio is meh, and HIIT until you've been conditioning yourself can be kind of rough. If you wanted an expert way to do it, I'd even throw down some money on an Athlean-X program so you can do it without getting injured.

In terms of food, I'd really just lay off the carbs. I'm 165 lbs now, and I've been eating 4-5k calories a day for 7ish months now and gained 25 lbs, but it was almost all muscle. My body fat percentage actually went down. When I get to 180 or so I'll probably level off at 3k calories a day, but the reason I'm not gaining much fat is that basically I just eat two types of carbs, white rice and potatoes... sometimes pizza, but basically rice and potatoes are my only substantial carbs. Outside of that, it's steaks, bison, and veggies.  Very high protein.   I also try to load up the most carbs before I'm about to go burn them at the gym and I'll drink something sugary while lifting to replace the glycogen.

But just cutting down the carbs to some that are easy to process(by the way, that will also really help you with inflammation, I used to have carpal tunnel when I ate bread daily) and lifting heavy in a program is basically all you need to do.  I do take some supplements like bromelain and quercetin to make sure I'm digesting the high protein/fat diet easily though, and drink lots of kombucha / unflavored kefir.

Having high muscle percentage as a guy also leads to a longer and more mobile life, which is kind of ultimately what we really want right?

Edit: I’d research some of my statements for sure, ignore the downvotes... knocking carbs like bread on reddit is like saying you hate kittens or support Trump. They’re probably mad because of some pain from chronic inflammation. :D"

Once I started eating more plus the weights etc, I felt like a different person. 

Once you  get to your ideal body type, just doing real weight lifting alone with a little cardio will allow you to eat a more substantial diet and keep that T up because you'll be burning so much fat via the muscle.   If you aren't already, might want to get some blood work every so often just to be on the safe side so you don't run into a strange problem."

Also, start working out and lifting weights. That's one of the easiest ways to build confidence, boost testosterone, and become more physically attractive for sure. I recently went from being scrawny to fairly muscular over the last 6 months, and I can tell you it's made all the difference."
