offmychest,ferf2ta,t3_eq7tej,1579353154.0,Well at least your country doesn't force you into military service cuz I feel the exact same way you do about my country but im also legally forced to serve in the army for two years
Guitar,fepyrqu,t3_eqa03a,1579334861.0,Idk about what airline you'll be taking but I travelled with guitars through Europe and tbh never had a problem even when putting it in the baggage area. The front desk people usually give me a tag to put it in the pressurised area where dogs and bikes and other random items go. Even travelled with a soft gigbag and it was completely fine
offmychest,femsinf,t3_epyh9h,1579268362.0,Dude he'll go to Oxford escape his parent's grasp smoke a bunch of weed and drop out seen it happen to half my classmates who were exactly that type of student

youseeingthisshit,fdg9wjv,t3_ekwwkk,1578386383.0,Can confirm. It's either dry like that or so watery af cuz we ran out of potatoes
offmychest,fd7auvs,t3_ek1ht9,1578201715.0,Bruh I always wanted curly hair. Guess the grass is always greener on the neighbors lawn
offmychest,fd1o7ue,t3_ejqj04,1578134172.0,Tfw you're already a draftee in a middle Eastern country where military service is compulsory
worldnews,fcytvi5,t3_ejfywx,1578086970.0,"Isn't it crazy how America can just swing it's dick around saying you're a terrorist and just fucking drop a bomb on you and no one can say shit to them back. I mean shit everyone thinks the russians are cold blooded murders but hey at least when they do assassinations they don't just drop a fucking bomb on you killing a bunch of other people along the way. But noooooo America is the land of the free home of the big Mac BK have it your way eat fresh consumerist hellscape that can get away with anything. I mean at least the russians get punished with sanctions, the US can basically say uhmm I don't like you so fuck you catch a bomb bruv and then when asked for why they did that say well we think he's a bad guy so we sent our fucking planes to a sovereign country and basically bombarded their land killing a top military  official along the way cuz we felt like it. Also fuck you."

offmychest,fcy0g0f,t1_fcy07eo,1578072982.0,Yeah it really ain't that bad don't worry about it too much. When you do just think that everybody else is worried too. Also you get to be on a mighty fine high ass horse when you talk to ppl that dodged the draft
offmychest,fcxzb8y,t1_fcxvm4k,1578072517.0,Well I hope you smoke cuz the the best conversations happen late at night when you're on guard duty and another soldier comes up to you to chat about life over a cigarette. You'll meet a bunch of people and unless you're in a war like state like my country where you have to go to outposts it'll be like a shitty two year gap year. You will get fit tho weather you like it or not which is nice too
offmychest,fcxv6sr,t3_ejgays,1578070906.0,"Hey, I'm also currently in the army because of forced military conscription. Tbh tbh it's not that bad since all of us are fucking miserable and hate being here so there's a tight friendship with everyone at the base. Yeah it sucks but hey two years worth of stupid stories will come out of it"

Guitar,fcqdcnb,t3_eifd12,1577883762.0,Idk about the squiers but I've owned a MiM fender 60s special edition and it sounded and played absolutely beautifully. I bought it used too so unless there is a serious issue with it go for the second hand MiM
Guitar,fcqcw9a,t3_eidkuq,1577883503.0,"I'd go for the vintera strat, I've owned a PRS SE 24 and tbh it really didn't vibe with me, I sold it and got a Mexican made 60s strat and just fell in love. So just going from personal experience get a vintera, fender makes beautiful instruments and they sound amazing"
pokemon,fcqc355,t3_eid8hk,1577883055.0,"Platinum was my first game too, never managed to beat it back then and never got around to trying again. Maybe I should give it a try now that I now that I can't solo with my starter lmao"
Guitar,fcqbhaw,t3_eidt2v,1577882722.0,I've had a fender champion 20 and tbh for the price it's definitely a good amp. I bought it personally because it had vibrato as a built in effect which is pretty sweet. It's got auto wah and other more commonly used effects too. I'd say go for the fender the cleans are nice and the crunch blues tones aren't bad either
Guitar,fcq7s6v,t3_ei8ivk,1577880544.0,Absolutely gorgeous instant n u t
offmychest,fcnm68h,t3_ei0yv2,1577814133.0,"I dropped out of law school when I was in a similar predicament. The only difference being that from where I'm from we have forced military draft for all 18+ males for two years. Tbh after a disastrous year in university where I basically became a drug addict due to the stress and self hatred over failing only halfway through the year. Tbh tho when I got drafted I hadn't told my parents yet, I told them a month into my service and they took it better than I thought. Maybe being in forced service helped soften the blow in a way but they didn't disown me the way I thought they would. Idk the army in itself at least for me has become a weird form of safe space because for two years nobody gives a shit about your smarts. As long as you can walk and hold your gun right you're as good as anyone. The general camaraderie and shared hatred of being there amongst the other conscripts gave me a nice sense of community too. Haven't been on drugs for like 6 months either so that's nice. Maybe try to find a safe mental space within a job where you'll have time to figure out your life like I did in the army. Don't join it tho if you don't have to cuz it sucks in the grand scheme of thing"
