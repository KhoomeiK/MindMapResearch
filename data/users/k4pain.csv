 Personally we should be building buildings out of hemp because it is actually stronger then timber.

 You shouldn't be using any bags at all you should have a reusable one that you continue to use over and over and over and you don't get any bags to the grocery store.

 We should all have a metal straw or some straw that is washable and we won't have to get any straws from the restaurant's.

I'm confused...."
Futurology,fftj3nw,t3_ev1n2p,1580221885.0,WHAT ABOUT HEMP?
gifs,fftj1p2,t1_ffqq0i6,1580221844.0,I don't.  He's replaceable.   I just don't think that it's a great idea to have your employees trying to cover up someone's phone. It could cause a fight and a lawsuit. They get enough business from people honestly buying the photos. I don't think the manager is asking the employees to get up right in the customer's face and cover their phone. I certainly don't think he'll get fired for not covering someone's phone in an aggressive manner.

gifs,ffq69ii,t1_ffpzhdl,1580122764.0,You really think they're going to fire him because he didn't try to put his hand in front of somebody's phone trying to take a picture of a TV screen?
DMT,ffm3bfs,t3_eu72yz,1580047796.0,"Found on the science subreddit.  I'm not sure if you guys know anything about the science subreddit but the comments and posts are strictly enforced and regulated.  It is very exciting that many scientists and doctors around the world, especially John Hopkins University, are studying psychedelics and the benefits of taking them. I believe that within 20 to 30 years psychedelics will answer many questions that have gone on answered for many years.

 I see a new article on psychedelics on the science or futurology subreddit almost once or twice a week and it is very optimistic for me!"
