You only perceive it as “discrimination” because your culture finds it appropriate. Many of the rest of us see premarital sex being pushed on us as an act of western cultural imperialism. I can very well turn things around and call certain western norms “discrimination” against your people, and you would find my analysis bizarre.

worldnews,ffai64b,t1_ffahf84,1579736304.0,"> The fact that you ~~require~~ desire your abuser to provide for you in that scenario is beyond f*cked up.

You keep removing the victim’s perspective from all of this. In countries where these customs are prevalent, women often see this as a desirable solution to the injustice they’ve faced. Getting the perpetrator to marry you is a form of retribution exacted *against* the perpetrator *by* the victim. On top of being punitive, it can solve the victim’s existing trouble of getting married anyway.

> You shouldn't be trapped into something, no matter your culture.

The best implementations of such laws ultimately make it the victim’s the final word as to whether she wants to pursue this arrangement."
worldnews,ffacf6m,t1_ffabns0,1579732248.0,"> Imagine ~~having to~~ getting to marry the guy that raped you as a child.

Somebody raping you and tossing you by the wayside is profoundly evil and disrespectful—we can both agree on that. No amount of punishment can undo that trauma and hurt.

But if there were a way to get that person to permanently be made to provide for you, care for you, house you, attend to your health, absorb your financial debts, and help raise your family, many women *want* that sort of recourse. It may appear strange to westerners, especially in societies where concepts such as “dating” and premarital relationships exist, but is incredibly common elsewhere."

As I said before, this *is* a form of punishment against the criminal. Do you think providing for another person for your whole life is cheap or easy?"
worldnews,ffab6v7,t1_ffaar4e,1579731477.0,"> Or you could just give them a prison sentence and garnish their wages instead.
