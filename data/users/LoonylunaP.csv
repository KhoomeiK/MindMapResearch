youseeingthisshit,fdijefe,t1_fdigwhf,1578444241.0,Tom Hanks woke up to see that his stock fell 98% overnight.
AskDocs,fdiejgg,t3_elgsle,1578441112.0,I've had that my whole life. I'm now in my 40s. I've seen doctors and psychiatrists.  They all say it's Tourette's Syndrome. I find getting my needed sleep and not letting myself get too stressed helps a lot. I've sometimes gone a few years without a tic. But today I did it all morning. My daughter gets really embarrassed and that makes me feel bad. But I also have a great job and successful life that I'm proud of. It sucks but it's not that bad.
TrueOffMyChest,fdidd7z,t3_elhtv2,1578440348.0,Even though it makes you feel good you should probably let it be free. I imagine the worm is very unhappy without some dirt to crawl through.
ABoringDystopia,fdfpsad,t1_fdfpep5,1578367292.0,That's because none of this is funny. It's really really bad. We don't have the time to be distracted by stupid jokes anymore.
Damnthatsinteresting,fdfox37,t1_fdfnyq2,1578366716.0,If you put my face or your face next to a photo of Lincoln there would be no similarity. These two men look alike.
CasualUK,fdfnhyj,t1_fdep5wc,1578365782.0,The Newport in America is silent streets lined with grand estates. It's a ghost town of billionaires too afraid to go outdide.
TheMorningShow,fdfle2e,t1_fdfiytm,1578364404.0,"I think Jennifer Aniston is amazingly beautiful. She has a unique look. Big deal. I want to see her real face even if the cigarettes and years are showing. 
 What possible justification can they give for altering the faces of these women? They are actors. They need to be able to express their emotions."
TheMorningShow,fdfhzip,t1_fdfh7o4,1578362141.0,They aren't doing it on the men. Whoever decided to mess with these women's faces should be ashamed of themselves.
funny,fdffnim,t1_fdf4u81,1578360585.0,We celebrate Tom Hanks for not being a rapist. The bar is so low.
intermittentfasting,fdfese6,t3_ekwkkw,1578360001.0,You look great
AskOldPeople,fdfb7dq,t3_ekxt3t,1578357589.0,I left my hometown at 15. I was raped by a local 22 year old man. Everyone was angry at me because I wouldn't shut up about it. I left and I never went back. It was a tiny town in New Mexico and I used to drive by the road that lead there from time to time. The last time I was there was 8 years ago. I had my infant daughter asleep in her car seat and a new husband sitting next to me in the passengers seat. I drove through without saying a word about where we were. I didn't even touch the brakes. I won't ever go back. I live in London now.
NatureIsFuckingLit,fdf76sw,t1_fde4nrf,1578354888.0,This isn't a painting???
TheMorningShow,fdf6di6,t3_el2ee9,1578354343.0,Her eyes are naturally unusual. Too close together and off center. But in this show they are using some rediculous blurring technique because they think we don't want to look at a 50 year old woman.
ABoringDystopia,fdeiu0o,t1_fde8s85,1578339945.0,I think you might be missing the point. The situation that we find ourselves in today is not Jimmy Carter's fault. Every leader must work from the platform his predecessors left him. We all have to make decisions based on our current reality. My predecessor in my job hired a bunch of his friends. I wouldn't have done that if I had been in the job at the time. But...If I decided to fire every one of them tomorrow the fallout from that would be my fault. It's not ok to say he isn't responsible for the actions he took.
CasualUK,fde4xxr,t3_ekts2f,1578331274.0,"I just took 9 days off and woke up this morning with a wicked cold. I have a 9:00 meeting scheduled with my boss tomorrow morning. 
She has a zero tolerance policy on coming to work sick. She gets irrationally angry when she hears a cough or sneeze.  We have important things we need to sort out. Things that have to be done tomorrow.  I'm fucked."
ABoringDystopia,fde289u,t1_fddui4h,1578329533.0,They are literally blaming Jimmy Carter.
TwoXChromosomes,fddv9sc,t1_fddtea3,1578324834.0,"I had my daughter in the UK. We are provided with a dedicated midwife but we also get an obstetrician. He checked in on me twice. One thing I do remember is that he suggested that I eat something. My husband tried to give me a protein bar from my go bag. I threw it on the floor. 
I think they all thought I was pretending and acting crazy. 
Maybe if the doctor had been there the entire time he might have noticed. I dialated from 2cm to 10cm in less than 4 hours."
ABoringDystopia,fddubfd,t1_fddou8x,1578324164.0,"There is nothing to be ashamed of in that hope you felt. The morning after he was elected I dropped off my daughter at school. She waved at me with a big smile on her face. 6 years old. Half way down the block and tears were streaming down my face. You and I both thought everyone wanted, deep down, to make things better. We were wrong.
 I discovered over the following months and years that I had something valuable inside me. I want a better world and I won't compromise. Every day at work somebody tries to convince me to make an exception, to ignore it just this one time. 'Let's take the easy road' they say. I never back down. The election of Donald Trump has resulted in two promotions, an extra Â£33K per year and the gift of knowing what means something to me."
RoomPorn,fddrywl,t1_fdcwx6z,1578322434.0,"I could get into that. Here I am in a glass room, my legs are spread. I look up and there is a giant animal staring at me."
TwoXChromosomes,fddjde4,t1_fdde26b,1578314608.0,"When I was in labour I was in so much pain that I thought I was screaming but I was actually whispering ""something is wrong, something is wrong"". I was completely disassociated. Something was actually really wrong but they didn't believe me until it was almost too late. We both lived but it was a close call. My midwife came by my hospital room a few days after and apologised."
OldSchoolCool,fddi4u0,t3_ekoofg,1578313239.0,This photo is captures the idea of what an American man should be.
space,fdcnro9,t3_ekltpm,1578279498.0,They will think it was all a fertility ritual. They will be right.
SuccessionTV,fdcn7o3,t3_ekmjsh,1578279098.0,Experiment successful. I'm interested in becoming a Meth head.
GenX,fdcm9s6,t3_ekj01q,1578278427.0,I can confirm that I don't give a shit.
space,fdcklpc,t3_ekn4gw,1578277232.0,"Obviously it's a terrible idea to introduce an invasive species. If it's not a human there is no reason to go. We could cause chaos on another world, theoretically, but it just seems cruel. Cockroaches?? We might as well just give up if that is our grand plan."
SuccessionTV,fdcif5b,t3_ekmipt,1578275683.0,That is great news! Well deserved.
ABoringDystopia,fdb0nfe,t1_fda0nno,1578252364.0,I will vote for Bernie but he needs to get pragmatic. I live in London and just watched Jeremy Corbin crash and burn in spectacular fashion. We need plans that make sense and don't require faith. We need to know the how and the why.
cats,fdaxv52,t3_ek8pux,1578251667.0,He's so grumpy!
LegalAdviceUK,fd9bx27,t3_ekalw3,1578231261.0,My ex-husband went through a period of ranting and raving. He threatened everything and it scared me. I was saving text messages and voicemails and was on the phone with my lawyer twice a week. But here we are 6 years later and I couldn't be happier with our co-parenting relationship. Everyone else has provided good advice but I want to remind you to stop and take a breath. Remember that your goal is to raise a happy child.
ABoringDystopia,fd97zb5,t1_fd87nr6,1578229676.0,"That is exactly what I was saying. For the record, the neighbour girl is amazingly advanced in her mathmatics. She probably teaches my daughter more than the tutor does. Her english and reading is not as good because they don't speak english at home. I usually work with her on her reading for about 30 minutes after the tutor leaves. 
I want both of these little girls to have good lives."
ABoringDystopia,fd960tl,t1_fd88s1s,1578228919.0,"I know. The world is so broken and the US is responsible for too much of it. I just notice that this one particular incident has made a lot of people very angry. Because Hillary Clinton laughed about it. 
I care about the Native women, I care about women in Saudi Arabia. I don't care about Gaddafi."
datingoverthirty,fd94jry,t3_ek4zh9,1578228216.0,If social media is in the profile or mentioned in initial conversations I just move on. It's a huge turn off for me. I'm a grown woman and I can't be with someone that cares about that nonsense.
JUSTNOMIL,fd92m6q,t3_ek7wx3,1578227473.0,"This doesn't have anything to do with your situation but this post reminded me of the time my Dad's ex-girlfriend's Mom hired a private investigator to look into him. She must have hired the bargain basement guy because this PI was so fucking obvious. He parked right across the street every day for two weeks. We used to wave at him from the front room which would cause him to slump down in his seat. Finally, my Dad got fed up with it because the man followed him to work. He walked out to the car and invited him in for a coffee. The PI drove off and never came back."
ABoringDystopia,fd7xl68,t1_fd7rvi0,1578211526.0,I'm a very forgiving person. I believe that almost everybody can be redeemed if they ask for forgiveness and change. But not Gaddafi.  This guy was the worst person. There are 1000s of families that still cry at night because of his actions. If I had the power to kill he would be the type of person I would kill.
ABoringDystopia,fd7v0la,t1_fd7rlew,1578210544.0,"I also wonder when you are going to start executing the living Presidents? The answer is  -  probably never. If we want a President dead, we can't count on you."
ABoringDystopia,fd7tbaj,t1_fd7rped,1578209772.0,I know that is true.
ABoringDystopia,fd7sisf,t1_fd7kilm,1578209420.0,"You're right. It was not my call. It was her call. She decided to facilitate his death. I would have probably done the same. At the time, the Arab spring was still a hopeful dream. Most of us thought they had a chance. Lesson learned."
ABoringDystopia,fd7o0b6,t1_fd7kgky,1578207419.0,I was just joking around. I don't want anyone to put themselves in a bad situation. A good job is important and real. Knowing that you deserve that job is actually priceless.  I guess the point I was trying to make was that the rules are not fair and there are a lot of people that are getting away with being totally full of shit. I never graduated from highschool. I was assaulted at school at 16 and never went back. I have a BA and an MBA. I just lied about graduating and nobody ever checked.
AskOldPeople,fd7lkv3,t1_fd7i5dm,1578206359.0,It's a terrible situation. I feel like I'm screaming into the void. I honestly want to make things better and I care about these men. I work with good people that are great at their jobs but even I get tired. They are working in their dream jobs. When we have an open position we get about 500 real applicants. Everybody wants to do what these guys do. But for some reason they are always in my office crying. I can't blame the CEO. The CEO doesn't think about us. It's not my fault either. I really think it's a societal problem.
ABoringDystopia,fd7hgeb,t1_fd7bqd1,1578204575.0,Gaddafi was a horrible person. He blew up an airplane full of innocent people. It took nearly a year to find all the pieces of those people. He crushed anyone and everyone that defied him. He deserved his death and you only care that she laughed? He had to go.
london,fd7eqy4,t1_fd7dkr3,1578203328.0,That's disappointing but I'm sure we will enjoy the museum anyway. My daughter is in the McQueen year 3 project. We are going to find her class photo.
AskOldPeople,fd7cgra,t1_fckkjzr,1578202341.0,"You are absolutely right. Things are not going well for men these days. I work in a field that is 85% men. I look out at our staff and it's men from wall to wall. We as managers, talk all the time about how to get more women in. But our women keep leaving and the reason they tell me they are leaving is because the men they work with are emotional wrecks. The men are mean and sad and angry. The women get fed up a  just quit.
The women leave and get better jobs. The men never consider leaving as a possibility.  Maybe it's because of the head of household thing.   Maybe it's for a reason I can't understand. I don't know. Men do need to sort it out for themselves because Women can't do this for them."
ABoringDystopia,fd77qm6,t1_fd75hlq,1578200528.0,I will always be grateful for the illusion of peace and freedom of the 90s. I am lucky to have lived in a fantasy. The world wasn't actually any safer. Life was much worse for women and children that needed help. Sexual abuse wasn't taken seriously. Boys and Men were not allowed to express themselves. It was actually a big mess but the difference was that we got through it together.
offmychest,fd74yp2,t3_ek6u5r,1578199496.0,I hear you.
ABoringDystopia,fd6z8z1,t1_fd6gro1,1578197555.0,"Nobody can afford a house so you can join us in feeling shit about that. The Climate wars are coming.  A billion people are going to heading towards you. We can hold political beliefs all day long. We can even be extreme in those beliefs but it only means something if you forget that our home is becoming uninhabitable.
There is one thing that I would recommend. Make a fake resume, apply for jobs you aren't qualified for and pretend you know what you are doing. It's all a big joke so you might as well play along."
CasualUK,fd6vunl,t3_ek1g84,1578196375.0,"My ex-MIL is in failing health. She used to make a Christmas Trifle every year. When my ex-husband arrived on Christmas morning and handed me the Tesco Trifle he said ""My mum can't make these anymore"". I had to catch my breath and hold back tears. I promised it would be my job from now on."
london,fd6u2iq,t3_ek4ff2,1578195716.0,We are going on Monday. I'm really looking forward to it.
ABoringDystopia,fd6s9ao,t1_fd6h2k0,1578195082.0,"Imagine if someone told us we couldn't go to the moon? Why are pretending to be so weak? Other countries are going to the moon now but they didn't go when mankind didn't know if it was even possible. They didn't risk anything. 
And here America sits too afraid to trust our government to provide for a healthy and thriving population. It's sad."
ABoringDystopia,fd6r2mk,t1_fd6iyzn,1578194676.0,The thing about us Gen-xers is that you couldn't pay us enough to care.  The advertising they tried on us when we were young was so rediculous that we are as close as one can get to immune.
ABoringDystopia,fd6plvv,t1_fd6h6zl,1578194178.0,My daughter shares a tutor with her Iraqi neighbour. She's 8 and she is doing a great job being a kid. We aren't concerned. We only agreed to this arrangement because the neighbours couldn't afford the tutor on their own. The neighbour girl is terrified that she won't get in to the best secondary school. Her older brother scored 2 points too low. My daughter is going to be fine either way. Because my daughter is not an Iraqi living in England.
ABoringDystopia,fd6nslo,t1_fd69rx8,1578193563.0,"I was in DC on 9/11. I watched the second plane hit on the TV in the lobby. I went to my office, grabbed my purse and left. My boss was yelling about not being allowed to leave. I was the only one who left. But when I got home I turned on the TV and watched the buildings collapse. It broke me. I have never felt safe since that day. The world is not what it was."

relationships,fd6hbf2,t3_ek6ieu,1578191016.0,She crossed the line. She was too cruel and too mean. I'm so sorry this happened to you. Your weight has nothing to do with your value as a friend. I think you have to stop being friends with her. Close your eyes and imagine 5 friends you haven't met yet. Would these future friends like her? They would tell you to leave her in the past.

TrueOffMyChest,fd2e9e1,t3_eju6l1,1578145962.0,Those people are so unimportant when you think about it. We are here for a blink of an eye. You have noted that you aren't like them and now you can go out in the world in kindness.
offmychest,fd1zdji,t3_ejuxbw,1578139192.0,I once found a paper crane in the Spy Museum in DC. It had a website written on it. I logged it and then left it at The Tate Modern in London. Never heard from again.
