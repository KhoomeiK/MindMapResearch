SuicideWatch,fffdx8w,t1_ffec5py,1579881832.0,Sorry I fell asleep last night. I guess I’m feeling a little bit better
SuicideWatch,ffe9xog,t1_ff7q2v5,1579840782.0,Maybe I will. That's the thing about life. It's warily unpredictable. Sorry about your parents. You deserve unconditional love. My ex gave up on me too so I feel that.
selfharm,ffdnfn6,t3_et18t6,1579824600.0,I am so sorry. Losing someone you love is so hard. I've been through it too. You were an amazing friend to him. I can tell because even after his passing you are making sure he is remembered.  I know the urge to cut is strong. I've been there too. Try and focus on the memories the two of you made together--the happy memories. Please don't cut. You can get through this. Stay strong.
SuicideWatch,fcmikvh,t1_fcmijdz,1577776722.0,Thank you
AskReddit,fcm4tt1,t1_fcm47ag,1577764265.0,Honestly got no clue
AskReddit,fcm4t76,t1_fcm43h4,1577764251.0,Those are beautiful thoughts
SuicideWatch,fcm4qfz,t3_ehlm8x,1577764195.0,Do you ever feel like a burden to your friends because you feel like you bother them too much with all the suicide talk? I just started this reddit because I’ve attempted twice now and both attempts have failed. I feel like I can’t talk to my friends because they either don’t respond or act like they don’t care
SuicideWatch,fcm3xax,t3_ehosf3,1577763597.0,Same here
AskReddit,fcm3uzk,t1_fcm3o0g,1577763548.0,I don’t think it believes in me either. Maybe it’s just a facade
