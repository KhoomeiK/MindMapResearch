Google Account that we use for most stuff
Schoology (LMS)
Lunch code (everyone sees you punch it in)
Powerschool
TurnItIn
School-issued computers
and many more! Also includes sensitive data!

Fun part is, theoretically, you could log into someone's schoology account, send an inappropriate message to a teacher, which will probably get them suspended or expelled.
