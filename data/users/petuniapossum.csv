Catsmirin,ff8001h,t3_erxdp1,1579662444.0,"That’s quite the gaze,  thought I was in r/supermodelcats for a minute"
Showerthoughts,ff7xj0f,t3_es3xix,1579660715.0,Yep.  I only started to overcome it when I got into customer service jobs where I do have a script.  Proving to myself I could talk to strangers and sound confident was the first step.
curledfeetsies,ff6mxt6,t3_erve8w,1579630625.0,This is so beautiful.  I love him
satanism,ff4cyq8,t1_ff43dr6,1579560684.0,I believe the same.  This is a beautiful description

MergeDragons,fepjsge,t1_fepdta4,1579322323.0,"Welcome back lol.  You’re welcome, sorry  I couldn’t be more specific though"
MergeDragons,fepjlyg,t1_felwx4f,1579322188.0,This is the best I’ve heard it explained.  Thank you!
MergeDragons,fepd2vh,t1_feomil8,1579317545.0,"I’ve been playing for a year,  I remember the 2 crimson dragons.  I liked having 2 of the same speed and they were pretty quick.  It’s been several months since they changed,  I’m not sure exactly though"
MergeDragons,fenwgin,t3_eq51ui,1579291876.0,That’s awesome.  It was the first time I tried to do it and it was pretty easy so I’m really glad I did it
MergeDragons,fenw42t,t3_eq5lxj,1579291733.0,"Me too!  My first time!  I didn’t think to try it until seeing people do it here.  Made it kind of a nice puzzle in the beginning too,  to make it more interesting"

Autoimmune,fehgc56,t3_ep2tgn,1579115962.0,"It does sound like you could possibly have hypothyroidism,  which is also often under diagnosed.  If you can,  get a full thyroid panel,  not just TSH which was all my doctor ordered for years.  You want Free T3, Free T4, thyroid antibodies, and reverse T3 if you can get it,  as well as TSH.  In the United States,  in most states you can order your own tests if your doctor doesn’t want to.  It’s probably best to find a doctor who will,  though,  because they’ll know how to treat it better of course.  Thyroid treatment is improving,  but most doctors are still working with old information"
Showerthoughts,feft8or,t1_fefn3dj,1579064496.0,There are undergarments designed for this issue

MergeDragons,fefakts,t1_feegpnf,1579052066.0,Good idea
SupermodelCats,fedaua6,t1_fecwd86,1579006030.0,"I agree.  I don’t mind that it’s a repost,  but the title is such a blatant lie"
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fed4er1,t1_fecsyr9,1578998297.0,"Yes,  I think it does"
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fecs8eg,t1_fecp7p4,1578982637.0,"Hey,  I heard some people use digital light for candle gazing meditations,  if you feel inclined you might be able to just find a video of a candle flame instead.  Sometimes magic is just about what’s going on in your mind and experience,  and it’s not as important to have the physical objects,  but also if you have a nice shiny rock,  enjoy that too :)"
cuteguyswithcats,fecaup6,t3_eoee0p,1578969795.0,Cute!!
MergeDragons,febek9u,t1_fe9rrxy,1578958057.0,"Same here.  I got some ducks because they’re cute,  and then when I saw here what the second tier of life dragons is I started getting those chests when I had quests for it.  Those second tier life dragons are my favorites now"

witchcraft,fdps4gw,t1_fdnby3c,1578638362.0,"In some parts of the world,  it will be the afternoon and the moon will be on the other side of the planet at that time.  It only lasts for a few hours,  so if it doesn’t happen to be nighttime in your area you won’t be able to see it.  During a full moon the moon rises near the time the sun sets and sets near the time the moon rises.  Lunar eclipses always happen on full moons so it needs to happen at night in your area to see it"
ntbdbiwdfta,fdp9d1h,t1_fdp8spe,1578623052.0,Awww you have several cute cats!  They’re great.  Thank you! ❤️ ❤️

CozyPlaces,fdogsm1,t1_fdo3x6z,1578604842.0,Why is this the only comment you’ve replied to?  You could tell people where you got the rug or whatever

Thisismylifemeow,fdnznl9,t3_em74g8,1578596100.0,My cat used to turn one of his own ears inside out while grooming and I would have to flip the other one for symmetry
Catswhoyell,fdnyodu,t1_fdni04f,1578595530.0,"That’s what I wondered.  My cat and I are so lucky our vet is directly across the street,  closer than any other business to our home."
specializedtools,fdi3vyw,t1_fdgldmq,1578435275.0,"Me too.  Nice cat,  and good video all around so I’m glad the cat comment got me to watch it"
Thisismylifemeow,fdgbzhp,t3_ekuf38,1578389330.0,I’m required to leave my blinds open at all times and a permanent seat for the cat by the window.  It’s not enough.  I am also required to carry His Royal Majesty outside so he can survey his kingdom
CuddlyKitties,fdcwvv7,t3_eko9k9,1578286681.0,They’re so cuddly!
MergeDragons,fdaaxn6,t3_ekc8mz,1578243889.0,"I’m excited because I had 4 of those eggs from a previous event but that’s it,  no dragons in the chain,  so these eggs let me finally make onesie dragons!"

ntbdbiwdfta,fd7vapa,t1_fd7s5de,1578210670.0,"I remember us chatting a little about our cats before.  ButtButt is so very memorable.  Great name,  absolutely gorgeous cat.  It’s really made me smile hearing about his heroics and how he got his name.  You seem like an awesome person who deserves this awesome cat in your life"

MergeDragons,fct9q9b,t3_ehi3si,1577936672.0,I’ve said “ope” before and wondered where it came from.  My family is from the midwest and I was born there so it makes sense.  Interesting
MergeDragons,fcozyed,t1_fcoz8i1,1577846286.0,"I only did a 3 merge for my first tree,  too.  I didn’t know about bubbling and space was just nuts for me waiting for 5s.  Next time you can do 5!"
MergeDragons,fcozus1,t1_fcob0c6,1577846201.0,"Yeah!  They do it quite often,  too!  I don’t even need moon chests any more (but I do them sometimes for fun) because I have enough watermelon trees to just continuously merge blue life flowers."

WitchesVsPatriarchy,fcjeb8t,t1_fcj15bk,1577684574.0,I had a relationship like that for over a decade.  Would also recommend

That just really struck me that you said that is something you like to do,  I guess makes me feel good and less alone with my issue.  I stared at that leaf while promising myself I just was not going to look away until I felt ok again and it was like a little piece of safety.  I just wanted to thank you for sharing your good advice and reminding me how I survived that"

ImaginarySliceOfLife,fc3i062,t1_fc39e6l,1577390233.0,When I visited Morocco I wore a button down shirt and had no problems.  I didn’t tuck it up under my boobs and expose my midriff though so maybe that had something to do with it
ImaginarySliceOfLife,fc3hja6,t1_fc3gyji,1577389933.0,"Thank you,  I didn’t realize that.  I think you did a good job sounding non confrontational; you’re right,  it’s not easy"
MergeDragons,fc1kdw2,t1_fc15ga5,1577321385.0,It’s great!  Thanks for sharing it with us!  I would be really happy if my husband got me one too

aww,fbtizgq,t3_eec3l5,1577080626.0,"Every time I see one of these cats I think about how all cats look like this under their fur.  I’m extra careful brushing my cat now because I finally realize his skin isn’t smooth under there,  it’s wrinkly.  I guess it helps him be stretchy and agile so it makes sense.  It’s kind of unusual but these hairless kitties are still cute and I love them"
