The bike definitely triggered my motion sickness, but I think I'd get used to it. I'm fine in most games, but the floating feeling parts of games still get to me (and Ultrawings after a bit).

OculusQuest,ffao4f6,t3_esklk0,1579740519.0,"Love it. Crossbuy is a huge value-added feature and makes me so much more likely to pull the trigger.

Especially on games where there will be significant graphical upgrades for the PC version. Adds some decent replay value for when I build my computer later.

For games that *aren't* crossbuy, but also look much better on PC, I'm more inclined to just hold off and buy the PC version (for cheaper) later.

Obviously each dev needs to make their own choice, but I doubt I'm alone in that thinking."

I liked that death had consequences, but 10% (and losing levels) was a little heavy handed. I think 5 or 10% loss, *not* being able to lose levels, and needing to go get your gear would be a good middle ground.

People calling companies scummy because of this need to realize there are only two options. You either pay slightly more than you did a year ago, or get slightly less. Your money isn't as valuable as it was and that's not the company's fault.

It would be better if they didn't try to hide it, but we also shouldn't expect them to be advertising the size decrease.

oculus,feg1w2y,t1_feeznko,1579073341.0,"A good question, and one that I'm sure will be answered before this is in the hands of your average consumer.

My best guess is that you'd be able to set a max range for the glove, so you could have it stop before it gets uncomfortable. Or at least I hope, because my fingers can comfortably bend backwards 90° or more depending where you measure and which hand.

They also might have restrictive force be much greater than the ""push"" force. So when you're gripping down on something it can exert a lot of force to stop you, but if something is going to push your fingers backwards it wouldn't be as powerful as to not injure you."

oculus,feeuspk,t1_feesmrt,1579041673.0,"HaptX is like the Lamborghini of gloves; I don't think they have any direct competition for what they're producing yet.

Dexmo is ""much"" more basic (if you could even call this tech basic), but still adds the same practical functionality of HaptX gloves.

They have force feedback and touch haptics, but the haptics aren't as detailed as HaptX's glove.

Dexmo shines in its sleekness/weight and being wireless. It looks like it's near consumer ready, whereas HaptX has a long way to go still.

Seeing this video makes me think that part of the motivation for getting hand-tracking out in the wild was to start getting people thinking about how it could be used in games and apps early on. Once we've had this in our hands (not intended) for years the gloves would have a much easier time being adapted to by developers."
