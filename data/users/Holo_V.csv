It’s a great first RPG for kids that want to get into the genre and I’ve logged so many hours trying to 100% it. Unfortunately, my save data got lost when I changed systems when my DS broke so I lost all of that progress"

It was so fast and had a surprising amount of storage. I have had nothing but problems trying to deal with my new laptops. Google Docs is so much more reasonable to use than Microsoft Word. I’ve used google products ever since I was in Junior High and I hope to get a Stadia soon

SandersSides,fdejau5,t3_ek8vqf,1578340228.0,"I think that Virgil is (or at least was) Logan's dark side. When you look at Deceit and Remus, they stand for the exact opposite as their counter parts. Patton represents good choices and good things in the world, while Deceit is bad choices. Roman and Remus is self-explanatory. In my experience with anxiety, it defies all logic. Worrying about things that couldn't possibly be real and cognitive distortion (going back to the debate episode between Virgil and Logan). But I feel like even when Virgil was still a dark side, Logan always had a connection with him, even a bit of a soft spot for him. But that's just my two cents on that"
