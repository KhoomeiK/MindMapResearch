There's a black dude with this massive dong hiding in the closet or something, while the guy says something about how her vagina feels loser. Queue endless people saying that's not how vaginas work.

About a month or two ago, I was fooling around with a chick, and we decided to use some of the toys I have, including a very big dildo. She went at it, and it looked super hot, I was a happy man. Went on to have sex right after, and it was the losest vagina I've ever fucked.

As I said, it obviously doesn't just eternally stay like that, but to say vaginas are somehow immune to becoming loser is just as cringy as what the dude in the screenshot is saying.

Also, to all the people saying ""how exactly do people who think this think tampons and menstrual cups work?"", come on, stop being silly.

AlJazeera,femk0ip,t3_ep0c4v,1579259478.0,"Dane here. Came via ""other discussions"".

There's several major facets of this that the article leaves out, one of which is that immigrants and refugees (specifically from the middle east and Africa) cause more violent crime than the rest of the population combined, even though they only make up around 10% of the population.

Denmark is based on social cohesion. That everyone is ""in it together"", we're an incredibly homogenous society - which is the primary reason why we do so well in many areas. ""Everyone is in it together"". This is exactly why parallel society is a major problem for us, it fucks with the very foundation of what the country is built on.

The area they mention interviewing people, strangely they don't mention the cases of randomly assaulting old people or women, they don't mention the cop cars being vandalized, they don't mention that firefighters are lured there and then attacked.

The situation was different just 10 years ago, but at this point pretty much every single political party in Denmark agrees that we have serious issues with immigration not properly integrating into Danish society, one of the reasons being that they bunch together in groups of people that come from the same region or country. Most gangs and organized crime in Denmark is at this point also mostly immigrants or second generation immigrants - again, specifically from the Middle East and Africa. We don't have issues with people from the Philippines, Swedes, Americans, Japanese, the French, and so on. In fact, we can narrow it down to around 5 countries that account for the vast majority of immigrant crime in Denmark. 

We have data all the way back from 2002, that showed immigrants committing more crime - even when we factored in social services and age. For instance, men from Palestine commit more than twice the amount of crime than the rest of the male population (per capita, obviously).

We literally never had a drive by shooting until around 15 years ago - and again, immigrant gangs fighting over drugs.

These are also areas that cost the government huge amounts of money. People often forget that Denmark has this massive welfare system going, and when you have entire communities where living off social benefits is relatively normal, that's a problem.

Now, you might be thinking ""OK, but this sounds like a circular problem... immigrants arrive, don't feel part of the group, create their own group, Danes don't feel the immigrants integrate, shun them, new immigrants arrive, don't feel part of the group, etc. etc."". And you'd be right! That is largely the situation! 

Next up, you might think ""OK, but shouldn't the Danish government be the adult here then, and be the one opening up and easing up on them?"". Yes, we thought so too - which was largely how immigration was handled in the past. However, as second generation immigrants started growing up, it became apparent that our ""let's be nice, I'm sure they'll happily integrate into society themselves"" (Danes have a very ""when in Rome, do as the Romans"" attitude to visiting other countries) really didn't work. They weren't integrating well into society. It started coming out people had lived here for decades and still couldn't speak or read Danish. They didn't vote (around 80% of the Danish population votes). They commit considerably more crime.  And the list goes on.

In an effort to combat this, which we these days call ""parallel societies"" (since they often do not appear ""Danish"" in their culture), we have decided that areas with very many immigrants (50%+ - again, immigrants in total make up around 20% of the Danish population), AND low income, AND high crime, are areas we should demolish and rebuild, so as to essentially force people out into the rest of the society, where you are basically forced to integrate more."

""Og så vågner du bare med en dildo oppe i endetarmen"". Derudover, havde han/hun en tendens til at ændre i folks indlæg, og så derefter svare på noget som folk ikke havde skrevet.

Han/hun er så et par timer senere i den her tråd, hvor han/hun igen stiller spørgsmålstegn ved dommen.
