WinStupidPrizes,ffknc75,t1_ffj4ae6,1580025594.0,Came here to say the exact same thing.
AskReddit,ffkjrcu,t1_ffkbrj7,1580023918.0,"I agree with the research the company part. If you know who your interviewer, research that person just the same (LinkedIn). Ask the interviewer questions as to how and why they are working at the company, etc. For a weakness, give one that you know of yourself and an example on how you worked on it to improve. Example: bad at communicating-> took a communication course or simply started to learn how to ask for feedback."
iamverysmart,ffkijyz,t1_ffj6yr5,1580023342.0,Thank you. The way the math grad calculated hurt my head.
motorfietsen,fffdokz,t1_fff9oys,1579881679.0,"Nice. But I do also agree with others, do try track days I f you can. The Eifel forest is also a nice place to ride if you are somewhat experienced."
motorfietsen,fff6i2r,t3_et9ae0,1579876953.0,"If I where you I would avoid the A4 and A/N44. There are static cameras everywhere and a lot of controls. 
A2 towards ‘S-Hertogenbosch or A15 towards Arnhem are better. Autobahn is safer. With that being said, 215 - 220, it is the max my bike can go."

Your empathy, compassion is needed. 
Thank you for your story and I hope it reaches others."

Good day to you, kind passerby:)"

MurderedByWords,ffchmzh,t1_ffcgjfr,1579799656.0,"I don’t think she blindly follows, but purposely miss leads. Most people that follow her will take her word, since she is /was a judge. She knows what she is doing."
AskReddit,ffcgvoh,t1_ffbxtb4,1579799190.0,This is awesome. Glad to see you come stronger out the other side.

cats,ffbtpq5,t1_ff9rqnk,1579782396.0,"Next time ask the vet. A tech might have some knowledge, but they don’t have the background to answer your question. 
It’s like asking a nurse about a surgery instead of the surgeon."

motorcycles,ff4aa6p,t1_ff40wy1,1579558965.0,I still don’t get why you worry so much. Buy a Harley Davidson mesh jacket got the hot summer days and the leather version for the winter.
motorcycles,ff49st8,t1_ff3vn9e,1579558659.0,"That’s the spirit. 
May I be so bold as to suggest black Speedos?"
