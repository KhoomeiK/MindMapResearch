AskReddit,ffgi7hm,t3_etcyd6,1579906810.0,Honest answer: COMPLETELY disentangle the scientific fact of being a man with toxic masculinity. Reinvent the damn wheel. Tear down the patriarchal order that tells men they need to behave a certain way.
worldnews,ffcn5ub,t1_ffce8mw,1579803004.0,"Yeah, dumb third world China and their lack of regulation. You do realise that 60,000 people died of flu last year in America. A preventable disease."
worldnews,ffcmlwp,t1_ffbvysa,1579802667.0,"Lol, you post this from the USA: the country of genocide, perpetual war, and every kind of racism imaginable. The cognitive dissonance is palpable.

China is a country of 1bn, they consume, per capita, eons less than the USA who have virtually single handedly destroyed the world's climate. Yet an outbreak on a virus in a community who don't use fridges, in a country of 1bn somehow writes them off. You're grossly uneducated."
worldnews,ffcmdyc,t1_ffc14t0,1579802529.0,"Because maybe they taste nice? If it tastes nice, I honestly don't care. I'll kill it and eat it."
worldnews,ffcm8aa,t1_ffbvf62,1579802434.0,Exactly the attitude of America when they're eating fresh meat because they literally don't have fridges. This is so quickly going to become a nationalist issue I can just sense it.
instant_regret,ffbk502,t3_esm1my,1579769137.0,If this was intentional then it's super illegal. A guy in my city got arrested for it after a video went viral.

AskReddit,fdr83jm,t1_fdqepen,1578680749.0,"Hmm ""Carhartt WIP"" in Europe is like a high fashion brand. We wear carhartt canvas coats and jackets that cost £250+, but the quality is worse.

Having bought old US made Carhartt and seen tons of Carhartt in the states, the difference is there for sure. So yeah, ""Carhartt WIP"" is like a high end hipster brand over here in EU. A girlfriend bought me a jacket once and it was total garbage. Same for a T-shirt. It can't be the same production line as Carhartt workwear. Me personally, I go for Dickies now. I love Dickies. Same aesthetic but sturdier and cheaper."
AskReddit,fdr75vk,t3_emqd57,1578680426.0,"Running theme of this thread seems to be: if it involves machining of parts or engineering (and doesn't rely on fashion/aesthetic/hype) then they will probably want to uphold their reputation and provide great service. In these industries, unlike other more nonsense-filled ones, if you make shit products you go out of business in seconds flat. People that work with tools for a living don't need flash or looks, they need a product that does its job. 

In future, I'm only buying work equipment. For everything. I'll wipe my ass with sandpaper if I have to."
todayilearned,fdpvzsa,t3_eml35m,1578642795.0,"We should stop the insist teaching of English in the third world. Their own language/culture is enough; they don't need the language or capitalism. It enforces West-centric top-down, racist power structures."
news,fdpvrs7,t1_fdo3afs,1578642527.0,"Why nitpick over nationality? We all live on the same rock. Human beings died, and that's sad enough."
lostgeneration,fdjohqg,t3_elhain,1578480898.0,"Free markets aren't free at all; they're rigidly enforced with violence (through the police), participation is compulsory (don't participate in the health market, you die), and you can't do anything outside the market (like travel to Canada and stock up on insulin for you and your friends and undercut the competition), you also can't become a capitalist in that market by synthesising your own insulin. This is also illegal.

The biggest con of them all is that a free market is free. It is the least free thing in the known universe. It is a system of absolute control and exploitation."
news,fdhj0t9,t1_fdgcl55,1578423674.0,"If the UK had wildfires, best believe this would be more like 2.5million people arrested."
todayilearned,fcmy2c6,t1_fclv8fp,1577797207.0,"Which speaks to the core theme underpinning the lie central to the capitalist system: the stardom and fame poured on the heads of those that succeed, and the fact that this glosses over the vast majority who don't make it. A huge amount of ""luck *and* hard work"" is conflated solely with ""hard work"", meaning that the entrepreneurial mindset is largely mythical. 

I have recently had to do a great deal of research into entrepreneurs for my job as a research assistant at a large marketing company. 99% of the young entrepreneurial people I researched came from money and could find seed money very easily through parents/parents friends. Many could afford to fail multiple times due to their financial cushion.

The reality is that in many ways these people were either very rich to start with (which explains the article) or very, very lucky. The fact is though, that with our belief in societal tropes like David and Goliath, *hustling hard*, against all odds, etc. we structure our society around assuming we have a chance, which itself breeds loyalty with people who are, in reality, totally fucked by the system."
Iamactuallyverybadass,fcldp1e,t1_fcla700,1577745412.0,The only thing I know about him is he killed a man who was trying to kill others. Pinning him with any early integrity before the fact seems a projection of some preconceived notions than it does a reasonable assesment at this early stage.

todayilearned,fcelj49,t1_fccd5vw,1577621590.0,"Let's not forget ""crime"" and ""corruption"" don't spring out of nowhere. The US government has a lot to answer for in that respect, i.e. how they orchestrated a coup and installed a violent, corrupt dictator."
