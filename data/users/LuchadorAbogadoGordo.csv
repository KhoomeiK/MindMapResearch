gundeals,ffe6cm7,t1_ffdz8vc,1579837879.0,I just had my first two transactions with them and thankfully they've been better than their reputation suggested.   Ordered an upper and brace/lpk on the 17th and it shipped the 20th.  Then last night I ordered the Romeo 5 plus 10 D&H mags and they had shipped this morning.
gundeals,ff858f8,t1_ff7hljf,1579666335.0,"Well shit.  I ordered an upper and brace this weekend with my business card cuz, you know, wives don't see business expenses.   

They did include some weird Norton protection thing."
politics,ff0bgfh,t1_fetbldl,1579467226.0,"Am trial lawyer.   Mostly criminal defense.   You can't ethically take a position opposed to your client.*  You can argue different positions and views of the law in different scenarios.   It's within bounds to argue the law one way to one court (this conduct constitutes this offense) and then argue another way (this conduct does not) so long as there is a good faith basis in the law for both.  It's misrepresenting law or arguing something without some basis that you cause trouble.  With impeachment being a wide open ultra rarely litigated field it's not like there are established principles.   Plus there's no real rules or oversight because, well, Republicans exist.  

Basically, no ethical or legal problems, just stupidity and evil.  

* You can, with client permission, admit things in the criminal context for various advantages even as far as establishing credibility with a jury (e.g. yes my client did X but he didn't do Y so not guilty or guilty of lesser offense or guilty but not as bad).  You also have ethical rules that cover perpetrating a fraud or other crimes with your services."
gundeals,feyqs29,t1_fey74br,1579449363.0,"Just ordered the pieces to build an AR pistol.   Then sgammo had a good deal on Barnaul produced Wolf.   Plus I def need a Romeo 5 for the new pistol.   

Maybe if I just let them repossess my daily driver I can just use my offroader to commute and clear up a few hundo a month for fun stuff.   That's a normal thing to think, right?"
gundeals,fej0g19,t1_feixhsh,1579152506.0,I am open.   I'm reading that 11.3 or better is ideal but that 10.5 is not significantly inferior.
gundeals,feiv7k8,t3_ep5wnn,1579148106.0,"This or the PSA 10.5"" CHF with three BCG and CH for $449?"
gundeals,fe42hlm,t1_fdzpigs,1578855103.0,Other than clarity how does the Romeo 5 stack up against the Holosun?  I'm on the edge of buying the gen 2 Stribog and brace for it.   I'd love to have an optic day one but if I do that now it's gonna get me pretty close to a grand.  The Romeo is cheaper but I wonder if I need to buy once cry once.
gundeals,fdjzvnq,t1_fdhjhz9,1578492519.0,"I own both.   I started with a P07 and was immediately floored at how good a pistol in this price range could be.  I ended up getting the P09 as well after that.   I carry the 7 and the 9 is my home defense gun with a light on it.   Both are a pleasure to shoot but the extra barrel and weight on the 9 just highlights how great this system is.   Great triggers, not snappy, never a hiccup after thousands of rounds of crap ammo, and accurate well beyond what I'm capable of.   

To choose between them just decide what your intended use is.   Both excel at their intended roles"
pics,fctafg8,t1_fcsxn4o,1577937243.0,"So I spent about $300 for the one I made for Thanksgiving.   The meats were prosciutto, chorizo iberico, salchichon iberico, saucisson sec, soppresata, and a Canadian elk sausage.   Cheeses were a French triple cream, a boursin buche, brie wheel, manchego, and brillat savarin with dried papaya.   Olives (3 types), bread, crackers.   Orange ginger marmalade and stone ground mustard.

Most of that was quality stuff special ordered and most fit on a 16""x20"" board.   She's got a LOT more than I had but a lot appears to be grocery store stuff (not judging at all, it's all delicious, I just like to go hard when I've got a house full of people).   I'd guess $500-600 because of volume and there are several folded meats jn the center that I can't see.   

For reference we had 27 people total for Thanksgiving, 5 of which were children.   Most of it was gone by the end of the day.  I bet she could pre-meal over 100 or heavy hors d'oeuvres 50 for a long night of shenanigans.   

Fuggin' bravo lady."
todayilearned,fcghtoi,t1_fcggxq8,1577640214.0,That's a great suggestion.   I'll keep that in mind.   Thank you.

Showerthoughts,fcfysvt,t1_fcfiv7r,1577634957.0,I'm a very pro-2A person and personally own a lot of the firearms that are constantly the topic of proposed legislation/bans.  I say that as a preface so that I don't come off as having an axe to grind on this issue.   Oath Keepers is a terrifying right wing insurgent group who wanted to start a fight with the government over Kim Davis.  In a vacuum of power these guys would be the next American Taliban.  They are the military wing of Fox News much like IIIers and other tough guy militia types.   The idea that they're serious about individual liberties other than an expansive reading of the 2A is absurd.
todayilearned,fcdlfrl,t1_fcc5kxo,1577611093.0,I recently had a case where a Guatemalan immigrant child was the victim of abuse.   The situation was extra difficult because mom spoke K'iche with a tiny bit of Spanish.   Dad spoke Spanish and a little K'iche and English.   Child spoke a little of all three.  It occurred in a rural county in a rural state.   Getting interpreters was tough.
worldnews,fc7nmnu,t1_fc73dxl,1577513510.0,"This why you get a recorded proffer, statement under oath, or affidavit from a witness seeking immunity.   You wanna get cute and confess to aggravated murder?  Cool, we'll either impeach you with your prior statements and charge you with perjury for the false testimony (either current or former) or just charge you with the offense you've just admitted to.   

Not sure how this simple, literally everyday, task of flipping a witness was mishandled but good Lord."
news,fc6dqhc,t1_fc6a6vb,1577478158.0,"If you're a small state that's unpopular in your region and reliant on continued foreign support and arms sales it's probably helpful to ensure that support and those sales continue.   If there were growing movements in supporting states questioning whether their continued support was beneficial it would be important to have a variety of disincentives to discontinuing aid and sales.   Kompromat on critical decision makers could be a valuable tool if other pressure points have failed.   

I'm 100% not saying that this is happening.   There's no publicly available evidence that it is.  But having information gathering at the upper echelons of your current allies' decisionmaking circles is always valuable."
todayilearned,fc6cn9l,t1_fc5j9gs,1577477445.0,"My daily is a Focus ST and my toy is a 3rd Gen 4runner.   The 4runner has 234k miles on it and is actually made for offroad usage.  The Jeep brodozer types put on $2,500.00 in wheels and tires then go mall crawling and never accept the invites to go offroading.   Hell most wouldn't know how to use a winch even if they had one.   And that would be fine because there's a bunch of stupid machismo in the hobby where people think they're badass because they can order truck parts and they've got a tall ride.   They never consider that offroading requires zero toughness.   The problem is that not only do many of them have that crappy identity but then have never driven through a puddle.   Like dude, go but a Kia Sorento.   It's half the price, more reliable, more comfortable, gets better gas mileage, and I promise your penis won't shrink."
news,fc5jzvt,t1_fc50uuo,1577459671.0,"I'm glad you pointed this out because it's something that's discussed a lot in my job.  I do a lot of capital defense and, along with total abolition, we are pushing hard for exclusion of young adults age 18-21 from the death penalty.   The brain science shows that critical areas are developing until age 25.  Society recognizes that there are lower levels of responsibility for individuals in that range by virtue of age alone.   This change will be added to the litigation resources already in place."
