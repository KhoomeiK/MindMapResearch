Cooking,ff9fcyb,t3_es3e31,1579711819.0,My parents just moved out of their home of 15 years. One of the last meals mom and I made together was at ten pm at night and we drank coffee and wine while we made eggs together. It's so so strange for that place to not be part of my life. I did send her this.
writing,ff9dpvr,t1_ff8rh0w,1579710774.0,Yeah that's what I ended up doing. It didn't impact the story flow over all. Thank you!
writing,ff9dm4j,t1_ff8zjui,1579710704.0,The section is a setting intro for the anthology I personally will write at a future date. It doesn't impact the flow of the overall story to remove that for the submission.
migraine,ff6k46d,t1_ff5suah,1579628905.0,Oh god. I had a candle lit the other day... That lasted 5 minutes.
WhatShouldICook,ff40jn4,t3_ereqol,1579552903.0,"I agree freezing most of it! If it's not ground get some ground. A pumpkin/butternut squash and apple stew might be amazing with venison. Handpies/pasties are fun to make and eat with any kind of stewable meat. 

Did homemade venison helper with my last batch of ground. Hubby's mom covers it bbq sauce and cooks it for like 30 minutes and you just eat it on toast or a bun."
migraine,ff2btmm,t3_er6mpr,1579500002.0,The study didn't say but good question.
migraine,ff2bs4p,t1_ff1xfhi,1579499961.0,I did. It's cool but expensive
WhatShouldICook,fevwc1x,t1_fevrmn5,1579402253.0,I understand your concern but I'd need clearer sources than just don't. We spent a couple hours reading up on it and found lots of info suggesting that since they were frozen solid the entire time at minimum the claws and legs should be fine.
WhatShouldICook,fetjpfp,t1_fetihe5,1579376107.0,Nice!
WhatShouldICook,feti64w,t1_fetfp0w,1579375667.0,"My husband went on a southern coastal fishing trip with his brother. They were supposed to catch fish, butcher them and bring me fillets back. Instead I got a cooler of crabs and a hubby with a very bad cold. He's not in trouble but he is the taste tester for today's crab."
WhatShouldICook,fet9sn0,t1_fet8nza,1579373086.0,Yeah. It's because of a bacteria in their gut that's toxic to humans I think. There were 4 of us researching it last night but I was very very ill at that point. Frozen then cooked seems to be safe if slightly less delicious
WhatShouldICook,fesnis2,t1_fer74f7,1579367120.0,If that's beer it makes good bread.
WhatShouldICook,fesn7p9,t1_fer4yqe,1579367023.0,You lost me at vinegar but hubby might try it.
WhatShouldICook,fesmvxr,t1_fer71ba,1579366924.0,Went into the ice alive and stayed frozen in ice until last night when they were cleaned and chucked into a pot.
Cooking,fesm7fl,t1_ferbwas,1579366704.0,That would be about thr sound I made when I stabbed myself with a crab last night.
WhatShouldICook,feslwc7,t1_fes87j2,1579366609.0,Will do! Anything that involves Italian food is high on my to cook list.
WhatShouldICook,fesllub,t1_fesbsd6,1579366509.0,I would eat that! But I'm the only one who would.

WhatShouldICook,feqj40a,t1_feqgfs5,1579342503.0,Ok anything spicy goes over well in this house!
Cooking,feqiz0f,t1_feqevbq,1579342443.0,"We aren't sure about eating the body meat. While they've been on ice the whole time the oldest was caught six days ago and we have no way to tell the old from the new, nor when they died. Reading up suggested that eating the body meat might be toxic so..."
Catswithjobs,feq6ed3,t3_eqe60m,1579338165.0,In relation to [r/What should I cook? I have 38 crabs](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldICook/comments/eqbfd4/i_have_38_frozen_blue_crabs_what_should_i_cook/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Cooking,fepv1bi,t1_fepuxhf,1579332307.0,Same! We lake fished when I was young. There is nothing like a walleye you caught two hours ago. Yum!

Cooking,feps0dp,t1_fepr4km,1579329296.0,My fiance does spiced (cumin salt and pepper I think) buttered caramelized onions. For beer brauts. They are to die for. I usually do the cooking but what my spouses cook they do perfectly.
WhatShouldICook,fepror7,t1_feprar2,1579328991.0,Om nom! I love cajun.
WhatShouldICook,feprm0z,t3_eqbfd4,1579328921.0,"Update: Hi all my ill self has had to retire but the crabs are being slightly defrosted to see which ones are still alive. The live ones are going into a nice pot of salt water. The rest of the fam is going to pop the legs off the dead ones and we'll freeze those. I'm totally baking some tomorrow to eat with corn bread.

Update 2: Bitty the Cat has discovered the crabs. She stopped before we could get a picture.

Update 3: 8 Crabs left and Bitty came back. [to inspect the crabs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Catswithjobs/comments/eqe60m/the_crab_inspector/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Update 4: All the crabs are cooked and in the deep freezer. We're unsure if we will eat the body meat because they were all dead. I'm a little limited on supplies but I will look over recipes tomorrow. You all were AMAZING! Thank you so so much!"
Cooking,fepqqqa,t1_fepqgiq,1579328119.0,I've been thinking about that for tomorrow! We have onions on hand and it's supposed to be cold.

migraine,fef43ya,t1_feek2u4,1579047716.0,Oh no. I'm sorry you're hurting. My hubby is the same chronic pain plus mobility and balance issues. He's the loud one in the house too. I love him but I'm so happy he's half a continent away during this long spell.
Dolls,fedrlq3,t3_eojyit,1579018390.0,He is amazing! I'd love to see more pics!
migraine,fedqxtb,t1_fedeuac,1579017975.0,">Well... They kinda die if you don't,

Excuse me while I gigglesnort. I mean to be fair migraines and other illnesses are a contributing factor in why we didn't have kids. 

One of my biggest migraine symptoms is body weakness sadly. I can stand up for roughly ten minutes every couple hours when I'm in fullblown headache mode."
migraine,fecjqk6,t3_eo7u84,1578975590.0,"My real advice here is get a soft floppy knit hat with a little brim. I loved mine and need a new one something feirce it made such a difference with light sensitivity too.

I have a story about this though! I also have short hair after years of keeping it long. I wanted to cut because brushing was a nightmare. My hubby though it would look terrible if I cut it short. He begged me not to cut it. 

A stylist friend of ours cut it for me into a curly stacked bob. I came home and he said I'd never looked sexier!"
migraine,fecii8n,t1_fecdum2,1578974738.0,Feel this! Also migraine writers! I'm trying to put together enough of my brain to finish the last scene of my WIP and start editing. Kudos to you for keeping up with the kids! I honestly have no idea how moms do it.
migraine,feact7j,t1_feaa1ej,1578947114.0,"No insult taken! Grats on finding something that helped. You're not alone in having a moment where you question your sanity. migraines were maybe twice a month until my new doctor decided to put me on horomonal birth control for low iron. Called to double check if they really wanted me to take something that had a huge anti migraine warning label. 

I took it for 3 weeks and had a migraine the whole time. And my migraines got worse even after I stopped. So bad I can't go out for more than a couple hours at a time. There's no medical reason the birth control should have screwed me up long term but I swear it did."
BJD,fea7fj4,t1_fea7929,1578945240.0,Yup he's from '08.
migraine,fe98w6k,t3_eo4lib,1578935463.0,Oh! I have some green light bulbs! OP have you tried a night filter on your phone? Might also help.
migraine,fe96gz0,t3_eo56p5,1578934802.0,"So glad it works for you that's awesome! It does not, however work for everyone. I just have a neat piercing now. Good luck with your botox!"
migraine,fe7daf9,t1_fe7cqeq,1578912990.0,Aww! They sound so sweet. ^.^
migraine,fe7b9x9,t1_fe7a105,1578912416.0,I did fail sadly but I have a second shot at it! And oh my gosh you are strong to handle the little ones. My cat purrs at me on a bad day and I escort him out!
