BodyDysmorphia,ffbu3yq,t3_esj4op,1579782793.0,"Yes. As much as I want to be more social, have more friends or even have a boyfriend, my body and face is just so horrible. Why would someone waste their time with me when they can talk to or be in a relationship with someone more beautiful. I'm legitimately scared of meeting new people, I wear face masks in public all the time."
