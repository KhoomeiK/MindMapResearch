LeopardsAteMyFace,ff1jbmt,t1_ff10842,1579480114.0,"I think it is sort of a half-leopard/face scenario. what H&M have done is taken from the tabloids anything to write about after the tabloids doubled down on trying to rip them apart. What the papers did was demand the royals do XYZ, but didnt really want them to, because if they did, they would have nothing to write about. H%M in turn agreed to everything the papers demanded, and walked away. The papers got what they asked for, and now have one less sure fire targets to sell papers with. And regrets are had."

canada,felhrmk,t1_fel1c11,1579222475.0,"This 100%.

canada,felh165,t1_fela0f0,1579221977.0,"Its not a straight up lie, but more of a case of cherry-picking comments from a large pool to hopefully trigger opposition. Sort of Fox News' mirror image."

LeopardsAteMyFace,fdiw463,t3_elja1m,1578452372.0,China only trades with the US because American's want to buy what they are selling.

You represent your school, country, gym, whatever, and your results reflect on everyone who is competing for the same entity, and you usually train together.

canada,fdhnqqa,t1_fdhmmvb,1578426531.0,"In my experience it is often a case in team sports of ""hardcore"" kids/parents vs. casual kids/parents. One wants their kids to live the life, fight hard for every goal, push their limits to breaking, etc. The other wants their kid to have fun, make some friends, learn to work as a team, etc. When the hardcore parents/kids see the casual kids, they get angry about being ""dragged down"" or not living up to expectations. Or, in some simpler cases, it is a basic case of jocks vs nerds. Some less-than-total-jock kid joins the team and gets labeled as a nerd, weak or whatever. Problem is you don't know which are the ""serious"" teams and which are the ""fun"" teams until you are in there."

cats,fdgzwxj,t1_fdgw8b6,1578412331.0,"I had a dog years ago that had a stroke, and that was very similar to what you describe. Movement difficulty and drooling are both signs you would expect to see.

canada,fdeyj4o,t1_fdenha4,1578349320.0,Agreed. All systems have problems and detractors. One system that I have found interesting is the multi-tiered system where everyone gets free care to a point and beyond that it requires private payment. Another is where you offer access based on things like risk factor rather than just treating everyone as a generic patient. Lots of different options.
canada,fdexztn,t1_fdeheqa,1578348989.0,"I think the main thing is to say ""there are problems, let's make what we have better"" rather than ""there are problems, let's dump the system and privatize everything"".

It was a bad decision on his part to complain so publicly over something like that, but firing as opposed to a reprimand seems really heavy handed. And yeah, not everyone gets something from their employer at XMAS, but when you do, and you get something substantially less than other employees because of location, that is definitely a slap and the company knows that."

If the doctor was seeing this guy outside of a hospital, he may well have not been entering his records since it is not required.

canada,fcz0avw,t1_fcxv2np,1578091052.0,"Perhaps better to say they don't understand real estate markets. As a former realtor, I can tell you that every month has a unique sales profile. December is by far the worst month to sell because of a general lack of buys due to focus on the holidays (May is the best to sell in most markets). So comparing December to December is much more relevant than November to December of the same year. It is also significant since December, as the lowest selling month to begin with) does not usually have a lot of fluctuation, so an increase of that size is major. It not only indicates the past reduction in market prices, but is a strong predictor of continued decrease in prices in the coming year. So as the OP and Seebeeeseh say, it is a big deal and newsworthy."
