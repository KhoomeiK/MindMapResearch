bipolar,fdr5rie,t3_emp7i3,1578679815.0,"I ended up having to tell my grandmother about my diagnosis a little bit ago, and over the holidays as our whole family is playing cards she says (loudly), “Are you sure about your bipolar? Maybe you need a second opinion”. Now she’s the only one I’ve told in this side of my family about my diagnosis. So she’s not only outed me in front of my whole family but questioned the validity of what I’ve gone through in the process. All because I just “seemed too normal”."
bipolar,fdd5f73,t3_ekdkm2,1578295580.0,"Dude pardon my language, but this is cool as fuck! Keep on doing what you’re doing because you’re doing it right. You could legit sell these if you wanted."

That’s what I’ve done and I post what I want there with only people I trust won’t out me to those I don’t want to know. It hasn’t backfired on me yet! Whatever you end up doing, I hope it works in your favor!"
NonBinary,fc7ntal,t3_eglsef,1577513712.0,"Dude I love your piercing set up, it’s cool as hell! Also that’s a very cute bird, I have a green cheek Conure and she’s evil, but I love her anyways."

bipolar,fc4vs4o,t3_eg7wlx,1577430431.0,"This was done after a stressful day in which an overbearing relative managed to both out me as bipolar to my entire extended family and question my diagnosis in the process (she has no idea what the disorder even entails). Went home and drew this. Disclaimer, the art I do usually has the purpose to make others laugh, so I hope it works on you!"
mentalillness,fc190ez,t3_efl7tv,1577311714.0,"I’m so sorry that the holidays ended up like this for you and that your family treats you like this. You definitely have a valid reason to want to go to a mental health profesional. Mental illness in your family does indeed put you at more risk of developing a disorder yourself. Your family should not be treating you the way they have. I promise you’re not being overly dramatic (my family used to tell me the same), I’d recommend asking them if you could visit a therapist or psychiatrist if you think they’d be willing to consider. I know it can be hard to ask, and if they say no, maybe ask other relatives that would be more likely to listen. I hope you can find a solution or something that can help ease the stress. I’m always here if you need to talk"
bipolar,fbnenpx,t1_fblv538,1576996581.0,"It’s been great so far! I’m glad to see that someone else is following this treatment as well, because I hadn’t heard of it previously. I think it’s  a lot more fast acting than the lamotrigine, and taking such a small dose avoids the negative side effects and need for blood testing. My psychiatrist told me that I could start taking it and then taper off of it once I’m feeling more stable, but for now I think I’m going to stick with it. Also I’ll look into SAD lights, because that’d be really nice right around now :,)"
