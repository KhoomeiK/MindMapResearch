I haven't really been paying attention to lore developments since 3rd or 4th edition, so feel free to correct me.

All soldiers get bored, that is practically all they do. Soldiering is a heck of a lot of ""hurry up and wait"" with the occasional interruption of blood, gore and violence, and I would say terror if it wasn't space marines that was the subject.

I recall that the adeptus astartes are among the most psycopathicly violent individuals of the human species, even before they are made superhuman, and they are kept in check only by psychotherapy and a hellishly strict program of daily rituals and routines that impose discipline.

So I do think that they get bored, but it is the quiet  boredom we all feel when we go through the motions of ritualised routine.

dresdenfiles,fedaysw,t1_fed9pr1,1579006148.0,"True. She does seem to focus on the life saving part of necromancy. Could it be that Cowl keeps her around as an insurance policy?

A little weak, but it's an idea?

Her motivation could be something as simple as Cowl is the person that took care of her and acknowledged her, cliché as it is. Though, she doesn't know the full extend of what Cowl is involved in and when she finds out, she gets second thoughts on the whole thing and then tries to get help from the friendly neighbourhood wizard that helped her when she was lost once before and BLAM!

dresdenfiles,fed48hw,t1_fed3sxa,1578998044.0,"Though you are correct, I would say that the one in the receiving end of a spell doesn't really care if it is skill or power and in this particular case, I call it semantics, because what I wanted to point out is that, if Faith is Kumori, she performs magical feats I wouldn't expect from a 15 year old.

She was, so it doesn't lie beyond possibility that Faith first manifested her powers at the age of 11. Nothing, as of yet, states that Dresdens case is special.

Again, I'm not arguing against you that the idea of Faith being Kumori borders on the ridiculous of absolute ridiculously ridiculousness, but I don't think anything short of Butcher himself can turn me away from the idea."
dresdenfiles,fe80j94,t1_fe7vzgg,1578921022.0,"Power, skill. Semantics.

Dresdens magic manifested at the age of ten, so Faiths magic could have manifested not long after Restoration of Faith.

I'm not arguing against you, I think the whole idea is more than a little unlikely, not to say downright next to impossible, but I can't get over it.

The way it clicks with me is on a level beyond the explanation with words."
dresdenfiles,fe7tr1b,t1_fe7snkl,1578919142.0,"I know. According to the timeline, Faith would be about 15 years old in dead beat and that is why I said that she would have to be exceptionally powerful for her age. That was meant as a counter argument against my own idea."
ShittyLifeProTips,fe3fxc5,t1_fe2imxs,1578848916.0,"The ""free"" part of it is debatable. It is all paid through taxes. Of my wage, the government first takes an 8% ""workforce contribution"". After that they take 37% in sheer tax. On top of that, everytime I buy anything, and that is anything at all, 25% of what I pay goes straight down the state coffers. 

If I want to buy a car, I have to pay something that looks like about 200%, if not slightly more, of the actual price of the car and don't forget about that 25%.

I'm not complaining about it, it is just that it has a price.

It is wonderful that we can go to the doctor or the hospital without taking out a loan, but the downside is that we have a lot of waiting time and because our hospitals are solely dependent on state funds, they are extremely vulnerable to budget cuts in the health sector, which is one of the first sectors to get massive cuts, and so hospitals is understaffed and both nurses and doctors are overworked and they simply don't have time to take proper care of their patients."

We know that Faith will be the Femme Fatale that sets off the BAT and it would be quite the tie in with getting directly in the face of Cowl, who we know hangs out with outsiders and is definitely involved with whatever is going to happen.
