syriancivilwar,ffdc0qb,t1_ffa5tjn,1579817658.0,Yeah because most of us become naturally Hellenised after the conquest of Alexander then willfully but slowly converted to Islam and adopted Turkish language.

I have numerous other occasions of losing saves due to trusting autosave. First of all some games only allow 1 autosave. If your only save is an autosave then good luck if your save file ever becomes corrupt again.

Fallout,ff1tonh,t1_ff1t73f,1579485946.0,They do not criticise implementation. They mostly don't like being given Power Armor so early on but this is a different game. There is no rule like you can't stumble upon something so valuable in the wasteland by pure chance so it's not an issue for me. But they are far too ubiquitous in F4.

Youtube also does this. That shit is not even 720p. Just open a dvd movie and compare it to Netflix's and YouTube's 1080p. Your dvd's quality will be better.

TLDR: Quality settings like 720p, 1080p or 4k in YouTube and Netflix are not real 720p, 1080p or 4k. Bandwidth and server allocation cost money and
 they try to get away with lowest quality and using these as marketing.
