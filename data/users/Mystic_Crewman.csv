Not just in video games. But in media. I'm fine with him having said it, just because he said something about video games too, it doesn't make Joe Biden a more acceptable candidate. Joe is woefully out of touch with young voters, and the OPs post pointed towards further evidence. Bernie is much more in touch, even if he is using conjecture here that most research disproves. It's easy to make that connection emotionally, and logically, even if the science doesn't back it up. Bernie can be wrong here, but it doesn't change the fact that he is still more in touch than Joe with young voters."

atheism,fds1wbf,t3_emt03o,1578693043.0,"I went to a Christian high school. Went to a Christian college where I got a bachelor's in Youth Ministry and Bible, then went on to get a Master's degree in spiritual formation. I have always hated going to church. I wanted to make my parents proud though and nothing would make them more proud than having a Pastor in the family. I had always wanted to be a doctor, but honestly, probably couldn't have afforded that. Anyway, long story short: Going to Christian college for pastoral shit really let's you see how much of the ""God and church experience"" is manufactured and I just couldn't put up with it anymore. Only my wife knows of my deconversion (she has deconverted as well) and none of our family knows. So to answer your actual question, yeah, a lot of people I know who went to Christian School deconverted. But I think it's more to do with the era we live in now than Christian School itself. Socially we've evolved past the need for religion."
