Disordered eating is a much broader term for a variety of poor eating habits and includes constant overeating,  emotional eating, binging, etc. which FAs conveniently leave out of their eating disorder rhetoric."

A lot of the rhetoric you hear revolves around classifying foods or people as healthy/unhealthy, as if it's some absolute state of being to be healthy or unhealthy. In reality health is a spectrum.
