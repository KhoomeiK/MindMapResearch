raisedbyborderlines,ffcomkr,t3_eserr0,1579803912.0,"Thank you for making this post, this is incredibly insightful. I also over-exaggerate my facial expressions and I also feel compelled to show people physically or reiterate to people when I‚Äôm sick. I never thought about it, but it makes sense that I‚Äôd pick up these strategies as a way to get attention and love from my mom. 

Like your pwBPD, my uBPD mom is unable to read facial expressions or body language. She‚Äôll say wildly inappropriate things to strangers, make them visibly uncomfortable, and then walk away from the interaction feeling like it went well. It‚Äôs baffling. 

Shortly before I went NC, my mom actually said something to me that proves she CAN read some nonverbal cues, at least to a degree. She pointed out that I‚Äôm always stiff and nervous when I hug her. She‚Äôs right, but I didn‚Äôt realize she could tell because she‚Äôd never said anything before. 
(Of course when she did finally say something, she was angry with me rather than concerned lol)"

I was in a very similar boat for a long time. My uBPD mom would also demand I come over weekly and put my life on pause to help her. I was basically ‚Äòon call‚Äô whenever she needed help with something or emotional support. 

I told my therapist that I felt obligated to take care my mom. She asked why. She asked if anyone was pointing a gun at me and making me. I said no, that I just had to take care of her because no else would. So she asked why no one else would. I said it was because she got in fights with everyone and scared everyone away so now she only had me. She asked why that was my problem and why that meant I had to throw my life away.

You don‚Äôt have to throw away your life to take care of your mom, especially if she doesn‚Äôt even appreciate it and continues to be abusive anyway. 

Your wants and your needs are just as valid as hers. You don‚Äôt need to put yourself on the back burner. You can focus your energy on yourself. You‚Äôre worth it."

‚ÄúThis usage of the phrase can be traced back to the seventeenth century and has been associated with various trades where quantities were measured by comparison to the width or length of a thumb.

Seeing a therapist is definitely a great first step. Maybe start off with something as simple as making some Pinterest boards that capture your interests.

One time my mom found a squished penny souvenir I got from Disneyland. She couldn't read what it said and she asked me where it was from. I lied and said it was my boyfriend's, and that he got it years ago on a family vacation. I don't know why I lied. I'm in my 20s, don't live with her, and I'm definitely allowed to go to Disneyland if I want. But it just felt like she couldn't know.

I struggle with these guilty feelings sometimes too, and sometimes I think 'wow, maybe I really was brainwashed by my dad and my mom really is the victim.' After all, WHY would she lie about all this? 

One thing my therapist told me that was helpful was that she doesn't think my mom is lying on purpose.

Like your mom, my mom has also come home from appointments blaming my dad, shouting 'My therapist says YOUR the problem!!' And like you, I also have my doubts that any therapist ever actually said this to her.

More recently, my mom has talked to a 'therapist' and to a 'team of scientists' about me, and they apparently tell her that I'm 'one of the worst cases of brainwashing they've ever seen.' I don't know if she's actually talking to anyone at all or if she's just completely making it up, but it's pretty obvious that she's not getting the real mental healthcare she needs.

Thanks for all your kind words, I hope you find peace and happiness as well."

When you‚Äôre taking care of yourself and protecting yourself, there‚Äôs no room for this kind of toxic behavior and these cycles of drama. You don‚Äôt need to live in her twisted version of reality just to make her feel okay. It‚Äôs not your job. And in the end it wouldn‚Äôt matter anyway, because even if you did bend over backwards for her, she‚Äôd still probably be miserable anyway. 

Her behavior is the result of an untreated personality disorder. You‚Äôre not doing anything wrong. 

I hope you have a truly incredible 2020! :)"

raisedbyborderlines,fco5std,t3_ehh198,1577824626.0,"Hi there! I‚Äôm so sorry that she‚Äôs putting you through this. She sounds really controlling and inappropriate and BPD. 

>growing up i felt she was very loving and always felt she was my protector, however as i grew older and began to become more and more independent, her BPD-symptoms became more and more obvious. 


This is the same for my mom as well. It‚Äôs made it harder for me to accept that she actually was abusive. I think about all the happy, loving memories from my childhood and just don‚Äôt understand what happened in my teenage years. 
They never wanted us to grow up and be independent from them. It‚Äôs despicable. That‚Äôs literally a parents job!

>this kind of gave me some anxiety because where do i even begin? the intense anger of her making emotional jabs at me? the way she treats me? the way she manipulates and lies to my face? not to mention the pain she‚Äôs caused my dad? the constant violation of boundaries i set regarding my dad? the way she constantly manipulated my own feelings into somehow attacking her instead of communicating what i‚Äôm going through?

I‚Äôve asked myself all these questions too. My uBPD completely blew up our family and then spent years blaming my dad for it. They‚Äôre incapable of self reflecting and taking accountability. Somethings just... wrong with them. I don‚Äôt understand how my mom and other pwBPD can have literally no self awareness, but they do. My therapist always tells me, ‚ÄúStay out of her head.‚Äù Because I‚Äôll never be able to understand her sick brain anyway. 

>my situation, has anyone had actual progress communicating and letting out their feelings with their BPD parent?

No. I went NC in July. I tried to say ‚Äòthe right thing‚Äô for years and it never worked. I‚Äôve begged and cried and pleaded with her to get help. I‚Äôve written thoughtful, precise emails to her with the help of my therapist. I‚Äôve yelled at her out of anger and frustration. I‚Äôve tried keeping her at an arms length and being low contact. I‚Äôve tried calling therapists and making appointments for her. I‚Äôve called the cops on her. Her friends, neighbors, and my dad have all encouraged her to get help. I have tried literally everything I can think of besides physically restraining her and dropping her off at a mental hospital. 

If they don‚Äôt want to change, there‚Äôs nothing you can do. 
I‚Äôm really sorry."
