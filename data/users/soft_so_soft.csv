PS4,ffr9hop,t1_ffr4fl0,1580153369.0,The good news is that cosmetics will be less of a priority to the developer and publisher in a game that gives them for free (like DOOM Eternal) than in a game where they assign market value to cosmetics.
todayilearned,ffr7rnz,t1_ffr4ew0,1580152300.0,"They all sounded rhetorical for the most part, as no answer would suffice to appropriately share my stance. I have been clear in my explanation and stated in my previous comments just how pedantic this conversation can become if you are set on defending something I am not inherently disagreeing with in the first place."
todayilearned,ffqsody,t1_ffq63vd,1580142742.0,"Entertainment is good and adults can do things meant for kids. I think that bothers some, but I am absolutely participating in both these categories on a weekly basis."
todayilearned,ffpq8m3,t1_ffpoqzj,1580101924.0,"Organized sports are based around kids games, and are for entertainment. They serve no other needed purpose. All the other points being made validate that it is entertainment and provides that resource to adults. Entertainment is a crowded arena and adults have plenty of options of how to entertain themselves. This does not stop sports from being categorized as kids games. We could say sports are primarily for health, and it would still be a kids game used for physical improvement. We could also divide sports up and have a more honest conversation about the fact that that is a big blanket word for many activities that adults and kids both participate in. None of this prevents my assertion that sports are kids games that adults also play ( like all things for kids). Also, art serves a purpose without having to bend logic to serve the point."
todayilearned,ffpis37,t1_ffpi4z2,1580096043.0,The majority of all sports are played by kids. The majority of cartoons are watched by kids. I play sports and watch cartoons and am an adult. The idea that something for kids can be something adults do too is where I think the negativity is coming from. Those who think they disagree with me have yet to make any valid point that detracts from my statement without misinterpreting the obvious statement.
todayilearned,ffp6sm4,t1_ffp6kyr,1580087670.0,"We made the same points, lol"
todayilearned,ffp64kx,t1_ffp5jfi,1580087200.0,Correct.
todayilearned,ffp59kd,t1_ffp4tin,1580086533.0,"I am not wrong and am not being dismissive. Sports are entertainment for adults. Playing them is most benefitial to children and is at most a hobby for adults who typically PLAY, like board games or hiking. This is not to say that board games are just for kids either."
todayilearned,ffp36qc,t1_ffp2rik,1580085346.0,"Adults who entertain by playing sports are not children for playing a game. They are entertaining by playing. If there were no audience, they would be enjoying a pasttime from their childhood. Adults can play a kids game..."
todayilearned,ffp12um,t1_ffoxxc7,1580084146.0,"Basketball is a kids game...all sports are kids games as they are useless outside of entertainment and serve no purpose for adults. Sports build on ideals like teamwork and strategy so that when kids grow up and become adults, they apply these uselful tools to actual life. I also don't think there is anything wrong with liking sports as an adult, just like how Marvel movies are watched by all ages."
TrueFilm,ffnnrcx,t1_ffkpbku,1580068268.0,"Some parents want their kids raised in a box. Society will raise kids whether  adults want it to or not. Being  involved in the consumption of the media, listening to their views, and not just handing over media is the best course of action as people absorb things differently and ""parents just don't understand""."
history,ffjsllb,t1_ffjes3x,1580005825.0,Saying that they teach it in history class and then prompting the idea that the users history class did not teach it is nonsense. Stating YOU learned it in YOUR history class is factual. No need to debase an individual whose schooling may in part have failed them whilst they are in the pursuit of knowledge.
PS4,ff0afbr,t1_ff06qr4,1579466894.0,"Half of your comment makes it clear that you are concerned with people involved in gaming culture having to deal with a company like EA. They will always try to fuck the customer first, and will only alter course if forced to when profit is not as absurdly high as it could be. Because there is little other competition due to licensing, a form of Battered Wife Syndrome seems to crop up in the consumer base and it is all part of the marketing plan in the end."
PS4,ff06u7s,t3_equcpe,1579465791.0,"If all else fails, turn off notifications."
PS4,ff04nyz,t1_ff01vu5,1579465191.0,Pride and having ethical standards for the way you and your fellow man are manipulated are not the same.
movies,feo9sdx,t1_feo84mn,1579297109.0,"I was commenting more on the general approach to most recent franchise films as a whole, not just Hulk. Disney owns most of them, so it is easy to point and say that I don't enjoy the method they have used so far. If Disney bothered to work out the narrative they want to tell before filming the movies, it would go a long way."
PS4,feldnc5,t1_felapva,1579219717.0,Which is my point. The idea of profitting from it initially and gaining good will later at the expense of the initial consumers now misinformed decision is bad. The content should have always been in the game and misinforming the initial consumer of scarcity is wrong. This is a bad marketing tact that has a good will gain from a portion of the consumer basis baked in after a needless manipulation through pre-order FOMO.
movies,fel7glp,t1_feksxki,1579215699.0,"Franchise movies require the viewer to fill in too much with their own reasoning for the films to function well by themselves. I have a hard time calling these good movies when they often abandon storylines, character arcs, and entire world building concepts and do not use the mediums full strength. That is the biggest issue I have with franchise filming. Disney can just make more, so why bother making one truly great?"
PS4,fel4lj1,t1_fekutxh,1579213935.0,It is the whole point of this post though...
PS4,fekrn5t,t1_fekqsug,1579206182.0,"It is artificially induced fomo and a needless manipulation tactic of the early consumers, now being presented as a gift to later consumers."
PS4,fekosg9,t1_fejuxzy,1579204493.0,"It is well known that games drop in price. If someone bought at launch, they paid over twice as much as I did. It clearly costs more to play a game on day one. Having cosmetic items ""early"" in a single player game by paying day one prices, only to have the incentive made pointless by releasing the incentives for free later, is not logical or fair at all."
PS4,fekiyma,t3_epip5q,1579201022.0,"I paid $25 for this game by waiting until after launch. The preorder crowd paid $60, which is a pretty big difference in cost. It is both very cool and super shitty to give this for free to the entire playerbase. God of War did this is as well. I bought GoW for $5..."
NoStupidQuestions,fefanco,t3_eooido,1579052113.0,"If society and an individuals personal circle have a net gain from an addiction experienced by an individual, you will never hear it referred to as an addiciton. Good feelings are what people get addicted to (sometimes wires get crossed and bad feelings feel good) and having somewhat direct control over manipulating those feelings is usually not something humans do inherently well. This includes food, drugs, media, excercise, money and any pursuit of happiness that can be attained with enough effort."
IAmA,fdnshwb,t1_fdmrz86,1578591939.0,I would not judge any individual based on my internet findings alone or assume that I am able to understand a persons motives based on what group I have chosen to associate them with. The leap in logic being asked here is to assume OP has this all figured out and knows these strangers well enough through his perspective to accurately provide context to others.
IAmA,fdlxyxe,t1_fdlv6cz,1578535167.0," Critical thinking does not provide me an excuse for generalizing in bad faith to prove a point. The idea of it being a mostly online group is also an assumption that is helpful to my point and is not derived from the fact that this is happening in a park, though OP does mention a private chat group that he is somehow aware of as well. All of this is mostly to say that interacting with strangers in a confrontational manner is not civil. If the purpose of his actions are to improve the parks social atmosphere, the examples OP has provided do not justify his approach."
IAmA,fdlpqas,t1_fdloi75,1578529553.0,"I think you missed my point or are choosing not to engage it. The apparent ""representatives"" of any online group are not capable of portraying and accurately representing any groups actual interests because the majority does not vocalize there interests as such, and cannot be determined without a great deal more data about the majority of individuals themselves."
IAmA,fdlmbfn,t1_fdljohc,1578527255.0,"I could look up almost any group online and it would still not inform me about the actual people being associated with whatever group is being attached to them, whether they accept the label or not. In other words, the vocal minority of any group are outliers in and of themselves and are incapable of representing a majority, even when similar goals seem to align."
politics,fdl4got,t1_fdl32q2,1578516889.0,"I understand that concept. The wording is too strong to make your point very well, but I do not think you are entirely wrong by any means."
IAmA,fdl3dd0,t1_fdl2dsw,1578516366.0,I was thinking the same thing.
IAmA,fdl22q2,t1_fdl0hy8,1578515719.0," I have not had any interactions with any PUA person of any kind that I am aware of. I spend a lot of time in public spaces around moderate crowds and have a tendency to notice a subgroup of ""people watchers"". OP has repeatedly offered enough personal perspective for me to feel comfortable stating that it is not being done for the benefit of others so much as to occupy his thoughts and day, which will likely lead to people being judged unfairly by OP."
IAmA,fdkzokf,t1_fdky9j4,1578514450.0,"""They"" is what I take issue with. How are you determining the group mentality and authority of individuals from the internet? They is just as likely a subgroup who are louder than the group they claim to represent as a whole. To be clear, I know very little about any organized group calling themselves PUA. I am applying the basic concept that the outspoken portion of a group never really represents the larger whole that they claim to, especially on the internet."
politics,fdkyez0,t1_fdkqqd7,1578513725.0,"You went from ""directly responsible for"" to ""it's complicated"" very quickly."
IAmA,fdkwyky,t1_fdkvz8j,1578512872.0,"It is safe to say that you do not know what other individuals are thinking, or the motives of the specific individuals that OP finds himself monitoring."
IAmA,fdkvrw5,t1_fdkt3m7,1578512173.0,You definitely do not know that.
IAmA,fdkokw6,t1_fdkjitn,1578507896.0,That is not something a shy person would do...smh
IAmA,fdkn081,t1_fdkkshi,1578506944.0,"That sounds like you excercising your personal goal at the expense of the goals of others in a public space, which is wrong. Are these people being bad? What do you mean by pickup artist and how do you define. This sounds like a waste of everyones time, which may be your goal. To be clear: poet good, behavior moderator bad."
YouShouldKnow,fdklckq,t1_fdkhvnf,1578505932.0,"You just described a common thought excercise as weird, and don't see what is weird about that?"
YouShouldKnow,fdkkwtk,t1_fdkg5j5,1578505696.0,"Your particular department may genuinely be concerned with safety and not be trying to screw people on traffic and speeding stops, but the U.S. police force at large absolutely does abuse minor traffic violations as cause. Also, why is 10 a lot of fixit tickets for a night? I concede that if the population were in the low thousands that may be a lot. I don't want to drone on, but not giving someone a ticket should be standard procedure in these scenarios."
