Then again, your mother in law being from the UK might not have realized why it was such a big deal. I‚Äôm not sure how she couldn‚Äôt realize, since plane tickets are so expensive and traveling with young children is such a hassle, but giving her the benefit of the doubt, she may not have realized that leaving Hawaii for another state is a bigger difference than leaving, say, Minnesota for another state."

If you started itching badly during pregnancy, whether from a condition like cholestasis or something more minor, it could have become a habit. 5 months postpartum is still a stressful time, and it‚Äôs possible that your stress is manifesting in severe itching, rather than something more organic like dry skin causing your intense itching.

Are we talking three kids under 5, in which case she would definitely get zero of her own work done and they‚Äôd probably find some devilish way to undo work she‚Äôs already been paid for, or are they a little older (maybe ranging from 5-10) and she could probably get something done if she sets her laptop up in an area where she can still supervise the kids at play/watching movies/not being absolute hellions because they‚Äôre not toddlers anymore?

You worry about your guests‚Äô enjoyment, not tripping walking down the aisle, not getting left at the altar, how you‚Äôll look in your pictures, etc. Your fianc√© has a beautiful dream, but I don‚Äôt think your actual wedding is the best time to fulfill it. He doesn‚Äôt usually dress in women‚Äôs clothing, so might not be comfortable in the dress of his dreams. He‚Äôll also end up with no pictures of that first dance where he looks like his authentic self, just his dream version (which may or may not live up to the expectations he had as a child). I agree with everyone who has suggested a photo shoot of him in the dress, or a smaller ceremony/party with supportive friends and family to witness his dream. My wedding was wonderful, but I didn‚Äôt wear a ‚Äúdream‚Äù dress or have a ‚Äúdream‚Äù ceremony, and I‚Äôm glad.

If you purchase off your registry on Amazon and spend a certain amount, you end up getting 20% off diapers for a year which is awesome. Breastfeeding is definitely cheaper than formula. Host a Sip and See after your baby is born and invite your friends and family (not tacky to throw your own Sip and See the way it might be to throw your own baby shower) and you‚Äôll probably get some gifts then.
