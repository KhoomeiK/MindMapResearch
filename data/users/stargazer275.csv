dogs,ffnpcqd,t1_ffnmhe8,1580068916.0,"That’s indeed awesome! I didn’t know about whale eyes until recently tbh. There’s probably more I need to learn about it. But you’re right, you always have to be there to read body language. A picture or a description takes things out of context. 

I was talking about a very specific dog that I know. People often think she’s friendly because she holds eye contact with approaching strangers, but her body is tense, still, and her eyes are dinner plates. It’s not until they hear the growling that they understand this dog is actually telling you to back off. 

The play growl comment is about a different dog who is very vocal when he’s on play mode. Now this one, people always consider aggressive. But he’s play-bowing, mouth open, and butt-wiggling. He’s just loud."
dogs,ffnlw7d,t3_eu972i,1580067615.0,"There are multiple types of growling. Coupled with a tense body language and 'whale eyes', growling can indeed be a signal to ""go away"", but there really is such thing as a play growl!"
dogs,ffmdp6i,t3_eu4q1q,1580053043.0,"I have a couple ideas. 

1) Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. There’s a reason why they’re very popular apartment dogs. They’re small, social, affectionate, quick to learn and juuust energetic enough to avoid being called a total couch potato. Plus they’re kinda fancy with four names and the word “king” in it. 

Here’s their AKC page: 

https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/cavalier-king-charles-spaniel/

Why you might not want them: being a scent hound, they may not be the most reliable off-leash. But then again, 30ft leashes exist. 

2) Boston Terrier. They’re as energetic as any terrier, but that only means they will appreciate the hikes and camping trips. They’re sociable, sensitive, adaptable and very people-oriented. I don’t know about trainability though. Some people say they’re kinda bull-headed, but some others say they’re very quick to learn. I suppose it depends on the trainer?

AKC page: https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/boston-terrier/

Why you might not want them: they do lack the floof factor, which seem to be important to you. Oh and of course, the question about the trainability. I have to say though, a stubborn dog doesn’t mean they’re dumb or untrainable. Some are just smart enough to question what’s in it for them. 

3) Havanese. So they’re smaller than what you’re looking for, but they’re affectionate, gentle, and calm. If you don’t mind carrying the dog during those hiking trips - because this one probably can’t keep up - they make a great companion for someone who’s home a lot. This is also a breed that probably won’t mind the 20-minute walks during the days when you’re not hiking. They do get really attached to their owner and probably would shadow you wherever you go, which sounds like something you’re looking for. 

AKC page: https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/havanese/

Why you might not want them: there’s the high-maintenance grooming, and there’s the fact that they’re kinda hard to find depending on where you are. They’re certainly not a breed any random person can name off the top of their heads, so if you’re looking to rescue specifically, you might be looking for a while. 

Do keep in mind that I have never owned any of these breeds myself. I’ve read about them, heard stories from owners, met some at a nearby park and worked with their mixes as a rescue volunteer. But there are hundreds of dog breeds out there and sometimes I forget a trait or two. Luckily, this is Reddit, and I’m sure people would be more than happy to correct me if I’m wrong. Always listen to as many advice as possible, and meet as many different individual dogs as possible before making a decision. 

Good luck, I’m excited for you!"
dogs,fflhxfy,t3_eu4n7f,1580039918.0,"Break the routine. Pick up your leash, put it down again, pretend to read a magazine, pick your leash back up, sit down, etc... you know what I mean. Do this without paying any attention to the dogs (no eye contact, no talking). The more you do this, the less predictable your leaving routine becomes. Leave *only* when your dogs have fully settled (laying down, relaxed body). 

Good luck."
dogs,ffk658f,t1_ffk5xpl,1580017136.0,"You know what, I think so too. Yorkies are just the first thing that pops into my head."
dogs,ffk5fm4,t1_ffk4tc6,1580016457.0,"Oh I don’t know... it heavily depends on the child. I taught 5th graders (9-11) and I know I definitely can’t trust some of them with a Chihuahua. I gave a tour to a family with a 10 and an 8 year old today, and I really really don’t think they’re ready for a puppy. The 10-year old is far too rough and impatient for an animal who is too young to exercise impulse control. 
 
But still. All depends on the children’s personalities."
dogs,ffk4ft1,t3_eu1id0,1580015525.0,"I’m really sorry about your previous dogs. I do believe you are a very caring, compassionate pet owner who has been repeatedly stuck in a sucky situation. I’m glad you’re ready to try again. 

My only concern with small dogs is that sometimes children don’t know how to behave around them. They look like a toy and children often treat them like a toy - and that’s not good. Big dogs don’t get intimidated by a running, screaming child as easily - but life is very scary when you only weigh 10 pounds, and you know what scared dogs do. Please note that I’m not talking down on your children or your parenting ability - this is simply something you must think about and work with. 

Now that we’ve got that out of the way... how about a Yorkie? I know they can be yappy when they’re bored or seeking attention, but if you buy them interactive toys like dog puzzles and the like, plus lots of tricks training and outdoor play (you did mention frisbee throwing on a daily basis), they can be sweet as pie. The ones I’ve worked with are all actually very quiet! Do keep in mind, though, every individual is different - and Yorkies in general have the tendency to be a barker. 

I was also about to suggest Pekingese, but since it’s also a snub-nosed breed, and I have only worked with one individual, I think I’ll scratch that off my list. Havanese is another calm sweet little dog that comes to mind, but I’ve never worked with one at all. Hopefully more people will have better suggestions. 

Good luck!"
dogs,ffk32va,t1_ffk2jrh,1580014301.0,"Nono of course lol! It’s just that sometimes people douse it down with water and call it a day. That’s not enough - as long as the dog can still smell the urine, it’ll be hard to break the habit. So I was checking if you’re taking extra measures to be super sure the urine is gone - maybe by using a special pet cleaning product or something.

And yea crate training sounds like a good idea here. Holler if you have any questions regarding that!

Congrats on your new four-legged friend btw!"
dogs,ffk2agl,t3_eu23if,1580013608.0,"So, uh... how have you been cleaning after him? Carpets unfortunately retain urine smell rather well, and dogs pee wherever it smells like pee. So, when you say “carpet”, is this like a giant rug, or is it your flooring? If it is the former, honestly, I’d really start considering just throwing it out. If it’s the latter... well... you might wanna hire a professional carpet cleaning service. Sorry. 

Remember that dogs only start avoiding peeing inside once they’ve established that the house is their home. With the amount of time youve had this dog, this is unlikely to happen. This might explain why the dog is good as gold in the foster family, but seem to forget all his training in yours. 

Worst case scenario you potty train him from scratch. I’m sure there are endless advice about that in this sub alone. Probably moreso in the puppy owners sub. Good luck!"

dogs,ffjqco8,t1_ffjfnhj,1580004259.0,"OP, this is great advice.

Do you *want* to train this dog? If yes, I’d like to reiterate this user’s comment: it’s gonna take time (*months!*), energy and effort. No amount of training works in 3 weeks. Especially with a behavior like this. 

Judging by how you said “the bond isn’t there” though, it already sounds like you’re ready to give up? If you are, then it doesn’t matter whether or not this behavior is correctable. “Dog training” is really all about the humans in the end, after all. If you don’t want to commit, then find someone who does. We won’t judge, it doesn’t mean you’re a bad person. Just means you’re not Cooper’s match. Think about it carefully. 

I gotta add though, it sounds like you’re a very anxious person yourself. Do you think *you* freak out when you encounter another dog in your walks, even if only internally? Do you think Cooper reacts to that? Because dogs can definitely tell when their handlers are tense, and they react accordingly."

Independent, intelligent, stubborn, energetic and just gorgeous as hell. I’m biased because my first dog was a Husky, but they really do leave a lasting impression. I don’t miss vacuuming the house 2-3 times a day, and leash training was hell, but I’d do it all again in a heartbeat next time I have the opportunity to get another dog."
dogs,ffjlp0r,t3_etzobi,1580001125.0,"I don’t understand. Do you intend to keep this dog? Why is it bad that she’s highly adoptable?

Assuming you’re looking to keep the dog, I have to say: I cannot guarantee any amount of training would ever transform her into a kitty-tolerant dog. The tail wag does NOT mean she’s happy - it just means she’s riled up. None of us can observe the dog’s body language right now. It is possible that she’s just curious. But for the safety of your cat, I would advise you to assume the worst and keep them separated or very closely monitored at all times for now. 

There’s a TV show (available on YouTube) where a dog trainer and a cat trainer (ma boi Jackson Galaxy) helps owners with both cats and dogs integrate their pets. I suppose that’s a starting point if you want to look into it. I’ll come back with the TV show’s title in a bit, I cannot remember it right now.

Edit: I have returned. The show is unfortunately titled Cat vs Dog.

Just keep in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all answer for dog training, and the advice you see on the show are tailored specifically for the animal they’re working with. IF you do intend to keep this dog, your best bet is always a behaviorist - one you see in person, not behind a screen."
dogs,ffjkkjn,t3_etym9z,1580000350.0,"1) A tired dog is a happy dog. If you cannot make time to exercise your dog, then you’re not ready to have one.

2) Dogs communicate with us all the time, we just gotta learn how to understand them

3) Our idea of affection is very human-centric. Understand that dogs can show you love without jumping up or licking your face, and how you can show love without hugging, grabbing or carrying your dog all the time. 

4) How much do you know about dogs really? Since they’re the world’s most popular pet, it almost feels like anyone can have them - but that’s not true. Ask yourself what information you’re missing (nutrition? Behavior?) and ask aaaaaall the questions. Do not ever apologize for being curious. You’re making a 15-year commitment here, you want to know what you’re doing!

5) This is less of a tip and more of a rambling behind a soapbox because I’m an animal shelter volunteer, but... don’t apologize for being picky. Understand what you’re capable and incapable of handling, and be as detailed as you want with your parameters. 

If you choose to rescue: Do not adopt a fearful or reactive dog if you don’t know what to do with it. Yes, it’s got a sob story, but so do millions of other dogs out there. Do not feel responsible - you’re not the one abusing the dog. You are not going to the shelter to be some dog’s hero. You’re going to the shelter to find yours.

Being a stranger seeing this situation from the outside, I can easily say “put your foot down and tell your parents that if they do not start respecting your boundaries, then you will get a new address and phone number which you will keep to yourself”.

I live with controlling, narcissistic parents too. Though in my case, I moved halfway across the globe when the opportunity arises.

Nobody likes to be in your position, OP. But if you’re not going to do something, then you can ignore it.

dogs,feem8fd,t1_feeim12,1579036600.0,"I think the context is a little misplaced here.

When the person doesn’t have a dog yet, you tell them to do their research before getting a dog. But if the dog is already there, already suffering neglect, and the person learned the hard way that owning animals are so much more than it looks, then the best thing to do is give the dog to someone else. It’s much more important to find the dog a better living accommodation than maintaining the person’s pride.

Should the person be commended for getting the dog in the first place? Probably not. But in situations like this, wagging your finger saying “I told you so” isn’t gonna help anyone. In fact, the person might end up abandoning the dog somewhere instead of surrendering it to a shelter because they don’t want to go through the whole “I told you so” lecture. Are shelters overpopulated? Well no shit sherlock. But if anyone ever finds themselves in a situation where they NEED to give up their dog, I would much much rather have them contact a shelter than tying the dog to a pole in the middle of nowhere.

In short: it’s very important to educate wannabe pet owners that dogs are A LOT of work and they should always always do their research beforehand. But in the context of someone who already made their mistake, I’d just say: “you know what, I’m glad you admit you made a mistake, now give this dog up and don’t ever do this again”. In NO way am I encouraging people to adopt a dog first and then abandon it later. I also have a hard time believing anybody would have that kind of mindset."
dogs,fee8uvr,t1_fedzvso,1579028792.0,"I agree with this 100%. I suppose the problem starts when people give up their dogs and then immediately get another one even if their situation hasn’t changed one bit. *Now* they’re being selfish. 

BUT, I commend people who are mature enough to admit they can no longer care for their animal and then give them up to a reputable rescue or a family friend. It’s much better than tying them to a pole or leaving them in a cardboard box!"
dogs,feblw82,t1_febhzf8,1578960161.0,"I’m gonna hold out hope. There’s stubborn, but then there’s cruel. Because she’s still your friend, I would like to believe she is not a cruel person. This is what you need to get through to her: getting another dog is not a matter of who’s right or whose advice should be taken, it’s a matter of being kind. Kindness means not treating animals as disposable. And if Abby is adopting a dog knowing full well she will not be able to keep the dog for its entire life, then she sees animals as disposable. And thus, it is not kind. 

It’s a very difficult conversation to have. Knowing me, I would actually plan what I’m going to say to make sure I keep frustration and anger from jumping out during the talk. You can try that too if you want. 

Thank you for caring so much. You’re a good friend."
dogs,fea37nb,t3_eo8g6u,1578943904.0,"Trust me, this is a lot harder for you than the dog. Just lead him to his bed while saying “go to bed”, and move away a little bit. If he doesn’t get up and follow you, treat and pet. Eventually you can say “go to bed” and he’ll go to his bed without needing to be led. At night, do the same thing. Don’t make too much of a fuss about the change, and he’ll learn to cope.

Adopt because you have found your perfect match. Keep looking."
dogs,fe42h51,t3_enohbk,1578855100.0,"Always seek professional advice instead of listening to a random Reddit stranger. 

That said, I have an idea that might work. Whenever the older dog growls or shoves the puppy away, get up from the couch and put the older dog in timeout. He can stay in timeout until he calms down. Then, without any talking or much fuss, take him out of timeout and let him rejoin the pack. Rinse and repeat. Timeout spot doesn’t need to be a separate room, it can just be the far corner of the living room bordered by one of those puppy gates. It’s more effective if the dog can still see you anyway. The whole point is “punishing” him by giving time away from his beloved family. Do not babytalk or make much of a fuss when taking dog in and out of timeout. 

Of course, each dog is different and there is no one-size-fits-all training tip. But this one floated to my head and I thought I’d throw it out there. Other redditors will be quick to tell you if this is a good idea or not :)

As someone else already mentioned, puppies have a “license” that sorta compels older dogs to let them get away with things. That said, when the puppy gets too nippy, you might or might not hear your older dog growl. Often, this is not a sign of aggression - it’s just the older dog teaching the puppy how to be a good dog (read: good bois don’t nip!). Of course, monitor for other body language cues that might indicate otherwise. But also keep this in mind and try not to intervene too much. Your older dog can teach your puppy bite inhibition much much better than you can.
