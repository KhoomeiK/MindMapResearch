Overwatch,fed4q1f,t1_fed1thx,1578998754.0,"Hahaha, well that was a pleasent surprise. Now I am in your debt, I'll treat my cats to some treats while chanting probablyA_cat.


These things seem to be reusable, and I strongly believe we should stick to the ""Wrath of a thousand kittens!"", that would mean a thousand kittens per cat-hating person, I think we would be fine with a 100 trebuchets for optimal performance. 20 second reload or so, 10 cats per trebuchets. 



Ultimately, we'd need 999 kittens and about 100 trebuchets for  /u/Byrdmann_ as he seems to already have a cat.

I mean we can't throw those kittens away after they've been flung into his face. So they're reusable for the next person too! That way they also gain the experience for optimal face scratching."
