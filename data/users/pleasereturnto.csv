liberalgunowners,ffs3ch9,t1_ffr4sx8,1580172113.0,"Worked at a gun shop for a bit, a few years back. Feedback on Trump ranged from careful optimism, to careful disdain, to just disdain. Really was a bit of an eye-opener, since I was one of the ""I'll give him a chance"" people back then, but seeing what he ended up doing and saying was one of the things that turned me solidly against him. I'm glad the owner was a level person who didn't have an echo chamber around the news and shit.

Next time I go to a gun shop or the range, I might grab myself some leftist swag before I go, even if I don't exactly lean that way on every topic, I just want to at least show and promote solidarity. I just hope nothing happens again like in that video a while back where a bunch of them shot en masse and about half of them were hitting the ground."

OutOfTheLoop,ffh5a9q,t1_ffgebi6,1579923501.0,"I have a question based on something I heard a long while ago, so I might not have remembered it right. Don't trans (or possibly trans) children that seek treatment get put through counseling before to ensure that they are actually trans, or at least unlikely to regret the decision? I know the same is done for weight-reduction surgeries, because the patient needs to be able to maintain a healthy weight after without regressing back to obesity.

I'm asking because I remember hearing that the process to transition was nowhere near as easy as propaganda makes it sound. It's not like the parents or the child can push it through to make an irreversible life decision that easily."

progun,fet6uwe,t1_fesvimg,1579372318.0,"Same. It's a bad fucking situation, especially for everybody who's not as Republican on any issue except gun rights. The thing is, there's plenty of shit to be worried about besides guns.

We just need to keep at it for however long it takes. It goes both ways, and this is the result of fudds putting their blind faith in Republicans, and the general gun community following their ""best option"". For a better America, it is not enough to get Republicans into power, that is just a short term solution. We need to write, protest, and vote, such that neither Democrats nor Republican can discount the gun owner population. As impotent as it now, Democrats don't bother appealing to us, and Republican feel safe being passive about our interests, or outright hostile.

I'm not saying all Democrats are better choices, just trying to think of a better way than what we have, which is an unstable pile of dogshit. One wrong move or position flip, and we could face an even worse attack on gun rights than anything Democrats have been able to do so far, purely by virtue that if he does anything, a multitude of his supporters will continue to support him, while the anti-gun crowd will be glad to take advantage."
progun,fest0es,t1_fesqj97,1579368730.0,"I agree. 4D chess is nothing but a justification after the fact of anything he does. I've had fudds argue with me that he and the NRA dropped bump stocks and silencers to appease the ""liberals"", and that they were the best forces for gun rights in the country. And if I remember the discussions from months ago, those same people were saying stuff like ""he's planning on using bump stocks as a bargaining chip for silencers"" and shit like that.

But what has he done in reality? Not a damn meaningful thing. The cult of personality is strong.

Personally, I believe he's so fucked in everything he does, and so milquetoast to regressive (because he can swing wildly depending anything) on gun rights, that it would be better to pick literally anybody else, save for the worst in terms of gun rights. It would be easier to block a democrat on that single issue, than Trump on nearly all of them."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fesqsca,t1_fesfcvq,1579368018.0,"I don't think it's quite that easy, because being racist is something that someone is. Someone doesn't need to be racist to say racist things.

I think something more accurate is ""Supporting racism ironically is still supporting racism"". If you believe people have a social responsibility to not support racism, then that implicates them of being irresponsible.

I don't think it makes much of a difference, but it's just the semantics of it."

WatchRedditDie,fe9yzux,t1_fe9de8u,1578942676.0,"Same. Not on the t or gay or whatever, but I can't stand seeing this shit. I don't support censorship, and I don't feel subs like this should just be removed (I know, private site and all, but whatever), but this is still pretty blatantly hateful rhetoric. And it's on other posts that pop up here too. 

I look for places like this to get a fucking wave of common sense, people actually believing in liberty, freedom of speech, and all that shit. Not some anti-vaxxer tier misinformation like ""trannies want to mutilate and inject your kids full of hormones"", like it doesn't take a shitton of therapy and evaluation to even be eligible for that shit as a kid. It's not as easy as getting fucking takeout, like some would have you believe. In a similar way to having a liposuction or some other weight reduction operation, if it doesn't look like it'll help you get better, it's better to hold off on the operation.

To relate this to something more people might understand, I think this, as well as abortion issues, might be the ""Gun Show Loophole"" of the right. Ignore the reality of the situation to create some sort of panic. Substitute facts for a bombastic story that never needs a source. At this point, there's very little credible reason or cause to be afraid of guns, abortion, or trans people, but there's a hell of a lot of media attention."

SampleSize,fdkxwkb,t3_elor36,1578513425.0,I feel like the actual most toxic social media is the comments section on news sites.
SampleSize,fdkwzdd,t1_fdk2fk7,1578512885.0,"I feel like 4chan's toxicity is very dependent on what kind of person you are, and how you are affected by what other people say. I've been on for years, and it's hardly toxic off /pol/, and though /pol/ has some influence on other boards, people usually call it out when they start up.

I've always found toxicity on 4chan to be ephemeral too. No one can attack you outside of a single thread if you don't give them the methods to do so. I'd rather face a moment of toxicity on 4chan, than have some rando harass me through pms, or stalk me through threads, or try to dox me, like you see on reddit so many times. And that's because it's so much easier to do that on reddit."

I don't get how being a ""scavenger"" is all that ridiculous or contemptible. It's the foundation of economics. Someone can find something and sell it to someone else, possibly by making it more appealing through either transforming or improving it? It's a tale as old as time."

4chan,fdh31q8,t1_fdgp3gm,1578414307.0,"He's being retarded, lots of work in jail is office shit, or adjacent to it. It's not like they only do the stuff they show in movies/tv, there's a ton of paperwork, records, office politics, etc. to keep track of, and it's not like they're any smarter than the average office person. I know people who've worked over 20 years and have only gotten stabbed once or twice. Funnily enough, the most dangerous thing in a prison is probably the prison itself, because all those people who've worked decades are getting respiratory issues because the state won't pay to maintain the paint or ventilation system."
savedyouaclick,fdfqc2h,t1_fdfovky,1578367659.0,"I'm huge into burgers, and though I was skeptical, I think they're pretty decent. Of the ones I've tried, Hard Rock Cafe's was amazing, Burger King's wasn't very good, and Hardee's wasn't great, but not awful. I also tried all of them next to a regular burger from the same place, and Hard Rock's was the only one that tasted nearly exactly like a real meat burger, which wasn't unexpected, given that it's a step up from the others.

From what I've heard though, Burger King's burger can vary a lot depending on where you get it, so I think they need to make sure people are cooking them consistently. Though I haven't heard anything about Hardee's fake meat burger, I suspect it's the same. You'll probably have better chances if you're in a place with good restaurants though."

Like some other people, I liked the first few, but it got sort of old after a while. After that I ended up reading some criticisms on /tg/ which weren't the only reason, but were part of the reason why I eventually started ignoring them. Now, knowing what was going on from your side, I think I understand and can sympathize.

I think you deserve to be happy, and if that means putting down Ami stories in favor of stories or creative shit that you actually enjoy, I think you should do that. I know I can't make you feel safe from people who make threats and whatnot, but I really hope you can move past it, whether that means leaving this account behind or whatever other measure it might take. I don't mean to make this sound easy, but I just want to say that I hope you can do what you want to do.

Just as a quick question, not as an accusation, but to satisfy my own curiosity, did you ever make/sockpuppet your own threads, post a story, and then delete the threads/stories so people couldn't call you out or gang up on you in the threads themselves? I'm just asking because that was one of the things I saw on /tg/. Before, I believed it, but now, I'm willing to believe it was just some random accusations."
