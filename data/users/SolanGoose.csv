He's probably going to do it when I start going for public walks, but like, puppy, whole new world. Of course he's going to be a bit of a dick.

Next obedience course is in March, so I should have ample time to work on his leash manners before that. Next time I see the owner, I'll ask what the hell is up with it going on and me just finding out now."
puppy101,ff8wcvc,t1_ff8vijr,1579698268.0,"Thank you for the reply!

He's a newf, so he will get quite big(16 weeks tomorrow). Plus, he *only* uses a collar in class. I have had no suggestions for a halter from the owner/head instructor, either.

 The lady I'm talking about seems to reason that I should use it now while he's small to get him acclimated to it for later, buuuut if I do my job right there shouldn't *be* a later for it, right?"

I have no idea about the ins and outs of genetics for this(they are crossing with dogs as well). Hunters here know they're bigger. I have had my hands on skins that are huge. Taxidermist friend usually orders wolf mounts for them.  They do not always run from you immediately, either.
