beagle,fcj9182,t3_ehgr8o,1577680293.0, I always wonder what [animals truly think](https://youtu.be/4k2RZ1nGWVA) of their young when they see them. Do they think they are cute? Are they overwhelmed with love? Do they see the young as a mission to make sure they stay alive?

curledfeetsies,fc9427a,t3_egp29x,1577546695.0," Seconding this. My mother‚Äôs 18 y.o. cat is diagnosed with dementia after exhibiting the same ‚Äúyelling at night‚Äù issue. Meds helped the cat a ton though, his nighttimes are peaceful now. Perhaps OP‚Äôs [cat can also benefit](https://youtu.be/hNJl5HE6d4Y) from similar meds?"
curledfeetsies,fc930bg,t3_egonjp,1577546201.0, My old man [would lost kitty](https://youtu.be/wP1Ge6awDzY) howl if he was sleeping and we turned the lights off and went to bed without him. We made sure one of us brought him to bed at night. He lived to be 28 ish.
