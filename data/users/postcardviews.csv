underlords,ffe1bb8,t3_eso7lr,1579834129.0,"I love LC builds! These are some that I've won with at Boss: 

[10 alliances](https://i.imgur.com/toOaUDM.jpg), sadly no trolls, went to 10 and added snapfire for dragon. 

[9 alliances](https://i.imgur.com/q7IePlW.jpg), had great luck this time with double midas, though I think deso would've been better.   
I love adding Lycan to a druid/LC build for easy savage/human, he's such a great unit. I miss hunter glory days!"

aww,fe6wlfk,t1_fe6gqi8,1578906624.0,Why? Because I criticised your favourite doggo poems? If you're this fragile maybe you're the one who should step away from Reddit.
aww,fe65uq4,t1_fe5m7lt,1578882468.0,"Can I just ask you a few questions, this is not meant to be an attack I'm simply trying to understand the reasoning behind your writing decisions.

Why do you randomly capitalise words in your poem? It doesn't make any sense to me and makes it visually awful for me to read.

I see that in the 4th line of your poem you've capitalised 'This', however in the 7th and 9th line 'this' is not capitalised, however it once again appears in the second last line with a capital T, but this may be due to the rule of capitalising the first letter in a sentence as per English grammar rules, which is also applied in the last line of your poem; However this rule has not been applied to the rest of your poem, and neither do you capitalise 'I'.

What is the significance of capitalising 'Free' and 'Doesn't'?

Is the point of this novelty account to emulate a dog trying to write poetry? Is it considered 'cuter' to write like this?"
underlords,fe0d7tv,t3_enct6w,1578810539.0,"I used to loooove hunters. The nerf to the alliance made them suck now unless you committed to 6 hunters, and most of the time you need to 3 star the units or they fall off late game. TB, Beastmaster and Lycan are all melee which means often by the time they have mana to use their ability they've already lost too much health."
DotA2,fdz5pzn,t1_fdxb660,1578786981.0,"It looks good but doesn't feel thematic, in fact it looks like a Hearthstone set to me."
aww,fdd1gg3,t1_fdcz5ht,1578291021.0,"needs more random capitalisation of words mid sentence but remember to always do lower case I, add some text emojis too ;@)! Remember to write about being the best boi. When you're done I'll comment on how it's so cute and someone must be cutting onions because every one of his poems makes me weep about my literature major."

Steam,fcbrrjx,t3_egwn9n,1577590243.0,"Stardew Valley for sure! My favourite chill out game. Witcher 3 GOTY is great if you're down for a 100hr+ open world RPG to accompany your Netflix binge. I'm thinking about picking up Resident Evil 2 personally.  If you haven't played the Portal series, definitely pick them up, not very dated at all and Portal 2 has fantastic voice acting!"
gaming,fbyvgq7,t1_fbxg9tw,1577227420.0,"Yeah the DS animation where Glenn used the Masamune to cut the mountain open was sooooo cool! I bought the PC port but I'm going to get a switch if they decide to port it across. Maybe one day they'll port/remake Golden Sun too... 

Oh and Merry Christmas! I hope you have a great day."
