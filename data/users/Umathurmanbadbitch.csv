GetMotivated,fe3lb3i,t1_fe2ttpq,1578850303.0,"That sub is full of sanctimonious assholes, it's AA in a subreddit and i bet it has similar success rates as far as helping people with their alcohol problems goes.

Edit: I should be less harsh. Any resource to help someone deal with a drinking problem should be explored if there is some chance of success. Although I do not think that sub should be championed."
