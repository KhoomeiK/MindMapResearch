You might wanna partner with another barber and have someone able to share the overhead. 
Good luck."

Being depressed is like being fat. If you keep eating like shit and not going to the gym you'll never get fit. Being depressed feels miserable. But in order for you to rid yourself of it, at least to some degree, you actually have to do something about it. Regardless of how you feel.
