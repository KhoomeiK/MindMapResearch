AskWomen,fe6kpwv,t1_fe6k7db,1578894115.0,"No need. Ask away. 

The second lady, yeah a bit. I sort of know her so I feel like I should have told her at the time. But also, convinced myself that I should just stay out of it. I’ve blocked him on every platform. 

Overall, that period in my life was not a good one. I’ve blocked a lot of those memories and I am fine leaving them blocked. I don’t think about it much for a few reasons. 

I’ve blocked out the first guys name. I can’t even remember what he looks like. So I couldn’t contact his wife even if I wanted to. 

The second guy... I don’t see how it would do any good to tell her now. It isn’t fair to tell someone something hurtful just to absolve myself of the guilt. It wouldn’t help her. She either knows that he’s cheated (cuz I doubt I’m the only one) and they’ve worked it out. Or she doesn’t know and they’ve found their happiness anyway. Or they haven’t worked shit out and have/will split despite the baby. My telling her does not benefit her in any way."
AskWomenOver30,fe6k4bq,t3_enyv1x,1578893519.0,"30/f and somewhere between 3 and 8. I say somewhere because I blocked a lot of those memories so I’m not 100% sure how many. That was a horrible time in my life. I was young and untethered and felt empowered to experiment. But, it was most definitely not worth it.

Edit: I’m a big supporter of sex positivity. I just feel like the way I went about that whole phase was unhealthy. Take care of yourselves y’all. Have fun but be safe."
AskWomen,fe6jtg9,t1_fe6jqio,1578893223.0,"I regret that I was party in hurting people, whether they knew or not. I don’t really think it’s my place to forgive. But seeking forgiveness from the hurt would only be for my sake and not theirs."
AskWomen,fe6jn96,t3_enyw8c,1578893056.0,"I have. Twice. 

1: He was an unhappily married dude I met for a hookup. I don’t feel bad that I like “stole her man” or anything. He approached me. I was young (but legal) and was experimenting. I thought it was exciting. But I would go back in time and walk away before anything happened. 

2: It was sexting, sort of. He kept trying to draw me into these dirty conversations and I resisted for a long time until I finally gave in, just briefly. Not like full on sexting but like definitely heavy flirting. I was lonely and weak. It was nothing physical but I think it still counts. The whole time I kept trying to steer him into talking to his girl, working through their issues. After that I ghosted him so he couldn’t use me as a crutch anymore. 


I most definitely would not let anything like that happen again. I’m not proud of having done it. It feels like a betrayal of the girl code.

I don’t know what happened with the first guy and his lady. But I really hope they worked their shit out. I heard the second guy is expecting a baby with his lady. I hope that means they’ve gotten through whatever rough patch they had going on."

Hair,fcvcida,t3_ej31xd,1577999226.0,Try toner. It’s less damaging than bleach and will cool down the results of your already bleached hair. But I wouldn’t bleach it again for a few weeks at least. And when you do use low developer. Low and slow.
