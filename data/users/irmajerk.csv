microgrowery,fesd87d,t1_fermxwm,1579364054.0,"Thanks man. Your setup is nice too. I mostly outdoor run to waste hydroponics these days, coz Aussie so we got plenty of sun for free, but I still keep a little tent for winter. I love the grow as much as the product, and also grow a lot of tomatoes and crap.  Also my place now doesn't have a shed (I believe you call it a shop in America?) but I have the materials and a crew to put up a 3x4 metre outbuilding as soon as the weather cools off a bit.

I've never done a kegerator, only what we call king browns (700ml brown glass) and recycled bottles from whatever we were drinking at the time, but I have an old chest freezer with a busted thermostat, I reckon that might work out alright with a few elastic bands and some tape haha. Bookmarked!"
microgrowery,feqgsrc,t1_feob3l3,1579341699.0,"I made an 8% beer with an ounce per litre that worked really well, but I extracted the resin etc from the plant matter before adding it to the already fermented beer. 

 Also a lemon  and bud beer that came in about 11% using champagne yeast and double sugar. that one was about a pound of trim and popcorn buds roughly chopped and mixed through at the start of fermentation. 

 I avoided the chlorophyll issue with the strong beer by carbolating, then extracting the THC etc with a peach based  80% alcohol thing some Serbian neighbours made (they called it Palinka) then evaporating the alcohol off in a slow cooker with a top temp of 110°C then mixing the oil/resin through the beer. Ended up with a lot of bottle sediment because of mixing the extract through right before bottling for carbonation, but it definitely worked.  Yes, we drank the sediment.  Also, we were eating Aussie BBQ when we were drinking the beer, so the fats from the food possibly helped with absorbtion. 

The lemon and bud beer was very strong and effective, but didn't taste that great. It went a weird lime colour and had a strong ""grassy"" underflavour. A 700ml bottle (about 2 glasses) got me about as stoned as maybe two or three cones (or bowls, I believe you Americans call them?) so really not worth it in terms of getting ""value for money"" but I grow so it was just junk weed anyway. I wasn't even gonna bother with it, just give it away for baking or whatever, but my mate suggested we try something new. I wouldn't do it that way again.

My mate who is into distilling likes to put  bunch of little buds in the bottles and top them up with his home made vodka, and that is probably the best way to do it. You can do shots, but I like it best as a boilermaker (pint of beer with a shot of 40% vodka/whiskey/rum depending on where you are added to the pint.)

I don't drink much these days, but it was a fun couple of  experiments. I wouldn't use prime buds though."

TrueCrime,fefw5jd,t3_eovgbt,1579067154.0,"The whole ""I Love A Serial Killer""  thing has a big element of edgelord bullshit, I think. The fact that these people form supposedly intimate relationships with murders who are locked up and never getting out means they feel safe, and they can convince themselves that the feeling of safety is due to their skill as an emotional partner rather than the physical barriers. So they get to play out the fantasy of the perfect relationship, they get the attention via shock value and the ability to appear mysterious and interesting via ""you just wouldn't understand"" without ever being in actual danger. 

I think it has its root in the idea that everyone is special in some way, (which is true) and that the only way to validate that specialness is through the attention of others (which is not).  Being famous makes you more special. And if you have literally nothing massively interesting about you, like most people, once way to get that attention is to be shocking. We see it with teenagers playing Nazi, it's the entire reason that facebook thrives, and I think it plays a big part in why we hear the stories of the ""serial killer lovers.""

Having an interest in abnormal psychology and the history of crime and punishment is something else entirely. I think we as a community are interested in finding ways to make the world a better place. Understanding how and why bad people do the things they do helps us find ways to be better."
TrueCrime,fefvaux,t1_fefqo96,1579066350.0,"We do it with so many things too. Money, violence, desire and acquisition of the object of that desire are drilled into people from the minute they're born.

The mix of ""empowerment through shopping"" and ""if you were better he'd love you more and then wouldn't do those things"" is particularly bothersome to me. I have nieces and I worry for their futures.  Their own parents have been trained the same way.  And I don't know how to explain it to people who are content with work TV sleep and big box stores on the weekends that their children are...doomed.

(sigh. sorry I got stuck on the end of that sentence for ages, and I know we are talking about serial killers and grooming, but ultimately, I am just sad that our world is going to destroy our civilisation to save itself from us and there's nothing we can do about it.

Local police amounted to one full time officer and a civilian clerk.   I was hired by the local council to essentially piece together CCTV footage in a town similar to my own home town, but slightly larger. Lots of farms, and a town centre with suburban housing for around 5000 people. Just masses of raw, low quality CCTV footage, often at very low frame rates and resolutions, but from so many sources it was overwhelming at first.   With patience, it was possible to follow any vehicle from a radius of about 15km around town (the farm areas)  and probably 60% of the housing area just using private camera feeds from gates,  produce stands, home security systems and business CCTV.  Not 100 % visual coverage, but close enough using timestamps to be able to roughly calculate the route and sometimes even the speed of any vehicle between known points, eventually resulting in a fairly complete visual record of a theft from entering a farm shed to footage of suspects unloading stolen goods at their home.  Once the data was compiled, it was handed over to police, who called in help from other towns and they raided and recovered massive amounts of stolen goods. 

That's in a tiny country town. 

Now I'm no expert at this stuff. I got the job because a friend of a friend is the son of the Shire president, and they needed someone who was good with computers and was willing to do a whole bunch of drudge work for very little money. It took weeks and I was bored for most of the time. And I am sure someone much smarter than me has written code that would have done the job much much faster. But that's what's possible in a low camera density area.

I was on exercise at a place in QLD called the Land Warfare Training Centre, which is just military speak for hot wet Mudhole with no direct sunlight and too many biting bugs. On occasion during the day, we would go ""non tactical"" for lectures and demos. During one of these on Camouflage and concealment, we were allowed to have a durrie (cigarette) break,  and being the generous and well the prepared professional soldier I'd been trained to be, I had plenty of spares, so I handed a few out, mostly to the reservists Who'd been attached to us for this course.  About 10 minutes later, my platoon sergeant asked ""Who smokes Marlboros?""  and I stuck up my hand. He proceeded to chew me three new assholes in front of my platoon and the dozen chockos who where attached to us.  I knew it wasn't my butt that the Sarge was loosing his mind over, but I shut up and took it, apologised and took my punishment of ""Emu bobbing""  (searching for butts and other rubbish) at every meal and smoke break for the rest of the course, another 4 days, because I'm not a snitch. 

Later on, my section commander (corporal) pulled me aside and went ""What the fuck, Stroker (my army nickname) you fucking know better than that""  and I quietly explained how I'd passed out a bunch of smokes at break time to some of the reservists (chockos or chocolate soldiers,  meaning soft and likely to melt in the heat), that one of them must have done it, but I didn't want to look  like a little bitch so I just shut up and took it.  Also showed him the top pocket full of butts and the plastic baggie of butts in my pack from previous days.  He snarffed, told me I was a good soldier and a good bloke, but a dumb cunt and don't give out your smokes any more, especially to people from outside our unit. 

He quietly cleared it up with my platoon sergeant, but I still had to do the punishment as a lesson to never trust a chocko. When we got back from exercise, the Sarge bought me a beer and told me he was proud of how I took my lumps and didn't grass, but to always remember that reservists are not professional soldiers and you can't expect them to behave like one of us. 

And that is a big part of why, to this day, I never drop a butt.  Pocket, bin or ashtray.  It makes the world a nicer place AND it makes it harder for the enemy to track your movements."
