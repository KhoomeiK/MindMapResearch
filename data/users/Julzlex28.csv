There are a few exceptions where females are more colorful, like baboon butts, but for the most when the males and females are different colors, it is a message about MALE fitness. 

Have they not seen cardinals? Mandrills? Uakari monkeys? In both it is the males who have more red. But men would never admit, would hate to admit, that often in nature the female picks the male based on HIS fitness. It makes sense, giving reproduction is a greater cost for the female."

Which of course means they have completely and utterly handed over the definition and control of womanhood to men. They have allowed men the final say and according to men, being a woman is a feeling of femininity. The Left has given the fatal blows to women rights that the Right had been been slowly pounding away at.

Also, because femininity is so uncomfortable and oppressive, I don't really believe that a man unable to express himself according to feminine stereotypes is not oppression.

Why not get the entire family counseling? I grew up next to a family whose had kids with weight problems, one that became obese. I hung out with them and played with them and can't imagine how their lives would turn out if they had been removed from their loving home which included an extended family. A lot of the adults had weight problems, so this wasn't any of the issues you talked about.

Obesity due to overindulgance is not the same as physical or sexual abuse or being in a cult or Munchausen by Proxy - which is when kids should be removed.

GenderCritical,fe2fwhq,t3_en8mh3,1578837935.0,"Some comments on hear are accusing the article of letting men get off the hook of childcare, particularly with infants.

But before formula, men didn't help with infant care. Having fathers help feed the baby is based on modern technology. And people seemed to have ignored the comment in the article that women who have worked hard to breastfeed and are attuned to their infants may not want to just stop feeding their child.

Women used to breast feed for up to two years in some cultures. And they carried their babies with them everywhere because men are not designed to feed babies. Hence the invention of the papoose. The difference was that they did not live in a society set up with such a strict public/ private separation. They did not live in the 24 hour cycle where if you caught up on sleep during the day, you could not participate in public life. Even in societies in which women participated in governance (Iroquois and certain northeast cultures where women were allowed to be chiefs, for example) infant care was still mainly performed by women because there was no other way to feed and nurture a baby. The difference, again, was the lack of capitalism and the public/ private divide associated with said capitalism.

The article did not say fathers should not be involved in any childcare duties, and she stated fathers can help in practical ways. My guess would be diapers. But breastfeeding? Come on. Even when women use a bottle for relief, as some commenters have mentioned, the onus of feeding a child falls on women.

And it is our society that has stated that because women are built for nurturing an infant, that's all they are worth. And mainstream feminism, although refuting this, continues to try and force an equal reproductive partnership that has never existed. Mainstream feminism, instead of overhauling the system to be more female friendly, continues within a system based on a male's lifecycle that doesn't involve childcare. And women are burned out for it. And many women in other articles I have read, all liberal women, talk about how they were not ready to leave their babies because they wanted to continue to care for them at a fundamental, biological level. 

And as this biological imperative is crucial to the survival of future generations, instead of denying that women are attuned to babies in ways men aren't (like every other mammalian species on Earth) society should absolutely be reorganized so that it is truly more female-friendly and women can continue to care for their babies while participating in life.

To me this is what this article is saying. Not that we should go back to the 19th century. The author specifically states we shouldn't. What this article is saying is that liberalism has failed women and is limited when it comes to childcare. The problem with our society, of course, is the inability for some to be able to hear criticism of liberalism without thinking that we are suggesting the answer is becoming conservative. There is no third option."

GenderCritical,fcyrgkz,t1_fcyott9,1578085526.0,"Yes, you are cherry picking by trying to find one example of modesty culture that isn't used to oppress women.

Except the modesty culture in the Amish does not in fact apply to men as it does to women, as these sexual abuse scandals show. So the point is moot.

And I am not glossing over what you are saying, I am disagreeing with you and with the idea that due to an individual choice/ reason, an action suddenly doesn't support the patriarchy. The hijab IS the patriarchy. Same with beauty culture. Your individual interpretation doesn't change that. 

Just because you wear makeup for fun doesn't mean you still aren't participating in an industry and giving money to a system that upholds patriarchal beauty culture. Cause you are.

And honestly I am not judging. I wear lipstick to work because I feel I am taken seriously at my job. But I am trying to get out of even that habit because yes, I am upholding the patriarchy, even if I do it to seem ""put together."" Why is it that women must wear makeup in the first place to be put together? Doesn't matter how I interpret it. If all women stopped wearing makeup, regardless of whether SOME are wearing it purely for fun, we would kill toxic beauty culture. We would get rid of the number-one driver of female insecurity and shame - beauty culture. 

And one of the most polluting industries one earth.

But alas, we instead have to keep in mind the feelings of women doing makeup for fun, we have to respect and always remember your ""choice.""

I have friends who are what I call addicted to makeup and outright admit they wear it because they are insecure. One friend cannot go without shaving even the shortest time and gets chemical peels because they are insecure. They recognize it all for what it is and we have talked about how it is passed through generations beginning with their mother making comments about how wonderful it is that people tell them (the mother) they are young-looking. 

And one of these friends I have known since childhood and I recall how at puberty beauty culture, including makeup culture, made us feel fat, ugly, etc. and made us want to starve ourselves and slop on makeup.

I truly believe that the way for my friends and other women and girls to move forward away from the neurosis are for women to band together and just boycott beauty culture like in South Korea. But choice feminism makes that very hard."
GenderCritical,fcynfo0,t1_fcym7ng,1578083320.0,"You know what I mean. Go to trade school, get work experience...don't become dependent on a man. Go to community college. You NEED to be employable."
GenderCritical,fcyn9qz,t1_fcyljjy,1578083232.0,"You are cherry picking and the Amish are a terrible example. They are patriarchal and have had several sexual abuse scandals with males abusing females and the abused females being shamed, and the men getting away with it. Modesty culture goes beyond clothing. And people within the cultures that wear hijab hate hijab and want it changed.

And I guess good for you wearing makeup for fun - and so what? Most women don't, it is often not a choice but social coercion. This is what we call class analysis and what your version of feminism - liberal choice feminism - sorely lacks. Thus why it is completely ineffective."
GenderCritical,fcyacy0,t1_fcy3fm2,1578077073.0,"You seem to be believing in a reality that doesn't exist. She might believe in chastity between both sexes, but that is not what the hijab actually means. If so, is she demanding men wear it too? Modesty culture, which she would be supporting, doesn't go both ways and she can interpret it however she wants, but she is still actively taking part in an action the oppresses millions of women worldwide. 

I know of no woman who wears makeup for fun. Even those who claim to then state they cannot go out of the house without it. Why? Because makeup is used first and foremost to pressure women in being insecure. This makeup is fun and artistic bull is what is sold to women today to ignore how feminism once focused on beauty culture as harmful and pressuring women to always be young and look f@$$ble for men.

As for being a housewife. I get why some women want to stay home and focus on their kids, but they need to get a college degree and work experience. I sincerely believe they should have a part time job at least because if something happens to their husband or relationship, they are screwed. This is the reality in how patriarchy has designed childrearing. A woman who has made herself dependent on a man is really putting herself at risk. I had a neighbor who did this and when her husband dies she went out and married right away because she had NO CHOICE. Being a stay at home Mom took away her future agency."

It is very hard to critique, and I think part of it is that it is viewed as the epitome of leftist progressive culture cause of the gay rights factor.

Even if it is anything but progressive towards women and needs to be called out as regressive and sexist."

All these TRAs never acknowledge the passivity involved in the female gender role - unless it is some sexual submissive bullshit at which they can play at then step out of. They have no understanding of how that is how women are supposed to act and behave IN REAL LIFE.

It reminded me of the TIM on Facebook who said that gender roles are neutral and I can pick one. He could say and believe that statement because he is male..."

GenderCritical,fciojv4,t1_fcio1xt,1577666163.0,"Yes, but imagine if women never wore bras - which are unnatural to begin with - and their breasts actually developed the ability to support themselves. Actually developed muscle tone. Because bras prevent that muscle development. 

And that's the point I am trying to make. Bras were not designed for comfort they were designed for shape and youth. They may cause some of the very problems we are describing."
