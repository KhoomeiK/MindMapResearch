TaylorSwift,ff98q95,t3_esdmmp,1579707438.0,SHE SAID FUCK
TaylorSwift,ff64r03,t1_ff61pwi,1579619096.0,I wish I could hug her. I can’t even imagine.
TaylorSwift,fdkorb8,t3_elw1xe,1578508003.0,This almost made me cry! They must be really sweet.
cats,fdijj5s,t3_elknis,1578444324.0,An absolute beauty!
cats,fdijg26,t3_elkntv,1578444270.0,"Try Tidy Cats free and clean unscented!!! I love this litter, I just started buying it and it is AMAZING. I was all about natural litters like swheat scoop and feline pine etc. We’re in an apartment now and I really don’t want it to smell. I can’t smell anything in this litter unless I get real close and flip the lid! It’s 10 bucks. They have scented ones too if you like scented litter and a lightweight version that is more expensive. I usually spend between 10 and 15 bucks per box. They have a giant bucket of this kind too, but it ends up being cheaper buying two of the smaller ones."
TaylorSwift,fco8ux9,t3_ehvbik,1577826374.0,Hell yeah man! Looks good. When I got mine I thought... “well everyone’s gonna have to kiss off cause I’m wearing this every time I go out for the next three months...at least..”
TaylorSwift,fco7q7b,t3_ehw6v7,1577825690.0,Billboard this year! Her speech. Mostly the part when she said about if you’re in this room then he needs something from you. I can’t say the masters battle is my favorite because I’m sure it’s causing her a lot of pain. But I think she’s going to come out on top and make such a lasting impression.
TaylorSwift,fco6kfi,t3_ehyoyk,1577825045.0,"King of My Heart. Such a jam, but I cry when I sing the words cause she loves him so much and is so happy and content finally."
TaylorSwift,fc56d3i,t3_eg8bja,1577445515.0,"I felt the same exact way! My boyfriend and I really liked it! But when we were all leaving the theater everyone was like, “well that just shouldn’t have been made a movie! Hahaha...”  People are strange and just go with the flow. My favorite song was Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer’s. And our girl was flawless! I thought their fur looked great. Some of the CG was funny, yes. My only complaint was the the sound was off. The music outweighed their voices a good bit of the time."
cats,fc2govm,t3_efmr5y,1577359235.0,What little treasures! So glad you got both!
TaylorSwift,fbwplkc,t3_eeuwxv,1577156062.0,"Man, I’d kill for that coloring book.. what a great haul!"
