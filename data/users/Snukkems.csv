>In the Western world, afro-textured hair has historically been treated with disdain, by members of all ethnicities. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the Atlantic slave trade saw black Africans forcibly transported from Sub-Saharan Africa to North America and, upon their arrival in the New World, their heads would be shaved in effort to not only prevent the spread of lice but to erase their culture, as many Africans used hairstyles to signify their tribal identity, marital status, age, and other personal characteristics.[1] Early on, both men and women would wear headscarves in order to protect their scalps from sunburn and lice but, as time progressed, these hair wraps became more associated with women, who began to wear them in various fashions, based on their region and personal style. In the 19th century, when slaves were no longer being imported from Africa, quality of life increased for them somewhat as they became more valuable in their owners' eyes. Now enjoying Sundays off, black women would take the day to style their hair, uncovering it for church services but keeping it wrapped Monday through Saturday. As traditional styling tools weren't available to them, black women began to use butter, kerosene, and bacon grease and combs meant for livestock to style their hair.

Obama-Biden actively tried to cut Social Security and Medicare in 2013 but Bernie Sanders rallyed a bunch of working class folks and congressmen to stonewall the effort until it had to be sidelined.


Basically every critique you have of Trump, Obama actively paved the way for by refusing to close any loopholes, maintain his progressive coalition, actively lost the house with reckless abandon due to poor advice from handpicked staff (who went to create a secret blacksite when they were mayor of Chicago tha tortured teenagers)

We remember Obama fondly because of his contrast with the guy currently in office, but history is not going to remember his political choices favorably in the long term"

But after all that stuff 


We would have sex and then she'd ask for gas money or something and then it turned out she was just giving it to a boyfriend.

And she started just obviously faking enjoying it, like not even be close to getting it near her vagina and she's moaning like she's in a cheap porno. 

 I was with her for 3 or 4 years, so I knew what it sounded like when she was enjoying it

 it was just obvious I was a like a washing machine just there to drop a load off, she'd get gas money or whatever it was she needed, and I found out she was giving it to her boyfriend. who was supposed to be a gay friend she was just hanging out with, not that I would have minded if she was honest I was sort of playing the field at the time myself. 


And there was a point where she cryingly (fake I learned later) confessed some heinous stuff and tried to play me and her new boyfriend(s) against eachother.   I found out her gay friend was a boyfriend, and then it turned out she had another boyfriend also at the time, that he didn't know about. 

I remember her telling me ""I should be flattered it took two guys to replace me""  which was an odd thing to say considering she.. You know.. Cheated on me. 



Like all in the span of 3 or 4 days.  Like Sunday everything was normal just good ol casual sex I thought, and by Wednesday I was out almost a hundred dollars and found out there were also two other guys, one of which was a hundred dollars up.   

Which again, wouldn't have minded if she was honest because we weren't together and I had moved on to the ""casual sex with whoever"" stage of break up grief. 


Everything  after the break up and before that was in my top 10 sexual experiences, but everything afterwards was just.. You would get more pleasure out of humping a pillow.  Like I think that last time she was naked on the bed and I just went ""please leave, I don't want to do this at all""  and that turned into an argument because she wanted to be the one to say it to me. 


I really walked out of the whole thing feeling really dirty and gross.  

And because I have a kid I can never just wash my hands of her entirely."

What about a player of NMS that is a professional animator specifically in game design and development? 

>magining that it wouldn’t necessarily make the game worse delending on how it works.

It would objectively make the game worse.  Objectively.   It's not about realism, it's not about real life, it's about the mechanics as they exist within the game currently and how they work.  You're talking about a total ground up rebuild of the flight mechanics, which may or may not work out. 

Essentially to make a realitvely simple, and fun process, more complicated for no other reason than you....want to make a simple and fun gamey process.... Less fun and gamey. 


You wrote an entire screed about ""realism in video games doesn't translate to fun""  when your orginal example was full of games that did it the way they did it  *for realism*.    

By your own follow up point, and your own examples, it doesn't add anything to the experience.   


>Also, it could be an option. Then it’s not obligatory.


Now you're talking about doing an entire parallel rebuild of the flight mechanics, simply so that people can toggle between them.   Hundreds, if not thousands of total manhours for absolutely no reason, for a feature that quite honestly....  wouldn't be fun...and would be optional.    

Essentially you're arguing to shelve entire branches of development for absolutely no gain for the majority of players.       

It's bad game design, it's a bad idea, and it adds nothing to the game.    Objectively adds nothing to the game if it's optional.

 Oops.
