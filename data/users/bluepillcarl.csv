The real benefit of flying first class is the unlimited free booze, that's way more expensive than taking out 1 olive.  $40,000 is like at most 40-80 first class tickets or like 2-4 trips for the airline.  Seriously doubt the airline would really consider 40k over 1 oliveon everybody's salad.  If anything they could just tell the vendor to give them the olives at discount or threaten to switch vendors.  Switching peanuts for shitty pretzels in coach? Now that's some real cost savings."

worldnews,fd2c3fg,t3_ejv86a,1578145055.0,"Bill Gates is not the world's second richest person.  The world's richest people are in fact world leaders who have access to vast resources (oil and manufacturing) in places like China and the Middle East and Russia.  These people aren't just the richest but also much more powerful than people that are listed on Forbes as the world's richest people.  They're wealth cannot be quantified because it isn't documented sitting in one bank account or all based on one portfolio of a certain public equity.

One of the bigger problems isn't really who pays enough taxes but how tax revenues are utilized.  Should taxes be thrown at defense (war) or health care? Also a thought provoking issue is how funds are generally used to impact the world.  Is it better to solve economic problems in emerging economies or the developed world?  Is the world better off if there is access to clean water in sub-saharan Africa or Flint, Michigan?"
