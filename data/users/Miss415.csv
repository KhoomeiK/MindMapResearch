dogs,ff2dshu,t1_ff0jv6w,1579502038.0,"""No kill"" is extremely misleading because dogs are still euthanized. It means that no ""adoptable"" dog will be euthanized but aggressive or very sick dogs can be euthanized.  Most county shelters if not  all are ""open door"" shelters meaning they take any & every animal brought there.  The ones that call themselves no kill also euthanize or sub contract another shelter to do it for them. Most if not all ""no kill"" shelters do not take surrenders and if they do, the person surrendering goes through a screening process first."
dogs,ff2ddho,t1_ff26ipo,1579501594.0,">You can not speak for every shelter in the country so please tame your arrogance. Consider that a person's perspective is based on their personal experiences which may differ from yours.  That does not make them ignorant. ""Typical"" does not mean shit when you're talking about an individual dog."
dogs,felt6is,t3_epst3w,1579230318.0,"See if there's a professional dog walker in your area through Dog biz. They used to be called Dog tec and have a dog walking certification program that is excellent!  Full disclosure- I am a former student but the founder- Veronica Boutelle is the former director of the SF SPCA academy for dog trainers. Never ever use an app to find a dog pro! Dog biz has the Dog Walking Academy all over the U.S. and several countries abroad. You can use the link below to find a dog pro and navigate the website to research more about the qualifications of the walkers as well as Veronica.

(As long as you're willing to keep her and care for her in her senior dog years when she arthritic & loses her hearing) When you fall in love as you've described the only thing you will regret giving up is her! You are caring, wise & responsible for giving this such careful consideration. You sound well equipped & ready to take on the responsibility. You may need to give up some things you like to do but something tells me you won't regret it. If you plan on staying in the same place while you complete you education and feel confident that your living situation will be stable, you'll be a great dog mom!"
