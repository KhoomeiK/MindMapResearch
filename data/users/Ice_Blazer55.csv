Freeze:
Level: 2nd level enchantment
Range: 30ft
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting time: 1 Reaction
Classes: Druid, Wizard, Sorcerer 
When any creature within 30 feet of you attacks you can use your reaction to freeze them in place, they make a Con save on a failure they take 1d6 cold damage and immediately fail their attack, on a success they only take the 1d6 damage.
For every spell slot above level 2 the spell does another d6 damage"

Stone Bone:
Level: 5th level enchantment
Range: 30ft
Duration: Concentration up to 1 minuet / 10 rounds
Casting time: 1 Action

You turn one targets bones and skin as stiff and hard as stone on a failed Wisdom saving throw on a success nothing happens, rendering them paralysed, but because of the skin becoming as hard as stone they also become resistant to; piercing, slashing, bludgeoning and immunity to fire. You can end this anytime as a bonus action and each of the targets turn they can remake the saving throw."
