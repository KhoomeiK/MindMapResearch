Don't get me wrong: The USA is quite probably the highest developed nation in the world but it is also a quite unforgiving society, where the people at the fringes of society live in conditions below that what you would expect in a first world country. 

So, if you look at the raw numbers: Live expectancy in the USA stagnates (has fallen) while it still somewhat rises in Europe - and this is due to the lower life expectancies of the US american poor.

news,fdsgs6w,t1_fds2p7r,1578702435.0,"Let's ask the other way around: *What are the central & necessary dogmas?*

 *Religion:* the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods. 

While Animism very often goes hand in hand with polytheism and holds a position very near to pantheism (which in itself also fails this criteria) it has, in principle, no need for a personal god or gods. 

Most if not all religions have an implict hierarchy between gods and non-gods in which the rules of conduct are derived from the will of the gods.  In other words Animism ist the Anarchism to pantheisms communism in a world where polytheism is a god old feudal monarchy and monotheism is basically a fascist state.

*why it holds meaning:*

If the laws of the land are derived from religious laws they are by nature somewhat esoteric. You either are in the club and believe them or you lack the believe in the authority which installed these laws - than they might seem useless or crude. If they are derived by the ""will of society"" they are just an agreement between peers and thus open to anyone - all you need is to beleive that you have peers and a need to interact with them. Religion and a secular law will always be in conflict because the derived ethics don't match up - non-religious spiritual beliefs (like Animism and to an extend pantheism) don't generate this conflict and thus integrate very neatly into a secular society."
