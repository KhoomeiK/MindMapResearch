The moment in which the foul was called does not show up on a stat sheet."
CollegeBasketball,fevi90q,t1_fevhiv8,1579397718.0,They don't call that because it would have stopped momentum and they wouldn't dare do that with the game they were calling. It's a trend.
CollegeBasketball,fevhtn8,t1_fevhgnf,1579397637.0,"That's always what people say with the numbers, but the plays that mattered weren't called correctly. Tre got fouled at least 3 times in the final 3 minutes and they didn't even try and raise their whistle. I saw a ref put a whistle near his mouth before a Duke player even got close to defending a player and they blew their whistle before he fouled. That was around 2 and a half min left."

Get out of here. You won and you know why you won."

CollegeBasketball,fevh4f3,t1_fevgygl,1579397360.0,"When players get tossed around and thrown to the ground without a call for 3 possessions in a row, it's ridiculous. They called the same foul the other way. Tre jones got slapped 2 times in the final minute, not even a flinch by the refs."

pokemon,fe6iik3,t3_envu96,1578891977.0,"I mean, I think it's so when kids play the game, they can  relate. It's like Harry Potter when you get that letter to attend Hogwarts. It's like the Jedi temple, you only get to start there at such a young age. Sometimes, these video games mean a lot more to kids than they do adults, as is the criticism for the game. There are some dedicated people wanting certain aspects of previous games to return, but at some point you need to realise that these games were always going to have a certain age range where they would be applied to and still can succeed without over doing it. The newest common complaint makes me wonder why people want this game to become something so complex that it basically shuts out any chance of a child simply wanting to play the game and making them grind endlessly when, as a kid, they have no business doing so. If there was an easy way to make an adult pokemon and child pokemon game separately, it would have been done by now. I think it's time to put to rest the idea of Pokemon ever becoming something the diehard fans want."

Social media has given so many a platform to share, and sadly, the most popular controversies are caused by bots and are causing division and hatred. People angrily react to those things are becoming so easily triggered over lies. Facts are becoming fiction because so many have been told that by posts that aren't even factual.

He is abusing his power and getting away with it. He is further instilling this in anyone who has power that they can abuse it and basically do what they want without any punishment, and the people beside them help to reinforce this awful bullshit. It's funny how so many of these fucked up people in this country say ""why don't you just leave the US then?"". If they stay and the decent people leave, this country would eventually just be abandoned to the ultra corrupt and it will become the opposite of what we created it to be. We're headed in the wrong direction, and there are so many ignorant people out there that think we're climbing higher than ever.

Even when the 2d sprites were still thriving, they had a chance to expand to a console and make an unbelievable expanded world game, but they didn't. The market thrived on nostalgia kicks. There was a slow period right before PoGo and Sun and Moon came out where I thought pokemon would die out, but PoGo especially brought people back that didn't play past gen 1 or gen 2, and now they were having nostalgia overload. GF saw that success from Niantic and decided to do just the same with their games.

The nostalgia of pokemon is what is keeping a lot of people around, and it pains them to even consider ditching a series they grew up with.

If you want change for the better, it won't happen unless the people with the right mindset get into the game developing scene. Otherwise, it's big name companies with lots of money that are going to keep trying to make lots of money, not please their dedicated fans. The smaller developers are more personal and appreciative of their fans because they matter to them. They are the life line.

You can refuse to buy it and call it a scam, but in the end, they will continue to grow the game. $30 pays for something we will get today, June, and the fall. That's much better than $60 more a year later when an ultra game could have been the outcome. I see it with a lot of people who say ""I've played every game"" and their displeasure. Maybe you made the mistake of trusting a gaming company too much to make something perfect for you. They were never going to do that. They've been doing what plenty of other companies have done, but because you invested so much money, you want more back than what they give. That's life. You live and learn."
