StardewValley,ff8jjl6,t1_fb9jlvh,1579681451.0,"The item id number glitch still works on pc, however caviar doesn’t have an Id since it’s an artisan good"
StardewValley,ff8jisk,t1_fb9hpiw,1579681420.0,It’s still available on pc

dogs,ff46h96,t1_ff3861o,1579556595.0,"I’m not saying that she wasn’t taken care of, I was commenting on how you thought that was funny. Is it always funny to you when dogs hurt themselves?"
dogs,ff46dh7,t1_ff2mxh3,1579556529.0,"I never said it definitely did, I just said that it could have. This dog really seemed to hate people so it would take any chance to get away. It likely starved."
dogs,ff2jfbg,t1_ff22jea,1579508850.0,How? Do you think it’s funny that the dog cut itself and probably died soon after running away? Or did you not mean it in that way?
StardewValley,fekpywc,t1_fekjh43,1579205197.0,Thanks! I thought that meant there was damage to my farm lol
StardewValley,fekj97d,t1_fejgrvw,1579201198.0,"Yeah, someone recommended fishing to earn early money and I’ve been working on that since, earning thousands."

StardewValley,fejf3n2,t1_fejepr6,1579171099.0,Thanks
StardewValley,fejees5,t1_feje7pf,1579170050.0,"I find they take up a lot of space though for so little. I mean, only the four tiles adjacent? And for a copper and iron bar? Bit of a ripoff if you ask me
Does upgrading the watering can help?"
StardewValley,feje0m4,t1_fejdoy7,1579169458.0,I have tried both of those. The only reason I struggle to farm is because if I water just for 1 day it takes a very long time and a lot of the energy I have.
StardewValley,fejdyph,t1_fejdox5,1579169377.0,"I have plenty of ore and crystals, just no money to spend with them to upgrade stuff"

memes,fd1nryd,t1_fd1gbhj,1578133955.0,"Do you know how swimming works? People trash about and try to push themselves up as long as they can, and when someone thrashes about it’s extremely easy to see them"
memes,fd1nh24,t1_fd1ltzu,1578133818.0,What if someone didn’t take a video. Also there are plenty of men who have been jailed for false accusations of rape even if there was evidence. People tend to believe women more it’s just a fact we have to accept

dankmemes,fc2smrp,t1_fc2rxys,1577372859.0,It’s obviously not in the 1900’s but it was still technically the final year of the millennium
dankmemes,fc2j94h,t1_fc2j7dc,1577363118.0,Well I guess it can be either next year or 2021 depending on where you live
dankmemes,fc2j71x,t1_fc2hfo1,1577363037.0,What?
dankmemes,fc2j4bz,t1_fc2hei8,1577362928.0,"There was no year 0, 2020 will be the last year of the decade, but not the start of a new decade. Technically, both of them are correct, but it’s based on where you live. It sounds like you need to [search it up](https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/decade.html)"

dogs,fc1n1da,t1_fc1my5w,1577323690.0,"I had a feeling that would be the case. I guess he just doesn’t like me, there’s nothing I can really do"
dogs,fc1mzcx,t1_fc1mvq8,1577323643.0,"Yes, I’ve also given him big lamb bones with meat on them, nothing really works. He might just not like me no matter what I do"
dogs,fc1mwg3,t1_fc1lx18,1577323572.0,It’s not really a strong dislike either though it’s just a “you don’t like me I don’t like you” dislike
dogs,fc1m6vx,t1_fc1lubq,1577322956.0,"I have, it didn’t work"
dogs,fc1m5rf,t1_fc1lx18,1577322927.0,"He was like this before, I’m starting to dislike him because he’s like this. He was actually my favourite dog"
