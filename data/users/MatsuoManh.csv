AmItheAsshole,ff9efbx,t3_esaqsf,1579711232.0,"Dual Diagnosis:

YTA for ranking the relationships between your Aunt & GF

NAH for not realizing the relationship w/ your Aunt & GF are truly not comparable

These are two relationships cannot be compared to each other; and it is impossible to rank them. In other words a GF, can never be compared to a Mother or Aunt in your case. Your relationship relationship is completely different based on their role in your life. Each has a different meaning to your life, and really the phases of life.

IMO your GF is #1, which does not take away from your relationship with your Aunt or any other person. IT IS your #1 romantic involvement."

However, I really like using FP's. A degree of personalization that is unattainable w/ digital means. Although, there was a move afoot to create custom cursive  digital fonts based on a persons hand writing. I usually have 6 or 8 FP's inked up at a given time. Thanks for bringing this topic up!"

Dad simply did his job as store manager - to protect the company assets. He in fact had no choice in his actions dealing with stealing from the store. It is his moral and legal obligation to uphold the stores policies. To not do so, puts his livelihood in danger. It seems the apple didn't fall far from the tree, since her mom wanted your dad to cover up the theft.
