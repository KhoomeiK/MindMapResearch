TheRightCantMeme,ffegopj,t3_eszzwj,1579847305.0,I don't know where these people live that has such cheap rent. I live in the middle of fucking nowhere and the cheapest apartments around me are 1k a month.
PixelArt,ffctf69,t1_ffbomyi,1579806892.0,I played the demo for Backbone and it was great. Beautiful game with an interesting story. Can't wait until it comes out.
pcmasterrace,ffcoydz,t3_estuul,1579804106.0,It would be so weird for him to not be around anymore. I built my first computer watching one of his tutorials years ago and he was a major influence on my interest in computers.
Instagramreality,ffbk8h8,t3_esnrjk,1579769273.0,Yeah but who are these people that just sit around watching some lady eat a pizza.
MurderedByWords,ffbj9ym,t3_eslf2e,1579767923.0,The second the government saved a business from failing was the day capitalism died. It was a fun experiment but it's time to move on like the rest of the world.
modernwarfare,ff9nizi,t1_ff8to1r,1579716710.0,It's like watching a group of people who have never played a video game before. They didn't even try and move or dodge they just stood there and took it.
iamverybadass,ff8k9ko,t3_erz54v,1579682484.0,I'm sure everyone else at the gym appreciates him sack tapping the bar like it was his cousins chin.
trashy,ff8j1tb,t3_es06zv,1579680759.0,Guy needs to make copies and post it all over the office.
TopMindsOfReddit,ff4lg7u,t3_erhl71,1579566471.0,"Even if he was a republican, which as OP stated most evidence supports the opposite, Republican doesn't equal liking Trump. You can be a republican and think the guy is an idiot. Even football fans aren't this loyal to their team."
Tinder,ff3j1ld,t3_erco7r,1579542095.0,What a charming person. I bet he gets laid constantly with a personality like that.
nottheonion,ff1czpi,t1_ff0pdcj,1579477593.0,Kind of clever idea actually. Maybe he even anticipated he was going to get caught and stashed the money somewhere for later.
starterpacks,fezq8ck,t3_eqxjk1,1579460281.0,Granted most people don't know how to read signs.
gaming,fex6rp9,t3_eqsylp,1579425527.0,I bought one when it was on sale for basically nothing. I have yet to use it and really just bought it more as a novelty. Something to look at in 10 years and remind myself valve made a weird pc controller one time.
pcmasterrace,fetf782,t3_eqfpq1,1579374835.0,Mine is on the way and should be delivered tomorrow. It's a big responsibility but I'm ready.

MapPorn,fepdqrv,t3_eq52ce,1579317995.0,As a Georgian I can confirm I hate Florida. Place is a shithole where old people go to die on a budget.
rareinsults,feljars,t1_fekt5ew,1579223533.0,If I lose any more hair I think I'll just go with the Jason Statham look and cut it really short and get really jacked to compensate.
coaxedintoasnafu,fekmcfv,t3_epjgqm,1579203038.0,/r/ChoosingBeggars has some of the cringiest obviously fake posts and I don't know why people fall for their bullshit. I wish they handled it like /r/insaneparents and have a voting system to say if it's fake or not.
TheRightCantMeme,fekfyot,t1_fejn6bj,1579199235.0,"Some of them legitimately would. My aunt for example would have no issue if he completely took over and ruled forever. She's also one of the people who say there's going to be a revolution if he gets kicked out of office. She used to be a pretty rational and normal person, but she's just been completely brainwashed."

OldSchoolCool,fefv70r,t1_fefqm8r,1579066249.0,It's really well done plastic surgery if it is. Her face has barely changed since she was young.
OldSchoolCool,fefnukc,t1_fef7qmw,1579060430.0,Joan Jett has aged amazingly gracefully. She seriously doesn't look a day over 40. Something about punk rock makes people ageless.
mildlyinteresting,fecvv21,t3_eoaufz,1578986668.0,That's an expensive yet effective business card
Damnthatsinteresting,fect1hd,t1_febzyrl,1578983497.0,"My dramatic theory is that the rifle was owned by cattle ranchers. They where driving a herd through the desert, stopped to camp and left the rifle there. They got up early and continued on their path. Some guy felt like he was forgetting something the whole time. Turns out he left his rifle back at camp, but they already did a whole day of riding and he couldn't leave his partner with the cattle by himself. He decides to just leave it and told himself he would go back for it one day, time goes by and he forgets about it completely."
thisismylifenow,feb41n6,t3_eo0gjk,1578955256.0,Not an expert but don't most of these places have electronic keycards that let you in and out of the building?
ToiletPaperUSA,feafejl,t1_fe8ygd2,1578948031.0,"I do the same thing with my girlfriend all the time, but I also don't tweet it out and word it in such a way that makes me sound like Hannibal Lecter."
CrappyDesign,fe6nkzu,t3_envvvs,1578897149.0,It looks like they could just chop off some of the balcony thing and it would be fine. What a strange thing to fuck up.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fe6c5f6,t1_fe5wlnc,1578886688.0,I'm sure in a couple of weeks the entire state is going to freeze over.
gaming,fe6b4f1,t3_entn25,1578885932.0,She was always my favorite follower in New Vegas. I always appreciated her sassy and cynical view of the world.
MurderedByWords,fe5ym0b,t1_fe5oi25,1578877845.0,"I don't trust Biden but I think he's going to end up in the top two at least because he's the ""safe bet"". My assumption it'll end up being between Warren and Biden. I hope Bernie makes it though, I don't necessarily agree with all of his policies but I think democrats need someone aggressive to shake things up, and so far he seems like the only candidate capable of doing that."
me_irl,fe5baa6,t1_fe50adg,1578867290.0,I'm planning on sending a screenshot of my comment to Billie Eilish on Twitter in hopes that she finally recognizes me and stops blocking all of my alt accounts.
me_irl,fe4xs6s,t1_fe3um4b,1578863844.0,I'm glad I'm not the only weirdo who immediately recognized that logo.
greentext,fe3t2ce,t3_enl474,1578852637.0,Maybe I'm just getting old but I don't understand what the deal with her is. She just looks like every other Instagram thot out there.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fe0ezvh,t3_enhni1,1578812247.0,But it's a large multi billion dollar corporation giving free stuff away to millionaires sooooo
ToiletPaperUSA,fe003bk,t3_en9pxb,1578799859.0,Why do ultra conservatives hate this girl so much. Like she just made a speech telling people to stop fucking up the environment. Why is that possibility something to be upset about.
nextfuckinglevel,fdzql3b,t3_enddmz,1578793519.0,I really need one of those racing wheels. Seems like it would be so much fun.
todayilearned,fdytjqp,t3_encb8o,1578783428.0,I honestly don't get how the guy isn't immune to the stuff by now. He must use some incredibly strong strains.
StarWars,fduei3f,t1_fdu7c2t,1578731907.0,I think /r/PrequelMemes has gone beyond satire at this point and turned into legitimate cult fandom. Going on that sub is like witnessing virtual Stockholm syndrome.
quityourbullshit,fducn10,t3_emw2l3,1578731233.0,"I don't think this kid knows what server means either. I don't know much about the internal workings of 360s but I assume like all consoles, they're just PCs running proprietary bios and software. You may be able to flash one to get it to run some kind of OS and run server software but I don't know why you would do this because alone it's not a particularly capable system, and it wouldn't be worth the effort. Plus in this context it makes absolutely no sense for a server to even be involved. 

I'm no minecraft expert but you could likely do this with a laptop, an arduino, and some basic Java skills. Honestly it sounds like it would be an interesting project and I think the kid should try and legitimately learn how to do it rather than faking it."
StarWars,fdu3w9l,t1_fdtzrx8,1578727090.0,"Because it's meta and ""cool"" to defend the honor of the prequels. episode 1 is really the only one I can voluntarily sit through, but it's still objectively bad. 2 and 3 are still some of the worst movies in the entire franchise, and I'll go as far as to say some of the worst movies I've ever seen in general. Ewan McGregor pretty much exclusively held those movies together."
StarWars,fdtse2h,t1_fdtdawl,1578721460.0,Even watching it as a kid I thought the horns looked comically horrible...granted most of the movie was comically horrible though.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdpmxwc,t3_emitut,1578633224.0,Why do celebrities always have the shittiest tattoos
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdoaqii,t3_emat49,1578601811.0,"I don't understand what the point of this is, he's just embarrassing himself. Everyone knows it's an act."
mechanical_gifs,fdkj9j9,t3_elrtor,1578504883.0,"I kind of want one honestly. My first phone was a razr, it would be neat to come full circle."
MurderedByWords,fdeac31,t1_fddjibf,1578334665.0,I think no matter your political views most people don't *want* to go to war. Trump is just an old warhawk that insists we bomb everything in existence because he's too old and fat to directly face the consequences of his actions. He's not the one being sent to the front lines so he could care less about starting another war.
Cringetopia,fde7l5c,t3_ekt3dc,1578332926.0,This man has been disappointing his dad for longer than most of us have been alive and I think we should show some respect.
todayilearned,fdd86pw,t1_fdd7vdo,1578299202.0,You seem quite upset my dude. Maybe you should take a nap or something.
JustBootThings,fdd055x,t3_ekjbto,1578289635.0,Those decorations are cute. I wonder if he made that heart all by himself.
pics,fdciac3,t1_fdc2i4i,1578275588.0,"This is reddit, there are no jokes and everybody is upset at everything all the time."
awfuleverything,fdbz3zq,t1_fdajb0q,1578264092.0,My step mom was a heavy collector of them. She was one of those that believed they would be worth a fortune and a good investment. I think she has yet to make a dime on any of them.
todayilearned,fdb9r2i,t1_fdb2dyy,1578255234.0,Frick off.
todayilearned,fdah4fr,t1_fdabkq7,1578246071.0,"It also adds nothing to the conversation and is overall a useless statement. Which makes it far more cunty than my fuck off, which is why I'm standing by my statement that he can fuck off."
Justfuckmyshitup,fd7lb3n,t1_fd5hi7d,1578206245.0,"It seems like they're significantly longer than the rest of his hair too, so it's like he consciously has grown out those hairs alone as a fashion choice."
todayilearned,fd7eanv,t1_fd7dxxv,1578203123.0,Fuck off.
todayilearned,fd6vto2,t1_fd6umqv,1578196365.0,I didn't see the part about the stolen car. Maybe the dude just is a psycho with a weird fixation for cops then.
pics,fd6t5ad,t1_fd5k8s5,1578195389.0,"Damn, I didn't know it was the same one. I figured he just had a stockpile of copies or something. That's pretty impressive."
todayilearned,fd6sqni,t1_fd6mniy,1578195249.0,That's what's confusing to me. At 14 they likely would have given him somewhat of a pass sense he's a kid. He probably still could have gotten in. The fact that he continued to do it years later when he was old enough to be eligible is what doesn't make sense to me. Maybe there's some kind of mental problems there and that's why he can't get in.
fightporn,fd0wemp,t1_fd04wyt,1578124675.0,I had to watch it back several times just because I was so fascinated how they managed to have all of the furniture and stuff in proportion.
news,fcyt9i7,t3_ejiqi1,1578086595.0,This stupid conflict has been going on since before I was born and every time they find some new excuse to start it back up again. The whole thing is nothing but a dick measuring contest between egotistical politicians and people are dying for it. Such a waste.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fcwvtln,t3_ej9txh,1578039733.0,What is with all of the world leaders being bumbling idiots lately. It's like they all lost their brain cells at the same time.
holdmyfeedingtube,fcwtlub,t3_ej5vn7,1578037094.0,Got some pretty decent velocity going there.
PublicFreakout,fcwckne,t3_ej1uru,1578022272.0,What could be so urgent?
creepy,fcwcfh3,t3_ej4mwu,1578022177.0,Why would they give it eyes? That seems like a terrible decision.
pcmasterrace,fcto7w1,t1_fcsq70z,1577951153.0,"I don't think I'll ever be done with mine. First built it in 2015 for 800 bucks with super budget nearly obsolete parts. It's not even the same machine anymore, I think the only thing that survived so far is the hard drive. It's already becoming outdated again and needs more upgrades. It's like a never ending cycle of poverty."
whitepeoplegifs,fcroiwx,t1_fcqoocr,1577904513.0,That was my first thought too. Do a quick jog and think bad thoughts.
sadcringe,fcoe99h,t1_fcoc5cn,1577830116.0,"When I was younger i used to trade all of my games in for new ones. Wasn't until the past couple of years I started keeping and collecting games I buy/ buying games I used to own. Most people still seem to do the same thing, if they buy physical copies at all."
sadcringe,fcob6xl,t1_fco2eeo,1577827975.0,That was my thinking. It's an old game at this point. Most people don't hang onto games very long. Very possible she just played it and traded it in. Doesn't necessarily need some dramatic sad backstory.
HumansAreMetal,fcoamm5,t1_fcnlg4i,1577827587.0,Pretty good form though.
ToiletPaperUSA,fckqooi,t1_fckai9f,1577731115.0,I don't think I've ever seen him without a shrunken face so I'm going to assume that's what he actually looks like.
NotHowGirlsWork,fci0w2i,t1_fcgpnu8,1577656431.0,Even in a men's bathroom this doesn't happen. In all my years of using public bathrooms I have never witnessed another dude walking around with his meat out.
iamverybadass,fchxvmg,t1_fch05ho,1577655411.0,I wrote terrible poetry as well. One time in high school I wrote a poem about a girl I had a crush on and I let her read it and she grimaced at it. Still a wonderful memory that I enjoy reflecting on during late nights.
rareinsults,fcd9gsl,t1_fcbsz5w,1577607894.0,I'm curious if they tattooed the under boob as well.
im14andthisisdeep,fcclbo1,t1_fcb9lux,1577599721.0,The silhouette doesn't even line up either. It's like it was made by someone with decent talent but terrible ideas.
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fc62ty8,t1_fc5ay5a,1577471002.0,My assumption is he couldn't see because of the mask and just started blindly sprinting.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fc3xkuk,t1_fc3gu23,1577401219.0,His fans are some of the most toxic people ever. If you even hint that you don't like him 50 of them will come out of nowhere skittering around like Gollum talking about how precious and perfect he was.
DemocraticSocialism,fc3boi1,t1_fc2ypzc,1577386243.0,"That's my thing. I get the whole ""eat the rich"" thing but it's not like he just has that money sitting in his bank account. Most of it is probably in his company or other assets, money he probably doesn't even have direct access to. Plus Bill Gates is absolutely the lesser of all evils here. The guy has donated billions to charity and invests tons of his time and money into making the world a better place. Out of all the shitty super rich in the world I feel like he's the last one people should be attacking."
holdmycosmo,fbzc6g7,t1_fbyhw02,1577241836.0,Ehh I mean the lady could very well be a security guard/loss prevention and its her job to stop thieves.
