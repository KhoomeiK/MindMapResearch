aww,ferdb8s,t1_fer0z5l,1579352593.0,"Dogs know stuff. I lived with a dude who owned a dog with an inoperable tumor on his belly. He waited and waited for the right time to the dog put down. See, every day when my friend would get home from work the dog would greet him with a wagging tail, but the day he decided to take the dog to the vet, he hid himself under the house. Sad day."
