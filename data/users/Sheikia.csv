Chempros,ffgth81,t1_ffgry2q,1579914641.0,Well the standards are set in solvents. So the standard for 195Pt nmr is sodium hexachloroplatinate 1.2 M in D20. This is for setting up the nmr experiments on the instrument.
Chempros,ffgk9b5,t1_ffgdq8t,1579908163.0,"This is for the NMR facility manager to set up the experiments (including decoupling and inept and stuff) on the machines though, not just for one sample.  So I think it's probably best if we stick to the traditional standard."

Standup,ff2cwll,t1_ff28h7d,1579501103.0,"My favourite joke I heard him say was:

 ""I lost my grandparents in the holocaust ( slight pause) museum""

It's so brilliant because it plays on the audiences expectations that every joke he has is dark. And he just throws it away. 

But I've also seen him on podcasts where he slightly slips from his persona and he seems like a genuinely nice guy. He's just also  incredibly sharp. He might not always hit his jokes, but I think we need people like him pushing boundaries and coming up with new ideas."
papermario,fezq802,t3_eqmrrl,1579460278.0,I'm not sure I believe this. The end of the year is not enough time to build an RPG of the caliber of Paper Mario or TTYD. The stories are generally long and there is lots of humor and dialog and there is no way that this has been being worked on long enough to provide that.
Chempros,fee7yeh,t1_fee30yw,1579028261.0,Thanks! I have used it as an antisolvent before and I really like it. Unfortunately it does tend to make things more oily which is something I'm trying to avoid Haha. But it's worth a try in this case
Chempros,feclg05,t1_fecio6y,1578976822.0,Yeah I'm not so concerned about that. I've helped and watched people in my lab model disorder from pretty much every solvent.
Chempros,fechxgj,t1_fecgz6o,1578974335.0,"It's an actinide alkyl cation with a spectator ligand. The anion is (R)BCF.

I definitely think I'm going to try DCM! Thanks for the advice"
Chempros,fecf565,t1_fece3gt,1578972436.0,It's a cation with an open coordination site so THF will coordinate
Chempros,fecaiic,t1_febnhwq,1578969605.0,Also interesting that you find BArF20 salts more crystalline than BArF24. Myself as well as everyone in my lab have found the exact opposite haha
Chempros,fec9wj5,t1_febjlwi,1578969266.0,Good ones. Even the bonding in actinide complexes isn't fully understood. Especially not the transuranics
Chempros,fec9f9d,t1_fec7abx,1578969004.0,"Sure. I have an actinide alkyl complex with a spectator ligand. I dissolve that and BCF in separate vials in either bromobenzene or toluene (bromobenzene is better because its soluble, toluene the reaction takes forever). Add the BCF to the metal complex dropwise at RT. The product oils out in toluene, produces a yellow solution in bromobenzene. There's no by product so no workup."
Chempros,fec8rgf,t1_fec2cvs,1578968642.0,Yeah I might try ether. I'm pretty sure it's not an oil because of solvent trapped in the lattice but instead because it's an ion pair. But either may work.
Chempros,fec7p1e,t1_feblxqi,1578968087.0,My compounds are pretty sensitive to proton sources so I'm pretty sure it would go to shit in MeOH. Either that or it'll make the alkoxide complex Haha  Thanks though!!
Chempros,fec7884,t1_febnn41,1578967847.0,Ah thanks that's helpful. Might have to figure out how to make it BARF anion
Chempros,fec70w2,t1_febnhwq,1578967741.0,"Yeah all my successful in pairs that I've crystallized have been with BARF anions. But how can I swap the counter anion to be BARF? I was think I could react my alkyl complex with like trityl barf maybe? Not sure it'll work though.

Edit: to be clear I'm abstracting an alkyl group with BCF. So I'd instead react the alkyl precursor with trityl BARF. Not sure if that would work though. I know with BCF often times it's a contact pair so maybe that's essential to the stability of the complex?"
Chempros,fec6ryu,t1_fec4x1w,1578967610.0,Thanks I might try that. I think I'll have to dry some though. I only care about the cation! So I could definitely swap out the anion
Chempros,feaef9m,t1_feae2s9,1578947660.0,I could try DCM or chloroform but this work is being done in a glovebox and those solvents are usually banned from gloveboxes. However my supervisor will sometimes allow small amounts in for specific reasons. I could try that
Chempros,feaaxnd,t1_fea5co8,1578946439.0,yeah if I could swap it out for tetraphenyl borate but I'm not sure what the driving force of the anion swap would be. They are very similar anions so I don't think I could drive one of them out of solution.  I can't use water lol it's an actinide cation super duper moisture sensitive.
Chempros,feaakjf,t1_fea1oez,1578946316.0,I need single crystal xray. I don't think powder diffraction will do it. It's a structural characterization and I need accurate bond lengths.
Chempros,fe9sqnw,t1_fe9pbg8,1578941151.0,Yeah the only ones that I've had luck with have been with BARF. This one is BCF extracting an R group so it's not symmetric. I was thinking I could try to swap out the anion maybe. Or maybe just add Brookhart's acid to protonate off the group instead.
Chempros,fe9q6g6,t1_fe9n6uc,1578940460.0,"Yeah I've tried all of this at both RT and at -35 C. No dice, it still oils."
Chempros,fe9pi9t,t3_ens64d,1578940336.0,"I really like the Kugelrohr. Vacuum distillation made simple. 

As far as equipment/techniques go, prep-TLC is my favourite because its so simple and kind of low-rent haha. You just scrape off your product."
Chempros,fe9m4gk,t1_fe9lnkl,1578939359.0,"Yep, no luck. It's already not at all soluble in toluene and it's so soluble in bromobenzene that it doesn't come out. If I do a very small amount of bromobenzene in heptane it oils out eventually."
Chempros,fe3oy2c,t3_eni6gb,1578851469.0,"I think there might have been some steps that were confused or lost in translation over time. The steps that would make sense to me if there were water-soluble metal impurities to remove would be:

1. Add water to pigment and leave to settle for an afternoon (I don't think the sun has any affect at this point, just the time to let the pigment settle)
2. Pour off the water and discard the water as waste
3. Set in the sun to dry out the pigment

Again, I'm not sure what impurities you would be removing, but if there were water-soluble impurities this would help get rid of them."
Chempros,fe3nu53,t1_fe2u002,1578851176.0,They said that they decant the water off so really they are doing a wash with water. I don't think the sun is relevant as much as just leaving it to settle to decant easier. If there are water-soluble metal impurities then this would get rid of some of them.

tifu,fdr18ut,t1_fdqhfgo,1578678112.0,"Yeah at least 12 times. I do get a bit of a nice effect, like, if I have a headache it will go away. But I don't really feel high."
tifu,fdr12sa,t1_fdq3tps,1578678013.0,"Well, I'm in Canada and I bought it from a store so it's definitely real."
tifu,fdq04ym,t1_fdprmr9,1578648281.0,"Ok I am this person. I've smoked and smoked to almost no effect. Can someone explain to me what I'm doing wrong? I fully inhale into my mouth and then ""downwards"" into my chest and hold it. I've coughed and coughed because I've held the smoke in my lungs. I get a full billow of smoke coming out when I exhale. I honestly don't know how to breathe it in any differently?

Edit: also I am a singer and definitely  know how to breathe with my diaphragm so I'm not just shallowly inhaling with my mouth"
funny,fdjcgm7,t1_fdjahfm,1578465227.0,"Omg I would kill to have an app that I can check from my phone whether I turned off the stove. I'm such an anxious person I've literally had to come all the way home from work to just check my stove or else I would go crazy. It's always off, but it still gets me everytime. One to check if I locked my door too would be nice."

Lethbridge,fdhewc8,t3_el81ih,1578421188.0,"Plum is expensive but doesn't really have a closing hour; as long as there are still people in there, they are open. The downside to that though is if no one shows up they close early."
FanTheories,fdh6q38,t1_fdh2ag7,1578416568.0,Yes. There have been zabrak mandalorians.
zelda,fdflswt,t1_fdf4l4k,1578364672.0,"I found that being able to solve the dungeons in any order made the puzzles very easy and repetitive. Normally, when you have a linear story, you can combine items to solve puzzles. Because you could do them in any order in ALBW, every puzzle had to be solved using only the one item. It kind of made it so that you basically went into each room and said, ok so in what direction do I use this item to solve the puzzle."
facepalm,fcvejx4,t1_fcv9yad,1578000448.0,"Well, I'd argue you can't accidentally use the scientific method. It has to be somewhat intentional. But, yes, if they have a hypothesis and test that hypothesis while observing proper controls and analyzing the data, they are performing science. In the same way that someone that bakes a cake is a baker. However, it's obvious the person meant someone who does science as a job, which I addressed further down the comment chain."
facepalm,fcuubmb,t1_fcuts7v,1577988661.0,Agreed. Sorry to get pedantic but I don't like it when people gatekeep science. It demotivates people to do research and engage in the scientific method when people insist you must have a PhD in order to be of value to science. There are plenty of other ways to contribute to the scientific community without a PhD. Including being a scientific communicator.
facepalm,fcutlvs,t1_fcussix,1577988240.0,That's not true. If I publish a research paper in my undergrad am I not a scientist?
facepalm,fcurhrz,t1_fcuqouq,1577987013.0,"You don't have to have a PhD to be a scientist. Anyone that follows the scientific method is a scientist if you want to get pedantic. Or, more likely, you mean someone who pursues science as a career, but you definitely still don't need a PhD to do that."
MadeMeSmile,fchotul,t1_fch22ya,1577652563.0,"Just FYI, suddenly becoming very religious and preachy when it is completely out of character and shutting yourself away from loved ones can be a symptom of burgeoning mental health disorders such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. When treated, those ideologies often go away and the person returns to normal. (Well, closer to normal, these diseases cannot be cured) Unfortunately, people experiencing this are very succeptible to manipulation by others and often don't get treatment because of it."
facepalm,fchnukh,t3_eh9mr0,1577652194.0,"Um she definitely did run for office and was in charge. She was a senator for 8 years and the Secretary of State. Yes, she wasn't the president, but she is a very successful politician. Where's the facepalm?"
movies,fch5imi,t1_fcgpe35,1577647456.0,"Definitely. If you go into the movie knowing and already accepting the concept of the musical Cats, it's a pretty faithful adaptation with some questionable CGI choices. It's only the worst movie you've ever seen if you have no idea what you are getting yourself into. As a fan of musicals, but not a fan of the musical Cats, I thought it was only ok, not the second coming of Hitler."
