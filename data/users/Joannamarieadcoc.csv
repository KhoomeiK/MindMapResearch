aww,feev8it,t1_feeuuhp,1579041943.0,She is I and I 1) know I have a weight problem.  2) am actively working on reducing it not because of the way I look because I'm bomb as is but because I want to live a long life and 3) yes am currently happy. Sorry I am not going to crawl into a hole and cry my days away because of some weight.  That would be counterproductive.
aww,feeujxk,t1_feeublt,1579041522.0,Well duh. Lol you think that we don't realize we need to lose weight in order to be our healthier selves. Lol. It's currently something I am working on getting under control because I don't want to die young.  Doesn't mean I am going to stop being happy while I am at it. Silly.
