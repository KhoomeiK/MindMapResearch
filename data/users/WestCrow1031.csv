dogs,fckcebp,t1_fckbr3m,1577722172.0,I'm really sorry about your loss as well. All we can do is honor them in knowing that we gave them their best life.

dogs,fcjlixn,t3_ehf4hk,1577692593.0,"Stay strong OP, Loki loved you greatly and you loved Loki. Cherish your time with him and do whatever it takes try come to peace with it. I had to do the hardest thing I've ever had to do today to my best friend, Gunner. All you can do is honor Loki and keep in mind that you gave him the best life you could. That's something to be proud of. Its what keeps me from breaking down at the very moment."
dogs,fcjkocr,t3_ehggi8,1577691504.0,"I had to say goodbye to my best friend (11 y/o black lab) today. He showed signs of renal failure and was at the end of the tunnel. He just seemed fatigued Friday, but Saturday is when he really took a turn for the worse. He and I did everything together-- I got him when I was 10. It was/is Sunday so all the vets near me are closed and I couldn't stand to see him suffer any more. He knew I loved him and I know that he loved me. He was my bird hunting companion for many years and he loved every minute of it. He worked all his life for me, so I owed it to him to be strong and do what had to be done, for his sake. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do because he was the first dog I've ever had-- not to mention my best friend. He laid down and didn't want to walk anymore. I pet him and let him know how much he meant to me. We laid there at the edge of the creek for what seemed like hours, all the while I'm building the strength to save my buddy from his pain. He never felt it when it happened. Not a twitch came from his body when I pulled the trigger. 

I know saying goodbye is not easy. OP, your dog loves you and knows you love him. Reenforce that you love him. Hold his paw, look him in the eyes, give him his favorite scratch, talk to him, give him his favorite treat. Do whatever it takes to make sure he knows that you love him and are putting him down for his best interest- not because you're tired of, or find him inconvenient. 

Get him a headstone, take a sample of his hair, take pictures, do whatever it takes for YOU to accept what is happening. You must remember that your buddy is only around for a portion of your life, but to him, you are his whole life. All you can do is do your best to honor him and keep in your mind that you gave him an excellent life that he enjoyed all the way through.

I'm sorry you have to go through this. I really wish nobody had to. Be strong OP. You can always message me if you need someone to talk to."

relationships,f2nrzl7,t1_f2nq9ps,1570319120.0,"Thank you. I genuinely love this girl and can completely see me having a future with her. She's my best friend. It has just been extremely hard to talk to here lately because any time I would ask her how she's doing, she says she just needs space. I really just think school has been wearing her down too-- Pre-Vet isn't easy."
