technology,febmx96,t1_feaegeh,1578960575.0,"They could easily sell service with Gigabit speeds but limit bandwidth during peak periods or just say it's not guaranteed.

Since about 80% of traffic is video on an adaptive bitrate stream, it's more practical than ever to sell service with a maximum bandwidth that isn't always available to the consumer. 

They could sell upgrades which affect how you're prioritized, or take a page out of T-Mobile's playbook and throttle video to a certain speed unless you pay more.

science,fdkoc4j,t1_fdkhvoz,1578507752.0,"Agreed. The rest of their story seems legit, but the out of pocket max is almost certainly lower than they portrayed it to be. Doesn't change the fact that our health insurance system is a hot mess."
science,fdkncly,t1_fdjmcnh,1578507155.0,"Nah, bro. COBRA coverage is group coverage, but if you're younger and/or healthier than the median of that group, you're underwriting them to an extent. That's perfectly OK in an employer sponsored group plan since the costs are shared by all employees, subsidized to some extent by the employer, and generally everything is tax deductible. It's also typically high-quality insurance, which again is great as long as your employer is paying a big part of it. 

[COBRA is the full cost of coverage,](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insurance/11/intro-cobra-health-insurance.asp) non-tax deductible, often with a 2% surcharge. It can be extremely expensive. For many people it will be far cheaper to use marketplace plans.

The nice thing is the ACA made it so you don't term out of your parents' coverage until 27, so my circumstance would have been different. I was covered by my parents' plan until the September after my senior year in college, IIRC, when I was just a bit over 21. I wasn't able to get a job by then which had employer sponsored healthcare, so I was on Kaiser for a few years with a cheap but bare bones HMO plan.

Today, I'd stay on my parents' plan until I found a job with health insurance, or I'd go into the marketplace (Maryland Health Connection, in my case), which has problems but does at least subsidize people when they're low-income, as I was in my early 20s."
science,fdjkj8t,t1_fdjjdik,1578475192.0,"COBRA plans aren't employer or otherwise subsidized, so they can be extremely expensive. I had one briefly in like 2001 after I aged out of my parent's county government plan, and it was maybe $350 for an individual. It was better coverage than the above commenter, but it was crazy expensive, and we're talking 2 decades ago.

I quickly got onto a Kaiser plan that was less than half the cost but definitely worse coverage, and was only that cheap because I was young.

Edit: To address your other comment, $500/mo is middle of the road coverage. As of 2018, [average premiums on the individual market are $440/mo, and average group rates are $574/mo.](https://www.peoplekeep.com/blog/bid/97380/faq-how-much-does-individual-health-insurance-cost) So if their COBRA was $500/mo, it was probably a substandard group plan, which explains the higher than average co-pays.

science,fdjkc6s,t1_fdjbcrj,1578474906.0,"Here's [a decent article about it,](https://askepticalhuman.com/politics/2018/9/10/debunking-right-wing-healthcare-myths-wait-times-rationing) albeit with a left-leaning stance. High level summary - waits for ER, specialist, and non-emergency surgeries are longer in countries such as Canada with public systems than in countries with private plans. The differences are stark, but not extreme. 

That's part of the trade-off of covering everyone and not allowing some people to get fast passes by paying more (happens in the US with Medicaid especially, also happens in mixed systems where private patients are seen quicker).

As an American I'd gladly trade our system for Canada's - though my personal healthcare quality might go down somewhat, it'd cost a fuck ton less and it'd be worth it to know that everyone is covered. Other countries may provide a better template for a public health care system than Canada.

bestof,fdi9mnp,t1_fdhjc8z,1578438220.0,"Agreed. The term ""emotional labor"" [has a different meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_labor) than is being used here. I think of it as the emotional component to work (paid or unpaid), including the effort required to suppress emotions and delay experiencing emotions in the service of a task, which is the sort of thing that follows you home. For example, one of the things my wife liked about moving from social work into computer programming was that there's so much less emotional labor involved. When a client is screaming at you because they can't get a bus pass, or a client who you thought was managing their meds ends up dying, that's some real shit to deal with. And sometimes you can't even deal with those emotions in the moment. 

There's less emotional labor required for me, as well, since hearing about that stuff and being a sounding board is part of my job as a husband.

Now it's more discussion about code and deployment problems, or dealing with inter-personal / managerial issues, which is still stressful for her, but in a different way.

Household work doesn't all fall under the umbrella of ""emotional labor"", though some of it certainly does.

SelfAwarewolves,fdd8w29,t1_fdclofx,1578300209.0,"Honest answer - I think anything outside of basic needs makes sense for capitalism. Defining that isn't super easy, but it's possible. 

Food, housing, transportation, computing and internet access, education - all those are places where basic access could be socialized (and to some extent already are), then if you want to own a McMansion where you Uber Eats your Chipotle order from your new iPhone because your kid took the Beemer to Yale and you don't want to drive the Jag into town, that's on you. 

Almost all healthcare could be socialized, then shit like teeth whitening, unproven / experimental cures, Botox, etc. would be private.

The inevitable ""problem"" is that capitalism will occasionally create products and services which become so indispensable that they need to be shifted to the socialized side of the economy. And technogy will also shift where we draw that line. 

Like, I'd call IOLs and basic hearing aids essential at this point - they're cost-effective, medically proven, and life-changing treatments - but I'd leave premium IOLs and hearing aids to the private sphere.

They could sell upgrades which affect how you're prioritized, or take a page out of T-Mobile's playbook and throttle video to a certain speed unless you pay more.

science,fdkncly,t1_fdjmcnh,1578507155.0,"Nah, bro. COBRA coverage is group coverage, but if you're younger and/or healthier than the median of that group, you're underwriting them to an extent. That's perfectly OK in an employer sponsored group plan since the costs are shared by all employees, subsidized to some extent by the employer, and generally everything is tax deductible. It's also typically high-quality insurance, which again is great as long as your employer is paying a big part of it. 

[COBRA is the full cost of coverage,](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insurance/11/intro-cobra-health-insurance.asp) non-tax deductible, often with a 2% surcharge. It can be extremely expensive. For many people it will be far cheaper to use marketplace plans.

The nice thing is the ACA made it so you don't term out of your parents' coverage until 27, so my circumstance would have been different. I was covered by my parents' plan until the September after my senior year in college, IIRC, when I was just a bit over 21. I wasn't able to get a job by then which had employer sponsored healthcare, so I was on Kaiser for a few years with a cheap but bare bones HMO plan.

Today, I'd stay on my parents' plan until I found a job with health insurance, or I'd go into the marketplace (Maryland Health Connection, in my case), which has problems but does at least subsidize people when they're low-income, as I was in my early 20s."
science,fdjkj8t,t1_fdjjdik,1578475192.0,"COBRA plans aren't employer or otherwise subsidized, so they can be extremely expensive. I had one briefly in like 2001 after I aged out of my parent's county government plan, and it was maybe $350 for an individual. It was better coverage than the above commenter, but it was crazy expensive, and we're talking 2 decades ago.

I quickly got onto a Kaiser plan that was less than half the cost but definitely worse coverage, and was only that cheap because I was young.

Edit: To address your other comment, $500/mo is middle of the road coverage. As of 2018, [average premiums on the individual market are $440/mo, and average group rates are $574/mo.](https://www.peoplekeep.com/blog/bid/97380/faq-how-much-does-individual-health-insurance-cost) So if their COBRA was $500/mo, it was probably a substandard group plan, which explains the higher than average co-pays.

High level summary - waits for ER, specialist, and non-emergency surgeries are longer in countries such as Canada with public systems than in countries with private plans. The differences are stark, but not extreme. 

That's part of the trade-off of covering everyone and not allowing some people to get fast passes by paying more (happens in the US with Medicaid especially, also happens in mixed systems where private patients are seen quicker).

As an American I'd gladly trade our system for Canada's - though my personal healthcare quality might go down somewhat, it'd cost a fuck ton less and it'd be worth it to know that everyone is covered. Other countries may provide a better template for a public health care system than Canada.

bestof,fdi9mnp,t1_fdhjc8z,1578438220.0,"Agreed. The term ""emotional labor"" [has a different meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_labor) than is being used here. I think of it as the emotional component to work (paid or unpaid), including the effort required to suppress emotions and delay experiencing emotions in the service of a task, which is the sort of thing that follows you home. For example, one of the things my wife liked about moving from social work into computer programming was that there's so much less emotional labor involved. When a client is screaming at you because they can't get a bus pass, or a client who you thought was managing their meds ends up dying, that's some real shit to deal with. And sometimes you can't even deal with those emotions in the moment. 

There's less emotional labor required for me, as well, since hearing about that stuff and being a sounding board is part of my job as a husband.

Now it's more discussion about code and deployment problems, or dealing with inter-personal / managerial issues, which is still stressful for her, but in a different way.

Household work doesn't all fall under the umbrella of ""emotional labor"", though some of it certainly does.

Food, housing, transportation, computing and internet access, education - all those are places where basic access could be socialized (and to some extent already are), then if you want to own a McMansion where you Uber Eats your Chipotle order from your new iPhone because your kid took the Beemer to Yale and you don't want to drive the Jag into town, that's on you. 

Almost all healthcare could be socialized, then shit like teeth whitening, unproven / experimental cures, Botox, etc. would be private.

The inevitable ""problem"" is that capitalism will occasionally create products and services which become so indispensable that they need to be shifted to the socialized side of the economy. And technogy will also shift where we draw that line. 

Like, I'd call IOLs and basic hearing aids essential at this point - they're cost-effective, medically proven, and life-changing treatments - but I'd leave premium IOLs and hearing aids to the private sphere.
