It's my source of caffeine, damnit, and I usually drink a brand that has a stevia version with just 60 kcal per bottle, and even if I have to buy Coca Cola, it's not a big deal, and all in all I tend to undereat at that kind of event because most of the food is shitty and I have a busy schedule, so all I get is a supermarket salad bowl at night.

This is especially true for shorter women with a small frame. I am 5'2'', I would have to pack on *a lot* of muscle to even get near a BMI of 25 while being fit, but I could easily get there - and have been there - while being a couch potato and eating too much chocolate. And I was still in size S tops and size M bottoms at that time, yet I was completely out of shape, easily winded, my stomach was bloated, I had jiggly bits all over my torso, I didn't sleep well, I often had headaches, lower back pain, often got sick, etc.

For niche styles it can depend a lot on the specific demographic, e.g. outdoor clothes, yoga wear and similar stuff will probably sell mostly in smaller sizes. Similar with fair / organic fashion because the target demographic is often highly educated and health-conscious people.

Eventually the results are often kind of weird, too, because you are restricted by the shape and style of the original item. If you just want to sew nice clothes, buying plain fabric and starting from scratch with a good pattern makes a whole lot more sense.

This is such a silly exaggerated American response. Nobody was talking about shooting anybody. This was about punishing corporates - with fines, most likely - for profiting disproportionally from seducing consumers into making excessively unhealthy choices.

Regulating school meals, for example, has nothing to do with punishing citizens - it's an investment into the future of a country. Every government should be very interested in that, unfortunately most aren't.

Indeed. I'm always frustrated when I see otherwise sane and reasonable people pull out shit like that."
fatlogic,fdh6zub,t1_fdh0wfe,1578416738.0,"Holy shit. I don't have kids myself, but there are lots of children in my extended family, and most of the parents have pretty strict rules about photos on social media - some even about themselves, not only about the kids, there are a bunch of people who don't post anything at all for a variety of reasons, and the only proper thing to do is to *respect* that. Yes, I think it's sad that I can't publicly post all the cuties in the handknit stuff that I made for them, but if their parents don't consent and the children are too young to consent themselves, that's the way it is, period. 

You are so right to be speechless. Once you're done with that, go and tell her what you think. You are fully in your right to set up rules around that."

fatlogic,fd3iiro,t1_fd39ps5,1578158640.0,Everything is fatphobia these days. Pointing out that nutrition and weight are related. Talking about healthy and unhealthy food. Doing something fashion-related that does *not* focus on obese people. Talking about personal fitness goals.

fatlogic,fd18btg,t1_fcxk80r,1578128499.0,"Exactly. There's a legitimate social justice dimension to all things nutrition / health / fitness etc, and it ties in with lots of the big global problems. In relation to that, complaining about airplane seats is completely ridiculous."

fatlogic,fctrxpo,t1_fcsn874,1577956363.0,"I've read about various ""re-claim our pre-colonial food culture"" initiatives for Northern American indigenous people (both in the US and Canada, I think), and there were men and women leaders. Also, yes, quite predictably the focus of those initiatives is on sustainable hunting, farming, fishing, gathering, and preparing balanced meals from what nature provides, free of industrial crap."

fatlogic,fcq8ab8,t1_fcnx3xa,1577880849.0,"I was just the same with emotional eating. It was definitely not the real me I was seeing in the mirror at my highest weight (and I wasn't even technically overweight, or just barely). 

And after fluctuating a bit during the last few years I know very well that whenever I gain beyond my comfort zone, it's a sign there is something off in my life - stress, exhaustion, bad time management, etc. 

I agree very much with your last paragraph. I work a lot in an environment where lots of people are obese and consider themselves the norm, and I always get a flood of comments about my weirdness."

I also gain weight in my face really fast and really don't like being over 120 for that reason. 

And I do the same with my clothes, all my favourite things are geared towards my preferred weight. It keeps you on your toes!"
fatlogic,fcq73qn,t1_fcnmwre,1577880146.0,"The best one is what you get from your own accumulated data over time. But you can just start with any of the ones you'll find when you google. Eat according to that for a week, weigh yourself, rinse, repeat, and keep an eye on the long-term trend. After a few months you'll know pretty well how much you need to eat to lose, maintain or gain a certain amount of weight."
fatlogic,fcq67h8,t1_fco5a6a,1577879624.0,"I assume you are talking about the US, but there are similar things going on in other countries, even with very different school systems. I'm very involved with swimming, and here in Germany a lot of children don't learn to swim anymore because in many towns public pools are closing due to lack of money, or the remaining pools don't have sufficient capacities for the local schools. 

PE classes are often still run in a very old-fashioned way that only supports the high-achievers and doesn't encourage the unfit kids to get fitter. Well-earning and well-educated parents will take their kids to private sports clubs and stuff, of course, so like always the ones from lower income families suffer the most. In some immigrant communities there is the added problem for girls that they are not allowed to participate in sports (especially stuff like swimming) to the same extent as boys. Nowhere do you see more obese young girls than among conservative low-income families of Middle Eastern origin."
