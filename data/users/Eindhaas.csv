Sexual reproduction is not a necessity for evolution. 

>yet he designed the shapes, the algorithm in defining what each aspect of those creatures do. He provided them with information to run that matrix. Let that sink in for a moment. Without a creator, there’s zero information.

That is mostly a limit of our computer hardware. You can input less and less ""design"" into a simulation like this and it will self construct the neccesary elements if the system is large enough en run for enough time. The simulations refute your argument that evolution is only degenerative, these simulated creatures go from a state of unordered mess to optimized runners purely by mutation and selection. 

>Sorry, but your article only made their opinion and suggestions of how they think it could have been, and is a fluff piece to load your head with unsubstantiated “evidence.” It provides nothing of actual proof.

Well of course it starts with an introductory article, nobody is going to read dozens of scientific articles as an introduction. Your video isn't an article either (and cites no sources either).
