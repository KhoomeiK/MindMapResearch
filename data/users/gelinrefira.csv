Put a live video in everyone's head. FF all their lives and let them see the consequences of their actions. Let the world see the consequences of their actions, or the lack of.

Futurology,ffe0n8g,t1_ffdtiad,1579833639.0,"Which is why we really need to update the interpretation of reasonable privacy. Everything changed when Big Data analytics becomes possible and the reach of social media is unparalleled than any time in human history.

Reasonable privacy has always been under the idea that even if something about you is made public even by you, you do not expect the entire world to know about it. It is not unreasonable to expect a return to certain amount of privacy when you move to a new place or get a new job; that you can leave a large part of your past behind without it being brought up all the time or used against you.

What social media has done to upend this expectation is that you are no longer able to have that anymore. Just because you tweet something or browse a page on engine oil or upload a photo of you at a party does not mean that those data should be minable to create a profile of you at all times so that it can be exploited in some way to target you or even against you. 

No way the Founding Fathers could have envision something like this happening. No way they would think that this is okay. No way that any reasonable interpretation, even today, of the difference between privacy and public domain can ever justify large scale data mining, and using social media reach to profile people either as a group or individual. For what? For no other reason than to make it easier to sell you things, or on a more insidious side, to track your way of thinking, and ultimately to shape it.  

Big Data mining, and social media reach allow large scale thought policing and public opinion manipulation by shadowy means possible, and by a small group of people. This can reduce your ability to exercise your own will. You are supposed to convince people by the force your ideas, not by the deliberate manipulation of their inner desires, or weaknesses to achieve a certain effect. If you are carefully curated to choose between the choices powerful people want you to choose, do you really think you actually have a choice? I think If you describe this social phenomena and technology to a raised undead but otherwise lucid Ben F.,  I bet he will be horrified beyond measure."

Futurology,ffe0n8g,t1_ffdtiad,1579833639.0,"Which is why we really need to update the interpretation of reasonable privacy. Everything changed when Big Data analytics becomes possible and the reach of social media is unparalleled than any time in human history.

Reasonable privacy has always been under the idea that even if something about you is made public even by you, you do not expect the entire world to know about it. It is not unreasonable to expect a return to certain amount of privacy when you move to a new place or get a new job; that you can leave a large part of your past behind without it being brought up all the time or used against you.

What social media has done to upend this expectation is that you are no longer able to have that anymore. Just because you tweet something or browse a page on engine oil or upload a photo of you at a party does not mean that those data should be minable to create a profile of you at all times so that it can be exploited in some way to target you or even against you. 

No way the Founding Fathers could have envision something like this happening. No way they would think that this is okay. No way that any reasonable interpretation, even today, of the difference between privacy and public domain can ever justify large scale data mining, and using social media reach to profile people either as a group or individual. For what? For no other reason than to make it easier to sell you things, or on a more insidious side, to track your way of thinking, and ultimately to shape it.  

Big Data mining, and social media reach allow large scale thought policing and public opinion manipulation by shadowy means possible, and by a small group of people. This can reduce your ability to exercise your own will. You are supposed to convince people by the force your ideas, not by the deliberate manipulation of their inner desires, or weaknesses to achieve a certain effect. If you are carefully curated to choose between the choices powerful people want you to choose, do you really think you actually have a choice?

Everyday America grows weaker with assholes leading the fools. There will be a time when we get smashed in our face and then I predict a lot of these same people will whine like little bitches and cry foul.

With the way this admin is destroying our alliances and strengthening our rivals, one day when we reach out for help, we will find no one there to hold it. And we have no one else but ourselves to blame."

An aging population will put a strain on resources but if people are paid according to the productivity they reach, Social Security contribution should simply react accordingly.

Where is our fucking money?"
politics,fexv8jk,t1_fexkd1b,1579437080.0,"That just tells me people are not being paid fairly. Ironically, Social Security can be used as a benchmark on how the value generated by the people are being distributed. If the division of the produced value is uneven, in that a disproportion amount of it is going taxpaying citizens, then Social Security will not be able to fund itself because it only draws from citizens. It shows that there is a systemic problem.

So where is our fucking money?"

And the word you're looking for is Corporatist."
Futurology,fex8y1v,t1_fev5ezt,1579427025.0,"It's neo-feudalism.

They controlled the government yes. But what they want their own little fiefdom, in the real world and the virtual one. They want their company towns where the company controls every aspect of their employees' lives. They want to be kings in their own domain rather than princes in one big one.

We can all see this coming from miles away. This is not freedom, this is slavery with extra steps."
politics,fex834h,t1_fewx9ql,1579426600.0,"That's an interesting caveat. Why is that rule there in the first place.

Social Security is in a crisis seem contradictory. It is a self funding program. So long there are people working, making money and producing value, SS should not be insolvent. You might have to adjust some things but it should not even need to be cut. It is doubly nonsensical when you consider that productivity has gone up tremendously. We are producing more value per worker than ever before. We should be able to support SS, even expand it with no problem. 

The real question we should be asking is where did all the value we produce go? Where the fuck is our money?"
