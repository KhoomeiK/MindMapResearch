You'll be surprised how much scars can heal both emotional and physical. Trust me, I know.

You're so young mate, I know you don't feel it but this is not how you'll feel five years from now with your whole life to go.

The fact you reach out means part of you knows this isn't the right thing for you. 

Just do one thing for me, please. For you for your family and friends who love you so much. Wait a week. Tell someone close to you how you feel. If you still want to die, you can always change your mind. If you die, you can't change it."

Surely better performance on tech is better than cleaner nicer code and having less of it, within reason.

SuicideWatch,fezuxlf,t1_fezrm3b,1579461984.0,That they're unique and honestly probably a good person. Depression puts us through a lot but I believe it can ultimately make a person kinder and more empathetic. Not that it's a good thing but good can come of it and we need kinder people to stick around.

My parents were also very unpredictable people who were always at each others throats. My only advice is to come up with a plan at least for independence. Education in a sought after field, a job, anything and work towards it. There is a Nietzsche quote ""he who has a why can deal with any how."" Find your why friend and you'll be able to cope with your parents for the time it takes to get out of there. I believe in you. Now that I'm independent I actually have a much healthier relationship with my parents."

SuicideWatch,fetpotu,t1_fetnyep,1579378091.0,Thank you and I'll try and remember you when I need someone to reach out to. But my parents is a no go. To put things in perspective the first thing my mum said at the hospital after one of my attempts (the first they knew about) was that if I did this again to make sure I did it right.
SuicideWatch,fetj4dt,t1_fetbi1o,1579375975.0,Unfortunately I can't. All I have is my parents who don't believe depression exists. They had worse childhoods and maybe more scars than I do. I have never ever been able to talk to them and I also have no friends. I am alone.
SuicideWatch,fet50gh,t3_eqjn9b,1579371846.0,"That is your depression as I'm sure you know. That part is sucking the joy out of what you love and expressing itself as anger and sadness to everything around you, including yourself.

SuicideWatch,fet3qrb,t3_eqjvmi,1579371536.0,"Sounds very familiar, my ten year-old diary is riddled with death wishes. I'm also on that border of not knowing if it was really that bad a childhood or is it just me, an inherent weakness or chemical composition?

I wish I could tell my younger self to get help and it's advice you and I should take. We've been through so much so doesn't that make us strong? Doesn't that make this fight so fucking goddamn far from over?"
SuicideWatch,fet2w9j,t3_eqj1ml,1579371314.0,"Mate you think you're a failure but that was your mind rejecting what you were doing. You know deep down you're better than that person you were trying to be, that you think you have to be. You're not this cold psychopath and so you couldn't go through with it because you know the truth is that paying a human being for sex is neither good not erotic. So how the hell were you going to get aroused for it?

This isn't a failure. Your time will come with a woman who actually wants to be with you and it will happen. You are also depressed, and need to cut yourself a break. See a therapist, take antidepressants if you need to to get over it and then you will not only feel different but be much more likely to actually meet someone. Having depression is hard enough without holding yourself to these absurd pornstar standards. You're not a failure you're a human being.

Please please hold on and please please see a therapist."
SuicideWatch,fet1j18,t3_eqjtrx,1579370936.0,This is so temporary and is the drugs talking. You've got to hold on. These things take ten times the damage for being sober. You will not feel this bad in a month I promise.

As you qualify though the Scorch has other strengths and can slaughter infantry better and faster than a Ronin, the exception being any infantry above titan height (on rooftops etc.)... Or infantry at a distance. As for 1 Vs 1, if time is of the essence and/or if close quarters is made almost unavoidable (as happens in attrition all the time) I would still bet on Papa."
