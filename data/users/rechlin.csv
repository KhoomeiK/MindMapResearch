I'm actually surprised that Metro is going to build out rail to Hobby, because the numbers don't seem to work for that as well as some other routes.

Commuter rail lines would be nice, too, but the commuter buses aren't seeing much of an increase in ridership, making it unlikely that commuter rail will be justifiable anytime soon.  But we definitely should be preserving right-of-way for them in the future.

The best places for rail would be where there are currently bus lines with high ridership.  Lines like the Fondren, Scott, Bellfort, Gessner, Bellaire, Westheimer, Bissonnet, Beechnut, and Richmond routes could be well served by rail due to how many people use them.

The roads are made of segments, and this web site only shows entire road segments.  If a road segment ends in the city chosen, it is displayed.  If it ends outside that city, it is not displayed.  They are not broken on the city limits.  Where the ""start"" and ""end"" of a road segment is located is entirely arbitrary; I believe it's just the order in which the segment was drawn by the original person doing the mapping.  Segment divisions are also totally arbitrary; a road could be broken into segments on every block (or even multiple times within a single block) or a single segment could go on for miles, depending on how the person mapping it decided to do it.

For example, one segment of Braesmont Drive starts in Houston and ends in Bellaire.  This means that segment is shown in its entirety on the Bellaire map but not shown at all on the Houston map.  Similarly, a segment of Chimney Rock Road starts in Bellaire and ends in Houston.

I have a friend who flew the 737 for decades, from early ones with the gravel kit all the way through the Next Generation ones. Admittedly he has no experience (to my knowledge) flying the MAX, as he's been flying the 777 and now the 787 in recent years.

When I asked him about the 737 MAX debacle, he said the plane itself is just fine. The only problem is the flight characteristics are different from the previous 737 series. Because Boeing didn't want pilots to have to get more than cursory training over the differences, they put in special software to make it fly like the old ones. The problem here is that when this software fails, they don't know how to recover, because of faults in the software design and lack of training in handling the plane without the software operational.

He believes the plane would be perfectly safe if instead pilots were just trained properly with the new 737 MAX. The only problem is Boeing wanted to save money by preventing the 737 MAX from getting a new airplane designation that would require such training. Furthermore, he believes that the reason the crashes were only on the ""lesser"" airlines is he believes that pilots in North America and Europe are simply better trained in general than those in developing countries and more likely to handle such emergency situations. After all, one of the doomed planes had just been saved on an earlier flight by an experienced pilot who happened to be in the cockpit at the time. 

He said he wouldn't hesitate to be a passenger on a 737 MAX right now, as long as the flight crew was properly trained. Of course fixing the software bugs should be required too, before it should get air worthiness again."

It is true that Texas is less suited for refugees than other states for a variety of reasons (I personally think the sprawl and need for a car for almost everyone is the biggest issue), but it makes sense that TX would be #2 after CA for resettlement due to being #2 (though back then #3) in population and also having such great diversity in the cities.  I disagree that our economy is unstable or that we have a major homelessness problem.  Only 4000 people homeless in the Harris/Montgomery County survey out of 5 million people is actually a pretty good number, though it clearly could be improved.  There will always be homeless so it's wrong to use their existence as an excuse to not help others who can be more easily helped.

I still don't think that the relatively small number of refugees is going to depress wages much.  If they are getting jobs quicker than non-refugees, then maybe they are simply better qualified or more ambitious and therefore more deserving.  Complacence and laziness can lead to major problems (I'm sure it's a contributing factor to some problems in the Gulf oil states like Saudi Arabia), and perhaps we need to be kept on our toes a bit to prevent stagnation."
houston,fehy206,t1_fehvlbz,1579126158.0,"Syria is just one of many places that are a source of refugees.  But these bans on refugees are blanket bans, affecting everyone.  In my hometown which has always been generous with refugees (admittedly I moved to Houston as an adult, 20 years ago), as I said earlier, in 2019 they only got refugees from Ukraine (like Pentacostal Christians who are oppressed by the government there) and Congo (fleeing violence in their communist dictatorship).  Meanwhile another big issue is the oppressed Burmese Rohinga minority are mostly living as refugees in Bangladesh, which can't handle them.  And lots of other countries have refugees.  Syria was a major source of refugees for a while, but what you mean by ""en masse"" is hard to say.  Obama hasn't been president for 3 years, so it seems strange to blame him for refugees from other countries being cut off since then."

I'm sorry, I missed that key word.  It did technically drop from 2018 to 2019, though, but the lack of progress there makes me wonder if they have been focusing resources elsewhere.

> It sure does, so how would an influx of refugees not drastically exacerbate this?

That's harder to say.  It might slightly exacerbate this, but really, the number of refugees is quite small so it may not be statistically significant.

> But you just got through telling me that we need to spend money on refugees, or else they become homeless and jobless which does nothing to help the economy.

No, I didn't.  I said resources (meaning the time of volunteers), not money.  The refugees aren't getting handouts.

> Are you telling me that there will be no public funds spent housing, clothing, and feeding refugees, and that it will all be driven by charity?

The word ""no"" is very strong here.  I'm sure at least a dollar in public money is being spent, so even if the number is very small it wouldn't be zero.  But it's by and large mostly charities.  The housing, clothing, and feeding is paid for by the refugees themselves, though.  Thankfully the US doesn't have ridiculous laws like some European countries that prohibit refugees from getting jobs."
houston,fehp9q9,t1_fehhn47,1579121145.0,"Unemployment rate in Houston is 3.6% with the latest available figures.  That's effectively full employment.

Homelessness hasn't been on the rise since 2016, and it's disingenuous to say that.  Yes, it's higher than 2016, but phrasing it your way is misleading.  Homelessness saw a **one-time** jump in 2018 (vs 2017) thanks to Harvey, after dropping in 2017, and then dropped in 2019 and presumably will drop in 2020 (the survey is done in January so the numbers should be out reasonably soon).  We're not yet back to pre-Harvey levels, but it takes time to recover from a disaster that wiped out so much affordable housing, and increased rents since then reflect that.

By talking about hurricane relief, you are still trying to make it sound like refugees are a cost center like hurricane victims.  But that's not the case.

> Why would this mentality change when talking about refugees rather than citizens?

You keep trying to change the discussion.  Chronically homeless people and hurricane victims need money spent on them to either subsidize their lives or restore what they lost.  That requires funding.  Refugees don't need that.  They aren't looking for handouts, so there is no ""free stuff"" involved.  They generally need the help of a caseworker to find them a job and locate an apartment and acclimate them to a totally different lifestyle.  They are used to a different culture with a different language and different food and different ways of navigating bureaucracy, and manpower is needed for a short time to help them with this.  This is typically done by religious charities such as Lutheran Social Services (a particular group I am familiar with).  Before long they are independent and contributing to the economy -- as I said, refugees even have to reimburse the airfare spent on them to get them to this country.

And if a charity wants to put more time into helping refugees vs helping homeless, who are we to judge how they want to help?  Everyone is free to put their resources where they best see fit; it is wrong and goes against American values to have the government tell a charity they should be helping one group of people vs a different group of people.  When there are people who want to use their own resources helping refugees, why tell them no?"
houston,fehc7cl,t1_feh8ep3,1579113559.0,"Houston's unemployment rate is so low that we are considered to be at ""full employment"".  In other words, nobody is unemployed for long who is employable and who is not choosing to be unemployed (perhaps because they are waiting for a higher paying job).  Simply put, refugees are not taking jobs away from the homeless.  In fact, in the long run refugees create more jobs (after all, the economy is not a zero-sum game).

In Houston, our homelessness problem has gotten far better in recent years, with only a fraction living on the streets now as there were 5-10 years ago.  Aside from the temporarily homeless (some are only very briefly homeless and quickly get back on their feet -- thankfully there are plenty of resources for most of these), most of those who are still homeless are not ready for homes yet.  I believe that we need a lot more to be spent on mental health to address those, however, because most of the chronically homeless are suffering from addiction or untreated psychological conditions, but that's a completely separate issue.

You can't really equate helping the homeless to helping refugees because doing one doesn't necessarily take away from doing the other.  Refugees are usually in good shape to work and only need minimal assistance the first few months.  Many of the homeless need significantly more resources and have much greater difficulty in becoming self-sustaining.  The ""easy"" homeless cases have largely been addressed already.

If this were purely about money, nobody would be homeless, because the local government spends more money on costs generated by the homeless (frequent EMS calls and transportation, policing, etc) than they would need to spend to just give them free housing.  But instead it's a political thing, where people don't believe it would be fair for the homeless to be given free housing even if that would cost taxpayers less than leaving them on the street, because of a mentality of ""why should they get free stuff if I don't get free stuff"".  And also of course there will always be a small number who prefer to be homeless."
houston,feh7z64,t1_feh3uy6,1579111029.0,"What I mean is that resources are needed in the initial few months to help the refugees find jobs and locate accommodations and things like that.  If you have too many refugees for the resources, these things won't get addressed so the refugees will be homeless and jobless.  That's clearly a bad thing, and has resulted in problems with refugees in Europe where way too many were let in at once.  So you should only bring in as many refugees as you have the infrastructure to handle.  No country can handle bringing in millions per year, and very few can handle bringing in several hundred thousand.  That's why there have been problems in countries like Turkey, Bangladesh, and even Germany to an extent.  Some countries can handle only a few thousand per year, but the US can easily handle (and has handled, until the last couple years) a hundred thousand per year.

The refugees pay back their airfare so being on the other side of the world is not something that affects us, it just means they have to pay more to get settled.  And of course they pay more for housing in the US than they would in developing countries.  However, that's made up for by the typically higher paying jobs they'd get here compared to elsewhere."
houston,feh367s,t1_feh2kdy,1579108186.0,"Oftentimes they do.  Look how many millions ended up in Turkey from Syria.  Also, some resources are needed for the first few months to resettle them, before the payback time begins, and some of those countries are overwhelmed with a lot of refugees before they get a chance to catch up.  But even if that weren't the case, don't you think it would be nice for us to benefit from the refugees, too?  The US has plenty of resources to easily absorb 100,000 refugees per year, so we might as well use those and get the long-term benefit.  The town I grew up in took in a lot of Bosnian refugees when I was a kid, and they still continue to take in refugees, with last year's group from Ukraine and Congo.  They certainly contributed a lot more to the community than they took away."
