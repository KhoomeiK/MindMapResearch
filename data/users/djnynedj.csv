Have a best friend who has smoked crack for the last 15 years, in the past year in all his wisdom started smoking meth to quit the crack. Now does both. And they are cutting crack with fentanyl now. He has started admitting he is hearing voices now. Drug psychosis.  

Over the years I've been through getting him in rehab, let he and his gf stay with me, AA meetings,being his accountability partner, tried it all and yet he still does it. 

I have a fiancee kids and a family and I really love him but I don't have the time or the energy anymore to try and save him. He has a pattern of moving other addicts in with him because of the whole ""do the next right thing"", so he focuses on helping them and assumes that will keep him sober.

I believe in a higher power, maybe power that is within us. 

Religion is a cute idea, but creating a for-profit business that essentially controls people with the fear of retribution and promises salvation if only we believe as ""they"" do is kind of perverse. 

If you believe the bible, Jesus was hated by the jews because he ministered to every race, regardless of position, wealth, sexual purity or disease. 

He preached love tolerance and acceptance. 

In terms of Christianity, today we find some denominations (Southern Baptist) still preach hellfire and brimstone, while others (think MEGA Church) preach the ""prosperity gospel.  

Catholics get a healthy dose of guilt (but are handed a hall pass via confession) while the rest of the western religions mix and match different elements of the aforementioned. 

Oh, and some quite frankly create a religion based on science fiction (Scientology).

Religion IS escapism, and provides people a rulebook, something to believe in. 

It absolves them from their sins when they are close to death. 

It insulates them from the more likely reality that they've been duped. It allows each individual to feel like their ""religion"" is the only one, the golden ticket to heaven. 

Religion is man made and used to control the masses.

These ""politicians"" and government officials are supposed to represent all people from the different cities, towns, burgs, regions, states, or entire nation. 

Our lawmakers we trust to write laws that treat all people equally and fairly, our military we expect to defend all it's people, courts and judges we expect to show no political bias and use the constitution to follow and enforce the law, and our police force we expect to serve and protects ALL citizens.

Although not uncommon in our short history,, corruption has never been as high as it's current level. We have a President who, supported by very powerful people around the world, has been compromised and has sold us out to the highest bidder, all in the name of vanity. 

He and his handlers have bypassed our usual system of checks and balances and effectively corrupted the high courts and the Senate. 
Congress is essentially the only check and balance in an administration that does whatever it wants, whenever it wants, with little accountability.

By rolling back the policies, eliminating regulations, and trying undue established laws, they have done significant damage to the almsot all the good the previous administration has done.

Barack Obama, although he made mistakes, was by far one of the smartest, most diplomatically astute, and historically successful Ptesidents in decades. 

Donald Trump has taken advantage of criminal enterprises funded by Russians and Ukranians to get elected, appointed officials to posts in departments that, in their previous jobs they detested. 

He's made the job title precursor ""acting"" the norm, given the rich the biggest tax breaks in history, allowed big oil and the pharmaceutical companies to dictate policy, and has gaslit his evangelicals voter base to the point where they literally worship him and believe that he is the ""imperfect savior"" he tells them they were promised. 

He's rolled back the clock AND the rights of women, demonized and expelled immigrants, including putting them and their children in cages, embraced dictators while purposefully severing ties with our allies, dismantled the arts, embraced white nationalists, admitting he IS A Nationalist and also treated one of our two territories,Puerto Rico, like a third world country, while calling countries with black and brown people ""shithole"" countries. 

This man has pissed on our constitution, allowing foreign interests to gain a foothold, weakened our National Security, profited by breaking virtually all emolument clauses, and turned House and Senate Republicans into sycophants who understand that disagreeing with POTUS means political suicide. 

He has used Fox News and a few other select news organizations as his personally media outlet while proclaiming that every other media outlet that criticizes and or reports his wrongdoings as ""fake news"" and actually called the mainstream media the ""enemy of the state"".

So, you ask, why don't we protest? 

Where do we start, when the people we have paid to keep the order are the ones breaking the law?

Good luck, I'm healing right along with you. If we share experiences we at least have a chance at keeping our sanity, even if we didnt keep our toe(s). 🙂"

offmychest,fdn6lec,t1_fdmvuy9,1578578697.0,"There is truth in humor. 

I still think it's a valid question ... when does being nice turn into flirting? 

I've seen this from men and women, flirting and leading people on to get a sale or close the deal. 

Some people admittedly don't understand this. They get the wrong message. Maybe if people didn't use their sexual powers to lead people on (I think that's called manipulation) then maybe there would be less situations where there is confusion. 

There's a huge difference between smiling at someone to be nice and polite and whispering in their ear to thank them as you lightly brush your fingers across their cheek. 

I'm sorry if my joke fell on dead ears and in retro probably a poor thread to joke on, but is funny to see, for example, men and women on Instagram bare there souls and bodies in the name of self promotion and ego, but then ignore or be rude at people who see them say hello and tell them they are their ""followers"" or, unfortunately, get overzealous fans/stalkers.

These days, like it or not, anybody who uses social media and doesn't vet the people on their ""friends"" list runbthe risk of having stalkers. I left FB for this reason."

offmychest,fdmj4cw,t3_elxt3x,1578551774.0,"Just because a guy comes to you're work place everyday, rides the same bus, and follows you home does NOT mean I am ... uh, I mean THEY are, stalking you. 

Okay maybe. 

But learn to flirt without throwing sex at me and I won't go all ""Buffalo Bill"".

(Kidding, Sarcasm)

But question? 

If flirting is what people do to show others they are attracted to them, isn't it weird or fucked up to do it to somebody they are NOT attracted to (aka lead them on) and then get pissy when that person gets ""the wrong message""? 

Seems like flirting and being nice are different things, maybe people get it confused."

worldnews,fcw2bf2,t3_ej11dn,1578015509.0,"This man represents everything President Trump stands for and idolizes. 

Even other soldiers say Gallagher is a psychopath.  Man should be in jail, stripped of all medals, and be charged with war crimes. Are you suprised trump pardoned him?

Trump has advocated that the whistleblower and anybody who protects his identity be hung.  Hes idolizes brutal dictators like Kim and Vladimir and Erdogan.  Here wants to be a dictator.  He thinks it's okay to kill children. He's a f'dup man who knows exactly what he is doing.  Unless we have him removed he wont leave office. 

Also remember that Trump endorsed Governor Matt Bevin, who recently pardoned a man who murdered and dismembered my fiancee's childhood friend's Mom.  He killed her, cut her head off, stuffed the body in a barrel holding her own head and put chemicals in to dissolve the body. 

Bevin also pardoned 159 others including people charged with child rape and murder, and one in particular who raised $20,000 for his campaign.  

I wouldnt be suprised if Gallagher ends up running for office. Like minds and all. 

Screw them all. The bad guys are winning. Why are we rewarding bad people by appointing them to office? 

I would argue that people who support men like these are also monsters. I sure can't turn a blind eye to people who love to make people suffer, enjoy revenge, cage children, sexually assault women and are just bad bad people."
offmychest,fcvzt14,t3_eiqnqy,1578013854.0,"Well everything went as good as can be expected. My recovery time will be most likely about 2 months. Completely non weight bearing, which means I have to use crutches or stay in bed. The physical therapist here gave me some exercises to do that will help me get in better shape.  I'll be able to walk again with custom inserts.

 I think each person with neuropathy is affected differently. I don't really get sharp pains in my feet like you do, instead I have no feeling up to about halfway up my calves. I could literally drop a bowling ball on my foot and I wouldn't feel it. 

However one of the things that really drew attention to the fact that something must be wrong was that I started to feel pain in my foot, which I never do. 

There are several drugs that doctors can give you for pain. I'm also on the antidepressant cymbalta which actually is used for people with neuropathy, but I can't double up with another medicine. 

It is bothersome though. I really deal more with the feeling of cramping through my legs not sharp pains.

OH, let me correct myself, I just remembered that when I first noticed the neuropathy in college it was when I would drink alot of beer. Which caused high blood sugar.  It started out as tingling and numbness. Eventually it spread up. 

All I can suggest is eat and be as healthy as possible.  Don't smoke. Don't excessively drink. 

Im 4 days without a cigarette, have the patch in here, and am going til get Juul once I am out. I quit drinking 4 years ago.  I do smoke marijuana, but that will be the extent of any smoking I do.  

I always offer the truth up when it comes to my health, because even through this loss of limbs maybe I can help prevent someone else from going through it."
