howto,fdf7atp,t1_fdep4cv,1578354962.0,It's a feel kinda thing. Gotta use a properly weighted pen and it's a lot harder with a lid that extends down far. You'll notice that I broke that piece off my pen. Happy spinning!

Entrepreneur,fcgaf8l,t3_eh5tm5,1577638065.0,"Chiming in here because I have actual experience as an Amazon seller.

I was let go of my last job, more than 4.5 years ago now. Been selling on Amazon full time since then.

I don't drive a Lamborghini nor would I ever waste my money on that. I don't live in a mansion. I don't post revenue screenshots cause it's nobody's damn business. 

What I do have is a family to support. I have a wife and three sons to care for and they aren't starving, lol.

I have run a Facebook community for Canadian sellers for the past 3 years now and I have dozens of friends who are successful sellers. 

I have hosted over 40 events in the Toronto area including two Amazon sellers conferences and have friends doing well over 7 figures in revenue, full time. 

Some do private label, some wholesale, some arbitrage.. Most, a combination. 

Private label is the most difficult, competitive and requires much more capital to begin with but can yield the highest of margins. Good PL sellers will have anywhere between 25-100% ROI. 

Wholesale margins are much lower in the 10-15% ROI range where relationships are the most important asset, a much more volume play. 

Arbitrage, there can be high margins also but there are many more drawbacks, it's tough to scale and it's most like having a job, albeit one where you still get to be the *boss*. 

Is it possible? It most certainly is.

Is it difficult as hell just like running any other business? It most certainly is.

One of my most recent clients is on mat leave this year and she does not want to return to work this coming April.

This month she has generated close to $40,000 CAD in sales revenue with a net ROI of 22%.

She has worked extremely hard to make this happen and has made a lot of mistakes along the way. She *does* wake up at 5am most days but that's so she can source before her newborn gets up to feed. 

She is doing arbitrage exclusively atm.

Didn't mean to write so much but I feel there's way too many people who try something once, fail and knock on it like it's impossible to make money from it. Or worse yet, those who have never sold a single item telling others that it doesn't work.

If you do decide to get into it, know that there's a huge learning curve and a ton of crap to deal with, often unfair to the individual seller but this is the risk required to profit off the largest e-commerce platform the world has seen.

Good luck out there."
