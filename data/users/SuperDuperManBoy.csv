fatlogic,ff3dfpb,t3_erfoyd,1579538892.0,"Well if you spent a decade or so basically doing a one person reenactment of The Feast of Bacchus, then you can spend some time at a caloric deficit. 

Also, calling a diet a ""famine"" is just beyond weird to me. You aren't an Irish farmer in the 1800's, you just need a few more carrots and a few less Little Debbie snack cakes."

Hell, even now at 170, I get people saying how skinny I am (though to be fair to them, I do have the skinniest little ballerina wrists... best way I can describe them)."

For a group of people who cry and complain that doctors want no more than people's money, they still love to complain that doctors won't take their money for such things as... ya know... *you have a high risk of complications should they take said money and perform the surgery.*"

fatlogic,fcyk8ml,t3_ejj6oh,1578081513.0,"Or how about we don't police how people interact with one another (within reason, obviously). If I see a friend and they've been looking good lately, I'm going to say it if I damn well want to. If someone else gets offended by my encouraging comments to another person then that's on them and an issue they need to work out. 

If someone complimented my friend's artwork, I'm not going to get offended because my artistic abilities max out at a stick figure family standing in front of a square with a triangle on top... getting offended at someone else's compliments is just an ice cream sundae of a me-first attitudes."
