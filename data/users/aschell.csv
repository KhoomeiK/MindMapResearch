VizioTV,ffzpv4k,t3_evy76v,1580389335.0,I’m sad to ask you not to buy a vizio. I had 6 people all buy one with me two years ago and 3 of them have all gone bad. A panel has begun flashing or lines on the screen. I thought that was anecdotal until I started researching online and saw how many were in the same boat. If you do buy vizio I’d recommend the longest extended warranty you can get.
Divorce,ffzouhq,t3_evy4na,1580388388.0,Why do you think you two are getting divorced?
Dan_Carlin,fftivx9,t3_ev4lme,1580221727.0,This is pretty in line with his normal release schedule sadly.
survivinginfidelity,ffkzi7t,t3_etzap2,1580032023.0,"When I learned my Wife cheated on me I thought it must have been because I was an unworthy and unlovable partner, and a failure as a man. I loved her so much, and it was unbelievable to me that she was leaving me for someone else. 

Her Mother reached out to me and said basically everything you’ve written in your message above and it meant so so very much to me. It helped me forgive myself. It let me know that she was proud of me and the husband she knew I was. It gave me confidence that I truly had put in my every effort and I had loved my Wife well, and she knew it too. 

I encourage you to email or text a version of your message, but please, don’t write anything about the couple reconnecting. Please leave that to them. 

Please be kind to yourself here, and know your daughters actions aren’t your fault or a result of your parenting. I’m sorry you’re going through this."
wholesomememes,ffhgmdv,t1_ffhgfhd,1579934381.0,That gives me something to think about. Thank you for taking the time to answer thoroughly.
wholesomememes,ffhg1rs,t1_ffhfeaq,1579933703.0,"There are medial schools and laboratories all over the world with healthcare advancements and brilliant doctors alike, but I don’t doubt that the US is the most advanced, and has the most breakthroughs of any nation. I’m sure the US does share technology which saves lives all over the world. 

People in the US however, pay more for healthcare than say, Canada, but on average, receive worse treatment. I don’t have a source off hand, but we’re just talking here. 

Do you, assuming you’re American, ever desire a system like Canada’s, for instance? Or what improvements do you think could be made to your country’s healthcare system?"
wholesomememes,ffhenod,t1_ffhdpbg,1579932114.0,"The issue here is competitiveness with other nations - not that a miracle of science and medicine has taken place without appreciation. 

If this happened in Canada, the UK, or Japan, the parents could be thankful for modern since and begin their lives. A system like this could exist in the US, though not without its troubles, it helps avoid the suicide of new parents due to medical debt.

What’s your take?"

RedWingShoes,ff1u9sl,t3_eqzgmd,1579486327.0,"These do look a little large on you. 

I bought some size 9 iron rangers in 2013 and wore them with inserts until this last year when I accepted that they really were too large for me. 

I managed to sell them for $180 online, and bought a pair of size 7.5 beckmans. They were very tight at first, and required quite a bit of breaking in, but now they fit me like a glove. A much better fit and feel than my 9s ever were. Live and learn."

antiMLM,fct6fik,t1_fct180n,1577934095.0,Some readable summaries and overviews would be great. I just visited the site and after 30 seconds I left because it looks like it’s going to be a huge amount of work to just navigate to information.
AskWomenOver30,fcsyocn,t3_eimicp,1577928423.0,"In general, always try to have the other party give their number first. 

If you have to be the first to list a number give a higher than average number, but mention. That you are open to reasonable counter offers. 

Have a set price in your mind going into the negotiation, you should try to get that price and no lower. 

Thinking win win is generally best at the end of the day. You’re trying to sell something for a reasonable value, and the other should be getting a reasonable deal. Reasonable is whatever you decide."
