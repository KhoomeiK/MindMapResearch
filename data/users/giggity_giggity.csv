facepalm,fgq3cvn,t1_fgq0ezs,1581017091.0,"One point, addressed separately, I did do a look for the ""60,000"" reference and this is what I found:

> For example, imagine Medicare for All were financed with a broad tax equal to 25 percent of income. In that case, a single 40-year-old making $100,000 and currently paying $10,000 in premiums and cost-sharing would end up paying $15,000 more; meanwhile, a family of four making $60,000 and paying $25,000 in premiums and cost sharing would end up paying $10,000 less (these figures exclude tax and wage interactions). The more progressive the revenue stream, the fewer people who will end up paying more but the larger net increase those people will face.

That's a pretty loaded assumption that it would be based on a 25% income tax (of all income).  I don't think anyone is proposing a 25% income tax on the first dollar to pay for it.

> The more progressive the revenue stream, the fewer people who will end up paying more but the larger net increase those people will face.

Yes, that is true.  It likely will be a progressive tax scheme (not a very effectively regressive ""flat tax"" as suggested in the article.  People like me will end up paying more in taxes.  And I am ok with that because I believe it will be better for the country overall.

Honestly, while I haven't heard of this organization before, their use of a basic flat tax example, which no Medicare for All proponent has suggested and which is in practice very regressive, makes me question whether they are truly trying to be non-partisan in their analysis."

I believe that at least part of that derives from the health care system itself (I am sure some comes from things like our couch potato, fast food culture).  But a good chunk comes from significant profit-taking at many levels (pharma, insurance).  I do believe that with a national health care system we'll be able to operate much more efficiently, which will reduce the cost of the overall system."
facepalm,fgpy2pm,t1_fgptaxy,1581014206.0,"The proposals (and analysis of those proposals) shows that any tax increase would be more than offset by the reduction in premiums, copays etc.  Yes, for some covered under employer sponsored plans where they have employers who pay 100% of the cost there would need to be an adjustment strategy.  But no, the ones who are ""hurt"" by the ACA, are those paying their own way.  And they would be much better off under these proposals (less out of pocket cost).

sidenote:  the only ones ""hurt"" by the ACA were those who had grossly insufficient coverage.   Of course anyone who is healthy and never needs their insurance (and therefore never found out that it was previously insufficient) is going to feel ""cheated"" when they're forced to buy sufficient insurance.
