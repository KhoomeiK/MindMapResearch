* Have an auto function where it plays out the stage and moves on to the next without you being around - it feels like it could be doable since there it the repeat battle function in the game already.
* Make the rewards more interesting for lower levels, so that early game players could get decent stuff and would try their luck at playing Hard early levels.
* Tower to bring in restrictions to force roster diversity. Yes, this one would be controversial due to the difficulty of getting decent gear, but it could be fun to have monthly ""challenges"" where you're restricted from using Dark Units, from using Warriors and so on.

She doesn't have huge normal heals but she cleanses a lot more debuffs. I've found her to be much more valuable in Raids due to how many debuffs she can cleanse.

Her sleep can help but is completely optional and her S3 bring immunity. She is much faster than Angelica due to her innate kit and if you give her Tagehel she can lap so many units that it makes up for her lower healing.

Also her animations are faster than Angelica's and I prefer her sprite, but that's nitpicking.

\_\_

Overall, Momo and Ange are on-par. Momo is more like a battery of small heals and cleansing/immunity, while Ange is a bazooka of heals and the occasional cleanses/immunity.

And Momo has much more Eff. Resist innately (you want at least 100% due to her mastery tree) which means she is much less likely to get stunned. As such, it's a lot more easier to auto as you can cleanses/heal reactively with Momo, whereas you need to plan a lot more for Ange to use her S3 properly.

\_\_

My Momo is my Wyvern tank as well and I can easily 3-man it, but I have really good gear on her. Otherwise, Angelica is easier to use for Wyvern since she is more bulky.

In any case, there is nothing forcing you to pay. If the devs can afford to display such prices, it's because people buy them, whether you like it or not. Yes, it's an outrageous price, but so long as their will be demand, then the offers will follow suit."
RaidShadowLegends,fegrrp9,t1_fegrlh6,1579101019.0,"I'm at the same point but I don't bother too much.

Try to refresh often and see if you can find easy teams to beat. If not, then keep working on your units and on taking your farmer to level 60. Once you do, it'll be easier to level the rest of your team and to speed tune them.

You can also farm some speed sets - it is less efficient in terms of xp and gold, but getting 5* speed gear (even white) is a nice starting point to speed-tune your team.

Only your nuker needs optimized gear, the others just need to be faster than your opponent."
RaidShadowLegends,fegr1l5,t1_fegp1yt,1579100521.0,"It's the comp you could use for any and their order, meaning their speeds would have to fit so they act in this specific order.

Apothecary increases the Turn Meter of your whole team.

Spirit Host casts greater Attack buff for the whole team.

Warmaiden casts greater Def break on the enemy team.

Your AOE nuke kills 3-4 of the opposition.

And regarding your second question, there are several options but I'd rather you decide for yourself according to which character you'll be using in other content.

Focusing on Arena isn't for low level accounts as it is a waste of resources for ridiculously low gains. I'd refrain from doing so if I were you as your most important objective for now is to take your team to level 60.

Dunno how? Look on the internet there are dozens of guides for new players."
magicTCG,fegomxn,t3_ep2btr,1579098849.0,"I can only invite you to try the physical version of this game - it's so much more fun when you find great people to play with.

The pre-release events happening this weekend might be the best entry point to any newcomer with a solid understanding of the game's mechanics, so feel free to give it a try if you can.

And now all you have to do is to pass on the legacy and help other people learn the game and get enjoyment out of it!"
