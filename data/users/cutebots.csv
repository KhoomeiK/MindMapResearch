AskReddit,feuujuy,t1_feqxdif,1579390073.0,"I apologize in advance for the really long comment, but it takes quite a bit of time to explain it properly.

To put it simply, a game designer will typically create the basis for the interactive parts of a game by writing a game design document, although depending on genre and the budget they may be involved in the more artistic/programming side as well 

As an example, the creation of chess might've gone something like this

A game designer would come up with the layout, the pieces, how they move, possibly an idea on how they should look, etc. based on what they think will make a fun or good game, then they put those thoughts in a regular document that explains how the game works, making it a game design document.

After this, an artist will create the look of the board based off the document, as well as what they find visually pleasing, without altering the rules of the game itself.

It is very important to note that game design is not the same as programming. A programmer will write code that tells the computer what to make based on the designers wishes, but a programmer doesn't necessarily write anything design related

The most famous game designer would likely be Shigeru Miamoto, creator of Legend Of Zelda as well as Mario. For Mario, he would've likely created the layout, how high Mario jumps relative to his space, the fire flower, the mushroom, the enemies, basically everything that would required a designer to make, he or another game designer came up with it all.

A game designer, whether good or bad is absolutely fundamental to the end result of a game."
