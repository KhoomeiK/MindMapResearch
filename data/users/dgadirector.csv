FilmTVBudgeting,feb2d5m,t1_feaz4z8,1578954826.0,"That’s a side letter (special conditions) to the 2012 IA Basic Agreement. There was also a 2015 BA and, in Oct. 2018, another BA was ratified. It’s not termed a “roll-back.” You’d need to check the 2018 BA to see if there’s anything similar. No mention of what type project is being referred to - it’s not a blanket for all productions.

FilmTVBudgeting,feauszr,t1_fearoq9,1578952371.0,"That makes no sense. A great deal of work goes into hammering out the details of agreements as they’re recalculated every 3-5 years, which generally includes incremental changes for each year. No agreement says you can discard this year’s rate for last year’s. It would be counterproductive. You’d need to obtain a special waiver."

FilmTVBudgeting,feac4h6,t1_fea21c5,1578946862.0,"I’m not familiar with such a rate, however there are several types of projects that are Union but pay lower rates. You’re not talking about which union. I take it you’re a member of whichever one you’re concerned about, so simply call your union. They’ll tell you if it’s authorized or not.

Edit: Or, if you’re asking because of budgeting concerns, again - check with the unions that the production is being shot under. Simple phone calls, but then BCC them on an email confirming so you have a paper trail to cover yourself.

Edit: The DGA does not have any sort of rollback rate. So that’ll possibly save you one call."

I’ve lived in smaller cities (other States), where you could get across town in 10 min. LA isn’t great for public transport. Each time I get in the car I’m looking at at least 20 min. And to get across LA County down into, say, Anaheim, can take 2 1/2 hrs with traffic (getting back at Midnight, cruising at 80, still takes an hour. Lol) You would be more bored in Malibu. Not a lot to do. Not much entertainment. I like live music, comedy, etc. I have to drive into Hollywood or out to Oxnard (Levity Live/The Improv) for that. 30-45 min. The South Bay really isn’t that “touristy.”  Or at least they’re not annoying. It can get packed, though. But a lot of locals."

aww,fdr0sj2,t1_fdqueae,1578677912.0,"Gotcha. Well, Manhattan Beach is wonderful. Totally different from Malibu. So many great little shops and restaurants and The Strand. You have Hermosa Beach, easy LAX access, and you can drive South to Orange County and into San Diego avoiding the LA traffic, since you’re basically South of it already. Love it. But you’re definitely in “the city” more. I live right on the Ventura County side of the LA/Vent border, which I like much better than LA County for the home purchase. Kanan lets me easily get back and forth between the 101 and PCH. I can hit Hollywood and Burbank with ease, which are the areas I need to be most, generally. Or I can come down PCH into Santa Monica and the Marina. If you’re seasonal, hopefully that gives you some guidance into what you best want. You should spend a week or a weekend in each area to get a good feel for them."
