talesfromtechsupport,fgtj4x0,t1_fgth61z,1581105170.0,Good on you. A lot of people don't want to stand up like that and suffer because of it.
talesfromtechsupport,fgt09yq,t1_fgsu6fv,1581096358.0,"He may be one of the few that are salaried. Unfortunately that means he is never ""clocked out""."
nba,fgsygo6,t1_fgrs0r0,1581095270.0,Ok now that is a killer shot.
nba,fgsyb30,t3_f05ldf,1581095175.0,"Man I wish he would put his name in for the dunk contest. He's pretty creative, I would think that he could put something epic together."
nba,fgrk2mp,t1_fgrisd6,1581048825.0,"> And Draymond said the entire team felt that way so if Draymond says the entire team feels that way, and no one speaks up otherwise, or says anything about it what's KD to assume?

The assumption from the whole team is that he's going to bail and leave them high and dry just like he did OKC. That's a KD problem, not a team problem. If anyone needed to clear the air, it's KD, not the people that think he's going to bolt. He talks to 2 people and then clams up for the rest of the year and then bolts. Tell me how the team is in the wrong here? ""Sorry I thought you were going to leave KD. I guess I should have waited until after you left to think such thoughts."" Looks to me like the team was pretty well justified in their thoughts. And yes, I've played on many teams. I'm from a small town so I did everything. Football, basketball, baseball, track, power lifting, and just about anything that was offered. The question is have you been on one? When we had beef, we either talked it out or fought it out. We didn't go spewing it on social media and in interviews for the whole world to see. 

> He didn't bring it up dummy they asked him about it. It's an interview. Is he not supposed to answer something because he's talked about it before?

How bout, ""we talked it out and it was a misunderstanding. Everything was all good after that night. I'd rather keep the details of the conversation private. Next question."" That doesn't seem that hard of a concept to me. But what do I know? I'm borderline autistic apparently."
nba,fgrebe8,t1_fgr87kf,1581044716.0,"> durants take on this one is actually pretty decent

In what way? He wanted the entire team to kiss him at his feet for an issue between him and Draymond. The two talked afterward and Curry came in too. That should have been the end of it, yet here he is bringing it up again."
nba,fgqpbeh,t3_ezsre0,1581028656.0,"The dude seriously feels like the whole world revolves around him. He wants to talk about it, but doesn't want to be the initiator. His solution? Pack up and head to the literal other side of the country."
AskScienceFiction,fgplpsj,t1_fgpiesd,1581007323.0,Won't matter for the magic side. The Trial of the Grasses mutation that he went through sterilized him. That is one that sterilizes 100% of the time for the ones that survive.
AskScienceFiction,fgpljov,t1_fgp3y0k,1581007226.0,It's never mentioned how Geralt was conceived. I always speculated that she had him at a young age and became a sorceress after she gave birth to him which would be the reason she left him to a witcher.
buildapc,fgpkr7z,t3_ezpcl9,1581006768.0,I need some of that luck to rub off on me. Congrats OP. Enjoy.
Conservative,fgog33h,t1_fgo8nht,1580968737.0,"As far as the tariffs go, the idea is to raise taxes on imports to give companies incentive to set up shop in America again. The reason they are in China is because it is cheaper to make items there but if it evens out as far as cost goes, there’s no longer an incentive to stay. There’s already a lot of companies that have begun coming back to America. Amazon, Ford, and IBM are some that I can think of off the top of my head but if you did some googling you could probably see more. Obviously this opens up more jobs for Americans and makes us more self reliant and not reliant on other countries. As for the China tariffs, idk what is being done about that. I’d have to look more into it."
