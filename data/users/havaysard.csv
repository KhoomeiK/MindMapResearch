Anyway, we all have some douchy characteristics. So don't be too harsh on yourself.

You do have a great quality in that you can see and acknowledge your shortcomings. That's something that can not be said about most people out there.

A lot of times, you have to also know other stuff like cultural backgrounds, word plays, proverbs and pop culture stuff to get what the person is saying. Just because you learned the language, doesn't mean you can translate it correctly.  Translating word by word literally is how you get translations that completely miss the mark.

I'll give you an example:

**Guy 1**: What are you doing tonight?'

**Guy 2**: I'm fucking a hot babe tonight.

**Guy 1**: What? You like to have sex with children. I don't like that. That's no good.

It's me. Guy 1 is me! (Read that in Peter's voice!)

This was in the early days of me living in the U.S. I was not yet fully integrated into the culture so I didn't know a lot of sayings and words that have total different meaning in street talk and different contexts.

It took him explaining a bit for me to realize that in that context ""baby"" didn't refer to a literal baby. I was just translating things word by word in my head and wasn't considering cultural references as I didn't know them yet.

worldnews,fec8oeb,t1_fea20cc,1578968597.0,"As an Iranian, I would like nothing more than the dam finally breaking. Unfortunately, over the past 40 years, we have had many unrest that lead to nowhere expect imprisonment and death of hundreds and thousands of brave Iranians. 

Having said, things are definitely changing in a different way. For example, having people shout Death to Dictator (""مرگ بر دیکتاتور"") in the streets, clearly pointing at the supreme leader or a news anchor of stat's propaganda machine saying ""I have lied to you for 13 years on behalf of the regime"" is unheard of. 10-20 years ago, these things would get you killed or at the very least sent to Evin to not be seen or heard from ever, instantly. But now just having enough room to say things like that is huge. Don't get me wrong, they still put protesters in prison and/or kill them, but with the world watching through social media, it's getting a tiny bit harder. They have to at least hide it somewhat.

I sincerely hope, we get our country and freedom back soon. Way too many of our people have been murdered at the hands of this regime. 

Iranians are also a little wary of revolution. The 1979 revolution had so many supporters. There were different groups, Communists, Socialist, Seculars and everyday people who just were tired of shah's crap. But Khomeini and his people were quick to take over the media and the army and started slaughtering everyone who wasn't 100% on their side. That's why the older generation of Iranians are very cautious about another revolution. I hope when it happens, we get a totally democratic elected government that values individual freedom and let our country and its people flourish and not just be known as a terrorist nation and that place where the mullahs took 52 Americans hostage."

As a fan of Tony I want to believe it. And it would be true vs almost everybody else, but the kind of pressure Khabib puts on you, will drain your gas tank much faster than most people.

Just to confirm and add to what  [alifeiliMD](https://www.reddit.com/user/alifeiliMD/) said, the regime's propaganda has never worked on regular everyday Iranians. Even in a suffocating information blackhole of 20-30 years ago, people never believed their propaganda.

It is sad that in a country where the idea of Human Rights started and was spread (by Cyrus) millions of people don't have basic human rights.

To piggyback on what [alifeiliMD](https://www.reddit.com/user/alifeiliMD/) said above, most Iranians hate that ""death to America"" nonsense. There may be a small percentage of non-supporters who are actually forced to participate in demonstrations, otherwise, they will lose their jobs, home or worse jailed or killed.

I should know, they used to force us to demonstrate on the streets in support of the regime. I remember, one time a bunch of us refused. They threatened us, verbally and physically abused us and kicked us out of school for weeks. We were a bunch of middle schoolers. Imagine what they do to adults!

The truth is, most people, regardless of where they live, are good. They just want to live a peaceful life. Unfortunately, our ""leaders"" have other ideas.

As a now proud American citizen, I beg my fellow Americans to please go and vote. We have the power to change things in this country. People in Iran and many other countries don't. Please don't take it for granted.

I also wanted to tell the Iraqis, I am so sorry that your country, your people and your children are in the middle of this. You guys have been suffering for 40 years. First was the 8-year senseless war between our countries where over a million people had to die because two dictators (Ok, and the CIA) got a hard on for each other. Then was the Irag invasion and war that is still killing people. On top of that, you had to deal with Saddam for years.

I am so happy this is somehow settled for now and we don't have to lose thousands of lives on both sides.  It is fucking 2020. Why can't we all just get along?
