Could be useful if you find the Ohms still a bit harsh even after an amp upgrade. It's reasonably pricey at around $400USD new but I've been very happy with mine. It's great at removing digital glare and warming up the sound, it's got 3 different tube settings, a bass booster and a soundstage expander, all of which work well. You'd need to have an integrated amp with pre out/main in jacks on the back (or a separate pre amp and power amp) to use it with both your turntable and laptop otherwise you could just use it with your laptop. It's a little pricey but maybe you can find one second hand."

vintageaudio,ffr1kkd,t1_ffqzlj6,1580148444.0,"The Ohms themselves are rated down to 42hz so they have a reasonable amount of low end. Perhaps before buying a sub you should look into buying the Model L upgraded woofer and vent adapter kit from Ohm: https://ohmspeaker.com/legacy-products/l/#upgrade

> The OHM L upgraded woofer kits offer smoother transition to the low tweeter and use a new foam surround that is projected to last up to 30 years that will allow for more clarity on female voices. The FerroFluid cooling handles the thermo transients from CDs.

>Tighter and deeper bass is heard with the addition of a SubBass Activator (SBA) and vent adapter. The SBA eliminates the drive below the speaker's natural response to reduce distortion and clean up the deep bass. The vent adapter tunes the cabinet to work with the SBA and new woofers for deeper bass response.

A new crossover is also only $65 but it would be even cheaper to recap it yourself if you're comfortable with soldering. [Here's a thread with people discussing a Model L recap](https://audiokarma.org/forums/index.php?threads/ohm-speaker-restoration.457196/). You should get a reasonable performance upgrade from them if you do that.

As for an amp, what are you currently using? Whatever it is though for $35 it can't be that good. Check your local craigslist, gumtree, facebook marketplace daily for integrated amps and see what comes up. Amps come up for sale all the time and it shouldn't take long to find something with a bit more juice. Obviously tubes are going to help if you feel like the speakers are a bit bright but that will probably be out of your price range at the moment and a decent solid state amp is still going to sound better than the $35 amazon one and may even fix the harshness problem.  

See what you can find in your price range and cross check prices on hifishark.com sold listings to see if the price is good value or not. Im a big fan of vintage NAD gear, especially their amps with the power envelope tech. It’s usually cheap and as long as you avoid one with dry solder issues then they’re usually great value as well. I’ve always found them to sound very musical, I’ve got a 7400 integrated in my bedroom and an 1155 pre in a different set up. What is your main source, a laptop or a turntable etc?"

* What are you looking to upgrade, the amp, the speakers or both?

* Ideally would you like to keep these speakers and hopefully have them sound better with a different amp and some restoration like a recap or are you more leaning towards a new set?
 
* What kind of budget are you working with?
 
* What size room do you have or what speaker form factor are you after; bookshelves, towers, large cabinets etc.
 
* What kind of music do you mostly listen to? Acoustic, classical, jazz, rock, electronic, hip hop etc?

However if the date gets changed can we expect a complete end to Australia day protests and a full embracement of the national celebration day without further complaint or using the day as a soapboxing platform and guilting those who choose to celebrate over the actions of governments past and present which they may not have necessarily voted for? I have my doubts..."

> 21 minutes, 12 seconds.
> 
> This number is your one chance to save yourself from the disasterphe that is the Oreimo ending. Once you reach this point in the final episode of the OVAs, stop the playback and end it right there. So long as you do, it provides a perfectly solid conclusion to the series with no cop outs or asspulls, and the rest of the story can easily be left to your imagination. If you are a glutton for punishment however, proceed at your own risk. Know that what you see cannot be unseen though. Trust me on this one, take the blue pill and stay in wonderland Neo."

After seeing so many animes where the brother/sister pairing is teased at but never gets close to happening I was honestly shocked when it actually went that way but that final 2 minutes of garbage where he agrees to break up with her after systematically crushing literally every other girl in his harem just made no sense and was completely unnecessary, if you're going to have them get together then fucking own it, don't go through all that just for him to end up with noone for the sake of trying to keep things vaguely PG!<"

Of course that’s the other end of the extreme but in between “cop enters house for no reason and shoots children inside” and “hero cop dies saving persons life” there are thousands of officers that do their job normally. It’s just that “Police officer goes to work every day without major incident” doesn’t make the news. You only get the evil cops and the hero cops making headlines and you forget about everyone in between depending on which narrative the media wants to focus on that day."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fffk360,t1_fffii60,1579885668.0,As a civilian there's a difference between you deliberately shooting someone in the face and shooting someone unintentionally. That's why different charges manslaughter and murder exist. When did I say he wasn't responsible? I'm not defending him or his actions I was simply pointing out that there is a big difference between the two things and the post title implies intention on the cops behalf or at best is deliberately ambiguous by cutting off the article text and allowing you to assume the worst. I'd just like the facts without important details omitted thanks.
