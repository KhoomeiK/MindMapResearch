It’s a pretty reasonable ask, but I understand not wanting to deal with that accommodation, particularly when it’s something as trivial as cooking dinner. I’m bad at planning and having the responsibility of giving a heads up for something that I don’t plan would give me a lot of anxiety. Then, it’s on me if I mess it up and my plans change,"

Is he stressed about the hours he’s working? Does he express exhaustion from working 2 jobs? I know you said he chooses his hours but it sounds like he works 2 physically and mentally taxing jobs and I’d personally be very stressed with just that. If he seems to be managing fine, NTA. If he is too stressed to work in regular out of state visits, NAH."
AmItheAsshole,ffeeea6,t3_et5zf9,1579844903.0,"ESH. What your sister did sucks, and you have every right to be angry and decide to keep her toxicity out of her life. However, your reaction towards her and the rest of the family didn’t have to be so hostile. Addiction is a monster and your sister is probably in a lot of pain, along with your family trying to cope with it. You haven’t made anything easier."

Your sensitivity is causing the inconvenience, so it’s not up to him to comply, that’s just the nature of co-habitating. I also hate the smell of bacon, but if that’s what he eats around that time you’ll have to figure out how to deal."
Shoestring,ffbeeb4,t3_esj055,1579761727.0,"Museums:
-The High (main museum, cultural/historic art)
-MLK center 
-civil rights museum 
-Bodies exhibit (niche, if you’re into biology/health/etc.)

Shops/eateries:
-ponce city market (an Atlanta staple)
-Krog street market (kind of like a mini ponce)
-westside provisions (more spread out conglomeration of great food and bars)
-Inman park village (on the belt line, similar to westside)
-little five points (grungy area with very unique shops)

Scenic views/walks/nature:
Atlanta is pretty green, the main scenery you’ll get in the city is Piedmont park or the beltline. One more hidden spot is the Goat Farm, kinda hard to explain what it is but it’s worth a google. You can travel a bit out for Stone Mountain or sweetwater creek state park, or if you really want to venture out, there are tons of beautiful spots in the north GA mountains. A few I’ve been to are tallulah gorge, cloudland canyon, and Vogel state park/blood mountain.

Social gaming:
-Painted duck (really hot spot with unique games)
-Joystick (arcade bar in edgewood) 
-Ormsbys (another bar w fun games)
-ponce city market (rooftop has ski ball, mini golf, etc)

Roofs:
-Clermont Hotel (bar)
-New Realm (brewery)
-ponce city market (see above)
(none of these are particularly fancy)
-sundial restaurant (fancy restaurant at the top of a skyscraper, I believe isn’t outdoors though)

Interesting bars:
-8arm
-midcity cafe 
-cafe intermezzo (pretentious dessert spot)
-sister louisa’s
-Noni’s
-MJQ Wednesdays 
-Monday night brewing 

Clubs:
-tongue and groove 
-Havana club
-the sound table

My personal must go eat is Barcelona Wine Bar and Bartaco (they’re sister restaurants, both small plate style) 
Some other goodies: two urban licks, staplehouse, optimist, cypress street pint and plate, Einstein’s, fritti, antico, ladybird"

dating_advice,fej38n9,t3_ep8x47,1579155235.0,"I met this guy my freshman year of college and we hit it off so well, it was like we were handmade for each other, and the feeling was mutual. We got together right before the summer. He ended up leaving that summer, and since we’d really just begun dating, we fizzled out (I didn’t expect this after our amazing first month, but I digress). Fall rolls around and both of us get into serious relationships with other people. Two and a half years later we both break it off with our SOs, so I decide to ask him out again to fix The One That Got Away feeling. All of that chemistry was completely gone. Very sad."

vegan,fehe5o1,t3_ep653a,1579114688.0,"Hunting is a very different story from the traditional western meat eating regime, but a big aspect of the vegan community is the idea that humans shouldn’t be consuming the flesh of another animal just based on our physiology (albeit among other reasons). So as far as hunting goes for sustenance, the vegan ideals aren’t aligned. On top of that, hunting for sport when not needed for sustenance is inhumane and would again not align with vegan ideals. As far as hunting purely for population control, I haven’t read much into the benefits of hunting for that, but from my perspective that in of itself is not as misaligned with the vegan ideals as compared to hunting to eat or for sport. I believe this because the basis for vegan ideals is the lack of necessity to take an animals life, but if the ecosystem would benefit from that animal dying, it could be considered or argued a necessary act."

The plan was at first to walk the 3 miles to the hospital, half way there we gave up and ordered. Think it was even an Uber pool. Maybe it is a lot to ask of someone, but you had other priorities and the driver overreacted."

I lived in Ireland for a few months and to me the cities had a lot less to offer than the countryside. It’s a pretty small island so you could rent a car or take busses around and it only takes a couple hours to get from one coast to the other. One thing is you could take a trip up to Belfast to see Giants Causeway!"
