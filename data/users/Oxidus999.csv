IncelsWithoutHate,ffqh0ab,t1_ffqgpwk,1580134336.0,You are clearly delusional. Michael Jordan managed to impact the ACTUAL whole world thanks to his fashion brand. Kobe? With the exception of basketball fans (majority of them live in USA) not many people have known about him. Many people are finding about him just because of his death.

And from what I know, they started some work on Myth update already in 2016 and who knows how much they progressed. I believe that the Dwarf Bros can surprise us. Well there is not much else to do other than believe and wait anyways."
