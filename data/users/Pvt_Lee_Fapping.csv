Overwatch,ffxja27,t1_ffwum7p,1580326266.0,"I've found that he's best for denying heals if the enemy has a Bap or Ana; also for playing ""containment"" when the enemy team has a Torb turret - just jump onto the healer/turret, drop the bubble, and do your best to eliminate them. He's more of a situational character; not a jack-of-all-trades by any means."
Overwatch,ffxf4mv,t1_ffwgjed,1580323881.0,"You absolutely can do that as Zarya; I've done it before and I always save my bubble-share for that very reason. If I hear the melody, somebody's getting a bubble after I see them get lifted up."

>  Scott Z. Burns brought up the idea of producing a medical thriller film depicting the rapid spread of a virus, which was inspired by various pandemics such as the 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2009 flu pandemic, and seems to cover a Hendra virus-like threat. To devise an accurate perception of a pandemic event, Burns consulted with representatives of the World Health Organization as well as noted medical experts such as W. Ian Lipkin and Lawrence ""Larry"" Brilliant.

AskReddit,ffv0kmh,t1_ffuoeq1,1580252936.0,"Maybe they got some bad info from an apparent expert. I'm one of those people who believes the term ""break"" means multiple pieces and ""fractured"" means ""cracked, but not in multiple pieces"" because that's how it was presented to me by a professor of human anatomy with multiple doctorates. I don't know if she got it wrong, and without a contradictory source to what she said I have no reason to believe otherwise."
Showerthoughts,ffsdj8d,t1_ffsbm63,1580179110.0,Not if President Bolsonaro has anything to say about it.
videos,ffrw6mt,t1_ffrngun,1580167237.0,Thanks but I already said that it is about pirates and thieves; I've just always seen the other guy as being the thief.
LV426,ffrvsf5,t1_ffrqvlf,1580166973.0,"Aliens have heat-resistant exo-skeletons that can remain intact after being submerged in boiling lead - combine that with the pressurized blood and that means there *will* be some acid to contend with. The saber could be hot enough to cauterize any wounds, but the cauterizing effect probably wouldn't be fast enough to seal the wounds before some blood would spray out.

Ninja Edit: in fact, it *definitely isn't* fast enough because in the original trilogy there was always blood spatter after a lightsaber lopped off a limb."
videos,ffrjddd,t1_ffr4zh8,1580159209.0,"Not to detract from the real issue here, but I always interpreted the roles in this comic as reversed: the grimace on his face in the last panel always suggested to me that he's the OP and the realization hits them: ""He said he made this, but it looked so familiar to me... now that I've looked at it, I see that I was right - this *is* something that I made a long time ago, but he didn't realize I'm the one who made it."""
CampfireCooking,ffqnzu6,t3_euknqz,1580139580.0,"Bad idea. [Monumentally stupid idea.](https://bestoutdoorfirepits.com/can-use-river-rocks-build-fire-pit/)

If the fire is hot enough and the rocks have water trapped inside (which they do; they're literally in a stream), the heat will cause the rocks to expand and burst. Props on the engineering and ingenuity, but don't overthink it; just turn the spit yourself."
TipOfMyRooster,ffqm4pd,t1_ffphxhr,1580138270.0,Yep; that was it. It was a sponsored video by Tide and Gav gave Dan a new lab coat just to have it thrashed. [Dan storms off right after the hand-off.](https://youtu.be/Rz37I23NT9s?t=25)
perfectlycutscreams,ffqjud8,t1_ffq4q1u,1580136577.0,"It's hugely active. The front page of /r/overwatch always has something new each time I view it. Not just that, but Blizzard still has upcoming plans for it: if you hadn't heard about [Overwatch 2](https://overwatch2.playoverwatch.com/en-us/trailer) and how the multiplayer for it works, then I'm genuinely surprised."
Overwatch,ffnoup6,t1_ffmcevr,1580068713.0,"She tossed it when Genji was facing her, but it takes time for the ult to spool up; by the time Genji deflected Mei's drone, she had moved and was standing behind him. Just play the video again and keep pausing-unpausing until you see the frame with Genji facing Mei holding the drone in her hand."
Overwatch,ffno0zm,t1_ffl3672,1580068376.0,"Mei's little snowball drone counts as a projectile, which means it can be countered by D.Va, Genji, and Sigma (unless I'm forgetting someone). D.Va can use defense matrix to pop the drone as its deployed, Sigma can use kinetic grasp to absorb the drone, and here we've seen Genji deflect the drone."
