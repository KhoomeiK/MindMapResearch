worldnews,fgn9swu,t1_fgn86mj,1580940409.0,"That's a good question.

The reason that Mosaddegh was considered such a threat was because he was incredibly popular in Iran, especially with the Shah's enemies. There were ongoing assassinations and assassination attempts against people loyal to the Shah and calls for assassinations of the Shah. There were groups that would riot and protest and try to disrupt life in the cities as much as possible in support of Mosaddegh.

&#x200B;

Mosaddegh  also had the support of many of the clerics who were enemies of the Shah. These clerics used their platforms to call for the Shah to be removed/stripped of his power. (This is why Ayatollah Khomeini was exiled from Iran, because he was one of the clerics who used his platform to call for the removal of the Shah)

&#x200B;

Basically, Mosaddegh used his popular support to try to strip power from the Shah and give that power to himself. That was at the same time that the CIA stepped in and helped the Shah get rid of him.

&#x200B;

The Shah needed the US, the UK and the CIA because he needed their money and protection. He relied on that money to maintain his army, and his government. Iran had the  potential to be rich, but it was going to take a lot of foreign capital to be invested in Iran for that to happen."
worldnews,fgn5re6,t1_fgn3shu,1580938233.0,"That's not true. I spent a semester writing a paper on the Islamic Revolution for my master's degree in political science. He was not a figurehead. He was in charge of the army, the secret police, the courts, and a lot of the finances. He was a dictator before and after the CIA coup that helped him get rid of the prime minister. He came to power by overthrowing his own father in a coup just after WWII. A dictator is not a figurehead. 

People also seem to forget that the coup to get rid of the prime minister happened 26 years before the Islamic Revolution. It was one out of many factors that caused the revolution. It wasn't the sole reason like many people today seem to think.

Edit: 

The CIA coup definitely gave him even more power, but he was not comparable to today's European monarchs. He was the head of state. He is more comparable to today's Supreme Leader of Iran and Mosaddegh is more comparable to today's president of Iran.

Edit 2: 

People also don't ever seem to bring up the fact that Prime Minister Mosaddegh was in the middle of his own coup against the Shah, when the US+Shah coup took him out of power. Mosaddegh was trying to consolidate power for himself by trying to take powers away from the Shah. The whole thing was not cut and dry by any means."

worldnews,fe5stzv,t1_fe5rap7,1578874181.0,"Well that's really  100% not true. The Shah was never in exile, unless you are thinking of his father. The Shah Reza Pahlavi was not a figurehead, he was the king of Iran. This wasn't like the current British monarchy. He was the main decision maker in the country. He controlled the military, the police, the secret police. He controlled the finances. He controlled public projects and was the one who created the White Revolution.  

His reign was uninterrupted from the time he took power just after WW2 until the Islamic Revolution. 

When he lost power, it ended 2500 years of Iran being ruled by monarchs

worldnews,fe5kbfu,t1_fe5eor3,1578870475.0,"""The place used to be pretty moderate and almost progressive before this happened.""

Parts of the place (major cities) used to be moderate and almost progressive because the Shah, who was the one supported by the US and the UK, was very pro-West.

The majority of the country was still pretty rural and extremely conservative. It was rare for people to leave the village where they were born. It was basically a serfdom outside of the big cities. Land owners were in control over the peasants.

&#x200B;

There is a lot more to the overthrow of the Shah than just the simplistic ""CIA coup""

&#x200B;

It involved the religious leaders, the land barons, the communists, and the merchants all having their own reasons to want to overthrow the Shah.

The religious leaders wanted to overthrow the Shah because he was giving women rights, which was a threat to the Islamic religion and Iranian family structure.

The land barons wanted to overthrow the Shah because he was attempting to modernize the country by redistributing land to the peasants, so they wouldn't be forced to work for the land barons.

The communists wanted to overthrow him because he wasn't a communist, and he oppressed them pretty hard.

The merchants wanted to overthrow him because they thought his modernization policies would hurt them and the traditional power they wielded.

Also, he was definitely a dictator to those who didn't support his modernization plans for Iran, or who seemed like they could be a threat to him.
