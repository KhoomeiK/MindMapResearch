askscience,ffgrcu2,t3_et8f6v,1579913100.0,"I’m sure someone smarter in a specialized field has a better answer but I think it matters on a few things. Some how they isolate inactive proteins/DNA/pieces of the virus/bacteria. Dead/inactive and can’t physically make you ill. And then put it into an injectable compound. This allows it to be put in your body without making you ill and your immune system can make antibodies therefore learning how to kill it when it’s exposed to the real deal. 

I believe this tends to work with virus/bacteria that don’t mutate. Hence why there’s no vaccine for HIV/AIDS, I read once that the HIV virus mutates. Scientists (somehow) can see the different lineages of the HIV virus. Like if two people were infected by the same person, they’d all have the same genetic HIV, which would be different than 3 people infected by a different person. 

It’s been 10 years since I took Microbio and Parvo but that’s my basic understanding of it."

I’m not even sad anymore that we’re over, I’m mad about the time, effort and love I wasted. And I tried relentlessly to end things and get away, MULTIPLE times. He wouldn’t have it. It was manipulation and narcissism at its finest. I’ve never experienced anything like it. 

Instead of being sad that I’m fucking single and at this point, for a very long time, I’m just over it. It was a toxic relationship and I’m just happy I finally got out of it. It all gets better.

relationship_advice,fdc7z0a,t3_ekchvl,1578268876.0,"Something to think about: Are you sure she had the abortion? She could have decided to not do it and wants to raise the baby on her own. Using the abortion story as a reason to end the relationship and a way to sever ties and raise the baby on her own. She wanted a baby, maybe just not with you (it happens).

I’m not sure how to address this as you can’t communicate with her but it’s your baby, too if she decided to keep it. Also you don’t want a surprise child support summons in 5 years for a child you didn’t think existed.

I’d also like to add that I’ve been in a similar predicament. Accident happened 3 months into dating someone. At fucking 29. I had made it so long without that happening. Complete “Ooops, oh shit.” At that age and at that point, I wanted to keep it. He did not. He adamantly did not. Which fine, whatever. I was ok with wanting to do it alone, financially and mentally. I knew I could. Not even looking for child support or whatever. Just wanted the baby. Didn’t meant for it to happen but since it did, that’s how I felt about it at that time. 

Well he begged/pleaded/cried for me to not do that to him....don’t have a baby that he didn’t want. Don’t have a baby he’s not forced to partake in (since he didn’t want the baby and I said I’d do it alone, wasn’t going to do the child support/custody mess), or “force him into being an unprepared dad” (at 33). He didn’t want the baby to exist period. 

Well long story short, he convinced me to do it. I had my mind made up to keep it and I let him get to me. I’m not sure if I regret the abortion as much as I regret the loss of it being my choice. In the end, it didn’t feel like my choice. It feel like what he wanted my choice to be. 

The point to all of this, regardless of her doing it or not, it’s a monumental, life changing decision. And she needs to decide on it. It never leaves you."
