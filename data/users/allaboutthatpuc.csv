AskReddit,fdgy0o7,t1_fdgwh0i,1578411105.0,I agree. It's almost like admin finally caught on that maybe the professional emergency dispatcher should be the one deciding what an emergency is. ðŸ™„
AskReddit,fdgvzuk,t1_fdguzsl,1578409704.0,For sure. We actually stopped asking it. We now ask what your issue is no matter how busy and the. The dispatcher determines if you can hold.
AskReddit,fdgpcz8,t1_fdgp1pz,1578404753.0,"Very important advice! If you get impaled, don't pull out the object!"
AskReddit,fdgfy7b,t3_el4ev3,1578395021.0,"I've taken many legit emergencies on the non-emergency line. Most memorable was a lady who shot her husband and just called us to ""collect the body.""

What always shocked me was when it was busy and I would ask, ""is this an emergency or can you hold?"" People would always say they could hold but then have legit emergencies. Like, no your stab wound cannot hold. 

I often found that in shock people tend to get hyper focused on one detail and leave out vital ones."
