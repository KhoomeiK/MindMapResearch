What is bad is when she is right and I tell her I need to look at the medical research and talk to my doctor first.  Once u get the clear, she uses that as proof that everything she suggests is right.  She once berated me until I listened to a health conference she was following.

She said they don't all have to be right but I argued that they were all approved for the same conference which casts doubt on all of them.  Rich white women with too much time."

My mom has too much time on her hands and atone point thought she was allergic to most fruits and veggies, meat, and gluten.  She would complain when I cooked that I didn't make the food to her strict specifications (then I would see her eating strawberries she is actually allergic to ""only till my throat itches"" but that is another story). I guess that makes her a choosy beggar.  She kept trying to place a burden on me so I get the frustration and I would have done the same thing.
