30PlusSkinCare,ff9jozz,t3_ese6f6,1579714447.0,I got a brief bout of perioral dermatitis from a Neutragena sunscreen and it must've been the oxybenzone in it because I've never had any other reaction like that to lots of sunscreens and that was the first time I used oxybenzone. Took a month to fully clear

socialanxiety,ferg427,t1_feresne,1579353473.0,"Yeah it just depends, some people are more in tune with it regardless of knowing the official diagnosis/terminology"
socialanxiety,ferbpv5,t1_fer9bap,1579352125.0,"I just said that you'd have to hope an adult would pick up on the signs, but at the end of the day not everybody knows about social anxiety and not everyone is a psychologist. I think that if someone is clearly uncomfortable in social settings I think a less confronting approach should be taken. If you baby a student too much though, that's also embarrassing. I think it's just finding that middle ground. I've had a meltdown at work and the manager talked to me for a few minutes and was supportive and let me be upset for 5-10 mins, but also said that she really needed me at work right now and to just do something that didn't involve the customers. It was a good balance and i guess for me personally that's an example of discreet exposure, instead of just sending me home. Idk"
socialanxiety,fer8975,t1_fer31a0,1579351026.0,"I think at that stage You'd just have to hope a parent or teacher would pick up if a child is showing signs of social anxiety, because it is hard to distinguish it from being shy or an introvert. Another comment mentioned teachers should be taught about conditions like this so they know how to deal with it when they see it which I think is a good approach. I realised I had social anxiety at around 14 i think but that's because of the internet with sites and organisations that make mental health information easily available nowadays. There's improvement in that sense"
socialanxiety,feq02fy,t3_eq9aem,1579335372.0,"I think exposure therapy should be done by teachers in a lot more discreet way that helps take some of the anxiety from the person dealing with SA. Like if you are trying to help someone with SA, make it discreet and not obvious so you don't humiliate them, humiliation worsens the problem."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fejkv6v,t1_fejk7qy,1579178309.0,"Can also be stress , which in that case means a whole other journey haha. I've heard that hair loss can actually show up a few months AFTER a stressful event , might be something to do with the hair follicle phase? Not sure. But it really doesn't look bad, hopefully the derm appointment goes well and they'll obviously be a lot more helpful :)"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fejhf6v,t3_epg5cb,1579174379.0,"I don't think it could hurt to take a multivitamin, at least until you get some bloodwork to see if your hair loss could be explained by things like iron or vitamin d deficiency etc etc. Even though you are under a lot of stress, try your hardest to eat nutritious food (if you're not already) and also eat enough calories so if you're on a strict diet for example, i'd put that on hold until you get this under control. Eat enough fats (you can add extra virgin olive oil to salads and your meals and it's an easy way to get fat in your diet) and proteins. At the end of the day i'm no doctor so this advice may or may not help depending on what is causing the hair loss. I hope you're okay. Could also be hormonal, some people get hair loss after stopping hormonal birth control for example. Btw it doesn't look that bad!"
30PlusSkinCare,feiwlbn,t1_feiw649,1579149195.0,Yup for me I apparently had some eczema as a kid and I had a very very minor amount during highschool and since last year it has increased a lot but no identifiable changes I can put my finger on :/ So many variables that can come into play tho like hormones environment stress allergies etc It sucks
30PlusSkinCare,feivozy,t1_feiv4ld,1579148491.0,"Burning could've been from being sensitive to something else as well , some sunscreens can do that to me or when my skin is sensitive to something else but idk I actually stopped using face wash (except if i wear makeup) and use warm water and i feel like my skin is stronger in a way plus im using tretinoin so i think it evens out. If i wasn't using any actives id probably using an oil cleanser or something. But yeah hopefully you figure it out ! I had the worst outbreak of eczema on my forehead for like 1-2 months and honestly as weird as it sounds it started when i was taking fish oil and stopped when i stopped taking it so idk Reactions are weird"
30PlusSkinCare,feiufmo,t3_ep3b73,1579147508.0,"I think it might be better to use a cleanser without fragrance because I've heard you can develop irritation long term from it like months or a year of use , but that's if fragrance is an issue, might not be. I just avoid fragrance cuz it means one less variable
Edit: LRP is usually fragrance free ? I think so maybe ignore my comment if you still reacted to it"
eczema,fe82w08,t3_eo358c,1578921862.0,"Yup and when you scratch in your sleep there's no holding yourself back, whereas i can limit my damage scratching when im awake. Asleep i have no concept of whether my skin is raw etc"

AmItheAsshole,fct3jn6,t1_fct2nsq,1577931953.0,"That's where I can't give anymore judgements, cause we don't know anything about this guy. If he was otherwise an amazing husband who just cares a lot about his work and made this
mistake? I think there's room for forgiveness or understanding. If he hasn't been a supportive husband/slacking off in many areas of his marriage then I think it's different and if he isn't supportive of his wife in general then it's possible he doesn't give much  detail about her hardships to his coworkers and maybe doesn't get that personal with them anyway. If so then it's likely he downplayed the severity of her being in labour. He definitely made mistakes but I think it also depends on his patterns of behaviour, whether this was a one-off thing or a continuous cycle that she finally got fed up with on this day"
AmItheAsshole,fct0l7m,t1_fcqq0m3,1577929775.0,"It sucks for the friend who lost their grandpa and the wife who was in a high risk labour without emotional support. I'm not saying it sucks for OP but I don't think what he did suddenly makes him this terrible evil person who doesn't deserve one ounce of empathy. I think in the context of Australia having absolutely devastating fires with 5,000,000 ha burnt and understaffed and dangerous which is why he made the call to stay back, he deserves some empathy for that and it truly is mayhem he aint lying. In terms of him letting his friend go instead of him, I have a feeling he did not explain to his friend the risks that his wife has experienced multiple times and that this birth was not like any normal birth, and therefore he didn't make a good case for himself if he wanted to work out which one should get to go. Perhaps he didn't because he wanted an excuse to stay back further, sure. Or he felt obligated because generally people see death as more important than a birth in terms of it being the last time to say goodbye and etc which is true. However he didn't explain the high risks his wife has which could lead to the death of his baby AGAIN (happened previously) so I do think he made a mistake there. Edit: Another huge mistake he made was not calling or even texting her, unless signal was bad in the fire-affected area however he didn't mention that so I doubt it"
AmItheAsshole,fcp9h3q,t1_fcoyoy7,1577855090.0,"I'm just saying that there should be a little bit of understanding as to him staying back. I doubt he could've foreseen that his friend would have a crisis on such a similar scale, being tough and kinda difficult to assess on which is more 'worthy' of leaving work. He might not have felt comfortable telling someone whos grandpa is about to die that he wants to leave instead of them despite his emergency being on a similar scale and maybe he didn't explain the dangers of his wife's pregnancies enough to make a good case for himself which is where he made the mistake. We don't know how his friend reacted, whether she was in tremendous emotional pain or shock, or perhaps she wasn't much at all we don't know. Anyway I think it's safe to assume he wasn't planning on staying back that long and might've made it for the birth but was unexpectedly presented with the dilemma of having his friend have an emergency too. It's just a sucky situation for everyone but this case is also a bit different due to the nature of his work. I'm not saying he's not an asshole, he could've left when his shift ended but I'm assuming it was genuinely mayhem like he said and understaffed so felt obligated to stay back a little longer to help. But to be fair, just because he's a firefighter doesn't suddenly mean he's a great person, we don't know.
Edit: she was apparently devastated so I take back me saying that she 'wasn't much at all we don't know"""
AmItheAsshole,fcm90gq,t1_fcm3wuv,1577767475.0,"I don't think people understand how catastrophic some of the Australian fires are at the moment. A lot of firefighters here are volunteers and understaffed. Currently in threat of having to potentially evacuate due to the Currowan fire which is 227080 ha and out of control. And there are plenty of other fires and the smoke is everywhere. I don't think it's as simple as 'my shift has ended so I can go'. Don't think I'll comment on the Grandpa dying vs birth that has a chance of death but potentially not Because I don't think there is one right answer. I think a lot of the commentors aren't Australian and might not understand how much we need the help of firefighters right now.
Edit: op said in a comment that he is in Australia"
eczema,fcm13rf,t3_ehw6cu,1577761488.0,"I had a huge flare up of eczema on my forehead and I couldn't pin point why, well I had started taking fish oil around that same time (i have taken it on and off in the past but not a lot) and I tried to look into it but I couldn't find anything that would explain it. I've stopped taking it obviously and i haven't had a flare up since. I thought it was from tretinoin which i also started at that time but I had no reactions anywhere to it and my skin was fine using it, and It's gone now despite continued tretinoin use. I also have gotten dishydrotic eczema on my hands so idk"
