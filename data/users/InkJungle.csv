The fix is to evolve, skip gen & find new hominoids to repopulate which just feels cheaty & annoying when I had a full healthy group but a female or 2 stopped following at random somewhere & I can't find them.

There are most certainly limitations & different levels of intelligence, even amongst individuals of the same species let alone all species of animal.

Luckily my ex was right beside me, ""comforting"" me in the fact that this kid, a fucking child like 8 or 10 years old is fully aware she can manipulate strangers with sexual lies & that it was regular behaviour, they all know she's lying & don't worry... 

Ever since then I've worried. 
Not actively, but I'll immediately eject myself from most scenarios that involve a lone stranger, specifically females, kids & teens.

The thing that got to me the most was that I obviously knew I was innocent, everyone in the room knew I was innocent, my reaction came from innocence but I still have no doubt in my mind that my on the spot reaction would have likely appeared guilty in a room full of strangers.

I'm just trying to point out they're not a small terrorist group running around in the middle eastern desert with bazookas like every second American seems to think.

Go eat a snickers, you sound hangry."
