The bad? Oh boy...

My girlfriend of a year and a half broke up with me

My dog who saved my life passed away (old age but still...)

I badly hurt my back (herniated disc) and couldn't do much of anything for 3 months, harming my studies and ensuring I couldn't go home for the holidays

Had to go to the ER multiple times, once experiencing so much pain I thought I was dying (on my birthday too...)

Had to commute 5 hours per day (every weekday for a little over a month) for a mandatory job by my university course program

Theres probably more bad stuff, but these are the top

Hopes for next year? 

Not get injured/sick

Do well in classes

Have a relationship with someone ambitious, intelligent, and beautiful

Make more money so I can do nice things for my family and others"

Do you drink soda? If yes, stop

Do you meal prep? If no, start

Do you eat enough vegetables/fruits? If no, start

Do you count calories? If no, start

As an athelete you should aim for .7-1g of protein per lb of body weight.

Also, skinny-fat means either two things. That your abdominal muscles haven't hypertrophied enough to start being visible/defined. Or that you actually just have an excess of fat and underestimating are underestimating it.

From what I've seen personally, climbers who are climbing 7c-8a onward and are ""skinnyfat"" are typically climbers who haven't had their abs hypertrophy enough. Climbers who are ""skinnyfat"" and climbing below this grade tend to be climbers with excessive bodyfat and underestimate how much bodyfat they have

I would also advise against seeing a nutritionist, because the qualifications for that are basically nonexistent. If you want to change things with professional help, see a dietician.

That's my two cents"

Taking notes (as another poster said)

Reading out loud (recording yourself reading it so you can play it back later to yourself can also be helpful)

Split it into manageable chunks and summarize it in your head (ie. Read a paragraph, then mentally state to yourself a summary of it)

And lastly my favorite - speed read. Read a page/paragraph/sentence as a whole and use your own knowledge to fill in gaps (ie. Read all the ""non duplicate"" words then use context to fill out the sentence to yourself, if that makes sense). Can cause mistakes though."
