NintendoSwitchDeals,ff3fjsh,t3_er0kv3,1579540028.0,"I REALLY want this, but I don't see me having the dedication to playing through one of these, let alone two :("
nextfuckinglevel,ff3f7cb,t3_er5i5w,1579539832.0,That ... fucking ... smile.  This girl just made my heart grow three sizes today.
NintendoSwitch,fekq9uc,t1_fekiy3p,1579205376.0,"I've seen rumors about Arkham coming; makes sense at least for the Asylum and City games.  Not sure on Dead Island (though I'd LOVE to see Dying Light come to the Switch).  I'd give up one of my kids for Dead Space, but since EA doesn't seem to give much attention to the Switch I doubt we'll see it (which they should as there's hella money on the table); though if they did then I'd love to see a Mass Effect Trilogy hit the Switch as well."
NintendoSwitch,fekpqq7,t1_fekc6ol,1579205059.0,"I think it's more about the publisher.  We've seen M&R at $20, IMO, due mostly because of the praise it's gotten.  StarLink has been down to $10 (actually it's $6 right now on Amazon).  Regardless, this title has historically been part of many ""crazy deal"" promos and I'm sure we'll see it drop - especially to get some legs during this year's ""new console"" holiday."
PS4,fekgu2u,t3_epmi0s,1579199760.0,At this point I may just wait for the PS5 version that will inevitably release at or close to launch <cough>TwilighPrincess<cough>.
NintendoSwitch,fek3cac,t1_feju8x7,1579191731.0,"I'm not sure, I picked up Assassin's Creed Rebel Collection on launch and it's already hit the $20 mark.  I'm sure we'll see it at 20 before year's end."
NintendoSwitch,fejtoaf,t3_epjphy,1579185593.0,The Switch is steadily becoming a portable PS3/XBox 360 - and I'm more than OK with that!  Looking forward to picking this up sub $20 and getting further than I did with my PS4 copy.
patientgamers,fee4eic,t3_eooxfw,1579026163.0,"Great write-up, good to hear that it's not the nightmare fuel that it was portrayed as at launch (I know they've done quite a bit of work to patch it).  Still haven't taken the plunge, but I'm sure someday I'll want to visit it as I really enjoyed ME2/3."
networking,fdqsujj,t3_emskpf,1578674143.0,"Your co-worker is incorrect.  The port needs to be configured as a trunk with the native VLAN being on your management VLAN so that it can boot up and get an IP.  Every SSID / VLAN that will be local switched will have a VLAN tag that exists on the AP itself (you can see this by connecting to the APs CLI).  If that port is Access, then that dot1q tag is ignored once it gets to the switch port.

Edit: Any centrally switched SSID will be tunneled back to the controller on the CAPWAP tunnel from the ap's management interface."
PS5,fdne3u4,t1_fdlzxen,1578583848.0,"While I'm a huge Sony fan, keep in mind that the XBox One, for the most part, does this already - meaning it wouldn't be unique.  I'm not saying BC isn't the big feature, but when one looks back on it, the PS4 is the only Sony console that has not had BC from the start.  I'm hoping that BC is a feature, but I'm really hoping it's not what he's referring to."

todayilearned,fd3wk27,t1_fd2ngbn,1578162271.0,"Gen X'er here with a 19 and 12 year old who had a fairly absent father.  Parenting has essentially forced me to come out of my comfort zone and become more involved both in my child's life and our community.  Driven to be more involved with them, I've sat on school councils, planning committees, sat up studying with them, and been an assistant coach more times than I can count.  I've told my kids that their job is to test boundaries and my job is to draw the boundaries.  Regardless, parenting is one of the most draining and rewarding experiences you can have."
movies,fcuzgyq,t1_fcuz56f,1577991593.0,"Wow, seems someone put ""be angry"" on their 2020 new year's resolution.  I was simply asking the question, not inferring that he is a bad person.  Also, it was noted that he personally contacted the cops to thank them for playing a role in him changing his behavior."
movies,fcur86s,t3_eiz9d6,1577986862.0,Was the arrest mentioned in the article the one that made Live PD's top 20 of 2017?  He was a complete ass to everyone in that video.

patientgamers,fbqy6qc,t3_ee68g5,1577036924.0,I compare it a lot to Assassin's Creed.  The first had some great mechanics that weren't fully fleshed out and it was a slog to get through.  The sequel came out and fixed everything wrong with the original and then some.  ME2 still sits in my list of greatest games of all time
