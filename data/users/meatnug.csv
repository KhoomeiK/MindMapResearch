Trump will stop that, right?"

LA times says from Oct 2017 to May 2018 alone, 700 children have been seperated from the people they are with. 
Perhaps some are being trafficked. It does not say. 
But again, where are those kids? 


How many since then?

The last article is an opinion piece about a slippery slope. Might be true, might not. Where are the kids? 

And Thank you for showing that the trump administration does in fact put kids in cages."
