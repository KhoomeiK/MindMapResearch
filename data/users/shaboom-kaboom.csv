FocusST,few0xys,t1_few0b06,1579403911.0,Low speed pre-ignition. Basically forcing too much pressure into the engine while it isn’t getting exhausted fast enough. Compression ratio spikes and grenades the engine.

interestingasfuck,fdwo0ib,t1_fdwe6c5,1578760702.0,A lot of the damage that you see isn’t from simple erosion. Most of the casing stones were loosened or broken away from a massive earthquake in 1303. After that some stones were removed by locals.
