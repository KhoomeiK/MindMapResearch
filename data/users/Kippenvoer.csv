My dad found it hard to accept, when i was still living at home and he got pushy i just blocked him on everything and lived at my then-girlfriends house for 3 weeks.

Now he has accepted it, he doesn't like it and his father, my grandpa is angry at him for ""not raising me and my brother right"" so i feel kinda bad for him. If he hadn't told granpa i could just lie for him.

But in the end he loves me just a much, he really believes what he is doing will save me. It's not his fault his brain is so corrupted by this great dillusional lie. I'm fairly certain being dead is the same as not being born yet and nothing else."
