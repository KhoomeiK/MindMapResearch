UpliftingNews,ff81jml,t1_ff7zxbu,1579663561.0,a lot of these demonstrations last hours and I think oftentimes the trash is piled up around an already full garbage can.
UpliftingNews,ff7z0g6,t1_ff7c72x,1579661746.0,"snacks, drinks, a lot of people get there early to get a good spot so they bring fast food to eat, maybe people ditch their signs. 

I'd bet if the protest is a march organizers aren't going out in advance and placing trashcans along the route for people. If it's not a march I'd bet people aren't switching out the bags frequently enough as the cans fill up.

All this is exacerbated by the 2 things:

1) Once people start throwing trash on the ground more people are likely to do it because it becomes more acceptable in their minds

2) Organizers often will contract with a company to clean up afterwards as part of the permitting process, so people view it as no big deal since someone is taking care of it."

Like it was made as a sequel to season 1 while the others are made as distinct seasons tackling specific issues (politics, the media, schools). I know they used the dock workers to explore issues of working class people in the city but it seemed like they put it at the docks because that's where McNulty was reassigned to but other than that the docks were largely inconsequential to the overall story of the show as a whole."

todayilearned,ff0tspr,t1_feyz5e3,1579472227.0,"my argument didn't change. You're saying they should've been able to project it and that projections are part of a business. 

A projection is not ""this is going to happen"" a projection is coming up with a bunch of possibilities and their probabilities of coming true over various time spans. You conflating the two. 

I'm sure they had someone say ""maybe brick and mortar stores in general are declining and video rental places in particular"" but they either had a low probability assigned to it or thought it'd take longer. My argument this whole time has been that this was a reasonable view in 2000."
todayilearned,feyyom4,t1_feyr9v4,1579452108.0,"> People were consuming media on the internet. 

Umm, not really. There were news sites but there wasn't really ""media"" on the internet in 2000. Youtube wouldn't come along for another 5 years. The initial build of Napster came out in 1999 and wouldn't have a ""stable build"" until 2002. The iTunes store wouldn't be around until 2003. None of the media companies were interested in putting their assets online so all you had were websites that were selling the physical copies (books, cds, dvds) - I don't think that qualifies as ""consuming media on the internet"" so much as plain old ecommerce.

As far as these ecommerce sites many were starting to go belly up in 2000 while companies like Walmart, Costco, Barnes & Nobles were launching their own services in the late 90's early 2000s. Blockbuster joined these companies with their own service that year so it isn't unreasonable for their management team to think theirs would prevail over Netflix and that Netflix wasn't worth the $50M valuation mentioned at that meeting especially since many of the online only companies at the time weren't profitable."
todayilearned,feyqyto,t1_feyd4e0,1579449491.0,">They definitely would have had the ability to see what was coming.

I disagree personally. Back then there weren't all these subscription services they have now. Besides Netflix the only other ""media subscription"" sorta thing was that Columbia records plan that had a bad reputation for being shady. 

The dotcom bubble began bursting in March of 2000 and the high profile [Pets.com](https://Pets.com) bust was in November of that year, so if this meeting was in the latter half of the year Blockbuster probably viewed it as a dot-com company trying to sell out on the brink of collapse. That would've been an entirely respectable decision."

* A big part of what they're paying for is the professionalism - someone to do it now, someone who has insurance for in case they screw it up and leave the wrong kid unblurred, experience and knowledge to reliably do the job, etc.
* If they're blurring the faces for privacy, part of that process is hiring someone who is properly screened to view the faces in the first place, not a rando off the internet who says they can do it this Thursday after work.
* A B2B service is never going to charge $35/hour, more like $150+ an hour, the guy doing it probably gets paid about $35/hr, then the business has to take it's cut, cover overhead, etc.
* Finally, as with everything in government contracting there's obvious bloat to all the costs."

If you asked me what the Roman Empire was I'd tell you it was an ancient Empire that controlled most of the Mediterranean in the immediate centuries after the year 0. I wouldn't point you to a 10 minute video explaining the complicated  socio-political dynamics causing it to crumble from inside while mass migrations of people from outside the empire pressured it. 

Why? Because it's know you're audience - if you're answering a 1 line question by a stranger on the internet you give them a brief explanation; if they're a neurobiology phd candidate, then go into more detail."

that's absolutely right but choosing a vague, immeasurable goal is not really helping all that much. Like you said they have a lot of expertise and infrastructure built up so they should've just chosen another disease to eliminate. I wouldn't hold any criticism of them if they said ""we're going to cure hiv now"" or ""we'll use our resources to cure Crohn's"" or childhood leukemia or any other goal with a specified end point rather than ""improve outcomes for expecting mothers and newborns"""
