Instagramreality,ffa1tf9,t3_eshy47,1579726179.0,Before she turned off the comment she always deleted comments about the obvious. I’m also sure that she buys likes/followers because all photos have more than 4000 likes and there were no more than 9 comments

SexyButNotPorn,ff40eqd,t1_ff405k7,1579552816.0,"No, I’m not but it’s pretty obvious here. I looked at her Instagram and she looks like that.

ThatLookedExpensive,feylpe2,t3_eqoubq,1579447278.0,In Germany you aren’t allowed to drive a car alone when you are younger that 18. You can make your license while being 17 but then you can only drive when someone is in the car who already had it’s license. You also have to go to a driving school. You are also only allowed to drive with a real driving teacher when you make your license. I think that’s a really good system.
me_irl,feks2fq,t3_epotyz,1579206431.0,I once cut myself while we were on vacations in Spain. My mom just wanted to put a band aid on it. When my dad saw it he immediately said that we need to go to a doctor because it needed to be stitched. It was a bit funny. My dad couldn’t speak Spanish and he wasn’t really good in English so I sat there in a bikini and watched how my dad tried to explain what happened. The bad thing was that they said I couldn’t go into the pool or sea for like a week.

ThatLookedExpensive,fegynpb,t1_fegx7x7,1579105448.0,My driving teacher always said that you have to check if there’s a train even when the gate is up. You don’t necessarily have to stop but you should drive slowly and look to the right and left
