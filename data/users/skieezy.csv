Not if you are just smoking near a gas pump."

>PARTLY PLAUSIBLE

>A cigarette has the potential to light a pool of gasoline but just doesn’t have enough sustained heat. Gas ignites between 500 °F and 540 °F, the cigarette at its hottest was between 450 °F and 500 °F but only when it was actually being smoked. An ignition is very improbable.

You got your numbers wrong, the max cigarette temperature is the minimum flash point. In other words you would have to stick the cigarette in your mouth grab the nozzle and hold it like half an inch from the cigarette and suck hard."

funny,fepi89t,t1_fephelg,1579321165.0,"can you find me a single video? I've tried before and never found one. Chances that outside a cigarette lights gasoline (yes I know, it's fumes, it's still gasoline and it's always the fumes that ignite because it needs oxygen to light) are more like .001% or less.

Edit: Downvotes streaming in, one guy tried posting a video of a lady lighting a gas pump through static electricity. Which can easily be done, [Video of static electricity lighting gas pump](https://youtu.be/VjrkwxMhc4s?t=249)

Edit 2: Two people have shown me these supposed ""videos of cigarettes lighting cars"" both of them are people touching the car seat then touching the pump handle causing a flame to ignite from static electricity. Still waiting."
