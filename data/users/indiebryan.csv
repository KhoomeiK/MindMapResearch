Like OP, I thought it was pretty cringey and not something I self identify with. But what I've noticed is that locals in a lot of the countries I live in seem to know and associate the term ""digital nomad"" with ""foreign, probably young and white, person who works from their laptop"". So when someone asks if that's what I am I don't take offense, I'm just like ""yeah"", because it's an easy identifier that lets people know a few base things about my situation"

digitalnomad,feg7oq8,t1_feg6eck,1579080937.0,"You could also look into rural Japan & Korea for something cheaper than say Tokyo or Seoul.  I stayed a month on Jeju island off the south of the Korean peninsula and it is very peaceful, quiet, kind of boring this time of year tbh but might be exactly what you're looking for to focus on your work.  I got a ton of work done during my time there.

I'm also planning on spending my first month in Japan this year in Okinawa, so again a little off the beaten path from the usual DN locales of Tokyo/Osaka which I stayed in last year.

But both of those options, even in rural areas, will be more expensive than Cambodia.  Similar to Bali, you can get a scooter there (Cambo) pretty easily."
digitalnomad,feg4vo3,t1_feg4h49,1579077028.0,"What part of Malaysia have you been to?  If you're not necessarily looking for a city, Borneo and Penang are two beautiful Malaysian islands each with a growing nomad scene.  (They're also in completely opposite sides of the country so do your research)

Depending on your budget, Japan I think is amazing as well.  I spent 2 months there in 2019 and am returning for 2 months in a few weeks.

I'm in Seoul, Korea at the moment and unfortunately the air is also bad here just like Bangkok, being so close to China.  Masks are also being recommended by the Seoul authorities.  Sadly this kind of thing will only continue to become more prevalent in the region / world in the coming years.

I don't know what the air/weather is like in Cambodia right now but I was there for a month last year and really liked it.  Phnom Penh is pretty bland beyond boozing / gambling, but Siem Reap is like living in an Indiana Jones movie with all the temples around, especially if you rent a motorbike.  It was my travel buddy's favorite place."

New articles every day.  Unfortunately Bangkok deals with this issue often, and it is best to just not travel during these times.  Honestly the one thing that is preventing me from living there year-round."
digitalnomad,feg3n1w,t3_eoyspo,1579075454.0,"Stay on the Silom line. Staying around Chong Nonsi BTS is my personal favorite area but you can stay near any stop. Proximity to the BTS is nice due to convenience and there often being a lot of businesses and things to do along the line. Phayathai and Ratchathewi are another good couple stops to look around.

Beware if you're going right now though that Bangkok is currently in their annual air crisis and mandating masks. 

Personally I love Bangkok. I've stayed there for 5 of my 15 months in Asia so far and am planning on getting a 6 month visa this year.

If you're concerned about being treated like a ""human ATM"" or treated like a tourist as your other comment says, then unfortunately the only way is to not be a prototypical tourist. Learn some Thai. If you decline an offer in Thai there's a 99% chance they won't offer again. A simple ""Mai khrap"" will usually suffice. 

I've taken the time to learn the basics of each country's language I live in and find it makes a huge difference the better I get at it. Good luck"
