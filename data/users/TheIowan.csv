guns,ffcfavk,t1_ffaylpx,1579798221.0,"Not op, but I've done a couple of these. I personally avoid aggressively sanding them, and instead remove the finish as follows: get a couple cans of heavy duty spray on oven cleaner, spray it on and let it soak. Remove it with fine steel wool, and repeat until all the old finish and grime is removed. After that, let the stock dry completely. Once it is dry, you can use the damp towel/iron method to raise out some dents if youd like. Then, use citristrip to give it one final coat and remove. Let the stock dry completely, and apply the finish of your choice. Danish oil looks badass and is durable, and you can mix in some stain for color. I did a mosin with ebony stain and it turned out pretty cool."

todayilearned,fea78sl,t1_fea23at,1578945174.0,"https://thehorse.com/14895/the-equine-eye/ here's a good basic explanation. 
From the article: 
>Something else to ponder. A horseâ€™s eyeball is the largest orb found in any land mammal. This means it also has an oversized retina.
The result? Objects seen by the horse are magnified. To a horse, an object might seem a full 50% larger than it does to a human. Thus, a large dog barking or snapping at its heels might appear as large as a small pony.

Eyes=agility for large animals by allowing them to maneuver around much smaller objects. It's especially important for horse as it means they can move fast without stepping in holes or tripping on branches."

So while a person may be small compared to a horse, from the horses perspective people are large. Couple that with a prey animal mentality and you get an animal that spooks easy."

 upstairs window. I called 911, and yelled into the building that there was a fire. Unfortunately the culture of the people living there was to talk to police, etc. as little as possible. No one would say what happened, and they said everyone was out. Except they weren't.
