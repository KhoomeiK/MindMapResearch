Connected and welcoming campus, with the academic buildings having a focused academic learning feel.

TheAdventureZone,fejwiqo,t3_epj3xn,1579187467.0,"No that’s not what any of us find frustrating about graduation.

What people find frustrating is mostly some of Travis’s new DM symptoms. Overnarrating his story, making too many npc’s, having said npc’s talk over the pc’s way too much. This is stuff I’m able to not let bother me too much but I understand the folks who are bothered by it.

What people are *not* frustrated by is the lack of goals, as you put it. I get those are important things in a story but it. Is. Episode. Five. And fuck your rebuttal to that. DnD as a medium is long winded with not much story 5 hours in. Fuck, most campaigns I’ve been a part of have had the tiniest *fraction* of story that Grad has had 5 hours in. Saying “well LoTR had much more story 5 hours in!” doesn’t make sense. Yeah it had more story at that point because it’s a scripted movie with actors and books to draw plot from. Dnd is a *g a m e* and I think people forget that a lot. You cannot compare the story progression of a game to a set of movies because they are wildly different mediums with different focuses. 

Like I said I understand people’s frustrations with graduation so far but your analysis is not what people are upset about. Sorry."
