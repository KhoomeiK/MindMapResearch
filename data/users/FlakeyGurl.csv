As for me, personally as the mother of a daughter, I am heart broken for you. I am thrilled to have a baby girl and wanted a girl. I'm sad your parents didn't show you how special you are. You don't have to be ""one of the guys."" Yes girls are different and that's okay. You are able to build relationships with men other men can't, and that's beautiful. I'm not just talking about romance, I mean I know for a fact guys feel comfortable being more vulnerable and true to themselves with their females friends, and that's fucking lovely. I hope you come to see being a girl this way. Regardless of what the church says there is so much you can get away with because of your gender, even with your church. Churches who think like that underestimate women. Use that to your advantage, and yea I'm saying be manipulative. if they are too stupid to see their flawed way of thinking is idiotic, take advantage of them the way only a girl can.

If you don't think you will ever be open to being atheist, break up now. There comes a point where atheism becomes incompatible with Christianity in terms of relationships. I didn't start out as strictly atheist when I met my husband, but we have been together almost 13 years now and grown together in that time. If I had stayed in my previous mindset we wouldn't have been able to work out. There's too much to fight and argue about and it's unhealthy in a romantic relationship. It doesn't matter how chill you are, you're gonna argue about how to raise your kids, celebrate holidays, etc. If your family is hyper religious they will give your SO grief. Even if you think your family is super chill. They aren't. They have expectations and as you become an adult you are gonna have to set boundaries between your parents and your romantic relationship/s/partners. Unless you are open to raising kids without religion and 100% down to deal with your partner's needs as an atheist, this relationship is only for fun. Others may try to tell you otherwise, but its very hard to make a serious romantic relationship work between and atheist and a christian."
