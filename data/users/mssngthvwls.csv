fantasybaseball,ffsdrdt,t1_ffsbep3,1580179262.0,"Thanks for the detailed response! I think I'm leaning towards the H2H format with standard scoring structure. I believe the hockey league they've got me in right now is Roto style as we're all adding points to our totals each night and whoever has the most at the end wins. This is fun when you have a good night, but I've found it's fairly easy to run away with the lead - I'm nearly 400 points behind at this point and surely have no chance at closing the gap (though I'm still having fun adding/dropping/trading/setting my lines etc). It seems to me like H2H allows for more of a reset, for lack of a better word, each night, and gives you more of a chance to stay in the hunt long term as you're only facing one opponent at a time. 

One question I have about H2H: while reading up on the ins-and-outs of fantasy baseball, I found there were two ways to score that style - the 6-4 method you mentioned above, and another where it was simply a win or loss based on the number of categories you won (ex: you won six categories and I won four, so you receive one win for the night and I receive one loss). I don't think I want to go this route... Is there a name for each style so I can make sure I pick the 6-4 setup?"
fantasybaseball,ffs184y,t1_ffs0ucl,1580170659.0,"The buy in will be staying - just a way to make it a little more interesting and keep people participating for lack of a better word. I had/have very little knowledge of hockey, yet bought in with them for $20 this season (first time) and am having a blast in 6th out of 8 places. If I didn't have $20 in the pot, I would have probably given up a while ago because I likely won't win. This way, I'm still encouraged to try, and I get to learn along the way."
fantasybaseball,ffs0mzd,t3_et8zyn,1580170257.0,"Hi all, first-timer here. I'm going to set up a casual league this season for 8-10 (... maybe 12 if we get more interest than expected) friends and I'm looking for some advice in terms of format and point structures, if applicable. We plan on all buying in for $20; runner up will get their money back, and first place will take home the rest of the pot. There will be a range of competency in the league with some participants knowing very little about baseball, some with a bit of knowledge, and a couple that follow the sport a little more closely. 

Are there any templates/guidelines you could recommend that would help keep the league as fair and fun as possible? 

Thanks :)

Interestingly enough, you're transferring to a government position and I've also been trying to steer myself in that direction as of late. As you say, the work-life balance is often far better in the public sector than its private counterpart, and there is usually ample opportunity for vertical (or at worst, lateral) movement within those areas. It seems as though with the experience I have, a provincial or federal position might be my best move... though easier said than done. 

I digress. Wishing you a Happy New Year and as much success as you can handle for 2020!"
