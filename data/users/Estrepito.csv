It's similar to how foreign media also ocassionaly covers US politics at key moments.

AskReddit,fcrnhac,t3_eigp35,1577904118.0,"This is one of those questions you don't actually answer. It always leads to a dead end or awkward situation and the person doesn't care anyway (which by the way is why it's a bad question, but people aren't good at dealing with quiet people). Instead, use the attention to get something YOU want.

For example, if you had an opinion about the current or latest subject but couldn't interject, give it now. If you want to talk about something, ask them what they feel about it: ""I was just thinking about xyz, what do you guys think about that?"". In both cases you ignore the question but you acknowledge the attention and participate. It's also a decent idea to give your ""reply"" to the group, not the person who asked you, it's more natural that way.

Alternatively, if you weren't really listening but wouldn't mind being included, say ""oh right, I was daydreaming. What were we talking about?"".

All of these get you included without having to put in a lot of effort, but it IS a chance to get more involved if you wanted to be."

>	Your general physical examination was normal including a **blood pressure of 102/56** mmHg, and pulse of **62 beats/min.** Recent comprehensive laboratory test results indicated your complete blood count, vitamin D level, and thyroid function panel were **normal**. Your fasting **glucose was 84 mg/dL**. Your **total cholesterol was 117mg/dL, HDL cholesterol was 32mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol was 58 mg/dL. ** Your electrocardiogram demonstrated **normal sinus rhythm.**


>	Over the yearsg you have been treated for medical conditions including **gout, hypereholesterolemia, diverticulitis, hypothyroidism, laryngitis secondary to esophageal reflux, lumbar strain, and complete removal of superficial skin lesions**. Your colorectal cancer screening is up to date. Your past surgical history consists of **repair of left and right-side inguinal hernias by laparoscopic technique and a right true vocal cord cyst excision**. In November 2019, a follow-up ENT evaluation of your vocal cords for hoarseness was stable. You have no history of tobacco use, exercise regularly, and seldom drink alcohol. Your current daily medications include **atorvastatin, aspirin, clopidogrel, levothyroxine, and lisinopril.**


>	...Several of the medications you initially required (blood-thinner, beta blocker) were stopped based on your progress. Your heart muscle strength has improved. You have never had symptoms of congestive heart failure. The **heart chamber sizes, wall thickness, estimated pressures, and heart valves are normal**. Several 24-hour recordings of your heart electrical activity indicated no significant heat rhythm abnormality.
In December 2019, you underwent a successful graded exercise treadmill examination monitoring your heart function, muscular exertion, and oxygen consumption that indicated a **maximal level of exertion to 92% of your predicted heart rate** without any evidence of reduced blood flow to your heart or symptoms limiting your exercise performance. Your overall test performance was rated above average compared to a reference population of the same age. The cardiac exercise physiologist who evaluated your results determined that you are fit to resume vigorous activity without limitation."
