howtonotgiveafuck,femc0cr,t1_fekwtc9,1579247917.0,"Maybe you do give a fuck if you go as far as suppressing deep feelings so you look like someone who does not give a fuck.

If a close relative of yours dies (one example of many), wouldn't you give a fuck? The real fuck you should not give is the way society sees you when naturally exteriorizing those feelings as a man. You wanna cry? Cry. You wanna rant? Rant. This is legitimate in this situation, and more importantly: it is healthy.

This is a very specific example. Applies to a lot of traumas in life."

I don't want to politicize this discussion but I saw that Bernie Sanders is gaining traction. What he proposes makes sense: invest in your people instead of against the others by demilitarizing and start investing in education and health.

Tout le reste c'est des histoires inventées très probablement ou au moins très exagérées et sorties de leur contexte. Aucune preuve.

BitcoinCA,fdf3720,t1_fdf0ikw,1578352266.0,"I stand corrected for Newton if there is no Shenanigans.

I think Coinsquare raised the e-transfer deposit fees from last year. I'd still go with Coinsquare over Shakepay though since you can trade freely after the initial deposit.

Newton vs Coinsquare is a question of what is your plan. People tend to diversify their wallet after buying BTC so going with CS would be best in that scenario. If you just buy and transfer the asset to your private wallet then Newton seem like the best deal right now.

Can you trade BTC for other Cryptos in Newton? If you can what is the spread?"
