I have a last one: Do you know why flaring was so common in the Permian Basin area like 5-9 years back?

I used to travel out direction headed towards NM, and sometimes there would be dozens upon dozens of massive flares going off, like 20+ feet high; some large enough you could feel the heat off them in the car while driving by with the windows up.

I've honestly assumed it's been like that the whole time with as low as natural gas prices have stayed, it's fantastic to know the situation has changed and it's not just being wasted anymore."

""The Public Service Commission ruled the accident to be the fault of \[motorman\] Walsh for failing to stop at the posted sign, but noted that such signs were hard to notice and that many drawbridges lacked them entirely. Walsh went to trial for manslaughter in October 1917, with witnesses differing on many aspects of the accident. The bridge tenders claimed the required red lantern had been hung on the gate to warn streetcars of the open bridge, but Walsh claimed he saw no such lantern. Some questioned how the glass lantern had survived the impact of the trolley with the gates, which broke a 4-inch (100 mm) iron post in two; they alleged that the bridge tenders may have actually hung it after the accident. Walsh was declared not guilty, but he never ran a streetcar again and died around 1932 at age 41."""

You posted a fine explanation on larger, long term societal goals we should be going after. Most of those are well established ways to lower crime in the future, we mostly need to get funding for it. There are a few point I don't entirely agree with, and some I'm surprised we share; but seeing as you were generous enough to provide the information, the least I could do is leave it alone.

The ramble didn't, however answer the actual question I've asked about specifics [on an individual level for a person who won't stay on their meds](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/eqhx5n/til_a_florida_man_accidentally_locked_his_1_yr/ff2bkza/) and then commits petty crimes until the situation gets bad enough for intervention. You seemed to be adamant when we were talking before that there is an option better than confinement, and I'm still genuinely curious as to what that could be. So, I'll try again:

Would you care to expand on what ""sufficient mental health services"" would entail for the fella who repeatedly refuses to stay on his meds and then peers into homes, exposes himself in public, and is constantly steals random things off porches? Because I have trouble imagining anything else besides confinement."
todayilearned,ff7khki,t1_ff7g8gs,1579651693.0,"[Again,](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/eqhx5n/til_a_florida_man_accidentally_locked_his_1_yr/ff6zczf/) the catalyst for my options changing was indeed anecdotal evidence and personal feelings, I've mentioned that repeatedly. What isn't anecdotal evidence or personal feelings are the statistics, trends, and comparisons which now back those new, formerly unfounded opinions with hard facts. That's where we are now. 

[However, as I've also stated before,](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/eqhx5n/til_a_florida_man_accidentally_locked_his_1_yr/ff6qjxg/) I don't believe that comparing jurisdiction to jurisdiction should be done via Uniform Crime Reporting statistics for the reasons the [FBI lists here](https://ucr.fbi.gov/ucr-statistics-their-proper-use), which is why I was reluctant to supply, and also criticized cross-state comparisons that agreed with my opinions as well. The methodology is inherently flawed. 

[In addition, as I've mentioned earlier,](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/eqhx5n/til_a_florida_man_accidentally_locked_his_1_yr/ff4kcts/) here in Washington, almost everyone I've spoken to has been a victim at some point, and like I said originally, I witness petty crime here in Tacoma on an almost daily basis. It's certainly possible that all of the people I talked to here about crime, and the personal crimes I've witnessed over the years here are very unlucky coincidence, but I find that very unlikely. I have traveled significantly within Washington as well. My views are based on far more than a single victimization to one person in one city. That would be ridiculous. Property crime is well known to be serious issue in the entire area, and statistics affirm that."
todayilearned,ff7h6ro,t1_ff7eo8j,1579649463.0,"UCR isn't useless, it has plenty of validly when used correctly. Pretty much the only way it isn't supposed to be used is comparing one jurisdictions to another, which the studies you linked relied on heavily for much of their conclusions. 

Statistical data is unarguably more objective, there is no doubt of that. My claim is that because crime is so nuanced; subjective, anecdotal data should not be entirely discounted. Almost all law enforcement involves subjective observations at some point. Some investigations entirely so.

Again, I'm not defending three strike policies, but California is mostly revamping their 2nd strike system because the US supreme court ruled that chronic prison overcrowding in the state was unconstitutional. Crime in California has remained flat during that time, but California's demographics have also shifted greatly during the same period. I don't have many insights on what California should do, or how the policies have actually influenced crime, as I don't know what the local crime climate there is like."
todayilearned,ff7ez1g,t1_ff7ameh,1579648004.0,"It's not, but you keep bringing up the differences in overall violent crime stats between states, so I responded to that. 

It's not obvious, as has been shown in our discussion over the past few days. The laws might be the same on the books, but I can assure you, how harshly the law is applied varies greatly. Enforcement levels will vary significantly from street to street within the same neighborhood even with almost uniform demographics throughout. In addition, successful polices that work in one neighborhood might not work at all in another, or completely backfire. 

It's part of what makes crime so complex, and why it's folly to attempt to create or dismiss solutions remotely via statistics, trends, or comparisons. You need to be there, you need to see what's actually happening in reality, then at that point start forming answers to problems and then see what those answers do. Like I said at the very beginning, it took seeing the other side for myself to accept the realities of the situation; and then be left with no alternative but to abandon my former deeply seated viewpoints."
todayilearned,ff7c8fx,t1_ff79krl,1579646164.0,"Again, nothing about confinement for these low level cases is meant to be  permanent. Removed from society does not mean permanently removed from society. Get them in the system, get them structured help. This might require more institutionalized housing, like a jail but focused more on education. Think of it more of a closed college campus a convict is legally obligated to stay at. Tacoma already has the space for this at the local jail, so no new buildings would need to be constructed. Being confined to ""not jail"" while in the actual jail building I could see being a tough sell, however. 

Yes, I am considering a run for city counsel here, and have been encouraged to do so by several people. Increasing law and order would be a central part of my campaign, and locally thus far, the message has resonated with many people I've spoken to. I was also considering a run in Texas, but my viewpoints were too left of center at the time I lived there. 

I don't think three strikes is necessarily the answer either. More enforcement, when people initially break the law, is however. Three strikes could be part of this, but I do believe there are better ways than it. It's not really more, or stronger laws that are needed here (auto theft was a notable exception), but consistent enforcement of the laws which already exist on the books. 

Being unable to explain even a single proposal about the current conversation in broad, general strokes when asked repeatedly for the idea to be expanded on is certainly suggests that someone doesn't know what they are talking about. Even more so when they attempt to deflect the shortcoming with some folksy adage."

Three strikes policies indeed might not be effective at lowering petty crime rates, either.  It's part of why I'm advocating for overall more enforcement of lower level crimes before people start even racking up those strikes.

The ironic part is that I mentioned a while back that the longer I go without being a victim of crime, the more sympathetic I become.

And no, the studies you linked showed that three strikes policy was linked to a slight decrease in the violent crime rate as a trade off for a slightly higher murder rate; or that the violent crime rate was indeed decreasing after three strikes, but that would of happened anyway.

Below are statistics on property crime rates between the two states. Washington clearly has a higher property crime rate across the board in all three categories of burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft. Especially in major urban areas around the Puget Sound. Part of that is due to lack of enforcement for lower level crimes here in Washington.

Conversely, Oregon has gone the [opposite direction](http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/orcrime.htm) after their motor vehicle theft laws were [weakened in 2014.](https://www.wweek.com/news/state/2019/06/19/oregon-lawmakers-close-loophole-that-allows-easy-car-theft-in-portland/) We'll have more data later this year since that loophole was closed to see if trends in OR reverse.

Most of the time, people just yell at him to go away, and he does. 

We're also still talking about misdemeanors. Minor, petty crime that currently has little enforcement; not enhancing penalties on violent crime. The original post I replied to was talking about stealing $3 of lunch meat. Violent crime is already well enforced here in Washington, I've mentioned that several times. A discussion of increasing almost no enforcement to some enforcement is not comparable to the discussion of going for some enforcement to extreme enforcement. I'm not arguing in favor of locking anyone away forever, nor enhancing three strike penalties for violent crime. 

Again, life is significantly more complicated than rows of data, or the letter of the law. The plea bargain rate for case clearance in the US is a good example of this. If the law were actually enforced perfectly the way it's written, we wouldn't be having this conversation at all. Washington, and pretty much everywhere else would be a utopia.

You can break minor laws all you want, so long as you have enough time between infractions. 2 year or so of keeping your nose clean is all that is needed in most cases. Were you not aware people were able to do this? All states are like this in the US. It's usually called probation. 

Three strikes and rehab being intertwined is the point I'm trying to make. What I've been advocating for is that the rehab be made mandatory via the three strikes (or similar) system. We still need to lock people up when they fuck up too many times to keep the rest of us safer, but get them help and services while they are locked up. I have no idea why you're latching to the hyperbole of three strikes means automatic life in prison, because it doesn't by any stretch of the imagination.

> Except that those policies don't work according to the authority figures in charge of those programs. 

Can I get a source on that? If anything, the authority figures staunchly claim success in the face of obvious defeat pretty routinely. I wouldn't put much trust an authority figure in charge of any program to declare success or failure of said program they manage. 

They aren't the same sets of statistics. Statistics can be subject to highly different variables in reporting which makes them more or less valid, especially in comparisons between them. Tracking individuals throughout their lifetime tends to yield pretty accurate results about that individual's life, as it's one person, one life at time. This in no way means that comparing raw crime data from jurisdiction to jurisdiction across the country is comparable in any way, just because they are both sets of statistics. Like I said before, WA is mutual combat state, Texas isn't; that alone completely invalidates all data comparisons between the two in regards to assaults, and thusly violent crime rates. This is much different reporting than watching Billy Bob and seeing how frequently he go to jail over his lifespan."

>""in Texas, violent crimes are not all that rare.  They're certainly more  common than petty crimes, which might explain why you know fewer people  there who have been victims of petty crime. ""

This is just nonsense. Do you think Texas is like some western movie? Minor property crimes far outnumber violent crimes in Texas, just like every other state. 

Also, again, in regards to Texas vs Washington violent crime rate: Washington State is excellent about quickly prosecuting people who  commit crimes against persons. I wouldn't be shocked in the violent crime rate was actually lower here because the state does exactly what I'm advocating with violent criminals: Locks them away and gets them mandated help. 

It's impossible to provide ""real evidence"" that additional incarceration reduces the crime rate, that's just not how the statistics work. Perhaps one day you'll move away from the area you currently live where you've been victim to crime on numerous occasions to a place that has implemented the policies I'm advocating about and see for yourself how much better that works. Statistics do not effectively communicate the nuances of the situation. Like I've said numerous times, it took me going the opposite way to finally accept reality for what it is. Life is much more complicated than rows of data."
todayilearned,ff4ki9f,t1_ff0ugt0,1579565816.0," **The Philadelphia studies and others**

Since the 1960s, researchers have probed how often youths come into  police contact, consistently finding that a subset of people account for  around half of the crimes reported to police.

In the seminal [""Crime in a Birth Cohort""](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986609?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)  and a followup study, a team led by University of Pennsylvania  criminologist Marvin Wolfgang tracked nearly 10,000 boys born in 1945  and living in Philadelphia from age 10 through 17; they ultimately  gauged how often each boy came in contact with police for an offense.  One upshot: 627 boys, 6 percent of the group, each accounted for five or  more offenses, according to police reports. Those boys, Wolfgang wrote,  were collectively identified as responsible for 52 percent of all the  offenses recorded in the study and, he said, about two-thirds of all  violent crimes believed to have been committed by the juveniles. In  Patrick-speak, Wolfgang found that 6 percent of juvenile boys accounted  for about half of alleged juvenile crimes.

[The follow-up study](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/86680NCJRS.pdf),  presented in progress in 1982, tracked more than 28,000 boys and girls  born in 1958 who lived in Philadelphia from age 10 through 17. Among  males, the study found, 61 percent of reported  offenses  were committed  by 1,030 ""chronic recidivists,"" comprising 7 percent of males in the  study. That is, 7 percent of the boys accounted for 61 percent of the  juvenile offenses.

David Farrington, a University of Cambridge professor of psychological criminology [reported in 2006 ](http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/people/academic_research/david_farrington/hofind281.pdf)on  criminal offenses by 411 South London boys occasionally interviewed by  the team starting when the subjects were 8 years old in 1961. The  researchers, who also checked criminal records, found that a ""small  proportion of the study males (7%) were defined as ‘chronic offenders’  because they accounted for about half of all officially recorded  offenses"" in the study. The most common offenses, they wrote, included  thefts, burglaries and car thefts followed by violence, vandalism, fraud  and drug abuse.

In 2014, Swedish researchers drawing on records accounting for the  experiences of 2.5 million people born in that country from 1958 to 1980  [reported that](https://phys.org/print305556181.html) from  1973 to 2004, some 1 percent of the population accounted for 63 percent  of all violent crime convictions. Researcher  Örjan Falk added:  ""Psychotic disorders are twice as common among repeat offenders as in  the general population, but despite this fact they constitute a very  small proportion of the repeat offenders.""

todayilearned,ff4kcts,t1_ff3yi6r,1579565711.0,"I assumed if someone was willing to actually wade though the text of multiple studies themselves, it wouldn't be too much work to read a short article and pick out hyperlinks from the accompanying descriptions.

Again, my mistake; in the past this hasn't been an issue with anyone listing a article with multiple sources within it. The relevant section will be posted to the reply with the linked article.   

Unfortunately, as the legal system currently stands in the US right now, if an adult refuses help, there is no way to force them into treatment, and so we do need to wait for them to commit a crime before getting services. That's just the way it works. No nation has been successful at preventing all crimes proactively; even if the system were somehow perfect, some people would still evade all diversion. People come from perfectly fine, supportive backgrounds and still become criminals. There is a lot more to crime than just the kid from a broken home stereotype. 

Yes, we need to try to help as many people while we can, but some just get to a point where they are beyond help while still out in general society. This doesn't mean people need to be incarcerated forever after strike three, but they need more structure than the revolving door justice system gives now. Part of that is locking them up after they commit crimes repeatably, then getting them support while on the inside. Right now the solution in WA is send petty criminals to jail for a trivial amount of time, or release them with unsupported rehabilitation and hope for the best. It doesn't work. 

Yes, the program I was in was in Texas, and they made it abundantly clear that if I fucked up again, even something very minor, there was jail waiting for me, plus stricter supervision conditions than what I was already on after that. I can almost guarantee if I had been given leeway like what is given here in Washington, I'd be a homeless career criminal by now. Texas has numerous job training and education programs for the incarcerated. The goal isn't just to have people rotting in a cell doing nothing all day.

However, hard truth of the matter is that some people just aren't going to get well enough to be out permanently, even with with intensive support. Let's go back to the guy in my neighborhood. What's a practical way to ensure him taking his meds, if he's repeatedly refused to do so, and not terrorizing people while not confined? Others aren't nearly as benign as he is. KOMO news recently produced a [special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpAi70WWBlw) partially on this issue with mental health in the Seattle area specifically. The issues I'm describing aren't confined to Tacoma; if anything Tacoma has less minor nuisance crime than Seattle or Portland. 

Safe from crime is a relative term, not zero total crime. I may of gotten lucky in Texas, but so did all my friends, family, virtually all of my co-workers, and I witnessed by random chance very little crime occur to other people. It's the opposite is here, almost everyone I've spoken to has been victim at some point, and like I said originally, I witness petty crime here in Tacoma on a daily basis. I also lived and worked in a significantly more impoverished, and statistically more crime filled area in Texas than what I do here. It's certainly possible that all these people over just shy of two decades in Texas were lucky; and all the people I talked to here about crime, and the personal crimes I've witnessed over the years here are very unlucky, but I find that very unlikely. I have traveled significantly within both states as well. This is based on far more than a single victimization to one person in one city. That would be ridiculous. 

We're also talking about common petty crime, not rare violent crimes; which both have very different motives, victims, methods of prevention, and punishment. Washington State is excellent about quickly prosecuting people who commit crimes against persons. I wouldn't be shocked in the violent crime rate was actually lower here because the state does exactly what I've advocating with violent criminals: Locks them away and gets them mandated help.

It addition it should be mentioned that statistical crime reporting isn't comparable with other jurisdictions. The FBI, which complies that data explicitly states [not to use it in that way for a number of reasons.](https://ucr.fbi.gov/ucr-statistics-their-proper-use) Local crime statistics really can only be viewed against their own data, and state statistic are complied form local sources. This also brings critical flaws into “did this work or not” studies when comparing different areas which have implemented different policies. For example, Washington is a mutual combat state, if two people want to fight on the street here, they can and cops will just stand by and watch them. In Texas, everyone gets an assault charge if the cops roll up on a fistfight."

Politifact is usually quite accurate in their sources, and I erroneously assumed you'd ignore the obvious rhetoric at the top and focus on the numerous studies below because of the pants on fire rating. Mea culpa; I can list alternative links if you'd like?

Otherwise, there seem to be several facts that we both acknowledge about crime, but we appear to drawing different conclusions:

\- I agree, many people get drawn into the criminal justice system. That 41% sounds about right.

\- I too agree, that a number of documented youth repeat offenders are relatively easy to target with programs designed to help them.

\- I also agree that many of the documented repeat offenders have mental health issues.

Now for the disagreements:

There isn't any practical way to proactively prevent a number of crime beforehand, only to engage after the fact. This isn't much of a problem with the vast majority; as stated before, youth repeat offenders are relatively easy to target with programs designed to help them. No one should be locked away for years for their first misdemeanor. That first crime, and first getting into the system is an ideal way to prevent future crimes. I've personally been though this part of the justice system myself, and it worked.

The issue comes up when repeat offenders aren't deterred by rehabilitation or intervention programs. Part of the trouble with this is that in the United States, the only way to get someone with severe mental health issues into the proper programs as an adult unless they agree voluntarily is through the criminal justice system. Unless they are “punished” with forced rehabilitation, most won't go.

Unfortunately the reality of the situation is yes; there are just some broken people for whom there is no hope for on the outside, and they should spend virtually all of their lives removed from society in some fashion. This doesn't necessarily mean jail or prison, but it is going to be some sort of involuntary confinement somewhere away from the rest of us. This is indeed a very small percentage of the population, but right now they are able to run amok.

For example, in my neighborhood here in Tacoma, there is a fella who fits this description perfectly. The guy is about 35, has severe mental health problems, and cycles in an out of jail or Washington State frequently. The pattern is always the same: Guy gets caught doing some minor crime, they look at  his rap sheet, go “Ah! You are clearly in need of services” ship him off to get mental health treatment, he does better, gets released, stops taking his meds because no one makes him, and then we're back to crimes again. It's like every 6 months to 2 years this happens. Right now he's back in the neighborhood and has already been filmed a few times looking in people's windows at 2-3AM. Guy has been a problem for over a decade now. The whole neighborhood knows him by name.

I too hope that I'm not a victim of further crime, partially because the longer I go without being a victim, the more tolerant and sympathetic I become. To be blunt however; as long as there are people enabling criminals, it seems unlikely that I will be safe from crime anytime soon. What's I think is the most surprising, is that as recently as 4 years ago, my beliefs used to align with yours almost entirely. It really took seeing the contrast between the zero tolerance policies of Texas, and the 'compassion to a fault' polices of the West Coast to change my mind. I was able to leave my car unlocked for 15 years in Texas and nothing was stolen, not once. A year here in Washington, and someone had already busted a window of my wife's car. Washington has 10x the social support Texas ever had, yet astronomical more crime. It's very difficult to draw any other conclusion after witnessing this firsthand."

However, the program being spread out over 24 months, and they only manged to get 363 people into it is a bit eyebrow raising as well. Especially considering the program is only targeting those with multiple arrests in the Denver area. If a homeless person is able to keep out of trouble for the most part, the SIB program will never attempt to get them housing. I was incorrect; and self selection basis among the homeless population from weather is apparently not the issue, but inherent selection basis of the SIB program itself is. It's not the threat of winter making them pick housing, but the threat of going back to jail, because they've already been several times.

The people the SIB program targets need help, and the SIB program seems to be doing a good job of it; but lets not pretend that the people the SIBs are helping is a representative sample of the homeless population as a whole. They are seeking out the most desperate whom have already become entangled with the legal system.

r/vagabond is indeed mostly travelers, but the critical part is they are homeless travelers. I'm not sure why you don't not want to call it homelessness, but that's what it is; just a different kind. The vast majority of them don't want help, but it doesn't negate they are in fact, homeless, frequently by choice. Why? For the same reasons people did it years ago: It's fun, you get to travel, and see the world for very cheap.

That being said, almost all the the r/\*\*\*\*dwellers subs are genuinely homeless, usually considered unsheltered homeless. Plenty of people on there are gaming the system and doing an enviable job of it. They making good money while being homeless in a van down by the river. There isn't anything wrong with this, it just needs to be recognized that some homeless people are indeed homeless by choice. They don't need help, they don't want help, but they are still homeless.

Like I said last post, we're talking about two very, very different groups of homeless people. Acknowledging that some of the homeless population doesn't want or need help does not in any way negate that an entirely different part of the homeless population has a desperate need for services."

Part of the issue, if you could call it that, is that before being convicted of a crime Americans retain pretty much all rights; it's almost impossible to actually get people into real rehab unless they want to go, or are forced to by law. 

While I agree the recidivism rate is higher in places that don't rehabilitate,  harsher sentences do indeed reduce crime. The societal impacts of the harsh sentences are very much debatable, but crime will be reduced simply because more people are confined in a place where they can't commit more crimes. 

In regards to auto theft at least, harsher laws were needed. Someone could be caught stealing a half dozen cars, and as long as you told the cops you didn't know it was stolen, they'd let someone go. This all happened before I moved to the area, but researching it more, it seem like a court ruling that triggered this loophole, they laws were never intend that way, and just needed to be updated; which occurred at full government speed.

Three strikes comes into play once someone has re-offended enough times through petty crime while still under supervision.

From what I've observed and experienced, it seems to break down somewhat along these lines:

The Houseless: They simply don't have a house. They have legitimate income, maybe a vehicle, perhaps even a credit card, or some savings; all they are lacking is a physical building. I've personally been in this group before, as have friends of mine. Ending homelessness for them is by far the easiest, and it frequently revolves itself with services already available. Normally very benign, there is a pretty good chance you interact with houseless people on a daily basis and don't even notice.

The Ill: With subgroups of mental illness, physical illness, and drug induced illness: This group has problems that probably won't resolve themselves on their own, and require some sort of intervention. One of the costlier groups, not to mince words; but it should be made clear, they are usually not to fault for their sickness (yes, even drug abuse). I personally think this is one of society’s burdens which can only be resolved by collective help. Historically, this group has existed since we've ever first written about homelessness. They need help, but might not be willing to receive it, which sometimes ends tragically.

Bums: Physically and mentally healthy, they just don't want to work enough to afford housing. Nothing necessarily wrong with that; I'm sure most of us can agree, work sucks. Not criminals, not dangerous, another benign group. Hobos, vagabonds, gypsies, drifters, swagman, ect; they have existed in one form or another for centuries. Steinbeckian, if pressed for one word. 

Criminal Transits: Saved the best for last. Everyone hates these guys, including all the other homeless groups listed earlier. They prey on both the homeless, and housed alike. They are criminals, whom just happen to not have a permanent residence. These people belong in jail, or prison. They may use other homeless populations as a way to conceal their degeneracy from enforcement. They can be dangerous, there isn't any other way to put it. What's worse, is this group fuels most of the animosity towards the other three.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I've been mulling this over for a bit now, and haven’t been able to advance the idea further without the input of others."
todayilearned,fcyjq3x,t1_fcyaffp,1578081225.0,"Unfortunately, yes. Never lived in a metro area over a million that didn't have these problems clearly visible. 

However, it should be mentioned that millions of Americans don't live in cities as large, and even if they do, it's probably in the suburbs and they either never use mass transit at all, or it's a premium-fare commuter route; they probably don't see ""downtown"" issues on a daily basis. 

Public spaces in major urban areas in the States can get really rough, really fast without near constant maintenance and enforcement."

Tacoma,fcl6snf,t1_fckoagx,1577741042.0,"That's the issue, the jobs are in and around Seattle, not Tacoma. 

Part of the reason positions remain unfilled is to get to those jobs everyday, workers either need to commute three hours round trip from Tacoma, or pay to live in Seattle. Some might find that acceptable for the $80k mid-level careers; but it's much more difficult to justify for lower level, sub $20/hour tech job that someone could jump into with just a high school degree. It's not necessarily a lack of openings that is the problem, it's where those openings are located in proximity to Tacoma. It creates an artificially high barrier of entry for young tech-worker hopefuls. Commute, or do a MCOL to HCOL move into the city.  

The labor force for lower skilled tech jobs is already here in Tacoma, there isn't much training needed to work something like level 1 support. Most tech hubs have thousands of these jobs in lower rent suburbs, or the town down the road. The problem is that if one of the big players wanted to open something like that in Tacoma, there just isn't enough large, low rent space for it here. So the jobs are up north, or in entirely other states where there's both office space & labor. It's part of why we're spending billions of dollars on a train to get us up there a little bit easier. I just think a 2nd prong of the plan should also be attempting to bring office space, and the employers that will likely follow it to Tacoma.

Employee retention is another topic entirely, but I don't see much reason why similar talking points that apply to any other job that involves employer training, and escalating salaries throughout the career path which wouldn't also apply to tech."

Tacoma,fcjlvyt,t1_fcjf3bs,1577693068.0,"That's the thing, there isn't nearly as much money to be made, in comparison to Seattle, on the first few large office projects luring companies here. It's why new office space hasn't been, and won't be built in Tacoma anytime soon. It's also why I'm pretty sure Tacoma is headed toward becoming a bedroom community for Seattle: It's the most politically feasible option. Too many voters would view the amount of public funding required to get new offices built here as too much corporate welfare, and it'll never actually get passed. They'd be right, because that's exactly what that sort of funding would be, but it's also what's needed to help level a very uneven playing field."
Tacoma,fcj6ik8,t1_fciqc9d,1577678487.0,"Building more office space is step one. There are however significant hurtles, mostly that construction costs here in Tacoma are about on par with Seattle. Land is cheaper here, as is some labor, but not enough to make up lower rent office space commands in Tacoma vs Seattle. As a result, new offices are built in Seattle, not here. We do have a leg up on Seattle in this regard as there are still plenty of older buildings downtown which can be rehabbed into offices in a more cost effective manner compared to building new. 

However for new construction, I'm concerned that leveling the playing field enough to getting office space built here is going to require significant public investment. There is just too much of an economic disparity in potential office rents and too many similarities in constriction costs compared to Seattle to overcome. There isn't a clear answer for how this should be addressed. Anything ranging from Tacoma being a bedroom community for Seattle, to aggressively public funding office construction in order to poach jobs could be considered valid routes forward.

\[Controversial opinions ahead\] 

>!Personally, I think we're on the trajectory to becoming a bedroom community. Which isn't disastrous, but Tacoma has so much more potential, and has accomplished so much in such a short period of time to just become ""a place where your house is."" If we need to publicly fund a million square feet of office space in order to attract jobs here, so be it. Having our citizen's major option for work being to sit in traffic, or on transit 2 hours a day should be considered a pubic emergency. The amount of man-hours and productivity Tacoma loses to commuting is ridiculous. I really think like other social services, providing space for employment in Tacoma should be considered a public service for the good of the citizens. !<"
Tacoma,fcigr4z,t3_ehaehq,1577662287.0,"I agree with what others have said in that Tacoma isn't likely to attract a headquarters, or higher level development center of any of the majors tech players anytime soon.

However, there are thousands of lower and mid tier tech jobs that Tacoma is also missing out on which don't need to have immediate access to the top level talent pool in Seattle. It's pretty common for larger tech companies to have several offices with varying compensation levels scattered in an urban area.

Much in the same way it's critical to maintain costly office space downtown to attract talent; it doesn't make economic sense for a relatively low paid hourly worker to commute all the way downtown for a support role in an office where you could measure the rent in cents-per-hour when the same support role could be done just as well out here in a commuter city.

For a blend of reasons, Tacoma is also missing out on these mid & lower skill tech job openings that could very well be filled by the people already living here. It's part of why the tech boom in Seattle is causing displacement in Tacoma instead of bringing locals along for the ride with it. We're caught in a cycle where the stepping stone jobs into tech just aren't in Tacoma, a crippling commute up north to where those jobs are impacts effective earnings & morale. So if you want a job in Tacoma, it's probably not in tech, which doesn't help the labor pool here become more tech ready, which leads to the stepping stone jobs into tech not being located in Tacoma. Rinse and repeat."
RealEstate,fci5jj9,t3_eh770x,1577658019.0,"Just to add on to what others have been saying about local laws: 

Even if there aren't laws in place now, effectively tossing a whole bunch of people out on the street, partially from improvements the state paid for, just because the landlord wanted more rent money might cause enough of a push back that new laws might be passed. 

Something similar happened in Tacoma when a new owner wanted to rehab their building: ""The Tiki Apartments were purchased by the Seattle-based CWD  Investments LLC earlier this month. On April 5, residents in all 58  units received a notice from Allied Residential, the third-party company  that now manages the property. The notices indicated that residents in  half of the units have until April 30 to vacate. Residents in the other  half have until the end of May.

The notice said that the property will be “going through a major renovation in the next few months” and offered “a  one-time relocation benefit of $900 … exchanged for your apartment keys on the prearranged move out date.” ""

Open and shut, cash for keys, all done, right?

No. People got pissed, they got organized, then they got the city to pass emergency ordinances preventing the non renewals. The city then also passed permanent ordinances making Tacoma have some of the strongest tenant protections in the state. Relocation assistance payments, staggered deposits & last month's rent, very long notice requirements, all landlords in Tacoma need to deal with this now because new owners tried to do something similar to what OP is asking about. 

I'd tread very carefully here, housing can be a sensitive issue."

Tacoma,fcabj1x,t1_fca2819,1577566187.0,"Deposit should be returned to you, so it's already saved. Last months rent would be saved in lieu of paying last month rent on current apartment. You'd need to save for the next months rent anyway, it just also is the first month at the new place. The only additional savings would be the moving expenses. Sell used, buy used, this isn't 100% efficient, but you won't spend that much money on furniture, maybe a few hundred extra for an entire apartment. Other than a bed that is; honestly, I'd wait to move long distances until it's time to change mattresses, they are very difficult to move far and just aren't worth it. Thermarest on the floor until a mattress goes on sale in your new city isn't so bad.

And yes, out of the car in hotels/motels/airbnb. I personally did a motel for the few days to get my bearings, extended stay hotel for a little over couple weeks after that, then apartment after my wife and I got our first local paychecks."
Tacoma,fca1foz,t1_fc9z2oc,1577561511.0,"Because it is easy. 

It doesn't cost that much to move, especially if you are just moving a carload one way.

First months/last months/deposit move in costs for a rental will be the same or less as what it is where you currently live. Pretty much the only extra cash you'll need to have saved up in the transport costs to the new city itself, and the amount of time you'll be without steady work. With the gig economy, you could start work in your new city day one while also hunting for a ""real"" job, which in this economic climate should take well under a month.

One person could move from any point in the continental US, to any other point in the continental US for under $1000, or about 80 hours of minimum wage. Just 5 extra hours a week, you'll have enough for moving expenses in about 4 months. 

It's not effortless, but it sure is easy."
