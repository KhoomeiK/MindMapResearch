I was planning on moving to a different job because I'd requested a raise to reflect the added workload hoisted on me. For three months I got the same answer, which was, ""We'll think about it."" They thought for too long and I took a sick day to have an interview. I told exactly one person why I was calling in sick and suddenly, the whole shop, including my bosses, knew what I was doing.

At first, I was pissed, but when I was called into the bosses office the next day, it was to give me a raise and a dollar per hour more than the other company offered me.

So in a way, it was a net gain. I learned I couldn't tell secrets to that guy and I got the raise I was looking for."

Naruto,fcw46nq,t1_fcw382v,1578016748.0,"But stressing over fictional characters is all I have to live for!

In all seriousness, I'm a powerscaler as a hobby, so I don't mind so much, when I'm in the mood and I'm talking to someone who actually knows what they're talking about. A heavily debated topic is The Last Naruto, using Six Paths, not just KCM+Sage Mode vs Three eyed Madara. Personally, I think Naruto wins, high difficulty by himself against Madara. Though, arguments for Madara winning aren't that far fetched, so it's actually pretty close. Power scaling fictional characters *can* be fun, but it usually isn't."
Naruto,fcw3066,t1_fcw2th4,1578015963.0,"Yeah, that exactly. I've seen this before.

Eleven times as a matter of fact.

Animemes,fcm1t75,t1_fcm0y9a,1577762011.0,"It took Goku an entire series to turn Frieza if you count DB super, but you're right. 

Problem is, Naruto finally used his full power talk no jutsu on Sasuke in that moment. That was the first opportunity he had to use his Six Paths Sage Mode enhanced TnJ on Sasuke. He even attempted it on Kaguya using an offshoot technique known as Sexy Jutsu, but we're not discussing that. We all know the Sexy Jutsu is the most OP in any universe.

See, we're talking full power TnJ and Sasuke didn't stand a chance against it.

Obviously it wouldn't work on Goku, since he's a good guy and TnJ only works on villains and main villains.

Knowing this fact and having typed it all out, I have to admit, Gokus is more powerful, because his version works on even friendlies."

Animemes,fclxjy4,t3_ehqp58,1577758914.0,"Alright, real talk. Who's talk no jutsu is more powerful, Narutos or Gokus.

I'm leaning towards Naruto, because he talked a dude into sacrificing himself to revive some people he killed, without the use of Dragon balls. However, Goku has talked almost every enemy over to his side. Tien, Piccolo, Vegeta, Buu(technically) and Beerus. So I can definitely see arguments for Gokus jutsu being more powerful. Thoughts?"

Naruto,fcj5ogn,t3_eh3n6c,1577677892.0,"Sorry man, but Madara doesn't stand a chance. Even if we take Zetsu out of the equation, who knows *everything* about Madara, he still dies in seconds, unless Kaguya tries to do the same thing that she tried with Naruto and take his chakra. In that case, I give him five minutes.

First off, Kaguya has some insane ability to hide her presence while teleporting around. She snuck up on NARUTO while he was in Six Paths Sage Mode. I still don't know how she did that, but she did. Madara gets pinned and his chakra siphoned and there's not much he can do about it.

All of the abilities he could use, she already has, since he got most of them from her. Truth seeking orbs, rinnegan powers, sharingan powers, Six Paths Sage Mode, Limbo, none of it will work on her.

I like Madara as much as the next guy(probably not as much as Swag though). I think he has the best character introduction in any anime, but he loses this fight really bad. Kaguya wins 9.9 times out of ten, low difficulty, even without Zetsus help."
