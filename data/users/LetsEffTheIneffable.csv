On the other hand, I think you might owe it to yourself as well as her to spend some time considering before you decide to cut ties with her forever. She was 13 at the time, and remember that our brains don't even fully mature until the mid-twenties.

Ask_Radical_Feminists,fenv0qf,t3_eq521k,1579291252.0,"I don't hate you at all. I'm very glad that you are finding that hormones make you happier and I hope the outcome continues to be that. I have no problem with you wearing dresses or makeup or acting in a traditionally feminine way. I will support your right to do that, and stand up for you to be treated fairly by the police and in employment situations despite not being traditionally masculine. I think adults should have the right to modify their bodies in whatever way they deem best, including hormones and surgery. 

I think gender is a social construct and I don't care at all which made up construct you ""identify"" as. Personally I don't care what pronouns you use and will do my best to honor whatever your choice is there if you inform me. I believe some other feminists disagree on this point as they see pronouns as reflecting innate sex, not gender, and I also support their right NOT to be forced to use pronouns with others that conflict with their understanding of reality.

However, I think gender and biological sex are different things. As much as I support you in being treated fairly regardless of which gender you feel most in alignment with, I believe we are born with a biological sex which is  unchangeable. Some in the Trans Rights Activist community demand that we pretend that sex can change, and that is delusional and not something I'll go along with. In addition I believe there are situations where biological sex is an important category and we need to continue to recognize that. I also think that encouraging gender-nonconforming children to see themselves as anything other than the sex they are is abusive. We need to support breaking down gender stereotypes, not move towards seeing them as pointers to someone's ""true"" sex.

I'd like to see transwomen and transmen really embrace who they are - a transwoman is a category of person different from ""woman"" with their own unique needs, experiences, and expression, deserving of respect on their own. We can advocate for transwomen to be safe and have a place in society without stepping on the rights and needs of women and girls."

A lot of times when I eat emotionally it's because I want to calm myself down or distract myself - so I have a list of alternative activities that are soothing or distracting. Third thing is to make sure I've physically distanced myself from impulsive emotional eating opportunities - that means I get myself out of the kitchen, make sure there are no snacks on my desk, etc. Finally, realize that the impulse to eat emotionally is kept alive by allowing yourself to repeatedly bring the image of food to mind.

GenderCritical,fdln9ms,t1_fdlmwfa,1578527883.0,"I'm transtemporal. Unlike all of you who live in the present tense, I live in an indefinite state of possibility and prefer to only be referred to in the subjunctive mood. If you refuse to use my preferred verb states, you are temporophobic."
Ask_Radical_Feminists,fdlmotd,t3_elzkgi,1578527501.0,"Teenagers play with identity in lots of ways. If my teen wanted to try different clothing styles, make-up, hair styles, pronouns, etc I would have no problem with that and support my child. I mean, I had a friend as a teen who made his parents call him ""liquid world"" lol ... I can certainly call my child him or her or ze or whatever.  I do not support children under 18 making significant changes to their bodies that have permanent consequences. Once they're an adult they get to make whatever choices they like. If my child seems to be dealing with body dysphoria or otherwise dealing with related mental suffering, I'd find them a competent therapist to help."
