AskReddit,ffq2mup,t1_ffnqehu,1580117005.0,"I will preface this first with the fact that in probably 99% of cases I agree with you, that a person should not have to face an ultimatum on who to spend time with as friends.  However, I have been in a position where the 1% of the time did occur.  

I had a friend who had a friend that was so toxic that every interaction with that person ended up with my friend in the ER either with heart palpitations, angina, or a few times ended up on a 72 hour psych hold after self-harming went too deep and the ER worried it was a suicide attempt lied about.  That case, as a group of friends, we _did_ step in and try to pull her from this other friend, just because she was killing herself with the stress of dealing with this other person. 

Normally I agree that an ultimatum doesn't work, and in fact as a group of friends we tried to not have it look like an ultimatum but instead tried to present to her the straight facts of what this person was doing to her.  However even with that, it really was to a point where we as a group of friends were tired of seeing her harm herself time and again after spending time with this other person, especially as it seemed that she always came to us to take care of her after spending time with that person.  Then again, several years later, she ended up pulling out of our lives anyway and accusing us of not paying enough attention to her.  

So perhaps to add to this, when a person is always the victim, no matter how many times you try to help empower them to do better."

MMORPG,ffgazjr,t1_ffeez6d,1579902271.0,"My husband and I the other night were talking about just this, but your point is one that we both forgot to bring up, the investment made over time.  

He and I have played GW2 since launch, which was back in 2012 now.  Before that, he had played WoW since launch as well, raiding on a very regular basis almost every single night of the week.  Back when WoW was new, it seemed to be more about the game and grinding up through the levels, taking time to learn it and research it, and working at it as a hobby in itself where it was likely the only game you were playing.  Even GW2 was like that for us - I remember hitting 7,000 hours played and was proud, feeling like I had mastered something by putting the time in, where in comparison, we have friends our age who log in, ask what game everyone wants to play that night, and they go play a different game every night of the week.  

The landscape overall has changed, and where it used to feel like games were meant to be played, it really has shifted to loot boxes, gold sales, and other ways to promote this secondary set of transactions around the game.  I know that studios need money to keep going, but at the same time, it really feels like the entire business model has shifted from focusing on the happiness of the consumer to instead focusing on the happiness of the shareholders.  Even GW2 with the change in leadership and NCSoft pushing down on ArenaNet, there's a push to sell stuff over a push to keep the game going, and it's sad in that way.  

So yes, where it used to feel like this unexplored landscape full of potential where we the consumer could go to escape, take part in a story, compete, and game, it now feel like it's about keeping up with the Joneses and buying all these secondary items instead.  Perhaps if even part of the development of the cash shop and loot box was spent on fixing other problems in these games, the market wouldn't be feeling like we're being sucked dry by CEOs in cash shops."

MMORPG,fdrtjha,t1_fdqjma5,1578689548.0,"> Even people running meta builds don't know how to play them. They deal more damage because they have the appropriate gear and appropriate skills, but not because they would have a deeper understanding of their class (many don't even know what skill rotation means) or what their skills do.

Even knowing the class, the meta is not always the best build for a player.  I honestly can do more damage on a target dummy in GW2 on my own Power Chrono DPS build than I can if I switch to something closer to the meta, which takes more time to learn and more time to master.  YES, I know the mechanics for said meta, but because I havent' spent seven years playing that specific role, it feels foreign under my hands.  I can do comparable damage to the meta in my own build as opposed to the lesser DPS I'd do in the meta build.

Even in WoW, I was ranked #3 on my server as an Arcane Mage during Wrath.  While they had meta builds required for most raids there too, in 2011 and earlier, I still out-DPSed people that used them using my own build and setup.  Just like my husband in WoW was a Mitigation tank while the meta was still Stamina.  He got a ton of slack because of it, yet outlasted all the Stam tanks we had and knew.

She always was going for the meta, always complaining about how necros were getting nerfed.  Yet, she was extremely high DPS, extremely good at her class, and was adaptable into any situation.  But because she was a necro, she was getting whispers telling her to leave the game and worse.  And it got to her because she thought she had to follow the meta, rather than play the game she wanted to all these years.  

In the time I've been in there, I've only changed my build really if I wanted to, not to follow the meta, but to find a way to kill shit as fast as I can and be survivable.

But I DO agree with what you say about how the meta developed.  It's how and why I avoid Fractals and Raids in there.  Toxicity is what kept me from learning how to PvP better (aside from a guildie who was really good at it and taught me some things).  My own build in there as a chronomancer works for me in PvE and WvW, but as soon as I get near any of the areas that require meta, I am eliminated too.

Guildwars2,fcvo66h,t1_fcvc4lt,1578006334.0,"And it's really hard to dodge in Skyrim.  I started playing it on the side after starting GW2 ages ago (I've been in GW2 since launch).  While I love Skyrim, my hands do not cooperate and keep going back to the key commands for GW2.  Even with swapping keybinds, which somehow breaks Skyrim for me then."
AskReddit,fcm6eih,t3_ehpvwl,1577765421.0,"I'd log into a web browser that I could redirect my IP address with, so that I could make it look like I am accessing the internet from another country.  I would then find photos of said country, photoshop myself into one or two of them, post them to social media using said web browser.  Then I'd log off everything, turn off everything that I could in my home, including my computer, tablet, and cell phone, and just spend two days in bed reading paperbacks."

There are so many beverages I can no longer drink without thinking of this.  Then again, knowing the sugar content and health consequences of so many beverages out there, I won't touch them either."

AskReddit,fcbfsjh,t1_fc922ve,1577586327.0,"When I worked at Walmart years ago (actually two decades now), I noticed that the music on the radio was on a two hour loop.  And most times I was up on the front end checkouts, but often enough I would be sent to zone the sales floor, or to stand at the checkout in lawn and garden.  During these times, I noticed very frequently on that two hour loop was the song ""Bye Bye Love,"" only it wasn't the normal version, I swear it was the version from ""All that Jazz.""  Looped probably in this case every HOUR."
AskReddit,fcbajgb,t1_fc9o7vv,1577584499.0,"Oh dear god this is wicked!  I have a partial hearing loss in one ear, and anything ASMR just grates my nerves, partly because I really have to concentrate to hear what is being done or said, but also partly because it's usually stuff that you don't want or need to hear.  

Then again, if it's a recording of a fan or someone typing quietly, or anything equivalent to white noise such as a train, rain, or sound of traffic, that would put me to sleep."
AskReddit,fcba1qk,t1_fc92qt3,1577584320.0,"I DO have tinnitus and if I am in too quiet of a place, it drive me nuts, to a point where I need a fan going to drown out the sound at all times, especially to sleep.  Even worse, I did a sound test thing in college complete with sitting in a soundproof booth, where not only did I hear my tinnitus, I also heard my heart beating.  It was incredibly strange and unnerving to hear what I would normally only be able to hear with a stethoscope."

I lived near where ""Public Enemies"" was partly filmed, and all the news outlets knew where filming was happening, as did police and such.  Most community members knew, and even during times that they were not filming, we were allowed to walk around the downtown renovations they did for the set.  For example, the cobblestone that was seen was actually rubber mats placed down on normal concrete."
