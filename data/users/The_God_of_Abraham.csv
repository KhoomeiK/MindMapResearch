science,feonty2,t1_feojjs4,1579302690.0,"Could be that, or any number of other factors. This study sounds like a trainwreck:

> For the purposes of this study, the authors defined minority serving hospitals two ways. The first definition defined such hospitals as having twice as many minority patients as expected based on the percentage of African American or Hispanic living in the region according to the U.S. Census. The second defined a minority serving hospital as having more than 25 percent of its ICU patients identify as African American or Hispanic. The different definitions yielded similar results.

If we work the numbers backwards, we can deduce that essentially all of the hospitals in the first definition are  in low(er) minority areas. Blacks and Hispanics tether are 28% of the national population, so any locally representative pool of patients in a nationally representative areas (or higher) would fall under the second definition as well.

And that first definition is very interesting. Odd, actually. *Twice* as many minority patients as expected by regional population? I can only think of two cases that satisfy that criteria: ""ghetto"" facilities in the middle of high-density minority neighborhoods that aren't representative of the larger region...and facilities in overwhelmingly white areas in which--wait for it--minorities are *twice as likely to be critically ill* as the white residents.

and you're not better off than when you started. The difference between diseases, and the severity of individual cases, isn't easily quantifiable.

Also (IIRC) there *is* evidence that having a dental professional floss your teeth prevents cavities, just not that doing it yourself prevents them. But again, that's probably about a) lack of good studies, and b) people doing really obviously half-ass jobs of flossing themselves.

Personally, I'm going to keep flossing. There's no question that letting food build up on the visible surfaces of your teeth (i.e., not brushing) feeds the bacteria that cause cavities. So it's pretty reasonable to assume that the same thing is going to happen on the *non*-visible surfaces of your teeth as well."

If you're looking for exceptions for young-but-similarly-aged partners, the age goes as low as 11(!) in the US (and [12 in some countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_age_of_consent).) 

14 and 15 are still common consent ages for minor/adult relationships, as long as the adult isn't in a position of authority over the minor. So a teacher can't bang their 14yo student...but a stranger can drive past the school and bang a 14yo they convinced to get in their car.

Weird. But common! And common in places we typically consider socially progressive."
todayilearned,feff0ei,t3_eov5jg,1579054930.0,"It's interesting to consider legal differences between states in a case like this. The girl was 17 at the time. Virginia is one of very few states that sets the age of consent at 18. A large majority of states set it at 16, and there are a few that set it at 17.

The global average is around 16, though many European nations set it at 15 or even 14. The most socially liberal nations all set it between 14 and 16.

It's kind of amusing to watch many of the same people on Reddit who consider themselves socially progressive suddenly show their Puritanical roots when it comes to sex. Not only would this situation be legal in most of the world, it would be legal in most of the rest of the country. But people act like 18 is some sort of universal, objective moral line."

This is the problem with libertarian puritanism. It can't accept that there's a necessary compromise between principle and practice.

ANY capability of any sort can be misused by anyone. That's just physics, in the end. The question is how to make compromises that are *acceptable* to principle, even if principle isn't enthusiastic about them. 

However, like I said, I don't believe that backdoors (as currently conceived) are that acceptable compromise."

That's the central problem with every backdoor system I've encountered: at some point in the decryption chain, breaking it for *every* key is only marginally more difficult than breaking it for *one* key, which makes the system as a whole fragile. If that point gets compromised, the entire product collapses. Public key encryption was explicitly designed—by being *de*centralized, among other things—to *not* have such a point of weakness, and centralized backdoors can only work by reverting the entire system to a less robust model."
