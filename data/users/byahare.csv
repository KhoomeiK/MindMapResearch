Endo,ffxhxe9,t3_evncg8,1580325494.0,"I've never wanted kids or had any interest in having kids whatsoever. It was never even a conscious decision or lightbulb moment - kids were always something that was not going to happen.

At 20, I got diagnosed with a slew of genetic disorders and disabling conditions branching from those. That concreted any (non existant, honestly) doubt I had.

Then I started realizing my symptoms also line up with endo and that just poured more concrete on it. I really truly hope that I'm naturally infertile, but I'm planning on getting that finalized with sterilization surgery to remove any doubt or ""miracles""."

I used my carpet cleaner often in college, and when a friend knocked over their bottle of alcohol on my carpet I went straight for the carpet cleaner. Took it right out. I wasn't going to waste paper towels and time for something that I knew wouldn't be effective"

Fuck that. His behavior is NOT your responsibility  and this behavior needs to be taken seriously without any doubt.

You cannot hold yourself responsible for his choices, his behavior, or the consequences of either of the above. This needs to be reported and that's the responsible choice not the extreme one."

Shitty jokes are not funny. They can be toxic. So kindly fuck off and stop making the community that supports healthy, safe, consensual kink look bad."
creepyPMs,fde0g2i,t1_fddvkmk,1578328365.0,"Well considering children shouldn't be in sexual contact anyways, that *is* what the rule is for.

14's half plus 7 is still 14. 20, you get 17. Once it's to an age where starting any relationship and interest in a partner is acceptable, it starts working"
creepyPMs,fde00tq,t1_fdd05ar,1578328080.0,"I'm not shaming someone for the ways they enjoy sex with a consenting and eager partner - I'm shaming them for fucking scaring an unwilling party, that they don't know well, haven't established any consent or boundaries with, and clearly have no intentions to do so.

This message isn't about kink. It's about taking what you want from another person without any consent or respect for them."
