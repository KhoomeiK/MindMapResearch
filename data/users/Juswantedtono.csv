AskReddit,fezrykd,t1_feybf8v,1579460881.0,"> I think a wealth tax that makes people like Bezos divest a little bit at a time through taxation is a good idea 

I don’t see how that would work. In order to tax Bezos’ wealth, we’d have to force him to give up some of his Amazon stock every year, progressively reducing his influence over the company. I don’t think that’s what we really want: he’s a passionate and innovative man who works crazy hard, and we want him to have power over his company so that he’s motivated to make it grow. I’d rather him have that power than the government, because government is notoriously inefficient at running any kind of business. 

When he *chooses* to sell his stock and cash out, that’s when we should tax him. And I’m all for increasing the capital gains tax rate so that it at least matches the income tax rate. But the idea of forcing him to give control of Amazon to the government just seems ridiculous to me."
