AskReddit,fft5m5e,t3_ev3y9w,1580208350.0,"My suicide attempt. I battled with massive depression , self harm, alcoholism, addiction for over a decade and finally two years ago I overdosed. When I woke up, my depression had all but disappeared. It may have something to do with the brain injury that I got from the overdose where I have a lot of memory issues and I have forgotten many horrible memories. I still have mild depression but it’s manageable with medication. Ironically, if I hadn’t tried to kill myself I would be still majorly depressed and self harming and drinking myself to death."

You are such a warrior woman who has so much more strength than you possibly could realise. You are an inspiration for those who are still struggling with dark thoughts and the fact that you made it through, is such a wonderful thing to celebrate. Your husbands confusion has nothing to do with you, and you should not hold any guilt about his confusion. You are so brave to hold yourself together when you have felt like falling apart. Your strength is so admirable. I’m amazed by you, and prouder than I can articulate. I’m sending you internet hugs."
