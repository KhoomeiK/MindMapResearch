I'd say a clean diet lifestyle and regular weight lifting and cardio is the best anti aging medicine available."
nattyorjuice,fffmqg2,t1_ffcfbot,1579887295.0,Hgh in the amounts most juicers use will age you even more long term.
nattyorjuice,fffmitg,t3_et6yk2,1579887163.0,I honestly think he may be natty. He's not ridiculously shredded (tbh i doubt he could get shredded even with juice given how fat he was)
nattyorjuice,fffm6qt,t3_et2yr9,1579886958.0,Bet he snores like a pig
nattyorjuice,fffm2q8,t1_ffcqhe2,1579886891.0,You went from anorexic to fat.. That's like what a lot of girls with eating disorders do. Can't be healthy for you regardless.
fatlogic,fffelha,t3_etbx85,1579882266.0,It's a bit like how former drug addicts or smokers become anti-drugs
nattyorjuice,ffctmmn,t1_ffcpq1o,1579807013.0,"They've only ever caught a couple of people for PEDs. I suspect they dont want to, but if they did catch them they would probably suspend them for a season or so. 

TBH the top players are probably using currently undetectable susbtances anyway."
nattyorjuice,ffcm5jp,t1_ffcirns,1579802387.0,"Mate you have the genetics of a carrot, the fact you jumped on sarms or whatever straight away and ate crap for 9 months isn't impressive. I don't doubt your numbers but it's obvious you were on juice from the off to achieve that weight gain. Not all of us were born yesterday."
nattyorjuice,ffce56r,t1_ffbmjq8,1579797510.0,He's not natty..
nattyorjuice,ffce137,t3_esnt06,1579797440.0,Pep Guardiola is widely suspected to have known about PED use at Barcelona and probably Man City. Liverpool are their biggest rivals. I would say almost all of the Premier League's top players are at least on test.
nattyorjuice,ffcbjfx,t1_ffc1jaw,1579795885.0,No you weren't haha.. you were a twig. Juicy from the off.
nattyorjuice,ffbk09s,t1_ffat2z4,1579768949.0,You're a juicy kid yourself.. You don't have a clue about training naturally bud.
fatlogic,ff7abna,t1_ff79u1w,1579644511.0,"Very true

I eat relatively healthily these days ever since i decided to cut out the excess sugar in my diet that my genius father introduced me too many years ago, but I still have sugary cereal and a few small doughnuts each day. The difference is I burn it off and am not in denial about what i eat."
nattyorjuice,ff7a136,t3_eryd1d,1579644267.0,"Horrible haircuts, punchable faces


Juice!!"
nattyorjuice,ff79wza,t1_ff6tita,1579644174.0,Is it gay to wear lippy wig & dress and get pounded by big bodybuilders?
nattyorjuice,ff79p4s,t1_ff6p7vn,1579644013.0,"Most prisoners aren't there because they have the patience and determination to follow strict diet, training and lifestyle changes. Most non white collar criminals are impulsive and often not too intelligent. Drug addiction therefore is rife in prison.

They all juice in prison if steroids are available."
fatlogic,ff75ik6,t3_erux8f,1579641530.0,"They're always healthy, yet are on numerous medications and sold their house to spend all their time at the doctors surgery.. 

Do they ever think that the reason they are on all these medications is because they have led unhealthy lifestyles all their lives?"
