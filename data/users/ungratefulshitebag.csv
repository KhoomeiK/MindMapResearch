I do sit on the side of ""more people regret kids than admit it"" but that study is laughable and proves nothing"
AmItheAsshole,ff9t5lv,t1_ff9rbj4,1579720702.0,"7% is definitely not most.
And a study where they've looked at comments on Reddit isn't exactly top notch"
AmItheAsshole,ff9sojz,t3_esd1z8,1579720393.0,"NTA.
People need to stop pretending that regretting having kids is a rare thing. It's really not, lots of people regret having kids. 

You can love your kids, make sure they get everything they want and need and know you'd do anything to make them happy but still regret having them. Doesn't make you a bad person or a bad mum, it makes you human. Lots of people feel like that.

If you told your kids you feel like that you'd be an ass though."
AmItheAsshole,ff47bvu,t3_ericew,1579557124.0,ESH. You left your child to go to bed hungry just so you could one up your husband - that's petty and spiteful and the only person who lost here was your daughter.

By far the best tutorials out there, she's awesome"
todayilearned,fd1aqg9,t1_fczq46k,1578129270.0,"No he wasn't delayed verbally, it just gave him a helping hand when he knew what he wanted to say but wasn't able to say it. He said his first word (mama) when he was around 11 months old which is pretty average.

We did Makaton which is a simplified version and where you're specifically supposed to say the word along with the action. Before he could speak he would use the action. Then when he started to speak he would use the action and the word. Then after a while would just use the word.

I do think that for those parents who put their all into it and really work at it it is a brilliant thing. I started later than most parents do (he was about 8 months) and was quite lazy with it because of starting so late. I didn't teach him nearly as much as I could have done. But I still found it very useful and he seemed to benefit a lot from it.

It's frustrating for babies to be unable to tell you what they need. Giving them a way to do that before they can verbalise it is a good thing. And you don't realise until you give them a way to communicate how helpful it is."
todayilearned,fd18vd2,t1_fczm8n2,1578128719.0,"Yes, I do. Before he could speak, he could tell me what he wanted while babies his age couldn't. That was massively helpful and I think it was good for him."
todayilearned,fczbdux,t1_fcz6wda,1578097508.0,"My son is 11 now and even when he was a baby using sign language was encouraged. The children's centre in my town ran baby sign language classes I went to once a week to teach Makaton. I loved to see how well he could communicate even though he couldn't actually speak.

Admittedly I was a bit lazy with it and didn't teach him as much as I could do. But he could tell me that he wanted milk etc. And other random things as well from sticking him in front of Mr Tumble whenever I wanted a shower."

I have a high sex drive, lots of women do - that doesn't make us sperm dumpsters or mean there's something wrong with us as you seem to be implying with your post or your replies.

Wanting daily sex is not a weird or outrageous thing"
