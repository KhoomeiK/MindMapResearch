I don't know.

Britain could go down, economically speaking. Then by some sort of domino effect trigger a euro wide recession, or bigger.

europe,ffus9tr,t1_ffuqd6o,1580248402.0,"Separatism is a huge problem in Spain. You are right. In France? Not anymore. The Basque, ""breton"" and Corsican independentist never reached the point it could actually happen, then pretty much disappeared. France's independentist movements are pretty much nowadays  just stickers on the back of your car and ""edgy"" comments from teenagers on reddit.

So if all the other big countries tell Spain to deal with it, plus ""we will give you ""x"" in exchange"" they could pretty well agree."

europe,ffuhci7,t3_ev9o6h,1580241968.0,"I can't predict the future, but the way I see it.

First Brexit finally happens.


Over 5, 10 years, UK economy slowly erodes. Why would a japanese company make cars in the UK, where you will have some kind of taxes shipping them to mainland Europe, rather than the other way around, having just the UK customers pay extra? Why would finance and insurance companies not move to mainland Europe?

So the independance movements gain traction and at some point Scotland and Northern Ireland leave the UK.

End of story the United Kingdom becomes just England, with Wales.

The dream of a UK freed from being somehow held back by the EU and being back to a world power ends up in shambles, with little britain asking to get back to EU membership.

Very long process. It finally happens.

And guess what? Somehow Brits blame the EU for this mess and keep messing with the advances EU plans to do.

TLDR: I don't think marrying back the wife you divorced will end up nicely. 

UK spent 40 years dragging their feet about anything EU related. 

I'm all for a united Ireland into EU, an independent Scotland into EU. If there is a referendum of some sort in a distant future no way I'm letting the delusional Brits back in."

Whatcouldgowrong,ffo638r,t1_ffmsgx2,1580074471.0,"As the other commenter said: a french speaking country. 

That could be France, Belgium or Switzerland. 

But the sun looks harsh, and the dirt on the right side quite dry. So probably not Belgium. 

The bright sun could be because this is high up in the mountains, so Switzerland, but they aren't the kind of people that run red lights. 

So that would be France. Woohoo.

According to the shadow of the road side barrier, the sun seems quite vertical in the sky, for european latitudes, so that would be southern France.

Southern France seem legit for careless driving..."

ArchitecturalRevival,ffm7hep,t1_ffjtpm9,1580049743.0,"Well, the castle was built starting in the XVth century so obviously no plumbing back then. Plumbing and electricity where added later on on those castles, if you visit there will be lightbulbs and toilets, now. 

Regarding the row of houses: probably no plumbing, when built. But they are clearly from different time period, would need a closer look to identify actual age of the houses."
france,ffm65ns,t1_fflxsck,1580049220.0,">Quoi t'aime pas Castlevania ? Et puis le hdr c'est un virage colorimétrique en français rien de plus ça va.

Non. Un virage colorimétrique c'est jouer avec ""teinte/saturation"" dans Photoshop pour avoir par exemple un effet sépia de vieille photographie.

HDR c'est initialement superposer des photo identiques sous-ex, normale et surex pour éclaircir les zones d'ombres et foncer les zones de hautes lumières. Mais maintenant ce sont des filtres qui, utilisés avec trop d'intensité, donnent des résultats absolument gerbants. Voir r/shittyhdr

Perso cette photo est beaucoup trop filtrée à mon goût, alors que la photo brute était probablement superbe.

Je suis choqué par l'attrait actuel pour les filtres excessifs, voir le fait qu'ils ne sont même pas reconnus comme tel par des redditeurs/internetteurs qui n'ont connu que la photo numérique, vu leur jeune âge."

One of the steps in teenage years is to make fun of those taboo things, to prove they are adults.

Case in point horror movies are teenagers' favorites, rather than for adults.

This stupid prank is typical of what a teenager would love to do, or actually toy with the idea of doing. It is somewhat related to sex, related to blood, disgusting, etc
