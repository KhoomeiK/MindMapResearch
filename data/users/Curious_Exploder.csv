politics,ff8bw68,t1_ff88poq,1579672282.0,"They're not sheep, they're just one issue voters. They are convinced abortion is murder, if you literally think a baby is being murdered and a party is advocating people should have the right to kill their babies, would you ever vote for them? I don't agree with the framing of that position, but you should try to empathize with it. It's an incorrect belief, but if that is your belief it's a horrific thought that you would allow this to happen.  If you're not politically engaged you don't need to give a shit about anything else, you're not going to vote for the party that supports murdering babies.  [Why do you think Republicans staunchly support this position even though the majority of their party doesn't want Roe v. Wade overturned?](https://www.npr.org/2019/06/07/730183531/poll-majority-want-to-keep-abortion-legal-but-they-also-want-restrictions)  They get to lock up probably 30% of the popular vote without even trying. The other portion of the party doesn't really care, they prefer Roe v. Wade stays but it's not the main issue that they are picking their politicians over. All the Republican politicians care about is maintaining their power so they can keep lining their pockets as well as their friend's pockets. They are old rich white guys, and most of them don't give a shit about having abortions, they'll never need one and neither will their rich children. And even if their children do need one, they can just fly them to a country where it's legal and they can get one on the DL.

It all makes sense, the main issue is the two party system, the whole structure of how power is appointed in the country is now completely broken. How can anyone think a duopoly is the best way of providing a service which is representation? Any balance in the system has been eroded away for a very long time now, and all the Republican's seem to do is fight dirty and muddy the waters."

The animals already have to have the adaptation that allowed them them to survive this--it's not going to occur randomly in offspring--and that adaptation will have to be for reasons that are not related to this event. So it's a 'coincidental' adaptation.  

Off the top of my head, the only adaptation that will really be of much use in this circumstance is intelligence because that usually means the animal is more adaptable to varying environments.  The animal already needs to be intelligent though.  Anything that is fit into a super specific niche isn't going to survive if that environment is too perturbed.

So according to Google (hehe) it takes 0.04 kilowatt-hours (kWh) to boil an electric kettle.

And the reports vary but it seems that Google receives 63,000 searches a ~~day~~ **second**, that comes out to 1.988 trillion searches per year.

So

1.988 trillion * 0.04 kWh = 79,525,152,000 kWh

Which is roughly the the energy usage of either the entire country of Venezuela or Belgium being used every year just searching on google.

The whole world uses about 21.y trillion kWh per year so if that is actually true then approximately 79.5 billion/21.7 trillion = 0.00365, 0.36% of our global energy usage is for Google Searches.  This seems absurdly high to me.

This is a simplistic view of the matter. You might still be right in terms of the overpay, but the way you justified it with regards to the $700k players doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  You're speaking about Cost Per Point as if it's the most important factor in determining the value of each contact.  This is simply not the case because then if you built your team around that metric you would just aim to sign as many of the the best League Minimum goal scoring players as you can.  The other limiting factor is Time. You only have a limited number of minutes per game in which you can spend your players.  This means players that produce at a higher number of points-per-minute are a lot more important. The higher the points-per-minute the rarer the player is, so because there are a limited number of high point-per-minute-players ***you will absolutely need to pay the best players in the league*** ***more*** ***per point***.  

You should care about the Cost per Points/20Minutes or Cost per Points/Game.

And if you don't believe me, then explain why every contact in the [Top 100 of Cost Per Point](https://www.capfriendly.com/cost-per-point) of that linked list is paid less than or equal to $2,000,000.

Additionally the more elite players are playing against much more difficult match ups.

And newer contracts on the best players are absolutely worse because they are being paid term, whereas worse players are just on short 1 year deals so they are being paid for just right now.  You're looking at essentially a bunch of final year contract players and then comparing them to the front of the Marner deal when we know there is an upwards cap ceiling drift over time.

Unbelievably good from our minimum wage guys? We have 3 players in the top 100 in a league of 31 teams. I don't know how you consider that to be unbelievable, it looks about appropriate, maybe a bit above average because if you expect us the average to have players around the 15th, 46th, and 77th, we have them in the 23rd, 34th, and 45th.

Obviously goals-against per minute is going to factor into this as well but that's harder to measure."
