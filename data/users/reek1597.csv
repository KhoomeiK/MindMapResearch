“Ran out of drugs I feel like it’s the end I’m on the bench. 
“You say you love me I’m not holding your hand”"
JuiceWRLD,ff5b2pr,t1_ff5b0xo,1579585798.0,How does it go?

SuicideWatch,fe5bdqb,t1_fe59isg,1578867305.0,You’re not a shitty person. You didn’t bother me. I’m alone doing nothing. You can y’all to me pm me if you need to say anything personal.
SuicideWatch,fe5ax6b,t1_fe580c9,1578867183.0,You’re right. I’m not God but God made a decision for you to still be here. He chose for it not to be your time. I know how it feels to want to die. I been through dark times still going through them but if it’s a light somewhere I want to see it. And I want to help others that want to be helped to know that all darkness sees light.  And in your case I listened I seen what you posted so I wanted to let you know that I see you and I understand how you feel. I don’t want to antagonize you I want to encourage you that’s all. If I upset you I apologize. I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable. If you ever need to talk I’m here. I’ll leave out anything that would come off as cliche.
SuicideWatch,fe58f3a,t1_fe58753,1578866560.0,Yes I do because we are all energy and you don’t have to be physically with someone to show that you care. We all need a shoulder to lean on no matter who or where it comes from.
SuicideWatch,fe584p1,t3_enscwk,1578866470.0,Best news I got in a loooooonggg time. 🌟🌟
SuicideWatch,fe56msp,t1_fe537jg,1578866070.0,Please be ok. You have officially said something to me and it would hurt me to hear any bad news from you. It hurts me that you feel how you feel. Like I said I may not know you but without any doubt I love you. I pray that everything works in your favor. Just know that no matter what you think somebody cares. I get those same thoughts and I force myself to think about the good things. Live for the good days.
SuicideWatch,fe55q7s,t1_fe52or2,1578865878.0,"I stick by what I said. I have love for everyone even the people who did me wrong. I don’t have to know someone to love them. I can love the qualities of someone, I can love the though of someone. One thing we all have in this thread is that we all have been or are still going through something that makes us feel the way we do. You can’t devalue anything I said because you don’t know my heart. The empathy I feel for others including people I don’t know has been my biggest barrier. I love people more than I love myself and I would sacrifice myself to save a stranger any day of the year and any second of an hour. So please don’t say my words mean nothing because they do. I’m sorry that you feel the way you do."
SuicideWatch,fe54hwi,t1_fe51uzr,1578865559.0,You have to understand that it has to be some truth to a platitude. It’s not being said for fun. I have problems too. I’m sorry if my empathy upsets you but that is the person I am. Like I said I’m the biggest fuck up but I will never be a gatekeeper based off the simple fact that if my words can change the thoughts of one person I did my job. Encouragement is helpful. It helped me so I’m passing it on. Like I said I truly believe that you will see brighter days. Your “young years” may have gone but you’re still breathing and I look at that as a blessing. Be a testimony. Don’t give up to soon I don’t know how old you are but you’re not old enough to die. Just keep trying. I won’t persuade you to doing something you don’t want to do but I will never pass over someone who’s calling for help. Like I said I’m here for you no matter how you feel.
SuicideWatch,fe4zzl9,t3_enqks5,1578864390.0,OP please say that you’re fine at least for a few days. Say something please.
SuicideWatch,fe4zu3l,t1_fe4yl9h,1578864336.0,Your life isn’t meant to be over. Rewrite the story change the ending. I’m glad you failed. I’m glad you commented. Take it from me nobody can be a bigger fuck up than me. Your life is worth living. Keep fighting I know it’s hard but you’re a warrior and I know you’ll get through the hard times. If you need to talk about anything I’m here.
SuicideWatch,fe4xgqe,t1_fe3ukps,1578863739.0,Please tell me you wear a size 11 because we are definitely walking in the same shoes. I want you to know that with time you’re going to get better. I’m 22(m)I feel the same way as you. I am here to stop you. Find something you love you can escape the pain for hours once you find your bliss. Every time I think of self harm I think of the faces of people who care about me even when I feel like I’m alone I know it’s people who care no matter how much I try to ignore it. I don’t want to burden my friends and family because I decided to end my own. You’re gonna get better just keep working on yourself and remember tomorrow is a new day to start over. You got this.
SuicideWatch,fe4wcb3,t1_fe4f8nx,1578863404.0,That’s not true. I love you and I don’t even know you  You are loved. As long as you have yourself you’re loved. I know how it feels to get blinded by your thoughts. Whenever you feel low think about one of your favorite day’s that you can remember. Think about the things and people that made that day so special. We are all here to serve a purpose. Chase your bliss. Everything is going to get better. I promise you. Keep fighting.
SuicideWatch,fe4vakk,t3_enqks5,1578863126.0,"Please don’t. I’m in the same situation, from being let down countless times to being -315 dollars with rent due in two weeks. It’s going to get better for you. It’s cliche but it’s true. We’re going to look back at these hard times and smile knowing we made it through. Dying is easier than living so I challenge you to keep fighting. You’re a warrior. Don’t give up you made it this far. I think it’s safe to say that You’ve been fighting 4 years, tomorrow may be the day that things change for the better for you. If nobody said they love you I do. I love that we both feel the same way inside. I love that you’re fighting a battle and have been fighting for 4 years. I love the way that you had the courage to pour out your emotions on here. I had the worst panic attack of my life in front of my mom on Christmas Day. I prayed that she never had to see me that way I told her I wanted to kill myself and I wish someone would “shoot me in my fucking head. ” I wasn’t in my right mind but I seen the look of sadness in her eyes. Seeing the hurt in her made me think about staying a little longer. Life’s like a seesaw we get our ups and downs but when we get off it’s in a neutral position. Tomorrow is a fresh start you got this. Stay alive not only for your family and people you care about. Do it for yourself. Pain creates the best art. I believe in you don’t cut yourself short. You’re breakthrough is coming."
aldi,fdnuze9,t3_cvqfvu,1578593380.0,How’d yours go? I have one on Monday as well as another job opportunity that would coexist with the time slot they want me to show face at this event. Is it worth it to attend?
Saints,fdg5eae,t3_ekjb9w,1578380704.0,Rise Up!!
Madden,fdg50pm,t1_fdetckn,1578380271.0,He deserved one on release but not Matt Ryan? I don’t agree. Matt has one of the best seasons last year and he only came in with a superstar ability. Not fair at all.
SuicideWatch,fct3hfx,t1_fcpsqv2,1577931909.0,That’s why I said “not sure if you’re spiritual or not” you know.
SuicideWatch,fcpfjzw,t1_fcn7xd1,1577861770.0,How old are you? Life is worth living. You get a chance to do everything that you didn’t do yesterday tomorrow. You’ll make it out. I know depression is a dark hole but you will crawl out I believe in you. I wanted to kill myself but once I had a panic attack in front of my mom and I seen how it effected her I knew I had to fight a little longer. I don’t know if I would ever fully be fine but I do know that glimmer of hope and the sadness I seen in my moms eyes was enough for me to stay longer. I ruin every relationship I have but I know it’s just for the time being. Not sure if you’re spiritual or not but God has to have a plan for those like us. Happy New Year
