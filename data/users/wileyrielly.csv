How was that 6 months? Any tips to get through? 

And how did you feel afterwards? 

I've been low carb/keto for a few years now.. I love me some fat... hopefully that'll help mitigate the zero carb adaption phase."
zerocarb,ff9n02i,t1_ff9lrxp,1579716398.0,yeah I've heard. Seems that its the chloride ions released from potassium chloride (litesalt); hence why I opted for citrate which apparently is easier on the ol' gut.

I was pooping a hell of alot less (basically not at all) and just felt like all the waste my body produces was accumulating.. 

Perhaps this zero carb for 5/6 days is best for me.. 

I'll never shy away from a challenge if there is reward however... 

what does a typical days worth of food look like for you? Whats your go to meal?

How do you manage electrolyes?"

Are you saying that its normal to feel completely drained? Like seriously freakin' fatigued... I dont mind discomfort, but the feeling feels like i'm seriously lacking something... Sleep becomes horrible and I the colour from my face is drained... If you're certain that its an envitible bump then i'll power through it."

AskReddit,ff915tb,t3_es5sb8,1579702237.0,"I was never suicidal but was feeling pretty gosh darn terribly low. 

One of the biggest pieces of advice i'll always stand by is switching to a ketogenic diet.

The word diet doesnt inspire much confidence in depressed people becuase they most likely have tried switching to a healthy diet with no success. 

The keto diet is more like a revolution on a cellular-metabolic level; which has outstanding cognitive effects; way more so than a diet that suggests simply ""eating more greens and less sugar"". 

A ketogenic diet resticts carbs and increases fat which encourages the body to produce ketone bodies; which our brains evolved to run on; its only relatively recent in the agricultural age that we got alot of out energy from starch/sugar. 

I think part of the diets brilliant effects is how it affects your gut biome; some people believe it helps rebalance your gut bacteria by starving out the sugar-eating bad bacteria that just have no place in our digestive system.

It also gives you tonnes of energy which facilitates exercise (V. important IMO, but impossible to sustain if you're constantly fatigued).

Brain fog/ anxiety/ dread will melt away.

You might think its too good to be true but it does exact its price; its hard work resiting sugar and doing enough research to make it viable, although theres alot of help online and on r/keto.

Just a little breadcrumb for yo'lls - Feel free to message me."

todayilearned,ff5qok8,t1_ff4m3y9,1579606374.0,I personally think reposting TILs and other pices of information is fine; You're not ripping off anybody. I think reposting is only bad when somebody puts effort into making something and another steals it and claims ownership (implicitly or otherwise).
