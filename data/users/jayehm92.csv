CasualConversation,ffddl6z,t3_esux4p,1579818644.0,"I have 8 and they have all different kinds of names. Johnny, June, Poof, Karma, Aura, Iris, Andi, and Phantom. The last two are the only one's that came pre-named because they were rescues. They all have a bunch of nicknames too."

CrazyIdeas,ffbqo8i,t3_esop63,1579778845.0,Mine would be my boyfriend anyways. We both listen to the same music together all day.

learnart,ff5vzqc,t1_ff5v5f8,1579612121.0,Came here to say this lol
OCD,ff5ucxa,t1_ff5t7rd,1579610553.0,"As someone who lives with a schizophrenic, you are very wrong. All this post is describing is intrusive thoughts and many different mental illnesses have them including OCD and schizophrenia. If you are assuming this would be more relatable to someone who is schizophrenic due to the violent nature of it, please do some research and learn about things before you comment. Schizophrenia does not instantly equal violent. I am sorry that stigma has taught you this."
cats,ff40zch,t3_ere8ga,1579553176.0,Having almost the same amount of cats in my house this is my absolute worse nightmare. I am so sorry for loss but so so happy you found the one that was missing!
IWantOut,ff3h4af,t3_erepkt,1579540907.0,I don't have any advice for you but I wish you luck! My brothers wife moved to Northern Ontario from California and even with a immigration lawyer they had huge difficulties. She almost wasn't allowed and was denied once. She ended up moving to a border town in Minnesota for 2 years and once they were married it took almost another 6 months before she was allowed to stay.
tuckedinkitties,fey90zx,t3_eqsoaq,1579442317.0,I have 8 cats and 3 of them are under the blanket with me and I have to pee. Send help.
AskReddit,few1ya1,t3_eqies2,1579404347.0,"I was out at my family cabin when I was around 17 or 18. I went to bed earlier than everyone and they all partied the night away. I woke up really early in the morning, I knew this because the sun was coming up. Who ever was last to bed forgot to turn the music down and an extremely psychedelic song was on the radio, think Pink Floyd but like, experimental Pink Floyd. I really wanted to go and turn it down but the big problem I was having preventing me from doing that is that I had to figure out how to get from the ceiling back in to my body. I woke up feeling like I was floating and I could see myself sleeping in the bed. I closed my eyes and internally screamed. I opened them again I was laying in bed in the exact position I seen myself in. It was probably a dream but it was really freaky since I have always been able to tell when I am dreaming, except for then."

unpopularopinion,fejmaed,t3_ep9up9,1579179685.0,My boyfriend is schizophrenic and weed is a big no no for him. Instant psychosis.
Alexisonfire,feip2qr,t1_feimyll,1579143711.0,"Asked my friend, she says that's definitely who they came here with but not sure what venue it was."
Alexisonfire,feincmd,t1_feimyll,1579142565.0,"That definitely rings a bell from conversations I've had with others. I have a friend who went to their first tbay show, I'll ask them."
Alexisonfire,feijz1z,t1_fei4s7r,1579140287.0,"No I do not, sorry!"
Alexisonfire,feh1b25,t1_feh0tzk,1579107062.0,"I've seen them a few times. Every time they've come to Thunder Bay excluding the first time. I really want to see them again but can't afford to travel right now it sucks! See them every chance you can get, they're just as amazing every time."
ThunderBay,feg67wk,t3_eoqx3p,1579078862.0,If you're able to travel and are on the south side businesses in Kakabeka are always hiring. I did it for a while and the drive takes just as much time as it does to go across town.
CasualConversation,fefhi06,t3_eolpwf,1579056429.0,I have 8 and I feel this way about every one of them. Even turned my boyfriend in to a cat person.
cats,fec0s51,t3_eo7ydp,1578964955.0,She looks like my Poof's twin so yaaass your kitty is absolutely adorable
aww,feb851h,t1_feayozq,1578956267.0,Yes I do lol
aww,fea8ho7,t1_fe9ep50,1578945608.0,The person I adopted my CHer from named her Andi after Andy Capp. It was such a perfect name I kept it
aww,fe9it8i,t1_fe98kck,1578937862.0,"I also have a cat with CH. She is moderate and very rarely has big crashes. It does happen once in a while but you are definitely correct when you say they know their limits. I have 7 other ""normies"" and they crash in to stuff more than she does."
gifs,fdqsnzq,t3_emrntg,1578674030.0,I wonder if I'll see this posted somewhere else tomorrow morning too. 3rd morning in a row now lol
tifu,fdqmlwq,t3_emlnqo,1578670251.0,"If you continue to have strong reactions like this stop smoking. This sounds like the exact reaction my boyfriend used to have years ago to weed and he is schizophrenic. If you ever feel like you're losing touch with reality when you smoke or if you have a hard time believing what's true/real or not, don't smoke it again, it could be triggering psychosis."
aww,fdq3b29,t3_emklv2,1578652789.0,I am in a facebook group based out of Canada and they are sewing all different sizes of joey pouches and knitting birds nests all to send to Australia. It's amazing how many people are doing it
gifs,fdoahf4,t3_emaxji,1578601687.0,"My dad used to do freestyle skiing in his younger years so I sent him this. He replied with ""Been there, done that"". Last time I try to show him something cool"
CatTaps,fdifp19,t1_fdiekcv,1578441856.0,Mine seems to have slowed down lately as well but I also leave lesa cups around so that's probably why lol
CatTaps,fdgwhao,t3_elapli,1578410041.0,I can't leave any cups of any sort anywhere in my house. One of my cat seeks them out and will push them great distances in order to knock them down. She is 2 years old and has probably broken at least 8 cups now. She slid one off of my counter last night and luckily it didn't break
AskReddit,fdahgnr,t3_ek7l30,1578246166.0,"Being the owner of 8 cats I can confidently say this would depend on the individual cat. I can guarentee my CH cat named Andi would fill her pockets with ear plugs and anything else made of foam, Iris would fill hers with her Dad's used tissues, a couple of them would have them filled with food, and Johnny would have his filled with strings."
FriendshipAdvice,fcxjnjl,t1_fcockul,1578064572.0,For some reason I did not see that I recieved a reply. Thank you very much. This is basically what I have been thinking as well I just didn't want to be hasty in my decision so I turned to reddit to help me think!
Art,fcwnn7t,t3_ej2p7x,1578030843.0,This is my lock screen now. Amazing!
namenerds,fco2yfs,t3_ehrqbq,1577823084.0,I know someone who named their dogs these exact names and I thought it was ridiculous for dogs. But actual humans are named this. Wow.

StartledCats,fc9fqow,t1_fc9cx9u,1577552013.0,"Better inside my house where they're warm, safe, and fed than outside cold, scared, and starving though."
StartledCats,fc8wbbv,t1_fc8bfeb,1577543077.0,"Maybe Grandma doesn't want to reach to pet the kitty so she uses her feet and it's just what the kitty is used to. Cats are very much creatures of habit. They also just decide on weird quirks sometimes so that could be it too. I have 8 and some of their behaviors are inexplicable.  
Edit: typo"
YouShouldKnow,fc7fa59,t3_egec0q,1577505685.0,Does this work for Canada too? The elderly woman who lived in my house before me gets so much junk mail!
holdmycatnip,fc455ul,t1_fc44kfp,1577406909.0,My best friend has two Bengals and the only way she ever has them outside is on a leash with her. Keeps the kitties and birds of all types safe.
