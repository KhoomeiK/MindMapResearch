RoleReversal,ff7sipb,t3_eqq5gr,1579657300.0,"I think height would just always be a preferential thing. If it's wanting a tall girl solely to satisfy a craving for a fantasy that's when it gets shallow but I, personally, just like tall girls period. I'm sure if any guys want a RR relationship then height simply comes down to preference and there's never going to be a 100% perfect match for everyone. That's why making our mismatches work is so powerful for relationships.

I wouldn't hesitate if a 6'+ girl came up to me and hit on me for being relatively smol 5'8""-5'9"" and slim guy who would carry my lightweight nerd self on her shoulders- anyways, but if someone close to my height or a bit shorter approached me for the same reasons, I would feel just as compelled to spend time with them because the foundation is still there. Not every tall girl is going to want an RR situation either. What matters to most people, or at least from what I've seen, is the affection and acceptance of someone who likes their sensitive selves for who they are when that kind of emotional freedom is still so difficult to find these days. You'll find a great person and some people like shorter lead girls, anyways."
memes,ff7nr5k,t1_ff5szq3,1579653961.0,"They also supposedly rate resources and ability to provide much more importantly than looks or personality, where both genders rate personality pretty equally. Guys also have a growing trend of disregarding looks for those other things as well given that women are becoming more self sufficient and able to provide on average. So if we go by ""women desire attractiveness less"" then we also go by ""women want resources more than looks or personality"" which we all know is too shallow to really buy. 

Men and women aren't so distinguishable anymore. Taste is just taste, people. It's not a part of anyone's ""faction"". She just likes chubby boys."
RoleReversal,ff76vqf,t3_ernye2,1579642295.0,"Admittedly my issue was never conditioning to remain closed off or anything, I'm not starved by (hesitant and regretful) choice. I just never had people to spend time with because of complicated circumstances. Now I'm a socially deprived and awkward boy that wants nothing more than to feel the touch of another person and be a positive force for others but unfortunately I'm rather isolated by my location. I do believe my circumstances were mostly horrible chance mixed with a touch of my own  inabilities to grasp reality for what it is and now I'm trying desperately to break out and get a hug from anyone, really. 

Though I've also kind of adapted, I've become surprisingly cozy alone but the expectations of others and of civilization make it unreasonable to just not do anything and stay by myself. Plus, the human yearning for other people is... Very, very powerful. Many guys/men/boys have the terrible pain of being expected to deny themselves intimacy which is even worse, I just wish I could see another kind human being again."

feminineboys,feogk4q,t1_fem2euk,1579299874.0,"As someone who is on hormones but really just identifies fluid leaning male I can say it's not always as simple as ""Hormones = trans"". I don't consider myself trans, I do have my reasons for being on hormones and while I don't really consider it crossdressing I do use the term as far as needing to explain to people. Often times if people hear I'm taking estro, they'll label me trans even to the point they try to imprint that I'm in denial (see r/egg_irl ) and it used to really fuck me up because it was basically gaslighting. I've gotten more confident about myself because it never felt right to be seen as trans but to this day people just associate the two. Usually because, as I see it, they're upset they or people they know who ARE trans can't get them. My heart always goes out to people who struggle with identity or securing proper care but just like clothes being clothes, my identity doesn't conform to whether I'm taking hormones, imo.

I imagine some people on hormones who call themselves crossdressers definitely struggle with identity as well but I'm just saying; it's a big world out there."
creepyPMs,fenxpmc,t3_epyg53,1579292376.0,"It's all disgusting, all of it, but what always tops it off for me is how obvious it is they've clearly never even had sex before and it makes me worried they genuinely think this kind of thing is how it works. Especially obvious when they think literally just sticking it in and going back and forth a little is enough to make people go crazy and orgasm; I'm legitimately terrified to think that might be why they think rape(which is basically that and is only volatile to people) is hot/is okay/secretly turns others on because they don't even understand that mutual consent and pleasure is a thing. I'm seriously starting to believe that's actually what they think rape is."

niceguys,febszff,t1_febsa5v,1578962313.0,"That's what I thought is that there's some miscommunication. Flirting or back-and-forths with people who know you're not being too serious is fine, especially when you respect when they get uncomfortable. Liking compliments, especially simple ones like ""You look good today"" or ""That shirt makes you look handsome"" in moderation? That's fine. In this context, though, we're talking about guys writing small poems of love to girls they literally just met. Going way overboard for attention, then getting mad when others don't like it."

niceguys,febq7oz,t1_fe6amaf,1578961514.0,"If I knew a girl for 3 days and she said crazy romantic stuff out of nowhere then guess what? It would sound kinda CRAZY. How about that? It turns out you're right, if two people are actually intimate and already in a relationship for long enough and they both are into that it wouldn't sound so bad. Having a nice chat for 2-3 days, however, is not what anyone would call INTIMATE. How are these concepts so hard to get?

Something that sounds amazingly nice in your head is not automatically, objectively categorized as a good thing to say or hear to anyone regardless of anything. You have to THINK before you SPEAK."
niceguys,febmp59,t3_enwwzi,1578960489.0,"Even in Ocarina, adult link was only 17 and Zelda was probably the same. Link knew her for basically a few days, he really only did anything because his tree dad figure told him he had to. In a bunch of the games Zelda either wasn't even there or distantly involved like oracles, Link's awakening, Majora's mask, etc. and Link is still barely an adult in most of them. He even has a childhood crush in Twilight Princess and in BoTW he is literally appointed as a knight and definitely has more than romance on his mind. It was his actual job to do everything he did, one way or another. 

And I know they're different incarnations throughout the games but let's not forget

One word away from some very awkward stuff but they were always adorably brother/sister the way I saw it. There's actually no justification for objectifying what is one of the most classic bonds in game history. Niceness is a helluva drug."

niceguys,febcbsp,t1_fe97ffu,1578957418.0,"Well don't forget women are, by design, structured by nature to exist as inferior in all ways to men and generosity and egalitarian behaviors are in and of themselves an expression of invaluable favor according to nice guys. So women having sex drives? Well that just means the nice guys have to accept that their abilities for relationships, I.e. holding the door open and not calling them horrible names(yet), might actually not be enough to justify being a logical mate simply because they're a male showing basic kindness and thus ""Chad"" has to be the only person more capable than them because the only things other guys must have are big dicks and libidos so all women must want that if the nice guy somehow isn't way above her league already. 

And that just can't be, right? Nah, what makes more sense must be that if a woman wants any basic pleasures or freedoms she must have no survival instincts whatsoever and just doesn't know what's good for her. What I honestly want to know is...

Why do they still care SO MUCH? Why do they apparently NEED female attention so much if they go to such great lengths to make it as unnecessary as possible? I don't know what they keep expecting. All of them."
