For the other 4/5, 2 of them will be able to lose weight but will have trouble keeping it off. All of that is without taking into account personal motivation or other things meaning it's unlikely all of those 5 people will have kept to their regimen. Honestly if you're eating healthier and exercising, that is exactly what people are usually talking about when they say trying to lose weight. But, if you're doing that with the intention of staying the same weight it won't have anywhere near the benefits it could have if it was done with the intention to bring the weight down.

Nowhere in here have I said the health/fitness side of it is a bad idea, just that by ignoring obesity it causes more individual health problems for people than they will be fixing with exercise or health. For some obese people, simply doing too much exercise at their weight will cause irreparable damage. I'm not talking about people who are considered overweight and might stand to lose some pounds, but those who are obese or extremely obese and medically need to for their own sake."

In the same vein, I'd hazard a guess ~80% of people who start going to the gym probably give up and don't end up overly muscly or changing their body that much, that doesn't mean we should all give up fitness - just that it takes more dedication and motivation than most people put in to reach that level."

Reductions in food intake are meant to be re-calculated as you go down in weight to account for that, anyone who just goes to a nutritionist once to get a set level and then keeps at that amount will obviously not keep losing weight. They'll lose a small amount and have to adjust further. Also, yes you will get more hungry, but part of the usual advice for changing diets and exercising more is to ensure you are taking in the right amount of calories of a type/food that satisfies you more until your stomach adjusts to the difference. Once you get used to eating less calories or burning more through exercise on average it becomes easier to adjust further.

I'm not saying it's easy, but you're essentially saying that because they will feel hungry they should keep eating. That in itself will guarantee that no matter what other health benefits they gain, all the initial problems from being obese will still be there."

That simply isn't true, it may be for a small minority of obese people with conditions that keep them that way - but definitely not the majority. 

While it's good to make lifestyle changes to make yourself healthier, the point is that at that weight everything else you do without losing weight will be outweighed by the increased health risks from being that heavy."

worldnews,fdhq04w,t1_fdh0dal,1578427879.0,"The problem is that Australian animals can't adapt to these new threats easily. Most animals here don't know how to defend against a predator like a cat. It's taken 80+ years but some birds have learned how to dissect cane toads and eat just their liver and some other non-poisonous parts - though they still mess up any other animal that tries to eat them.

Obviously camels aren't a threat in the same way, but the areas they live in don't support a huge amount of life to begin with and a large number of them will disrupt the ecosystem. 

It usually isn't the invasive species that have to adapt, it's the Australian ones."

You only have Fox News and some crazier things like Breitbart and also have a way lower voter turnout and gerrymandering to deal with, for you the current solution looks to be in increasing voter turnout to combat that. Our problem is different and will require something longer term, likely breaking up media ownership."

I'll answer you once and simply, no I don't think America needs to remain the protector of anyone - especially after this situation in Iraq shows you will willingly violate their sovereignty. But, if you withdraw from somewhere it needs to be done with warning so you don't leave an area **suddenly** defenseless"

Let's put it another way. If someone earning 250k/year donates 5k to something it would seem like a lot less of a burden on them than someone earning 50k/year donating 5k to something. The differences between the countries are a lot larger than that though."

I mean the centre of the spectrum as in the centre of the range of light that is considered a certain colour. I don't know the correct term to be honest but was talking about the most saturated, vibrant or distinct version of each colour. There are obviously distinct colours that can *usually* be distinguished or it would be a lot harder to even teach them in the first place.

What I've been talking about is designing a palette of colours for use within a design that would be shown somewhere or to distinguish game elements or a template colour palette a company would use for ongoing designs, graphs, etc. It sounded from your initial points that you knew a method to create that sort of range and I'm truly interested in that idea. A real world use, not just a set of pure highlighter style samples that would be sufficient for education."
