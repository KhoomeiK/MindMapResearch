alcohol,ffvibtq,t1_ffvfzy1,1580264790.0,"Also I don't know how to make cocktails, and like I said most parties I go to it isn't an option in the first place. (Cocktails is something I want to learn though)"
relationship_advice,ffvi8ew,t3_evfums,1580264725.0,"You don't have to go to the police unless you think he might cause you harm in the future. I would completely cut him off, especially after how he acted in this encounter. He seems to be very toxic and you shouldn't have to put up with it. Block him on everything and don't speak to him again. If he comes to your house, have your parents get him to leave. Of it becomes a problem and he keeps showing up, THEN go to the police and get a restraining order"
relationship_advice,ffvhmvz,t3_evfv86,1580264323.0,"I mean she did tell you it was related to her depression, I think you need to sit down and have a talk with her and ask her if the attitude you feel like is coming from her is because of that and try to help her with that instead of arguing with her and continue to be on her back about it. It seems like you aren't 100% taking her feelings and her reasons she told you in the past seriously and it might be making things worse"
tattoo,ffvh63u,t3_evfvoj,1580264012.0,Yoooo that is so gorgeous!!! Amazing job!
Advice,ffvgqov,t3_evfvyg,1580263730.0,"I hate to say it but probably places like McDonald's, my very first job entering the work force was a ride operator at an amusement part so maybe if you guys live near an amusement park she can do that? Any fast food service jobs tend to hire those with little to no work experience"
alcohol,ffvg51b,t1_ffvfzy1,1580263330.0,"Cause I want to get drunk lol and I don't like beer (and most parties I go to that's the only option) besides I don't get sick EVERY time even when I do the same things. I've taken 12+ shots before and was fine, but at another party, even doing all the same things, I'd get sick after 5. I just don't understand lol"
alcohol,ffvfqnq,t1_ffvfm1h,1580263066.0,How long should I wait between shots then?
college,ffrpf5j,t1_ffrp0xq,1580162891.0,Thanks bro! I'm definitely gonna try and go over all my notes and stuff from one again
college,ffro7z9,t1_ffrln46,1580162150.0,"Thank you, I'll try my best lol, I don't understand shit from 1,  I understood just enough to pass without taking the class but that's why I'm scared for 2"
college,ffr3zx8,t1_ffqxmvr,1580149963.0,Thank you! I'll definitely give it a try! That's where I struggle cause I've been looking for a pattern but can't figure out what it is

Advice,ffpnc3h,t3_euio6z,1580099412.0,"The simple answer is you have to stop caring abkut how you look. If you can't change it without expensive surgery why focus on it? It literally matters 0% what you look like. It won't make your life better to be pretty, it won't make your life worse if you were uglier. If you have someone that makes you happy, then you don't need looks.

I can't tell you how to stop caring, because that is something you have to teach yourself."
relationship_advice,ffpbpa1,t1_ffpbd65,1580091056.0,Really? I think this is really tame for someone in their early 20s. I know people before who go on trips that last more than a week where they just get fucked up everyday (my friend Synthia did it recently in vegas). This is a pretty normal occurance. Like I said if you are not willing to trust your girlfriend then why continue to date her? Let her live her life and that will show you of you can truly trust her or jot
dating,ffp4vnr,t3_eufb8n,1580086261.0,This is not something you can make a generalization on bro lmao everyone has their own tastes
Advice,ffp4i3k,t3_eufbrf,1580086030.0,"Talk to your friend about how it makes you uncomfortable/mad and you don't like it and if he won't listen then cut him off. Your girlfriend doesn't have to know, it will just make the situation worse"
