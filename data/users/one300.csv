NarcissisticAbuse,fceeg9j,t3_eh23ax,1577619713.0,"I'm not saying this is true for your situation. But my experience has been when I said or done something to hurt his  ego, that is when he would go radio silent and/ or block me as a way of punishing me.

When you feel ready maybe you could look into a grief support group. What helped me was, reading, journaling, walking, and time. There really is no easy answer so to speak.  Try to take care of your self mentally and physically I know easier said then done. I hope you have family and friends around that will make it a little easier. Keep your head up!!"
