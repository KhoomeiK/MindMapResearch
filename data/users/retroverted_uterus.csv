BeautyGuruChatter,ffpbz38,t1_ffoibj1,1580091245.0,Oh god a chef in my husband’s restaurant group just passed away and EVERYONE was suddenly his best friend. I had to mute so many people because I was sick of it.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffpbccw,t1_ffmh8s3,1580090806.0,Cate also smoking through every single pregnancy is pretty sloppy and gross to me.
bestoflegaladvice,ffo1cfg,t1_ffnvkej,1580073128.0,That was a *wild* ride.
TryingForABaby,ffkgmfc,t1_ffi91az,1580022434.0,Yeah sounds like the doctor has blinders on because of her own situation; I wouldn’t trust her to be actually helpful. I’d find a new doctor.
TryingForABaby,ffkgadv,t1_ffk23vd,1580022280.0,He needs to work on ALL of that to improve his sperm quality; the easiest change he can make immediately is to quit smoking.
TryingForABaby,ffkfu04,t3_eu22yi,1580022071.0,"I would take a Tylenol. Ibuprofen is generally not recommended because it’s anti-inflammatory and ovulation is an inflammatory process. That said, as someone else said your health is paramount. Do what you need to and take what you need to take to help yourself.

I get chronic migraines and while TTC I’ve avoided ibuprofen (with the exception of AF week). Ibuprofen never did anything for my migraines anyway though so it wasn’t a huge loss."
Baking,ffkffxu,t3_eu2bqd,1580021888.0,These look fantastic!
bestoflegaladvice,ffka6ua,t1_ffim64f,1580019473.0,"I gathered it’s an entry level job that they were initially offered and are now being given the run-around because they’re demanding pay that matches the top end of their experience and talking down to everyone involved in the process.

It’s going about as well as I’d expect."
bestoflegaladvice,ffk7qdx,t1_ffjcbzn,1580018337.0,">The situation with his crime is... complicated

worldnews,ffilqvp,t1_ffibpmg,1579976903.0,"I briefly worked at a medical primate facility and we had to wear these. Not only is it a whole process to change in and out of them, but you have to shower and change your clothes immediately after changing out of them.  On days I had to wear these suits I slowed my fluid intake because it just wasn’t worth having to take a shower if I needed to pee."
bestoflegaladvice,ffhcd64,t1_ffgl0h8,1579929723.0,"I’m actually worried the roommate is experiencing a mental crisis. Had no reason to give the dog away, their mutual friends mentioned his behavior was off balance and out of character, and now he’s up and gone and no one can get ahold of him. 

I really hope OP gets their dog back, and I really hope the roommate is okay."

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffcew7f,t1_ffc8rar,1579797973.0,"Skipping classes, openly admitting to trying to manipulate her specialist and using those same manipulation tactics *in the same scene* with Tyler when he called her out on being late being her fault, not using the tools she was given or seeing a therapist regularly but impulse buying a horse when she has no experience caring for horses, etc.

No one thought treatment was a bad idea, particularly because she was suicidal when she went. But she has never taken an active role in her own treatment. As someone who has a mental illness, the *only* way you get better is by taking charge of your treatment plan."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffb99my,t3_esn7co,1579755866.0,Well yesterday she was only following 318 accounts and today she’s following 321 so at least 3 people have bought tickets.
