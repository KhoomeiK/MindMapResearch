I didn't agree with a lot of what he said, but I just dislike Cruz soooooo much.


But honestly, I knew made a terrible mistake when I saw a video of Beto (after I had voted, but before he lost) in his kitchen cutting what he said was a *steak*  with a dang serrated bread knife...
I physically cringed at the sight of him shredding this poor excuse for a steak to pieces and saw my fuck-up.

Edit: I tried to censor by typing f*ck, but I'd already said fuck, so that was pointless. You know, like voting for Beto was."

About a month ago, and after losing a lot of weight, I noticed I had 'hip dips'...


They were a new addition on my body and I hated how they looked. I'm sure they were always there, but after 3 kids and entering my 40s, my body composition is different than when I was 20, go figure, lol!


But I was so upset by the way they looked, until I started looking into what it actually was.
Now, I'm cool with them. 
Plus, from the side they're pretty hot (a term I rarely use when talking about myself), although I like the term 'dancer dents', sounds graceful. Ha!"
