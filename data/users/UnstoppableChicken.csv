The reverse ending you and Asra stay in the magic realms and everyone just has to...deal with it. The CG for that ending is actually pretty haunting. But that's Asra's worst version of his Arcana self, the ""reversed Magician"". 

The reverse endings are the worst versions of them, that's why throughout their route you need to make the right choices to bring out the best version of themselves. In Nadia's route Muriel and Asra hook up in the end, and Muriel's route it seems like Asra and Julian will be hooking up although Muriel's route isn't complete. In Julians route Portia and Nadia hook up. In Portia's route fans have theorized Asra and Nadia will hook up? Usually the devs have a pairing in each route."
