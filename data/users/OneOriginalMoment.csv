selfimprovement,fdu2jlg,t3_emxola,1578726379.0,"You visit these sites because you feel good about reading about something that should benefit your future self; in a way, you are claiming to yourself that in doing this I am improving my future self, which is my goal, the driver of my behavior.

One way to get around this is a switch of mindset. You have a goal in mind, and (hopefully) you have a way to quantify it. It is hard to have a switch of mindset without some evidence; set up an experiment to conjecture to yourself that going without these websites is useless to you. For example, something relatively simple would be to take your goal and attempt to make progress on it without visiting a self help website for a period of time, and record the progress. Then, allow yourself to use said sites and record the progress. Use a small enough time delta (day to day, possibly) such that the distributional shift between the adherence of working towards your skill is relatively negligible. If you observe basically no difference, then you have your answer!

Alternatively, just chalk it up to entertainment!"
selfimprovement,fdu1c1b,t3_emw81j,1578725765.0,"\[M 21\] Suppose you have a problem with yourself. Suppose, additionally, that you have found some solutions to said problem, all with different trade-offs. We don't know (to what degree) which solution will fix the problem, but they are probably related so if we find that one solution is awful, the class of similar solutions is likely to also be awful. This trims down the amount of strategies by quite a bit, so we can likely just enumerate through them (given that these are long term goals this is fine).

In my opinion, solutions depend on correctness, adherence and intensity. If a solution succeeds to a degree that's acceptable, I consider that to be a successful strategy to solve your problem; the problem is solved. Obviously this doesn't work for something that has to be maintained, such as fitness. For those kinds of problems (fitness, grades / performance at work, etc) I consider the problem to be consistently unsolved.

If a solution is not correct, we probably aren't solving the right problem. I've noticed this personally with respect to girls; for years I focused on getting good internships, fixing my fitness, improving my social skills, etc to make myself more desirable, ignoring cultivating strong relationships with a lot of girls in my life, either long time friends or people I've just met. Since then I've made it a real effort to talk to a different girl every weekday, with at least 1 new girl every week, even if it's some tinder/bumble date. In this scenario, try a new strategy.

Adherence and intensity are (for me at least) a push-pull relationship. If I'm not adhering to a strategy, I likely need to reduce the intensity. Likewise, if adherence has become very easy, I should push the intensity up. This is not a stationary thing; obviously as I ingrain my strategy more, adherence goes up. This was huge for getting my study habits correct, for instance. I'm also using it to great success for long term adherence to a weight training program (modify accessory amount / progression as a tuning knob for intensity).

All of this isn't useful unless I have some kind of way of tracking it, so I keep a little markdown file for each goal I have, and I fill them in daily. Usually just like

to signify that I've made some progress on that goal. If I notice that I'm having a lot of success, I turn up the intensity unless it's at a level at which I consider to be winning, otherwise I turn it down."

Of course everyone knows what to do, the fact of the matter is is that most people will not do everything the way they want to, for one reason or another; if someone's found a way to improve their adherence and / or intensity with respect to following through with some goal it is useful knowledge

The point of self improvement strategy is to find better reactions to various events in our day to day lives such that our future selves are better off as opposed to doing some suboptimal reaction, where optimality includes latent factors which we don't understand yet such as motivation, discipline, etc

So you can try every strategy under the sun and observe over time your delta of improvement a la plain Monte Carlo, or you can incorporate some bias by adopting a strategy that worked for some person (which is likely more similar to you than you'd think) and learn/adopt the strategy much, *much* faster"
