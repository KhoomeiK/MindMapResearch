Normally when mixing cocaine and opiates the depressant effects of the opiates are counteracted by the stimulant effects of the cocaine. However uppers tend to wear off quicker than downers and as it does your body gradually slows down to a stop as it was only kept alive by the coke.

Sounds like you have a definite problem that almost cost you you're life mate. Might be time to step up the recovery game"

3. Are you telling me you remain in a state of blissful meditation 24/7? Cause if you do, you my friend have exceeded the meditative power of anyone who has come before you.

Counter argument: Alan Watts, a huge advocate and practitioner of meditation and an outwardly very peaceful man, died early because of drug use... so maybe it's not the cure absolutely everything people think.

I have a psychologist I see, I'm seeing a psychiatrist at the end of the month for meds. I may only be going through the motions but I think I'm going through the right motions. You're right in substance use being the only thing that keeps me going though. It's one of 2 things I've found that seems to not be directly painful in a negative way (gym being the other). I keep it as hidden as possible though, same as many others, because people who don't understand, simply don't understand...
I'm hoping the psychiatrist prescribes something that does the same sorta job as booze but healthier until I find the thing that makes it all seem worthwhile.

addiction,fegar24,t1_feg9yb9,1579085293.0,"Well as far as generic addiction advice goes. 
Addictions are usually born from pain, you might find you're using gambling as a distracted way to pass the time while dealing with something painful, loneliness, family, depression, anxiety etc. Typically you'd then get some form of support group going to help you properly identify and fix the problem. The easy part is stopping using whatever your chosen problem behavior is, the hard part is removing the pain source so you don't start again. 
If you think this is a problem, take it seriously. As a catastrophized version of what could happen, your CSgo skins gambling could turn into real gambling, now you're loosing money hand over fist, flooded with guilt trying desperately to make up for lost money, stealing from people, lying, sneaking around, double life stuff. 
Your thing may not be an issue as these things aren't issues until they cause their first problem. If it isn't and you think you have a grasp on it, go for it, it's a cool way to spend 30 min and $10 every now and then. If you think it could become an issue, bite it while it's a small problem.

Kava at this point isn't very heavily studied so the presence of withdrawals may actually be there for some (same as marijuana) but people ignore it in favor of pushing their preferred drug (same as marijuana). So there may very well be some people out there, experiencing withdrawal symptoms and using again to cover up the symptoms and believing they're not because ""Kava is not addictive""."
Kava,fdms0l6,t1_fdmpz8q,1578562903.0,"All I'm saying is the potential is there and maybe shouldn't be treated as lightly as some do. It may not have many physical side effects (baring a handful of catastrophic liver damage cases) but that's the same as weed. The way weed ruins peoples lives is through behavioral changes, neglecting things to get high, decreased motivation, negative dietary changes from increased appetite etc. 

Saying people drink Kava their entire adult lives is a but of a misnomer as well cause people drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes their entire adult lives.

And yes those negative side effects clear up with cessation of use but so do the negative consequences of opiates, benzos, alcohol, nicotine etc. That doesn't mean it's easy for everyone to give up. There may very well be people out there for who Kava just fixes everything and they're one of the very unlucky few who it damages the liver and they die or it makes them lethargic and lazy so they begin to neglect things that need doing or that they once loved to do in favour of the calm of Kava.

Also, food is addictive and has no withdrawls, same as gambling and sex."
Kava,fdmhx0k,t3_em2wva,1578550504.0,"""Kava is not addictive""... Kava provides little to no withdrawal symptoms when use stops abruptly. Anything can be addictive dude. Just like any other substance, kava is a drug and all drugs can be abused. It wouldn't even have to be a drug to be addictive as almost anything can be. 

Gabor Mate's definition of addiction is ""use of any substance or behaviour that provides short term relief or pleasure and causes long term harm and the individual finds difficult to stop""

ADD/ADHD well, duh. Maybe not useful for schizophrenia tho. 
Sure it has a different effect on ADD/ADHD but anxiety shares a lot of similar symptoms of ADHD, depression can look a lot like ADD and ritalin works for all of it pretty much. 
Ritalin also doesn't provide much euphoria in anyone, that's not what it's known for. It's know for it's ability to provide laser focus and drive to do things. 
Amphetamines are euphoric ones.
My mind is scatterbrained often but is that ADHD or anxiety? I frequently forget things and can't focus but is that ADD or depression? 
I'm no doctor or psychiatrist and there are no facts, only interpretations. But in my interpretation, something like ritalin works for a lot of things and not only ADD/ADHD and I get similar effects from benzos, only instead of excess energy my body is relaxed but similar mental effects. I think that's similar with a lot of people."

I think I'll probably be fine with weekend use :D"

Is Friday night and either Saturday or Sunday over doing it? I've heard of the rash you get from heavy use and some very unclear info on damage to liver. That being said I try to treat my liver well; choline, milk thistle, coffee etc."

alcoholism,fczk3jc,t1_fcxzcqw,1578102970.0,"That's alright 🙂 I think the only thing I'd add is that the person in question does actually care about all of these things, if he didn't he wouldn't drink. But unfortunately life can be so unforgiving and awful at times that even Jesus himself questioned the validity of his own faith when unfairly nailed to a cross. That's not to drag religion into the mix, maybe it does have it's place and maybe it doesn't, but it serves as a great reference point in your own thinking. 
Sometimes, life is awful... Even for the archetypal perfect man (Jesus) it can be unbearably awful. Can you really expect more from an ordinary man? Life is hard, the person in your life who abuses alcohol does it because it's unbearable at that moment and he knows of no other outlet, or at least doesn't trust any others to work and not hurt him further. Now what they're doing is undoubtedly tragic and harmful, but they aren't doing it for light reasons."

alcoholism,fcx46j6,t3_ejd66n,1578050460.0,"Welcome to the standard effects of drinking... it does not get better.
An achey liver is common, alcohol attacks the liver, mines ached for months at a time constantly. 
Stomach pains, That's common as well, alcohol is a solvent and starts dissolving the mucosa lining and protecting your stomach so it'll be left a little bare and acidy.
As for the worry you're having about it all, that's rebound anxiety, your brain quickly gets used to having an excess of GABA (the thing alcohol makes your brain produce and makes you calm) after it's got used to this it's left a little over excited and not calm without the alcohol. 

Tips for harm reduction; stick to low percentage stuff, 4.5% beer or cider. It's less harsh on your body than spirits. 
Find a nice level and hold it, don't set out to get shit faced, shit faced ain't that fun and the little fun you do have is forgotten about come morning.
Eat! Eat before hand, helps make it easier on your stomach.
Drink water, and lots. Lessens the acheiness the next day.
Take a B vitamin complex supplement the next day, won't help with symptoms but will help with not getting alcoholic dementia later ya know. 

All of this should clear up by itself in a few days if you slow down or stop drinkng, it will get worse if you continue.

When to go see a doctor? Eh whenever, bug your GP as much as you want. 
When to visit a hospital? Puking, peeing or crapping blood, yeah that's ER time. 
Abdominal pain so bad you can hardly stand, yep, ER time.
Uncontrolably shaking and seeing/hearing things that aren't there, ER time.
Yellow eyes and skin, ER time.

Me personally, I'm a fan of simply drinking cider again till I don't care haha."
alcoholism,fcx3pnj,t3_ejdubb,1578049876.0,"Negatives: Sore stomachs, constant heart burn, intense anxiety when not drunk, aching liver, coughing fits, hypochondria, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, the worst headaches you've ever had, depression, chance of sudden death, neuropathy, pancreatitis, high blood pressure, psychosis, memory loss, dementia etc.

Positives: you don't care about anything including the negatives cause you're drunk all the time.

Alcohol does this unique thing in the world of drugs where it gives you the ""fuck its"" for about 10-20min after each drink. Doesn't make you stupid, doesn't make you unaware, it just sledgehammers your brain into not caring about the consequences of anything happening at the moment. Stress at work? boom now I don't care if I loose my job. Relationship issues? boom now I don't care if the person is hurt or leaves. Addiction ruining my life? Boom now I don't care if my life is ruined. Serious health issues? Boom I don't care if I'm dead.
Oh no, now I'm sober! Oh holy shit, what the fuck is all of this! What have I done! I'm so fucking stupid! I'm gonna loose everything! Everyone hates me! I'm dying! I'm a useless piece of shit that deserves nothi *drinks* aaahhhhh, that's better, who gives a fuck... 

Wonder why he drinks? Imagine yourself in a position where everything is falling down around you, you feel as though you can't call for help, everything is your responsibility and fault, you can't remember your last good day, up until right now almost every waking moment of your life has sucked... now put something next to you that just, makes you not care with 100% success and consistency."

So I'll go with no, you can't recover without hitting rock bottom cause you need a bottom to know when you're not there. Rock bottom is simply your lowest point. For some people rock bottom is spending $150 a week on booze a couple weeks in a row, for others it's snorting cocaine off a blood soaked table in a crack house with the owner of the coke passed out barely breathing next to you. It's all subjective."

Jeff Nippard, Athlean X, Omar Isuf are all good channels for learning and with Omar Isuf and Athlean X, being realistic about what's to come. Honestly, your starting stats don't matter, your starting program, doesn't matter. All that matters is you have a ""why"" to drive you through the tough days and that you keep going! Good luck bro."
