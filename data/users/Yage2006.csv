Just power it up alone if you can or at least make sure nothing else in your chain is trying to sync the clock, or set it to internal. Also be sure you don't have a DAW or something running on your PC cause that too could interfere. 

They are aware of this issue, will probably be fixed soon. Easy to work around though, just run it and the midi control center alone with no other midi apps or devices trying to sync up the microfreak.

Hopefully this works for you."

Real Debrid Has absolutely nothing to do with that though. That will depend on the links you are passing through their service, they don't supply those links, they just get the files off the links YOU and or whatever addon or method provide. So if you give it a link that is labeled as atmos, then that is what you will get. Same for any codec. If you were to even bring up Kodi  to their tech support, they would probably ban you. 

Since you wanna go that route though, the 8gb of storage is an issue, A kodi install can easily got up to 1.5gb or more depending, and ya you can empty the cache and all that to free up space again but it's something you're gonna have to keep an eye on and that's pretty annoying.
