Maintenant, c’est comme tu dis: on a réduit le maximum à plusieurs endroit, et le monde en général conduit à peu près 5 km/h sous la limite.

Mais c’est pas juste ça. Le nombre de véhicules sur la route de nos jours est un facteur important qui fait que les vitesses tombent. Il n’y a pas vraiment d’heures de pointe. C’est la congestion presque 12 heures par jour, et c’est souvent pire le week-end. Il n’y a pas de routes alternatives sur l’île. Si on part de l’est pour aller au centre-ville, c’est la 40 et Decarie ou bien Notre-Dame. S’il y a un embouteillage sur un, ça déborde évidemment sur l’autre. Même histoire avec les ponts, dans n’importe quelle direction.

Moi je n’ai pas de solution, je ne me pense pas plus intelligent que les autres. Mais, je suis un peu enragé au volant. Je pense que c’est impossible ne pas l’être un peu. Avec tellement de véhicules sur la route, et avec le manque d’espace, c’est sur et certain qu’il y aura toujours des idiots de près, que ce soit le monde qui roule à 50 sur la voie de gauche de la 40, ou le monde qui fait le slalom sur les voies pour dépasser les autres en plein embouteillage."

What you’re describing is a huge problem. On Reddit, it’s such a small and not at all representative segment of our society in general. People still want the convenience of their own car, along with ample, easy and cheap parking at their destination. It’s been like this for decades, pushing public transport can only do so much, and then again only for people in the city.

Also, it’s very easy to blame landlords, and a lot of them are indeed shitty. But when the city raises your evaluation, raising taxes by the same stroke, yeah landlords have to raise their rent.

In other words, _everyone_ needs to get their act together: City, landlords and business owners. Some form of cooperation is essential for all three levels to thrive. It’s unfair to single out to be over the others for failure. Here, we only hear about the tenants’ side, and they rightly have lots to complain about.
