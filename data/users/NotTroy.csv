todayilearned,ff28lep,t1_ff26x5l,1579496977.0,"It's not about slavery. Slavery is the red herring. The strawman that people who argue against reparations construct so that they can attack it, and ignore the real issue. 

The real issue is the century (and longer) of institutionalized racism that followed the end of slavery. Things like redlining, Jim Crow laws, voter suppression, and the denial of hard earned GI benefits mentioned in OPs post. These policies weren't incidental, they were built in to the systems we created and enforced. We passed laws and regulations designed to insure that people with darker skin colors remained second class citizens. The single greatest wealth building tool that existed in this country for the last century was home ownership. You get a bank to loan you some money, you buy a house, and you spend 30 years paying it off. Over that 30 years, your investment in the home greatly increases in value, and so your overall wealth increases, and you get to leave it to your children, who benefit from it and are able to (hopefully) climb the economic ladder and do better than you did.

Black people were by and large denied this opportunity for much of the 20th century. This isn't a 19th century problem. Black neighborhoods became off limits for loan officers. Entire neighborhoods were left to be ravaged by time with no chance for an equity loan to get repairs. The wealth and prosperity of people of color withered on the vine while white people enjoyed the greatest economic boon in recorded history. THIS is what reparations is about. Making up (as best we can) for this obscene history.

The other strawman that opponents like to set up is something else you mentioned: Money. Fearmongers will tell people that they want to take your money away and write big checks for all the black people. There are two problems with this. First of all, it's a stupid plan that would never be implemented. Second of all, that's not at all what people are calling for. Reparations don't need to take the form of the government writing a big check to distribute to people with brown skin. 

There are MANY mechanisms and economic levers that can be pulled to help enrich the lives of black people. Laws and regulations that can help ease the ability of people of color to get loans for things like home ownership and repair. Programs to help low income households, especially those in inner cities, to afford child care. Reduced interest rates or extended repayment plans for student loans, to help lower income families be better able to afford to send their children to university. Yes, all of these things cost money, but a common refrain among conservatives, especially the kind of people who voted for Trump because of his business acument, is that it takes money to make money. You must invest wisely to see big returns. Investing in people is much the same. If you spend some money on the front end to insure that more children grow up in stable households with parents who can reliably work and make a good income, and who then go to better schools, and have an easier time affording a good higher education, then you ultimately end up with a much more productive citizenry, which more than makes up for the initial investment.

Fast forward to now. I've been educated, had a political awakening, learned about the history of redlining and other institutionalized racism, and I now fully support the concept of reparations. Something needs to be done to help make up for 10 generations of African Americans who were oppressed and kept from developing the same kinds of wealth and opportunities afford to white America.

The reason you can't get stealth in this situation is that once a monster is aware of ANY threat, it can no longer be surprised. If your rogue rolls a 32 stealth check, and manages to sneak all the way up behind the Orc, and then your Paladin comes lumbering in with a 7 stealth, then it doesn't matter what the Rogue did because the Paladin made the orcs aware of a threat and the Rogue cannot not inflict the surprised condition on the Orcs."

Look, if it works for you, great. But it's very common advice when it comes to Assassins for players to go in with the expectation that the surprise condition critical hit feature is something that won't see a whole lot of use throughout a campaign."
3d6,feg3zz8,t1_fef11ff,1579075898.0,"You don't need to start at 12 CON. You're doing Variant Human, I assume, for MI: Druid feat and Shillelagh? You can do 08 14 14 09 16 13, which leaves you at the exact same CON modifier (+2) and frees up a feat or ASI, but this time with Constitution saving throw proficiency and the various mentioned bonuses. That's academic, however, because you're doing Arcana Cleric in order to pick up Booming Blade, meaning you don't need the Sorcerer dip anyway. It would still be a better option than the Druid dip, however, as it would at least save you from needing Resilient: Constitution.

Where the Sorcerer dip really helps out is in the alternative to the Arcana Cleric gish: the Nature Cleric gish. Nature Clerics get Shillelagh, but they need to somehow pick up Booming Blade / Green-Flame Blade. They can do so normally by going Variant Human for MI: Wizard, or going High Elf.

However, because of the differences between Nature Cleric and Arcana Cleric, the Nature Cleric build has an incentive to go Dwarf instead. A Hill Dwarf gets Constitution and Wisdom stat boosts, +1 HP per level, and because they're dwarfs they can ignore the strength requirement of heavy armor. Nature Clerics get Heavy Armor proficiency. This means that if you can do the build using Hill Dwarf, you can ignore Strength and Dexterity while focusing entirely on Wisdom and Constitution, and getting the equivalent of a Fighter / Paladin / Ranger hit die. This is where the Sorcerer dip comes in. It becomes the best way to gain access to the needed cantrips, because otherwise you'd have to wait until level 4 to pick up MI: Wizard.

Your stats can look like this: 10 12 16 08 16 13. You take War Caster at level 4, bump Wisdom at 8 and 12, and then max out Constitution at the high levels (or take Tough if you prefer). This build has its own pros and cons over the Arcana Cleric build. It loses out on Arcane Mastery and 100% Divine Intervention, but it gains an ASI / Feat, Heavy Armor, more HP, the Shield spell (Sorcerer level 1 choice), and Favored By the Gods (by going Divine Soul Sorcerer). You also get the Nature Domain's really nice Dampen Elements feature (a more defensive variation of Absorb Elements that doesn't use a spell slot and can be used to protect other people). Finally, because you have a level of Sorcerer, you gain the ability to attune to a whole host of magic items that would otherwise be off limits to you. If you're going to use a Quarterstaff, why not aim for a Staff of Power, to gain a butt load of extra spells and +2 to attack rolls, damage, armor, saving throws, and spell attack rolls?

This is just an alternative build that gets you the same basic result, but with different trade offs. For my money, I prefer this option to the ultra popular Variant Human Arcana Cleric build, but that's because I like how it emphasizes the more tanky, in your face play style and the options it opens up."
3d6,feg2ix5,t1_fef6c60,1579074099.0,"Yeah, if you're playing a solo game. Surprise depends on the entire group. If a creature spots even one person it considers a threat, then it can't be surprised.

3d6,feevauw,t1_fedh98n,1579041982.0,Weapon damage differences are so small as to be essentially meaningless.

There is a better option. Take Pole Arm Master, wield a glaive or halberd, and take 2 levels of Barbarian (maybe 3 to grab a subclass) to get Reckless Attack. A crit fishing build isn't about number of ATTACKS, its about number of SWINGS, and Reckless Attack giving you on demand advantage combined with Pole Arm Master will give you a total of 6 swings per turn, with a possible 7th swing later in the round if a creature approaches you and activates the Pole Arm Master reaction attack.

However, Dexterity is the most reliable to target of the ""big 3"" saving throws, and is typically one of the primary avenues of dealing with large size and above enemies (big things typically have poor dexterity). One thing to consider, however, is that Bane requires you to get up close and personal with whatever you're debuffing. You need to be within 30 feet of the target or targets. If that isn't something you're worried about, then yeah, Bane is an awesome debuff to pick up, especially against mooks and minions. Keep in mind that most of your ""boss"" type creatures, especially at mid to high CRs, will have good Charisma saves. Things like undead, demons, devils, celestials, and other extra-planar entities all have good to great Charisma.

Sure, maybe they're a closet serial killer. OR, maybe the group Paladin once shoplifted as a kid and has never spoken about it to anyone. Maybe the flirtatious bard is actually a virgin, or the studious wizard's seemingly academic book selection is actually mostly bodice ripper romance novels, which he can't get enough of. Don't worry about it having to be something tremendously consequential to the story or even to the character's background.

dndnext,fe2m8jq,t3_enfgl0,1578840427.0,"How are your stats looking? Did you roll or use standard array or point buy? As a Bladesinger, your AC is probably just fine. Combined with spells like Shield and Mirror Image, and you're not going to get hit often. Your main concern when it comes to survivability then becomes HP. If you've maxed out your Intellect, then it's time to start looking at solutions like taking the Tough feat and maxing out your Constitution. The final piece of the puzzle is mobility. Wizards are already very good at that. Misty Step is a big life saver. On top of that, you might consider taking a Feat like Mobile. Mobile + Bladesinging should give you 50 feet of movement, and the ability to get out of dangerous situations by simply taking swings at enemies close to you.

Finally, consider taking a multiclass dip in Rogue. Picking up 2 levels of Rogue gives you expertise in two skills, a bit of sneak attack damage, and the ability to use your bonus action to further increase your mobility through disengage or dash bonus actions. Or you could choose to take a couple of Fighter levels, which would give you a small HP boost, a bonus action heal (though a small one), Action Surge, and a fighting style choice that could be used on Dueling for more melee damage, or Defense to put you at 18 AC in non-magic studded leather armor.

As far as spicing up combat, start seeing combat as less about being a damage dealer, and more about the various ways that your magic can completely screw up an enemy force's battlefield positioning, tactics, or strategy. If there are 6 enemies all bunched up and you can get away with it, by all means toss that fireball if that's what you want to do, but there are so many Wizard spells that you can use to creatively screw over enemies or give big advantages to allies. Those moments can be more fun and have more of an impact on a battle than a big damage spell or running up and swinging a couple of times ever could."

DMAcademy,fdqcccy,t3_emo2lf,1578662822.0,"I've got an idea that I may try out that is similar to this. I want to run a version of Tyranny of Dragons that replaces the Red Wizards with a faction led by Arkhan the Cruel, with a plot inspired by his appearance in Descent to Avernus. His attempts at using the Hand of Vecna to free Tiamat have failed, so he's recruiting the Cult of the Dragon on Fearun, and seeking out the Eye of Vecna and the Book of Vile Darkness to further augment his power. 

I don't really want to have the players straight up fight Arkhan and his lackey's right away, and I don't want to do the thing where they try to stop his dastardly plan at every turn, but I still want the players to get a sense of his progress. So my idea was to have a character experience a vision or dream, during which Arkhan acquires the Eye of Vecna. Instead of just a narration, I'd run it as an entire session, during which the players would each get a character sheet to run based off o Arkhan and his minions (Krull, Torogar, and probably a 3rd that I haven't made up yet), but without names attached. They'd actually play through the scenario where he acquires the Eye, at the end of which there would be a reveal of who this group actually is.

DMAcademy,fdgvfdr,t3_elci6d,1578409301.0,"Did you have a session 0 with your players? If you did, was it brought up that you'd be running them through a module? Players who know that they're playing through a module should have an understanding that the DM is guiding them through an over arching plot, and there may be times when the players have to support the DM in that by playing along, and making decisions that help further the narrative. 5th Edition is a cooperative game, and that means cooperation between the PCs, but also between the PCs and the DM. One thing that's discussed a lot on forums like this are the issues that crop up when a game has an antagonistic DM, but you'll rarely see discussion about antagonistic players. 

Usually in modules, the starting chapter or two can be fairly linear. It takes time to establish characters, setting, and plot details, and those things are all laid out in the beginning (because they have to be, duh). After that, things usually tend to open up a bit, and while that doesn't mean that all rails disappear, it does usually mean that players can choose which rails they prefer to be on at any given time.

dndnext,fddkw3f,t3_ekc471,1578316193.0,"First of all, unless you're dead set on dual wielding, then I'd recommend you drop that feat and go with something else. EK's are really setup to be tremendous sword and board users. Dual wielding in 5e is just plain inferior to the other major fighting styles. 

The most effective method of playing an EK is to make use of Booming Blade and/or Green-Flame Blade until level 11, when you get your third attack. Unfortunately, going this route means that your off-hand weapon becomes useless until level 11. You can only make the bonus action attack with your offhand weapon when you use the attack action, but for Booming Blade and Green-flame Blade you're actually casting a spell (an attack roll is involved, but action-wise its a spell, not an attack action) which means you'll be unable to use the off-hand attack. Also, if you do go with the Bladesinger dip, remember that activating the Bladesong requires a bonus action, which is yet another thing that gets in the way of effectively using dual wielding.

By going with 1h+Shield, you are able to use Booming Blade/Green-flame Blade effectively, while having a higher armor class, using a better fighting style (Dueling gives more overall damage at higher levels) and opening up a feat to spend on something else besides Dual Wielder. Basically, sword+board gives you better overall damage and better overall defense.

I'd recommend going with War Caster for your level 4 feat. Might as well get it out of the way. At level 6, pick up something like Sentinel. Sentinel is an awesome feat because 1. you're so defensive, and 2. at level 7 you're going to get a huge buff to your overall damage, and you want to have any many chances as possible to apply that damage. Sentinel lets you often get an additional attack every round.

I also agree with some of the other posters. Skip the Wizard levels until at least after level 11. The reason why is that level 7 is a HUGE level for EKs, and the benefits from it will carry you on to level 11, when you'll get your 3rd attack, which is kind of the climax of the Fighter kit. At level 7 you get access to War Magic for the ability to use a cantrip attack like Booming Blade followed by a bonus action attack with your weapon. This is just plain better than any other option, and really lets you put out some good damage. 

On top of that, and probably most importantly, you get access to 2nd level spells. Specifically, level 7 opens up the ability for you to swap out your level 3 ""any school"" spell for Shadow Blade. Shadow Blade was quite literally MADE for EKs. No other class benefits as much from the spell, because no other class can apply it's effects as much as fighters with their multitude of attacks. At level 7, with Booming Blade and Shadow Blade, you can be doing 5d8+10 damage per turn. You could do even more than that with Green-flame Blade, assuming there are two enemies next to each other for it to jump to. Additionally, Shadow Blade makes you more accurate. A good chunk of your adventuring will be spent in dim light or darkness, and during those times having Shadow Blade will confer advantage to all of your attacks.

Honestly, I wouldn't even go Wizard at all, if I were you. You're incredibly lucky to have those stats. Combined with being a fighter, it means there no reason you can't max out Con and Int if you so desire. You have no shortage of awesome feats to choose between if you don't feel like maxing stats. Because of that, any 2 levels of Wizard you take comes with a significant opportunity cost. If you really must a Wizard dip, then Bladesinger or War Mage are where it's at. Bladesinger is more defensive, but War Magic gives you that high bonus to Initiative, which is great, plus a very useful version of the Shield spell that also helps on saving throws."
