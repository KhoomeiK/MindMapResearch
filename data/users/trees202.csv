Terrible ppl."
aww,fephomk,t1_feowgmt,1579320764.0,"Never seen Dr Phil before until yesterday. They were talking about a girls Christian reformed school that was ""oh so abusive"". Sounded like every fundamental religious family I've ever met. (a lot). Miserable place to be, but nothing to write home about. ""oh no! They wouldn't let me listen to the radio and They forced me to eat gross salad and if I didn't finish it, that's what I got for my next meal!!!"" 

I was not impressed. You really have THAT little material?? 

Anyway... The sick baby made me give Dr Phil a chance. He failed. 

Gimme my Sally Jesse raphel and Jenny Jones!"
aww,fefo06j,t1_fef04bc,1579060536.0,"Check out adoption subreddit. They're a bit militant, but it was pretty eye opening for me.

Also, adoption helps ppl, yes, but there is no shortage of parents looking for kids. And in some cases, it hurts ppl too. If there were less ppl looking for kids, the entire ""industry"" would be more ethical. There is no where NEAR a shortage of wonderful suitable adoptive parents for healthy babies. You don't go looking to adopt a baby to ""help"".

You want to ""help"", you adopt an older kid or a kid with medical problems."
aww,feeaiz9,t1_fee81qa,1579029772.0,"Why do you want to adopt if you can have bio kids? 
There are no healthy babies ""in need of a home"". 
Unless you're looking to adopt an older child or a special needs child, you're not really ""helping"" anyone, just contributing to supply and demand of babies. 

I'd love to adopt too, but there are like 30 couples looking to adopt for every healthy infant, and the more demand, the more pressure that gets put on supply and the more sketchy shit will go on, all sorts of questionable things, starting with, but certainly not limited to, pressuring moms to give up their babies instead of helping them figure out how to keep them and supporting them.

Annnnnnd you're taking a baby away from a couple that can never have kids without adoption. A lot of these ppl wait years and years and never get matched, even if they would be amazing parents."
aww,feea41g,t1_fee00eq,1579029530.0,"The fact that they're in a hospital in the pic, and it's not a newborn, means this baby probably wasn't one of those supply and demand kiddos. 

I wish them well!"
AskReddit,fdj3tnf,t1_fdix0es,1578457706.0,"Yep. My dad came home throwing a fit bc the union wanted to ""make"" him get one. They were charging the guys that didn't get one more. 

Good business practice if you ask me!"
pics,fdgubs6,t1_fdgtjtu,1578408520.0,"Been on a train that hit someone. It was a lot more fucked up than ""thud"". I imagine a bus would be worse--especially for the driver. Train drivers can possibly move past it by logically knowing they was NOTHING they could have done. A bus driver might not have that ""luxury"".

Just bc someone hurts more doesn't mean other ppl don't hurt. 

My favorite conductor quit his job after helping the police look for body parts, coming back on the train and puking and having to call his wife to come get him. 

I'm sure the police/firemen weren't feeling too giddy that day either."

WomensHealth,fda5pjs,t3_ek9f2m,1578242052.0,"Was on it for like 10 years. Didn't get pregnant until I stopped taking it and intentionally got pregnant. 
I had monogamous relationships, so after we both got tested for STDs we didn't use condoms or pull out. Most stories of the pill failing are ppl taking it wrong. Set a timer on your phone to take it at the same time every day."
Adoption,fd2os1u,t1_fcat5rc,1578150232.0,"Obviously I'm not ""in their heads"" but my FIL and AIL were both adopted as infants and seem ""fine with it"". Both are happy successful adults. FIL found his bios for medical history and visits every other year when they happen to be on vacation in that neck of the woods anyway. 

My coworker was adopted around 4 and is super open about talking about it. She describes her relationship with her adoptive parents the way any bio kid would. She does talk about some trauma, but is super happy to have been adopted. 

My best friend in college was adopted. He loves his AP. He and his wife are choosing not to have children and they are always ""hanging out"" with his AP as part of the immediate family / best friends. (his sister was adopted a little older and does have a multitude of issues though and only started coming back around the family when she needed help with her... Very many... children.)

Obviously all ancedotal, but these are my personal experiences with adoption."
Adoption,fd2km5v,t3_ejraso,1578148570.0,"Chemthrowaway definitely had the ""correct"" response about continuing to supply and demand and unethical stuff. That was a really good response. 

I'm going to offer a less popular opinion, that's probably going to get me down voted bc it's not ""about the kids"", it's about the adoptive parents, who are often demonized on this sub....

I'm a mother of 2 biological kids, my husband and I always wanted 3 but due to some health issues it isn't advised. We've considered adopting a baby.... My husbands aunt and father were adopted as infants and it worked out great, everyone is happy. It seemed logical to us, But since then, we've come to know a handful of WONDERFUL couples who can't have children. They want nothing more than to be parents... And they've been waiting...a long long time. It might never happen for them. Is devastating. 

Now, I know babies are not a ""commodity"", but the thought of taking away the only opportunity that a wonderful woman has to be a mother, when I was capable of having my own, is not something I want to do now that I personally know some of these women. 

**I'm interested in adopting an older sibling group now once my bios are teenagers... Just gotta get my husband on board!"

AskReddit,fcv0igd,t3_eixc75,1577992165.0,"Did it a lot back in 2005-2010 when I was like 19-24. It was a shit show of terrible first dates. Seriously, I probably went on 20+ of them. Eventually I started insisting we meet right away bc it really sucked to fall for someone after chatting for weeks, only to find out how hard they sucked IRL. I dated one of the guys for like 2 months, but I think it was more bc I finally fired my long time FWB and was pretty desperate for a relationship. 

it made for some pretty interesting/hilarious experiences and stories though! 

Honestly, I'm just glad I never got murdered. 
I used to always try to bring them to my ""home bar"" bc the bartenders, owners, and regulars knew me and would look out for my dumb ass. 

I feel like it's way less risky and more normal nowadays. Back then it was just a lotta weirdos.... Or maybe that's just what I was reeling in..."

While I'm perfectly fine with used things and will GLADLY accept hand-me-downs from friends and family, i hesitate to get anything for my infant or toddler that I don't know the history of. It's less of a big deal when they're older and don't put everything in their mouths."

Most fucking horrifying thing.

No more bacon for my kiddo! 

It's been over a month and I still feel my heart racing with anxiety every time he's eating.

Grandma and Grandpa just watched in horror, luckily I had taken a refresher course semi-recently when I was pregnant with his little sister."
