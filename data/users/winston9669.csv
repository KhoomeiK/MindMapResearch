musictheory,ff53q0i,t3_erp1x3,1579579386.0,"Across the years, composers adopted different keys for different affective purposes, which were usually tied to the capabilities of instruments and their timbral qualities. If someone wrote in D major, for instance, brass sounded great and particularly bright in that key during a certain period of music history, so D major became associated with fanfares and the like. Similarly, F minor was reserved at a certain point for earthly, grave, or infernal associations due to the flats. 

Then you get into the mid-late 19th century where certain keys had different associations for individuals: Strauss and Vaughan Williams both used E major to suggest the heavenly or the elevated, and Mahler had his own set of associative tonalities as well. Then you had issues of synesthesia with Messiaen and things like that. 

If you're talking about solo repertoire, some keys just sit better on certain instruments due to their construction. All that to say, there's a bunch of explanations, both expressive and technical."

askmusicians,fdmcqgd,t1_fdlwjwu,1578545740.0,"There's nothing stopping you from resolving that Db^(7) to a C harmony by semitone, but that sort of smooth voice leading (not quite ""parsimonious,"" since that typically applies to harmonies with roots related by third) isn't exactly typical before the late nineteenth century. That Db^(7) would normally resolve to a Gb sonority, since we usually think of seventh chords like that as built on the V, which goes to I in much of Western art music. 

Whew. But if that Db^(7) were to go to a C as you said, then the F, you would most likely label it as an aug6, just a bit of labelling convention. Does that help?"
askmusicians,fdmcbpx,t1_fdlwjwu,1578545400.0,"Yes, the German Aug6 chords sound exactly the same as a dominant seventh, since the harmonies' aug6/min7 are enharmonic equivalents. The Italian and French varieties sound a touch different, though they all serve predominant functions. 

Composers like Schumann and Schubert took advantage of the fact that the Ger^(6) and dominant sevenths sounds identical to effect surprise modulations to keys with roots a semitone apart. Clever stuff!"
askmusicians,fdliwg6,t3_efy7fu,1578525011.0,"From someone who's taught theory and keyboard to elementary schoolers and university students alike, here's what I found helps my beginner students:

First, it's not fun for everyone, but learning some elementary theory is really going to help you understand why things sound the way they do, why some things sound ""good"" and others sound not so amazing, and why music is structured the way it is.  You can go to any theory textbook for that (Burstein/Strauss, Clendenning/Marvin, Benward/Saker, etc.). Learning to read is also a great idea, I'd say it's mandatory but I get called stodgy a lot, so make of it what you will--it depends on your eventual goals. 

The canonical technique books range from the useful (but kind of dry) Czerny and Hanon to the more difficult, (but more interesting, in my opinion) Dohnányi book. Bartok's Mikrokosmos is also good to work though, but expect some new sounds you don't hear everyday. 

Always, always work with a metronome. 

For beginner rep in the Western art tradition like you mention, some people find the Bach preludes helpful in the early stages, and some of the Mendelssohn piano rep is pretty accessible as well. I'm not giving names, because I don't know your full situation and where you stand right now, but I'm sure you'll find something. The Notebook for Anna Magdalena might be an option as well (Bach).

Regarding technique, know all your scales--major and the three varieties of minor--and the fingerings to go with them. That's where those boring technique books come in handy.

That said, plan out a little to do every day and knock it out. The professional musicians playing on the big stages (trust me, I was one) feel lost and incapable from time to time, too. Good luck!"
