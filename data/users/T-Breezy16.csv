[John Walton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Walton?wprov=sfla1), the Walmart founder's son, was a Special Forces combat medic.  
  
He dropped out of university in order to enlist in the Army and fight in Vietnam after the Tet Offensive in 1968. After qualifying as a Green Beret, he joined the Surveillance and Observation Group (SOG), who ran insanely dangerous recon missions in Laos, Cambodia, and North Vietnam. Their shit was so secret he wasn't allowed to talk about it until it was declassified 20 years later. SOG casualty rates were like 130%, and he won a Silver Star for bravery in combat.  
  
I know it's a common trope that the rich tend to dodge this stuff and send the poor to war, but this dude was the real deal and not only put himself in the middle of the fight, but as part of the unit with the highest casualty rate of the whole war.

>The problem is two-fold.

>A: Stolen guns. ie. Legal guns. Not there? Not stolen. 
  
Stolen firearms make up an extremely small percentage of those used to perpetrate violent acts, and theft is largely limited by following our already extensive storage regulations.

>B: Third party, criminal buyers. Can't buy the legal guns? No more criminal buyers.  
  
There are 2 documented cases of straw purchasing in the last 15 years, and both parties were caught because of our already robust regulations.  


>Of course this would all have to come hand-in-hand with anti-smuggling efforts, but you'd be surprised as to how easy that is.  
  
Super easy, right? That's why the police have such an easy time stopping all the illegal border jumpers, drug shipments, cigarettes,  etc that make their way across the *longest unprotected border in the world* .  Right, super easy. 
  
> It's not like there's this huge demand for these kinda guns in Canada, the assault type, etc. aside from an ultra-minorty criminal element, and 'sporting' types. So let's simply stop flooding our streets with guns. 
  
The streets aren't flooded with guns, especially not assault rifles. Also, assault rifles are already prohibited.

>Most importantly, we have to recognize that the US approach on it has failed. No reason to adopt it.  
  
I'm suggesting nothing remotely close.  Part of the reason we have a recent spike is *because of US regulations*. They have a mishmash of laws at the federal, state, and county levels when it comes to firearms. Every region is different, and *we share a border with all of them*. Our laws are extremely robust, and they're the same for everyone regardless if you're in Moncton or Whitehorse. Do you even know what they are? What characteristics make a firearm Non-Restricted, Restricted, or Prohibited? What the storage and transportation laws are that surround each category? What the licensing requirements are? What the usage requirements are? What the purchasing requirements are?  
  
I'm betting no"
