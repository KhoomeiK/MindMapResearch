spacex,fenf9gp,t3_eq24ap,1579283428.0,Does anyone know anywhere that would be open in the morning to go to and see the launch in person?
facepalm,fdxozw2,t1_fdwzp5r,1578771363.0,"I was certainly the only one in my school at least. I still get excited when I meet other Reids. Especially ""ei"" Reids. 

Had another Reid join the last company I was at and literally found him to say hello on his first day. Ended up doing client meetings together. Made for a good laugh during intros."
facepalm,fdxoh7c,t1_fdwy1i9,1578771256.0,Yes. Every teacher ever.
facepalm,fdwilob,t1_fdvmcy7,1578759011.0,Here to upvote a fellow Reid. Now go get yourself a cookie!

DeTrashed,f8gl9ki,t3_e0s3pi,1574561414.0,The saddest part was that all of this was within 6 feet of a garbage bag where people couldâ€™ve disposed of their trash properly. The weirdest thing I saw on the hike though was a bunch of air masks. Who just throws those on the ground?
