Nothing bad about simplistic approaches, and I did try to read the whole convo and I gave up, that ""forum"" is impossible to read/follow. I guess there's a reason Linux is in the state it is, can't say I feel bad for any of its devs.

Again, the patterns might be divergent in what the devs are trying to achieve with spinlock on Windows and what happens on Linux due to different scheduler design philosophies, but calling it ""incorrect locking"" is subjective, doesn't help anyone, and in fact just weakens Linux. If Windows can handle it properly, there is no excuse for Linux to not be able to. Now it all clicked for me as to why nobody uses Linux, it's shit like this ""hurp durp my scheduler is SPECIAL and you have to REWRITE ALL YOUR LOCKS to get into the special boy club, deal with it"" that creates an entry barrier (which I suspect is partially intentional at this point)."
