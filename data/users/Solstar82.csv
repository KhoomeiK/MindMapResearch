perfect thanks, ordered :)

> Good question. People generally make a hole somewhere on the case and stick the switch through. I don't have anything on the left slot (or anything bulky... I actually use the left slot to do NMIs) so I just pass it through the left expansion slot.

No i meant the chip itself, not the switch. it does not need soldering, so i can just plop in there..but where exactly?"
amiga,ffmvz0g,t1_ffmluxz,1580059503.0,"> If you haven't ordered a gotek, it'll help you if you get one with FlashFloppy preinstalled, OLED screen, speaker (you can disable it via config file if you hate it later) and digital wheel for changing disks. Look at the options at: https://amigastore.eu/en/323-usb-floppy-emulator-gotek.html#/

Thanks! i have not bought it yet so i might as well get it from here. which other fields i need to compile in that page? like Hx\flashfloppy etc?

ok but if i don't ""mod"" it?let's say i just buy a gotek and put it there. will it be identified as dfo (if i replace the disk drive entilery)or as df1 if i plug it in ""externally"", right?"
amiga,fflteqb,t1_ffl36w9,1580043867.0,"> Yes. That's what these DF0 switches mounted on CIA socket do. They can make external floppy be df0 at will. Else you get normal df0 internal df1+ external.

ok so other than a gotek i also need to find a way to change those cia sockets?

Do install FlashFloppy open firmware into your gotek. Get an encoder wheel if you haven't for the gotek, to easily switch floppies. Leave the internal floppy drive where it is, so that you can still use Amiga floppies, and as the gotek is external, you can see its screen, change floppies with ease, and have the gotek free to quickly attach to other computers you might have or get in the future.

but can i switch it to DFO if i don't want to use my main drive?
