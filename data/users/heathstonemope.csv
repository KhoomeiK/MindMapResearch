IllegalLifeProTips,fgkpt5k,t3_eytu2x,1580870951.0,"Look man you are going about this in the wrong way and will likely end up getting yourself in huge gigantic trouble. You need to fix this problem LEGALLY. Here is how you play by the rules and win:

1.	Contact the school and make it known that she is being bullied, by who, and ask what they are going to do about it. Say you are considering your legal options. Second part is important, it tells them you mean business
2.	if they don’t do shit, you consider your legal options. Go find a lawyer, file for a temporary restraining order, file for an injunction, etc. This is all legitimate, and how you solve problems when the school won’t handle it themselves. 
3.	file a civil lawsuit for assault or battery(if there is touching involved) for the emotional damages being caused to your daughter. This goes directly towards the kids, the school, their parents. Failure to protect, etc. Nothing like a good civil suit to scare the shit out of administrative types

This is just what I thought of in like one minute.

Most important part: I am not YOUR lawyer and this is not legal advice. My real advice is that you consult with a lawyer who can, maybe, do these things for you. And who can legally help you out, because it sounds like you really about to do some drastic stupid stuff which you should not do"
