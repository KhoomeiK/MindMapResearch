Decha's cream rinse (without bathing) will help, and dermoscent essential 6 is a good product per veterinary dermatologists I've spoken with. Also when you do bathe switch to something gentle and soap free like allergroom."
dogs,feslutb,t3_eqhojf,1579366595.0,"From your second hand description, it sounds like your friend has the right idea.  Teaching behaviors you want to stick in terms of a default, like sit and down first, in a variety of circumstances is a strategy some people use. You don't want a dog that defaults to some trick type behaviors like ""paw"" or ""speak"" because it's the first thing it learned as a puppy. Those types of behaviors are less important and can be taught later. 

Hand signals are easier, especially at first, though adding in verbal commands will increase utility. I'd personally start working on recall now, but her strategy for recalling a small puppy will likely work in many cases."
dogs,feltsct,t1_fekkpkx,1579230748.0,">People plain and simple do not want to train their dogs.

This is so true and it absolutely baffles me. The training game is absolutely the best and most interesting thing about owning a dog, and the way in which you develop a language to communicate with a dog.  

Getting a dog and not wanting to train it is like wanting a significant other but not wanting to speak to them."
dogs,fdixxsq,t3_elm6iu,1578453577.0,"Not a collie but a sheltie owner here. Hair stays on the dog unless brushed. Brush for 5 minutes daily, little to no hair in the house or on clothes. In my opinion the most manageable coat type as it doesn't require the specialized grooming a ""hair"" type non shedding coat does. I will intentionally select dogs with this coat type in the future."
dogs,fdfk8ey,t3_el3jd5,1578363647.0,"I'd rather see a cat declawed than euthanized. I'd rather see a dog have it's bark softened than surrendered, (or put in a bark collar which I personally think are barbaric). I'd rather see a dog docked than suffered from happy tail. I'd rather see a potential breeding animal cropped and participating in showing than not (though I think the akc needs to change on this point). 

These are not things that are on the table for my personal animals, but sometimes they are the least harmful choices that we can make. I'm more for educating people on alternatives than forcibly taking options off the table potentially to the detriment of the animals."

dogs,fc3wob9,t3_eg1u1g,1577400552.0,If your vet is concerned about allergies your options are limited ingredient balanced home cooked diets or prescription limited ingredient/novel protein diets. Non prescription diets are usually contaminated with ingredients that may cause allergic dogs to flare. Consider asking for referral to a veterinary nutritionist if balance it is too expensive. It's a one or two time cost but in the long run should come out to be cheaper. Though nothing about feeding a large dog home cooked food will be cheap. If you don't want to stay on the cytopoint/special diets you can ask about the possibility of ruling out or in food allergies via food trial and then proceeding to allergy testing and immunotherapy.
dogs,fc10dbl,t3_efkrak,1577304653.0,If this were my dog I would drive to where ever I needed to to find an emergency vet. My understanding of grape toxicity is that it has an extremely variable level of toxicity and your dog is exhibiting concerning symptoms.

Junk mail and cardboard or cheap plushies from the thrift store (under supervision) are great candidates. Plushies can be restuffed and sewn for even more fun! 

Toys that you don't want destroyed should be picked up and reserved for structured play :)"
dogs,fc0j4ep,t3_efgqd2,1577291972.0,"I've heard vets say they've seen it, but I'd personally feel comfortable giving them with supervision. They're incredibly caloric though, that would be my primary concern."
