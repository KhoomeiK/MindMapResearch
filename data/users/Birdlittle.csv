E.g. If you're v good with children and say nice things about them while saying you personally don't want kids, everyone will say you'll change your mind one day. If you're a rude asshole and vocalise often how you think your life is great because you don't have kids, people assume you're envious. 

As someone who doesn't insult other people's choices but does make it clear I do not like children for extended periods of time (eg I visit my nieces for a week at a time, and if they cry I pass them on to their mum), I *still* get told I really secretly want kids.

ireland,ffmbczj,t1_ffm9vcn,1580051782.0,"Again, I'm not so sure you can say they would ""certainly"" enforce the law on normal people. There was v little police work to be done in my brother's case - he was caught in the act of committing property damage, the theft had been recorded on CCTV and he had been found in possession of the stolen items, and he's been caught with drugs on his person multiple times. In fairness the theft is supposedly going through the courts, but its been three years now and nothing has happened. And from what I could tell, there was absolutely no effort put into formally identifying and charging the guy who torched our house, despite us telling them who it was and that he'd told us he would be doing it.

My point isn't that traveller culture does or does not incite violence. I don't know enough on the statistics to argue that. My point is that a poor education and lack of economic prospects do lead to crime - whether that be in the traveling community or among ""normal"" people. I've met a higher proportion of ""normal"" people that aren't criminals than travelers, but when I restrict those I've encountered to just those raised in a similar environment to me, the drug usage / criminal activity skyrockets. Given we see such a range of outcomes for people within our own culture based on socioeconomic factors, perhaps socioeconomic factors better explain the high crime rate among travelers than does ""traveler culture"". Certainly I don't think only one or the other explains the issue."
ireland,fflw3hh,t1_fflexp3,1580044917.0,"I lived in Sligo until I was 9 and saw this too. In my younger years it was easy to agree ""travellers just have a rotten culture"". I'd lived on a council estate with 3 settled traveler families and about 15 kids between them, and they'd band together and bully everyone. Of course, I had five siblings myself, but they were much quieter + younger. I remember once my younger brother's tricycle was stolen, and my dad went over to their house to talk to the parents and get it back (we could see it in their front yard) - he came back without it. 

When my dad split and left the country, the traveller families threatened to burn our house down if we didn't leave, cos we had a corner house with a big yard, and they wanted it. We told the council, who told us we should just leave actually bc it was unsafe to stay - they didn't do anything about it. So we left Sligo and moved to Waterford.

It's easy to see that and go : traveler children are bullies, travelers threaten violence to get what they want, the council just give em what they want because they're scared. 

But when we were in Waterford and my brothers got into drugs, it wasn't travelers who actually torched our shed, or set fire to our sitting room. It was the other settled dilinquents on our new estate. It wasn't travelers that my brother owed drug money to that had him flee to the other end of the country, or travelers that got my younger brother into dealing himself. And, just like the traveler families, when my brother got into legal trouble, for theft, for drugs, for damage to property - they didn't do anything. He spent about a week in jail and otherwise has spent every day of his life free. That's not about being well-connected or intimidating - they just don't give a fuck, and it's easier to turf out an aggressive bloke than try to provide him with mental health care. We told them who had torched our house because the guy had told us he was going to do it - but the gardai didn't do shit. The guy wasn't a traveler, and was known to cause trouble. But nothing happened. 

Economic hardship + a lack of education pushes people into crime. It doesn't make the crime ok, but it happens. For some reason when settled folk lash out and cause trouble - even when there are entire communities of people on the end of their rope and hurting each other - it's a symptom of individual failure, and not cultural failing. Yet when travelers act out its a sign their entire culture is bad.

But, speaking from experience, so does ours - I should imagine those that haven't experienced it firsthand simply aren't aware of how widespread it is. Yet we hold ourselves above them, rather than trying to bridge that gap to help us all.

And our justice system is God awful. People see travellers go free and assume it's cos the gardai are scared of them. Yet my brother was just a young thug with no connections, and he got off scott free. The guy who torched our shed and tried to set fire to our house had illusions of being a bad boy, but he wasn't shit either, and nothing happened to him. 

I'm not saying there is no intimidation factor stopping the gardai. I don't know why they're so incompetent, or why they appear to be in communities like mine. Why they let the local drug dealers ruin lives. But it's not just travelers they let off the hook."

Saying ""this name makes me unhappy so it's not happening"", though, without considering that the *absence * of the name makes the other person unhappy too, is wrong, imo. There are two people here, and the optimal result is whichever makes *both* of them happiest. Unlimited veto power may achieve that, if you're a couple where neither has a specific name they desperately want due to emotional attachments. Or it may not - eg if there is only one name that will make you happy (extreme example, i know) then the option to veto every other name presented by your partner doesn't make you any happier.

Of course, objectively measuring who the name / lack thereof matters to the most is hard. I think this is a case that should have extensive discussion, though, and an example of when ""unlimited veto power"" sounds fair but may not be."

ukpolitics,fejcooa,t1_fejbz7r,1579167438.0,"I agree it is often poorly presented, but there are other explanations for the pay gap.

Careers become less respectable / less highly paid when women move into them, or become more respectable / more highly paid when women are pushed out of them by men, for example. See computer programming and biology. Generally people brush this off by saying ""but women choose poorly paying careers"" when historically, careers chosen by women tend to be devalued, even if they require the same education level / commitment to work as careers chosen by men.

The following article discusses this more, but it's not a novel idea. 

[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/upshot/as-women-take-over-a-male-dominated-field-the-pay-drops.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/upshot/as-women-take-over-a-male-dominated-field-the-pay-drops.html)

Nevermind the fact that women's choice of which career they want is influenced by a culture rooted in sexism. I work in astrophysics, and the number of college-aged women I have met who would not be remaining in science because of poor experiences / looking at what the research tells them their career will be like is ridiculous. In STEM this is generally referred to as the ""leaky pipeline"" -- lots of people interested in a career to start with (decent numbers of people studying the subject at university), which drops off (first a big drop going to PhD, then a big drop going to postdoc, then a big drop going to tenure track). 

Of course, the leaky pipeline is partially explained by the whole child rearing falling on women / women sacrificing their career for their partner thing, but also when women tell you ""i chose not to do this because I got groped / my contributions were constantly ignored in favour of men / i was constantly spoken down to"", maybe we should listen.

&#x200B;

I'm not saying you necessarily agree / disagree with any of the above -- perhaps you know it all already, and just take umbridge with the articles discussing the pay gap as though it's an executive sitting in his office deciding to pay Mandy less than Mark for the identical job (though that happens occasionally, it's a lawsuit waiting to happen). 

But I personally take umbridge when the gap is explained away as though it's women's fault for choosing crappy jobs, when the jobs they tend to choose are devalued as soon as they become popular with women; or that because women are expected to do child rearing / sacrifice their careers for their partner's, that's just their choice, not something that needs to be addressed by society."

science,fdsuqi7,t1_fds6q9d,1578708193.0,"I would argue that gun control may help some suicidal people, if there are stringent background checks / mental health evaluation required to own a gun. Suicide is most often opportunistic and impulsive; if instead of picking up the gun from under your bed you have to drive to a tall place or purchase a length of rope, the time delay might be enough to save your life. Add to that the fact that guns are fare more effective at ending life than other suicide methods; you might survive a high fall, or an improperly tied rope, or a poorly judged dosage of pills, but you're very unlikely to survive a bullet to the head. 

Of course, I think there are better ways to reduce suicide rates in the US than gun control -- addressing the woeful lack of mental health support would be a good start, and probably a better use of taxpayer money than arguments about guns that never get anywhere. I just feel it's disingenuous to brush off the number of gun-related suicides as though, because they are caused by underlying problems, they were not exacerbated by easy access to a gun."

I hadn't come in to discuss anything remotely related to my parents, and I'm still happy with my decision not to speak to them -- yet a therapist specialised in family counseling tried to pressure me into letting toxic people into my life. Even my younger brother informing the therapist my mother had gotten him hooked on drugs didn't persuade her we were better off without her.

fosterit,fddo9nc,t1_fdaybw4,1578319379.0,"Oh no, I didn't mean to imply it's a consequence of fostering -- I was fostered, and have many half-siblings, and I believe that's why blood means so little to me (my half-siblings are just as good as my full siblings, and I don't care for my parents at all, so blood feels irrelevant). Rather that it is normal to value siblings you've never met, and that foster children are more in need of familial connection, generally.

EDITL also, feelings of not fitting in, of detachment etc are generally stronger in foster children than adults, I find. I often felt I didn't fit in as a kid but don't really care now."
fosterit,fdavb9n,t1_fdas6zh,1578250670.0,"I promise you that even if you add ""we're going to move in X years"", the child's caseworker will not care. Social workers are so obscenely overworked -- don't underestimate this. They may assure you that it's fine for XYZ reason, either because they don't care that the child will be traumatised, or because they just want to delay addressing the problem. 

Besides, even if the child begins as ""ideal"" for your future plans, they may not stay that way. Imagine a lone child with no extended family, i.e. only relatives are the parents, who have been told they will never contact the child again (which, for the record, is virtually unheard of in fostering, in my country at least). No strings attached, just a lone child. You move. That child's parents then have another baby. Now, personally I wouldn't care about a sibling I've never met; but many foster / adopted children suffer from feelings of abandonment, of feeling like they don't fit anywhere, of detachment from those around them -- and maintaining a relationship with blood relatives, even those who appear after they have been placed in care, can be valuable.

Nevermind that even a child with no blood relatives, who will never have blood relatives, will have an attachment to where they live, to their friends. Unless you adopt a newborn baby, they will have been through trauma before, and may suffer terribly if they are uprooted from their entire lives for a second time. Already having been cut off from family when younger, they are now cut off from friends, teachers, neighbours, and their local area.

People move after adopting children all the time. Shit happens. But to knowingly plan to do so, particularly over such a distance, is nothing short of cruel.

Having a child at 35 is not old at all. Having a child at 40 is not old, even. In Ireland (where I live), the \*average\* age a mother has her first child is 33. In the states I believe it's closer to 27. Note that this is referring to age of \*first birth\*, not last, and that your age is far less relevant than for most women given you needn't worry about biological concerns."
todayilearned,fdat6kp,t1_fdakk0g,1578249800.0,"Perhaps I'm biased given my field -- astrophysics. There are of course some ""profitable"" applications here, e.g. satellite usage, medical technology, etc, but there isn't much profit to be had in the pursuit of black hole physics, or in planet formation studies. So most of our funding, as far as I can tell, comes either from universities (those that have the budget for it); from the government directly in research grants; or from bodies that are funded almost entirely by the government, e.g. the European Space Agency (ESA)."
todayilearned,fdaecyp,t1_fd9zk24,1578245173.0,"In many countries, the government already funds a lot of the science done. It would have to be done very carefully, otherwise it's likely funding would simply be moved from other research endeavours, rather than coming from e.g. army budget."
AmItheAsshole,fda1wi8,t1_fd9znz3,1578240765.0,"I have short hair and I'm tall for a girl, so I get misgendered from behind sometimes. It's annoying, sure. But generally trans people suffer from gender dysphoria -- a severe disconnect with their physical anatomy not matching up with the gender wired in their brain -- so it is going to be more stressful for a trans person to be misgendered than a cis person the vast majority of the time (excepting for women who get upset they look manly, men who don't want to look girly, etc). 

A trans person who is misgendered has two large concerns on top of just not feeling pretty / handsome: it can trigger their dysphoria, i.e. provoke a very strong reaction by reminding them their physical features don't match their brain (often prompting feelings of disgust, shame, self-hatred, etc); and they are reminded that they don't pass as their gender, which, for a trans person, can be life-threatening, as assault is not a rare occurrence.

Cis people do not suffer from gender dysphoria, and generally don't have to fear for their lives if they correct someone who misgenders them. Also, for most cis people, being misgendered will be a much rarer occurrence than for trans people, particularly those in the earlier stages of transition (when they may also be feeling more vulnerable)."
Instagramreality,fd9yve9,t1_fd9xw6m,1578239732.0,"Agreed. Her waist isn't thick in that photo, although perhaps looks thicker than it is due to angle. Even if there are no angles at play, there are a lot of people who have frames like that -- often described as having ""boxy"" figures."
insaneparents,fd8wbz3,t1_fd63336,1578224383.0,"I agree, mostly. People can be broken through no fault of their own, and do broken things. To be honest, the line between just ""messed up"", mentally unwell, or just in a bad place doesn't really matter, though. If we accept that people are shaped by their environment, then the line of what's justifiable / what isn't is completely arbitrary. I don't say that to mean that parents who fuck up should just be left to rot, ostracized from society, or anything like that. They should receive help -- but not from their children, not unless that child truly considers whether it's worth it or not.

Like, I haven't spoken to either of my parents in about 6 years. Cut contact with my father at 13 and mother at 16. I don't hate them. I consider them terrible people, people that made terrible mistakes, but I don't hate them. I don't begrudge my siblings for trying to build a relationship with them. The closest I get to feeling anything towards them would probably be pity -- certainly not love.

I'm glad the person above was able to stick around through the insanity and that the insanity got better. That doesn't mean people should always stick around through insane behaviour, or that it will always get better -- often it doesn't."
EntitledPeople,fd8d1ts,t1_fd7p7yu,1578217074.0,"To be fair, the person above you said that the person who parked in the zone was ALSO handicapped. I think by blanketing people who say ""I would have to walk miles"" as lazy, just because they're not in a wheelchair, that's also a denial of handicap struggles. The person should not have parked there, but it's possible they -- like other dumbasses who do the same -- just didn't know why the zone reached out so far, if they're not wheelchair bound. That doesn't make them lazy. If they didn't know it makes them ignorant  and an asshole (for ignoring rules they don't understand), if they did know it makes them selfish and an asshole; but neither makes them lazy.

I think the real problem in the above scenario is a lack of disabled parking spots at the store. The girl and her caretaker waited 20 minutes for a spot, and then there clearly wasn't one when the other handicapped person arrived. That's not ok. The dude parking where he did was also not ok."

badwomensanatomy,fd2hah6,t1_fczmeh7,1578147214.0,"Yes, I know that weight is a force. My profession is astrophysics, and I, too, use the term ""weight"" in everyday speech, because people around me wouldn't understand me otherwise. To be honest, though, this is counter to the point you're trying to make -- people don't use weight colloquially because they understand the difference between weight in a scientific sense and weight to mean how much mass something has in a colloquial sense, they use it because they don't understand the difference. The fact that society in general uses this term is reflective of a poor grasp of physics -- not on an individual level, as people adapt to the speech of those around them, but on the whole.

Again, that's fine, just like the gravity example, because it doesn't affect them in everyday life. Not understanding / knowing the terms to describe their own anatomy isn't fine, because it very well can affect people in their everyday life. Further, there is no ambiguity in the general populace using the word ""weight"" colloquially, as \~100% of the time that term is used outside of a lab it is used in the colloquial sense (I know a large number of physicists, and even the most pedantic of them wouldn't use weight in a scientific meaning outside of their work). The term ""vagina"", though, has a very mixed usage in the general populace -- with many people using it correctly, and many people using it incorrectly. Medical information, if people are trying to find that, will have the technically correct terminology, leading those who use it incorrectly to have a poor understanding of what they're reading."
badwomensanatomy,fczko6p,t1_fcza2s0,1578103322.0,"I don't really grasp your analogy -- this isn't about the lack of technical jargon in everyday speech, but about incorrectly applied terminology pointing to a fundamental misunderstanding of anatomy. A better example would be people saying something factually incorrect yet commonly accepted, like, idk, thinking that there's no gravity in outer space.

Note, though, that people thinking the wrong thing about gravity in outer space doesn't really change much for the average lay person -- knowing the laws of physics isn't really going to affect them medically, or make them feel ashamed of their bodily functions.

If a woman is trying to diagnose some genital discomfort, though, and the only thing she knows the name of is ""vagina"" and thinks that that is the whole of what's down there -- that's a problem. A lack of understanding of one's own body is a problem. Because poor women's anatomy is ubiquitous across society, it is referred to as a societal problem.

As evidence that it's not a case of ""technical jargon"", you wouldn't see people leaping to correct someone who described a woman's ""pussy"", ""fanny"", etc, beyond perhaps calling the language crude, because there's nothing to correct. Whereas if it suddenly became commonplace that the whole of the male genitalia was referred to as testicles (not analogous, but I believe a technical term that is as widely used as vagina) then people would want to correct that, so a boy searching for pain in his penis wouldn't be stuck trying to work out why all he was getting was information on testicular cancer."

Men are conditioned to be more uncomfortable with medical operations than women, reinforced by the fact their physical pain is taken more seriously, and they are squeamish about anything relating to their genitalia.
