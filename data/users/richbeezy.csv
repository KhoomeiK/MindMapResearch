From CNBC article:

The aftermath and lessons learned
Many people still ask me about TARP, a government program that provided funding to banks in the midst of the crisis. JPMorgan Chase did not want or need TARP money, but we recognized that if the healthy banks did not take it, no one else could — out of fear that the market would lose confidence in them. And while it helped create the false rallying cry that all banks needed support, the government, both the Federal Reserve and Treasury, was trying everything it could in addition to TARP.

Every “movement” has their extreme, fringe viewpoints from idiots within each of them.
