unitedkingdom,fed5hb3,t1_fed3swb,1578999843.0,"Isn't this a bit like arguing that tax cuts for billionaires ""boost the economy"" and are therefore good for the unemployed and the low waged?

Interesting how people from different sides of the political divide choose to frame these things. That argument is essentially trickle down economics."
JordanPeterson,fed20l8,t1_fed14nz,1578994745.0,"> I've literally never seen someone blame a white male personally. The opposite is true: Poc are and have been brow beaten by white males

What difference does it make whether you blame a white male or a POC *personally*?

How do you make a distinction on whether someone is being blamed *personally* or as part of a group?

Is it ok to blame black people for crime as long as you don't do it *personally*?"
unitedkingdom,fed1ry7,t1_feao82e,1578994379.0,"If you want cheap labour it's pretty good.

If you are cheap labour it's not so good."
ukpolitics,fed0dol,t1_fecrrds,1578992377.0,Very few people *have* to. Most people do it because they prefer it to working in McDonalds.

My favourite kind of comment."
ukpolitics,feb0qil,t1_feaiz4h,1578954277.0,"> but I presume that they didn't like the optics of it as people would have made a big deal of them giving scholarships to white people. 

This is pretty much what ""woke"" is."
Showerthoughts,feb0o79,t1_feap5m3,1578954256.0,"So you're just going to bug other people to do it for you?

Because that's what the whole ""toilet seat down"" thing is *really* about."
ukpolitics,feai81k,t1_feaeo8d,1578949077.0,"So, not the *most woke thing in the universe* then.

But still pretty woke."
ukpolitics,feai5g0,t1_feahc3h,1578949034.0,"Why did they choose to refuse it?

Just for the hell of it?

Here's a million quid. Nah. Don't want it. For no reason? Really?"
Showerthoughts,fea6kay,t3_eo8jye,1578944933.0,"It's bullshit.

The reason women want the toilet seat down is that they don't like *touching* it.

They realise that it's a bit hypocritical to insist that men touch it so they don't have to especially when men do it without even thinking about it so they make up the ""I mIgHt FaLl In"" excuse.

It's not the real reason. They just don't like touching the toilet seat."
unitedkingdom,fea65b8,t1_fea5kcu,1578944811.0,"See you have the meaningless waffle bit down very well. You're good at that. Replying without really saying anything. Excellent.

It's the providing meaningful content bit where you fall down.

State your opinion, response..... *crickets*!

State your opinion, response..... I aLrEaDy SaId It.....

What you need to work on is articulating that opinion. 

I realise it's hard when the position you're defending is nonsense. That does put you at a disadvantage but the waffle you fall back on doesn't really do you any good."
unitedkingdom,fea5bsi,t1_fea4zg9,1578944537.0,"Awww. Such a shame.

You could have learned how to articulate your position.

Who knows. Maybe one day you'll learn. It's really not that hard. The key is to *have a position to articulate in the first place*.

Try concentrating on that."
