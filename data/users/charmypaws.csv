bipolar,fdyogkm,t3_encbw8,1578781954.0,This is why i don't share my mental illness w anyone other than close people who i trust not to upset me or my friends who understand / have their own battle w mental illness.
bipolar,fdt4hed,t3_emvana,1578711803.0,"super common with me too, usually happens when I feel out of control or like ive had to give up control in my life for some reason. Bipolar brain just starts connecting things that you know are kinda illogical but just make sense for some reason. For me its usually angel numbers are signs directing me to do things and thinking i can control electricity with my emotions. totally ridiculous when i explain them but very real feeling in the moment im experiencing them."

bipolar,fcjkgqi,t3_ehd9la,1577691237.0,"Just started back on Lamotrigine again after half a year off it (I'm a week in)!! Going through that rough adjustment period right now but its really worth it once the dosage gets higher. I remember how amazed I was when my brain fog finally went away, like oh shit this is how i'm supposed to feel. Good luck to you hope things keep getting better!"
