Don’t fear death, we are all heading there, but meet it head on while living life without regrets."
news,ffp695v,t3_eubjfc,1580087287.0,"Like him or not, if you find yourself in any way celebrating this tragedy, you seriously need to be evaluated by a psychiatrist. Honestly, no joke. I am not in the least a fan of the NBA, but you at least have to acknowledge this abrupt and saddening loss of life. Rest in eternal peace to all on that heli."
RealEstate,ffnswx1,t1_ffm2j6z,1580070361.0,"As someone who was successful with rentals, yet sold them anyways, I second the motion. It is getting harder and harder to find good tenants, sad to say. Index funds are the way to go."
reddevils,ffm8hrr,t3_ets563,1580050319.0,"Not to be negative, but if we lose today, I am not watching another United match for the remainder of this season... I can’t take much more of that shit."
reddevils,ffgk1he,t3_etf4b0,1579908021.0,"So fans buy tickets to game. Ticket revenue enters United cash flow. Glazers drain cash from club and/or use it to pay Woodward’s salary. 

Only then do fans walk out??? Seems pointless. How about don’t by the <beep>ing ticket???"
soccer,ffb0zg4,t3_esi5sd,1579749105.0,This is exactly how Anthony Martial shoots on goal...

Edit: 2020. Jesus"
reddevils,ffa2fli,t3_eshenq,1579726537.0,"All it takes is seconds to score with barely a chance, so why does Martial not score a fucking one of ‘em?"
reddevils,ffa27bp,t1_ffa24l9,1579726404.0,You are spot on. Truly sad. We’re almost there. Just 3-4 of the right players...
reddevils,ffa1zvh,t1_ffa1w6r,1579726283.0,Bissaka is solid. James and Williams also pulling weight. Mata is a liability and Martial is allergic to scoring.
reddevils,ffa1rmb,t3_eshenq,1579726150.0,Martial is literally goal repellent.
reddevils,ffa1p6d,t1_ffa1mcx,1579726110.0,Lol. I think sadly you know the answer. Just no final polish...
reddevils,ffa1daw,t3_eshenq,1579725918.0,"One day I was walking in my garden and I saw a sparkle. I thought “what is that shiny thing over there?”  When I got up more closely, it was dogshit glimmering in the sun. And that friends is Andreas P. Some matches you see brilliance, but any other time, he’s shit."

aww,ff5sweq,t1_ff5245z,1579608998.0,Ironic that this site is literally called “read it”...
