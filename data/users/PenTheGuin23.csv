AnxietyDepression,fey96t0,t1_fexueo5,1579442380.0,"Exactly! If you don’t have any sort of Hope than you feel empty... but at the same time it hurts more if it doesn’t work out. 

Yeah I feel you, I’m similar but like with God (more spiritual than religious but still), I see those posts where it’s like “put your trust in God, when you feel like you can’t do more yourself”, and I try to. I really do. It’s just hard when you’re like “but nothing is working out like I wanted??” You know? Trying to have trust, but it’s hard sometimes."
AnxietyDepression,fey8l09,t1_fexhqrg,1579442134.0,"You’re very lucky if you don’t get heartache, and I’m a bit jealous lol 

I do try to say to myself “ok so it might now work out, you just gotta keep trying”, I think that it’s just after being rejected more often than not... it just kind of gets to you; you start being like “well why do I bother”. If you can avoid that sinkhole, kudos. It’s very easy for me to fall into."
AnxietyDepression,fey7w60,t1_fewc7dd,1579441936.0,"That’s very true. It’s just a bit hard not to have expectations, you know. I try to just say “oh well, it didn’t work out” but it just gets to you after a while I guess. 

But thanks. I like that phrase “act on what you want to see come into fruition”, I’m gonna try to keep it in mind."
depression,few5w83,t3_eqenne,1579405820.0,"I kind of get similar when it feels like nobody wants me around (if that makes sense). Like my voice will just mute itself with certain triggers. 

Eg. Girl at work being rude to me when I was only trying to be helpful. Even when someone else addressed me I had a hard time getting words out. Or a family member yelling at me and telling me they don’t wanna hear it (my opinions, my defense for myself, etc), I stop talking for hours. 

I’m not sure if yours is similar (like maybe because you’re so full of other people’s negative opinions about you (whether true or imagined) it just causes you to go mute like it does to me (if that makes sense? I’m not sure)."
AnxietyDepression,few4wos,t1_few1rga,1579405419.0,"Background process huh? I guess I just have to try to not let it stop me? It’s just hard sometimes. 

I’ll try. I guess I already did something similar? 

I wasn’t gonna apply to this job posting today - It was one I Really wanted to apply to but I just kept thinking “no one thinks you have the experience. No one wants you. It’s not worth the effort” so I put it up on IG because I know plenty of others who might want to apply to it instead, but a friend talked me into it. 

And idk there’s a part of me that like ‘you’re just gonna be crushed again’ (I apply to things constantly and either don’t hear back, or they want me for a different area that’s not related to my field; I’m not sure which is worse). But then there’s the ‘what if’ part... back and forth, back and forth. “Don’t hope because it’s hopeless” and “but what if”. Sigh. It just makes me want to do nothing but sleep so I don’t have to deal with the thoughts."
depression,few2xwp,t3_eqlpaf,1579404720.0,"Yeah for me it’s Facebook that’s toxic. The worst for me is going onto the comments for a random post - usually a meme or video or something - and just seeing pointless arguing and hate in the comments. Like really? This is so important? And the political posts family members supporting Either party is annoying. ...And why I stay out of politics. 

I guess I’m lucky with Instagram, I use it to post my art :) So I mainly just follow family, old friends, and other artists I either like or want to support (not knowing them irl but becoming friends with them through IG (or one I knew from DeviantArt who became a great supportive friend from IG)).  

Well, you have (as I see it) 3 choices: 
1) log off all social media and ignore it (whether it’s forever or just temporarily to start feeling better, is up to you) 

2) go through your friends lists and delete the ones that cause you grief, or at least block their posts (I had to do this for my aunt and cousins on the one side who put up some very messed up political stuff a few years ago) And maybe in the case of Instagram try finding other accounts that hold your interest, (and look at their previous posts before following, to make sure you’re not getting the same stuff). 

3) Continue as you are and do your best to ignore it 🤷🏻‍♀️

Good luck! Hope my advice wasn’t preachy or anything. Just trying to offer some"
depression,few0n95,t3_cml6ni,1579403787.0,"Just wondering if it’s better to be hopeful or doubtful when you’re waiting on something. 

Is it better to tell yourself to doubt because if it all falls through it may hurt less? 

Or is it simply better to Hope because the doubt is making your depression worse; “why did I even bother trying”, “it won’t work out”, “nobody wants me”, etc? 

But if you hope and it falls through... how much will it hurt? 😔"
depression,fevzmvx,t3_eqpqzk,1579403496.0,"Mmm yeah, I’m pretty sure it doesn’t help that much. Maybe the idea is that if it helps with your physical health, than that also helps your mental health? 🤔 (Like I know walking is supposed to regulate your system.) No idea though. 

But kudos to you for running and freaking weight-lifting while depressed, that is impressive. Some days I can’t even brush my hair. 

If it’s not working for you though, forget the workouts. Try other things to help yourself. And don’t listen to the people who just don’t get what you’re saying. Everyone is different and what works for them may not work for you and vice versa."
AskReddit,feo03xl,t3_eq1wzh,1579293311.0,"If an employer for a good company, that was near enough to get to, called me and was like “I like your work, I’m giving you a chance and hiring you as a freelance [animator, storyboarder, concept artist, ....literally anything in my field]”. 

I wouldn’t care if it was full time or part time or whatever. Even just having the experience would be helpful."

Forget about the people who forgot. Take the next few days to do things that make You happy. Give yourself a gift. Depression is the worst, it’ll make you feel so low, unwanted. Try not to listen to it. Just look at all the strangers on here that want you to have a happy birthday and to feel better (myself included) :)

   THE       penguin

lol so I guess I’m The Penguin. Hmm I’m supposed to be a superhero ...and I’m a female, so I wouldn’t be the DC villain. I guess I would be the opposite. Hmm, so instead of being a gangster man who looks like a penguin. I’d be a penguin who looks like a woman? 

Fuck it. I’m a penguin who can transform into a woman and retain all of my penguin attributes- slick belly sliding, can swim in freezing cold temperatures, and if I slap you it’s like being slapped with an oversized penguin fin. There. I love it lol 

Who’s my nemesis? xD"
AskReddit,fenai5r,t3_eq1k8q,1579280510.0,"Oh man, asking the questions I really have to think about. Well, Assuming that I really loved this person, could see myself having a future with them... I guess they would have to at least tolerate it, even if they disliked it. But their reasons for being homophobic would HAVE to be because of religion. 

This might be a weird mentality but, I wouldn’t want anyone who was homophobic without religious reasons to be in my life if I could help it (it makes no sense to dislike someone’s own, personal choices otherwise! Disliking gays because of religion is the only basis people really logically have, because it’s against God’s law and you want them to be Saved. And even then, especially if you’re a Christian, you’re supposed to love your neighbor anyway, even if you disagree with their choices. It’s honestly my belief that if you hate someone for being gay for no other reasons than “because”, you’re trash. You have literally zero reason. Sorry that got ranty.) Anyway yeah, I guess they wouldn’t have to like it, but they should at least tolerate it?

I have a sister who is homophobic and it’s annoying to say the least. I mean it doesn’t normally come up in conversation, the closest being when it comes to gifts for her kids - 2 girls, so everything has to be pink, girly, barbie, etc. I think her weird hatred comes from a sibling who has always been mentally abusive towards her and then became trans (you can’t even mention that sibling in front of her), and I wonder if her mind just connected the 2 things... idk. It’s a weird situation. 

But idk how much I could tolerate a SO being similar. IF (big if, because I’m not even sure I want kids tbh), we had kids and at least one of them was gay, and he was abusive in anyway towards them... me and the kids would be gone. Out. Bye. I’m not endangering my kids because you’re being an intolerant shit head. Not to mention I wasn’t raised that way (so I doubt my sister was either), growing up I had both barbies and pokemon, dolls and planes and trucks, etc. and I would want my kids to grow up similar, boy or girl. 

Also, as an artist/animator who creates stories and characters, sometimes the characters are gay. It happens. I let their personalities just come to me and it happens *shrug*. I couldn’t deal with a SO who was against my art... or who would try to get me to change things. The creative process is difficult enough as it is. 

Hmm, a lot to think about. I suppose it would depend o  his tolerance level (and the religious backing thing).

Edit: grammar"
AskReddit,fen60v9,t3_eq1m75,1579277747.0,"Animator... well not just the animation (which can be fun to design) but I also love coming up with story ideas and concepts, and character designs for animation. I wanna be a part of the entire process. 

It’s my dream and my goal. I just need someone to give me a chance, a foot in the door; so I guess I need a miracle since I’m coming from basically a no-name school and working and life taking up my time... it’s very difficult"
AskReddit,fen3ica,t3_eq1oa7,1579276160.0,"One physical characteristic: hmmm, idk, I guess I really like guys with soft-looking hair lol idk why (could be a remnant from my first crush, or it could be because my ex used to shave his head and I really don’t wanna think about him...) 

One personality characteristic: this one is a bit sad, but I think I’d like a guy who would Try, or at least make the best of a situation (optimistic?). (This one comes from a place of hurt tbh.) I can tell when people don’t like me or are disappointed by me (my appearance more so) and I think if he would just be the type to give me a chance, maybe even show it with a smile, he would have me putting up my best effort, because I would see that he’s trying, not given up. 

Idk if that makes sense. So I guess final answer would be, someone optimistic."
AskReddit,fen293i,t3_eq1oeb,1579275357.0,"Hmm, probably in a recent post actually. This is the account I use to get things off my chest - rants, confessions, deep thoughts I don’t want connected to me irl. And recently I confessed something I thought was rather humorous in one of those “get it off your chest” subreddits, and the first and only response I got was someone who I guess just wanted to help me, but it came off as frantic and (to me) like they were making a big deal out of it. 

I’m wondering if they thought I was some lost teenager or something... I’m a 25 year old woman with a lot of issues, not a teenage girl looking up to social media beauty standards or thinking about making extreme choices. (It was really one of those intrusive thoughts that I thought was messed up but funny) 

I didn’t reply back. No matter how well meaning they might have been. It felt too awkward to."
AskReddit,fen1gek,t3_eq1orr,1579274843.0,"My first thought would definitely be “join the club, we have jackets” lol. 

But in all seriousness I would take the time to discuss it (and chances are this would be the time that I mention my battle with depression, maybe we could bond); finding out what it is, how he handles it, how it could affect our relationship, and how I could help, would probably be the most important parts of the discussion. 

If we could somehow support each other, that would be even better. <3"
depression,fdho9vy,t1_fdhmtrq,1578426849.0,"Ugh people, especially teachers (especially in high school imo) can be the worst. Just try your best, especially for those that Want to help you and are understanding. And if you need a mental health day then take it. I know it can be hard with certain parents (I don’t know your situation) but sometimes you just need that day of rest. 

It is draining but you’ll get through it. Even if you have to keep a count down to something - summer, future plans, a special day, etc. that might help. 

Just do your best to keep moving forward. Good luck."
depression,fdh9r5c,t3_el8lne,1578418440.0,"I’m so happy for you! It must feel amazing to quit a job that feels so toxic and like it’s destroying you. Kudos. I hope you get another, better job. 
(And I would recommend saving those emails, and show them to future interviewers and explain the situation. You never know. People are shit and having proof would be best.) 

This makes me want to quit my job. It’s definitely not as bad as yours was, but I’m tired of feeling like I’m being treated less than a person, or talked down to. I have a similar problem where a lot of people that I was friendly with quit (some are still there but haven’t been acting like my friend in a while) and the managers that I’ve known for 2 years and are friendly with have either left, or been moved around to other shifts/areas. And these new managers are more uptight and/or not as friendly. At least not frown to the people like me who have been here a while and actually know how to do their damn jobs.  

It’s also awesome how you have another business with friends. I wish I could start up something like that. Everyone I know from college is doing their own things (also struggling) and I haven’t has as much time to work on my portfolio as I wish (artist/animator). There are so many days where I’ve been like “God I’d rather be drawing for less money instead of dealing with this stupidity for more”. 

So once again, kudos (and sorry for the long comment, you just really lit a fire in me). I hope things go well for you and that you’re much happier!"
depression,fdh823t,t3_el54zx,1578417393.0,"I feel this the most as work. I’ll be ok beforehand but as soon as I get to work and they start with their bullshit (pardon my language) it feels like my body starts to deteriorate just from the al the negativity. 

Going to that job is always a struggle, it feels like people are against me, or secretly hate me. They need me for harder tasks but don’t offer any respect or at least show any understanding that I’m a human being (it’s all very impersonal there; all of us are just numbers). 

It makes my depression Worse. Not just mentally but physically I start to feel nauseous or lightheaded, like I can’t concentrate (yesterday I started to get an optical migraine) and then it’s much more of a challenge to do tasks. 
(And then it’s a bit of a vicious cycle, if I’m like “I really don’t feel well enough to do [harder job that other people can also do, though none of us get paid more for it] today” they get pissed, and I feel like they hate me more, and then I want to do the harder jobs less... sometimes, like yesterday, I just have to leave because the physical and mental ailments are too much and I just can’t do it.) 

Sorry for the rant. Not sure if it’s exactly what you meant but this is how it is for me."
Stress,fdfjhk7,t3_el0u5f,1578363153.0,"It really depends on a lot of factors. Like my high school wasn’t the typical Hollywood stereotype (though I’ve seen plenty of ppl on here post about theirs being exactly that). 

Mine was (and still is) known for having a lot of diversity - like you could legit Google the numbers. And white students (like me) were in the lower range. So I think that was part of the reason; meeting a lot of people from different backgrounds, it just kind of breaks that idea of ...whatever tf Hollywood goes for. There were groups but we still all mixed and stuff - like sometimes I’d hang out with the art students, sometimes with my best friend since elementary who was into like band and stuff, and sometimes with people I met there. Idk about anyone else but I didn’t really have only a select few of people, all from the same group, that I was friends with. 

My school was also pretty big, like out grade had something like 444 students, and that doesn’t even count the other grades, and you should because you can make friends outside of your grade lol 

Whether you have best friends from middle school or not, you’re probably gonna meet a whole lot more people. Some people you’ll just talk to from one or 2 classes, some people will latch onto you and you’ll be friends at least through all four years, some people you may have had as friends or acquaintances in middle school and you’ll lose them in high school... it’s usually a bigger place, maybe more intimidating at first but you’ll get used to it. 

Classes wise... yeah you’re gonna have teachers who are amazing and you’ll greet in the hallways and talk with. And then you’ll have others who you don’t want to make eye contact with in the damn class haha. But no matter whether you like them or not (or they like you are not) try your best to be polite, do the work, and pass to the best of your abilities. 

(Oh and some advice that no one gives about English classes in high school, here is the secret to passing: “every single English teacher thinks that their way of writing papers is the correct way”. The best thing to do for yourself grade-wise is to go by what they teach you and apply it for that class, that year. Like don’t try to do “your version” of it, just act like “their way is the best way” and work your writing to fit that mold. 

RL ex: my sophomore teacher liked us to write wordy but “pretty” sounding essays - a lot of vocabulary, a nice flow, but a lot of “talking”. Junior year teacher wanted it strict: THIS format, with this many cited facts to support your points, no extra words, just straight to the point (completely dry and boring). (And honestly college is neither of these types of writing, but that’s a separate topic lol) the only way I passed was by following how They write, not how I write. That’s my best advice to you curriculum-wise) 

Good luck. Hope some of this helped. :) Sorry it’s long."
infp,fcaw6ud,t3_egxvnx,1577577814.0,"You know I bet a lot of people feel that way. I think I do more with writing - I’m much better at writing fanfiction rather than any original ideas. 

But you know what? A lot of people don’t have actual original ideas, a lot of times the ideas are based off of something else. And people are successful with them! I think of those animatics where people will take characters from something they like and pair it with a skit that they like (one that comes to mind is a “Heathers” version of John Mulaney’s “One Thing You Can’t replace”). They technically aren’t original ideas but they’re made with love and passion. And usually they’re hilarious. 

Try not to think “well someone else has already done this” or “this isn’t My idea” just, for now, go with what you feel. What drives you. 

That’s how we all start. 

I’m an artist, and animator (tend to post on Instagram instead of YouTube though, less of a process and I can post WIP stuff) and I’ll tell you a lot of ideas are just based off of other things and then reformed and redone in different ways. 

If you want to talk more feel free to message me :) (I’ve talked long enough, and this is probably too long) but just know that you shouldn’t overthink it. Just do whatever brings you passion, even if it isn’t original. Because we all have to start somewhere."
Stress,fb8ynt2,t3_e9gpyq,1576624979.0,"I'm sorry that you're going through all of that. Yeah, second hand stress from other people sucks, especially on top of your own. I've been there. 

It may sound selfish, but you should consider putting yourself first for a while. Let people know that you'll be there for them if they need you (especially your sister) but focus on feeling better and your midterms. Sometime's people's problems are their own. I had one sister who was badly suicidal - her teenage child went to go live with their father and cut off contact for months, accused her of being mentally abusive and told her that she hated her in a long letter; my sister was not ok for a long time, said she wanted to drive her car into the lake, and she still isn't ok right now but is just trying to move on... it hurts not being able to help someone you love, but sometimes the only thing you can do is offer to be there for them while they work through it.

And in the meantime, just work on yourself and your problems. Focus on the now: rest, get better, study for school. Offer your support but don't let other people's problems consume you. Hope this helps. Good luck on your midterms."
