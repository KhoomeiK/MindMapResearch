This was a million years ago, but it was a good sample size and seemed like decent methodology, I do remember.

aww,fddemb9,t1_fdcl39w,1578308736.0,"So this is more a financial tradition then, rather than cultural? My family is also Greek, but I never heard of living with parents until marriage being the norm, especially with kids putting off marriage until older age now. That's cool though. 

I was going to guess that you were Indian (their culture definitely does this, living with parents until marriage) but none of your groceries looked Indian, beyond the lack of meat. It was very frustrating dating an Indian years ago, with this rule against leaving home.. we were in our late 20s/early 30s, and still she had to live with her parents and brother, even though she earned like triple the household income on her own.

Edit: didn't realize several other people made the same comment. Sorry to be redundant.

Last edit: I could also tell you weren't Indian, because the groceries were in cabinets, rather than piled on the kitchen table and floor and elsewhere. And because it's not all deep-fried spicy snacks. No more stereotypes, I promise."

Especially if you wear glasses and they fog up instantly when the hose comes out. So annoying."
