BasicBulletJournals,fdkwcjl,t1_fdktpxz,1578512512.0,"You are accomplishing work though. Write down what your assignments were? Or maybe you can pickup a little creative hobby? Like doodling, zentangles, creative writing? You already have everything you need to do those. What do you like? I've told my self if I'm bored, then I can learn something. And, it might be because it's winter. The winter blues is a real thing Seasonal Affective Disorder. Or ""senioritis"". I remember senior year being a weird transitional phase that can mess with everything. You can also just skip doing dailies. When I'm in a very non-busy period, I just have a 2 page monthly and write any extra notes in there.
You can also work on your goals and plans for anything you might want to do in the future. Takes a bit of introspection of course.
Sorry, a bit disorganized up there, ADHD is hitting hard rn.  Hope any of that was helpful."
BasicBulletJournals,fdkslr8,t3_elw8or,1578510295.0,"Your daily log doesn't need to be about what you need to do, it can also be about what you did! At the end of the day, or as I go, I will note things I've started or completed so I can look back and see ""yes I did stuff that day!"" (I have a horrible memory) And it helps my self esteem."
bulletjournal,fdks656,t3_elob7z,1578510037.0,Gorgeous! I love the black and white aspect on top of the gorgeous watercoloring.
LifeProTips,fdkkb64,t1_fdjudpj,1578505398.0,"That was my dh first thought as well. Seems like it would have worked, too, without the excellent OP. It's kind of terrifying."
LifeProTips,fdkimeq,t1_fdjjray,1578504562.0,"OMG, all the time!!!!! I'm glad I so saw this. My little guy very suddenly started doing it all the time and I thought it was weird, but he's just being a boy. *sigh*"
spinningyarn,fcz4i0o,t3_ejmpuy,1578093497.0,"Hmm. That's a good question. My best suggestion would be to sample it. Try it out with about an inch of each and wash it and let it set. That's really the only way to know if you'll like it.
I'd probably try it at least two ways as well. One where they are blended before spinning and another where maybe each ply is one type.
Sampling is very helpful!"
Embroidery,fcz43hj,t1_fcwghc8,1578093260.0,Yay!
sewing,fcuz4gu,t1_fcur9p2,1577991399.0,"Thank you.

sewing,fcuq9kp,t1_fculkn4,1577986321.0,"At least you're getting to learn from them though! I missed my chance, she passed away the summer I was going to ask.
Household objects are awesome though! I know a lot of toys, not that my boys play with them, lol."
Embroidery,fcupstr,t1_fcup5rl,1577986066.0,"Cool!!! Oh is it also done on wool or cotton fabric or the regular stuff, or does it matter?"
Embroidery,fculc6o,t3_eizkat,1577983525.0,"Gorgeous!!!! I think using wool and similar is called crewel needlepoint, but I've never gotten clarification. Definitely on my to try list :)"
bulletjournal,fcul5fp,t1_fcuhuks,1577983417.0,Totally!!! It was a massive boost to my self esteem and took the edge off my post partum depression
sewing,fcul1i1,t1_fcuk77a,1577983355.0,"Look pretty perfect to me!!!! But, I can still really only make little zipper pouches and badly done quilts, lol. I would probably have driven my mom crazy since she was a pro at sewing clothes and things. But, she always said done is better than perfect."
quilting,fcuhoda,t3_eiz1ts,1577981202.0,Gorgeous!!!! Love everything about this!!

quilting,fcu5q7a,t1_fcti51g,1577973206.0,"Thank you!!!
I know, right!!! They looked ok when I pieced them, but they look awesome in this quilt. I just wish I could get a picture to show how the violet and burgundy play off each other properly."
quilting,fcu5gzf,t1_fct9cwm,1577973032.0,Thank you!!!!
bulletjournal,fct8fl3,t3_eimopl,1577935638.0,"Love!!! I love the meme!
I agree!! I skipped several weeks last year and NO wasted space makes me soooooo happy!!"
bulletjournal,fct7jfc,t3_eiqhrz,1577934946.0,That is awesome!!!! I love the whole thing!! Don't forget it's a leap year :)
quilting,fct6izb,t3_eis98w,1577934168.0,"Very proud of my swirls! Not even sure why I chose to do them, was originally going for zigzags and somehow started fmq these swirls, lol. And the circles look surprisingly good to me, too!!"
quilting,fct651u,t1_fakdg4k,1577933878.0,Was able to quilt it some more on another machine afterall!!!

BasicBulletJournals,fcslc22,t1_fcsfu1z,1577918949.0,"They are, aren't they! I've been thinking about writing it on a post it and moving it thru my weeklies, then filling the space where the post it was with a Moment of the Week note or something."

AmItheAsshole,fcixuaa,t3_eh8f8j,1577672415.0,"NTA, not even a little bit!!"
bulletjournal,fcfp5jk,t1_fcd1zhe,1577632383.0,"Cool! That's really neat. Usually how things get done around here anyways since I'm constantly having to break up projects due to interruptions. How did you learn? Book, class, YouTube?"
bujo,fcaa3nm,t1_fca8lin,1577565448.0,"I hear that!! And I will totally have plain columns/rows to list my appointments instead of writing out the months, lol."
bulletjournal,fc907j3,t1_fc8ym8t,1577544922.0,Wow! That's so neat!! I forgot how much I liked the look of watercolor till I saw this. Is it hard to do?
bulletjournal,fc6zsjy,t3_eghryf,1577493736.0,"Lol! Brilliant! Never thought of that. Turned out gorgeous, to be sure. Love the font and the florals!!!!"
bulletjournal,fc6xlj7,t3_egd1gu,1577492103.0,Love all 3. 2020 is gorgeous. Is that watercolor?
Handspinning,fc6oysz,t3_egev6k,1577485828.0,"Hackles can give you a longer top than just combs. I prefer just combs, but that's because I prefer to be portable.
Just remember that if you ever get a puncture or scratches from them, to get it treated immediately. There is a lot of nasty stuff that settles on combs, even from clean fiber. Not to mention tetanus."
bujo,fc6oijz,t3_eggrud,1577485504.0,Very nice!!! It looks really helpful!
bujo,fc6mcmo,t1_fc6k77d,1577483976.0,"Cool. I was never good about note taking in school. It really helped when I learned about sketchnoting my last semester and loved it, lol."
bujo,fc6ctlk,t1_fc1kjm6,1577477555.0,"Thank you!!!
That's what I always say too!!
It has been pretty awesome so far!"
