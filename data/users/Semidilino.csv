femalefashionadvice,fedch2l,t1_fedb6bg,1579007546.0,"I do agree with the wrap dress thing! It really mold the body but wrap dresses would be one of the few exceptions to use V-neck, definitely don't work for me in any kind of shirt. 
It Always looks good in square necklines, for example in basic blouses looks beautiful but I only use it with a high waist pants! I believe it is because I have average/ large breasts. Maybe in a dress it wouldn't look good because of my low hips."
femalefashionadvice,febm4kp,t3_eo7o7z,1578960252.0,"Rectangle /Inverted triangle body shape here, narrow hips and short legs compared to my torso, its a hell try to find dresses and skirts that really look good on me, has been years I don't put a skirt tbh. For me, high waist dresses always fit nice, avoid tube dress if your legs are too close and you have shoulders larger than your hips. Would like to hear more tips."
