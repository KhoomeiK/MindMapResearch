This would work perfectly as a digital setup too"
bulletjournal,fdh6qng,t3_eldmye,1578416577.0,"So last year I was kind of in a similar place. I didn't like the thick, dust attracting cover of my new bujo but thought I'd get used to it and it didn't need to be perfect. Spoiler : I couldn't stand it and swapped it out in May.

My simple advice, do what you think will make you happy. Theres no point in feeling stuck with something you can't get behind. For eg, I spill a lot of ink using the fountain pen I use, doesn't bother me(it's fun to doodle around) but a screwed cover I can't handle. 

Find your balance and don't apologize. If you need, recycle your current book. Your bujo is gonna be your best companion and the point is to reduce anxiety. Have a great year journaling."
