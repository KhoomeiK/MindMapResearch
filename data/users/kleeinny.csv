It's still their wedding day. Don't deliberately ruin it just because they're wretched people. Why would you even want to celebrate with such jerks? 

If you and the bride's ex like each other enough to hang out, go do something a heck of a lot more fun than going to the wedding of such an awful woman. I can't get over the two of you being given *rules* for the wedding. Absurd. Go have an adventure instead! Go do something fun. And if you want be a little petty about it, post it all to social media."
