By playing stupid games you win stupid prizes. Especially when he is a man. Men don’t get them hints usually, we’re really oblivious and you might not get what you want in the first place."
fragrance,fejihtf,t3_epdw5k,1579175728.0,"Orange or Brown color of perfumes are imo a warm and spicy scents. Like Armani stronger with you, azzaro wanted by night and paco rabanne 1 million privé. This is based on my brown/orange fragrances, but I think it would fit the description"

fragrance,fdvtfl4,t3_en7hqn,1578751248.0,"It’s a pretty good fragrance, but I prefer by night way much more. To me, the standard wanted feels more casual and than the flanker. Wanted by night is like a date time fragrance, which I also use everyday because I can’t get enough of it."

unpopularopinion,fdp0113,t1_fdowtgc,1578616783.0,"Why, because I think that showing off with smoking pot doesn’t make you cool, but rather cringy? As I said, I don’t mind people smoking this, I tried, not my cup of tea. If you wanna smoke weed, then go ahead. But don’t post this everywhere every time you do it."

unpopularopinion,fdnemgt,t1_fdn9jgn,1578584167.0,"That’s why I’m limiting myself to thoughts like that. Ain’t nothing good coming from turning somebody like that in. It just buggers me to see someone trying to be cool, especially by doing drugs."
unpopularopinion,fdmuc1x,t3_em3xxm,1578566173.0,"Seriously, seeing this one guy showing off on social media that he’s smoking a blunt makes me cringe so much I wanna snitch on him. It wouldn’t be difficult cos he keeps his stash in his car."

fragrance,fdjyfuj,t3_elsnvs,1578491383.0,"Wanted by night and Armani stronger with you intensely are my faves. They fit both for fall and winter. Paco rabanne 1 milion privé is also nice for winter, it projects differently during that time. Every other season, this smells a bit different, which seems really cool to me. Can’t tell anything about Valentino uomo, they don’t have it in Sephora around here and I can’t remember how spicebomb extreme smelled, but it was okay."
fragrance,fcuql95,t1_fcuczo1,1577986502.0,"Present! I’m not really into notes that much, but I really enjoy those warm and sweet fragrances, something spicy or woody comes along too. Also, I’m very keen on more powder-ish kind of vibe too. I dislike ambroxan fragrances, they’re just boring. My favorite fragrances are: one milion and one milion privé, azzaro wanted by night, Gucci made to measure, aventus, Armani stronger with you intense and Armani eau de cedre. And also la Nuit de’l’homme and l’homme, I’ll update if something more comes to mind. I hope this gives you some insight. 


I’m looking forward to see the results!


Forgot about female fragrances, my girlfriend’s fragrances I love are victor and Rolf flower bomb midnight and Armani because it’s you. I don’t know why, but there are a ton of fragrances from Armani I really enjoy"
offmychest,fcp75k5,t1_fcp6n99,1577852708.0,I would just wreck the whole party. Sitting there and just trying not to break all hell loose out of me. I feel like I kinda messed up the mood on the new year party I was at because of my problems.

RedDeadOnline,fce2t7e,t1_fccx8sg,1577616399.0,"These people are bored of this game already, so they discourage others to make them stop playing it too. Everyone that griefs out of boredom deserves to be put in a lobby full of those bastards when being on a mission helping their newbie little friends. I would love to see all those people cuss at each other just because they got a taste of their own medicine. 

A hacker would be fine, you’re on a mission so you either restart the game or deal with it while hacker just runs around lassoing everyone and all you can do is constantly kill yourself, cos you can do jack shit."
fragrance,fc9x7pw,t3_egtd8g,1577559541.0,"I started taking interest into fragrances the moment I realised the crap from the drugstore ain’t gonna cut it if it comes to longevity which was a major factor to me back then. So I took a few samples from notino and there was my first real fragrances that made me interested in this hobby. That was an aventus clone that started it all. Now I’m at the state of finishing off all my “sidearm” fragrances to get a few new ones, like really new experiences."

RedDeadOnline,fc8dmm2,t1_fc7dvmv,1577532544.0,"Yeah, there is something about those high level posses in this game. Every single one of it ruins the game, doesn’t matter if it’s free roam or a showdown of some sort. 


My first experience with rdo right after completing the intro was a high level posse grabbing my ass with a lasso and I was like, yup just like gta online and changed sessions. 


The other time the same kind of posse shot me just because I wanted to help them clear out the ambush. Not only did I get killed but they also stole an animal carcass I had with me. After taking parley they’ve been following me for no reason. Luckily, the carcass stealer was some kind of a half brain retard and crashed his horse on a cart, flying a couple of meters away giving me the time to grab my animal and run away."
