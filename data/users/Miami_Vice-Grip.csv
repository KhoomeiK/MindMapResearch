I was mentioning the equal skill player fights as the best way to observe your new skills actually working as you'd expect them to against what would be a version of your old self, essentially.

Obviously I wouldn't expect every player to find out all the nuance of the game on their own, but that a check in against someone of your level but without the skill you've been taught would give some positive feedback that doesn't require the teacher to ""pretend to be bad"" for the sake of positive reinforcement."
Mordhau,fdose92,t1_fdmezde,1578611823.0,"Indeed. I saw a poor level 20-something go 9 to 40 in frontline last night. That would be a fucking hour and twenty minutes of planking, not to mention the over 1000 movements of the other shit. Fuck."

""When they do moves like that just turn your brain off and LMB""

> ok

""Well not like that, because they'll read you and and counter that. So just be a little brainless and LBM""

etc.

There's also no way to learn additional positive feedback without structure. When you're first learning about good spacing to avoid attacks or force whifs, well, what do you do next? How do you capitalize on advantages?

Things that you'll learn over time are weapon lengths, when and how to duck/matrix, basic footwork, etc. but how to actually use these advantages is not really something you can pick up easily without something deliberately teaching you.

Also, a big tip from me would be if you think you don't know how to drag or accel (or that you're doing it wrong) because your opponent's keep blocking them, it's more likely that they're just hard reading you and you're doing the technique correctly.

In this environment, it's hard to ever find someone of equal skill in a duel server to really practice on, because people can only teach techniques they themselves know well, which also means they know how to counter them."

AskTrumpSupporters,fdik3nt,t1_fdiihik,1578444682.0,"Would you be willing to pay more in taxes if it meant you spending less on whatever you spend your money on normally?

Like, hypothetically, pay an extra $2 dollars in taxes but the cost of a gallon of milk went down by $2 dollars? (replace milk with whatever staple you have regularly)?

Because as I see it, investing in the overall spending power of the citizens, and actually allowing capitol to flow from the top to the bottom, and then get spent, will end up reducing the price for things, or improving the quality of things that can't decrease price.

I'm also not for Yang personally, but the common sense understanding of why a UBI-ish system would improve the economy for everyone seems pretty self-evident to me.

Taxes are irrelevant on their own, and must be directly compared to the cost of living/housing/etc.

You talk about why doesn't he lower taxes by 12k a year, but that doesn't account for people who already do not make enough money to pay that much. I dunno, man. Obsessing about taxes is already kind of weird, the idea of ""keeping what I've earned"" is already a subjective concept. The decision of what labor or w/e is worth isn't some kind of universal constant. We get to define it.
