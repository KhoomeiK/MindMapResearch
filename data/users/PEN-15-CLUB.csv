fatlogic,ffiamrp,t1_ffi3ukj,1579969320.0,Your comment made me decide to check out Cheesecake Factory's nutrition facts and [holy shit](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/assets/pdf/Nutritional_Guide.pdf&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwic4teWk5_nAhXPGM0KHSojAfoQFjAAegQIBhAB&usg=AOvVaw2cng6-uHcHQeYH0RT4rKaO) I can't believe how insanely high calorie like EVERY meal is. And one piece of cake is that much?? I've only been there a couple times and I'm not sure if I have ever gotten dessert there. Is it like a massive slice?
TherapeuticKetamine,fffl5xa,t3_etd1lt,1579886335.0,"Sounds like it's going well for you so far, that's great to hear! I feel like I could have written this, I'm also in my mid-30s and have been trying to figure out this depression thing for a couple decades. I know what you mean that the ketamine makes you feel ""normal"".  I'm a year in and I'm still doing pretty good without any relapses.  I hope you experience the same.

You might really enjoy Tracey Chattaway! I'm always on the hunt for good infusion music and her instrumental piano stuff is soo perfect. (It's all non-vocal)  [Spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7pTS4RiG0sM9TijxQJz8f6)"
loseit,fffk43o,t1_ffer67k,1579885685.0,I just read about a study the other day where they did cognitive tests on people getting various amounts of sleep.. there was even a noticeable difference between people getting 7 hours vs a full 8 hours. It's crazy.
1200isplenty,ffcwmaw,t3_esy9ja,1579808798.0,"These are the ingredients I used but you can add any veggies you want and in smaller or larger amounts. You just have to adjust the amount of broth based on your veggie amount.

**Hearty Veggie Soup with Turkey**

- 1 lb Ground Turkey (93% lean)
- 2 Tbsp Olive Oil
- (2) 14.5 oz cans Diced Tomatoes, undrained
- 5 Garlic Cloves, minced
- 1 Large Onion, chopped
- 1 Head Cauliflower, chopped
- 8 oz Broccoli, chopped
- 1 Red, 1 Yellow, 1 Orange Bell Pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces
- ~8 oz Green Beans, cut into 1-inch pieces
- ~10 oz Carrots, sliced
- 5 oz Baby Spinach
- ~10 cups Chicken Broth (enough broth to *just* cover the veggies in the pot) 
- A SHIT TON of Italian Seasoning (blend of Oregano, Thyme, Basil, Rosemary, Sage, Marjoram)
- Salt to taste
- Pepper to taste


1. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. 
2. Add the onions and turkey. Saute until turkey is browned and onions are translucent. Season and salt the turkey a bit as it's browning.
3. Add carrots and bell peppers.  Continue to saute until carrots are reasonably soft.
4. Add the minced garlic. Saute for about a minute, until fragrant.
5. Add everything else - the cauliflower, broccoli, green beans, diced tomatoes, spinach, broth, and Italian seasoning. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. 
6. Bring the soup to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for one hour.

TherapeuticKetamine,ff6ql36,t1_ff6px3s,1579632816.0,"Yes I really enjoy it. During the infusion there's this feeling that permeates me that is hard to put into words. A feeling like.. knowing everyone is just doing their own thing, trying to survive, trying to be happy. I'm not special; no one is. We're all connected in this crazy world together. Help others and allow yourself to be helped as well.

Basically ketamine is turning me into a Buddhist :D"
EatCheapAndHealthy,ff6q198,t1_ff6f44g,1579632488.0,Any apples that compare to Honey Crisp in crispness and taste? Been eating them a lot recently but they're so damn expensive.
TherapeuticKetamine,ff6pe8c,t3_erwp1d,1579632106.0,"I love your description ""space exploration""! That is exactly how I feel during my infusions. I fly through different worlds that ebb and flow based on the music I'm listening to. My body stops existing and it's similar to lucid dreaming.

My troches are low dose so those just make me a little relaxed and cognitively out of it. But they help my depression which is really the only thing that matters. Thanks for sharing your story!"

starterpacks,fen5r5d,t1_fen4qiv,1579277578.0,"Were you smoking once a day or was it an all day kind of thing? I definitely want to stay away from becoming dependent on it and keep it something I do a few nights a week in the evenings. There was a really good askreddit thread a couple weeks ago like ""What are the negative effects of weed that people don't talk about?"" It gave me a lot to think about.

edit- here it is https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/eh8gs2/what_are_the_downsides_of_weed_that_people_dont/"
starterpacks,fen18sx,t1_femuo3l,1579274707.0,"I've always would have preferred to smoke weed over alcohol but I'm in my 30s and don't know anyone who smokes, no idea where to begin getting it. So I used alcohol as my nightly vice, drinking maybe 5 nights a week about 3 drinks a night. I thought it was moderate enough where it wasn't affecting me negatively the next day. 

But holy shit, it was. I had no idea until Jan 1st when cannabis became legal in IL and I have been smoking weed instead of drinking. I have more energy, performing better at work, depression is better, I'm not TIRED anymore.

I had no idea I've been functioning with a handicap all these years, I thought I was a fairly moderate drinker. I'm so sorry your job is screwing you over. Fuck alcohol. Good on you for being able to stop."
loseit,fegu8s7,t3_ep3ks5,1579102655.0,"You're fine. For weight loss, the actual calorie amount is what matters, not the nutrients in the food. In terms of ""healthy eating"", the sugar in fruit is natural and comes with a lot of fiber. It's good sugar, not the evil overly processed kind."
loseit,fdrrjdt,t1_fdrqz0e,1578688656.0,"Yes, the positive is that it's a very healthy fat! But when I knew nothing about cooking I would just dump a ton of olive oil in the pan when I was sauteing veggies or potatoes or something along those lines. Then I would eat the entire thing. It was probably 500+ calories of oil and I had no idea. Now I cook with way less oil and divide the portions."
loseit,fdrnql3,t3_emvmpv,1578687132.0,This is how I felt a few years ago when I found out that a single tablespoon of olive oil is 120 cal! Also I was embarrassed I didn't already know because it seems to be pretty common knowledge.
loseit,fdrmjjr,t1_fdqrn0g,1578686641.0,Do you have a brand recommendation for cauliflower rice?
TherapeuticKetamine,fdr7df1,t3_emtmyu,1578680540.0,"Does your ketamine clinic have a doctor that could prescribe them or at least provide recommendations?

The doctor at my clinic prescribes them and I would think that would be typical of most clinics but I may be wrong. My clinic calls in the prescription to a local compounding pharmacy who then deliver them to me."
fatlogic,fdnialg,t1_fdn7lg5,1578586389.0,"I read the first 25 pages or so.. he says that overconsumption of calories is the ""proximate"" cause of weight gain. To give an analogy, a plane crash's ""proximate cause"" is gravity pulling it to earth. But the ""ultimate"" cause is something else.. human error, mechanical malfunction, etc. He says it's the same thing with weight gain. Excess calories is the proximate cause, it's the base reason, but there are other things (the ""ultimate"" cause) that are responsible for the excess calorie intake.

I haven't read any further so I'm not exactly sure how he elaborates."
fatlogic,fdkzvjz,t1_fdkt4qw,1578514554.0,And those crazy froufrou coffee drinks are so damn good but so insane. Large ones can be upwards of 1200 calories. Never again
TherapeuticKetamine,fdkgzvz,t3_eluxls,1578503681.0,That's awesome it's working for you! Good luck on your session today.
fatlogic,fdhfom7,t1_fdh1rxb,1578421663.0,Nothing against keto but this is the exact reason it never worked for me but calorie counting does. There's no way I could be disciplined enough to eat low carb as a complete lifestyle change. It ended up being easier for me to just eat less of everything overall.
chicagotrees,fdepbdg,t3_ekxt0j,1578343798.0,"I'm not a first timer but I have smoked maybe 10 times in my life. I'm super introverted with not many friends, I live and work in the suburbs, and I don't know anyone who smokes. I had no idea how to go about getting it illegally so I'm this dork who was really really excited about being able to get weed for the first time.

My experience Jan 1st with zero tolerance - I took 2 small hits off of a Mr. Clean strain preroll, didn't feel much, so I took a 3rd HUGE toke. I stumbled to the couch and didn't move for a bit. Felt like my face was melting for like an hour. I definitely should have waited a bit after those 2 small hits. I know now to take it slow!

Edit with some more details: Lying on the couch I got super horny randomly, like hornier than I've ever experienced lmao. Took care of that. After I was ok enough to get off the couch I decided to take a bath. When I was in the bath I started to get super paranoid that a fire was somehow going to start in the kitchen or in the furnace room and I wouldn't be able to stop it because I was in the bath. So I got out and went back to the couch (to monitor the fire situation of course). Then I got super hungry, ate this delicious pasta dish I had made earlier. It tasted incredible. Watched some Netflix. I still felt kinda stoned when I went to bed like 6 hours later."
