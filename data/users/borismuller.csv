[I also found this report](https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41723.htm) which has numerous examples, including:

>In January, in order to implement a 2000 law requiring that minorities be granted ""appropriate representation"" in the civil service and on the boards of government corporations, Prime Minister Sharon mandated that every state-run company's corporate board must have at least one Arab member by August. In June, the media reported that the number of Arabs sitting on the boards of state corporations actually had declined. According to data from the Government Companies Authority, Arabs were only 36 out of the 544 board members of state-run companies.

...as well as...

>Well educated Arabs often were unable to find jobs commensurate with their level of education. According to Sikkuy, Arab citizens held approximately 60 to 70 of the country's 5,000 university faculty positions."
