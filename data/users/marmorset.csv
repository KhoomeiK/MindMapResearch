I have a player that rolls on his own. The correct response is ""Too bad you wasted that 20, but you're too far away to hear anything. You're going to wish you had that lucky roll back when the demon grapples you.""

Just because a player rolls something does't mean it means something."

I'm answering why religious people tend to support Trump, my mission was not to give evidence that the government is out to get religious people. I'm giving my opinion on why I think Trump gets Christian voters, I didn't comment on myself or my beliefs at all.

I brought up Obama as a contrast to Trump and why Christian voters might feel that Obama opposed their interests. I'm not connecting you to Obama, commenting on your political beliefs, or mentioning you at all. That you think I've done so shows evidence of your own ""incredible persecution complex.""

I've explained the reason it's not hypocrisy for Christians and Orthodox Jews to support Trump. It's not that they endorse him as a person, they believe he's supportive of their interests in general, or at the minimum isn't opposed to them as the Democrats are."

If you're someone whose faith is a defining characteristic in your life, your best bet is to support the people who at least go through the motions and aren't trying to destroy you.

As far as the enthusiasm for Trump, do you forget that children were singing songs praising Obama? That people were viewing him as some sort of spiritual figure and magazine covers had a halo around his head? Politics is now Us vs. Them, the president is more than just the head of the federal government."
