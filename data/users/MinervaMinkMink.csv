SuicideWatch,fdco6po,t3_ekiyeq,1578279805.0,"Racism is not human nature. Neither is war nor the findings of the Milligram system. 

Its a complex relationship between social factors, economics, and politics. For the experiment, its important to consider how we view authority, workmanship, and third part alignment. (aka NOT  human nature) There have been plenty of studies in which things were changed around. There are different results when its a child giving orders, when only women are involved, and even in non hospital-esque settings. The experiment isnt human nature, its human relationships

Sorry if I seem aggressive but claiming things like racism and cruelty is “human nature” always feels like an excuse to do nothing about racism and cruelty. Why actively breakdown those structures when one believes they are innate? That’s just an easy way out of active change and its also just...wrong. None of that is human nature and it should be called what is “socialization and indoctrination.” Then from there you change it. You dont just accept it. Again, dont mean to be aggressive but still"

ADHD,fclghls,t3_ehriz9,1577747237.0,"Some cleaning advice you could share is to take things step by step. Its easier said than done. 

Because when it comes to adhd and cleaning, two things happen. One is that the brain doesn’t register or even “see” a mess until (two) the mess becomes overwhelming. To tackle both things, divide into sections. Instead of “clean the kitchen.” Try 

“Put dirty dishes in sink.” “Turn on water.” “Add soap.” “Scrub.” “Rinse.” And boom dishes are done. 

Then move in to “Wet cleaning rag.” “Use disinfectant if needed.” “Wipe counters.” And then the counters are clean.

The hardest part about cleaning and adhd is starting and avoiding being overwhelmed. Breaking things into parts helps.

Also [schedules like these helped me alot](https://pin.it/yjprxd7ksqwiqb) . Try it and you can even customize it"

academia,fciwqqr,t1_fcir094,1577671657.0,"My post was a mini rant about being destroyed. Nowhere did I say it was just about thesis. I was gas lit for months. And I am trying to move on. That’s what each post is about

And do you know what Dysgraphia is? “Can get by without it” and “not necessary” or 2 different things.

Its not a total sum.

Its more like I am at 40% capacity without it as opposed to a usual 100% with it. Like someone who is deaf can “get by” with lip reading but captions and signage make things easier. Most of my students with wheel chairs can **gasp** walk and they can get by without aid. But not far and not for very long.

I have also been dysgraphic for 24 years, I have adapted and learned how to “get by.” That does not make my aids un needed, but exposes how sad the lack of access and education blocks aid and mobility. I do not think you have a firm grasp of the nuance of disability and aids but yes I can get by. BUT after months of constantly being shut down and trying to agree with your advisor, wouldn’t you try to boost your concentration and power from 40% to 100%? I started stimming because I was growing desperate and that’s when the comments started. And there is also this thing called a “shutdown.” It happens when you are made to stop stimming once it happens and it can be caused from other things.

And I have dealt with assholes just never assholes who blatantly weaponize disabled identities. Its not everyday you get called autistic as an insult. I am black so I can say this, imagine getting called the N word. That’s a different kind of assholery, one I can’t deal with. There is also a lot to this story that I still haven’t shared. I haven’t talked about the response of my peers, the other students who have come through with similar stories, and the growing divide. I haven’t talked about the drafted letters, meetings, email threads, walkouts, etc. I am not leaving solely b/c of this advisor, I’m leaving b/c this is just one of many turmoils that have set the department ablaze. There are also ZERO disability scholars here and its better for me to move on anyway. I need a new  department that will better serve my needs. But still its all sudden and difficult to think past"
academia,fcfrv61,t1_fcf39ii,1577633165.0,"Im sorry but I cant work at all without my devices. Thats like asking someone to walk without thier wheel chair. That’s like asking someone not to wear hearing aids or speak sign language

My point was that however good or beneficial the other might be, if I cannot exist in ways that I need to, then its pointless. I cannot write. At all. How is an advisor going to help when they do not allow me to use computers or recorders?

Again, everything you said was true but what good is it if I am prevented from basic thought. I was 100 percent on board until I was prevented from doing so.

Edit: You seem to think this is all about the thesis. Its not, not any more. I am willing to accept that my thesis is problematic. But I can’t accept not having access to stim or devices. I cant accept being called autistic like its an insult. Everything was fine till i was attacked for my needs. Stop cherry picking the things relevant to work and take in the whole picture. This is outside thesis at this point"

academia,fccd4px,t1_fcbsdd8,1577597031.0,"“Perspective and understanding” won’t help me much when I can’t stim or use my devices. It also won’t help me when I get made fun of for needing to stim and called autistic. Not that autistic is an insult, but still. (Note: I am not autistic) I was with this advisor until I got told multiple times to “stop doing that little dance” and that she’d “met undergrads with more control over themselves.” For reference I have ADHD, extreme dysgraphia, and bipolar disorder.

And yea I can convince people that my topic is worthwhile but after spending an hour explaining basic disability and crip theory, that doesn’t really do anything for my thesis. I seriously spent an hour explaining why dementia is a disability. I spent weeks arguing about disability being a minority identity and not a “deformity.” I also had to validate primary sources written by disabled people. But still, all of that may have been productive if the accusations and the breach of ADA wasn’t so cruel and toxic.

First I thought, like you did, that maybe she had a better perspective. But how good or “better” can that perspective be when she is outwardly ablest? Maybe she does understand “the field” better but I do understand what needs to be done for disability in academia. I was willing to convince my chair to be onboard with my idea, but I cannot and will not convince someone to be onboard with my existence."
academia,fcald15,t1_fcaghaf,1577571513.0,"Sure thing! It’s not a secret and I am fine with people asking. It’s just that the form tends to list accommodations rather than a diagnosis. And you’re right, I have ADHD with extreme dysgraphia. Most would make assumptions about that because they don’t know what it is.

But I am willing to look into direct action. It’s just that I am afraid of future prospects at different PhD programs or even future hiring departments. Don’t want to burn bridges before I cross them but then again, it shouldn’t be to detrimental to my future

academia,fc7r8rv,t1_fc7ph3e,1577516580.0,"Sure. Like I mentioned, she rejected the anything about dementia because “It wasn’t disability. It was natural age progression.” Those are not mutually exclusive

Alot of her suggestions also referred to disabilities as “deformities” and I have never used that word.

I also felt that my chair’s suggestions moved the focus away from disabled people and disabled opinions and focused too much on the role of care takers. This was a bit infantilizing. Contrary to my chair’s belief, taking testimonials and literature from actual disabled people is a viable option. Those with autism can speak. My thesis isn’t trauma porn about *how hard it is to care for the poor helpless disableds*

And honestly, I am willing to work on issues and am very much open to criticism. But “your research un necessary.” “You can’t consider disability a minority identity.” (I can. That’s basic Crip theory) And “You don’t have a thesis or anything that works” isn’t criticism. Its just cruel.

But again, I was definitely willing to at least discuss until the comments about my needs made me uncomfortable. I honestly believe that my chair had good intentions and it was her version of tough love but since that toughness came from ableist assumptions and shut down discussions rather than opening them up, then it was just cruelty. She also said that she “met undergrads with more control over themselves” when I was stimming.

For reference, I draw margins in the margins of my notes while talking. The lack of eye contact bothers people but still...

Its also worth mentioning that I do not have Autism. I am neurodivergent and do not have to disclose my exact diagnosis to faculty. But she never asked so im not sure where that assumption came from"
academia,fc7o1mq,t1_fc7mpxi,1577513968.0,"I hate to out myself on this site but I have nothing to lose. 

I work in the humanities and African American studies. My project is about African American communities and how communal relationships and disenfranchising socio and economic statuses (i.e poverty, education, and health care) effect their approach and interpretation of disability. Basically I argue that disability in black communities is unique because of how communities view thier interpersonal relationships with one another and how these relationships often contrast with “dominant” society. Like black dementia patients are admitted into nursing homes far less than any other minorities as most black families choose to care for them at home and independently. Similarly, the diagnoses of many debilitating disabilities are given to black patients at a slower and later rate than others. Blind and deaf black children are also less likely to learn Braille or speak sign language. (That isn’t to say they don’t learn communication but that is a different story.) My project considers why that is and argues that it is a mix of both poverty driven limitations and black communal relationships that reject most medical mandates.  Aka, disability in poor, black communities are less likely to employ expensive medical/standard intervention and instead often seek care from friends, family, etc. This is b/c there is a lack of funds, lack of resources, and frankly, a distrust in the medical infrastructures as a whole. Ultimately, I hope that this project is 
a way to help the medical and disability community to expand upon thier outreach. I want people to understand that disabilities in black  communities work in a unique way and if we want improvement, we have to meet them where they are at.

I hope that made sense and I hope it wasn’t nonsense. But yea!"
academia,fc7m8pd,t1_fc7kqug,1577512055.0,"I have told my department chair but he said that I am free to contact other resources but if I were to retaliate or build a case, then to “let him know.”

As far as the proposal goes, I was told by my chair to make one but was constantly told the proposal wasn’t good enough. However, I didn’t quite agree with her reasoning or her suggestions. I didnt apply them. I didn’t like the way she talked about disabilities. I spent each meeting with her explaining what disability was and arguing for my right to talk about it. To give an example, I was told to let go of the portion on dementia b/c “that’s not disability. its just natural age progression.” As if the two were mutually exclusive? But I was trying so hard to find some common ground. She didn’t get overtly confrontational till much later and by then, I had spent so much time trying to make things work, that I was desperate to hang on. That was foolish of me. But, frankly, I was naive and knew relatively little about how a big project worked. I have never done something this big before. 

And honestly, I didn’t stim or use recording devices when we first began the project. I can get by without them but if I want to reach “full capacity” then I stim and use devices. So after months of getting nowhere, I started stimming in front of her. I was just trying to focus better. And thats when she truly started harboring animosity and when I decided to leave.

I am in grad school and he asked about that, still, I barely said anything.
