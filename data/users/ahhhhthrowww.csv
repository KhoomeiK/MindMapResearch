lonely,ff5jzow,t1_ff5jws1,1579596497.0,for real though.
lonely,feq5ekr,t3_eqbcgv,1579337865.0,"this is such a big thing for me. like yeah, i’ve been semi friends with a few people but i haven’t actually connected with anyone since late 2018"
SuicideWatch,fefvogm,t3_eowaju,1579066703.0,"Keep holding on. Sometimes not being sure why you feel the way you do, or feeling as if you shouldn’t be feeling the way you are is worse than having a reason. I hope everything looks up for you <3"
lonely,fecw56k,t3_eoe5kq,1578986989.0,i’m so happy for you!
lonely,fe6s6a2,t1_fe6rop5,1578902874.0,"it never feels like it will. that’s what makes things like this so much more important when they happen, because you aren’t expecting it."
lonely,fe6rkm0,t1_fe6r398,1578902055.0,"ay man, it will come. eventually, it always does.


if i knew you irl i’d hug you."
lonely,fe6qyjv,t3_enz872,1578901241.0,Yeah. In early 2019 an acquaintance of mine gave me a hug as he was leaving and it was such a thing for me I wrote about in the notes app lmao

self,fdup3uz,t1_fdunom1,1578736611.0,"okay gotcha. i just looked up some stuff rq to try and match other people’s experiences with mine, and i think it might be it. it sounds very similar. 


thank you for taking the time to comment on here and help me out. i appreciate it."
self,fdumk4j,t1_fdul5qh,1578735333.0,"i’m not sure. i’ve read about that before, but ruled it off simply because i think it kinda ties in with PTSD or DID, and i have not been diagnosed with either.


correct me if i’m wrong on that though, cuz i don’t really know"
SuicideWatch,fdne46j,t3_ema1ll,1578583853.0,"hey. i switch between a similar thing. some days i fear going to hell but some days i don’t card. regardless, i hope that things for you improve. money will come and go, i think a lot of people face a time in their lives we’re it’s like “how the fuck am i supposed to overcome this one?” the cool part is, they always do. so even though i sound cliche you can overcome this one"
SuicideWatch,fdmsibl,t3_em6nn3,1578563603.0,"if you have the courage to put yourself out there and be rejected, you’re actually badass. like that shit is hard, and i get getting turned down in whatever situation it may be is rough but i promise you one day you won’t be turned down. and that will feel awesome. 

and if you’re feeling humiliated, try to think back to a point where someone you were around humiliated themselves. idk about you but i can never remember a time someone else embarrassed themselves and chances are people won’t remember when you do."
SuicideWatch,fdmrlt5,t3_em78jy,1578562329.0,"not gonna try to give you some magically solution to everything, i don’t have one. but i do truly hope you don’t do it, if that does anything. you were happy before, you can be again. life and shit. it can feel like the end but not be. 

this is gonna sound weird, but i’ll remember you my guy"
SuicideWatch,fdje92i,t1_fdje46a,1578467162.0,"i should have been more clear, im not christian. my family is. my dad’s a pastor, i attend a christian school and have to attend church and youth group per my parents demand."
SuicideWatch,fdceual,t3_eki2s0,1578273166.0,all the damn time. i have playlists with sad songs about specific things to make me sadder depending on how i feel.
SuicideWatch,fctwl15,t1_fctvsdu,1577963230.0,"rehearsal for a musical.

thank you, but also i’m being hypersensitive. i’ve cried/almost cried in front of people more times in the past 6 months than i have my entire life."
SuicideWatch,fctuscy,t3_eivh5m,1577960617.0,"hey, i’m in the same boat. constantly feeling generally disliked as a person? feel that shit.

trust me i understand how overwhelming it gets, and i probably can’t help you but i can tell your it’s unlikely you’re hated by everyone or even most people you meet. your head is lying to you, and i know it’s difficult to break from but it’s simply not true. and it may be hard to see it but there are people who enjoy your presence, maybe they’re just not good at showing it or maybe your thoughts are clouding your judgement, it’s hard to tell"
SuicideWatch,fctul5y,t3_eivlje,1577960318.0,"fellow poor person here.
 
i know it may feel like it, but it’s not your fault. the fact that you’re looking for a job whilst being in school for medicine shows you’re a hard worker. i admite that. i don’t know how much help i can be for you, but i hope things improve for you and your mother."
SuicideWatch,fctubg6,t3_eivw3t,1577959920.0,"if i knew you irl i would give you a hug.
