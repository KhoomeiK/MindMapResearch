Even in the ultra-pass happy Big 12, he showed how much talent he had, and was a critical piece to the 12-1 2011 Oklahoma St team that won the Big 12 for the first time ever. 

The Jags coming off out of 2011 were in desperate need of good pass catchers on their offense. MJD was basically their entire offense that season and needed to add weapons to help young Blaine Gabbert, who was just coming off his rookie season himself. Their top WRs after 11 were Mike Thomas and Jason Hill(and TE Mercedes Lewis led in yards in 2011 at 480) so help was needed. 

In comes Blackmon, who while had some issues before the draft(I know my team spied on him in bars in Stillwater to see how often he went), but he was a potential stud of huge order, at a position that the Jags desperatly needed. Could've they have waited until 7? Probably.
