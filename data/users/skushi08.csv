baseball,ff8x0od,t1_ff87w00,1579698859.0,"Grew up outside NY during the 90s so have always been a Yankee/Jeter fan. Moved to Houston about a decade ago when they were terrible and in the National league. I loved watching baseball so I occasionally just picked up cheap tickets to watch the games. I grew to love them since I figured they were bad and would likely never have to face the Yankees in the post season, at least not frequently. They were my adopted team. Altuve was a gritty hard working up and comer that I had so much respect for. When we had our son he was such a huge Altuve fan. For some reason any time he sees a picture of him, Correa or Gerrit Cole he just shouts their name in excitement. This whole fiasco has just left me mad at them. I feel betrayed for cheering their rise to the top after Harvey hit the city."

I’ve had them restored fully when I wore through the soles, but other than that they looked fine from the top."

They last longer than typical shoes even if you don’t rotate them, and they’re comfy as hell compared to anything that’s not a sneaker. The restoration service really is magic if you wear them out. They look brand new again for like a hundred bucks. I’ve got a pair of cordovans that are my daily drivers. One day a week I’ll rotate in a pair of black factory seconds. Key is to pick up during sales and good seconds finds. Plus if you buy conservative styles that will stay in style forever you’re good to go. 

I’ve only owned three pairs and two lasted my the past 10 years of my professional working career. For a brief window I wore a pair from their travel series, but those are comparatively crap."
politics,ff6s1vn,t1_ff6rj5u,1579633692.0,The rest of their time for opening statement was reserved for rebuttal. 50 minutes of “yes well that was bullshit will get old fast.” Curious if they even bother using full time if they think they have the votes. More time spent talking just makes them look even more absurd. I think Republicans just want to hurry up and vote.

politics,ff680my,t1_ff5t917,1579621311.0,"I think examples like this are a good case for campaign reform. Campaign and election seasons should be limited like they are in many countries. Not like the US where after one election is done folks start declaring their intent to run in the next. 

Campaign reform shouldn’t need to just be limited to money and financing. I want it to also protect the collective sanity of the entire population subjected to one continuous campaign and election cycle/loop."

At least where I am in the US many completely disregard all traffic signs and lights when they’re required to follow all the same motor vehicle laws as drivers. Since I also like cycling with my family I hate it more because they’re the ones that cause drivers to be irrationally mad at everyone else on a bike. 

Side note, I love that your crossing guards are called lollipop men. Crossing guards are some of the most genuinely caring people I’ve come across so for some reason that name suits them. They’re always waving here with a smile on their face. Growing up one of ours in my small town was hit and killed by a distracted driver. I think just about everyone that had grown up there came for the service because they all grew up waving and saying hi in the morning."

Family in need of good education and healthcare options isn’t conducive to that lifestyle. If you’re single with no ties or plans to ever have a family then by all means it could work. You also have to consider the fact if anything goes wrong you’re screwed. It’s not like when you’re in your 50s or 60s you’re coming back to the west doing anything other than minimum wage labor. If you’re ok without any contingency plan then by all means have at. You have to be a very specific type of person for this to work effectively.

Not that I don’t believe you, but do you have any sources to back up that claim? Don’t many countries with M4A also regulate prices? That seems like the only way to prevent runaway profiteering and cost increases to the programs. If it’s regulated then that cost of doing business can’t be passed on to the healthcare system. Can a drug company just decide to pull out of “non-profitable” countries? Then you’d only have access to generic drugs and equipment with expired patents?"
politics,feghu3g,t1_fefuph7,1579093225.0,"I will likely not save money. I have a great employer subsidized plan and the premiums for my family and my out of pocket maximum on the year amounts to less than what my likely tax increase will be. They’d have to keep the tax increase under 2.5% to manage that. Then unless the savings my employer realizes translates over to salary raises, there’s very little chance it’s a net positive for me or most folks I work with. My hope is that it were to be combined with cost reform and regulated pricing at the same time, because that’s really what causes runaway cost increases. 

However, universal healthcare is necessary. Too many people are suffering not going to a doctor because they can’t even afford to let their healthcare, if they have it at all, kick in. That means there’s many people that have never even considered preventative care. I have come to the conclusion that anyone that’s not for it, either doesn’t understand it or is evil."

I agree that option should be on the table, but he didn’t even say anything to his ex about it until after he executed it. I would have been fully not the asshole if he had mentioned the nuclear option as a means of getting the mother to come around to understanding his perspective. That’s why I’m an ESH. Some people suck more than others in the story, but OP still sucks a bit for how he executed the nuclear option, not that he executed the nuclear option."

CFB,fcvpzjl,t1_fcvpn9v,1578007484.0,World star the way this beat down is going.
CFB,fcvp74r,t1_fcvozf4,1578006980.0,Jeff Hafley the co-defensive coordinator for Ohio State. Hopefully he doesn’t have some sort of exit clause if he’s watching this right now.
CFB,fcvoip2,t1_fcvoedb,1578006556.0,To be fair there is a very slim chance the folks in the studio were actually watching that mess.
