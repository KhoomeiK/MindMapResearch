bipolar,ffji9jx,t1_ffji3y3,1579998813.0,Again I haven’t been a commercial pilot for 20 years and don’t know what the current medical regulations are. I definitely would check
bipolar,ffjh13o,t1_ffjga7u,1579998062.0,At least in three weeks when I’m having a bad day I can look back at this post…
bipolar,ffjgwov,t1_ffjgsga,1579997993.0,Well I got out almost 20 years ago so definitely do some research. It would be nice to think that they are getting a little bit smarter about mental health.
bipolar,ffjg3t3,t1_ffjfv77,1579997521.0,The FAA does not allow the issuance of a first class medical if you are taking these types of medication. That is required to be an airline transport pilot
bipolar,ffj9a49,t1_ffj8u5k,1579993459.0,Thanks so much. I think the design part of the business is as much fun as building things
bipolar,ffisy0h,t1_ffis548,1579981926.0,"It took me a long realize that I just simply can’t count on other people. They understand that I struggle but they just don’t understand what we all go through on a daily basis. I’ve been in relationships since I was 14 and I’ve taken the last four years to just work on myself, being a great father to my three kids and building my business. The biggest change that I’ve made in the last year is learning that it’s OK if I need to take a day for myself. Congrats on getting back to school and don’t look back but keep looking forward even if it’s only one week at a time"
bipolar,ffid6w8,t3_ett0gh,1579971069.0,"Also, my daughter was diagnosed in her junior year of college as BP1 so setting a good example has taken on a whole new meaning"
bipolar,fficfw0,t3_ett0gh,1579970558.0,"I was diagnosed BP2 17 years ago and it ended my career as a professional aviator. I still think it was the best thing that ever happened. Six months after being diagnosed, I bought about $300 worth of tools and a Black & Decker “how to build a deck book”. 40+ custom homes and over 100 remodels since then and my number one skill is the creativity that being biopolar brings to me. The depression sucks. The money management sucks. I’ve truly learned though that if I don’t feed my creative side, the depression takes over. It’s been a struggle and I’ve almost gone bankrupt a couple of times but I now have almost a one year waiting list for projects and I just get up and grind every day. Things seldom go from the original plan but my clients understand that’s just how my brain works and they’re beyond happy. This is a video of our most recent home which for added pressure was for a family member.  So for all of you out there just try to do what makes you a little bit happy and remember you’re not alone…"
Tile,ff8p41f,t3_es5762,1579689866.0,We generally use one of the Schluter metal edge profiles around niches/benches/shower edges when using slate. Past results with trying to edge slate led to the tiles flaking
Tile,ff6nd1v,t3_erw083,1579630880.0,I would agree with the mastic. We use Mapei premium mortar stone and tile. I guess mainly we do that for a convenience factor but we only use this product for backsplash work.
aww,ff0aci3,t3_equ135,1579466883.0,The increasing level of assertiveness is awesome.
Blowjobs,felh323,t3_epqem2,1579222012.0,"It’s not that I’m so proud of my now wife, but even more proud of my three sisters in the background cheering on my at that time future wife. I thought it was weird that right after the wedding she wanted me to install the stripper pole but hey if I get this every night, I’m OK with that…"

ConstructionFails,fdx6czx,t3_en16kk,1578765757.0,Master trim guy and I get paid by the cut… Don’t ask questions
Tile,fdx63ao,t1_fdtng16,1578765662.0,Completely agree that centering the joint would make a dramatic improvement. I would consider pulling out those 12 tiles and redoing those to make it look right instead of applying a whole pile of grout in the corner. There is zero chance I would except this shower for one of my homes
