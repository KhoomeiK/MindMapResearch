u_wizj619,fegu53u,t3_ep3bzq,1579102591.0,I’m not impressed with DD3 rewards. The cost vs reward is getting closer to desirable but is still short of “wanting” or even “must accomplish” status compared to DD2

MarvelStrikeForce,fecdjer,t1_fecctta,1578971362.0,"The average gold pull is 160k per gold orb which isn’t even enough to level up a character ONE FREAKING LEVEL past 70. Think about that...

Even crazier, is now the superior uniques can come in groups of 3 for 216k gold which requires TWO gold orbs assuming the minimum is pulled (which it almost always is).

The side drops need a 50% increase and the middle column needs to be 100k at the BARE minimum. 

I’ve grown tired of the NEED for these posts. The game needs a reward redesign on ALL levels. We are no longer playing a game at level cap 60 with 75 characters."
