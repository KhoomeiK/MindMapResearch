>In 1996, the governments -of the United States and Iran reached a settlement at the International Court of Justice which included the statement ""...the United States recognized the aerial incident of 3 July 1988 as a terrible human tragedy and expressed deep regret over the loss of lives caused by the incident...""[12] As part of the settlement, even though the U.S. government did not admit legal liability or formally apologize to Iran, it still agreed to pay US$61.8 million on an ex gratia basis, amounting to $213,103.45 per passenger, in compensation to the families of the Iranian victims.[13]



>The U.S. government issued notes of regret for the loss of human lives, but never formally apologized or acknowledged wrongdoing.[13] George H. W. Bush, the vice president of the United States at the time commented on a separate occasion, speaking to a group of Republican ethnic leaders (7 August 1988): ""I will never apologize for the United States – I don't care what the facts are... I'm not an apologize-for-America kind of guy."" The quote, although unrelated to the downing of the Iranian air liner, has been attributed as such.[57][58][59]

You mean committing a crime to sneak your non-immunized kid into school without going through the actual legal process is 'just like that'? 

Shit, I can't imagine what it looks like to be someone who actually doesn't fucking treat their kid right, in your mind. How does that even look?

You need Jesus and I'm not even religious. Guidance? The parent needs to be put in jail and the kid taken from them for putting everyone else at risk including their kid. Fuck that."

Edit: Your edit makes me laugh. Please tell us who was so *wildly uncivil* that you felt that they ""fought"" you and that you ""should have known""? I just read all the comments and I can't see any that are so bad you have to play the victim card. 

You don't stick to the truth and expound on it - and get pissy when called out. That's pretty hilarious."
television,fcbxu21,t1_fcawksl,1577592179.0,"Shrug - are you saying that Steam and Spotify are ""DRM""? 

If so, you're ridiculous. Period full stop. The idea that any sort of content protection is anathema to people is insulting to content creators and ridiculous. 

If not, I think your point is super unclear."

That's a recipe for being walked all over. ""If someone asks nice and you don't, you're a twat!"" ... like no. Just no."
Mechwarrior5,fc8xdr1,t1_fc8jp8a,1577543600.0,"Yep, but it also causes them to switch targets even inside LRM range. LRM-5 on that GHR? It'll go punk whatever player 2 TAGs :) It works well for us to have both of us able to prioritize targets. Needs lots of comms between each other though."

Awesome gaming bro! Hope y'all enjoyed."

Mechwarrior5,fc6y1qm,t1_fc69t2w,1577492437.0,"So TAG is a Laser you put in a mech (small slot, iirc, 1 ton) that makes missiles lock on faster and ""improves spread"". 

If a co-op non-host player (player 2-4) has TAG on their mech, and points it at an enemy  - any LRM equipped AI will start targetting that mech as if player 1 did F1-F1 :)"

It's showing weapon readiness, not heat at all."

And yet these always seem to be the ""i need the mwo mechlab"" try-hards.

I think people are just poisoned by the bs toxicity here. It's almost as bad as outreach at this point..."

You ignore all the actual coherent and clear arguments and just go ""but muh lore"" like some sort of preteen angsty edgelord.

Ummm point of order... You can turn throttle decay off in the settings. Then it functions like any other throttle based game where W increases the throttle and S decreases it."
