The owners can pay up until the winner of an auction hands the facility cash. So if someone has been through your stuff it’s a legal problem. Storage facilities at least in Florida can only keep money that’s owed to them. So if a person owes $500 and the unit sells for $800 the storage facility is supposed to mail them a check of $300. 

Now of course I’m sure there are some shady practices and obviously storage wars is staged to an extent. But there are laws storage places are supposed to abide by."
