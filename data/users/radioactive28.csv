explainlikeimfive,fevqhcv,t3_eqji5z,1579400279.0,"Many replies have touched on the CPU and supporting hardware, so I'll try a different perspective.

Everything only works because a very tight sequence/order of events is mandated. When power is applied, all components receive their share in some order, and some trigger the start-up of other components.

Most of the sequencing, transfers and handovers early in the cycle are handled by firmware, which is basically software embedded in the hardware (contrast this to software sitting on a harddrive).

One important part in the old MBR scheme is the loading of the boot sector on the harddrive. This sector must contain a tiny programme (bootloader) that can tell the CPU how to locate and launch the OS, which is located elsewhere on the harddrive or even some other device.

The OS is usually then responsible for subsequent operations. Its logic must cover the loading and unloading of applications and drivers, some of which are lower-level and critical to the operation of higher-level applications. Drivers are small modules responsible for fetching data to/from devices so that the OS can receive/present the data to the CPU via the hardware path of the system.

The data presented to the CPU is very specific. The CPU has multiple inputs, some of which are application data, some tell the CPU where to look next (pointers), or what operation to perform next (instructions). In addition to the application logic (games, video playback, etc), every programme (including the OS itself) will contain some amount of logic to prime the CPU and to keep the data flowing."

askscience,fdzymtf,t3_emyqgy,1578798981.0,"No, unless you meant to re-encode the data or somehow process it, simply transferring them over the Internet or other medium will not cause degradation. (There are services that re-encode your audio or video files though, like YouTube, in the interest of saving space/data and ensuring a consistent format.)

There are algorithms that can summarise the entire file rapidly into a signature called a checksum. If even a single bit changes in the file, the checksum changes radically, so it is used to ensure the data integrity of a file. Between the two ends of the file transfer, the checksum is communicated to ensure that the file has been copied identically. If the checksums don't match, the programme/protocol can attempt to re-transmit the file in part or in full, until it is identical. No data loss occurs if this process is carried out for every transfer.

The media holding your digital data can degrade just like media of old though. There are natural variations in the reading and writing signals when accessing the media. The individual memory cells of the media can lose integrity or spontaneously change due to radiation, thereby corrupting the file. But these errors are relatively rare if the whole system has been designed correctly, e.g., through specifications of electrical tolerances, shielding from interference, good QC during manufacturing, etc. If unintended errors do occur, checksums can help highlight the corruption and in some cases even provide some degree of error correction."

explainlikeimfive,fdnhhgj,t3_emaj2z,1578585907.0,"Your phone doesn't really run multiple apps, at least not in the same way Windows runs multiple applications.

You typically only have one *user* app active on your phone screen while many others can be in the background. The background apps go dormant (using minimal CPU time), although they still retain their allocated memory. If Android detects that memory is running low, those apps in the background can be terminated, freeing their memory. Such a move is tolerated because multi-tasking in the desktop sense isn't expected on a mobile device. You can't see them on the screen, so they're not expected to be running or doing work. (System stuff and services are an exception - they always have priority.)

Windows, on the other hand, has to keep all applications running. It has no freedom to selectively kill off some applications - the user can start *x* number of applications and Windows has to assume they are all equally important since they are all visible to the user and could very well be in use. Imagine you're zipping files and seeding torrents in the background while watching a video, and you find a corrupted zip archive later because the archiver was killed midway. (You could even start 50 intensive applications that do not have visible windows and you'd still be expecting them to work simultaneously - this is what happens on server machines.)

So what Windows has to do is juggle all applications equally, even if that means every one of them ends up performing equally poorly.

EDIT: This is just for why applications slow down or freeze. Crashes are due to something else, but the gist is that mobile OSes are newer technology, while traditional desktop/server OSes are older technology.

It's technically not the same chemical, allowing companies to say that their products are BPA-free. The problem is, there's less available historical (consumption-related) safety data on BPS - BPA has decades of safety research behind it - so it cannot be conclusively branded as unsafe.

But if BPS is close enough to share all the same useful properties as BPA, it's likely to also share all the undesirable ones. There are already scientific as well as news reports trying to bring attention to the potential dangers of BPA alternatives, because researchers who studied BPA know that most of the bisphenol analogues (derivatives or siblings of BPA, like BPS) are chemically similar enough to cause the same harmful effects.

It's just that most existing environment and food safety regulations are not nimble/flexible enough to ban all analogues when one chemical is found to be harmful.

askscience,fc1tr1f,t1_fc1l6uo,1577329447.0,"I'm not sure about how granular the neurons are when doing frequency-processing, but if you consider a giant parallel network with, say, 20,000 neuron/regions, each processing a single integral frequency simultaneously, it seems plausible to me that the neurons doesn't need a clock rate to match the sampling rate of the input wave.

The brain also doesn't process all 20,000 outputs equally, and we know this because MP3 encoding algorithms can get away with lower bitrates by using known psychoacoustic properties like masking.

> For example let's say that I listen to a few second long clip from a song. Throughout the clip there's a range of frequencies playing continuously and they all change. So initially there's a peak at say 1000Hz, and then that rapidly moves to 2000Hz, then down to 500Hz, etc. Also while this happens there's also another part (not the peak though) that goes from 500Hz to 600Hz back to 500Hz. Initially the neurons that represent 1000Hz will be activated, and the 500Hz ones a bit, then a very short period of time later, the 2000Hz ones and 600Hz ones, then another short period later the 500Hz ones.

I think the key here is, how fast are those changes, and how fast do you think you're perceiving those changes? Even if the ear and its time-to-frequency domain transform mechanism already gives you perfect frequency information, you will ultimately be limited by perception, which is probably where the speed of the neurons come into the picture. There's research showing that our perception is not continuous, but instead relies on gap-filling tricks to give us a sense that things are flowing continuously."
explainlikeimfive,fby2dv9,t3_ef31nj,1577206427.0,"It really depends on what sort of signage or material you're referring to.

Japanese signage can be shorter than equivalent English ones if they use kanji, but not only because they are ideographs. They can drop some characters for common long words in specific contexts without causing confusion.

But that said, they use katakana a lot for borrowed words of foreign origin, and since katakana approximates the pronunciation of the original word, they may not be shorter than the original word/content. This is because katakana usually approximates one syllable per character. 

Usage manuals though, aren't actually much shorter, if at all. After including all the grammatical particles (similar to English prepositions), the savings really only come from kanji being able to express some ideas more compactly. In a manual for newer technology, you may find more katakana (borrowed words), which doesn't save all that much space."
