bipolar,ffk6fso,t3_ets7y0,1580017412.0,1 gram should be fine if you’re on meds. If not you may get manic. This is personal experience.

headphones,ffjymnr,t1_ffjxu6q,1580010555.0,Happy listening!
headphones,ffjxap4,t1_ffjwlts,1580009499.0,"Yeah they’re pretty amazing. I have that itch to listen to other things, we all know how that goes. I’m planning on possibly going to Colorado for RMAF and doing a tour of headphones/iems there.

Some said the new Schiit amp added more bass but there’s an issue with clipping and distortion on high bass tracks. 

I hated the Hugo 2. IMO it sounds the exact same as my gigabyte Auros motherboard amp/dac. Now that I think about it it might be why I didn’t enjoy the Utopias all that much. I would highly recommend the RME ADI-2. Or if you want to venture into tubes something from Schiit."

headphones,ffjvt62,t1_ffjtxxf,1580008327.0,"I’ve owned the LCD 4. I sold them for the D8000. I was looking into getting the SR1a last month until I read the reviews on how the bass performed. It still interests me but I don’t know if I’ll ever own one, I’ll have to audition to be sure.

I got the Rag because it doubles as a speaker amp for my Buchardt S400 and a balanced headphone amp. Pretty overkill for my headphones tbh but I like the way it looks. It sounds great too. The RME headphone out sounds phenomenal as well. I was running off of a WA8 for a while but I wanted a solid state option and now I only listen to my RME"
headphones,ffjss7m,t1_ffjs6vy,1580005964.0,"The T1s were my first hifi pair and I gave them to my mother. Since then I’ve owned the Meze empyrean (boring/too warm) the Focal Utopia (small soundstage, great imaging, no emotion what so ever) the LCD 4 (FAT bass that can be bloated, very warm, terrible fit, fatiguing on the neck) and my D8000 that will stay for a long time (brighter/not as warm as the LCD 4 and with more detail. Still has a fat bass and sub bass but it doesn’t feel as ‘round’ as the LCD 4. There is one issue that’s apparently fixed with the Pro model and on certain SUPER bassey tracks there is some audible distortion at high volumes)"
headphones,ffjrfm2,t1_ffjr301,1580004971.0,They are the best thing I have heard. I have not heard the abyss yet though.
headphones,ffjqnsl,t1_ffjqg1f,1580004459.0,"When I was looking at TOTL cans I was really interested in the abyss but the weight, style and comfort really threw me off. There’s some threads of head fi that compare the two sound signature wise and you can read up on those but the best thing as we all know would be to audition them for yourself."

bipolar,ffjngvn,t3_etxu3c,1580002321.0,It’s possible but it’s hard. Just be mindful of how you are. That’s really the only advice I have and it’s hard to even decipher what you’re feeling half the time because you get so lost in your emotions. But letting your emotions get the best of you is the pathway to the dark side.
