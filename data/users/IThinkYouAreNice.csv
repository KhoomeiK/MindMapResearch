Catholicism,ffnfqce,t1_ffn2k7j,1580065348.0,Very helpful. Thank you!
Dreams,ffgcf9g,t1_fffvw2t,1579903146.0,I was thinking it might have something to do with my relationship as well.
Catholicism,ffacet8,t1_ffa37fl,1579732242.0,Thanks. I suppose you’re right. I don’t know. I want out of my marriage at least for a while but I can’t because i am dependent on my wife. I’m such a loser.
Catholicism,ffac8oz,t1_ffa3n1o,1579732125.0,"Thanks. But I just don’t change. I try. I really do. But I am just so lazy! I’m still unemployed AGAIN! My wife supports me. I don’t want that! I am so slow and slothful! Maybe I can’t help it and suffer from some sort of mental deficit which would not surprise me or anyone else who has ever known me. And if that’s the case, no amount of prayer will change that."
Catholicism,ffa2jin,t1_ffa18qp,1579726599.0,Been trying. Believe me. Even prayed my first novena. Still the same slothful sinful self.  But I’m too cowardly to even do something about it. And that really is pathetic.
