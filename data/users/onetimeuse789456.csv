baseball,fekr8nj,t1_fekq6sq,1579205947.0,"Hmmmm, the MLB is already aware of this buzzer thing, sure.

But if after the immunity was given, the players were still hiding/lying about this, then that's enough to void the deal since the players were still not telling the truth, and in effect, still lying about it. Unusually immunity deals are conditional on telling the truth.

I'd be surprised if the MLB already knows, since imo, if you can't ban/suspend the players involved, then I'd revoke the WS from the Astros, but that's just me I suppose..."

war,fcxouq5,t3_ejfe6w,1578068012.0,"My take from someone who has a degree in International Relations (not a Middle East specialist, but I still have interest in the region):

Chances of WW3 from this are essentially zero. I'd still consider chances of a direct war with Iran relatively slim. I think Iran knows that they cannot win a conventional war, so any retaliation will likely be unconventional in nature (most likely militia/terror attacks on US bases in the Middle East), but the retaliation could happen weeks from now.

I think the only course of action that would lead to a large scale, conventional war with Iran would be Iran responding with missile attacks against US or allied bases in the Middle East. I think such a response would be met with massive air/missile strikes from the US targeting Iranian airbases and missile sites.

EDIT: And the chances that would would hit mainland US are absolutely zero. We aren't even sure if Iran has a missile capable of reaching the Eastern Coast of the US - that is - if it doesn't get shut down first."

todayilearned,fcj10mu,t1_fciuutx,1577674600.0,"No, that is a huge leap in logic and you know it. The title is called ""The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth"". This suggests that it's main purpose was to look at the moral teachings of Jesus. 

Maybe Jefferson cared for some other stuff outside the Gospels, maybe he didn't, but it is silly to conclude that based on the fact that this particular collection was limited to the Gospels.

If I wrote a book titled ""The Evil Acts of Voldemort"", that does not mean I don't think anyone else did anything wrong in the Harry Potter books."
