RedPillWomen,ffeas4f,t1_ffcow1r,1579841519.0,It sounds like this should be the first step before moving on with what others have suggested.
conservatives,ffe6ujp,t1_ffdvk56,1579838263.0,The younger generation is not entitely lost either. (Gen Z)
ShitPoliticsSays,ffe5xei,t1_ffdq3jw,1579837554.0,"Nope, they're staples in most Slavic countries. My Polish mom brings them up when I ask what her traditional food is."
fatpeoplestories,ffe5jqt,t1_ffdxef2,1579837265.0,"I mean this is a scientific thing not my opinion.

This is getting a bit TMI, but you have qualms about the hair and not the area you're putting your mouth on lmao? There's gonna be particles of that regardless of how well you clean it."
BingeEatingDisorder,ffduu9m,t3_esw2zz,1579829485.0,"You only let those guys win when you take it out on yourself. I know it's hard sometimes, but you have the strength to get through it. I don't know the situation obviously, but is it possible they weren't doing it in the way that you'd think? It's very easy to get into a mindset that people must be talking about you or laughing at you when you're insecure, I've felt like that for most of my life.

Forget those guys, either way. You're improving yourself and they're being immature. You win."
KotakuInAction,ffdiafv,t1_ffd8sz6,1579821452.0,Pride? Like everyone else? Pride of your ancestors' accomplishments and such.
ShitPoliticsSays,ffdhgpu,t1_ffd8ejo,1579820952.0,"I'm pretty sure he's always talked like that, though. Just because you don't like the way he talks doesn't mean he's mentally unwell. The man is 70 something as well."
TumblrInAction,ffdbdxp,t1_ffd8v58,1579817241.0,"Which is why the standard should be the same. There are weaker men just like women are usually weaker. If she's up to snuff despite a biological disadvantage, I don't see a problem."
fatpeoplestories,ffdayrb,t1_ffd8e1x,1579816959.0,"Why can't it just be hard to shave the nether regions in general? I don't expect either sex to shave things that are uncomfortable for them. We definitely have things to shave around, and it's far from flat. I could argue that they're harder things to shave around too, and much easier to nick areas with more nerves. Girls have butts and areas between the two as well, no points for that. You're conflating being hairless with being clean, when hair biologically keeps you cleaner so your areas don't become bacteria pits."
TumblrInAction,ffd4l7c,t1_ffd496k,1579813304.0,"That's what musculature means, yes."
TumblrInAction,ffd4idi,t1_ffd3w12,1579813260.0,"And of course you'd be wrong. In biology, it is contested whether there is even a difference between a male and female brain to a notable degree. Having a mental disorder does not make you any less of a male physically. This isn't some opinion, it's the way that it is. A female has a specific definition that this person does not meet."
TumblrInAction,ffd45dx,t1_ffd3qbj,1579813060.0,"Male bone structure and musculature does not diminish to the level of a female's after developing in the womb and undergoing puberty, sorry. It doesn't apathy to a degree that makes any kind of competition fair."
