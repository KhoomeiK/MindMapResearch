PokemonSwordAndShield,fdtbn4z,t1_fdtb0hi,1578714473.0,I saw the post on /r/popular and was amazed at how stupid it was. That’s it. I abandoned the franchise a long time ago when it was apparent they cared more about selling plushies than they do about making a good game. I was just baffled by the sheer idiocy of the post. What’s *really* a waste of my time is the conversation we’re having right now though. That’s the one I’m confused about tbh
PokemonSwordAndShield,fdta04t,t1_fdt9rdc,1578713864.0,Dude I don’t give a flying fuck what you have to say. I don’t care what anyone in this sub thinks. You’re the only one perpetuating this conversation right now. Why are you still talking to me?
PokemonSwordAndShield,fdt80rl,t1_fdt6c53,1578713123.0,Someone comes at me I’m coming back at them. Simple as that. They’re the ones that attacked me instead of the game. And I don’t give a shit if I’m downvoted.
witcher,fdt55vk,t1_fdrldyy,1578712053.0,"In the game you can find another Djinn and break the bond, and choose whether you still love each other or not. So in at least one timeline it’s not because of Djinn magic"
PokemonSwordAndShield,fdt3hhx,t1_fdt2smr,1578711430.0,"Yup. That’s how I know how it feels, and that’s why I want it to happen to him. 

Good job snooping through my comment history though. Really showed me the things I said! You can get cancer too. I hope your death is quick though, because I doubt anyone loves you enough to care about your suffering."
PokemonSwordAndShield,fdt1u5l,t1_fdt00h1,1578710824.0,"Hey, suck my fucking dick buddy. Keep sucking GFs dick as they fuck you over. I don’t fucking care. Everything you said was completely fucking stupid though, but you don’t care because you’ll get upvoted lol so there’s no point in even talking to you. Good bye. I hope you get cancer and your family watches as you slowly die in front of them."
PokemonSwordAndShield,fdt06iv,t1_fdsz08q,1578710221.0,Crazy that people want at least the same amount of content that they got fucking 8 years ago for 2/3rds of the price and no DLC huh?
PokemonSwordAndShield,fdsyh8r,t1_fdsxvsi,1578709586.0,"I don’t follow the logic on this thread at fucking all. So some other games did some shitty stuff, so it’s ok for GF to do it too? How the fuck does that make any sense? Don’t you want your game to be good? The lengths people are going to defend Gamefreak literally taking out half the game and putting it behind a paywall is fucking ridiculous, and it’s definitely not the same has SSBU having like 3 characters behind a paywall. 

You guys are fucking ridiculous, and I sincerely hope you all just work for GFs marketing department or something."
PokemonSwordAndShield,fdsx3cr,t3_emu0sr,1578709067.0,"I can’t believe you guys are defending this bullshit lmao. Guess the franchise I once loved is gone forever if there are really this many people ok with this shit. Thanks guys for encouraging GF to continue fucking up one of the best games to ever exist.

Edit: downvote me all you want. Fucking idiots"

VideoEditing,fdha3i7,t1_fdh89h0,1578418651.0,"Yeah that should be fine. I’m not sure what other people are talking about here, but my picture generally looks fine when I’m cutting everything from 120 to 24. Maybe these people just have better eyes for that sort of stuff than I do."
VideoEditing,fdh7rkn,t3_el66ua,1578417215.0,"I shoot music videos, and I shoot everything in 120 because I want to have the option to slow down any scene. It might be hard on your camera to shoot anything that’s more than a few minutes long though. I know my camera has a problem overheating shooting in 3-5 minute increments at 120fps/1080p"

nextfuckinglevel,fdgmwj4,t1_fdgmr07,1578402647.0,I don’t think that’s true. I think you’re underestimating how old 80 is. 70 year old? Maybe. 80? No way
nextfuckinglevel,fdgmi73,t1_fdgmcu1,1578402284.0,lol what are you even trying to say here

news,fddkeq6,t1_fdd3amd,1578315701.0,America is a nation founded by people too insanely religious to stay in *16th century England*. I feel like it explains a lot when you think about it.
nba,fddkas2,t1_fddk5e8,1578315586.0,I mean a five game ban for national games is kind of a lot haha. That could mean your stadium is empty for the NT for months. I think they were just exaggerating though.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fddk2io,t1_fdd1f5n,1578315348.0,I think that’s called being Italian
nba,fddjxw3,t1_fddjsmd,1578315215.0,No... I don’t think they were just talking about Croatia. Other countries have had their stadiums cleared for racist shit too. I think they were just using Croatia as an example.
nba,fddjrb9,t1_fddivyu,1578315021.0,"Just because stadiums haven’t been cleared out often doesn’t mean racism in soccer has stopped. Lukaku has had bananas thrown at him this season, called a monkey, and the owners of his club *sided with the racists*."
aww,fddj0ng,t1_fddgi6j,1578314220.0,"Yeah this pet owner is insanely irresponsible. Not only could the cat kill the sugar glider at any second, you shouldn’t just let your fucking pets attack each other and film it like it’s funny anyways. Even before the sugar glider jumped, I would’ve stopped that shit because the cat could really hurt the lil guy, or ya know fuckin kill him. The fact that they didn’t stop recording immediately after the sugar glider jumped on the cats face pissed me off too."
theouterworlds,fddin4x,t1_fdcujyb,1578313807.0,"It’s been awhile since I played it, so I don’t 100% remember my guys specs. I know I took as many flaws as I could to get to the time dilation movement speed perk faster. I also got the perk that gives you health when you kill someone. 

The dodge tree is probably the most important thing to level up for melee, since there’s a perk that gives you +50% melee damage, one that ignores armor, and one that increases your armor rating.  I also upped two handed obviously. 

I also respec’d into crafting so i could make my weapon as powerful as possible. 

My strategy was to hold down the power attack button,  dodge jump at them, and smack them on the head. It’s not that hard to pull off, and you do a shitload of damage, and you’re pretty damn hard to kill. I turned up the difficulty as was still a god haha"
theouterworlds,fdcgyf0,t1_fdcf7e7,1578274639.0,"Haha maybe that was my problem then. I did two handed melee/dodge. It was fun hoppin around whacking people on the head for awhile, but when you kill everything in 3 hits max it gets kinda boring"
theouterworlds,fdc9mou,t1_fdc8g5t,1578269834.0,"Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed the game overall. The second half just felt like a slog compared to the first half. Maybe it’s because by the time you’re level 15 or so you’re basically a god"

Trying to equate philosophy and astrology at this point in time is laughable. One is a legitimate branch of academia. One is an app on quirky girls phones."
