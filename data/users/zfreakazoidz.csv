My friend told me ""Dude, no <very offensive word for someone with mental disabilities) will ever marry!"", followed by a big laugh. I turned to him and called him something I won't repeat on here. I told him I had just seen a story of a two people with down syndrome that had married and were living together in their own apartment. I went into a longer rant about his use of words also.   


If I was still friends with him today I would show him SBSK so maybe he would mature a little. Side note, he's still single last I heard.
