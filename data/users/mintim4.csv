I still think about my ex almost every day. 
Like seriously and I just hate that I do. He creeps into my mind all the time. 
I’ll bring it up in my next session. I kind of did before. My therapist said something like, I spent the last 5 years identifying myself as just his wife, so, it’s not easy for me to forget. He told me to just think of the good times but the problem is there was so few and far that I only really have the memories of him NOT being there and I had to cling onto the idea of this romance I have to keep me from going insane from being alone through a deployment by myself, no families and the friends I made for the sake of having friends. 
And then in the end, after all that, I left in the middle of the night and he refused to talk to me ever again. Can you believe it? He threatened me and I left and I’m upset cause he didn’t want to talk to me afterwards? How? 

Aw god damn it."

Well uber won’t let me deliver until this updated, and when I submitted it they wouldn’t accept it because it didn’t have an official signature on it BECAUSE IT WAS DONE ONLINE. 
Sad, how that’s the thing that will stop me from driving. 
Anyways, called and explained. All I get was “well have to send it to a specific team we don’t handle uber eats.”
Got an email saying I need to update my registration. 
Called again explained I DID update it. 
Told me the same thing. 
Got the same email. 
I replied to said email telling them if they aren’t able to accept my registration then they need to stop notifying me because I’m not going down and paying for an already legal registration because nobody actually wants to take the time to realize that my damn state is no longer doing paper sent outs. I would get multiple emails a day.

I had neighbors across the street who left their dog out from 7 am to 5 pm when they got home from work, and it barked the whole damn time. It woke me up multiple times.
I went over the first time to the neighbors and politely asked them to handle their dog better. 
They did. For 3 weeks.
Then they did it again, leaving the pup out and it barked and barked. 
I called animal control. 
The dog was no longer outside. I have no idea what happened to it.
And I don’t feel an ounce of guilt cause people need to TAKE CARE OF THEIR DAMN ANIMALS which includes making sure it isn’t a disturbance to the peace for other people."
