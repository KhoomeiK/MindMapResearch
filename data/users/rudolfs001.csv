Not only do you not provide any solution, let alone an exact solution, you neglect to think about the issue altogether. The automation of today is not at all like the automation of the past. Assuming so is a recipe for mass civil unrest.

The fact is that it's the easy jobs that get automated, and the only remaining jobs are harder. The more gets automated, the harder the remaining jobs become. We're approaching a point where people are simply incapable of learning the skills for these remaining jobs. *What do you do with them?*

Furthermore, with automation, it is the company shareholders that primarily reap the benefits, not the workers.

Take an example that we'll have to deal with in the coming decades: truckers.

As trucking fleets get automated, what happens to the millions of truckers finding themselves unemployed? Trucking is the most common job in the US. How do you shift all of those people to other jobs? Are you really expecting former truckers to suddenly become programmers?

Let's play out a simplistic scenario:

Im a worker earning $100 a month. I spend $50 on food and $50 on jeans.

Now MegaCorp moves in, slashes prices, and cuts employees.

Now I'm a non-worker earning $0 a month, and so I cannot afford my $50 of food, nor can I afford the (now cheaper) $15 jeans. How do I survive (buy food)? 

To be able to buy things (at any price), money is required. In the vast majority of the world, the only legal way to get money is work. If work is no longer available to me, I do not have any money, to spend on any goods, no matter how cheap they are.

So...what do you do with all of the people that have been eliminated for the sake of efficiency?

Where do they get money to buy the (now cheaper) goods?

If you don't provide a way for them to get money, do you let them starve? Do you give them money from taxing MegaCorp? Do you wait until they inevitably turn to theft out of desperation and jail them? 


Very few people are born with burgeoning trust funds that allow them to live off investment returns. So...what do you do with the *vast* majority of people who do not have a sustainable passive income?

**TL;DR** If you don't pay people, they literally won't be capable of buying your goods, no matter how cheap they are."

Psychonaut,fe3n9aa,t1_fe2w8jk,1578850894.0,">hard time separating my secular and spiritual beliefs

Well, that's part of the mystery.

The more I've thought about it, the more it seems there's some inherent paradox in the universe. At its core, the paradox is: Is everything one, or is there another? The singularity-duality paradox.

For example, in some ways, I know you and I are one, yet, I could not even conceptualize a ""you"" if we weren't separate.

It ultimately comes down to your perspective, your level of zoom.

As you zoom in and out, sometimes it looks more like everything is one, sometimes like it is two.

Is a Ying-Yang one circle, or is it two fish? Depends on how you look at it.

Total enlightenment appears to be the ability to understand that it's both and fully appreciate the implications.

Another example: you are one person, one body, with two halves. You are one brain, one conscious experience, with many separate neural networks that also believe the same thing. You are one society with many people. Again, it depends on your level of zoom, going up and down, the pendelum of your belief swings between ""we are one"" and ""I have distinct parts"". And what is music but a swinging back and forth of air pressure, or anything else, which can translated to air pressure (e.g. electrical signal).

For me (heh), the important conclusion is that every time you help someone, you are helping yourself. And every time you hurt someone, you are hurting yourself. Therefore, I try to err on the side of kindness.

My mantra lately has become: ""Be just a tiny bit kinder than you have any right to be, and the world will be better.""

**Edit:**
What's compelling to me about psychedelics, and drugs in general, is that they appear to affect how you move around in this musical space. For example, cannabis clouds you out, so you're only aware of what's immediately present. In a sense, you're ""stuck in the weeds"". You get to know where you're stuck very well, but lose sight of everything else. Acid, seems to ""slicken the slope"", to where it becomes easier to traverse layers than when sober. However, since the slope is slick, it's also much easier to lose your footing and go for a slide.

Psychonaut,fdy7x47,t1_fdy48i7,1578776986.0,"> consciousness exists

Sure, for you, which means it's a subjective experience. However, you have no way to prove that consciousness exists for others, merely that they behave in ways that suggest they might be conscious, but then again...ever watch an animated movie? Those characters also behave in a ways that suggest they might be conscious, but you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who would say animations are conscious.

A thought I've become fond of - Open your eyes, look around, pull up wikipedia, browse a bit, take a walk to a mountaintop at night and see the illustrious beauty of the expansive universe. All of that exists in your mind, nowhere else. 

You are a quark marveling at the atom. You are an atom marveling at the molecule. You are a molecule marveling at the cell. You are a small clump of neurons marveling at the brain. You are a brain marveling at the person. You are a person marveling at the society. You are a society marveling at the universe. You are a universe marveling at the quark. 

It is the process of a point growing into a circle, expanding into a sphere, and back down. Up and down you go, sometimes a little faster, sometimes a little slow. How you bounce around makes the music of your being. 

Sometimes you get stuck in a melody and really go deeply into it, so much so that you forget about the rest of the song and start to believe it separate from yourself.

This is what I believe about myself, that I am a hyper-focused segment of the song of the universe, and when I die, when I lose interest in this segment, I'll become more aware of the whole orchestration and come to appreciate the delicate inter-weavings of each of my focused disciplines.

Take [Russell's teapot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot). If it 'exists', but no one sees it, senses its gravity, or can interact with it in any other way...does it really exist? I would say no, because things only exists in their capacity to interact with others.

It's the old ""if a tree falls in the woods and no one is around, does it make a sound?"" - if it cannot be perceived, does it exist? Ultimately, it depends on how you define 'sound', or in our case, 'exist.'

One was a sparrow of some sort in Canada that flew into my highway bar. It got lodged there for a couple of miles before falling off, quite dead. 

The second was a pheasant that hit me in the chest, right above the heart, and exploded into a cloud of feathers.. That one shook me for a second, and hurt for a while after.

There have been a few others that I've ducked, but who knows how close they actually were.

This is only true to a point. The very wealthy have plenty of disposable income, but don't spend it. And that's one of the troubles with our economy. The money floats up, but doesn't come back down. Our economy is getting very very top-heavy, and soon it'll topple."

I'm quite fond of a depiction like [this](https://imgur.com/qyvSfs1.png), a circle collapsing to infinity ad infinitum (even though I only put 3.5 levels in the image).

You can imagine life as following the path, going up and down levels to traverse the multiverse. Which particular level you are cruising on, your speed, and direction during a particular moment determines your experience in that moment. When, how, and which levels you traverse, and in which particular sequence determines your [world line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line)

Keep taking tabs and you'll start babbling nonsense like the above :P"
