Wigan,ffkvl87,t1_ffk4la9,1580029788.0,"I have walked and cycled both routes from my house in Hindley Green, and it is a slightly shorter distance to Daisy Hill, but it is a bit quicker to get there. 

That is from me actually doing both routes on a number of occasions.

I don’t know what your problem is, but you need to go and get some fresh air and some professional help. You seem to have some quite serious issues."
Wigan,ffkvcuu,t1_ffk1ma1,1580029653.0,"You seem to keep mixing up Hindley and Hindley Green. Again.

What has the distance from Hindley to Wigan got to do with anything I mentioned? Nothing.

Yes, the **edge** of Hindley Green isn’t 3 miles from the **edge** of Hindley. I never said it was. But it **is** 2.8 miles from my front door to Hindley Station. [And here it is on a map, as I know you’re struggling to understand words and numbers.](https://imgur.com/gallery/NEKcEeV) 

I live in Hindley Green and cycle from my house to Wigan frequently. I know what I’m talking about, as opposed to your fucking mental ramblings from wherever the hell you are."
Wigan,ffkswzb,t1_ffk1a60,1580028296.0,"You obviously have no idea about the area, so just keep quiet. The baths are no where near Market Street, they are about 1 mile away. If you are currently walking around at 12mph, we are all impressed. You’re into IAAF world record pace for running. Idiot.

Your whole attitude from the start was shit:

>There is a train station in Hindley you know lol, I would say a walk up the main Street is quicker than Daisy Hill 

Yes, I’m fully aware of where the stations are, I fucking live here you muppet. You given your shit opinion in a condescending manner, and even when I proved you wrong, you say it isn’t your fault because you thought you were right. What kind of prick does that??

By “claiming DVLA”, I can only assume you mean some sort of disability benefit? (But again, I’m sure that you calling it “DVLA” isn’t your fault either) Well no, I don’t, I walk and cycle the area as my transport, which is how I know which stations are nearest, so no, I’m not an “obese lazy git” and no, I don’t claim any disability benefits. Sounds like maybe you should, given the confused gibberish coming out of you.

Just because “you think of the baths in Hindley green” and you “thinking of Hindley green as being near the baths”, doesn’t make it accurate, **or** advice you should be giving anyone. I think you should read [this,](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-squeaky-wheel/201811/why-certain-people-will-never-admit-they-were-wrong) it is written about people like you."
Wigan,ffjmmxq,t1_ffjm9gl,1580001757.0,"The baths are in Hindley, not Hindley Green. The baths are also no where near the Main Street.

So, to be fair, you’re just massively wrong and should have kept quiet."

  “lol”

The Main Street in Hindley is also nearly 3 miles away from Hindley Green.

Daisy Hill is the nearest railway station."
