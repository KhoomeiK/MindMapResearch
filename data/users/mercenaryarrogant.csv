How is this any different than telling someone they're not informed enough to make a  voting decision?  What it boils down to is your assumption these people are so ill-informed about themselves that they don't even understand their own sexual preference due to the ""media boogeyman brainwashing"".

People have been doing this since at least 2200-2000 BC before the media.   Take this Babylonian poem Erra regarding the ancient city of Uruk from that time period.

>Even Uruk, the dwelling of Anu and Ishtar,

>city of prostitutes, courtesans, and call-girls

>whom Ishtar deprived of husbands and kept in their power,

>Sutean men and women who hurl abuse;

>they rouse Eanna, the party-boys and festival people who changed masculinity to femininity to make the people of Ishtar revere her.

>The dagger bearer, bearers of razors, pruning-knives and flint-blades, who frequently do abominable acts to please the heart of Ishtar:

>you set over them an insolent governor who will not treat them kindly, who persecuted them and violated the rites.

Here it is the persecution of these, ""party-boys and festival people"" that is called an abomination.  Not the citizens who are exhibiting their basic rights. 

>You need babies to procreate

Obviously but your larger theory still seems like an of assumption  of the mindset of these people if anything.   Doubt their attitudes were much different than what is felt today in some of the places that still experience higher death rates.  The goal not so much procreating as having a kid that actually lives to adulthood.
