I understand wanting to be satisfied, but it's truly preposterous to me that people just go against hard, concrete biological evidence. Humans are a sexual species. That means having a male and a female. These roles are for reproduction only and are defined by genetics. Sure intercourse has been turned into more of a ""sport"" by humans, but why does that turn into ""gender fluid?"" Or any of the other ones?
