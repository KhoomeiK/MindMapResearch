I understand wanting to be satisfied, but it's truly preposterous to me that people just go against hard, concrete biological evidence. Humans are a sexual species. That means having a male and a female. These roles are for reproduction only and are defined by genetics. Sure intercourse has been turned into more of a ""sport"" by humans, but why does that turn into ""gender fluid?"" Or any of the other ones?

""Underdeveloped or developing countries, as in The conditions in our poorest rural areas resemble those in the third world.""

""By contrast, wealthier countries such as the United States and the nations of Western Europe are described as being part of the “First World.” ... “Third World” remains the most common of the original designations, but its meaning has changed from “non-aligned” and become more of a blanket term for the developing world.""
