Ive had text from a close female coworker who told me she hates to eat with the coworkers when im not around just because its always dull, serious and about work.

Its true, men seem to laugh and giggle around eachother while women just ignore eachother. Unless a man engages them. Same in the gym."

PurplePillDebate,ff2iwot,t1_fez8a06,1579508152.0,"Whats so wrong about mgtow? Aside from the extremists who preach hate about women (which type you have in any rp community) they just dont cohabitate, dont marry and dont want kids. They go their own way and do what they want. I go my own way as well. I dont hate women, i like women and men need women as much as women need men, but i just dont want to be in a relationship with one as i am too busy focussing on myself and myself alone as i dont want to be trapped for life because the system wants me to be a resource donkey.

Edit: 
MGTOW, they want an egalitarian society in which men are free from biased courts, free from feminised education systems, free from being the pack mules of society,

Another user put it more eloquent as i did."

These days incel has been used to much as name calling and a wat to shame people that people actually forgot what it originally was. 


The first online community to use the term ""incel"" was started in 1993 when a Canadian university student known only by her first name, Alana, created a website in order to discuss her sexual inactivity with others.[4][17][18][19] The website, titled ""Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project"",[4] was used by people of all genders to share their thoughts and experiences. In 1997, she started a mailing list on the topic that used the abbreviation INVCEL, later shortened to ""incel"", for ""anybody of any gender who was lonely, had never had sex or who hadn't had a relationship in a long time"".[20] During her college career and after, Alana realized she was queer and became more comfortable with her identity. She stopped participating in her online project around 2000[21] and gave the site to a stranger.[18] In 2018, Alana said, ""It definitely wasn't a bunch of guys blaming women for their problems. That's a pretty sad version of this phenomenon that's happening today. Things have changed in the last 20 years.""[20] When she read about the 2014 Isla Vista killings, and the way parts of the incel subculture glorified the perpetrator, Elliot Rodger,[22] she wrote, ""Like a scientist who invented something that ended up being a weapon of war, I can't uninvent this word, nor restrict it to the nicer people who need it.""[19] She expressed regret at the change in usage from her original intent of creating an ""inclusive community"" for people of all genders who were sexually deprived due to social awkwardness, marginalization, or mental illness.

You march into a country you know nothing of the local culture off (as a GI), demand they act a certain way, take away certain rights and resources they had and then wonder why they seek means to defend themselves/ retaliate.

Do you not see how everything you just said is illogical, wrong, painful and sad at least?

You are still painting yourself as a victim. You are not a victim, you actively persued an affair, so own up to the consequences of your actions.
