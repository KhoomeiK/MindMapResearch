Our existing system have put in place laws for self defense for this very reason. Not being required to retreat from a public place and not having to be physically assaulted are both valid legal stances."

And there's actual video footage of them blowing themselves up while people are trying to rescue them. Plus testimony of allied forces. It's not racist, it's literal events in history."
todayilearned,ffbyztp,t1_ffaha6x,1579787205.0,"Of course fighting has no inherent honor, thats why the rules were introduced. Doing it in the least inhumane way possible is and was the point. Have rules changed since 1100? Duh, everything about warfare has. Do we still frown upon some things based on our moral standpoints? Absolutely yes. That's what honor used to be. That's what war crimes are today. Without it we could just use scorched earth policies like so many other civilizations in history. Kill all the men, elderly and children and take the women. It's a much more effective way to win.

Is it romanticized to suggest we don't kill women, children and civilians? Or romanticized to suggest we don't just execute prisoners? Or are those maybe moral rules we still agree on today? I feel like you're focusing on exceptions and weird rules of chivalry and not the general idea of honor amongst fighting men. It's like calling an entire legal system dumb because you don't agree with nudity laws. Focus on the actual system not individual rules we see as weird centuries later."

you'll also remember from that Mel Gibson film the reasoning behind not shooting officers was the so they could control their men and keep them from doing worse things. Of course it's also a ""gentlemen's agreement"" to keep your upper class alive."
todayilearned,ff9etkf,t1_ff98zsw,1579711482.0,"You're taking the wonky ""rules"" about honor and ignoring some big stuff that still lasts til today because we made them international war crimes. We could have just bombed the fuck out of North Vietnam in 1969 but ""honor"" or morality or rules of engagement or whatever you want to call them keeps us from doing that.

Most of the rules work as long as everyone is playing by them. Take WW2. We start off the war very much taking surrendered enemies prisoner. Until we realize the Japanese don't play that way. If a Japanese soldier surrendered it was likely because he's holding a grenade or setting up an ambush. So now we stopped taking prisoners."
todayilearned,ff9dusk,t1_ff9602m,1579710864.0,"Yeah the Japanese would have done worse if they caught them. We stopped having the non-horror story moments because our enemies changed. Rules of war got thrown out and with it so did mutual respect. 

For instance, our guys in Japan figured out you couldn't really take prisoners pretty quick because it was likely a trap."

Sweat shops and shitty conditions overseas are the fault of foreign governments not having labor laws. It's been that way millennia, laborers in shittier parts of the world have shittier conditions. I'm more for blaming a government that allows the ""abuse"" of laborers inside their country. 

Same with Nestle. Governments are selling their natural resources out from under their own people. That's shitty. Companies can do shitty things individually, that doesn't mean we need to punish all companies or say there money is due to shitty practices.

Jeff Bezos and Walmart however are employing full grow adults that can make decisions about selling their own labor. If you don't like working for Amazon at the $15 an hour everyone demanded (now it's a ""living wage"") then find a new job. These people aren't slaves, it's a free market. Sorry your entry level job with 0 prerequisites doesn't pay 60k and have 5 weeks vacation.

Workers wages have fallen exponentially compared to what? Minimum wage was $3 in 1980 and most places are getting to $15 pretty soon. So, fallen? And CEOs are going to be payed more because they are the talent. They make huge decisions that effect the entirety of companies worth billions. You want LeBron on your team?

KansasCityChiefs,ff4akur,t1_ff4943l,1579559153.0,Yep. Any time and energy they spend preparing to stop our run is less time preparing for our passing game.
KansasCityChiefs,ff3sf7q,t1_ff3mluv,1579547845.0,Good thing we ran the ball successfully a ton yesterday. At least make them prepare for a run game.

Edit: of course it is"

gifs,few546v,t1_fetens3,1579405522.0,"Easily. She has way less control over turning or tilting forces on that bar as she only has one point of control in the center of a long bar with weighted ends. Ever seen a bar flip? Because I have. 

In the end she's doing an already potentially dangerous lift with less control."
gifs,few4lid,t1_fevd731,1579405276.0,"5-6' bar falls on it's end because one supporting point in the middle didn't keep it from tilting. Bar flips left or right or even forwards because one point can't keep it from rotating. Bar then falls away from her 5-6' from where the end falls. Easily 3 feet. 

You're missing the entire point. And that is that she only has 1 point of control as apposed to 2. It allows for completely different balance and accidents coupled with lake of leverage makes it more dangerous."
gifs,fevcawb,t1_fets471,1579395730.0,"Not rolling or dropping it a little off. I said throwing it off. Take it and throw it 3 feet off the platform. See what everyone says. Because if you drop the bar on one end like she's going to do if she loses that is what it's going to do

Did clean and jerks for years homie. Go ahead and lift something heavy over your head with two hands and then one and tell me which way you have more control. Super simple physics."
gundeals,fetr88s,t1_fetgge5,1579378751.0,Any round can be anti-personnel if you're good enough
gifs,fetqqre,t1_fet5re8,1579378502.0,"Dropping to bar in a safe and somewhat level manner is a normal part of weightlifting. She's got to balance that entire bar with just one wrist in the very middle of two points of weight. If she drops one end drastically lower than the other It's not safe. 

If you think bring the bar down safely isn't what you're supposed to do try throwing the weight down outside the lifting platform and see what people say. 

She's got very little control over the bar possibly turning left or right on her or tilting."
gifs,fetckvi,t1_feseduj,1579373942.0,"Sure, but she's a danger to herself, the gym equipment and the people around her. It's not a great idea."
gifs,fet53j3,t1_fesmx4n,1579371874.0,Any decent coach of lifter can watch your form once and find problems with it. Anyone with a basic understanding of physics can find problems with a 6 foot bar with weights on both ends supported at one point in the middle.
gifs,fet49gj,t1_feslg14,1579371698.0,"My goat ass ""it's a safe movement"". She's got a long bar balanced in one hand above her head. If that starts to fall or swing or one end dips she's going to have way more trouble bringing it down safely. 

It's not only unsafe for her but the gym equipment and the people around her. There's tons of exercises she could do to get the same benefit that don't require using two handed equipment."
modernwarfare,fes6cnz,t1_feoihuq,1579361897.0,For the pila and the javelin that's the easier way to get aerial killstreaks because of the number of uavs but I think there's easier ways to get kills and even ground killstreaks. The javelin is by far the worst because of its speed. It's also by far the most satisfying to get multikills with on hardpoint.
MurderedByWords,fervtbo,t1_fepj0h9,1579358885.0,Except it's not over a short period of time. It's been steadily growing since it started. It's how some places are at $15 an hour and in 1980 it was $3
MurderedByWords,ferv4k6,t1_fepnntj,1579358616.0,"So does everyone. Minimum wage in 1980 was $3.10 we're looking at $15 in a lot of places now. 

Highest paid NBA players in 1989 made less than 2 million now they make over 20."
