But. 

If someone gets caught pissing on kids -especially when there is a history of doing other shitty things and getting caught- we can assume that the individual has done other really shitty things and gotten away with it. 

So when I ask you to imagine the *little things* you've gotten away with in your life, most people wouldn't find that creepy, because nobody would assume I was talking about pissing on kids or other sexually abhorrent stuff.  Except for you."

*But it's the way of nature*

You're gonna cherrypick your data because you *want* to cheat.  What it comes down to, at the end of the day, is that you're not that strong of a person.  Deep down inside, you know this.   *Cheaters are weak*.  You could be much physically stronger than me, but mentally, you're weak. You don't have the integrity, the strength of character to commit *even though you're telling your partner you have committed*.

If you're gonna cheat, look it in the eye.  Look yourself in the mirror and say ""I only care about myself and I want to maximize my own pleasure at any cost.""

GetMotivated,fewijhr,t1_feuljsr,1579411247.0,"Hold on here. Insulin regulation is *the* critical factor for diabetics and insulin is a hormone.  You saying that doctor Fung *only* focuses on the hormonal side of things (in a negative way) is like taking issue with an nephrologist for identifying and focusing on a solution for a type of kidney disease.  *Of course* Fung focuses on hormones with diabetes.  It is 100% a hormonal disease.

As for your experience with *extended* fasting...that sucks.  Sorry to hear about your autoimmune issues.   But Fung doesn't advocate anything longer than 72 hrs, if memory serves, and I personally have never gone longer than 24, with my regular, daily fast only being 16 hours.

It also doesn't sound like you're a diabetic and are fasting for other reasons. It's worth underlining the obvious here: The Diabetes Code is for diabetics who need to give their pancreas a break from constant insulin production.   

Intermittent fasting doesn't really have ""limits"" in the sense that you mean if your goal is to simply be healthy and possibly kick T2 diabetes to the curb.   It only has ""limits"" if you're using it for something it is not intended for, ie, getting shredded."
