Now that she has reached an age where she is experiencing new ideas for maybe the first time and she has realized she was in The wrong. She reached out,. She apologized. Does that take away your hurt? No. Ultimately it’s up to you, but you have an opportunity that many people don’t have. You don’t have to suddenly become BFF or anything, but you could begin a NEW relationship with this person. You have hopefully 60 plus years ahead of you."

AmItheAsshole,fca4nw5,t3_egpvs3,1577563004.0,"LOL. You arent taking them to the park. That is not severe. You made them a deal. It was all or nothing.they chose nothing. I teach Kindergarten and my kids are able to maintain a modicum o quiet if there’s a reward in the line. Kids CAN control themselves. They CAN feed themselves. They do. It need 100% supervision in a home. 

I applaud op for sticking to his ruling. You aren’t punishing - you are following through on a promise. Way to teach responsibility and follow through by example.

I find it funny how people say it takes a village to raise a child ( $, babysitting, gifts, praise, attention)  until someone else tries to discipline or give consequences. Then how dare you.  Sigh. People are the worst."
Dogtraining,fca34bc,t3_egrxer,1577562385.0,"Rule of threes for a new dog: 3 days to get comfortable, 3 weeks to know this is home, 3 months to fully trust you.
If you got a young one, it can be a shock to their system to switch foods so rapidly. Stick to what he will eat for now- weight gain and trust is the focus. Wet food will be fine. If you want to slowly add a few pieces of dry into it each time you can slowwwwwly make the switch. I’m talking weeks to get there.
Use high calorie training treats to teach sit, place, stay, come, and potty. Do not ever ever ever yell or punish. It does the opposite of building the trust you want. He’ll obey, but out of fear which is not what you want.
Remember puppies play hard and tire out quick and need a lot of sleep. He will start to bite you and puppy teeth are sharp. There are ways to teach bite inhibition that aren’t punishment based.
Good luck with your new best friend."

Have you ever known a second grade student to sexually assault another student? I have.
There are some things that we, as teachers, are not equipped nor paid enough to handle. Nor is it fair to put myself or  the other 25 kids at risk. It is a school. For education. Not a rehab or therapy facility. 
My primary role is educator. If a child is not in a place to be educated it is not my responsibility to “fix” them. I should feel safe in my classroom.  Other people rights end where mine begin.
