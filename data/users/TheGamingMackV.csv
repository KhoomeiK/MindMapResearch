AskReddit,ffk6bbi,t3_etwkuq,1580017294.0,I am working on building an interest in creating a 2D computer game. I need to get the money for the requirements though such as a good computer. I’m also a digital artist and am currently working on some concept art of some characters. Ever played Divine Intervention? The flash game made by the same guy who made Happy Wheels. If Jim Bonacci has no plan to create a part 2 then I’ll do it myself no matter how long it takes. I got ideas in mind.  I even have support from users on Happy Wheels Discord.
