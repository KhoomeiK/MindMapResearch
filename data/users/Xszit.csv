I'd recommend watching in general if you've never seen them and you are hungry for more, but for me personally I'm gonna keep my fond memories where they are.

""power of the daleks"" was one of the classics that recently got some new treatment.  A lot of the original video is lost so they took the soundtrack and laid it over a cartoon to replace the missing video.  You mentioned wanting to know more about the daleks so that may be a place to start?"
doctorwho,fe3iwel,t3_ennp4k,1578849652.0,"The only reason to watch the Eccleston season is to get additional backstory for Rose and Captain Jack.  Eccleston himself didn't bring much to the role of The Doctor in my opinion.

There are some key plot inconsistencies between the original ""Classic Who"" and the more recent ""New Who"".  Also, the classics were mostly done as epic sagas with plot arcs that span multiple long episodes instead of the current format where there's a few loosely related episodes that don't form a cohesive story arc (with the exception the Matt Smith New Who seasons, best plot lines and overarching story of all of New Who so far.).  Some who are used to the flashy visual effects and instant gratification of a story that resolves within one episode may not have the patience for the slower story telling focus of the classics. 

That said, It would give you an overall better view of the lore and history of some of the characters that appear in New Who with relationships to the characters from the classics but it's not entirely necessary to watch all the classics to appreciate the newer seasons since there's not a direct storyline link between them so I think it's really just a matter of how deep down the rabbit hole do you want to go and how much more you crave after seeing all the newer seasons.

If you get to the point where you want more, don't forget about the Torchwood and Class spin off series, and to a lesser extent the Sarah Jane Chronicles, all these are set in the same world but focus on new characters or former companions after they went their separate ways from the Doctor.  I think those more recent spins offs would be more enjoyable for someone who started with the most recent season compared to going all the way back to the beginning."

todayilearned,fdibvr7,t1_fdiaapt,1578439432.0,"Credit card companies commonly sell debts to each other as a standard practice.  I think the law says within the first 7-10 years you have legal options like taking it to court, but that costs money so they will try to ride it out for a year or two doing the cheap way of just calling and harassing.

After a couple of years they have to choose - is it worth going to court or do we cut our losses here?  If they cut their losses it doesn't mean the debt goes away though, they bundle up the old debts and sell them in bulk to another company for a lump sum that's smaller than the individual value of all the debts but bigger than the nothing they were getting before.

Then the cycle starts over, the new company will try the cheapest collection methods first then after a year or two they just sell the debt again to a third company.

After a few of these exchanges the time limit for actually going to court passes but they can still sell the bundled debts to a fourth company that is willing to take on the risk in the hopes that they will be able to collect some percentage of the debts with aggressive enough harassment.

Knowing this its not hard to see how after changing hands multiple times the time limits pass and the option to just sue them is no longer in the table.  That was the nature of the really old debts department, the company I worked for wasn't the originator on any of those loans, they just bought a bunch of old debt that had already been around the block a few times.

Also I'm sure there's some algorithm where they can plug in the amount of the debt, the costs of taking it to court, and the expected settlement amount and figure out if it's worth the trouble.  I'd imagine $700 is just too far below the minimum cutoff for basic legal costs to pursue it in court so it never went that route."

They start new people off in the ""really old debts"" department, debts where the statute of limitations has already passed and the company had no legal recourse left to motivate the debtor into payment other than calling them and harrasing them daily hoping that they would pay just to stop the calls.

Anyway, we had a file on Bill Gates, it was a credit card account with a $700ish outstanding balance.  It was really him too, *the* Bill Gates, not just a guy with a similar name.  

One of the old timers there said that file had been around for decades and nobody had ever managed to collect because Mr Gates lives behind multiple layers of secretaries and assistants who won't even pass a message along unless they think it's worth his time.

I always wondered if that old credit card debt was used as startup money for Microsoft.  Not like bad credit would hold him back at this point I guess... Seriously, who is going to deny credit to Bill Gates?  He probably doesn't even need to sign paperwork anymore, they probably just let him walk into the vault with a duffel bag and take as much as he can carry."
