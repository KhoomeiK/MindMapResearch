We know the GW balance team is a small group that probably doesn't get to play every single game all day. There are A LOT of narrative missions in the books and CA19 that if you play them instead of ITC or ETC formats end up being a lot closer.

We know that things get put out with big ""shock and awe"" rulesets because that brand new unit is going to make waves on the tabletop. New units and new rules mean that it would take ages from an internal team to test/think of all the interactions. When NOVA hits and you have 1000+ games a day people find those efficiencies. It's kind of like how a game Dev can search for bugs all year but they will get thousands of reports on launch day.

When some of the other GW guys have shown their lists off we have seen and heard them kitbashing weapons and units that don't even have rules. They just give them rules and play. Even in the recent voxcast with Chris Peach he talks a lot about kitbashing units and even giving some weapons that technically are narrative only.

The most likely scenario for these crazy units and meta are simply because the balance team (whoever they are) don't take triple of the most optimal unit for every list or 60 IH Stalker bolt rifles and only consider tournaments. A lot of their balance and points are very likely thematically driven and have varied armies that they test out."

Warhammer40k,ffez5vo,t1_ffek5i3,1579871053.0,"Admech kinda didn't really have a solid direction other than ""Mechanical replacements and builds machines for war"". They were a middle ground between guard and SM, had tanks and troops. Some sentinel copies and an implusor clone. 

But **Bio-inspired/Biomimicry** mechanisms is such a sweet theme to explore. Admech have all this data on creatures and how they survive in harsh world's, they have entire libraries of research and documentation from the Magos Biologists.  

This lends itself to the Admech creating machines and units inspired by biological systems. Take the lessons that evolution had to offer and then create them anew in the machine form.

I don't know if I like all the new units, but I certainly like that if they ran with this theme Admech would very quickly become a super-unique faction that plays and looks differently that guard and SM. I love the speed that these units could bring. Gunlines and castles are for loosers (well, right now they are for winners but those are dirty wins and you IH netlisters know it).

This is even worse if the local school closes entirely. Meaning that families or people are forced into significant commutes and monetary investments to go to school.

Normalized education funding really helps increase the span of locations. A school in a more rural region means that cannot be selective of who comes. Which could negatively impact the chance of investment into those regions because of the fear of getting less educated people in the classroom."

When it comes to the Assault BR's you don't get all that much that isn't already covered plenty by other models.

3 Shots, S4 AP0 1 damage isn't hard to come by in the SM codex. On vehicles and other titanic units you are trying to dice your way through a 2+ or 3+ save on top of wounding on 5's and 6's before buffs. And on top of that there is a good chance you will have to spend your first turn moving up the board with the reduced range.

Centurions, Aggressors, Dreadnoughts, Repulsors, regular tac marines all have options for stormbolters or other weapons at that profile for cheap. 

SBR's at a troop level choice are vastly superior to so many codex choices. And with the Devastator doctrine and the super doctrine from IF they are a huge threat to anything T4 3+ save 2W or less, and even S6-7 vehicles. A group of 10 SBR's shooting at a vehicle put down nearly twice as much damage than 30 ABR shots, and they are cheaper! Against other primaris squad the SBR's excel even more so, and how many primaris units do you expect to face in a tournament setting right now? 

On the other hand I do really like the idea of moving forward up with Aggressors, Dreadnoughts or a Repulsor, I know SM is best at castles and sitting in the back but I hate that playstyle."

Killteams lays out a series of small narrative missions and scenarios where you can start with 100 points of units and then they will gain XP and levels this would be a great place to start in terms of making your own.

If you wanted to deviate a bit and get closer to Battle companies I would probably do something like:

- Each player starts with a roster of 125 total points in regular troops
- Each game is set at 100 points to start, and then the scales increase to 125 and then 150 after some set number of games. 
- After each game players can tally XP/level up their dudes.
- Players can opt to upgrade a units weapons in some form of XP to points ratio. 
- After each scenario / set of games players can refresh N number of basic troops. Maybe a checkpoint system where after a scenario you can get back to 125 rostered points or something.

Warhammer,fdk71nu,t3_elt8w5,1578497544.0,"Speaking pretty generally here rather than giving a single list: Really good places to start are getting the Primaris half of Know No Fear (KNF), Dark Imperium (DI), or Shadowspear. They can be found easily on eBay but you could also check /r/miniswap to see if someone local to you would go 50/50 on the box (best deal for both parties).

NKF/DI come with a batch of intercessors, a captain in Gravis armor (one tough son of a bitch) hellblasters and Inceptors. DI comes with an extra Primaris ancient (buffs your dudes) and 2 Lieutenants.

Shadowspear comes with a big dose of HQ models—Capt, Lieutenant & Librarian—A squad of 10 Infiltrators and Eliminators and suppressors. All of which are pretty solid units right now. 

The box sets are both a very cost effective way to start out and provide a chunk of optional units you might end up taking depending on the game type and missions. 

After that, get your redemptor dread and you will probably have more than 750 points.

______________________________________________

When fielding your army you will want to get 3 squads of troops (5 intercessors/Infiltrators/Incursors/Tacticals/scouts = 1 squad) and 2 HQ models. This is the minimum requirement for a **battalion** which provides you CP at the start of the game to use on extra relics and strategems. You will find information about detachments in the core rulebook.

After that all your extra HQ/Elite/Heavy and fast attack options will diversify how your list fights and what it's good against. At 750 point there really isn't all that much wiggle room, especially being Primaris only, since your 2 HQ's and troops will end up being 400-500 points, really only letting you take 1-2 different units.


As an example:

From the Shadowspear box + 1 box of intercessors set you would get:

**HQ**  

- Captain in Phobos Armour - 99
- Lieutenant in Phobos Armour - 81
- Librarian in Phobos Armour - 101

**Troops**  

- 10 Infiltrators + Helix Adept - 230
- Intercessor squad - 85
- Intercessor squad - 85

**Fast Attack**

- Suppressor Squad - 90

**Heavy**   

- Eliminators - 72


And this can be acquired pretty easily without dropping 200+ USD on multiple box sets of individual units.


From the Dark Imperium set you would have something like 

- Captain in Gravis
- Lieutenant
- Lieutenant
- Intercessors
- Intercessors 
- Ancient
- Inceptors
- Hellblasters 

Rounding off somewhere near 770 points, with 5 more Intercessors you could easily create a list with 2HQ, 3 troops and have 5 hellblasters + 1 more unit."

Warhammer40k,fde0zeu,t3_eku5eu,1578328723.0,"Must have units change up depending on the chapter you pick. 

Right now some of the better units/models that are staples in different lists that are pretty common in my local meta:

- Intercessors: can be easily proxied to have the Stalker BR in IF lists, otherwise regular Bolter is just super good all the time.

- Captain in Gravis: IH turn these guys into absurdly strong, nearly un-snipable HQs. They don't always kill their points back in a gunline, but they can provide a rock solid aura that your opponent must dedicate a significant number of points on killing if the want him gone in a turn.

- Tiggy for UM lists, he is point for point an outstanding librarian, do not overlook him.

- Thunder fire Cannons - No LOS needed for you to dumpster a fragile back-line unit that is shielded by screens, the tremor shells are incredibly good verses a list trying to charge up the board.

- Centurions: Bolter variants can absolutely shit out absurd numbers of dice. On any army that generates extra hits on 6's or gives AP to their bolters it can very quickly snowball into your opponent making way more saves then they expected.

- Vanguard Vets: Still an outstanding source for S8 high AP/Damage hits in melee, and provides an easy Smash captain if your list uses them regularly. Although the Smash capt was nerfed a bit they can still dependability toss down 4-5 wounds at 3 damage each in a charge before invulnerable saves.

- Eliminators: cheap AF heavy, can be shoved into a corner with and still shoot and fish for mortal wounds through infinite thickness walls. Regular rounds can output silly damage in the devastator doctrine. 

- Boltstorm Aggressors: in UM lists can be a great unit to lean on. 

- Inceptors/Suppressors: can turn some tricks with decent chapter traits.

- Repulsor Executioner: Not quite the instant take some may argue, but it's a very solid platform in IH lists and some successor chapters.

- Relic Contemptor mortis dreadnought with twin Las: Excellent platform for lascannons, cheaper than a dev squad and with better BS, toughness, a way longer lifespan and can act as a aura buff with wisdom of the ancients if no captain is near. I would argue that this unit almost always makes its points back in almost any chapter/successor combo. It's very dependable.

- (Relic) Leviathan dread with dual stormcannons: Ever wanted to drop 300 points on a dread that is to angry to die? This guy, is a 14 wound monster with a 4+ invulnerable save that shits out 20 S7 AP-2 2 damage shots. In the devastator doctrine you point this guy at anything and then roll dice until your opponent throws the white flag. Bonus: stick anything with re-rolls, or +1 to hit/wound around him and enjoy ruining the lives of young children every weekend.

- Infiltrators: Not the most competitive unit, but these guys provide a 12"" long middle finger to any army/list that has a lot of deepstrike and ambush. This troop choice completely hard counters GSC, some Blood angels players might screech when you drop these guys in the middle of the board, scions can get fucked when their entire regimental bonus and party trick gets ruled out on deployment. To be clear: These guys are worse than intercessors in every single way, except when they aren't, and then they are hilariously amazing.


The bad;

TBH there isn't that many bad units. Marines 2.0 codex takes most ""meh"" units and makes them usable. And meta codexes turn usable units into reliable output because of super doctrines and bonuses.
