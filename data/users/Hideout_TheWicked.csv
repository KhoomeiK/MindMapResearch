Pretty shit thing to do. However, you will just get someone who recognizes the price is good and buy it to resell.

I found a four wheeler that was in great shape and the price was good. It was 3 hours away and the seller mentioned he had a guy who would be by in a few hours. Even though it was perfect I didn't want to drive over there only to have the other guy show up and buy it before I got there. He didn't show up until 8 that night (I could have made it before then) and then turned around, the same night, and put it up for sale with the same photos for $1500 dollars more. Pissed me off to no end. 

To make it worse, he went back to the guy he bought it from and tried to buy a mule from him. Told him he bought the four wheeler so he could sell it and buy the mule. The mule was *cheaper* than the four wheeler...."

WhitePeopleTwitter,few816m,t1_few6wcr,1579406694.0,"That is in a vacuum. In reality your price is set regardless of pet fee. It is based on what rent is going for for your property in that area. The pet rent almost always is tacked on after the fact. It is usually seen in apartments where there prices are pretty set and the pet rent is just additional income. Most of these places already charge a pet fee upfront. 

I get what you are saying but I would say 90%+ it ends up just being extra money. And that isn't even getting into the fact that doing it Rent + Fee is stupid on its face. Just put your price right out plain for people. Even if it is priced based on rent + fee you can just do rent and be done."
WhitePeopleTwitter,few1bvi,t1_few0c8p,1579404060.0,I own rental properties. I have mentioned that in a few comments.
WhitePeopleTwitter,few19wu,t1_fevzn16,1579404035.0,"Yes, but I can just as easily rent to a non pet owner as a pet owner. I just have much wider market because I take pets. That usually means I don't have to drop my price or wait very long before I get a renter. It also means I usually get the price I want and others might have to lower their price to get a renter. 

I also don't charge pet rent. Nor would I and my price is the same regardless of pets. The apartment places that these pet rent fees started with are just fleecing. Plain and simple. 

Besides, if you don't even allow pets why are you arguing in the favor of pet rent? You are doing it the right way, don't allow pets if that's an issue."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fevxzen,t1_fevxcml,1579402952.0,"You are wrong though. The price to rent is already at the level people are willing to pay. They use pet rent to fleece a bit more because people don't factor that in. The same way cable companies have gone to tons of fees so they can say only $45 when in reality it is closer to 60 or 70. People need to rent and rental owners need renters. Price it correctly and call it a day. Which is what they are doing but getting you with the fee too. At least, that is how I see it. 

Again, this is just the ""fee"" economy at work. Not to mention, if everyone does it then nobody has a choice do they?"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fevx92o,t1_fevwwp8,1579402645.0,"Yea, but that isn't typical. That is a shitty owner not even trying to care for their animals. If it was all over the house yea that would suck. One or two rooms wouldn't be the end of the world. What your describing is typically the worst case scenario though."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fevud0j,t1_fevtzvc,1579401616.0,"There were plenty of options before pet rent became a thing. There are plenty of options in places where pet rent isn't allowed. The places that charge pet rent would allow pets anyway. They are just cashing in on the new ""fee"" economy."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fevswuj,t1_fevrt5p,1579401053.0,"Yes to both. As a matter of fact, my own dog had separation anxiety and destroyed carpet in one room. 

I always factor the time off market into it. Usually a month is long enough to fix almost anything. I expect a month down time regardless. If it is ready sooner, great.

I would rather see a no pets policy then a pet rent. I have properties where I know I will be replacing the floors soon that I will let multiple pets in. I can usually get more for the rent because you have a wider market. Most people have pets and ones with multiple pets know they might not have as many options. I could make more by charging pet rent but it is just fleecing at it worst. Or it is just people who don't know what they are doing trying to be rental owners."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fevrcia,t1_fevqb83,1579400593.0,"I can do entire floors for way less than 5k. I own rental properties and you don't put high end stuff in them. I always expect my home to be down for a month when it changes over. That gives me time to clean and prep it and if it happens sooner great, if not no problem. 

You are going to expect to repair the flooring sooner or later so this should all be factored in already. That is, if you are smart and know what you are doing. 

You will get shitty pet owners that fuck up newish stuff but I usually pay closer attention to places with newer floors. Pet number and floor age and usage factor in to what I'm willing to put in the property pet wise.

Edit: I mean older carpet 2 or 3 pets might be acceptable. Newer flooring and maybe 1 small pet or no pets. You usually get multiple applicants anyway."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fevo8wm,t1_fevnl9k,1579399645.0,"You don't punish everyone for the mistakes of the few. You are the one who said have a 5k deposit instead. That is not even realistic. The losses are not even close to what you think. Rental properties have cheaper stuff specifically for this reason. 

You also already have a refundable deposit. You already have non refundable pet deposits. Having pet rent on top of that is absurd. Don't rent to people with pets if you don't want to take on the risk.

I also say all this as someone who owns rental properties.

Edit: Maybe I should add, I have replaced carpet in entire houses and it wasn't 5k. You typically wouldn't have to do all the carpet anyway but its not as costly as you think."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fevh5mj,t1_feukppg,1579397374.0,"Yea, they just wanted to take your money on this one. That is pretty shitty. All pets smell which is what the first $250 is for. Second should only be for actual damage."

To say you know for 100% certainty Trump wasn't elected legitimately is silly. You can't know that. Hell, the people with the highest clearance in the country probably can't say for sure. You also can't say he is objectively a traitor or corrupt. You simple do not know and that is a guess or an opinion. You can't know for sure.

To your last few sentences, your comment spoke to the fair and square win. He won with votes and votes come from supporters. You adding anything about moral or right is beyond the point.  

Your mind is clearly made up. Have you ever thought that you might be brainwashed? I am not saying you are but you seem to hold just as strong of opinions as the people on the other side.

This first comment you sent me. What does it mean?"
PublicFreakout,fdyx17u,t1_fdyww9v,1578784402.0,What does it mean?
PublicFreakout,fdysxji,t1_fdysj3t,1578783274.0,"> Great... then that means the the EU has a bigger military power together then russia does alone, therefore the EU beats russia even without the US's help. Oh I'm glad you agree.

Does it? I'm not so sure. 

Just because I think Russia could beat the EU in a military conflict doesnt mean im a Russian shill. I don't care about Russia at all. How un-intellectual and dishonest of you to claim I am."
PublicFreakout,fdyg3wl,t1_fdyfuay,1578779449.0,"> I'm mad so you scurry through my search history to find a way to condemn me.

No, that was just funny to me. I was just looking to see the temperament of your other comments. Finding that was just hilarious. I'm still laughing."
PublicFreakout,fdyfgv5,t1_fdyf5nc,1578779196.0,"Again with the insults. Just stop responding if that is all you want to do. You're mad, don't take it out on others. Calm down...

PublicFreakout,fdye93z,t1_fdydjwc,1578778797.0,"That isn't putting words in anyone's mouth. Take the US away and who will be in power? Will the world be better in that situation.

Again, you can disagree with me. Its not a big deal."
PublicFreakout,fdydyvd,t1_fdyc9jj,1578778683.0,"> We really have no confidence that you won't just start blowing up coffee shops in our neighborhoods next

You lost me right here. This is absurd and you know it.

Russia would steam roll Europe right now. China would as well. This is them having been dampened by the US. 

If you truly believe that Russia is not a threat to you, you have no idea what is going on in the world around you."
PublicFreakout,fdyd6gk,t1_fdycm6r,1578778490.0,"I never said I accepted anything. You seem to be putting words in my mouth. Also, why use retarded? No need to throw insults and get nasty. Come on..."
PublicFreakout,fdybz24,t1_fdybct3,1578778141.0,"You can't know that. Nobody can. You are entitled to your opinion though. But it is that, an opinion. We will just agree to disagree."
PublicFreakout,fdyaytv,t1_fdy9kxv,1578777876.0,"> well we don't know

I didn't say that. I said you don't know all the details of either of those ""poor"" foreign policy decisions. They could have been good decisions at the time. They could also be purely about greed. Just saying you don't know. It is easy to sit and pass judgement after the fact. 

But would Libya be better off without the US? Maybe, maybe not. Same goes for Syria."
PublicFreakout,fdy9ad2,t1_fdy8dlx,1578777363.0,"No, I'm giving you the reality of the world you live in. You want perfection in an imperfect world. Hindsight is 20/20. You can't know all the facts all the time."
PublicFreakout,fdy86wr,t1_fdy6jdz,1578777061.0,"There might be more to both of those if you had better optics. Not defending them just saying there is probably more to it than profit or malice. However, those are minor in the grand scheme of things. Again, not defending them just saying.

Also, nobody is perfect and no country in a position of power will be perfect. Mistakes happen and sometimes you operate on information that you can't know is 100% accurate."
PublicFreakout,fdy5qa3,t1_fdy46z8,1578776396.0,In which cases yes? I'm sure it would be great for Russia and China but I doubt anyone really wants to see the world under the thumb of either of those countries.
PublicFreakout,fdy3rce,t1_fdy33gu,1578775775.0,"> They still need to be under scrutiny.

Sure, I never said otherwise. Yet people are acting like it would be so much better if the US wasn't involved. That just isn't the case."
PublicFreakout,fdy1n74,t1_fdy0q99,1578775066.0,"This comment has nothing to do with my comment or my original comment. You are just going off on a tangent now, an irrelevant one.

Remove the US and tell me who wins. Who is going to take over the power if the US doesn't exist?"
PublicFreakout,fdy0v6p,t1_fdxzi1w,1578774893.0,"> Maybe you could entertain the thought that people who stand against US imperialism are opposed to imperialism in general, and wouldn't welcome Russia or China taking the US' place.

Sure, but this isnt fantasy land is it? This is the real world. If you take the US out of the equation right now Russia and or China will take over the power seat. Will that be better?

If you take the US out before world war 2 then it would be Germany. 

I'm not saying any of this is ideal I am just showing you that what you currently have is probably better than what you would have had.

It has nothing to do with goodwill. It is purely me saying your would be worse off if you take the US out of the equation. 

Again, lets live in reality not fantasy. You can not like it, that is fine, but it is better than other options.

Also, no where did I defend anyone. All I said was look at your other options. Complain all you want but realize it can be worse."
