I was vegan for 3 years (and totally ignorant about my skin so my face was a garbage dump at the time) and my dairy cravings never ended so I’ve discovered it’s never going to be worth giving up lol"
dogs,fflud7l,t3_eu5euv,1580044324.0,"I had to walk my dog on a muzzle for 6 months while we trained to overcome her love of eating garbage on walks. No one ever said anything outright mean or nasty, just a couple people asking why she was muzzled. It may mean people give you an extra wide berth and don’t approach but I find that’s an added benefit of a muzzle, not a downside"
dogs,ffgt3wo,t1_ffg8wgk,1579914372.0,"That’s cool that there’s a litter of grandes! They don’t seem like an impossible breed, I just get the impression that they don’t make ideal family pets since they require constant training/management and are so overly sensitive. If you want to chat with someone who actually owns one, send a DM to [@primitivehounds](https://instagram.com/primitivehounds?igshid=2h2f49vapajs)"
dogs,fff49nc,t3_et8roq,1579875304.0,"I know of someone on Instagram who had a Podengo medio from hunting lines and now a pequeño from show lines. They seem like very tough dogs for the average person due to their sensitivity, high energy, intelligence (which can lead to headaches on your part), and independence. They are definitely dogs with high prey drive and unreliable off-leash. I’m curious, since the Grande is near extinction even in Portugal, where have you found a breeder?"

dogs,ffahsyx,t3_esk4o6,1579736059.0,"I’m doing OB280: Novice Smart Prep with my dog at bronze. I thought we could just wing it in obedience since we’re competing in the master class in rally but they’re way more different than I anticipated. Getting her BN was stupidly hard so we’re gonna get serious before we try for her CD

Edit to add: this will be our 6th Fenzi class and all of our rally training has come exclusively from Fenzi. I think the classes are excellent and you get great results"

k9sports,ff3e50x,t3_erfjll,1579539251.0,"Sweet for Certain podcast covers a great variety of topics. It’s mostly interviews with dog accounts on Instagram but there are a few deep dives into topics like reactivity, nosework, off-leash dogs in public lands, and doodle genetics plus Laney is a great host. Another podcast I like is Dog Training Conversations. It’s a couple trainers chit chatting about various dog topics but I’ve learned a lot about drive building, tool use (or lack thereof), etc"

doggrooming,fenbpu4,t3_eq2mck,1579281266.0,"I don’t own an Aussie but here’s what I would do if I did :) They don’t require a ton of brushing so I’d go over the dog once a week or so with a slicker brush (Miracle Coat makes a great one) followed by a metal comb. The areas you want to check and brush more frequently will be behind the ears and the booty feathers as that’s where we see matting and clogged undercoat. Take the dog in for a bath and nail trim every 4-6 weeks and maybe get the sanitary shaved and booty feathers trimmed up so you don’t end up with dingleberries. If you notice your dog slides around on slick floors ask for the feet to get tidied up as well. 
You may notice seasonal shedding with your Aussie so so you should pick up a deshedding rake (Andis makes a good one). Use a deshedding shampoo/conditioner as needed (FURminator, Espree, and Tropiclean are popular, easy to find brands). Other shampoo recs that you can find at your local pet store are Earthbath, Buddy Wash, and Isle of Dogs. I haven’t found a huge difference in effectiveness of various grooming wipes so it’s dealer’s choice on that one. My favorite deodorizing spray brand you’d have to order online but it’s Scentament Spa by Best Shot. They come in all sorts of scents and I’ve loved every one I’ve purchased. More accessible sprays will be Buddy Splash, Tropiclean, Espree, and Earthbath. Enjoy your Aussie!"

petsmart,fe8i97f,t3_eny3bk,1578926427.0,"Ooooooh yeah, suffice it to say we have a grooming customer who has been banned from every salon in my city and will travel up to 5 hours to appointments in other parts of the state. She won’t let us put the dog on the ground or out of her sight, wants us to do assessment with the pet in her arms, screams obscenities at groomers, makes appointments under fake names, shows up late to her express appointments, and accuses us of wanting to cut and abuse her dog. I don’t know why she isn’t banned from all of PetSmart at this point, she’s nothing but bad news"
bathandbodyworks,fe8d4pr,t3_eny6lx,1578924946.0,"Summer and fall for sure. I looove tropical scents, Waikiki Beach Coconut and Oahu Coconut Sunset are probably my all-time favorites. I’m also really into warm scents like Autumn Nights and Bonfire Bash"
bathandbodyworks,fe5mogh,t1_fe5m0p5,1578871476.0,There were signs saying “This fixture $10” but a few testers were out on a 75% off table so I had a price check done on those. They all rang up at $10 and had been misplaced from the $10 table. I asked why they were so expensive when I know they go for much cheaper but the answer I got is just that they’re $10 and not on sale :(
bathandbodyworks,fe5gz5w,t3_ent1jc,1578869323.0,I went to a store yesterday that had two whole tables of tester candles but every one was $10 which is crazy to me. I wish pricing was more consistent between stores because I was ready to throw down on those testers! You got a great haul!
