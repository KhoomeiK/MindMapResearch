amazon,fd487ug,t3_eiwxr6,1578165283.0,"I was just shopping Amazon for flea products.  It's amazing how many are fake.  I had an app that checked for fake reviews, but it never found any, so I removed it.  I posted reviews to let other users know the reviews were fake.  I would like to tell Amazon about the fake reviews, but I couldn't figure out how.  Does anyone know how to report it to Amazon?"
