On the other side, the bully is allowed to do whatever he/she wants to the bullied.

It makes no sense for the bullied to abide by these rules, but bullies tend to be very good at making their targets think that they have no choice but to follow the rules. The bully uses them to hold power over the bullied even when the bully isn't actively engaging in bullying behavior.

So the Republicans (bullies) think that the Democrats (bullied) need to just sit back and take wherever the Republicans feel like dishing out. Complaining or doing anything to stop it is ""bad behavior."" Except, the Democrats aren't just sitting around and taking it. So the Republicans are criticizing them for daring to fight back because it's against the rules the Republicans want the Democrats to abide by.

I went to the Holocaust Museum in DC years ago. It's something I recommend for everyone, though you should set aside a whole day to not only see as much as possible but to mentally recover. When I went there, the exhibit that hit me the hardest wasn't the pile of shoes or walking through the cattle car. Those were rough (especially the cattle car when I couldn't picture fitting that many people in and then realized it was because I was thinking of them as people), but another exhibit was much harder to take.

There was a ""kids"" exhibit called Daniel's Story. You entered a room of Daniel's house just before Hitler came to power. From there, you walked into another room where time had advanced slightly. Things were different, but not in a major way. Minor details changed and it didn't seem ""that bad."" From there, you kept moving from room to room with time moving forward and the changes accumulating (though at a slow rate). Eventually, you ended up at the gates to a concentration camp. At that point, you suddenly realized just how much changed.

Each change was a logical step once you accepted the previous one and it was all too easy to get to the concentration camp stage. It was extremely scary to see in action."

So instead of getting a Democratic elected official that you might agree with 75% of the time, you wind up with a Republican that you agree with 10% of the time (or less).

I'll use an analogy that I used in the 2016 election. At that time, I was a Sanders supporter, but obviously Hillary got the nomination. I had issues with her but phrased it like so: You get on a bus and get to choose who is your driver. Hillary will drive you in generally the correct direction but will drop you off a few miles from where you wanted to be. Trump will drive you off a cliff.

It turns out to be a trap and a video of Joker confirms that Tim is ""in his employ."" 

Batman escapes the trap, of course, and goes back to his batmobile. Once there, he asks the computer to find the location of the ""Jolly Jack Candy Factory"" because that's where the Joker is hiding.

Except, Batman never found anything that told him that fact. He just ""happens to know"" at the right time. They could've solved this easily with a ""Jolly Jack"" sign behind Joker in the video or something. Instead, it's just ""we need Batman to go to the Joker so he now knows where the hideout is."""
