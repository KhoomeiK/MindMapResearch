ConvenientCop,ff7e85t,t1_ff7brzi,1579647512.0,"I mean...How many cars have to use the HOV lane without the required 3 passenger minimum before the law should be enforced?  How do we decide who gets to use the HOV lane without the requirements?    Should we abolish all HOV lanes everywhere?  Do we even need road signs or stop lights?  How about bike lanes, god forbid I drive in the bike lane in my car.  God forbid someone drives over train tracks when the lights are flashing, as long as they make it across safely!  Why even stay in the actual lane when I can go past everyone in the shoulder or median?  God forbid!"

facepalm,fcv2x4q,t1_fcun559,1577993539.0,"This is absolutely true.  In college, our living room area had just a bunch of couches and a coffee table.  We did have a projector on the ceiling but no screen so it wasn't as obvious to look up and see it if you didn't know it was there.  If you looked in our front windows it just looked like a shitty room with couches (which it was.)


The other neighbors in our housing row had x-boxes, TVs, tons of games and movies, blue ray players all out in the visible open.  Guess which houses were armed robbed and which one wasn't?"
