LessCredibleDefence,fff4zek,t1_ffeesxq,1579875838.0,"So the USMC has/had several hundred F/A-18A/B/C/Ds, and several hundred AV-8B IIs. Not all the F/A-18A/B/C/Ds were for carriers, most were purely just landbased fighters for more range/capacity than the AV-8B IIs had.

So you'd think they would replace the F/A-18s with F-35Cs, and the AV-8B IIs with F-35Bs, but they're not. They're only going to buy 80 F-35Cs for their carrier requirements, and all the rest are being replaced with the 340 F-35Bs they're ordering. So they're going to be using F-35Bs as their land-based fighters going forward, likely for commonality, maintenance, and logistics ease."
acecombat,fff4eh7,t1_ffeguwd,1579875405.0,"> Ever wonder why the C variant hasn’t hit full scale fleet use yet?

If you were actually talking to pilots, you'd know it's because the F/A-18A/B/C/D fleet were worn out faster than the USN expected, and ended up replacing them all with F/A-18Es because the F-35 wasn't ready at the time. Now every CVW is 100% Rhino (minus CVW-17 with a single USMC Hornet squadron), and there's no rush for new airframes, so they're taking their time. As Rhinos hit the flight hour limits, they're slowly being replaced with F-35Cs.

This has been public for quite a while, and the Rhino drivers I **ACTUALLY** know, will state this... So I'm not calling you a liar, but, you're pretty blatantly lying, and if the shoe fits?"

aviation,fff3kqg,t1_ffejr7o,1579874774.0,"B-1B can carry some 24 stealth LRASMs (long range anti-ship missile), at ranges exceeding 5000km, which would give Australia back its long range anti-shipping platform it lost with the retirement of the F-111C and then some. F-35A restores *some* of that, but it's still only some 55% of the reach the F-111C had. B-1B would not only match the F-111Cs range, but exceed it by 2.5X over, and would do so with 6x the munitions payload. That would allow for just 5 B-1Bs to exceed the capacity that the RAAF had with 28 F-111Cs.

There has been some talk about Australia buying the B-1Bs when the USAF retires them for exactly that purpose, but almost certainly wishful thinking talks, as the B-1Bs are a nightmare to maintain.

> Whereas the drogue can allow for three to fill up at the same time if it's something like the VC10

Those are correct. However, the boom can refuel 3 aircraft faster than 3 probe and drogues can refuel 3 aircraft. 

Other nations, like the UK, France, etc didn't really get on board with boom refuelers, because large portions of their refueling fleets are also their transport fleets. A French C-130J may be hauling equipment to Mali on a Monday, and refueling Rafales on Friday. US has some 550 dedicated tankers, with 475 having booms. France has just 16 dedicated tankers, with 20 tanker/transports in hand and 35 more on order.

To put it simply, the US has the logistics to support the employment of the boom on a wide scale, while no one else does"

B-1B and B-2 were both designed for low level bombing. Why the B-2 needs to be able to do low level bombing is a good question to ask the USAF as to why they had the B-2 designed at the 11th hour for low level bombing. That said, just wanted to point out that bombers do/can in fact fly low."

AGM-176 (Griffen) is in use on UAVs and the like, but realistically speaking, it's a **very** limited use weapon. It's for low-collateral damage, but still has an explosive warhead. So the US would almost certainly lean to the Hellfire R9X for low-collateral strikes since there's no explosives at all, and the GBU-39 or GBU-53 for strikes involving explosives. Also, things like the GBU-39 cost less than half of what the AGM-176 costs, while the GBU-53 is only 30% more but with far greater range and capabilities."
