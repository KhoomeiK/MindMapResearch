Existential_crisis,ffhfbcq,t1_ffhe00q,1579932853.0,"I hear what you’re saying. Maybe I don’t really understand it either. But when I love anything or anyone, I feel like myself. It just feels right. And I have fallen into the trap of looking for love in other people before. Saying love isn’t real feels like saying I’m not real. If there was a quality, it would just be their natural way of doing things. There’s no quality in me that makes my dog love me, there’s no quality in my cat that makes me love her. I just do. Even if everything else is fake, I really do believe that love is this transcendent thing, but not because of anything we pretend to be. Just because nature loves itself, and we are a part of it. I don’t know what the right way to express love or practice it is. I’ve only in the past year and a half smoothed out my romantic relationship and am in love with a person for the first time, but he doesn’t make all my problems go away. I only see him every few weeks. We work a lot, so somedays our only communication is emojis. I’m not using him to escape that reality of death or the weight of nihilism. That’s not why I love him. I just love him. It just happens naturally."
Existential_crisis,ffekmi0,t3_espgk0,1579851993.0,"The media does a TERRIBLE job of showing good love. When you love someone you see beauty in them. Have you ever heard a song and felt its beauty deep in your core? Perhaps been moved to tears? That is the feeling. You look at that person and it has nothing to do with what is conventional at all. It’s experiencing a person, who they are inside and out, and loving that experience. It’s finding out just how human being human is by being with someone with whom it is safe to strip all the conventional ideas what of you “SHOULD” love and who you SHOULD be. Being in true love can give you the freedom to see yourself for you really are when no one is expecting or asking anything of you. 

The media’s main goal is money, not education. You’re right to feel like it’s crap. Romantic love is an opportunity for an experience, just like friendly love and familial love. It’s not superior. Humans just like sex, and babies because we’re all afraid to die, haha. Movies aren’t there to teach people about real love. Some do a fantastic job, but the “hot girl is scooped up by the strong, handsome, rich man,” trope is ignorant, and why the divorce rate is so high. Don’t waste your time chasing the love you see on TV, it pales in comparison to the real thing. 

Also, yes. You can choose to step into love with another person. We have this hyper-romanticized idea that you have to fall into it and only the “best” people are good enough for it, but that’s not true. If you want to love someone, focus their beauty and the love will come, even if not in the romantic form. This was so refreshing to read and see that other people are thinking critically about these things!"

love,ffbq5s4,t1_ffbbpat,1579778161.0,"Yeah, exactly. When we love something it becomes more beautiful, but its beauty is what makes it lovelier. So when we love something so much is it because we feel like it is beautiful, or is it that it really is that beautiful and we were blind before? Could something so perfect really exist, or does it only exist because I want it to so I manifest an idea in my mind that is really an unreasonable expectation? Do we put on the glasses or open our eyes?"
confessions,ffb9sck,t3_es9teg,1579756526.0,"I realized my great uncle was dating the friend he was always traveling with at my college graduation. My family still persistently calls his partner his friend, which is sad. I think they just don't know what to say. It breaks my heart to know, especially after all the conversations about gay people we've had in my family over the years (not good ones). I'm bi so it was tough for me, but he's in his 80's now. That was his whole life. But last June when they came over to our house my uncle wore a gay pride flag pin right out in the open and well, it was a happy ending. I hope everyone has that freedom one day."

If there is nothing that could keep you from being chill, even the threat of death and immense suffering to you and the people you love, then it is safe to hold onto that part of yourself. I’m not saying you shouldn’t like yourself or your ego, but like the dude who is usually chill, not the chillness itself. You’re not always gonna be chill, and you might not always be the chill dude, but it’s safe to like the dude who was chill sometimes because you’ll always be him. The chillness was just part of the ego. The dude who was chill is the actual you."

ENFP,fet36um,t1_fepw01n,1579371356.0,"This is heartbreaking to happen from teachers though! Please set a boundary, this happening to me from teacher still enrages me. I had a teacher who I TA'd for, did multiple solos and extra performances I didn't have to do for, organized on my own time for, I was the president of his choir for two years and was on the e-board for three, and then after three and a half years I asked for a letter of recommendation six months in advance, and he turned it in two days late. Pretty sure he didn't even start it until the week it was due. Then he threw an end of the year party and didn't even invite me. Most other people in our choir were there. I saw it on snapchat. This kind of shit from peers is fine, but from a teacher, it just makes you feel like you belong on the bottom rung of human existence."
ENFP,fesxn3r,t3_eqbbso,1579369977.0,"This happened to me over the summer. Didn’t really feel like going home and ended up having a super long, deep conversation with the guy at the  local smoke shop. He ended up telling me all about his life and history, and his family and stuff, and then gave me free rolling papers, so it was whatever, it seemed like he just had a lot on his chest. I hung out with him two more times, (kind of out of boredom and a “why not?” Attitude), but the last time he turned into a total creep, and I felt like an idiot, because what did I expect from some random guy I met at the smoke shop? Things like this have happened to me multiple times, like I end up being friends with terrible people because they are approachable, but then because we “get along so well” they let down all their guards and all their gooey problems and complexes spill out, but I’m not surprised because “meh, we all have goo, it’s nbd, no need to feel embarrassed. I get it.” But then they sometimes take the validation too personally and think it means I accepted them because I think they’re better than other people, but really I just kind of think we’re all just out here trying our best. It sucks because I genuinely think everyone deserves to be treated decently and with respect, even if they fuck up, because in one way or another we all fuck up and still are worthy of love. I don’t know, even as I write this I kind of feel like a dick. I’m just not a judgmental person when it comes to being imperfect, only when it comes from trying to hide your own imperfections by stepping on other people."

spirituality,fekwyqv,t1_fekr1cw,1579209323.0,"I think you misunderstood the above comment. We don’t consciously choose all of our thoughts, but we can choose which to validate. It can be something as simple as not committing violent acts when our brains tell us to. When someone is rude to us, we might feel like pushing or hitting them (that feeling is a negative thought), but we can instead feel the urge and choose to resist it because we are AWARE of a more helpful way to handle the situation. Once we are aware of negative thoughts, we can resist them, and once we get a hang of resisting them we can follow them to their true source, or genuine motivation. And once we find their genuine motivation, we can learn to integrate that negative energy into helpful thoughts and actions. Carl Jung talks a lot about this. He calls it “integrating the shadow.”"
