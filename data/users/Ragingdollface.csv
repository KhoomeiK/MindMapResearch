I went through several toxic and abusive relationships where I learned some horrible habits before I got with someone decent and took a step back and told myself ""I really don't want to fuck this one up due to my insecurities and the bullshit of my past."" So I decided to go into it with a clean slate and mature attitude. It didn't always work as I had some issues, but over the years with lots of effort and determination I've been able to make communication, transparency, and empathy my main focus's when it comes to conflict and discussions. It really takes a lot of self reflection as well. Some people need to be single for awhile to really get in touch with themselves.. but it's not impossible to do it while in a relationship.

It's possible.. I mean.. a lot of things are possible. Keeping it closed if she truly wants and needs poly might eventually lead to a breakdown of the relationship as well. I know personally after discovering poly I could never go back to strict monogamy because that's just not who I am anymore. Having those doors closed to me would make me feel trapped and eventually that will lead to resentment and wondering if having to close off a major part of myself means that my partner just can't accept who I am.

JustNoSO,fdnx6k4,t1_fdnauct,1578594660.0,"Nah it's a term created for poly basically to combat the toxic parts where people are treated like glorified disposable sex toys while being promised an equal or at least somewhat fair relationship. For example in some forms of poly there's a main relationship that is protected above all else, and every other concurrent relationship besides that have imposed rules or limitations made to protect the insecurities of one of the partners in the main relationship. Like ""No kissing on the mouth, no pet names, no sleep overs, no other men, no being seen in public, no dates at our favorite restaurant/places. etc"" It's a way to say ""I care about you but I care about other people too and I want their feelings to matter and that relationship to be able to thrive as well without imposed restrictions or limitations.""

It's a way to say ""You are important to me but that does not entitle you to make demands of or control other people who are important to me or how I interact with them."" Which I can see the point of.. but I can also see how easy it can be to manipulate that to mean ""I can do whatever I want regardless of how you feel.""

badwomensanatomy,fcyauxo,t1_fcy6eir,1578077344.0,"There are some great posts here also explaining why animals experience childbirth differently. I can't go as into detail as they did but the gist of it is that human anatomy kinda sucks, and many animals (prey animals especially) can't be too loud during childbirth because that will alert predators. Why human anatomy sucks for childbirth: Because of the size of our heads, babies have to be born basically 'not fully cooked' otherwise birth would be impossible. Unlike most animals that basically just 'slide out' and can walk within hours of being born. Our birth canals / pelvis's are smaller in relation to the large heads our babies have as well which is why it can be so traumatic. That and animals in general experience pain differently due to their strong instinct and survival needs. They've likely evolved to ignore pain or just not experience it as strongly. If an animal breaks their leg it's not always noticeable save for a limp for example. But even so, as others have posted.. some animals do still have traumatic births and not all are silent or easy. Both cats and dogs tend to whine or wail or growl/groan loudly while giving birth still. It's mostly prey animals that are silent. 

Hope that helps. And I recognize you were just curious.. but I also understand why people may be sensitive to the subject and be annoyed about someone questioning something that seems obvious to most. There are even some posts here saying 'well some women take monster dildos so it cant be that bad!!"" ... not realizing that things like that require MONTHS of slow stretching and lube and is entirely different.

I can say that my partner and I are poly and have been together 10+ years now and hope to grow old together, we're also best friends, and still very passionate and very much in love. We've had eyes for eachother since middle school, but didn't talk until much later, and always had eachother on our minds.

Literally moved in together after maybe two weeks of dating. It's crazy, but it worked for us. And while we're poly, and sometimes we've both had separate heartbreaks and short firey relationships with others, we've always supported eachother throughout. I have felt love for another that only strengthened the love I have for him, and him the same. None of the feelings I've ever felt for someone else ever took away from the feelings and bond I've had with him.

I agree except for the bold.. as for the bold.. what in the hell? Okay LEGAL parent is an entirely different thing but it doesn't make someone a parent in a child's eyes just because the law says so. You can take on the financial and moral obligations without having to legally adopt a child.

>The father in the OP has a parental connection. It may not be what it should be, and that's the father's responsibility to fix. It doesn't make him not the father. It doesn't make it right for OP to give the role of father to another guy.

Yes he has some parental connection and beyond that I'm not sure whether he chose only 4 days a month or that's all he could get legally.. regardless it doesn't sound like OP *gave* the role of father to another guy.. it's what the child chose because it feels natural and she hears her sibling calling OP's partner daddy. Stepping in at this point and telling her that no, he's not your daddy, he's *sibling's daddy*, might make her feel alienated from the family. Especially if her bio dad isn't in the picture as much. So she gets very little of bio dad and doesn't even get to consider step-dad as daddy. What do you think that does to a kid? If bio dad wants to be considered 'main daddy' then he needs to step up more and be more a part of his kids life, no matter the difficulties. That's just how parenting works. You have to BE a parent, not just show up occasionally.

>I think that there's a way to encourage attachments and healthy relationships to stepparents without forcing them into the parental role. I mean, what's wrong with someone being 'Steve, the really cool guy that's married to my mom who teaches me stuff, and who I can count on to talk to when I'm sad.'

No one's forcing him into the parental role. He's been in the picture far more than bio dad.. that's just a fact regardless of why. It doesn't sound like OP specifically forced her to call stepdad daddy. That's just how the situation has lead. He also has a bio kid with OP, and the daughter lives with them and is witness to a normal father/child bonding, so she's going to be influenced by that regardless. He's the one who's contributing most to her development as a parent. So she's going to naturally start to see him as her father figure, rather than bio dad who only sees her 4 times a month. It's unfortunate, but that's how it goes. And to sit her aside and tell her she can't call step-dad daddy, when her sibling calls him daddy.. is going to make her feel weird / different / or excluded. The best way to deal with a situation like this imo is for bio dad to step up as best he can and try to be a better father figure than he's being, not force the child to use different labels than whats comfortable to her, that's putting more on the child than there needs to be.. when it's the adults that should carry that burden. Especially because as I said.. when you take away that title that feels natural for the child.. and give it only to the person who's rarely in the picture, it creates a situation where sibling has a daddy who's always around, and daughter only gets the 'sometimes daddy'. Instead of daughter having two daddies.. which to me sounds a lot better than.. this is steve to you and daddy to your sibling, sibling can call him daddy, but you can call him steve, your daddy is the one you see 10% of the time.

Just to comment on the whole 'he even came home and had sex with me the day after' .. as a poly person it's common to get 'fired up' after being with someone else. It's not like having sex makes you not want sex again. I don't think cheating has much to do with the quality of the relationship so much as the mentality of the person who cheats.

AmItheAsshole,fc6l7kf,t1_fc6hnlb,1577483204.0,"True, I've seen shitty circumstances and horrible custody arrangements so I can sympathize with that. But on the other hand I think it's a tough situation for the kid.. because if you constantly remind her step-dad isn't 'her daddy' then it may slightly alienate her from her siblings and main family, and if she doesn't get a lot of time at bio-dads place then she might end up feeling like an outcast regardless of the 'why'."
AmItheAsshole,fc6jzxc,t1_fc69xp9,1577482396.0,"Maybe because it's ridiculous to imply that sharing DNA matters more or the same as someone stepping up to do actual parenting? You can't force a parental connection and DNA matters very little in the eyes of a child. My boyfriend's father chose to never be in his life at all growing up, no child support, no occasional visits, nothing. He didn't want to be tied down. Now that my boyfriend's in his 30s his 'dad' wants to pop into the picture and visit 'his' grandchild because he's lonely and never settled down long enough to create lasting connections or family to care about him. It's no surprise that things were super awkward and after the visit he disappeared again, after sending a long email about how sad he is. It sucks but that's how it is. If the 'actual parent' is actually trying to parent it's one thing.. but of course the kid is going to get attached to the person who's more involved in her life and who actually raised her."
AmItheAsshole,fc6i2g5,t1_fc6brxh,1577481081.0,"You're acting like it's something done TO him and not something that he chose, or that just happens with divorce, new relationships, and time put into parenting. He sees her every other weekend, so what.. 4 times a month? Of COURSE the daughter is going to feel more connected to the step dad when bio dad is rarely in the picture, it sucks, but that's how things work."
AmItheAsshole,fc6g4m9,t1_fc6dkhm,1577479772.0,Okay but being a parent implies you actually parent the kid. You can't put in 10% and expect that to be enough cause 'muh dna'. People shouldn't be concerned with protecting the paternal rights of people who do the absolute bare minimum for a kid.
menwritingwomen,fc6bvyk,t1_fc6ah1z,1577476960.0,When you said child I honestly wasn't expecting a 17 year old. That's probably the least offensive thing I've seen in anime. lol
WTF,fc688yi,t1_fc66jyi,1577474544.0,Yep.. after 6 months of keto the occasional raw carrot tasted like straight up candy. You could even taste the slight sugar coating on most asprin. lol
insaneparents,fc5z0by,t1_fc5wyxa,1577468774.0,"I've only had one person ask for my ID and refuse to drive me because I didn't have it on me and I use to uber twice a day, every school day, for several months."
AmItheAsshole,fc3omqu,t1_fc33acw,1577394761.0,You think one person is going to put Popeye’s out of business? The chicken is already dead. There will still be freezers full of already dead chickens whether he bought the sandwich or not. There will always be a demand.
