bipolar,fek5y70,t3_epkfo3,1579193297.0,"I was rapid-cycling day by day last week. It was induced by an antidepressant. Are you on any medication? Is there something that could affect frequency and severity of your episodes? Don't worry too much about the diagnosis. Almost everyone has doubts, you have to be patient."
bipolar,fejnex4,t3_epfblh,1579180715.0,"My pdoc told me to take multivitamins and especially vit D. I haven't noticed any difference but ya know, it doesn't cost me much. It's just one of those things that you can do, it won't harm you. Just don't expect much."
bipolar2,fee4jk5,t1_fee3pf0,1579026245.0,"There are case reports of Lamictal and Abilify causing mania switch but it's diffucult to say what's happening without knowing the details. I find it odd that your pdoc haven't made any intervention. 2 months is a really long time, you should see a doctor asap if you are constantly cycling."

bipolar2,fedthy1,t3_eonbk0,1579019555.0,Four or more episodes in 1 year is considered rapid cycling.

bipolar2,fe7rhy7,t3_eo2wnx,1578918370.0,"There is definietely more nuance to the bipolar disorder. I'm sorry that you had such experience with psychiatrists. Many don't really consider all the options and it results in treatment that is not effective. Yeah, diagnosis is important but treatment is even more. Find a psychiatrist with who you feel comfortable, who listens to you. It's difficult but for me good pdoc was a game changer. Notice that psych who works at ER sees mostly severely ill people (for example in a state of psychosis or severe mania). Denying the existence of hypomania, mixed states, cyclothymia, subsyndomal episodes... that's just stupid. I hope you will find adequate help."
bipolar,fe6t73c,t3_enwe6q,1578904286.0,"You should read this study, it will give you some idea about how it works and what can you do: Antipsychotic-associated weight gain: management strategies and impact on treatment adherence (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5574691/)"
bipolar,fe6sdh3,t3_eo16q2,1578903140.0,"Term 'mood swings' doesn't capture the whole experience of bipolar disorder. It's not only about mood, it affects your sleep, apetite, activity, cognitive functions, thoughts and so much more. So yeah, I don't like it either."
BipolarReddit,fe3e55x,t3_enp80z,1578848433.0,"Here you can read DSM-5 criteria for Manic or Hypomanic Episode with Mixed Features:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519704/table/ch3.t5/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519704/table/ch3.t5/)   
Maybe it will help.   
I have experienced mixed episode induced by medication but it was classic restlessness and agitation. Complete opposite of euphoria."
suggestmeabook,fe391cl,t3_ennvgs,1578847120.0,**Norwegian Wood** if you want something a bit more grounded in reality. **The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle** if you want something surreal. Both are great.
suggestmeabook,fe38d7p,t3_eno0n6,1578846897.0,"**The Promised Neverland** is an excellent ongoing manga. If you want a classic look into **Berserk**, it's amazing although it really gets going in volume 4 so don't get discouraged. Personally my first manga was **Tokyo Ghoul** and it was a good read but I expected something else so I wouldn't recommend it without knowing your preference. **Bastard** is a short and pretty cool manhwa you can read for free on Webtoon app.  If you haven't already watched anime I would also recommend **Death Note.**"
bipolar,fdrr6bq,t3_emrdwm,1578688436.0,"Obviously it's hypomania, as others have already told you. It's good that you are monitoring yourself. Keeping a mood diary was really helpful for me so I highly recommend it."
suggestmeabook,fdqkpt0,t3_emrolo,1578669008.0,"As for BPD I recommend ""Girl, Interrupted"""
BipolarReddit,fdhd8zy,t3_ela223,1578420293.0,"Mild hypomania is definitely a thing. You can do YMRS (Young Mania Rating Scale). It's used to measure the severity of mania, can be helpful if you are not sure if you are having an episode although take the score with a grain of salt as it's not designed for self-completion. And definitely see a doctor, even if you are not feeling bad right now you can get worse or your hypo episode can be followed by a depressive episode. Stay safe"
bipolar,fddodf6,t3_eksrmk,1578319471.0,"I've been on meds for so long that I don't care anymore. Currently I take 15 pills a day, been worse. And as the other guy said, it's better than injections. If meds are working it's just a minor inconvenience."

Yesterday I had a horrible panic attack. I slept only 5 hours (and I'm on very sedating drugs so this is unusual) and this morning I experienced derealization. I'll probably see my pdoc this week cuz I'm fking helpless."

BipolarReddit,fc60hzp,t3_ege6j5,1577469570.0,"Melatonin works wonders for me. I wasn't expecting much so I was really suprised that it puts me to sleep like nothing else (and I was and still am on very sedating drugs). It's effectiveness highly depends on what is the reason of your insomnia so it may or may not work, you just have to try it. It's OTC but you should always ask your psychiatrist or pharmacist about possible interactions and dangers. Good luck"

52book,fc2nndz,t1_fc2dqcs,1577368321.0,"'The Metamorphosis' was a fascinating read. In my understanding it's open to interpretation so there are endless possibilities on what it is about. I'd like to believe that we all sometimes turn into 'bugs' that nobody wants so it's highly personal how you perceive the story. For me it was mostly sad experience as it took me back to the times when I felt useless and disgusting, just as Gregory with whom I even share my name. I will definitely read 'The Trial' and possibly all of his books and stories."
