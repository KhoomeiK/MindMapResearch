wholesomememes,fgooupo,t3_ezp2hx,1580979205.0,"Yesterday i got my first exam result (1. Semester in university on my way to become a physics/english teacher). I was stressed out all week, because this exam was my worst one yet. For the entirety of my educational carrer 'worst one' ment 5 or lower (i think that equals to d- or something like that) even at my absolute best used to be a 3 (~c/c-).

Then yesterday i got a message from a friend of mine that the results came in..... hesitantly i opened the webside and there it stood: grade: 2,3 result: passed.  I am not joking when i say i laughted like a madman. My entire body was shaking and after almost 13 years now i finally got an extremely good punch to my anxiety. For even just a small passage of time everything, EVERYTHING was perfect. The stars had alligned, the planets were moving in ways never seen before and i could see, feel and hear every gear that makes up the machine i call a body turning faster and faster, comming closer and closer to the point of breaking and with one strong push forward crossed that line. Old and broken gears were torn to shreads by the others limiters found themselfes being atomised and honestly i have never felt more enthusiastic to learn, improve and one day reach my goal. To misquote jack london: when i die i don't want to turn to dust, but to ashes! And let me tell you: I am burning!!! Tomorrow my next exam in physics is sceduled and boy that test does not know who it is up against!!!"

Minecraft,fgi0ymf,t3_eyma8v,1580800640.0,"It lools good, though grand open spaces like the first part are hard to decorate. I suggest seperating the space into rooms. You seem to already have a dining room and a living room. Next up could be an entrance hall, a kitchen or a storage room (since i didn't see a space for storage anywhere, except maybe a barrel or two)."

wholesomememes,fcxgrac,t3_ej63u8,1578062516.0,"In my experience you can achieve ypur goals easier once you give precise details about them. E.g. not :work out more, but :go for a walk once or twice a week. ""More"" can mean anything from 1 push up to a whole military style workout. But if you give exact goals you put up an achieveable goal."
