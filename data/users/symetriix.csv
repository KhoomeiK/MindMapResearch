depression,fcsrz9z,t1_fcsrit9,1577923611.0,"Well I guess I am naturally flexible, I got my middle splits down in a few days and then tried middle oversplit. But that was a year ago. I actually quit contortion a year ago, now I Said to myself, If I will regain my old flexibilty in a month I will try to reach my goal of becoming hyper flexible. And btw Just Google what a lyra, just search it up and look at the Images, then you know, cant really explain this"
depression,fcskmzr,t1_fcsjerj,1577918500.0,"Usually 15min Warm-up for back and Legs, then split, middlesplit and oversplit and then warmed up my back, stretched my upper back, then Mainly focus on my lower back, pushing myself into deep stretches while in Cobra pose, also did a lot of bridges and walked my hands together. I usually stretched at least, 1 hour a day, when I was home Alone it was about 4 hours with a lot of playing aroung and hanging on my lyra :P"
depression,fcrbvqo,t1_fcrab1s,1577899728.0,"It started when I was watching Americans Got Talent on YouTube and saw this younge amazing contortionist Sofie Dossi and I just fell in love with the Art about bending your body, it looks so beautiful. So, I Set myself a 150 day Timer and stretched everyday for several hours a day just to achieve this level of Flexibility. When 150 days where over, well I wasnt at the level that I wanted to be on (being able to lay my head on my butt while bending Back) but I almost could do a Chinstand and some weeks after I had my Chinstand down, It really hurt still but at least I got it. I actually also write like small little Fantasy Novels, I have 22 of Them but I'm too emberassed to share Them since they are Like ""my imaginary World"".. :P"

This hobby made me so happy and I hope maybe you can also find such a burning passion in a hobby, it will really make your life better and you will feel so good about yourself if you get better at your hobby / accomplish your goals.
