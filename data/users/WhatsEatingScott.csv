AskReddit,fenwf8a,t3_eq1wzh,1579291856.0,"Not having to go into my thirties single and lost. All my friends have started their own families and now I'm kinda just by myself all the time. I love myself, but sometimes it's nice to have someone to share life with."
aww,febvkuj,t3_eoatdk,1578963219.0,This is so wholesome and made my day. Thank you internet stranger.
aww,fdo3y25,t1_fdnx6tw,1578598454.0,"Guessing you live in a house with no running water if this little bit of water being showered on this bird bothers you this bad. I mean realistically a toilet probably holds more clean water than what is being used in this video and I imagine you do use the restroom like everyone else. 

It's a bird taking a little shower in a sink. It's not that serious lol."
aww,fdnzudu,t1_fdnzq8z,1578596210.0,Thanks!
StreetFighter,fdnxi9c,t1_fdnv2ss,1578594850.0,Yeah Capcom has always done shady shit like this. They make so much money from SF in general that I dont understand why they dont prioritize making the game as functional as possible.
aww,fdnhy70,t1_fdnhj3j,1578586183.0,"That's what I said, birb."
aww,fdnggss,t1_fdn8avy,1578585287.0,Always someone on reddit who will take something as cute as this birb and turn it into something negative. Bet you take showers tho and that's way more water than this is lol.
