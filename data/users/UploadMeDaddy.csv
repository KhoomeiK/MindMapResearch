Lots of lesbians take awhile to figure out that they're gay, most of us understand completely when we talk about having previously dated men.

Honestly everyone wants to talk about biphobia a lot but I've had a lot of rude shit said to me by bi women and I know I'm not the only one (things like referring to straight sex as ""real sex"", saying that they could fool around with women but could never date one, implying that we just couldn't handle men, saying they want a ""real girl, not a dykey one that looks like a man"", trying to manipulate us into a MFF threesome, etc).

Why the fuck do you want me risking this new heart like that? I know several women who were 100% healthy before that needed a heart transplant because pregnancy fucked their heart up! My team was a lot more understanding later though, they sent me to a very pro choice gyno in the same hospital who did a full hysterectomy on me (endo). At that point though, one of their star heart transplant patients had died in childbirth only 7 years post transplant and I think they were a little less cavalier about pregnancy.

Keep wearing blazers and button downs, I'm sure you look dapper as fuck, but nail polish and lipstick will go a long way towards looking feminine while still wearing the clothes you like. Plus it just looks super hot to have bold lipstick + a suit.

Being as petite as you are though will make clothing shopping a lot harder. Try shopping based on how clothes fit your butt and shoulders, then spend a little more to have the sleeves and pant legs tailored to fit you better. My pants are always too long and I'm 5'5, fortunately my girlfriend's mom will shorten them for cheap."
askwomenadvice,ffbsqpy,t3_esqb5w,1579781351.0,"Finding well-fitting clothes makes a big difference. Too tight or too baggy can make you feel awkward and unattractive, especially if you feel like you constantly have to adjust it. Also, finding clothes that look good on your build will go a long way. I'm built pretty straight up and down, I don't have much in the way of boobs or hips. I've got a long torso and short legs. Dresses that flair out make me look prepubescent, they're not flattering on me, no matter how many I tried, and I feel like my butt is always on the verge of showing. But tank dresses and form-fitting dresses look great, and I can wear super low cut stuff and have it look classy and cute instead of too much cleavage. My friend who is short and curvy is the exact opposite and almost exclusively wears skirts that flair out, they look fantastic on her and flatter her small waist and big butt, but her boobs are too big to wear super low cut anything without them practically falling out. Finding clothes that show off the parts of you that you like is better than finding clothes that hide the parts you hate.

  


Another small tip for revealing clothing is picking one thing to reveal at a time. Wearing a crop top with jeans or a long skirt, so just your midriff is showing but not your cleavage or legs, or short shorts with a normal top, or a super low cut top with looser pants, etc. You won't feel as though you're going out too skimpy, just revealing enough to be cute and sexy."

To answer your question, I'm going to talk about myself for a minute, since that's the only perspective I can answer this from. I am not massively successful. I'm a 28-year-old college dropout with a couple grand in savings and a beat up Ford Focus. I have no kids and no plans for them ever. I'm a bartender for a living and I rent my house. I'm not the best at any of my hobbies, and I don't really have a marketable skill outside of being able to follow a drink recipe and flirt. But I'm actually happy where I'm at because I'm doing a job I love, I make enough to survive and have money for my hobbies, and I genuinely don't care that some other people my age are doctors and lawyers, because I don't actually want that. I got very sick and came close to dying at age 20, and that was what made me realize I fucking hated almost everything about my life. I hate school, so I quit. I liked making things with my hands, so I started looking for jobs where I got to make stuff and ended up going from barista to bartender. I hated dating men, so I started dating women. I hated wearing bras, so I quit. I hated my friends, so I got new ones. I missed doing speech and debate, so I went to a local high school and asked to help out with their debate team. I just started asking myself ""do I actually like doing this?"" and that has been my guiding principle since then. stopped asking ""will this make me successful as a person? Will this complete me? Will people be impressed?"" and just started doing things that made me happy at the time. 

  


You don't have to amount to anything: there are 7 billion of us and the vast majority will just be normal people. Take the pressure off of yourself to amount to something great. You're a person and that's enough to deserve happiness. 

  


It sounds like your job is making you miserable, and you feel like your hobbies are a waste of time if you're not the best. You need to try something new, take a risk, look for a new job that sounds fun and interesting, even if it's a ""step down"" from what you are currently doing."

Edit, hit enter too soon: Your current plan of just ""stretching"" and ""keep trying"" to get her muscles used to it is exactly the **wrong** thing to do. She shouldn't have to endure painful sex every time so you can do something you want to, that's cruel.

cocktails,fdjrml5,t1_fcp1qiu,1578484915.0,"Same! I told my girlfriend ""so the cocktails sub is obsessed with clarified milk punch right now"" and she was fascinated with it, we made a london fog rum milk punch tonight and it is completely worth the hype!"
AVoid5,fdjkgds,t3_elmggu,1578475075.0,I don't think that alias fifthglyths count. It's not as though all of us start out knowing about this sub.
AmItheAsshole,fdj6dp1,t1_fdikvh2,1578459715.0,"""I am sensitive/allergic to certain brands, I need to use these ones"" works super well."
transplant,fdj5m5t,t3_elm5t7,1578459095.0,"Not a donor but I've had several abdominal surgeries. Is your skin uncomfortable or is it a deeper pain? Propping yourself up with various sizes of pillows can help (between your legs, in front and behind you, under your side, whatever combination works for you). I use 2 pillows to sleep normally but like 7 when I have a surgery. If it's your skin feeling tight and pulled/stretched feeling, unscented lotion or even just straight oil on and around the site (coconut, avocado, almond, and olive are all good) can make a big difference. It will also help your body heal with minimal scarring."
childfree,fdj5799,t3_elgvjs,1578458766.0,"That's fucking wild. I used to work at McDonald's as a teenager and lots of adults ordered kid's meals, it's a good amount of food for the price. They also sold a ton of kid's meals to adults when Beanie Babies were the toy, they actually planned for it and sent a shitton of them. I'm surprised the McDonald's staff gave a shit either way, it's hot sauce not alcohol, nobody is going to arrest a minimum wage cashier for giving it out, jfc."
childfree,fdgqq0t,t3_el9t41,1578405840.0,"Sex has gotten so much better post hysterectomy me too! No more sensitive cervix, no more randomly starting my period during, it's the shit."
todayilearned,fdgp04g,t1_fdgb58y,1578404461.0,Casinos look like they'll be a blast on commercials until you get there and realize it's not full of tourists having a fun night out but a bunch of gambling addicts staring mindlessly at slot machines.
fatlogic,fdgoq82,t1_fdgnvpn,1578404229.0,"Wow I can't imagine being on the feeding tube still, I'm glad it brings you peace of mind though. Do they think you'll be off of it one day? I ended up getting a heart transplant and most everything in me recovered so I was very lucky."
fatlogic,fdgkwox,t1_fdgk7mr,1578400769.0,"Yeah it's absolutely miserable. I'm glad you're okay now, I hope your stomach was able to fully recover! I had it happen to me too, my stomach and intestines shut down from organ failure and I had to be refed. I'd either get a tiny amount in a feeding tube or a few bites of jello or one ensure. I'm better now though. It makes my blood boil to see these FAs throwing ""starvation mode"" around when they didn't have lunch."
IsItBullshit,fdgklwj,t1_fdg5ini,1578400465.0,"Good to know. Though I would be willing to pay a small amount in interest if it resulted in better credit. The whole idea sounded like bullshit to me, but it was something I had heard from several other people so I wanted to ask."
IsItBullshit,fdgkj2c,t1_fdg5ki9,1578400383.0,"It has a $500 limit and I put more than that in savings each month, I'll be able to use it responsibly to intentionally build my credit. I'm not hurting for money, I'm just going to put my phone bill on it. I've got good credit and I want very good, credit cards can be a good way to boost it if used responsibly."
fatlogic,fdgk91y,t1_fdgdt70,1578400104.0,Yeah it's something to do with your cells not being able to handle the sudden abundance of nutrients after so long without any. It triggers the production of gycogen which can kill you.
AskWomen,fdg8wia,t3_ekvi2h,1578385036.0,"Neutral about it honestly. It's a biblical normal name that's very common, though not as common as Mary or Michael. it's not super pretty or ugly imo.  I wouldn't change it because 1, I've been known as it for almost 3 decades, and 2, I can't think of a name I'd prefer."
IsItBullshit,fdg4v6i,t1_fdcoz6z,1578380096.0,"They'll definitely sell your debt. I have debt collection companies on my credit report from medical bills, and they have definitely called and harassed me."
fatlogic,fdg4pov,t1_fdf6l49,1578379926.0,"Yep, and the solution isn't to load someone in actual starvation mode up with as much food as possible- that will kill them. If they're actually in starvation mode you need to slowly reintroduce their body to small amounts of easy to digest food. And it's entirely possible that they'll involuntarily vomit a lot of it back up. So if those FAs were in ""starvation mode"" they ought to be reaching for an Ensure and drinking it slowly, not eating an entire rotisserie chicken."
falloutlore,fddpeve,t1_fddmu9z,1578320374.0,"That is how it started, but over time people just accepted them as currency. US currency isn't backed by gold or anything anymore and we still accept it."
relationships,fddn9ea,t1_fddepbs,1578318485.0,Hell yeah. I get gayer every time I read about the emotional labor divide in straight relationships. My girlfriend and I are both equally useless.
childfree,fddgih1,t3_eknsjt,1578311268.0,"I love this. I have to make rules for my pushover girlfriend too, but she is cool with it. She referred to me at her lawyer for real life. ""Sorry, my client will not be lending out games/loaning you money/entertaining your rude questions about having children, do not ask again."""
askwomenadvice,fddgdwg,t3_ekgml5,1578311103.0,"In addition to the good advice here, try incorporating a vibrator into sex. It's a game changer."
childfree,fdcp8oy,t1_fdayva7,1578280580.0,"Right??? It's so frustrating, like you're doing the thing that results in pregnancy and you didn't do one of the things men can do to prevent pregnancy (condoms, vasectomy, pulling out, avoiding PIV sex) don't act surprised when it results in a pregnancy. Take this scare as a learning experience and get a fucking vasectomy."
transplant,fdco1tr,t1_fdcmbim,1578279705.0,"Oh wow, that's a good point too. I didn't know that about his death, I mean I knew he died but I didn't realize it was from heart failure."
FixedTattoos,fd8ihq8,t3_ek6xry,1578218765.0,"I personally wouldn't cover this up, especially because you said this design was already too big. You're going to have to go MASSIVE to cover this, and it's gonna be super dark. I'd recommend finding an artist with a style you really love, and asking them to fix up the tattoo a little. If you feel like it's too dark, adding white highlight can brighten it up a lot. You could add in a little pale blue and yellow too."
transplant,fd86nq4,t3_ek54wd,1578214438.0,"Honestly, it's possible that your father doesn't want to go through another transplant. I'm a heart recipient, and I know a lot of older men (60+) in my heart support groups that don't want a transplant. Not to mention that a lot of transplant centers won't do transplants on people over 70 (it's not a hard rule but it's common to have a cutoff age), maybe ask your dad if he wants another transplant at all. Don't volunteer your own kidney until you hear his thoughts on a second transplant."
childfree,fd2ckml,t1_fd0nt47,1578145263.0,"Yeah maybe if our foster care system was much better, but definitely not in its current state. Not that I disagree with you, I agree a basic competency test should be required. Maybe have the consequence of failing be mandatory parenting classes."
relationships,fd1jmuf,t1_fd0wldz,1578132153.0,"The vet receipts they mentioned here will be so useful. Call your vet and request them, just say that you're budgeting or doing taxes or something mundane. Those are an excellent way to prove a pet is yours."
childfree,fd1g3bm,t1_fczw6fx,1578130911.0,"God I remember that. It was awful, those poor kids were trying to make the best of a bad situation and acknowledge that they weren't ready for kids, and their shitty parents would buy them baby stuff to try and guilt them into keeping it (while all 4 were living in like a double-wide trailer)."
