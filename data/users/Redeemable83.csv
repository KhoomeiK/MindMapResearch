nihilism,ff81n5i,t1_fewigss,1579663635.0,For real haha! Apparently stopping eating and drinking is a legit way people die. Terminal patients will do it all the time in hospitals because it's a peaceful way to go while technically not actually killing themselves or having someone else kill them. It's kinda a legal loophole for euthenasia without actually killing someone. It's kinda just choosing not to live lol! They even have dry mouth paste they give you so that you aren't even thirsty while your body peacefully shuts down. Sounds pretty great actually ðŸ˜Š

Semenretention,feibgts,t3_ep8ii9,1579134603.0,"Sometimes that can be really hard because I haven't even kissed a girl in all my 21 years of life, and it kinda feels sometimes like I'm the odd one out. Like I should have gotten that by now, but I haven't, which is heavily depressing and trys really hard to wreck my motivation. But I'll keep going. Any advice?"
