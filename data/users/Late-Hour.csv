Statistically and historically, it's almost impossible to go undefeated all season long, and there will be some ""harder"" games for Liverpool from now until the end of the season, where the whole world will be watching them to slip up. This game is midweek, away, against one of the better teams in the league, who have proven multiple times they can compete with the bigger teams. Wolves are also in a good patch of form. This is where the value is coming from.

That being said, this Liverpool team is something else. I will continue to bet on them until they prove me wrong, as they truly look unstoppable. Take Pool ML here. I know it's a midweek game, but the starters will play. They have FA Cup this weekend, which they will almost certainly field their second team for, as it is not the top priority and against a weaker opponent. I expect this to possibly go down in value, or just be a walk in the park. It's this time every year Liverpool are known to falter, so I think the value is there for that reason.

But this year is different. All that noise is false and just BS to try and get people to HOPE they'll lose. I don't see that happening. They will probably go undefeated all season, so ride the wave while you can.

depression,fed0kp9,t3_eoirtm,1578992645.0,"hey...just a couple of questions if you don't mind, as the first line in your post really resonated with me...

How do you get diagnosed? Do they just ask you a bunch of questions? Is there a test that's done? Does it feel better now that it's an official diagnosis?

Don't mean to intrude...just curious to check out a specialist myself. I'm kind of scared to face it, as I've tried to just push it to the side for more than half my life."

Thailand sounds amazing. 3 months unplanned just living each day on it's own and letting life take you wherever sounds so....blissful.

Thailand sounds amazing. I've never been outside of my home country - Canada. Honestly, I've spent most of my life thus far just bumming around...I can't tell you my happiest memories other than when I was a kid and had no worries. But that's all of us...lol.

All I remember is stressing out about life and all the little things since I was 11 years old... I wish I could tell you my happiest times. You would think it would be my first year at college, but I didn't fit in at all. Or the years after that but I let myself crumble and basically fail and drop out. I owe student loans and a small credit card loan, and am working to pay it off but don't know what I will do in the future. I cannot work bummy jobs for crappy wages forever... can I?

best of luck and u/Dikkens80 if you don't mind sharing, what are some of the most exciting and best moments of your life looking back? I'd like to hear some, especially if this is one of your last days. Every life is worthy of ""good"" memories to be celebrated!"

Now I am struggling with what I am going to do. Probably will be poor forever because I didn't focus on myself when I should have. 

If it isn't too late for you OP, use this feeling to gear yourself to be the best you can be. Become successful in what you want to do, and you'll be able to actually afford to be alone, and live your life doing whatever you want. Even if that is just playing games all day.

Do not do what I have done. Don't let depression eat away at the key years of your life, if you want to find a way out of it. Otherwise, you'll be stuck in this loop.

reading the first bit of your post reminds me of myself right now... I'm currently 23, and been fighting this numbness for as long as I can remember.
