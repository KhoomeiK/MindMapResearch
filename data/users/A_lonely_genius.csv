AskReddit,fdd2k4a,t3_ekgrxd,1578292220.0,"It was super weird, i was dreaming that I was much older, maybe in my mid 20’s (I’m a teenager at the moment) and I was in an apartment with a girl who sounded familiar, but I don’t know who it was. We were lying in bed together, just talking. I was hugging her so tightly, I actually felt like I cared about her. The conversation then turned too us talking about our past’s, which weren’t always happy. I was talking about my shitty times which were actually true, and she was talking about hers. She was talking about how she grew up with anxiety, and how it effected her childhood. She said her fear was that everyone would leave her behind. I reassured her that I would always be there for her, and when she turned to kiss me, BOOM. The dream was over. I never saw her face, nor have I ever had the same dream since. It sucked because when I woke up, I was sad it was over. I don’t know if this was a sign of some sort, but I really hope I can see her again, in a dream, or in real life."
