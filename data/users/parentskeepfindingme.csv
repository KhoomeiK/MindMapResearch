hardware,ffc1guu,t1_ffb8yqy,1579789132.0,"Backporting from 10nm to 14nm would be nigh impossible unless they wanted to spend a ridiculous amount of money. Not to mention the 10nm parts we've seen, have little to no IPC improvements, and the ones they do have, are mitigated by the loss of clock speeds. You can't just ramp up clock speeds of a brand new architecture, especially if you move it to a node it wasn't designed for. 

Look at the Zen architecture, you had a 4GHz turbo as the max 1st Gen, 4.35GHz as the max for 2nd gen, 4.7GHz max turbo for 3rd gen. The 9900KS is the 4th gen of Skylake, yet they've only managed to raise the max turbo from 4.2GHz on the 6700k, to 5GHz, while going from a 91W TDP to 127W"
