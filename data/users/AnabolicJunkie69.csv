Coomer,ffd7gnc,t1_ffcr3xq,1579814901.0,"Look into first time home buyer loans. A lot of times, you can get a loan with no downpayment with mortgage equal to or just a little more than what you pay for rent. Bought a home last year, no downpayment,  already projected to make $50,000 in 5 years. 

When you're ready, stop paying a landlord and start paying yourself. Property is the key to financial success, imo."
kotakuinaction2,ff2gok2,t1_ff285sp,1579505351.0,"I've listened to NPR every morning before work for the last 10 years. Over the last year, they have gone full lib-tard. I'm somewhat of a centrist (I know, I'm the worst) but the blatant hard left push that talk show has taken is disturbing. Alt-left journalists have slowly made their way into every major news org and they don't mind being completely transparent about it. At least back in the day, you could have called it ""fair."" Now I just listen to see how much they cater to the left and bash on conservatives."

Besides, I still haven't seen anyone being ""mean"" in this thread, just people like you who are concerned about other people being mean. People need to stop being so concerned about protecting other people's feelings, especially if they don't know what that person's feelings even are."
WA_guns,feud1m1,t1_feu9q1m,1579385372.0,You make a valid point. I haven't actually looked at the graphs/ numbers. It's historically conservatives who vote in greater numbers and conservatives who vote for keeping gun laws the way they are so it's pretty disheartening to hear.
WA_guns,feu2pgl,t1_fetbk1e,1579382560.0,">Western Washington is mostly anti gun.

You don't know shit about The Olympics. Port Angels, Port Townsend and Sequim all have militias. Hundreds of die-hard patriots ready to roll at the drop of a hat. I don't know about eastern Washington, but western Washington isn't giving up shit. 

Plans are in place if things go south. That being said, don't expect anyone from The Olympics to show up on Monday to the hearings. They're snowed in."
