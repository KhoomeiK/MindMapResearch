CasualConversation,ffkjhwi,t1_ffkj2ma,1580023794.0,I’m very sorry you’ve been through this. I think the fact that you feel that you have to do this because you “have nothing left to resort to” is a clear indication that the relationship is not good for you. I would highly recommend ending it.
CasualConversation,ffki6kk,t1_ffkf6s8,1580023170.0,"I think (and obviously I don’t know either of you, so this is just a guess) that when you proposed this idea to him, that he may have thought you were hyperbolizing to show how serious the issue to you was. Him accepting that was pretty much him saying that he realizes how serious you find this and that he’s willing to work with you on it. I could very easily see this being the case, and it makes sense then that he would be upset to find out you actually called the show. In his mind, trust is being built up because you both have accepted the severity of the situation and are working to fix it. Now he finds that the trust he thought was there isn’t, because you still need this drastic measure to decide whether or not you trust him.

I will say, take a look at how these shows are viewed by the public. They’re part of what’s referred to as “trash tv.” Go on YouTube and see all the clips from shows like this, filled with comments by people who are watching to see people in obviously unhealthy relationships make fools of themselves on live television. Please don’t think I’m saying that you’re foolish or anything, but this is the reality of shows like this. Whether or not he’s lying, he’s right in his ideology that no one in their right mind would go on a show like that. At best, you find out he’s not lying and the only repercussion is that all your friends and family saw a public display of your mistrust in him (which very well may lead to awkward situations and the possibility of arguments regarding your trust in him down the line). At worst, you find out he was lying and in the midst of a very emotional time, you make a fool of yourself on television. You don’t think it could happen, but then again neither did any of those people who chose to go on before you.

Not to make any judgements about you or imply anything, but I really think that this is a drastic and inappropriate measure and that he did not see a world in which you would choose to actually make that call. If you honestly think you need to make him take a lie detector test in order to trust him, whose to say there won’t be another situation in the future where you feel you need the same thing? If you can’t trust him, it’s best for everyone to stay out of a relationship."
CasualConversation,ffkghum,t1_ffke2ga,1580022375.0,"So I’ve pretty much always been a theatre student. Love the stuff. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I’m not really good at math, haha. I was lucky enough to have seen her in *Othello* in Sheffield back in 2011 (I was like 14) and I immediately realized that she was going to be one of the greats. I mean, most of her films are really good. I think it’s not possible to dislike her performance as Cinderella. Seeing her in *Romeo and Juliet* is perhaps one of the greatest things I’ve ever experienced, closely followed by watching her star in *All About Eve.* Her role in *War and Peace* was equally impressive, and I make it a habit to watch it at least once a year. In my opinion, Lily James is one of the (if not the) best actors of this day, and I am further impressed by her with each performance. She has such a range from the manipulative Eve Harrington, to a Disney princess and two of Shakespeare’s greatest tragic heroines, and her heartbreaking portrayal of a single mother in *Little Woods.* One of my favorite personal goals I have in life is to write a role that Lily James would be excited to portray. Besides her prowess as an actor, Lily James is just an incredibly beautiful person. I mean, physically yes, she’s very attractive, but just as a person in general, she seems very human. Watching her interviews, I just get this sense that she’s a person who has really come to realize not only what she wants in life, but also how she can benefit this sort of duty of care we have for one another as humans. She has this sort of grace in the way she moves in the world, as well. I think her interview with Harper’s Bazaar is a good example of what I mean. I feel she’s cognizant of how beautiful she is, but I don’t think she bases her personality around it. I know this is a long winded answer for a very short question, I guess I just sort of got on a roll and didn’t stop. . . At the risk of sounding like some crazy stalker fan, I guess I can just say that I feel that Lily James is one of those people you should watch out for, because she’s headed places."
CasualConversation,ffkdli2,t3_eu3aec,1580021022.0,"I mean, I will say that there are some things that can affect the results of such a test (https://liedetectortest.uk/5-things-that-can-contaminate-a-lie-detector-test). As well, there’s a common misconception that stress can affect the results of a lie detector test, so that may have worried him. I would say that there are other ways to go about getting a lie detector test and whether he’s lying or not, the idea of airing your personal grievances on television doesn’t seem like it would be appealing to anyone. I would recommend (if you truly think you want to give him another chance, and you truly feel you need this test in order to do so) looking into non-public forms of lie detector testing to see if that changes his mind. 

Just sort of my own personal thoughts here, and you can take them however you’d like, if you feel that you need to have a man take a lie detector test to be with him, there’s a fundamental lack of trust. You need to ask yourself if you really want to spend your life with a person you cannot trust because if you can’t, it’s going to be rough, and one or both of you will get hurt. It may be that he’s an untrustworthy person. It may even be that you have trust issues. Whatever the problem is, I feel that the fact that you feel the need to force this sort of ultimatum on a man in order to stay with him shows that there are some serious flaws in the relationship that you both need to fix on your own before you even consider getting back together."

criterion,ffj70v8,t3_etxu29,1579991990.0,"I have always been an avid DVD collector. I actually had some people on this sub chastising me for not buying Blu-ray, claiming that they guarantee that I’d switch to Blu-ray later and that I was wasting my money not just getting them now. I also have a Mac and I think portability is nice. If, like me, you don’t see much of a difference between quality, stick to DVDs. It’ll match your collection, you can use it on your Mac, and the price allows you to buy more, meaning you get to see more movies for the same price."

opera,ffa7z83,t3_esbkyu,1579729653.0,"I recently got into Opera, too. Wasn’t really expecting to, just happened upon a performance of Massenet’s *Manon* and fell absolutely in love. I’d definitely go with that one. There’s a lovely audio recording from EMI, it’s the one starring Victoria de los Angeles, that I would really recommend. If you can get your hands on a copy of the Met’s recent production, that’s great, too. 

Someone already said this, but I second the recommendation of Berg’s *Wozzeck.* very interesting look at the psychology of the burdened worker with some really interesting music.

EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff3ketn,t1_ff31v3x,1579542927.0,"It’s not even if we want to show a film in more than one theatre. If the studio expects a movie to be big, they force us to buy multiple prints. For example, when the new Star Wars came out, they wanted a start time each hour. We have 8 theatres and had to dedicate four of them to Star Wars to meet the compliance. That means four prints of the film, and we weren’t able to show movies in those theatres which is hurting the other movies. Then the studios of those movies get upset and it’s all just one big expensive suck fest."
EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff31v0h,t1_ff31hwz,1579531478.0,"I wish. I wish this so much. I’ve worked at busier AMCs quite often and I really wish we were more like them. Since we have generally low attendance, people feel more at liberty to make a big mess. We also have more shenanigans because people feel they can get away with it. I think the most disrespectful thing we’ve had happen would either be people who turn full drink cups upside down and then break the edges of the lids so they fall off when you pick up the cup, or these dumb-a kids who snuck cupcakes in and left them upside down in the cup holders as a “prank.”"
EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff314yj,t1_ff30ojz,1579530896.0,"Not that anyone asked, this is just a cool sort of fact, I guess, but there’s a common misconception that movie theatres don’t make money off of tickets. I’d say probably 90% of the people we catch sneaking into movies use this as an excuse. We do make money, it’s just not profit. We have to purchase prints of the movies we get, and the ticket prices go towards paying off that large sum, usually a couple grand. After we hit that mark, then the majority of the money goes back to the studio, yes, but we still keep a small portion of the ticket to cover payroll and the electricity used to run the films. When determining which theatres get what films, studios look at attendance records to determine if they think the theatre can pay back the cost of the print. It kind of sucks because some studios usually force us to buy multiple prints (one print per auditorium) of a single film, which can really hurt us if attendances are down for that specific film."
EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff30kas,t1_ff304ze,1579530432.0,"Actually it’s the studios. While my boss does make the show schedule, the studios have different requirements for showtimes which can get really difficult to work around at times when more than one studio has a big release."

EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff2ev3q,t3_er2h02,1579503221.0,"We’re an AMC classic with no reserved seating, and when big movies come out, we usually have people showing up before the last movies are even over. The worst is when people are impatient and fill the hallway so it’s hard for people in past movies to leave.

assholedesign,ff2btvh,t3_er906x,1579500009.0,"I think this is just one of those situations where they paid for heavy advertisement in certain areas (including yours) and hope that the constant bombardment of your home page will sway your opinion. Unfortunately for them, the lack of respect for your privacy (you blocking them and then them forcing the ad back onto your home page) likely turns you off of him more the more you see it. Really wish we could find a better way to advertise, but you think they’d realize that if you block an ad, forcing you to keep seeing it is a bad move."
EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff29t52,t1_ff236fa,1579498067.0,"With the exception of emergencies and people misbehaving, we’re really not allowed to ask people to leave. I’ve worked here for a few years and the only exception I’ve seen is when *Joker* came out. The first few days, we had so many people complaining that they stayed for the entire credits for nothing that our DO told us we could inform people when they bought tickets that there wasn’t anything at the end."
EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff22r4w,t1_ff225zc,1579492221.0,"On behalf of all theatre workers, we hate you. Seriously though, ever since the Marvel movies popularized the use of an after-credits scene, it’s become incredibly common for people to wait until the end of the credits. It makes it hard on us because we’re usually not allowed to clean until the theatre is empty and don’t have much time. When people wait until the end in a busy show, it’s really hard to fully clean by the time people start coming in for the next show. It’s also really hard to get the job done when people come really early for a movie."

opera,ffa7z83,t3_esbkyu,1579729653.0,"I recently got into Opera, too. Wasnâ€™t really expecting to, just happened upon a performance of Massenetâ€™s *Manon* and fell absolutely in love. Iâ€™d definitely go with that one. Thereâ€™s a lovely audio recording from EMI, itâ€™s the one starring Victoria de los Angeles, that I would really recommend. If you can get your hands on a copy of the Metâ€™s recent production, thatâ€™s great, too. 

Someone already said this, but I second the recommendation of Bergâ€™s *Wozzeck.* very interesting look at the psychology of the burdened worker with some really interesting music.

Canâ€™t go wrong with Humperdinckâ€™s *Hansel and Gretel,* and I was also a fan of *La Rondine* by Puccini."

EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff3ketn,t1_ff31v3x,1579542927.0,"Itâ€™s not even if we want to show a film in more than one theatre. If the studio expects a movie to be big, they force us to buy multiple prints. For example, when the new Star Wars came out, they wanted a start time each hour. We have 8 theatres and had to dedicate four of them to Star Wars to meet the compliance. That means four prints of the film, and we werenâ€™t able to show movies in those theatres which is hurting the other movies. Then the studios of those movies get upset and itâ€™s all just one big expensive suck fest."
EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff31v0h,t1_ff31hwz,1579531478.0,"I wish. I wish this so much. Iâ€™ve worked at busier AMCs quite often and I really wish we were more like them. Since we have generally low attendance, people feel more at liberty to make a big mess. We also have more shenanigans because people feel they can get away with it. I think the most disrespectful thing weâ€™ve had happen would either be people who turn full drink cups upside down and then break the edges of the lids so they fall off when you pick up the cup, or these dumb-a kids who snuck cupcakes in and left them upside down in the cup holders as a â€œprank.â€"
EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff314yj,t1_ff30ojz,1579530896.0,"Not that anyone asked, this is just a cool sort of fact, I guess, but thereâ€™s a common misconception that movie theatres donâ€™t make money off of tickets. Iâ€™d say probably 90% of the people we catch sneaking into movies use this as an excuse. We do make money, itâ€™s just not profit. We have to purchase prints of the movies we get, and the ticket prices go towards paying off that large sum, usually a couple grand. After we hit that mark, then the majority of the money goes back to the studio, yes, but we still keep a small portion of the ticket to cover payroll and the electricity used to run the films. When determining which theatres get what films, studios look at attendance records to determine if they think the theatre can pay back the cost of the print. It kind of sucks because some studios usually force us to buy multiple prints (one print per auditorium) of a single film, which can really hurt us if attendances are down for that specific film."
EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff30kas,t1_ff304ze,1579530432.0,"Actually itâ€™s the studios. While my boss does make the show schedule, the studios have different requirements for showtimes which can get really difficult to work around at times when more than one studio has a big release."

EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff2ev3q,t3_er2h02,1579503221.0,"Weâ€™re an AMC classic with no reserved seating, and when big movies come out, we usually have people showing up before the last movies are even over.

assholedesign,ff2btvh,t3_er906x,1579500009.0,"I think this is just one of those situations where they paid for heavy advertisement in certain areas (including yours) and hope that the constant bombardment of your home page will sway your opinion. Unfortunately for them, the lack of respect for your privacy (you blocking them and then them forcing the ad back onto your home page) likely turns you off of him more the more you see it.

EmpireDidNothingWrong,ff22r4w,t1_ff225zc,1579492221.0,"On behalf of all theatre workers, we hate you. Seriously though, ever since the Marvel movies popularized the use of an after-credits scene, itâ€™s become incredibly common for people to wait until the end of the credits. It makes it hard on us because weâ€™re usually not allowed to clean until the theatre is empty and donâ€™t have much time. When people wait until the end in a busy show, itâ€™s really hard to fully clean by the time people start coming in for the next show. Itâ€™s also really hard to get the job done when people come really early for a movie."
