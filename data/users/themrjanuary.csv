depression,fdfpclk,t3_el1d7d,1578367000.0,This. This right here is an essential attitude to have to overcome ANYTHING. It is an acquired attitude that anyone can have. I believe in you!
depression,fdel8im,t3_ekqsl7,1578341399.0,"Some advice from me. I’m 23 and haven’t had a girlfriend yet BUT when I got my first job I met many new friends including girls. In high school I didn’t consider myself good looking because I wasn’t necessarily “popular” but once I met the right people that boosted my confidence I grew my own style, sense of humor, and even went to the gym and guess what. Everyone wanted to date me, I never would’ve imagined this EVER. I could literally pick and choose anyone I wanted (didn’t because I was looking for more of a compatible person rather than just any relationship). My point being is don’t be afraid to be yourself (your true self) Don’t fear judgement because the same people that judge others are the same people that judge themselves and it’s often in a negative light.  Hope that helps, never say never, and March forward, you will thank yourself that you did."

Anxiety,fd9s9vy,t3_ekaj2x,1578237426.0,"So I just started going to therapy this week and the idea of meditation is not to stay in that “meditated state” but rather to pull yourself out of the bad state of mind into the good. This I where that becomes practice and the longer you hold good thoughts the more results you are seeing. I was told that it’s normal to lose track of thought but the idea is to pull back rather. Also what’s helped me is Zoloft, it really does help but I’m still using meditation and other means to make anxiety/depression go away."
