Keep their heat very consistent. Our poor girl has had pneumonia twice, once from a lamp that was accidentally unplugged, and again when the infection didn’t resolve and came back. Thank god for good vets and not being squeamish about giving my girl injections at home.  

Listen to their breathing regularly. Watch their poops. Handle them frequently. Have fun, they’re such lovely animals!!"

Awwducational,fee8ry1,t1_fec33v6,1579028744.0,I think we may have. That rings a bell.

Awwducational,fe9tspe,t1_fe8zs7k,1578941370.0,"My husband and I both got hugged BY manatees. We were snorkeling with them in Crystal River, and one was chewing on my husband’s wetsuit zipper pull and then wrapped its flippers around him and pulled him close. He was a little shocked, and the manatee was quite strong, but it let him go after a second and my husband was thrilled. I was swimming by our boat and I suddenly saw one to my right. It rolled over, pulled me in, hugged me, and swam away, pushing me out behind it. The dive leader of another group was laughing as I looked so startled. It was truly astonishing. She said they like our heat, but I think they just like to hug."
AskMen,f707prg,t3_dtvjqf,1573325356.0,"I met my husband when we both worked a huge office building in downtown Seattle. We worked in neighboring offices for different companies. We started chatting as everyone had to pass my glass-fronted office to get to the bathroom, and I fell asleep at my desk one day. In the course of a convo, he told me he had to go as he was going to work out with his partner, Matt. Cool, I thought, nice gay guy, maybe we’ll hang out. I get VERY UNCOMFORTABLE around attractive straight men, so I was relieved. We became friends, I met and loved his friends, still thought he was gay. A few months later, his coworker told me, in the course of conversation, that he was not gay. The next week, he told me he liked me, we’ve been together 20 years, married for 18."
