AmItheAsshole,ff9mi56,t1_ff94stn,1579716101.0,"Thank you for saying that we should just avoid lists.  Absolutely.  There is no sense in creating a hierarchical map of your relationships, because each relationship is unique and complete and meaningful in its own right, and comparisons between people don't really add anything to your life except discord and resentment.  Love is something that grows the more you share it, and you don't really need to rank people in your life by how much you love them for any reason."

worldnews,ff91dsl,t1_ff8unws,1579702405.0,"Bullshit.  No one actually recycles plastic. My country has been shipping our recyclables to China for decades and pretending that that is the same thing as recycling.  The recyclables are too dirty and contaminated and poorly sorted to be worth trying to recycle, so China was just burning them for energy.

Recycling is possible and happens in small amounts in certain places, sometimes, but it's largely a myth we tell ourselves so that we feel ok using single use plastics."

It's going to affect animals much more than humans, at least at the start.  The animal agriculture sector will feel a huge impact from this, since the reproduction of animals is essential to farming.

What girl in her right mind would suggest *wedding dress shopping* as a way to get to know someone and hang out?  I'll admit, I am a man, so I obviously lack some perspective here, but I simply cannot imagine wedding dress shopping as being a fun way to get to know someone.

Evil is baked into the very matter of Arda, because of the influence of Melkor.   The scouring of the Shire is important because it shows that even though the heroes have defeated Sauron, his corrupting influence on Saruman and on Men in general lingers and has reached even to the idyllic Shire and corrupted it almost beyond recognition. 

The point is that it didn't matter whether Frodo failed or won, either way the Shire was no longer a safe haven and the war was going to get there eventually.  He saved the world, but the whole world has changed anyway, and there is no more ""home"" for our heroes to return to.  Nothing will ever be the same. It will be ok, and things will carry on and people will live, but the idyllic childhood we enjoyed as youths is gone forever.  The world has moved on. 


The fact that you gave zero fucks about the Shire by the end is evidence that PJ didn't tell the story properly."
Silmarillionmemes,fegqhot,t1_fefcz9e,1579100144.0,"You're wrong about the scouring.

AmItheAsshole,fcz0kzx,t3_ejggdx,1578091233.0,"Oh my God.  You are definitely NTA.  Both of your coworkers are being disgustingly misogynistic by suggesting that you ""wasted his time"" because you didn't tell him about your surgery. It shows that he had no interest in you as a person or anything more than a sex object and that neither of them respect you as an equal.  Your medical history and anything related to intimate knowledge of your body are yours and yours alone, and it's up to you who you choose to disclose it to and when.  You do not owe a potential romantic partner prior knowledge of your body and its history before they commit to a *single date to get to know you as a person.* By saying you led him on, not only is he showing an absurd amount of entitlement to your body for a person you just met, but he's also reducing you as a person to the shape and form of your body and giving that primacy over every other aspect of your being, and suggesting that you are not really worthy of the same love and respect as another woman who is ""whole"" would be.  That is absolutely disgusting and completely appalling behaviour.  You are a complete human being and you are worthy of the same respect and consideration as anyone else.  You are not less-than anything and you shouldn't be made to feel as if you have to answer for your body and how it differs from any other body.

Gamefreak is gonna butcher these Diamond and Pearl remakes, and Gigantamaxing is the epitome of the cancerous design philosophy of dumb gimmicks, and arbitrarily restricted availability of forms and features that is slowly robbing this franchise of any coherency. Seeing Gigantamaxing applied so wholeheartedly and accurately to a beloved set of characters that I absolutely do not want to be involved in Gigantamaxing in any way whatsoever makes me extremely uncomfortable.  Your artwork shows talent, and I must say that you have perfectly captured the idea you set out to capture, but the subject matter you have chosen is probably the most repulsive idea I can think of that I'm sure is going to be a part of the remakes.  You've depicted my absolute worst case scenario for the Diamond and Pearl remakes. The only way you could have done a better job is if you had somehow included a depiction of the Underground being riddled with microtransactions.  It gives me Nausea to be confronted by the Other so starkly in viewing this piece. My mind recoils in horror at the realization that there truly exists another mind in this universe, and that it actually wants to see such a thing transpire.  Seeing this image is like gazing into the abyss where dwell my deepest fears and anxieties about the future, the Other, and my lack of control over the things I disagree with strongly but cannot change about the world. 

I do not mean this to be rude, nor do I wish you to take it as criticism of your art or your ability.  I think my opinions about the design philosophy and trajectory of Pokémon are in the minority these days. If anything, I think you should take it as praise.  Art should make people uncomfortable.  

Thanks for listening to my reaction, if you've made it this far without turning away in your own disgust at the Other in me.  I hope you have a nice day and keep making art!"
