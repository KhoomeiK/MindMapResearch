psychology,fef7fab,t1_feetj7a,1579049956.0,">As for general advantages, there are some good studies [here](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7a3d/cab3759aea912878e37991736d55c83dbac2.pdf?_ga=2.51984416.821673044.1579040162-818735188.1555848370), [here](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/99/11/4328/2836760), and [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-016-0621-y) but generally the conclusion is leaning towards there being no clear advantages for transwomen. Most can be explained by genetic quirks that exist in ciswomen as well.

How do you get that conclusion from the articles you cited? The first one concluded the following:

>The conclusion is that androgen deprivation in M–F increases the overlap in muscle mass with women but does not reverse it, statistically. The question of whether reassigned M–F can fairly compete with women depends on what degree of arbitrariness one wishes to accept, keeping in mind, for instance, that similar blood testosterone levels in men have profoundly different biologic effects on muscle properties, rendering competition in sports intrinsically a matter of how nature endows individuals for this competition.

That sounds to me like an explanation of how androgen levels alone do not explain sex disparities in athletic performance, which ends up being a good counterpoint to your first three paragraphs.

The second one didn't seem to mention trans people at all, and was about variance of testosterone in female athletes. Since the first one concluded that male and female bodies respond differently to testosterone even at the same level, it doesn't seem relevant. 

The third one was a review of 8 research papers. Your first article was one of them, and the other seven were about the experience of trans athletes, not performance discrepancies between trans and cis athletes. Somehow they concluded that there were no discrepancies even though the only study they reviewed that even looked at the subject didn't seem to conclude anything either way, although (as quoted above) it pointed out that testosterone level alone is not the only predictor of muscle mass and tone, which seems to imply that hormone therapy can't close the gap.

>It's also relevant to consider the fact that a lot of these concerns will also be alleviated in the future given that now science has progressed where trans awareness and resources to help people transition have become so widely available, there will be less trans people (and therefore trans athletes) who have gone through puberty (of their assigned gender) and experienced any possible biological advantages.

I agree with this. It would be great if everyone who would eventually transition could transition as soon as they knew it was right for them, and that might change the landscape. In the meantime it seems to me that the only reason to believe that trans women who transition in adulthood lose all or most of the biological advantages of being taller and stronger when they transition is out of sheer desire for it to be true, which isn't a very good reason to believe something."

There are more different angles on treating bipolar disorder and substance abuse now than there used to be.

Then, hopefully, it will work and she will start to recover. 

&#x200B;

Or maybe she'll never be receptive to your help, or you'll help her decide on treatment options, do as much research as you can, make personal sacrifices to cover the cost, transportation, attend family sessions, etc and the treatment won't work and she won't recover. Of course, nothing we can say will make that not hurt. But the best way to ensure that you are okay emotionally is to do whatever you can for her and then let that be enough.

My parents can't stomach them for that reason, which is also part of why I don't use AA or NA for support myself anymore, but if that's not a problem for you they are great, supportive communities of people going through similar things.

When we see male chimps raid other groups and improve their access to mates, we don't have to speculate on what the chimps are thinking to understand how evolution favors this behavior. If we observed that a lot of male humans who went to war ended up raping women, or for that matter having consensual sex, as a result of going to war we could conclude that men who were inclined to go to war were over represented in the next generation and that warlike tendencies were selected for in this way. Even if the men had politics or religion in mind as they killed and reproduced, the simple fact that men who liked war made more of themselves than men who didn't would explain  why more men in generations to come might be inclined toward war.

It's sort of crude and unpleasant to think of female mates as resources for males, but when we look at the process of evolution by natural and sexual selection, particularly in non monogamous species, it's hard to see it any other way."
AskSocialScience,fds8pwr,t3_emx546,1578696906.0,"Establishing clear causal links in a case like this is tough, and I'm not going to pretend to answer your question directly. However, I think it's useful to break the question down into smaller questions, which can be answered more easily and with more certainty and then inform the larger situation.

[This source](https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap) appears to fall into the category you mentioned of people who research the gender pay gap in order to prove that it exists and close it. However, in addition to concluding that women in the US earn $.79 for every dollar men earn, they also concluded that women in the same position/title at the same company with the same number of years of experience earn $.98 for the man's dollar. The $.02 gap, while still worthy of our attention, implies that most of the overall gender pay gap probably isn't due to blatant sexism with regard to pay rate for identical work with the same title.

That being said, there is an independent body of evidence in favor of the idea that people, both men and women, discriminate in their attitudes toward coworkers and bosses based on gender. [This](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/women-bosses-more-likely-to-be-called-bitchy-emotional-and-bossy-10090606.html) wasn't actually what I was looking for while googling on the subject but it's interesting - it surveyed small business owners and found that female bosses were significantly more likely to be called ""emotional,""  ""bitchy,"" or ""bossy"" than male bosses. Their survey didn't ask about other unkind words that might have been male-skewed, so we don't know if the men are being called ""dick,"" ""douchebag,"" ""asshole,"" or anything else at a greater rate than women. We also don't know whether, for some reason, women in these workplaces exhibited unpleasant traits that the employees were accurately referring to and that men didn't exhibit as much. 

The study I was actually looking for when I found the one mentioned above was a little more illustrative of what's really going on. I can't seem to find a link to it, but if someone knows the one I'm about to refer to please comment with the link if you have it. This one recorded men and women reading the same script with similar inflection and then played it for participants. On average, the participants rated the women's readings as rude and bitchy and the men's readings as confident. In the previous paragraph I wondered whether female bosses being rated bitchy and such was a consequence of some female-specific behavior that ""bitchy"" refers to. Now we see that, at least sometimes, behaviors seem to be labeled ""bitchy"" *because they are exhibited by women*, and that they are not as easily labeled ""bitchy"" if exhibited by men - in fact, the replacement descriptors might be positive, not even a parallel male gendered slur.

Where am I going with this? The across the board gender pay gap is pretty uncontroversial, but some people appeal to factors outside of sexism in the workplace to explain it. I have heard mentioned such ideas as that women choose lower paying careers for personal reasons or even that many women take maternity leave which holds them back in their career development. Those might be part of the explanation, and they would certainly be hard to rule out completely. But remember that the $.79-$.98 discrepancy is because the latter accounts for title and experience, which could themselves easily be affected by discrimination. Success in the workplace, including not only pay raises but also promotions and assignment of projects, depends on support from all angles. 

If female managers are thought of as bitchy for the same actions that male managers would be called confident for, their teams might not be as productive and they might not get promoted or get prestigious assignments in the future. If women are thought of as annoying when they make requests or demands of coworkers, whereas men would be thought of as assertive, they might not be able to get the help they need to get things done. And certainly if higher ups hear a woman's request for a pay raise as whiny whereas the same request by a man would be strong and endearing, it will affect the likelihood that they'll get the raise.

My final thought is that, as someone who believes in equal pay for equal work as an ideal and believes that we're not there yet, the burden is partially upon me as an employee and a coworker to treat the women I work with equally. Sometimes my bosses do things that make me uncomfortable or ask me to do things that I don't want to do. Am I more on board if the boss is a man? Do I change the language I use when speaking about bosses or coworkers if they're female in a way that makes it harder for them to do their jobs? We can do our best to hold managers accountable for paying equally for equal work and for promoting without discriminating, but we also have to do our part to be mindful of how we treat people ourselves."

evolution,fdewz1v,t1_fddpcmu,1578348351.0,"After some googling, I concede that you are right to criticize my appeal to general consensus. It's easy to find studies that survey populations with regard to their sexual identity, most of which find that the majority of people respond that they are straight and not at all gay. It's far harder to find studies that measure actual sexual arousal. [This one](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep41314) set out to determine whether people who identify as bisexual actually exhibit equal arousal to male and female sexual stimuli, or whether their patterns of arousal more resembled either homosexual or heterosexual people. In the process they used fMRI to scan the brains of homosexual, heterosexual, and bisexual men as they were presented with same-sex or opposite-sex erotic pictures and videos. In addition to the brain scans, subjects reported via buttons whether they liked or disliked the media. Unsurprisingly, most self-identified straight men reported that they did not like the dick pics and did like the pictures of naked women. However, the brain scans told a slightly different story, with some ""straight"" men having an arousal response to both male and female pictures. Even more interesting is that the ratio of arousal to men vs women increased when brains were scanned in response to masturbation videos - more men were turned on by videos of men masturbating than still photos of naked men.

The conclusion is not that most men who identify as straight are actually bisexual, but certainly that a statistically significant percentage of straight men also exhibit an arousal response to a big ol' penis getting played with - and more importantly that there is a discrepancy between the arousal that men report when asked and the arousal we can see in fMRI scans, with some men unwilling or unable to admit that they are turned on by other men.

I tried to write this post not as a direct defense of my initial post but a report of what I found on the subject when fact checking myself. If we think of ""straight"" and ""gay"" as identities that a person applies to him or herself, then everyone who claims to be straight or gay is in fact straight or gay and not bisexual. If we think of them as descriptions of patterns of arousal, with straight people experiencing zero sexual arousal to homoerotic stimuli and vice versa for gay people, it turns out there is more middle ground than self-reporting lets us in on."
evolution,fdcsyjl,t3_ekk5jd,1578283436.0,"I read somewhere, probably on Reddit, the idea that homosexual attraction and heterosexual attraction can be seen as two unrelated axes. It's well known that most people are not 100% straight or gay, despite what we may profess. I have met many gay people who admit that they have some attraction to the opposite sex but for whatever reason choose not to pursue it, and while it is more common for women who identify as straight to openly experiment there is no shortage of men who seek out other men for sex while professing to their communities to be straight.

I think the ""straight"" and ""gay"" boxes that we put people in probably originate in persecution. At some point in our history some of us decided that homosexuality was bad and needed to be punished, and thus it became important for people of all orientations to make sure everyone knew they were completely straight simply to avoid the social repercussions of being accused of homosexuality. Conversely, in the gay community in my area it's relatively common for gay men to pressure men who identify as bisexual to choose a side, which I assume originates in the need of desire for a cohesive, exclusive community also originating from persecution. Also you may have noticed that people who engage in some homosexual behavior are usually lumped in with gay people, not bisexual people, when being teased or insulted.

So maybe more people are bisexual and less people are 100% straight or gay than we let on. Why homosexual attraction at all, regardless of whether it coincides with heterosexual attraction? One argument is that it stems from a need for same sex social bonding in social, cooperative species of animals. Once sexual pair bonding exists it might become a convenient shortcut for organisms to bond with others who they can't reproduce with, and if individuals who have more same sex bonds thrive then some degree of homosexuality should become relatively common. As it is, we do find that homosexual behavior is more common in more social animals.

The last question of why someone might be exclusively homosexual still remains, but now that we've separated the two axes the question is not why someone would be homosexual but why someone would completely lack heterosexuality. In this way the question also applies to asexual people, and I don't have an answer. The best I can think of is that degrees of sexual attraction fall on a bell curve and nature has a hard time cutting bell curves off at just the right point. Just as there are people who are maladaptively short and tall, and just as we could argue that some people are so obsessed with heterosexual or homosexual sex that it works against them, or even as we might notice that some people like food too much or too little to thrive, we should expect some outliers who score very low on the scale of heterosexual attraction. It's not entirely satisfying but at least we're asking the right question instead of scratching our heads at why some dudes like to get it on with other dudes."

MakeNewFriendsHere,fd3n8ay,t1_fd15gbt,1578159909.0,"I'm on the same page. In fact, you just described my first existential crisis pretty well. The question for me has always been how does one proceed with that information? It's sort of a paradox because the question itself seems to take for granted some sort of choice and thus free will, but we do have choice in the sense that individual disposition is a governing factor in our actions and without all the information about a person's disposition and how it will respond to every set of inputs an external (or internal) force can neither govern nor predict their behavior.

I often fall into the trap of overconfidence regarding introspection. I assume that because I have a unique window into how I feel as I make decisions, I alone understand my motivations and capacities, and thus I am the ultimate authority on what I will and will not, and in fact can and can not, do under some set of circumstances. It's a trap because the course of action that I end up ""predicting"" for myself ends up being the most comfortable and least painful one and bypasses any ability I might have to endure necessary hardship and delay gratification, thus shooting myself in the foot. 

I think a firm belief in free will is actually quite liberating in the sense that understanding that one's responses to life are actually fixed allows one to start guessing as to what one's responses to novel scenarios will be and the guesses end up altering the course of behavior to make themselves come true. The key is to acknowledge that, while our actions are fixed via neural patterns, we don't really have much better access to how our brains are wired and how we will behave than anyone close to us does.

A lot of us feel a greater sense of purpose while working and it's hard to have a stable internal state while adrift in a sea of apathy and irrelevance. Not to mention the decrease in stress and dependence that comes with a decent income.

If your symptoms get bad enough, don't rule out treatment. Independent research into topics related to my personal experience of mental illness has also helped me a lot."
BipolarReddit,fcv9cpz,t3_ej2b0r,1577997357.0,"The longest job I've held lasted almost three years and ended when I decided to prioritize my drug habit over going to work. I kept it by the compassion and good graces of my bosses, who always forgave and supported me as long as I was willing to show up every day and do my best to bounce back from various sorts of episodes. The position was management in a sandwich shop, ranging from shift lead to GM and then back down to shift lead before they finally fired me.

Current job is as a grocery store clerk. I've been there a few weeks and my strategy is to give myself plenty of emotional room for continued self-care by not making the position more than what it is, or putting too much pressure on myself to advance or find something higher paying and more prestigious. The work itself is really easy and I'm a socially-driven person so I get enough stimulation chatting with customers throughout the day that it's not mind-numbingly boring. I'm already beating myself up a bit over being so low on the status hierarchy in a region with a lot of very successful people and spending so much of my week doing such simple tasks instead of pursuing some sort of fantastical self actualization, but I'm trying to remember that the problem is not the status or the actualization, the problem is simply that I'm beating myself up. If I can keep learning to treat myself nicely that problem will grow smaller and smaller regardless of what my job or career is."

bipolar,fcti3pb,t3_eitftl,1577944031.0,"There is a time and place for involuntary hospitalizations but it's not five seconds after a therapist first hears their client admit to entertaining suicide fantasies... I hate how the word ""plan"" gets twisted around. When they ask if you have a plan they make it seem like they're asking if you've brainstormed any hypothetical ideas but then when they turn you in its like ""I'm glad you got here so soon! He said he's going to jump off a bridge/OD on drugs/fucking whatever!""

Mandated reporting certainly exists for a reason but it also encourages me to lie to therapists about mild to moderate SI when I'm not in the mood to be confined to a choice of two different but equally bad smelling rooms to sit in for a week or two which is literally always."
BipolarReddit,fcmk1fc,t3_ehxbco,1577778452.0,"Bipolar depression involves hyperactivity in the amygdala which I imagine as a sort of hyperactive red flagger. I have a lot of trouble retaining interests, plans and activities because when I get depressed my brain starts flagging little quirks about them that might be inconsequential when I'm feeling fine as big warning signs that things are not what I thought they were or everything is going to go south and I need to get out now while I can. For me, getting my mood back to baseline doesn't always help because I can't unsee the red flags once I've noticed them.

I've ended a couple of relationships because I suddenly started noticing things that made me feel the relationship wouldn't work out eventually or worse yet things that made me feel embarrassed to be with my partner. The former category didn't really affect attraction per se but the latter definitely did. I've never recovered the attraction once I lost it, but I've also never seen a therapist regularly during this process. As with all of the interests and goals I've given up on, I've just kinda given up and written it off as a loss. I don't want it to be like that. I want to be able to go back to school even though I have a million reasons in my head why I can't and pick up creative projects I've decided were trashy or weird or otherwise against my best judgment. But those things can be put off for years without disappearing. You might not be able to suspend your relationship, either by breaking up or by staying together and pretending you don't feel the way you feel, in the same way and expect to be able to pick it up again after you've had some time to sort things out. I would advise you to work with whatever professional support you have available as soon as you can to try to get through the process of your brain telling you your girlfriend isn't right for you without accepting all the new things you notice as facts"
