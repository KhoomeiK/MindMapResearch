UnresolvedMysteries,ffdv4n3,t1_ffcvuqu,1579829694.0,"I think you have to look at the socio-economic status of many of these women and girls. People view them as ""throw aways,"" or they see them as complicit in their own fates, sort of ""well, if she hadn't been doing what she was doing or going where she was going, it wouldn't have happened to her."" The same thing happens with victims of rape. Many in the public see the victim as being at fault."

Acadiana,fej0gvn,t3_epd4o5,1579152529.0,Well clearly he doesn't believe that Lafayette would benefit from working with good people no matter what their politics are. I just don't think this should be a job where politics plays that much of a part. What does being a Republican or Democrat have to do with drainage? My feeling is that he is just going to cut taxes and raid budgets and we will still have drainage and public works problems that are unfunded and not fixed. Goodbye public library.

He offered us modeling jobs, but of course we weren't going to leave and go with him. He said he'd be out there the next morning. I told my mother about it, and she said she'd talk to him about it. When she showed up and went to talk to him, he first thought she was my older sister (my mom was only 17 when she had me). But then he realized that she was my mom and that she wasn't going to let us go anywhere alone with him, so he drove off and then he never returned, thank goodness."
