But i know people are gonna keep complaining about it because of their 10 games of xbow experiences and how ""easy"" it is to play. You cannot deny that there arent a lot of decks xbow can counter but there are a lot of decks which can counter xbow. I swear people with less than 1k wins with xbow should not be talking about xbow 'skill'."
