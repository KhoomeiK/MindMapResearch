worldnews,fg55fmk,t1_fg54sgq,1580518721.0,"Why couldn't the President just move to dismiss the case for lack of an impeachable offense?  The answer is simply that the rules are the way they are and they aren't the same as judicial trials because the entire process is different from a judicial trial from the very beginning.  You don't need to call witnesses before the Senate because there was already an opportunity to call and cross examine witnesses under oath and on the record before the House.  This would not be the case under a criminal proceeding.  The presumption under the impeachment rules is that the House already did all the witness and document gathering prior to impeachment.  The broader justification in this circumstance is that the Senators have tweeted out their reasoning that even if they accept that everything alleged was true, it doesn't rise to a removable offense."
worldnews,fg54yvz,t1_fg54hnl,1580518394.0,"No what the two senators that cast the deciding vote said was that they accept that everything that the House is trying to prove is true.
