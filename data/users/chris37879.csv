dndmemes,ffs9vx6,t1_ffrx9e5,1580176688.0,"I literally have campaign notes about a town this happened to. They're all just going on with their lives, like nothing happened. It's all these damn rabble rousers passing through that have a problem and won't let them just live their not lives."
dndmemes,ffs9oy0,t1_ffrxzzy,1580176554.0,Wild Magic Wish-based Sorcerer you say? Trickster demon bloodline you say? Oh no.
dndmemes,ffs9fkp,t1_ffs5mxd,1580176375.0,"To me, those are good tools to use against people making fucky wishes. But, in general, the prep and time expended to get a Wish is worth letting them wish for things like a pile of Gold. Now if it's a Djinn granting the Wish, all bets are off."
dndmemes,ffs90nl,t1_ffs3133,1580176096.0,"Yup, Wish lets you alter \_reality\_. It's effects are instantaneous and produce whatever was wished for, within reason and assuming the Wish is actually cast by a player, not granted by a deity or djinn or the like."
politics,ffrpkej,t1_ffqtfie,1580162983.0,"The 'tea party' republicans tried that, it failed. Literally their only hope of being in power is making interest groups inside the party and getting that R next to their names on ballots. That's the problem with making your entire base out of people that you've deprived of education and reasoning skills, the sword cuts both ways."
politics,ffrpa4x,t1_ffriikc,1580162805.0,"Not that guy, but that's how I took it. It's more accurate to say, I suppose, that our use of solar energy is benign/indifferent. That energy will be pelting the earth, what's it hurt if we scoop up some and use it to charge our phones and power our homes and cars? It's not like us using it is going to make it run out any sooner."
politics,ffrojew,t1_ffqx2ok,1580162345.0,"This is the part that kills me in politics. I only register democrat cause our fucked up system excludes me from certain processes if I'm not affiliated. I vote with my conscience and on policy, cause the second you start  being 'part of' a group, it makes it harder to turn your back on that group when you no longer align.

todayilearned,ffmgv7v,t1_ffmar2t,1580054493.0,"Yeah, I agree that an open co worki g space makes sense sometimes, but I think should be inverted to what we have now. You have an office, you relocate to a co-working area when that's what you need."

rpghorrorstories,ffh99uh,t1_fff9olw,1579926813.0,You try to grope another character in my game and suddenly every bbeg ttrpgs has ever had is going to teleport you to their layer and just kill you.  No exceptions.
gamedev,ffgys27,t3_etep4c,1579918537.0,"To my eye, there's no blending between the distinct animations, between 2 and 3 it just snaps to the upper position instead of the dudes arms moving up to that strike. Look into blend trees and it should make it much nicer."
FlutterDev,ffgymxm,t1_fff7804,1579918432.0,"I can appreciate that sentiment, but I respectfully disagree. To me it feels like an extension / improvement of material. These designs don't ground themselves in reality in any way other than the material's presentation and the notion of in and out representing state. They still animate, react, and behave more like material than skuemorphic components."

brakebills,ffe0czp,t1_ffdrl5k,1579833434.0,"Yeah, I was pleased with how that played out, also that the whole golem thing played out in one episode instead of across several. It was a really satisfying episode"
funny,ffdjr2h,t1_ffcq07n,1579822348.0,"See this is one of the bits lost in translation over the years. The original actually reads: ""Thou shalt not steal. Unless thou needest to dunk on thine foe. Then thou shalt dunk  with the fury of the LORD."""
TheLastAirbender,ffdj8hw,t1_ffc68cw,1579822028.0,Just link your professor to this thread and explain that some people would like to peer review his sources.

ProgrammerHumor,ffaflde,t1_ff9c3t7,1579734592.0,"And you never will! I program in a about a dozen different languages, but I wouldn't say I know any of them. It's not about number of languages, it's mastery of concepts. Like I learned about async await in c#, but that experience is applicable to basically any language that does that async await pattern. Don't worry about knowing your languages' standard library inside and out, worry about knowing how to build things and make them work. The rest is just fluff you can pickup or Google on the way."
ProgrammerHumor,ffaf9ny,t1_ff8u6nl,1579734361.0,I'm gonna piggy back this and suggest OP go read the catb hackers dictionary. Some of the stories and definitions in that thing can really help drive this point home.
dndmemes,ffa5h98,t1_ffa3o3a,1579728267.0,"I have a PC of my own that achieved an epic destiny. His library lies in wait, he's a wan shi-tong type spirit of intellect now. I can't wait for the players to meet him."

dndmemes,ff81u9q,t1_ff7wfu2,1579663781.0,"Hah, that's fair. Sometimes I have to restrain myself from just diving through wiki pages cause while I don't mind spoilers, I don't want to know \_everything\_ before I read it."

I love Alice, but this right here feels like exactly what's going to happen. Honestly, at this point, I just want her to be happy again. She's been so miserable for so long, and sure, some of it is self inflicted, but still..."

Overwatch,fej1hxg,t1_feinfsa,1579153509.0,"The problem is, it's basically impossible to prevent these type of bugs in video games.

And I don't think Alice is doing necromancy, at least not yet, I think she's just making a really really accurate golem.

Flutter isn't actually explicitly for building apps, it's for building widgets, hence everything is a widget, it's completely possible to mix your Flutter ui into a UIKit layout, it's called Flutter view embedding or something like that."
