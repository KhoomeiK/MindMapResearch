AskReddit,fe6t1t9,t3_enu36l,1578904072.0,"I fucked pancakes

I was suffering a period of touch deprivation. I was dying for the warm cuddles in bed again. It had only been four months since I brought my ex back across the country to her home, but the loneliness was killing me.

One day, I was microwaving some pancakes I recently made. I suck at making pancakes- I just can't figure out how to make them right. The ones I made this time came out thick and leathery, but because I didn't want to waste them I figured I'd eat them.

When I pulled them out of the microwave, I noticed how much they felt like a person's flesh. They felt warm, and they're leathery quality gave them a texture not unlike skin. I suddenly had a horrible idea. 

No one was home. It was just me, myself, I, and two pancakes on a plate. I decided to go through with my idea. 

I dropped my pants while I was on the couch, and wrapped my two warm pancakes over my already erect plaything. I beat not just my breakfast sausage, but my pancakes as well. The more I got into it, the more the crumbs flew. I tore those pancakes a new one. Within a few minutes, I spread my frosting all over those sad, sad pancakes.

I felt pretty guilty afterwards. I just wasted two mediocre pancakes to try and stave off my deep feelings of loneliness. I made sure to clean the crumbs up thoroughly and tossed the pancakes in the trash, where no one would see them. I skipped lunch that day because I wasted that one meal."
AmazonFC,fe3u1om,t1_fe3nxck,1578852871.0,That’s a total of 24 days say they worked at minimum 4 shifts a week. That’s 40 hours in a week. Up to 120 hours...maybe some pto but not all. It could’ve also been paid leave.
