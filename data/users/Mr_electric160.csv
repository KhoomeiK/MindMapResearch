facepalm,fczhwme,t1_fcza1tg,1578101622.0,"No not really, cause while yes ATGMs are a massive threat on the modern battlefield to Tanks, they are no longer a new threat and countermeasures have been developed to while not completely counter them do diminish their effectiveness. That and they have a number of disadvantages compared to tanks, they are quite heavy and bulky making it difficult for infantry to tote around, while they might be easier to hiade due to their small size they don't have as good of sensors as tanks do, the counter measures for them are quite light and easier to implement on equipment (I.E. things like smoke, Point defense, and jammer) Compared to things like say the heavy armor it takes to counter other tanks, and they have less utility then tanks do (I.E. The missiles are too expensive to do anything but kill Vehicles). Tanks are not obsolete, especially when you consider that most modern tanks are frontally fairly impervious to most other threats they may face. Overall ATGMs are only a little more effective then the anti-tank gun of the late 30s and earlier ww2 against the tanks of the time."
