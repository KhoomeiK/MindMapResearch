funny,ffc6wq2,t1_ffbwy4h,1579792936.0,Same here. I use white towels because a lot of my face washes / lotions will bleach other colors of towels. So I’d rather use a white towel that might get makeup stains on it that can be washed out rather than bleach a pretty colored towel and have it be irreversible.
funny,ffc6kgg,t1_ffb7bw2,1579792712.0,White can be bleached. Most women I know (and myself) use white towels because I can bleach my white towels. And my face wash / lotion has salicylic acid which would leach the color out of towels so I specifically avoid using colored towels after washing my face.
funny,ffc6enq,t1_ffba3rv,1579792609.0,Exactly. Especially because my face wash has salicylic acid in it which bleaches any other color anyway.
AnimalsBeingDerps,ffc67r3,t1_ffc38ag,1579792479.0,This is true. Unless you have a dog and can’t be bothered to pick your $200 shoes up off the floor
AmItheAsshole,ffa8tpi,t1_ff9x8pg,1579730125.0,It’s just as wrong to say all women would regret having children as it is to say all women want children. People are individuals and everyone finds different ways to be fulfilled and happy in life.
AnimalsBeingDerps,ffa10xk,t1_ff9xx6i,1579725718.0,"They have teeth. And super mild venom. Their fangs are in the back of their mouths (rear fanged) so they sort of.... chew. They grab whatever they want to eat (they naturally hunt frogs and toads most of the time) and gnaw on it until they get their rear teeth into it. Their venom is inconsequential for humans (mostly, some people have allergic reactions to it) but will do the trick for a little frog. 

It makes them hilarious to tong feed. My ball python strikes and wraps the mouse / rat like you’d expect a snake to do. My hognose sort of just starts chewing on the mouse. It’s cute."
AnimalsBeingDerps,ff9bp8i,t1_ff96c13,1579709311.0,"They need something rough to start a shed. That’s why you need to have something with a rough surface (like a rock or branch) in every snake’s enclosure. Once it’s started they can slide out of their old skin like a sock, it’s super cool."
AnimalsBeingDerps,ff92pyb,t1_ff8si8f,1579703392.0,Nah. Hognose snakes aren’t constrictors (meaning they don’t squeeze their prey). So he’s just cruising around. They’re pretty inquisitive little critters.
