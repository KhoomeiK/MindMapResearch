UpliftingNews,ff87jr3,t1_ff6uqkh,1579668249.0,There were a lot of minorities there. It's not surprising really. The bills they were trying to pass and ultimately threw out would have made most gun owners felons overnight.

liberalgunowners,fcumybm,t1_fcuaka0,1577984453.0,There's a lot of comments now that I have posted this. There wasn't any beforehand. This really needs to pick up some momentum. Someone is doing time for this.

liberalgunowners,fcs8xqw,t1_fcs8vt0,1577913125.0,Yup. Better get rid of your BB guns.
liberalgunowners,fcruqeg,t1_fcru3yy,1577906872.0,I remember that. That's some BS.

liberalgunowners,fcrnvjb,t1_fcrnozx,1577904273.0,"I spotted that. It's still BS though. Even if airguns are like illegal, that's some BS.

liberalgunowners,fcpfwnn,t1_fcpfrba,1577862204.0,That's what I'm saying. The comments on twitter are eating it up. We need to enlighten them.
gunpolitics,fcpfkjb,t1_fcpfj9c,1577861788.0,Maybe the pistols? There's rounds in the ziploc it looks like.

HumansAreMetal,fcow1ls,t1_fcovtx4,1577843131.0,"Ya, buddy tell that to the 2016 rigged primaries.

More guns do not give us freedom but taking away the law abiding citizens rights only empowers the corrupt and the lawless. Why you bring this up for your point doesn't help it. We're talking about the freedom index."
HumansAreMetal,fcov68x,t1_fcouvjl,1577842445.0,"Well, your reasoning is wrong. It has nothing to do with guns. Our government is obviously more corrupt and our election process might as well be rigged. Our checks and balances are not doing their job where as other free nations obviously are."
HumansAreMetal,fcop786,t1_fcn0rqt,1577837908.0,"You don't need 6 months training for that. More like a couple weeks if you did it every day. Honestly, if instead offered incentives to being trained, it would better. No rights infringed, there's more incentive to carry, no ridiculous waiting periods."
HumansAreMetal,fconnsk,t1_fcni8pq,1577836778.0,That probably has nothing to do with guns though.

Make sure you have your fundamentals down first though."
todayilearned,fcl2wir,t1_fcl2sa9,1577738635.0,AK? They have adjustment tools for them.
politics,fcl2u12,t1_fcl2nbt,1577738592.0,I'm seeing conflicting information. Most I've read was 2 dead (1 being the shooter) and 1 wounded (later died). Other info said it was the shooter who was wounded. Idk.
todayilearned,fckyhmv,t1_fckk097,1577735910.0,"If you're grouping well, your shooting technique is good. You then make adjustments to your sighta/optic whatever to move your group to where you want it. Shoot again to confirm."
politics,fckwmnm,t1_fckmzw1,1577734777.0,1 was the shooter himself.
news,fckveba,t1_fckulvf,1577734022.0,I have enjoyed it as well. I will look into that.
news,fckc80r,t1_fcjlhol,1577722055.0,"The issues with 5.56 have a lot to do with poor decisions the army decided on, such as barrel twist rate and not testing m855 thoroughly enough. Out of a 20"" barrel, m855 performed as expected (it needed the velocity to perform). When the M4 became standard across the services, M855's weaknesses started showing. Supposedly, the newer M855A1 fixed most of the issues with it.

I'm on the side of the aisle that believes the issues with the M16/M4 and 5.56 are a training issue more than hardware. Basic Rifle Marksmanship training, at least for the army, is a joke but they are changing things. I remember countless times being told not to shoot the 300m target and save those 4 rounds for anything else because you can miss 4 targets and still qualify as Expert. 

Listening to Special Forces guys talk about how they hate 7.62 NATO as a main weapon has opened my eyes on it. It has its purpose as a medium machine gun round or DMR but even those are going away. 6.5 Creedmoor is making an appearance for the DMR role, 300 Win Mag is actually bejng used in sniper rifles, and I've seen testing a .338 Norma Mag machine gun. I heard one guy say with the 6.5 Creedmoor, your ""Carlos Hathcock skills can go out the window."" Lol

I don't think the 5.56 is going anywhere until a major leap in weapons technology occurs.

If you like to listen to podcasts, check out Primary & Secondary, the Gun Nerd episodes. They have long-form panel discussions on the topic that are really informative. A lot of times, one special forces guy will dominate the conversation but he does have a lot to say on the matter."
news,fcjhohb,t1_fcjhciy,1577687982.0,"That is a good point. I wonder how much of that is psychology of fear? Back then, getting shot with a 44 lead ball could mean death without care and possibly even with care. Now, with modern medicine, our chances of survival are much higher. I wonder how much of this played a role in combat?"
news,fcjgixs,t1_fcjg50b,1577686765.0,"I've considered the 43X but I actually really like the 48. I figured slide length doesn't matter too much since it would be IWB. Either way, I think most of my light and holster fit it as well. I'm probably going to wait for the period Glock sells blue labels to veterans again though. 

Lol will do."
news,fcjftgy,t1_fcjfgqz,1577686030.0,"That's what I like about the Hi Power. You can buy new CZ75's and they have a ton of different models these days. I can never decide on one I like more. I don't think I'll ever buy a surplus gun again after getting a CZ82. It's just disappointing that it doesn't feel like a new gun. I could restore I guess but I have other projects I'm working on.

Personally, I just dislike full-size pistols with 8 or less rounds. I prefer 9mm as shot placement and quick follow-up shots are more important, imo. I don't care for the grip safety but that is minor. I caved and carry a glock 43 with 6 rounds so I can't complain too much. I want to upgrade soon."
news,fcjf0f7,t1_fcjercr,1577685235.0,"I don't have hands-on experience but I would want a Hi Power over a 1911. I've wanted one for quite a while. I've been considering a CZ-75, mostly because it's a Hi Power knockoff that's proven and affordable. 

Honestly, if the Hudson H9 were developed more and affordable, I would want one of them. Very interesting piece. Too bad they went out of business but that's what happens when you overprice things."
CombatFootage,fcjeakt,t1_fcjby0m,1577684556.0,I think they just extended it again. Read they are getting new wings to extend their service life.
news,fcjakzc,t1_fcipsjt,1577681435.0,"I always talked a lot of shit about 1911's, being that there are much more modern options out there (still true). Then I finally got my hands on one and well, I ate my words. 

I still think they are outdated for carrying but they are definitely decent shooters."

AskReddit,fc2m2kd,t3_efqzp6,1577366641.0,"I work on a boat and I'm away from home this year for Christmas. I work with a guy who thinks he's got way more authority than be does. Several times this trip, he's inserted himself into my business and I got fed up with it.

2 weeks ago, I requested off early just before the new year. He's acted like its his place to find out who my relief will be since I put in for it. He's not the Captain and he's not the dispatcher, so it's none of his damn business. Christmas Eve night, he kept bringing it up and I told him keep his nose where it belongs and out of my goddamn business. We got into a little more, basically back and forth with the same thing before the Mate put a stop to it. Woke up Christmas morning to him bitching about it to another deckhand. Pretty much ruined my mood for the day. We barely speak which makes working together difficult. Luckily, its the slowest time of year and we are doing too much.

The guy isn't well liked for being a douche and overall shitty human being."
