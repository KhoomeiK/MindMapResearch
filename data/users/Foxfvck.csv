classicwow,fffbw9s,t1_fffax1r,1579880558.0,I mean I do the basic sit down stretches but that’s about it. It sucks to start but just knowing you are being healthy while doing it is good motivation. Also don’t be afraid to walk to catch your breath. You’ll end up burning out by being stubborn and actually get less of a workout lol

classicwow,fff308f,t1_ffegvk4,1579874325.0,Dude the compression sleeves that people put on their knees are game changers. They really work like a dream. I always suggest wearing leg tights as well. They help with compression and they make your shirts not rub anything raw

classicwow,ffchv2t,t3_esvx3c,1579799794.0,2 hours and 45 minutes to down ony and MC seems like the dps is lacking a little bit but y’all should be fine as long as you don’t mind falling behind the pack. It’s okay to be casual as long as your guild is casual

classicwow,ffcak11,t3_esv0ej,1579795262.0,"If you are primarily farming, bloodvine isn’t what you want. It’s great for raiding because of the hit and the crit it gives. (Great for warlocks) it is somewhat still squishy so your farming will take some hits."

You don’t wanna keep torturing yourself and then down the road after all the extra time you spent could have went towards other things if you quit. Not to mention the gear you accumulated could have went to others that wanted it and stayed.

classicwow,fen55ls,t1_fen4z0f,1579277196.0,"When he said he doesn’t play much during the week, I assume he raid logs and it’s more of a casual guild. I wouldn’t expect a casual guild to REQUIRE arcane to clear MC"
classicwow,fen4kqa,t1_fen2gff,1579276829.0,"The AV grind sucks but the hands will make arcane farming easier. It’s not mandatory but it will make things more forgiving. When phase four drops, change to frost spec for the rep and may farming in ZG as a mage in the early weeks. It’s a goldmine and definitely worth. There’s a few videos on how to do it. Unless you are horde sulfuras then don’t do it... I don’t want competition lol best of luck to ya!"
classicwow,fen2a5k,t1_femz4g4,1579275375.0,"Just opt to be the winter chill mage and rake in the money. I think money for consumables is probably more important than learning to press arcane power off cool down. I guess is makes you learn your positioning better because of less survivability. The only learning that needs to be done really is the PoM to get that last frostbolt off. If you do stay arcane, try and get to blood guard for the pvp hands. They give you a bigger mana shield!"
