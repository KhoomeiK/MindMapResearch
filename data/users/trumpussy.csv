 - driver smokes

 - If car is full of 3 or more adults of the same race, they never smile, and you better not be out after dark.
 - Pistol under passenger seat
 - disgusting car trees hanging from the mirror
 - gawdy aftermarket wheels
 - Always two police cars behind the one that gets pulled over.
 - Seedy neighborhood
 - Some kind of sticker on the back window that says something like a monster logo, thug life, rap cd logo, I hate pigs, etc.
 - Stolen amazon boxes, dead hooker or something in the trunk.
 - Harder, more harmful, drugs  in glove box like meth, heroin, etc."

I've heard windoze bundled ads into their latest OS, but haven't actually investigated where and what.  I know they put spyware/malware in their OS, and that doesn't bode well with me.

Steam,fc5vvbg,t1_fc5tx2h,1577467004.0,"The only way I know of it happening legitimately is the VAC authentication servers being blocked by a firewall at some point, or your IP address changing, mid game-session.  People make cheats to postpone the authentication, but it can only go so long before you get the boot.  During that time, they can use cheats with no risk of VAC."
Steam,fc5uo9z,t1_fc5snwt,1577466289.0,"I get the reasoning for it.  It's better to have the false positive rate nonexistent, or really close to it, and let some go free, then to have lots of people unfairly tagged.

Especially since VAC is such a non-transparent system.  In order to maintain trust of everybody using it, they can't have too many false positives.  I never liked the idea much of having someone with the power to ruin someone's account without giving proof, but, I can see the arguments for it as you don't want cheaters to know exactly what or why they got caught so they can evolve better cheats."
