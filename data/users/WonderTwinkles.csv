offmychest,ffqi73a,t1_ffqhnrm,1580135296.0,"Okay, you need to go see your general practitioner doctor, the one you see for physicals. Tell him/her what happened and ask them for advice  or a referral to proper trauma-related mental health professionals. 

You need to consider this problem the same way as you would a broken leg. You wouldn't just sit at home and try to splint it yourself, you'd get out to a professional. 

The sooner you do this, the sooner you get better, the sooner you don't have to deal with people. Think of it like that. A means to an end to return to your life."
offmychest,ffqh50l,t3_euocor,1580134444.0,"You need to talk to a professional counselor. You are trying to deal with legit trauma on your own and you aren't equipped to do it. 

Please reach out to your doctor and see if they can refer you to proper mental health professionals."
offmychest,ffqduwb,t3_eunu7b,1580131599.0,"I'm not going to tell you if you should or shouldn't end your life. That's for you to decide.

I will tell you that you should break up with your GF. You are setting her up to experience widowhood, even if you do not marry. And that is cruel.

If there is enough time between you breaking up with her, and you deciding to exit life, it will not hit her as hard. 

Consider it."

That is unfair. You are not even trying to give her a chance to find a way to pay more. No family of five with one disabled kid is going to find a new place to live in 30 days.

offmychest,fff8tfd,t1_fff8hll,1579878567.0,"Okay, now this is important:

Grief is like being lost at sea. You will sometimes be buffeted by waves, and other times will be floating calmly. It cycles. And this can go on for years and it's OKAY TO FEEL THIS. Don't feel like you have to get over it. 

Right now is the very worst you will ever feel. The stinging pain, the immediate loss, sometimes periods of numbness. It just sucks. 

But, it's like a plucked guitar string. Right now, the vibrations are the most strong. Right now, the emotional swings are the highest to the lowest. Right now, is the worst it will ever be.

Over time, the vibrations will lessen. Over time, you will be happy again about things, which doesn't take anything away from your mother or your loss. So don't feel guilty when you find yourself laughing at something. 

Time is your friend. You just can't hurry the process."
