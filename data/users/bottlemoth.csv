illnessfakersgonewild,femflax,t3_epw3wy,1579252924.0,The thought of taking a puppy who’s been on a 15 hour non stop car ride into a 7 hour appointment is just nuts. He is not trained. He is not brushed and he looks matted. He was not set up for success beforehand with training and exercise. She even said he was acting bad. Why would you bring him?
apexlegends,feig6hl,t3_ep6lqh,1579137770.0,Kraber is basically a brick in my hands. I just can’t get the hang of it
bestoflegaladvice,feelblu,t1_fe8xfao,1579036071.0,"It doesn’t matter if it’s on the dog or not. It’s not acceptable for a dog to bite someone, and it’s not acceptable for a dog to run around unsecured while you’re expecting something to be delivered. If you really cared about your dog like it was your own child, you’d keep it from biting someone so that it doesn’t have to be put down."
illnessfakersgonewild,fe0c5pq,t1_fe0b2r5,1578809398.0,"Just wanted to add that it’s not possible that she trained heeling reliably with a puppy in this short amount of time. Heeling takes FOREVER to teach and proof under distractions. Her dog is like 4 months old, too."
illnessfakersgonewild,fe0b2r5,t3_en1g2t,1578808321.0,"Could just be the camera flipping the photo but that slip lead looks wrong to me. A slip lead or choke chain should always be placed in a letter P shape with the dog positioned on your left hand side, otherwise it’ll tighten indefinitely. You can strangle or severely injure a dog with a backwards choke chain or slip lead. Not to mention the fact that the overall safety and effectiveness of a slip lead or choker type collar is highly debated, especially on puppies."
dogs,fdpz7x1,t3_emkwgv,1578646996.0,"I would just be careful. Shepherds are not easy dogs, and they’re not first time dogs. They also tend to be pretty high in prey drive and don’t get along with cats. Even when your dog does you shouldn’t leave them at home alone together. They tend to be reactive and the breed as a whole is prone to human/dog aggression. A mutt who was probably on the streets was not going to be well socialized or bred for temperament. You might luck out, but what you’re really getting is a mixed bag and you need to be prepared for that. Their natural predisposal to aggression and their protective nature means responsible owners need to train, socialize, and handle their dog appropriately.

They are a working breed. They need a lot of exercise and mental stimulation. Their brains are constantly running and they like to get into trouble when bored. From harassing you, causing mayhem, destroying or chewing stuff, if you don’t meet their needs they’ll meet them themselves by being bad. But with responsible ownership they are excellent dogs. I think just not for everyone. They are extremely loyal and love hard. They just need the type of person that can handle their drive and personality."
Dogfree,fdhuqvv,t3_ek5dbh,1578430497.0,It made teeth contact? You might need a rabies shot.
Dogfree,fdhu4lu,t3_ekb4eq,1578430187.0,"Your dog is not well trained. To live with a dog takes a lot of training, time, and management. If you can’t handle that then there’s no shame in not owning a dog. What breed is it?"
fatlogic,fdct16k,t3_ejqz4h,1578283494.0,Everyone wants to doubt what a doctor says but the moment they get sick they’re always sitting in that ER or doctors office waiting for antibiotics. If you really think they’re lying why would you take the medicine they give you? Why are you even going to the doctor?
fatlogic,fdcsts3,t3_ejyf93,1578283329.0,It’s a sign of “needs better coping skills.”
fatlogic,fdcqjbb,t3_ekd3yk,1578281536.0,A thing a lot of people like this don’t realize is you are the ONLY person who can help yourself. No one else can come fix your mental health for you. So when you’re contemplating suicide over body issues...it’s not the rest of the world. It’s a problem with YOU that you should seek help for. No one can do it for you. Getting better is a process only you can start for yourself.
illnessfakersgonewild,fdbnj2s,t1_fd9qhhh,1578259143.0,You get it. A ton of people don’t understand breeding for color is a bad thing.
illnessfakersgonewild,fd7o3ju,t3_ek8bcv,1578207459.0,English cream is a backyard breeding scam. Breeding for certain colors is a sign your breeder isn’t a good one...wonder where she got it?
illnessfakersgonewild,fd4hv9v,t1_fczml9d,1578167611.0,Working dogs love their jobs. Too bad it has to be wasted on people who are doing this though.
fatlogic,fcvwgvf,t3_ej6o9x,1578011660.0,Momentary discomfort is not that big of a deal.
reactivedogs,fcv9hdn,t3_ej2mjg,1577997436.0,"Not everyone can handle every dog. If it’s at the point your whole life revolves around him then you’ve got to think about what’s good for you. If you go through with giving him away breed specific rescues or someone who lives on a farm might be a good fit for him. Some dogs aren’t cut out to be city dogs, and they’re happier away from the world on a farm."
Dogtraining,fcv6j94,t1_fcuhatj,1577995675.0,"I absolutely couldn’t believe it. I could train him to ignore the cooing and drive by petting, but there’s no training you can do to get people to stop picking him up. He’s a very small yorkie, so I guess that has something to do with it."
Dogtraining,fctukdf,t3_eisqsr,1577960286.0,"A do not pet vest worked great for me. On amazon you can find patches in black and red that say “do not distract, do not pet” with a stop sign in the middle. Very visible and clear and keeps people well away from the dog. People kept picking up my yorkie from behind me (without me even looking!) which is why I got one."
illnessfakersgonewild,fctudj9,t3_einwf7,1577960006.0,Getting close to someone isn’t a task. My dog sticks her head right next to my face when she wants to go pee. Not sure how it helps anyone but the dog
illnessfakersgonewild,fcttzcm,t3_eis08i,1577959418.0,"This just isn’t true. Some dogs sense something being wrong naturally, (rare also but let’s not get into that) but they still need to have that trained and shaped into an actual reliable alert. Magical alerts don’t happen without training. And owner raising doesn’t change the bond for anyone but you...program service dogs also spend their time with their handler 24/7 and they form a bond just a deeply as an owner raised dog would. That would be like saying shelter dogs can’t love you as much because you didn’t own them first. They’re capable of loving more than one person more than one time."
Dogtraining,fctrw5g,t3_eisajl,1577956298.0,"Are his mental stimulation needs being met? Pits are a working breed of dog, and like other working breeds need to be worked or they will start breaking stuff. Learning new tricks, working on obedience, doing stuff like rally-o, agility, retrieval training, or nosework are all things that can be fun to do and keep that brain busy. Something that could also help is leaving a stuffed kong while you’re away. My GSD is the same way. When her needs aren’t met she finds her own way to meet them, and that’s either causing trouble or harassing you until she gets what she’s looking for."
reactivedogs,fco2j1a,t1_fcn42kb,1577822867.0,Was he not muzzled in the car or on the hike either?
dogs,fco25g3,t1_fcmx0m2,1577822693.0,That dog looks like it has a medium length double coat. OP I would use a slicker brush and a shedding rake or furminator. Maybe a greyhound comb for the back thigh area and tail.
dogs,fco1wnm,t1_fcn11s1,1577822577.0,"Super glad that it doesn’t match the symptoms for him, pets having strokes is an awful experience. Good luck on his health!"
dogs,fcmtixf,t3_ehzc73,1577791536.0,"I am NOT A VET, but the sideways walk sounds kind of like a stroke to me? Not sure if dogs can even have strokes, but it’s kind of weird the vet wouldn’t acknowledge that because in my opinion it’s the most alarming symptom. A pet I had started doing this exact thing and passed away from a stroke."
dogs,fcmoy1c,t3_ehsbpo,1577784997.0,"I think a golden would be a better fit, especially since you have cats. I love my german shepherd but she was not and is not an easy dog. They are just something else. I have no other way to describe it other then very intense. You should be familiar with that since you grew up around them. I think for your first dog together you’ll want something more biddable. 

Edit: I noticed you said you had social anxiety and you think having a GSD would help with that. However, with how in tune they are they tend to feed off of handler anxiety and amp themselves up. Minor stuff didn’t affect my GSD, but my major anxiety moments made her anxious too, and she would be worse because of that (putting it gently). On top of this, their protective nature makes them way more likely to be reactive or aggressive, and that can make one more anxious."
dogs,fcmo64o,t3_ehz5uj,1577783899.0,"Your imgur link is broken. Curly hair or straight hair? Or something like a wire coat? I can help with long silky straight hair, or double shedding coats."
dogs,fcmo38k,t3_ehzjt7,1577783785.0,"Wow, that’s one interesting mix. I’ve never seen a dog who looks like that. Very cute!"
dogs,fcmnqep,t3_ehyv2z,1577783290.0,"My purebred GSD has the same type of flabby neck, doesn’t mean that he’s half sharpei. He looks full GSD to me, except for the rounded ears. Maybe a dash of chow? Just guessing based on the shape of the ears."
reactivedogs,fcm3r8f,t1_fcllbvz,1577763467.0,"I’m sorry, how did your dog bite him if he’s always muzzled on walks? Just confused about the post"
DoggyDNA,fcl7awm,t3_ehpftv,1577741356.0,I think he looks kinda like a lhasa apso with short hair! Super cute
reactivedogs,fckwdm5,t3_eh141f,1577734624.0,"This dog sounds less reactive and more scarily aggressive. You just got him and he’s already attempted to bite someone. He could be a liability. The breed is a powerful serious breed and you need to be careful- he will go through with he’s telling you, and he’s telling you he’s going to bite someone. It might be time to reconsider your ownership of a dog like this."
illnessfakers,fcd4584,t1_fccum7r,1577606126.0,That’s one of the responsible ways to do it
illnessfakers,fcby4na,t1_fca798j,1577592267.0,I’ve never understood the instagram trend of long distance downs and out of sight downs in public stores. Your dog laying somewhere fifty feet away or out of sight= not in your control. What happens if it starts walking off? Your dog isn’t helping you with your disability if it’s two aisles away.
illnessfakers,fcakjya,t3_egvh85,1577571016.0,You should set your dog up for success. If your dog is not going to be successful off leash don’t let them off leash. Service dogs are held to the absolute highest standard. Failing to uphold this standard in a public area is unacceptable.
AmItheAsshole,fbzy524,t3_ef5uma,1577268060.0,NTA If it’s not task trained for a disabled handler it’s not legally protected as a service dog. By bringing it in these public places it’s causing a health code violation and you are breaking the law by misrepresentation of a service animal. Your mom could get in big trouble for that...
apexlegends,fbytr2m,t1_fbxeu84,1577226100.0,Will try thanks
apexlegends,fbytq9g,t1_fbxd529,1577226082.0,I brought the deadzone all the way up and changed the response curve. That nearly fixed it but I’m still having issues at the end of the match. Thanks for responding
awfuleverything,fbv9y8l,t1_fbt2w98,1577127763.0,"Majority well bred, genetic tested GSDs are fine. Show dogs who are bred for the extreme slope are not. Some show dogs that aren’t bred for extreme slope are fine too. The purpose of a GSD is to do a job and they can’t do that if they’re so deformed that they can’t run or walk."
