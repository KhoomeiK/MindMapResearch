worldnews,feq9mpv,t1_feq6ls1,1579339175.0,"> there is literally no societal pressure to do so

Firstly, this is an overstatement on the Japanese part. Secondly, societal pressure to have sex is decreasing in the West as well. Sexual freedom also means the freedom to not have sex. [And people *are* having less sex.](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/12/the-sex-recession/573949/) Pressure to have children also declines from generation to generation. While a lot of boomers might still look at you weird (or worse) if you say you don't want children, a lot of millennials don't want to have children themselves and are very accepting of the idea. Zoomers are not yet in the age group to have children, but a lot of them are also against the idea of having children because they feel they couldn't afford to have them because it's increasingly harder to raise children.

> People can live with their parents basically forever

A lot of young people in their West are living with their parents for longer and longer times because they simply cannot afford to move out, especially in the big cities. 

> can abstain and there is no reason to lie about how often you do it

Again, with greater sexual freedom also comes the freedom to be asexual/less sexual and as per the article linked above, people are definitely making use of that freedom."

Oftentimes every store then just leaves it at that price, I rarely see price differences for the same book. 

So basically, we don't have to make that choice. Bookstores are pretty much the better option and they're very widespread here. You want a book and they don't have it? Order it from the book store and pick it up the next day, faster than Amazon."
