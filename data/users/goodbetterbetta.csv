OCD,ff1ou69,t1_ff1o1s2,1579482874.0,"It sounds to me like you're possibly developing OCD and I highly recommend speaking with a doctor or trained professional as soon as you can. You want to stay ahead of your symptoms before it develops and gets worse. That being said, it might just be a quirk you have and nothing to worry about. So I would definitely speak to a professional about your concerns."

OCD,ff1mpqx,t3_er3jo0,1579481731.0,"Not a doctor or psychologist. But I have diagnosed OCD and have been living with it for nearly a decade. This behaviour definitely sounds like a characteristic of OCD. If you don't get to rewatch or reread, does it feel like something bad will happen to you or someone you care for? This happened a lot with me personally before I was successfully diagnosed and treated. I'd talk to a doctor or trained professional about this behaviour, but remember just because you have one characteristic of OCD doesn't mean you have the disorder; it has to disrupt your everyday life."

AskReddit,ff14v4k,t3_er3wum,1579475202.0,I have obsessive compulsive disorder which results in pretty frequent panic attacks. I'm successfully controlling my OCD with medication but anxiety is still an issue. If I feel a panic attack coming on or if I'm already having one I put two fingers on the pulse on my neck and count the beats. Sometimes if it's really bad I'll close my eyes and try to slow down my heart rate with deep breaths while counting. It never fails to ground me and calm me down.

plantclinic,feye8i0,t1_feycjkr,1579444281.0,"I've never seen them in that color (I've only seen green and peach) but I think those are just aphids. Thankfully it's easily treated if you act quickly and don't let it get any worse! If you're able, go to any plant supply store like Home Depot and pick up some insecticidal soap. Follow the directions and spray directly onto the bugs. I recommend wiping them away with a paper towel afterwards to clean off extra soap and bug carcass."
plantclinic,feycr67,t3_eqwsuh,1579443842.0,Those definitely look like a bug infestation to me when you zoom in. It's hard to tell but possibly aphids. I'd recommend an insecticidal soap ASAP!

TrueOffMyChest,fclbm79,t1_fcl9p9g,1577744071.0,"Sexual harrasment in the cannabis industry is actually a common complaint and makes the news pretty often. Mine is a small example of the problem I wanted to share. It's not the friendly 420 atmosphere you'd think working in weed is, there's a certain kind of asshole attracted to the job and they move quickly up by who you know, not what you know. They listen to Snoop Dogg and Biggie while throwing around the N word, harrasing and openly discriminating against people of color. I heard the manager laugh that they could never hire a trans person, even when they were fully qualified and very nice. He called the person ""it"" and a ""hermaphrodite"" right after shaking the trans person's hand and telling them he'll call after the interview. I could go on for days."

I put up holiday decorations for businesses during the season, so I went in early on a weekday figuring no one would be there. Wrong. These people aren't there for a bachelor party or an impromptu wedding, they're there because they're gambling addicts and they can't stop funneling what little they have of their hard-earned money into the glowing machines. It's so sad."

She has sensitive skin and the fur rubs off under traditional collars (even if they're not tight) so I thought this would be a good alternative, but thanks to your comment it will be just for walkies! We might try a Paracord collar or a breakaway chainlink instead just for identification purposes around the house."
