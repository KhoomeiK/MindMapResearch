VoteBlue,ffelmqh,t1_ffdtc7c,1579853300.0,Beto BURIED his political future (especially in TX) when he said live on the debate stage he’d confiscate firearms.
JoeRogan,ffelgob,t1_ffel6ga,1579853078.0,"The polls were correct. People act like the polls were giving her a 100% chance of victory but the actual polls gave Clinton an 80% chance of winning.

He’s a democratic socialist which is more similar to Scandinavia. Capitalism with strong welfare system"
JoeRogan,ffek57z,t1_ffei3lw,1579851378.0,A) Sanders isn’t a socialist. B) EVERY single poll has Sanders beating Trump by a wider margin than literally any other candidate
beholdthemasterrace,ffb9amc,t1_ffb6hdt,1579755900.0,Go ahead and clarify then cause this pic definitely doesn’t fit

assholedesign,ffadevc,t1_ffacpj5,1579732929.0,"I thought you meant three out of the four times you got chicken it smelled like that. Yeah that’s super gross. I’ve never had a bad experience with their meat but I have gotten fucked up vegetables from them as well. 

Definitely not worth $20+ a meal but pretty decent when they have the 50% offers I suppose."
assholedesign,ffacapk,t1_ffa4tjz,1579732164.0,"Just for the future, cryovac chicken usually smells sulfury and can be mistaken for being bad. Opening it and letting it air for 10 minutes makes the smell go away"
assholedesign,ffac10o,t1_ffa3s0f,1579731981.0,He didn’t say it didn’t have a purpose. He said it would be the worst type of job for a call center employee to have. Just because someone is in default and in the wrong doesn’t mean they won’t be a complete dickhead to you for calling them.
ToiletPaperUSA,ff6ajvn,t1_ff68tzg,1579622957.0,"You mean his doctor wife, Dr Shapiro who is a doctor?"

Badfaketexts,fem5wxx,t3_eppd1k,1579240886.0,I usually can’t stand the complaining about reposts but this is ridiculous. This shitty image has literally been posted here every week for the past year. Useless mods.
entertainment,fem2ts2,t1_felz41x,1579237900.0,His name’s ASAC Schrader and you can go fuck yourself
entertainment,fem2s92,t1_felowqp,1579237862.0,I get what you’re saying but I’d rather wait and have something amazing as opposed to rushed and shitty
cringe,fem29ce,t1_fem169w,1579237383.0,"Absolutely. Not long ago Warren was my 2nd top pick after Bernie but after this debate and finding out what else she’s lied about, I can see Trump destroying her on the debate stage. What a snake."

SandersForPresident,feikyo3,t1_feihw9o,1579140954.0,Who do you think gave the story to CNN? I don’t buy for a second Warren didn’t know. She had a speech ready to go for the debate question last night

AlternateAngles,fei1tbx,t1_feh9lk6,1579128423.0,"A) what does that even mean?

politics,fefqpvk,t1_fefptzv,1579062476.0,Right... which is why I said *actual* fake news for emphasis. Nothing gets past you
politics,fefqgxy,t1_fefq8tp,1579062292.0,Same thing Clinton tried doing as well. I still remember her supporters attacking Susan Sarandon for endorsing Bernie when she was “supposed to support a female candidate”
politics,fefq8qq,t1_fefq676,1579062118.0,They usually get uploaded to YouTube by someone in the next day
politics,fefpzn6,t1_fefpr4x,1579061929.0,I wouldn’t be surprised if she inferred something incorrectly and realized she could use it as ammo. Pretty weird the story broke right before the debate about something that allegedly happened 2 years ago
politics,fefpsll,t3_eowodh,1579061783.0,Fucking pathetic that CNN is pushing the claim that Bernie said a woman can’t be president. He denies it and they keep saying it as the truth. Actual fake news.
politics,fefmr6y,t1_fefmngp,1579059696.0,I hope it’s obvious to undecided voters as well and they don’t fall for the bullshit hit job
politics,fefjfcr,t3_eousl5,1579057586.0,"Ok seriously, wtf is going on with her eyebrow"

InfowarriorRides,fdk6n4z,t1_fdjx261,1578497280.0,"SE Michigan as well. Been seeing a LOT of thin blue line flags lately. But on the bright side, lots of Bernie stickers too"

worldnews,fdk4zhx,t1_fdk3s74,1578496179.0,So everyone needs to “wait and see” except for you apparently. I looked at your comment history and you’ve said the same thing about ten different times. Transparent as fuck you are.
PoliticalHumor,fdgpjma,t1_fdgpabh,1578404903.0,"He didn’t draft dodge for moral reasons. He used daddy’s money to pay off a doctor to fabricate medical records because he was scared. With his lie, someone else was forced to go instead."
facepalm,fd0661n,t1_fd04xip,1578114214.0,"I think Chris Murphy, senator from Connecticut sums it up best:

“Soleimani was an enemy of the United States. That’s not a question.

The question is this - as reports suggest, did America just assassinate, without any congressional authorization, the second most powerful person in Iran, knowingly setting off a potential massive regional war?”"
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fd03e0l,t1_fcyh5lr,1578113038.0,How wealthy could she possibly be even? She was in a handful of so-so movies a long ass time ago

CastleRockTV,fbtsa7a,t3_eegq5a,1577093126.0,It’s crazy seeing her in something like Party Down and then this. Tbh I’m surprised she never broke into bigger roles because she really is a phenomenal actor
