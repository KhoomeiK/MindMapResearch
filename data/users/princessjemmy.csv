They would rather have Mac and cheese from a box. Like, they straight out said it. 

That said, my husband at least had the decency to be appalled at them. I was briefly sad, it got me into a rut where I didn't want to cook anything anymore, but then I basically went: ""Ok. More for me, suckers!""

Don't worry. I bet they'll appreciate your cooking more once they are forced to survive on dorm food. Then they'll ask you've if always cooked such delicious food, and you can roll your eyes at them."

It didn't stop until he got me so far that I screamed in pain, and proceeded to bawl. That last stomp hurt that bad. I think that's what it took for him to stop. That, and this went on for about a year, so it's likely that he matured enough to *care* about other people's feelings."

""Everyone has a tough time talking about certain feelings, even with and sometimes especially with the people they love. 

Sometimes it helps to talk about those feelings with someone who doesn't know you super well, because they can help you with getting a different perspective. And if not that, sometimes just talking about those feelings out loud with someone can make you feel better. 

The people whose job is to listen to those feelings are called 'therapists'. It's kind of like being a doctor who takes care of people's feelings."""

So we talked about logistic details. We talked about my fears and worries. But he found other people to talk to about his own feelings on it.

breakingmom,ff41wr8,t3_eredx2,1579553753.0,"I was there. I became eligible for yearly mammograms covered by insurance following having thyroid cancer in 2015. It's standard for insurance to approve yearly mammograms for women under 50 if they have a history of cancer. 

February 2018: I go to the doc for a cold. Doc reminds me helpfully to go get a mammogram because I'm overdue. 

""But I hate them!""

""I know. But you had thyroid cancer already, so that means you have to go every year now.""

""Ugh. Fine. Let's make the appointment.""

March 2018: Have the mammogram. Uh, oh. They call me two days later asking me to come in for a second mammogram and an ultrasound. That day. The day after, a radiologist calls me and tells me that they've referred me to a surgical specialist. I have Stage 0 ductal carciroma. 

April 2018: I see the surgeon. We go through the options: multiple biopsies, or a lumpectomy, or a lateral mastectomy. We talk the risks, etc. I go for lumpectomy. It has a higher margin to get everything they need to get. 

May 2018: One lumpectomy down, results of tissue biopsy come back as ""we don't have clear margins, so you need to have a larger lumpectomy.""

Me: ""I don't want to go through endless surgeries. Let's just do a mastectomy and get it over with.""

Surgeon: ""Your choice. FYI, I only do the lumpectomy twice anyway. Had you had a second lumpectomy and the margins were not clear, I would automatically recommend a mastectomy.""

Me: ""Yeah, but I wanna be done just the same""

(2020 me to 2018 me: ""Oh, you sweet summer child! Wait until you talk to the reconstruction surgeon!"")

FWIW, the surgeon reassured me that while my non-lumpy at all beforehand breast tissue was definitely cancerous, it was far from a death sentence. I found out a few months later than my psychiatrist survived stage 2 breast cancer. Twice.  As in one breast went when she was in her 40s, the other one followed several years later. Other than that, she's had perfect health since. And as she pointed out to me: ""This was back in the Stone age of breast cancer detection and treatment. Treatment success rates across the board for cancer has gotten 10 times better by now.""

My understanding is that more than one biopsy is often necessary *because* the current model of cancer treatment is to allow the patient to preserve as much healthy issue as possible. And as someone who has now gone through multiple such surgeries? You can do this. I promise!"

breakingmom,ff2cajr,t3_er2u7o,1579500473.0,"I assume you're getting therapy, because you mentioned calming techniques. Where is your therapist on meds? 

I say this because about 3 months into being diagnosed with depression, my therapist at the time had a ""come to Jesus"" talk with me. Like you,p just trying therapeutic techniques (e.g., ""Focus on 1 thing you see, 1 thing you hear, 1 thing you can feel with your body. Repeat, but with 2 of each. Repeat, but with three of each."") wasn't cutting it. My therapist basically had to say ""look, I can teach you all the tricks in the world to reduce anxiety, but if it's a matter of brain chemistry, none will work. Will you consider seeing a psychiatrist to talk about meds?"". I reluctantly agreed. Saw the psychiatrist. Went on meds. And now a lot of those techniques work, because my brain is not **literally** fighting against them."

We have about 6 Nerf guns. 

I've had to make a rule that you cannot shoot Nerf bullets at people. Ever. Because it's that black and white with 6 YO boys. 

The other thing he loves is Legos. He's been able to build various things on his own, without using the booklets that come with a set, since he was 4. That is one of those interests that ebbs and flows, but never quite stops. Probably because he's really gifted when it comes to spatial intelligence. I often joke that ""He could either build space rockets or become an evil villain when he grows up. It's 50/50, really"". 

My other kid isn't that outwardly expressive about things she likes. It's really like pulling teeth to get her to talk about the stuff she likes. For the most part you could (and I have, often) give her a box of crayons, lots of paper and a stapler, and she happily turns them into little booklets. That she often refuses to share about. Her other thing is reading. The bookworm genes are strong in that one (one grandma was a librarian, after all). Toys? They're nice, but it sometimes feels like she stopped asking for new toys at around 5. Thankfully, she's the sort of kid who might ask for experiences rather than things."
breakingmom,ff2a6h2,t3_eqxpsh,1579498406.0,"Yeah. He needs to get a dose of reality and focus on your housing issues. Dumbass.

That said, is it possible that he's just embarrassed by the situation and just pretending on the group chat that everything is fine? I've known a few people like that over the years, so I'm kinda wondering. 

Not saying to justify this behavior. Just... Tell him. To his face. ""WTH, here I am worrying about where we will sleep tomorrow, and you're still talking to [friends] about a vacation? FFS!"". Unless it's the sort of frank conversation that can never be had in your house. In which case, you've got much more to deal with than being homeless. :(

That sounds like my mom's stove top. It was old when she bought her house. 23 years ago. I only visit once a year, and I'm all ""Geesh, how old is this thing? Why has it not disintegrated yet?"". My mom has a second kitchen with a newer stove, so she feels no need to get a newer one for her main kitchen.
