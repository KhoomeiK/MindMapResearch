The only difference is that Huawei works arm in arm with an authoritarian government. But the USA security apparatus is pretty authoritarian too and the Patriot Act, etc....gives them a lot of freedom to operate. And they have put themselves out of the scope of a lot of checks and balances and they have judges rubber stamping anything they want.

It's not needed at all now but maybe it will be 1 or 2 times a week at first and ramp up as needed. There's no quality of life in these nursing homes, I have seen it first hand. Over the last 10-20 years of life it should cost the same and probably less than paying for a nursing home at least in Ontario which I don't think caps the accommodation charge for nursing homes like Alberta does (which I fear is part of the problem in this case as they cut services as much as possible).

A good nursing home in Ontario starts at like 3 k a month outside the GTA and maybe 4 K+ in the GTA. It's even more than that if you want something really dignified. 48-60 grand a year pays you a lot of nurse visits.

People should try to avoid this at all costs unless the health of the senior requires full time care. People seem to be using it because it's the easy way out to care for your parents. No one wants to be a full time caregiver but with some planning there are ways to delay and avoid this.

A lot of us can do 1-2 years at the end of life but it's the idea of having to care for someone for 15 years that makes people put their parents in a nursing home."

Once a week I can get away with with no ill effects, just the high is not as good. This is allegedly where i'm at right now.

Sometimes I allegedly say fuck it and go on a two or 3 day bender and regret it. It also robs me of at least one or two days (monday, tuesday) of productivity.....i just kind of get through the days.

You have to experiment to find the best conditions for you to thrive. When you finish a T break don't go on another 17 day steak. Maybe partake one day and take another week off and see how you feel. Remember that weed is habit forming.....more than it is addictive. So control your habits. If you program your brain to get high at 9 pm to watch Netflix it will demand it.

Understanding the level of demand will help you understand if there even bargains to be had and on which types of properties. Same thing with fair deals.

Average days on market will help you understand how quick to pull the trigger. If houses take 60 days to sell, it's very different than markets where bully offers are coming in before the open house and after the open house it goes to a chaotic multiple offer situation.
