nottheonion,fdr6ul1,t1_fdqzmi8,1578680233.0,"But as I understood it the VA does not require veterans to prove that their diabetes is service related to get coverage, despite studies showing that there is only limited/suggestive evidence of a connection. They‚Äôre not required to prove a connect to be eligible for coverage.  [diabetes-agent Orange](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/conditions/diabetes.asp) Not that I believe the VA provides perfect services. But the article seems to really misrepresent and sensationalize the story. And that approach isn‚Äôt helpful. Particularly when they throw in the Bernie Sanders pitch towards the end. Misleading and biased reporting."

BipolarReddit,fdmc54x,t1_fdm58wk,1578545247.0,"Yeah. Hypomanic sex. üòÅüòÅüòÅ Damn. I miss that.

But it‚Äôs not even that I can‚Äôt do without.  In normal times, now that we‚Äôre older and life is busy w teenagers at home and all that, it‚Äôs not the hypomanic amazing experiences I‚Äôd miss.  It‚Äôs just the chance to occasionally reconnect in that intense and personal way that only occurs between lovers. Ykwim?

I won‚Äôt lie and say I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy keeping up the really incredible and amazing hypodermic stuff. But I can manage life without that. I am not sure I can manage without something. I‚Äôve lost so damn much of whatever made me feel like an individual. I do t want to lose more. 

I hope I can find something that works out. I also hope that my doctor will be respectful. I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôll just blow off my concerns and attribute them to me wanting ‚Äúmanic sex‚Äù when I‚Äôm just talking about holding onto normal sex. Just like when I talk about creativity or enjoyment of life being dull on meds and they try to claim I‚Äôm simply missing ‚Äúmanic highs‚Äù. No!  Not unless I‚Äôve been manic my entire life. There were normal happy moments in there. I want to keep them. Not be a zombie. But I feel like there‚Äôs no happy medium. No compromise. 

Wish me luck tomorrow. Thanks for sharing your experience. I‚Äôm hoping I can have something like this."

bipolar,fdkvyn1,t1_fdkmvb1,1578512284.0,"BP1 as well. And haven‚Äôt yet found my ‚Äúmagic formula‚Äù hence considering lithium again (with much trepidation). Are you seeing an endocrinologist?  I would think someone such as yourself, with a very complicated medical history, would warrant specialist care. I usually just see my psychiatrist w an occasional visit to my family doctor for the other routine stuff like asthma and health screenings. 

I‚Äôve read stuff about the importance of measuring and following different types of thyroid hormone levels (vs just the TSH they typically screen with) and also about treating with greater doses of thyroid hormone to get the levels not just ‚Äúin range‚Äù but at the (high?) end of the range. Even some stuff about treating bipolar people w thyroid hormone even when they don‚Äôt techno meet the criteria for hypothyroidism. I don‚Äôt really understand all of the details but a good endocrinologist surely would. I intend to ask my psychiatrist about it tomorrow when I see him. 

I hope you get some helpful answers. If you‚Äôre not already going to an endocrinologist, perhaps you could request a referral for a consultation w one, if that‚Äôs an option. Could try seeing a dermatologist for hair loss too. They specialize in that. Lots of crossover between specialists when it comes to problems that involve multiple systems. Your endocrinologist would know what to look for also. Both specialists might have different insight and perspectives.  If it‚Äôs causing you a lot of distress, it could be worth pursuing. 

About ten years ago, prior to my diagnosis of bipolar, I started having hair loss during a really stressful time. I saw a dermatologist and she did a bunch of tests, not just thyroid, but hormones and I think some vitamin levels like B12. I don‚Äôt remember all of it but I know there were more.  They never found any cause other than stress back then. And it filled back in. But now, not so much.  I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I think we face very difficult choices when it comes to treating this. 

Hugs. Hope tomorrow‚Äôs visit gives you hope."
bipolar,fdkircx,t3_elv3v6,1578504631.0,"Kinda comes w the territory. If you can arrange some things do there are external limiting factors to slow you down or make extra steps for you to make it harder to just give in to the impulses, that can help. Put barriers in your way to make things harder. 

For example, if impulse spending is a big problem, don‚Äôt carry credit cards around w you or ride have a prepaid card w a limited amount on it or use cash. Don‚Äôt set up your online accounts to save a payment method to automatically pay for purchases. Require yourself to get out the card and enter the info. Consider even having a second bank account where you deposit some of your paycheck but don‚Äôt have a debit card for it. Make it savings and emergency only. Consider even putting some emergency funds in the care of a person you fully trust

If regrettable sexual decisions are a problem, don‚Äôt have apps on your phone that allow you to hook up easily. You can even get a parental control app through some service providers which will let you block yourself from using apps or sites you know will get you in trouble. Remove and block contacts on your phone for people who you know are going to put you at risk (same goes for drug contacts if that‚Äôs a problem). And when you go out, ask a trusted friend to act as the opposite of your ‚Äúwing man‚Äù. Have them intentionally steer you away from potential bad decisions and remind you that you asked them to look out for you fir your well-being. 

Those are some ideas. I especially struggle w spending, so I need to establish external limits like that when I‚Äôm struggling w mood. I know that a lot of these measures are only as good as your ability to follow them. You can get past them. But having some added steps and extra opportunities to pause and think about an impulsive choice may help protect you."
bipolar,fdkh3ll,t3_elv9wm,1578503744.0,"Yes. When I took lithium, my hair began to thin as well. It‚Äôs not that bad looking since I had thick hair to begin with but it upsets me all the same bc it‚Äôs not nice like it was before. I ended up switching off lithium after several months (multiple reasons). Now considering trying it again but I‚Äôm terrified of losing more hair. I feel for you. There are other options, but if lithium is working well, I know it‚Äôs scary to try changing. I would hope your doctor has checked a thyroid level. Lithium is known to a age the thyroid and low thyroid can cause hair loss. Good luck."

bipolar,fda653c,t1_fd8vxj7,1578242229.0,"Hope it works for you. I thought the pricing was ridiculously high. But you‚Äôre right, it IS your eyes, after all. I preferred the little single use packets for ease of use, but I don‚Äôt think I ever really needed the full dropper for single use. Thus, the multi-use bottles go much further for the money. And then you‚Äôre not paying a premium for extra packaging which also creates more waste. I hope you notice done improvement."
bipolar,fd6u7fd,t1_fd3kjf8,1578195768.0,I was surprised just how much the dryness could affect my vision. Sometimes a lot!  And I didn‚Äôt always feel it as much as I noticed in my vision. Definitely worth trying to treat. Drops may need to be used very often though.
bipolar,fd6tv2p,t1_fd3rnw7,1578195640.0,Good reminder. Dry mouth is terrible for promoting tooth decay. A water bottle at hand is a good idea too.
bipolar,fd6hmqi,t1_fd5mq78,1578191154.0,"You could always try drops. I especially notice my vision is worse at night. The street lights and auto headlights radiate starlike rays of light all around. I use moisturizing drops throughout the day as often as I remember. And prescription cyclosporine drops twice daily. I still get weird blurry vision sometimes, but not so much."
CavaPoo,fd3e2lj,t3_ejy50r,1578157416.0,"Cutie!  I put a bunch of rubber-backed rugs down around the halls. Helps keep puppy feet from slipping and also I hate the gritty feeling of any sand or debris under my feet so the rugs can be taken out and shaken and/or vacuumed regularly and washed easily when pup tracks in any dirt from outside (mine lives to dig!). Also, I‚Äôve noticed when potty training pups, they‚Äôll tend to pick a rug vs bare floor. Not that I want to encourage goi g on any rug, but if you have any large area rugs or carpeted spaces, it‚Äôs far preferable to have a small toss rug you can spray w enzyme spray and thoroughly machine machine wash than having to try to properly clean an area of carpet. Fortunately our Cavapoo learned quickly. Have fun."
bipolar,fd3b4xs,t3_ejuru2,1578156497.0,Feeling manic at all?
bipolar,fd3ajlj,t3_ejybk5,1578156393.0,"I had issues w blurry vision which occurred while I was on Latuda and Lamictal. I ended up seeing an optometrist and a couple of eye doctors and was weaned off both meds but it didn‚Äôt get better. My vision was sometimes blurrier than other times. I got new glasses which sometimes seemed to help but other times seemed to make my head hurt. They tried to tell me my vision had just gotten worse on its own, not due to meds, but that made no sense in my case bc sometimes it was actually back to baseline the way it used to be. 

Finally I got referred to some big shot ultra specialist at a tertiary care medical center. The conclusion?  Dry eyes!  Lol!  The reason it became apparent when I started on meds was bc some meds dry you out (eyes, mouth, etc). The reasons it varied were many:  dose, timing, environment, allergies, etc. Now I just use a lot of eye drops and treat my allergies better. I still notice it‚Äôs blurrier at some times than others, but I went back to my old prescription and no longer have headaches and drops are pretty simple and painless. 

Not that dryness is necessarily the reason for your vision problems, but I shared this bc it is possible that something besides just medication could be contributing to the vision problem. Even if it occurred at the same time as the dose increase (like mine did) it could be something that could be improved by other measures (like drops, etc), allowing you to continue the medication that‚Äôs helping you. And it‚Äôs possible that you did experience a change in your baseline prescription that was accentuated by the medications and if you changed prescriptions you‚Äôd get along fine. 

In my case, the problem was pretty easy to fix, despite all the messing around between providers and Dow is lists and med changes. It probably my was mostly unnecessary. All the doctors I saw reassured me that there was nothing permanently damaging about staying on my meds, so that was reassuring. I‚Äôm not an ophthalmologist though, so I suggest you go consult one. An MD, not just a vision specialist. And find out if it‚Äôs definitely due to meds, meds causing some other thing to be more of an issue (dry eyes, elevated blood sugar, etc) or perhaps something unrelated. 

Good luck."
doggrooming,fd2mkvx,t1_fd28mnt,1578149364.0,"Thank you. I‚Äôll look over the brushes I‚Äôve got. I tried the smallest slicker I own in her armpits. It‚Äôs softer but I think it scraped her skin?  We must have looked ridiculous by the end bc she was so stressed out she stood w her from paws on my shoulder (like a big hug). At least it gave me access to her armpits. Couldn‚Äôt see a thing, but I could feel the knots to comb them out.  The mats are so tiny you have to feel to find them,

I stand her up on a bath mat on a small table and hook her leash over a cabinet knob. The table came w am ‚Äúarm‚Äù but it‚Äôs too short and wobbly and seems worthless since she keeps turning in circles to evade the brush and she tangles the loops from the arm on it. Seems like there should be two arms. Then when I get to a difficult part she wants to climb up on me. I can deal w it but I doubt a groomer would want to."

doggrooming,fczlnr5,t1_fczl5sl,1578103933.0,Thanks!  I ordered a bottle.
doggrooming,fczky46,t1_fczivic,1578103499.0,One more quick question. Do you spray the Quicker  Slicker on the dog dry?  Or do you use only after bathing or spritzing down the dog?  I saw both Quicker Slicker and The Stuff on Amazon. I imagine a bottle goes a long way for one pet.
doggrooming,fczkldt,t1_fczivic,1578103274.0,"Thank you for these recommendations. I‚Äôll check them out. Interesting about the Cavapoo coat. I‚Äôve looked at some of the pics of super matted dogs and been horrified. I don‚Äôt want anything like that so I‚Äôm trying to do a decent job preventing it. But it‚Äôs mostly not that bad. Nothing like descriptions of the matting some get. Hence my asking if maybe it was variable coat types-them not being consistent in mixed breeds. I haven‚Äôt seen many versions of doodles in person besides labradoodles bc we live in the middle of rural nowhere where it‚Äôs mostly hunting and herding dogs and farm mutts. Lol. 

This is the first time in 35 years there hasn‚Äôt been a beagle, a lab or some mix of one of these residing under our roof. I drew the line at no more labs after our last one passed. The hair and dander of an aging lab drive me insane. Hubby suggested labradoodle but we got this smaller doodle because we‚Äôre older and plan to travel often in a camper. Apparently it was a good choice. She‚Äôs been great for us. Approximately beagle sized but smarter and friendlier."
doggrooming,fczir7h,t1_fczfetv,1578102144.0,Thankfully we get her groomed this week so we can tame the length. She never had armpit tangles like this with a shorter style!  I like the face a bit fluffy but it will be nice to see her eyes again!
doggrooming,fcziffr,t1_fczhem0,1578101943.0,"Thank you!  I‚Äôm really trying to do a good job w her bc i had been advised these mixed coats can be high maintenance. I hope hers doesn‚Äôt get more difficult. I have a pretty big sized comb so it doesn‚Äôt seem too bad. 

It‚Äôs definitely possible she has bad associations w the brush since that‚Äôs what we started with. I‚Äôve been working hard to try to train her to cooperate w grooming. As she‚Äôs gotten older it‚Äôs a lot easier!  But some days she‚Äôs still not crazy about it. 

Do you have a recommendation for a detangling product?  Or are they mostly comparable?"
doggrooming,fczh5ty,t1_fczfetv,1578101155.0,"Apologies I didn‚Äôt get my comments posted fast enough to get ahead of replies. If you have a moment, I had concerns bc the slickers I‚Äôve tried seem uncomfortable and she‚Äôs easier to just comb out using the metal comb."
doggrooming,fczgyay,t1_fczeh9x,1578101022.0,"Sorry, my comments took a bit to fill in so could you please look at what I wrote?  I‚Äôm having trouble w the slicker and find just combing easier, partly bc she seems uncomfortable w the slicker."
doggrooming,fczgns7,t3_ejos6d,1578100835.0,"Looking at the pics of this poodle/cavalier spaniel mix, what grooming tools would seem best suited?  

Going by the recommendations for poodle mixes, I‚Äôve tried using a slicker, followed by a metal comb; but I‚Äôm finding it easier to skip the brush and simply comb her. I tried three brands of slickers but they all seem sharp and I feel like they set in tangles rather than breaking them up, even when using the line brushing technique I‚Äôve viewed in recommended videos. If I just comb. Beginning lightly at the ends and moving toward the skin, I can more easily work through the entire coat and the dog seems happier.  I start w the wide side of the comb then finish w the finer teeth. 

I‚Äôll use the slicker on her moustache and beard and a little bit on her feet mostly. She doesn‚Äôt seem to like it much, but she clearly enjoys having the comb used on her head and ears and tolerates combing the rest of her body. 

Since mixed breeds come with a variety of coat types, maybe the typical ‚Äúdoodle‚Äù grooming tools aren‚Äôt ideal for her? 

Her coat is very cottony soft and mostly wavy, rather than curly, except around the head and neck which have a bit more curl. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be much of a distinct undercoat. She sheds only very minimally with routine brushing/combing. I just had her to the vet and he did not think her coat would continue to change much more. Sorry she‚Äôs looking a bit scruffy, but due to surgery, we had to delay grooming, so she‚Äôs more than a month overdue for a haircut.  I had just finished brushing and combing her out when I snapped these pics. Close-up is over her side/chest area.

Thoughts?   I had to work at a couple tiny mats under her armpits, but the rest was pretty easy. She hated the slicker when I tried it on those knots. I wound up just picking them gently apart w the end of the comb and resorted to a de-matting tool for the worst ones (which I didn‚Äôt want to use bc I had been told to avoid them).  Usually she has very minimal matting but I like to keep her cut shorter and it‚Äôs been super snowy so she‚Äôs been wet a lot and I think that makes her tangle more."

CavaPoo,fcunymz,t3_eircoe,1577985031.0,"The thing I wish I had done much more of in advance of getting our puppy was to learn more about raising and training a puppy. We are by no means new to dog ownership (husband and I have had lots of previous dogs) but the approach to dog training has evolved since my old 4-H days and there‚Äôs so much to know about the general approach and progression of teaching your dog. And if you have a good handle on the concepts of training and purpose of specific activities, as well as a vision of how the progression of dog socialization and learning go, you‚Äôll be so much better prepared. 

I figured we knew what we were doing and I just watched some videoed to refresh me about potty training and crate training and puppy care. Then I signed up for in person classes. I could have been a lot better prepared and learned more in advance of being home puppy. My prep and classes weren‚Äôt enough. 

Cavapoos are very smart and very energetic. The approach we had taken with previous pups (labs & mixes, hounds & mixes) were insufficient fir this far more active, clever, people-centric, attention-seeking pooch who would play with you and with toys all day if she could. She learned faster than I could teach her and I totally feel like I‚Äôm missing out on all kinds of opportunities to be training her throughout the day. My fear then is that the missed teaching opportunities will reinforce bad habits.  Our Cavapoo is by far the smartest dog we‚Äôve ever had. Able to learn more quickly and pick up on things spontaneously as well as what we directly teach. This includes her learning how to manipulate us if we‚Äôre not wary and her finding ways to make trouble or noise if she‚Äôs bored. 

So read up a bunch. Watch a lot of training videos. Go well beyond the puppy basics so you don‚Äôt get left in the dust like me. And if you don‚Äôt honestly think you have the time and energy to devote to a busy, people-loving, high energy dog that needs lots of exercise and mental stimulation, consider a milder mannered dog. I am over the moon thrilled w the personality and train ability of our Cavapoo, she‚Äôs a more demanding and challenging dog than say, my beagle/lab mix, which was far more content to just hang out in the back yard, dig holes and sniff things or lay at your feet indoors. The Cavapoo wants regular interaction throughout the day. And you need to brush well at least 2-3 times a week for some dogs w easy coats or even every day for dogs w coats that tend to mat, particularly if you don‚Äôt want to maintain their coat at a shorter clipped length."

Read the warnings that are right on the packaging of those leashes. It is stated as a risk by the manufacturer, no doubt because it is a known risk and they want to avoid future lawsuits."
DogCultureFree,fcogx3e,t1_fb3ofhm,1577831956.0,"Agreed. I think a lot of folks would enjoy the company of dogs or other animals. I‚Äôm s little uncomfortable w cafes featuring animals that aren‚Äôt really evolved to be human companions. 

I think that kind of dog cafe differs from what‚Äôs described in the article, where owners take their own pet dogs to hang out or dine w them. I‚Äôll call that a dog-friendly cafe, to distinguish. 

I actually like the concept of a dog-friendly cafe or other establishment, when appropriate, because it‚Äôs important to take dogs out into a variety of environments and around people and other animals as part of the process of training them to behave properly, with good calm manners. This is particularly if you would like to be able to take your dog for walks around the neighborhood, to parks, visit grandma at the retirement home, etc. But my notion of ‚Äúdog cafe‚Äù has nothing to do with ridiculous menu options or frou-frou dog treatments."

bipolar,fc3yac9,t3_efqi0z,1577401749.0,"Yes. Way too fucking exhausting. I‚Äôm so tired right now. I know there will be a day in the near future when it starts to improve.  But for now, it feels like too much."
bipolar,fc3xsa2,t3_efqipw,1577401372.0,Still haven‚Äôt lost it
bipolar,fc3xc96,t1_fc3raty,1577401045.0,I had both the sexual dysfunction and the weight gain. Lucky me.
bipolar,fc3x7to,t1_fc3c8pq,1577400954.0,"Yup. This. I‚Äôm absolutely fucking miserable and angry that I‚Äôm gonna have to start yet another shitty drug that‚Äôs going to most likely cause sexual dysfunction, weight gain, somnolence and brain fog. Y‚Äôall please pardon my lack of enthusiasm. I‚Äôm sure it must just be my depression. How depressed does a person need to be to want to take pills that do this???"
bipolar,fc3wvuw,t3_efufcc,1577400710.0,"I wish it was merely a stereotype for me. Alas, every goddamn drug I‚Äôve ever been prescribed has destroyed my sex life. Consider yourself fortunate."
bipolar,fc3wqh3,t3_efv6nq,1577400599.0,Hang in there. We survived most of the holiday season. Just a few more days til new year. I‚Äôm having a shitty time and mood feels crazy awful unstable.  But it could be better next week. It‚Äôs gonna be better sometime.
bipolar,fc3wef5,t3_efwpgd,1577400350.0,I feel the same way.
bipolar,fc3vtd1,t3_eg22jf,1577399918.0,I‚Äôm sorry. Sounds like you‚Äôre going through some bad times. But please don‚Äôt hurt yourself.
CavaPoo,fc3rwbk,t3_efjfl6,1577397073.0,Ours is 25 lbs at 8 months.
bipolar,fbzslii,t3_efdg14,1577259350.0,Sorry. Not sure if it makes you feel bette mr it worse. But you‚Äôre not alone. Not alone at all. Well get through this. Hang in there.
bipolar,fbzsjdf,t3_efdnhq,1577259263.0,I was just thinking this same thing.  Be well folks. Holiday season can be a difficult time. You can do this!
HumansBeingBros,fbzrm7v,t3_efd1pq,1577257961.0,Way to go #50! My hero. Shoutout to the boys coach and mum and dad as well. Some grownups are doing some good work raising good humans.
bipolar,fbzqe97,t3_efcsw1,1577256331.0,"Are you being treated adequately fir your illness?  With medications that make you stable and also therapy to help you work through these issues?

I don‚Äôt have the sense that you‚Äôre truly a bad personality. I think of bar people as sociopath types who are intentional and don‚Äôt care what impact anything has on others. 

The rest of us, we struggle. But we can improve with effort and treatment. And if we care about improving. That matters."
bipolar,fbzq977,t3_efctco,1577256154.0,This is wonderful to read!  Very encouraging for someone who isn‚Äôt feeling so optimistic at the moment. Best wishes in your new year!
bipolar,fbzq73g,t3_efd14k,1577256081.0,"Personally, I think nonalcoholic beer is a bad idea. It just seems like something people who aren‚Äôt really ready to give up beer will attach themselves to. But that could be me being totally a clueless idiot. I‚Äôm only basing on personal experience w a few people. So ignore if it‚Äôs irrelevant. 

As for decaf coffee, that seems just too damn extreme. You can‚Äôt compare alcohol and caffeine as if they were the same. They are not. Period. There‚Äôs possibly some link w make some mania worse. But there‚Äôs hardly the degree of evidence against it as for alcohol. I have moderate caffeine. Moderate caffeine has not been shown to cause health problems. That‚Äôs 1-2 caffeinated drinks a day. The amount in decaf coffee is negligible. Someone sounds like they‚Äôre being a control freak to me."
CavaPoo,fbzptqr,t3_ef7hl6,1577255612.0,Awww!  Cutie!
BipolarReddit,fbzpskq,t3_efd23d,1577255571.0,"Yep. I think I experience increased energy and agitation nearly every night. Sometimes, it gets pretty severe and includes feelings of generalized anxiety and severe irritability. It‚Äôs not fun. I take benzos to help me sleep in this case.  I‚Äôm not personally a benzo fan. I mostly try to avoid taking them during the day. I dislike the idea of rebound anxiety. But to get to sleep when I‚Äôm feeling all amped up and restless at night, they do help.  Sometimes with sonata too. Pdoc prefers i just stick to the benzos vs benzo plus sonata, so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing. My moods always seem to escalate at night tho"
CavaPoo,fbxxbwu,t3_eezcnb,1577202925.0,It was exhausting!
BipolarReddit,fbv8nx5,t3_ed56mz,1577127240.0,"Yeah. üòî. Sorry. Last night was just me at my shittiest and having a damn hard struggle. I way overreacted when you were clearly reaching out, generously and compassionately, to try to help. 

Please forgive my really reactive, rude and undeserved reply. It‚Äôs difficult feeling optimistic for me. It‚Äôs easier to encourage others. I feel like I got on treatment too little too late. But I don‚Äôt know that that‚Äôs true. So I‚Äôve gotta just keep plugging away. 

And when someone offers some encouragement, the proper response is, ‚Äúthank you for your concern and sharing your experiences and suggestions‚Äù. Please forgive my crappy response."
