But yeah, it would be astounding to see Trump pull a win out of his ass. Especially with all the proof and things against him. A lot of people are going to be mad if he gets out of it scot-free."

facepalm,ff08d9w,t3_eqycyu,1579466240.0,This is what I get for not watching/reading the news. I didn't even realize that Space Force was still a thing what with the Democratic nominations and Trump's impeachment taking center stage.

This does not apply to real life. It's just that Richard is being kind of a dickhead."
