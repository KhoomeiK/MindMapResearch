My base pay, for instance is 8 dollars per 25 min lesson. For the 45 min, it is 7.50. For every student who rates me 10--I get (.5)(7.5)=3.75 added to that. So, if I have one student, the most I can hope for is a 11.25/hour. 2, the most I can hope for is 15. This is if and only if they rate me, and rate me the full 10.
