You probably wanted to protect your daughter from grief and chose to do it in this way. I’m not in a position tell you that what you did was wrong, however when she gets older you’ll have some explaining you’ll have to do. 

I feel there are better ways to explain death to a young child, such as telling her that your dog has moved on to after life but it’s ok, because your dog will watch over her. Your daughter will be a bit sad but she’s young, she’ll learn to accept the grief and move on, especially with a new puppy. 

Your daughter might have a different view of death now and it might affect how she’ll view death in the future, which could cause complications. In my opinion, it would be best to clear that now. A child can be very adaptive and if you tell her she’ll learn how to move on after grief."
AmItheAsshole,fflne77,t3_eu5x9o,1580041805.0,"Why would you condemn your son’s behaviour??  Did he cheat at the game?? He’s a child, obviously he would enjoy winning and your wife is probably mature enough to deal with her defeat. If he cheated or didn’t show good sportsmanship then maybe gently remind him.

Also, do you have a problem with how close he is with your wife? Cause it sounds like you aren’t happy with how he’s constantly sticking to her. It sounds like he just wants to be close to his mother before his sibling comes out. It shouldn’t be something to condemn.

I’m not quite sure what you’re upset about because this sounds like it’s solely between your son and your wife. If you’re trying to insert yourself and “condemning your son” for wanting attention then you’re TA. 

Maybe try thinking from his perspective. He’s young and just learned that he will have a sibling soon. It’ll  mean that for the first year you guys will be very busy with the new baby. He wants his mother’s attention before she has the baby, and that’s how he shows that he wants attention."

You did amazing standing up for your daughter. 
It feels the worst when people make snide little comments about someone’s body (especially a youth because it can really affect their mindset) and everybody acts like it’s normal. 

It’s NOT ok and more people should have stood up for your daughter. Jokes about someone else’s body are not ok and people who make those comments should be called out, even if it makes everything awkward. It was the right thing to let your daughter know that her body is fine the way it is and he shouldn’t have said that."
AskReddit,fcv572h,t3_ej0l8g,1577994884.0,I was born in the US and my environment influenced me a lot. I didn’t know/realize fully at that time but I guess my thinking was a bit racist and homophobic. Moving to a more progressive part of Canada changed my mindset.

It’s going to be a lucky year! :)"
