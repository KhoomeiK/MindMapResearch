trump,ffc5xsa,t3_est9og,1579792293.0,"Not too many people would be foolish enough to start any sort of confrontation with people toting guns around. Even if they did, I still believe the citizens there would have shown restraint and not resorted to gun violence. Interestingly enough I didn't hear that they blocked traffic or anything foolish like that."

AskReddit,fczhram,t3_ejniim,1578101532.0,If we did this we would end up holding elections in the form of MMA fights and using the results as our basis for voting. Hardly what I find to be ideal for selecting leadership.
