INFO: is this “frivolous” expenditure the first they’ve contended? If so, NTA. You deserve a $5 book if it makes you happy. If it’s not the first time, perhaps try saving up to take your boyfriend out. Your mom is in the wrong but it sounds like he could use a little TLC. Actually maybe do that either way."

AMA,fffntc1,t1_fffg4ld,1579887949.0,"I got her at a breeder in PA! 

Funny enough, I didn’t choose a Shih Tzu, I was originally looking for a cockapoo or cavapoo. But the breeder I went to see didn’t have any left, but they had her.  When I met her, it was all over. She was, and is, the cutest thing I’ve ever seen. 

She’s my only pup, the other three in my family live with my parents.

Ideally I would like to get her a friend in a couple years, she LOVES other dogs. I’d love to adopt one but I’m allergic to most kinds so I have to be picky.

Thanks for asking! Do you have any dogs?"
ntbdbiwdfta,fffg28s,t3_etabov,1579883181.0,I’m borderline enraged at how cute your dog is.

hotsauce,ffc8l25,t3_esuhyw,1579794014.0,It’s like looking at a juice bottle and seeing the ingredients say “fruit.” So annoying.
hotsauce,ffaful4,t1_ffaep0u,1579734765.0,"Oh wow. You just nailed what I don’t like about these, which I’ve been failing to do for so long. I don’t like a sauce that punches you in the mouth. I like the flavor first with creeping heat. And you helped me figure that out!

Thank you for your eloquence, I’m glad you enjoyed your Torchbearers more than I did!"

AmItheAsshole,ff9nfzu,t3_esc9jx,1579716662.0,"NTA - I used to ride the train a lot and sometimes would accidentally hop on a quiet car. People usually pointed it out pretty quickly if I was on the phone or something and guess what? I moved. The quiet car is there for a reason, everyone should respect it."

Fast forward 25 years, I’m 27 and my dad has always had this habit of talking with a lisp when he’s joking around. I finally ask why. It’s because he started talking like that as a joke when I did (all in good fun), and only one of us grew out of it."
