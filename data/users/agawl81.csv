news,ff91ttl,t1_ff8s1ud,1579702739.0,"I have a parent in a snit at me right now because I told their child that we were working on grammar and they needed to quit swinging their bible around announcing that they have a bible at the top of their lungs. 

Like, yes, your kid can read a bible in school. No, your kid can't refuse to do what I've assigned and disrupt his table partners with it."

kansas,ff6muw8,t1_ff3s7uq,1579630576.0,It’s the guns not the financial aspect that draws them to the red side. If Democrats backed down on gun control and did more to embrace and build up rural America they’d gain some significant ground here.
kansas,ff6mp4b,t1_ff2mmnb,1579630478.0,Laura kelly wants to push repaying KPRS out another ten years to buy some breathing room. I’m not a fan of that idea nor of continuing to rob highways. That’s my retirement that I pay into. The state should pay its share. And bad roads are a safety issue.
kansas,ff6mhi2,t3_er7zzt,1579630350.0,I’m a teacher and I work with special needs kids. Before the big cut a normal caseload for my or my co workers was 15 students. Now 25 to 30 isn’t unusual. I teach multiple classes at a time. (Think one grade of English and another of math in the same room at the same time with the same teacher) when I ask for more help I’m told there’s no money. We have more students and fewer aids in addition to higher case loads.
kansas,ff6m25l,t1_ff6c4r2,1579630089.0,Welp. That adds another item to the move in application. “Name your top three methods of keeping us informed about the unit” disqualify anyone who mentions pee.

SkincareAddiction,ff5rydj,t3_erpv5c,1579607943.0,"The issue: Dry crinkly skin even with using what seems like good skin care

Skin type: Dry, I'm 38 so maybe that plays a role. 

current routine: At night I use the ordinary's gravaniod retinol 2.5%, the buffet and the natural moisturizing factors after I wash my face. I have some drunk elephant jelly cleanser that I got as a sample that I've been using. If I wore makeup I remove it with a bi layer makeup remover. 

Length of use: Three months. I fell off the skincare wagon last summer and have tried to pick it back up. I recently switched from the ordinary's retinol 1% to the granawhatever because my skin was getting flaky. 

I'm in the mid west, we've had weird weather where it will be mild, then really really cold for a couple of days and back to mild. 

My face will feel dry less than half an hour after I put the facial lotion on, when it is really bad I have started adding petroleum jelly or shea butter over top of all of the other stuff, but it is still dry feeling in the morning."

fatlogic,ff4deja,t1_ff2v2jv,1579560972.0,"Low carb is over hyped, but it isn't complete bullshit. I have reactive hypoglycemia, probably because I spent years eating like shit and am genetically vulnerable to T2DM. If I eat a meal with a large amount of refined carbs, my blood sugar crashes into the 60 - 40 range a few hours later. This was completely symptomless, I thought I had fatigue or something. Then I had a blood panel done for an unrelated reason, my blood sugar was 42 and I drove home like that. So year, I'm going to limit sugars and refined carbs, self experiementation has taught me that potatoes area problem but small portions of corn tortillas aren't. I eat a lot of eggs and veggies."
fatlogic,ff4d1yo,t1_ff3jyux,1579560742.0,"In my observation, clearance racks have the extremes with no middle, so xxs, xs, and s and then xxl, xxxl and so on. Medium, large, and extra large sometimes are usually gone or only there in an awful color. I think that is because most of the population would fall into those sizes, not because of a clothing manufacturing conspiracy."
fatlogic,ff4cv8c,t1_ff4bq8p,1579560620.0,"Yeah, but there aren't enough people doing that to diminish the amount of available large sized clothes. And its silly to go buy a brand new garmet for that sort of project. For recyling something that you were given that doesn't fit, sure, but brand new stuff from a big box is at least 30 or more, and then there's the materials, time and equipment used on the garmet alteration. The person is better off just buying a mini skirt at that point."
Teachers,ff4c21o,t1_ff49jgm,1579560088.0,I’m looking for an out. I like most of the kids but I’m not feeling supported by admin and I feel like the parent culture is not reasonable. I’ve had more parents pissed at me this year than the nine I’ve taught before it.
Teachers,ff471cv,t1_ff46812,1579556941.0,It was so minor compared to what I deal with I honestly forgot except for it was a bible he was gaga about. This is a kid who doesn’t read.
Teachers,ff467ce,t1_ff45o1h,1579556424.0,Right. Like she’s even familiar with my class. Middle school. Sped. I keep them busy. So that should have ended it there.
