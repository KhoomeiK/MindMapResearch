dyeing,fclr9u8,t3_ehtyw4,1577754546.0,"I think Procion has information on their website about the sustainability and environmental impact of their dyes!

Personally I would say fiber reactive dyes are more sustainable because it’s such a small amount and lasts longer, whereas natural dyes need a mordant and would definitely need to be dyed multiple times over the item’s life to retain the color, which is potentially using more resources. 

Been thinking about ways to make synthetic dyes more sustainable lately, not sure how many times you can reuse a dye bath but I think using as little dye as you can and using it up completely is the answer. But that’s just speculation, need to do some experiments :)"
femalefashionadvice,fbxmncn,t3_ef0ern,1577194076.0,"I think it’s because for women, fashion is seen as more of a form of communication than it is a thing you wear. Like for men, there’s a default outfit. T-shirt and jeans don’t necessarily have to mean anything. People aren’t going to make judgments about your personality if they see you in khakis, because just about every guy wears khakis. 

Meanwhile for women, there’s no default outfit, it’s like garments come with an attached personality and style. Khakis are definitely preppy, office-y, maybe even uptight? You wouldn’t see every women wearing khakis. Spaghetti straps can be sexy, but also delicate, but almost never masculine. It’s like you have to pick what kind of person you are or want to be every time you get dressed. It’s exhausting! Maybe that’s why so many of us only wear black, lol."
