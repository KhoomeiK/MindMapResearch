dogs,ffiufwk,t1_ffisqng,1579983002.0,"Where on earth did you get the impression I’m tricking people into adopting dogs?  We tell potential adopters everything we know about our dogs, which includes a two page exam report by one of our veterinarians, a CBC and blood chemistry, blood borne and intestinal parasite screens, and a complete medical history documenting everything we’ve done to the dog.

We also give our complete observations of the dog’s behavior and why we think it would or wouldn’t fit into the adopter’s home and family.

As for stigmatized breeds, I have no interest in “tricking” anyone.  Pit bull is a nebulous term that means different things to different people, and if a potential adopter disagrees with my classification I’m not going to try to convince them otherwise.  At the end of the day, a nonprofit business is still a business and client satisfaction is an important part of growth and sustainability.  An adoption where the adopter doesn’t have all the information I have is a bad adoption."
dogs,ffhmt0u,t1_ffhmd3v,1579942848.0,"I don’t know.  I figure the preset breed profiles are designed to work with the auto publishing feature because any new classifications I create have publishing errors.  

Basically, 60% (or more, if you don’t count cat adoptions through my retail partners) of my adoptions are to adopters that live within 5 miles of my shelter.  That’s the way I prefer it, as adopters who just walk in off the street are more likely to become clients at our partner hospital and utilize post adoption services like training.  I love maintaining post adoption relationships and seeing our rescues blossom.  So to the extent that adoption sites target more distant adopters, that’s not really my agenda.

On the other hand, I charge higher adoption fees for “in demand” dogs.  That’s a decision I struggled with initially, because as far as I’m concerned all my dogs are equally valuable and my favorite dogs are amputees, tan chis and pocket bullies that no one wants.  But I’ve got bills to pay... labor costs and a staff vet aren’t cheap.  So adoption sites help move highly adoptables, which is probably a necessary evil."
dogs,ffhm4s4,t1_ffhlvdh,1579941839.0,"We adopt out about 1200 animals a year, so I can’t really manually enter the profiles to each adoption site... I just let the shelter management software do that.  So if theres an a generic mixed breed option in my shelter management that also ports into the adoption sites, I haven’t found it yet.

As for pits vs “highly adoptables...” Have you seen High Fidelity?  [There’s a scene](https://youtu.be/-ECyX8A3iP0)  that reminds me of dealing with certain types of adopters.

My shelter is the Championship Vinyl of animal welfare"
dogs,ffhexe4,t1_ffhean7,1579932409.0,"I created a breed classification that’s just “mixed breed dog,” and it’s handled fine by the database... the problem is that the shelter management software has to communicate with several other software systems (the practice management software our partner hospital uses, petfinder/adopt-a-pet/ other adoption sites, our microchip manufacturer) none of whic recognize “mixed breed dog” as a classification.

I currently have two corgi mixes on shelter, which got posted to several corgi transport/rescue groups and I got harassed by a corgi rescue that I guess feels like they should have been the ones to pull them.  If I have anything remotely desirable, that’s the kind of crap I have to put up with, or people messaging from 500 miles away and getting butthurt because I don’t adopt outside of my metro area.

I’m constantly threatening to change the breed classification of shih tzus, poodles/doodles, and Maltese to “pit bull” so I don’t have to deal with the drama."
dogs,ffhdw9e,t3_etf2nf,1579931292.0,"I run a rescue shelter.  I don’t use cutesy language, but then again the only petfinder profiles that get much attention are the ones that are highly sought after breeds.

I train my staff to talk to adopters about their homes, families, and lifestyle and match dogs up appropriately.  There’s no benefit to my organization in being deceptive or coy about aspects of the dog’s personality."
dogs,ffhdffv,t1_ffham9x,1579930793.0,"I run a rescue shelter and if my shelter software allowed it I would classify all dogs by size and hair coat rather than breed.  “Large, long terrier coat dog,” “small, short haired dog.”  Breed classification gives me nothing but headaches... either I get people blowing me up about (and getting mad because they weren’t able to adopt) highly sought after dogs, or dogs that get no attention because they’re either not easily classified or they’re a stigmatized breed."
dogs,ffa4n5b,t3_esf45f,1579727797.0,"I run an animal shelter and anorexia on intake is a common problem.  One thing that works 99% of the time is feeding them on a flat surface.  Our shelter vet says that dogs and cats don’t really like sticking their faces in bowls and it can cause them to go off their food if they’re nervous or nauseous.  So a dog or cat that’s not eating gets fed on a flat paper towel instead of a paper bowl, and they almost always eat.

As a result, I stopped feeding my personal dogs in bowls and always feed them on flat surfaces."
dogs,ffa3b1i,t1_ffa1rb9,1579727038.0,"Yes.  I had a chihuahua who escaped from my yard frequently to eat cat food.  I was worried he was going to get hurt, so I used a wireless fence.  It was very effective."
dogs,ffa1ky5,t3_eshcwj,1579726042.0,"There are devices called wireless fences that can keep the dog within a specified distance of your house.  It consists of an electric collar and a base station that sends out a signal that will administer a warning sound, vibration and/or mild shock if the dog strays too far from your home.  They cost about $300 and you can get them on amazon if it’s not available locally."
dogs,ff9zhfr,t3_esgot3,1579724814.0,Usually parvo treatment involves iv fluids.  If the IV catheter was in the puppy’s neck there can be a hematoma there from the catheter.
dogs,ff9ywfu,t3_esh126,1579724474.0,"I run a shelter, and this has come up for me before on adopted animals.  Usually the manufacturer of the heart worm preventative will pay for treatment if she’s been on preventatives continuously.

Other thing to be aware of is that there is a window of time in which she could have been infected prior to your adoption and not tested positive.  Basically preventative only kills larval heart worms up to a certain stage of larval development, and a dog can’t test positive on a snap test until 8+ months after infection because that’s how long it takes larval heart worms to turn into adult heart worms."
dogs,ff37h1h,t3_er20td,1579535510.0,Some dogs walk on their toes and keep their nails short.  Some dogs walk on their pads and their nails need to be trimmed more often.
unpopularopinion,fecgxid,t1_febglxa,1578973654.0,"That’s not true.  An employer can say whatever they want about a former employee.  Doing so may create grounds for a lawsuit, generally if the facts reported are in dispute, but there’s no law against saying more than employment dates."
PetRescueExposed,fdkjwmn,t1_fdk25m7,1578505197.0,"I didn’t realize I was defending sketchy shelter practices, I was just pointing out that pit and pit mix are kind of nebulous terms.  According to a study by the university of south Florida’s shelter medicine program pit bull’s are misidentified both ways (false positives AND false negatives) about 50% of the time by shelter staff and vets.  You seem to be arguing that this is universally willfull deception rather than the simple fact that shelters are trying to assign breed labels based entirely on physical appearance with no information on parentage."
aww,fco8h6h,t1_fco5vqi,1577826110.0,"You said cats, not kittens, in your original post.  The risk of kittens becoming obese if free fed is less than adult cats but overeating can cause loose stool.  Better to give the recommended feedings in two to three portions throughout the day."
aww,fco5grm,t1_fco53dd,1577824444.0,Try me.
aww,fco48vw,t1_fcnt4uk,1577823784.0,"Given the number of obese, free fed cats I see in a medium sized veterinary practice, I disagree"
Cushings,fcata5k,t1_fcarzvk,1577576178.0,"Well since I made this post, her endo raised her steroid dosage from 25 mg hydrocortisone daily to 50 mg.  She’s had 3 Addisonian crises since the surgery... the first was two days post op because for some reason they didn’t start her on steroids immediately after the surgery.  The other two were in response to an infection at the surgical site, and the internist raised her from 15 mg to 25 during the third hospital stay.  I also read a study today that said 1/3 of adrenalectomy patients with subclinical Cushings and 99.7%(!) of adrenalectomies with clinical signs of Cushings experience an addisonian crisis post op, so I don’t know if her case is just being managed poorly or if it’s standard practice to try to lowball the dose"
bestoflegaladvice,fc1pnzp,t1_fc1mpud,1577325769.0,My company car is a 2019 Leaf and the range is around 220.  It also has something called pro pilot assist that’s like adaptive cruise control but also steers the car.
