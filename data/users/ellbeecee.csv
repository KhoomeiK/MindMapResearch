LibraryScience,fft79ed,t1_ffrk6tf,1580210662.0,">One of the entrance essays I had to write was to pretend that my GPA slipped below their acceptable threshold. They asked me to elaborate on what steps I would take to bring it back up.

Yeah, this irritated one of my colleagues: they already have a master's in another field and an undergrad in a STEM area, both with high GPAs.  They continued through VSU because we work for a public university in the state and the program is covered through the tuition assistance program.

As someone who works in Georgia, I see a lot of applications from VSU grads when hiring.  Some are excellent, some are terrible, some are fine - but there doesn't seem to be any support in terms of the job search process, even in terms of writing a decent cover letter.

VSU is an accredited program, and I think it's probably fine for people already working in libraries. But if you're not already working in the field, it's going to be tough to make connections to people/experience that will help you get a job coming out. So be prepared to put work in outside of class to make  connections and get experience."
AskReddit,ffp5xqw,t3_eu725g,1580087063.0,"I was at an accounting training seminar, day 2 of a 3 or 4 day thing. Luckily, it was somewhat close to home, so I'd driven. Normally I'd have taken transit to work and even though nothing happened in the city I lived in, they shut the trains down. 

We were just getting started for the day - in the seminar was one person from the military and 2-3 people who lived in NYC.  Someone came down from their hotel room (connected to the training center) and said a plane had hit the WTC.  There was a conversation about the plane that hit the Empire State Building decades ago, and then we started to get ready to get started. 

Shortly after that, the military guy left, and soon after that, everyone moved out into the lobby area to watch the televisions.  We were watching those when the towers fell - I don't remember if we were watching when the second plane hit. 

My boss and a colleague had been in a different seminar, and she told us to go home. Another coworker had been on a plane to NYC that morning, but her plan had landed in Charlotte, and her husband was going to drive from ATL to pick her up and bring her home.

Before I went home, I hit the ATM for some cash and I filled up the car with gas, just thinking that they might be needed. I got home and ended up going to church that evening - I was in  a religious period of life at that point in time. Then I went home and watched tv coverage."

librarians,ffi77h3,t3_etp20i,1579966900.0,"So, it depends - and bear in mind my experience is all in academia, so anything I say about any other type of library is total hearsay. 

We have hired librarians without the masters in areas that are more difficult to hire for - the sciences most specifically. From a hiring standpoint, I had to be willing to ask questions during the hiring process and be willing to train them differently than someone with the MLS.  We did still require an advanced degree in a related field though - we were not about to hire someone who hadn't gotten at least a master's in something, and we encouraged them to take classes in the in-state library program, since that won't cost them anything tuition-wise. 

I've heard that some public libraries in more rural/less desirable places to live are more likely to    be open to hiring without the MLS. For something in a place people want to live, it's going to be near impossible to get a librarian position without the MLS. But there are other staff positions that the bachelor's degree might be helpful in getting."

librarians,fe37zrj,t3_eno755,1578846851.0,"1) stick to the time frame - if they've told you 25-30 minutes, aim for that. You'll likely talk faster when nervous and a LITTLE shorter is generally ok, but if you talk for 10 minutes when they expected 25 .it's a  problem

2) look at the library and university strategic plans, along with those for the departments you'd be working with. Tell them about themselves and how you'll fit into that. 

3) at this point, they likely see that you have the skills to do the job and they want to make sure you can work with them and they can work with you.

4) look at the work they're doing and think about how you can grow that, with a focus on the subject areas"

This. My workplace asks for your transcript once the job offer has been made - that's solely part of degree verification for us, and because central HR requires us to have it.  We used to ask for them (official ones even) as part of the application process, but have stopped that because 1) we don't need them for everyone, just who we hire, 2) we have no business making people pay for transcripts just to apply for the job and 3) The search committee never saw them - they just stayed with HR, so they didn't play selecting candidates at all."

A card like this is likely to get tossed before the conference is done. The dark background means I can't make notes on it about where I met you/why the card might be worth keeping.

Also, ""future librarian"" tells me nothing about your interests as you job hunt - again, this could be mitigated by making it  possible for me to write on the card, but if you're going to leave the dark background, you need to give me something to remember what you're interested in - public libraries?

MaliciousCompliance,fd2mxqr,t1_fd16zhs,1578149511.0,"hahahaha.  Loving to read is NOT a good reason to become a librarian, nor is peace and quiet. I don't remember the last time there was a day in my library that had lots of peace and quiet.  Like people? Like helping people with information in all it's formats? That's a good place to start from. 

If you work in academic (colleges/universities) you'll likely need to be able to teach, do research, deal with university politics, ongoing budget cuts, etc. 

If you work in a public library, you'll need to essentially be a social worker on top of librarian, plus deal with budget cuts, city/town/state politics. 

  
Almost any type of librarian is low paying because it's traditionally ""women's work"" - Melville Dewey hired women as librarians because he could pay them less.
