Teachers,ffe5x0n,t3_et2399,1579837546.0,"There's a BIG difference in what age level you're talking about though. High school, yes a lot of them are assholes. Middle school, nobody's an angel when they're going through puberty but there are definitely some specially bad jerks. But if you're saying you have third graders you actually loathe, that's an issue you've gotta deal with before you step back into a classroom.

 I know how awful some students can be and how unreasonable it is to expect you feel the same about all of them. But I also have been the eleven year old was told by his teacher nearly every day for an entire school year that he was a bad person with no friends and was going to Hell. Less than a year later I tried to kill myself, largely because of the words that teacher had made me believe. Teachers are allowed to have personal opinions, and they may even be justified in some cases, but there's a difference between thinking some kids are assholes and genuinely viewing a child as an enemy."

I've tried Abilify, Risperidone, Chlorpromizine and probably half a dozen others I can't name off without sounding like a bad remix to Mambo No. 5. They all made me exhausted and made my inattention worse, so I swore medication off completely. In hindsight, my bad reactions were probably because it's not a great idea to give the guy with a condition that means he has too little dopamine a type of drug that works solely by reducing dopamine. But Clondine doesn't seem to be an antipsychotic so that might actually work. Thanks!"
Broadway,ffdbnsm,t1_ffd9idi,1579817424.0,"Not to mention Sweeney Todd, one of the best known and liked musicals in history, was originally an urban legend turned book turned more urban legends turned play turned another book turned Bugs Bunny short turned... well you get the picture.

Ideas are rarely new and never exclusive. The idea of ""the original"" is simply inaccurate and so how could they ever be tarnished by adaptation?"
Broadway,ffdar8t,t1_ffd9991,1579816821.0,The original Hairspray wasn't a musical either though.

I'm hugely passionate about eradicating educational inequality, and how better education improves all of society, but it doesn't work on its own. When parents have to leave their kids unsupervised to work three jobs just to pay rent, and the only thing to do for teens to do for fun is drugs or crime, even the best schools can't save them. Educators are working our hardest to do our part, I wish the rest of society did theirs'."

I also have super thick hair and I think it's because I've never had any experience of being able to see my scalp at all that I overreacted and assumed I was balding. Longer hair (like you have on top) will put more stress on the part line, and if you have a cowlick on the front of your head to boot it will give the impression of a receding/thinning hairline. I was freaking out, and was going to start finasteride until I cut my hair short a month ago and realized that it was all an optical illusion and I wasn't balding at all. That being said, I think you've reached the age when guys realize why adult men don't have long hair.

You've been told this by multiple people more than once, and yet this is the exact same survey you posted before. The fact that you are an AP Research student is particularly alarming because this is bad research methodology, and you seem unable to take any criticism.

Teachers,ff3q1xc,t1_ff3nytb,1579546396.0,"Ok, then I understand being very upset and caught off guard initially, but I doubt you have anything to worry about. I would follow others' advice of an online consent lesson and if you can identify the student who actually filmed you then punish them for that, but I wouldn't do anything else. 

As far as the bad legal advice people are giving here (I've worked in the legal field before and know a lot about educational law), there's no legal justification for any kind of action against a student filming you without your permission on school grounds. Public schools are not private property and are considered a public forum in which a person ""has no reasonable expectation of privacy"", according to the Supreme Court. A lawsuit would be extremely expensive for you and would be dismissed as frivolous, or could even be considered a SLAPP suit in which you yourself might face serious repercussions depending on the state."
malehairadvice,ff3o02m,t3_erdjft,1579545139.0,"No. What you see there is a cowlick, which is where the hair changes direction on the scalp. The changing direction gives the appearance of a bald spot and thinner hair around the area the same way it looks like you have a bald line down your hair when you part it. Every human has at least one. For people with thick, straight and dark hair like you, they're going to be more noticeable than on others. You have nothing to worry about."

education,ff3m81w,t1_ff3fcz6,1579544041.0,"What I personally support, although I don't know if it's been researched much or at all, is individual progress focused testing. Students can be given almost the same tests as they're currently being given, but their results are determined by whether they personally have grown from the last testing and are making steady progress, as opposed to comparing them to everyone else. This prevents low-achieving students from being punished for learning because they're still not at statistical average, and more accurately demonstrates the growth of high-achieving students who don't just test higher than their peers, but actually progress faster as well. By analyzing the rate of progress instead of the point value, you can also better identify which students are struggling because they aren't learning what they're being taught, and which students are struggling because their pace is just delayed. Which I believe can help diagnose learning difficulties and implement accommodations/intervention strategies before it's too late."

ADHD,fezplvo,t3_eqy2uv,1579460072.0,"Yes. I echo what everyone else is saying, but another important point is that everybody's ADHD presents differently! Because you only have to have a certain number of symptoms for ADHD in multiple different categories, you may just not have the symptoms that traditionally plummet grades (inability to remember or complete homework is the big one). 

I thought for a long time that because I hate being active, I must not be hyperactive. Turns out liking being active isn't even a diagnostic criteria for hyperactivity - and of the actual criteria I meet all of them.

If he's the type of person to worry about it annoying others he will be especially worried about someone randomly deciding to bring it up just to say that it doesn't bother them.

She should not work anywhere around other people at all honestly, if that's how she treats the people around her.

I would also check in on the student, too and suggest methods of recourse that he can take if he wants (do you have a school social worker. They often are the best line of defense for students in these situations and have a unique advantage over other faculty in getting admin to take student complaints seriously). I know that I would have been beyond consolation if a teacher said that about me - and there were times in high school where I should have been failing and wasn't. That age range can be really rough and I would make at least a brief gesture or comment to the student that the other teacher's actions were inappropriate and offensive and don't reflect how others think of him or he should be treated - however you can without making the situation bigger.

Also, this does not sound like a school you should work at any longer than you physically have to. Start looking for new jobs as soon as you can. Any administration that lets a teacher even get to that level of entitlement and abusiveness is beyond repair and will destroy you from the inside."

Since they've all been shorter term gigs, I've usually avoided it, but when I actually begin teaching in a year-long classroom I definitely plan to. In addition to being a positive tool for compassion and interpersonal education, I really just think children so often do not have any exposure to disabled people or see any positive representation so I want to do my part to combat that. Too many people get to adulthood before they realize disabled people exist in the same world as them.

Even if it's not about accommodations, it's still illegal for her to demand private medical information unless it's needed to excuse an absence from class or something.

AmItheAsshole,fdmmz5y,t3_em32yz,1578556180.0,"NAH. As others have touched on, Grandma probably knows you're some variation of LGBT and was hoping you'd come out. I'm a transgender man (21) and this is my take and input: 

Although you're valid for not coming out, to her it might be coming across as that you don't trust her to be supportive. There's a pretty big difference between coming out as gay and coming out as trans, that makes coming out as trans harder, but it's very hard to put into words, even for queer people, so Grandma is probably relating it to her coming out experience in which her biggest reason not to would probably have been fear of backlash. You not coming out to her might read to her as you not thinking she would be supportive of you, which to another queer person would hurt. Again, you don't have to come out if you aren't ready to, no matter how she feels or how justified her feelings are. 

It's also very very hard to be an old gay person. Most states didn't even decriminalize homosexuality into the 70s, and she's probably faced or witnessed atrocious oppression, that even young queer or trans people now can't imagine. Nearly a generation of gay men and trans women were wiped out by HIV/AIDS and lesbians and trans men were often the the only ones who would take care of them when they were sick, or would bury them when they died. There's a particular trauma to be the only one of a group to survive. Grandma has probably been through a lot and probably is very honored/relieved to have a young queer person to share her stories with and talk about how far rights have come. And unfortunately young queer people are notorious for neglecting their elders, partially because up until recently there weren't any openly queer elders. 

Additionally, there's the part where Grandma probably wants to spend more time with you and this is her way of doing it and you seemingly rejected her.

I would suggest letting her know you'd love to hear her stories sometime, and suggesting some local inter-ages queer events/groups for you to attend together. It would probably mean a lot to her. Also, even if you're not ready to come out yet, asking her to maybe go with you to pick out some clothes of your preferred gender, to subtly integrate into your closeted wardrobe, or casually asking her what opposite gender names might suit you. Casual ways to let her know you appreciate her eventual support and trust her as a guiding force. And when you do decide to come out I would make her one of the first ones."

We decided to call the non-emergency line since nobody else in the surrounding neighborhood seemed to have noticed anything and we didn't want to look like teenagers pulling a prank. Operator answered and after we explained it to her she said ""wait, you're telling me you think an elementary school has been on fire for the past hour and you didn't consider that an emergency?""  


The fire was pretty small, and there was no structural damage, but yeah that was not a smart moment. I've never even told my mother that I'm one of the unnamed sources that alerted the authorities to a fire in a local elementary school. It is a secret my dog and I will take to our graves."

MedicalGore,fd7phgz,t1_fd7nbo1,1578208064.0,"Probably shame and embarrassment tbh. Men tend to let issues with their private areas go untreated longer because it's such a taboo to discuss genitals or butts, especially if you have a male doctor. Especially older men or men of color due to specific social stigmas in their communities. It accounts for most of the deaths from prostate cancer actually because even though it's such a treatable cancer, sometimes people are too embarrassed to seek help if they're having symptoms regarding their genitals, and by the time they relent and get help it's too late. It's quite sad, actually."

Jokes,fd4opek,t1_fd3bcu2,1578169474.0,"Honestly, no. I mean food definitely comes first, but if you're in a city, I only really needed two dollars a day to eat. But phone bill probably comes second, because it's only about $70 a month, and unfortunately in today's day and age you keep or get a job unless you have a phone. And if you don't have a job you can't save up the kind of money you need to get a home. Between 40-60% of the homeless population work at least part time jobs, so they usually make enough to pay a phone bill, but you need a lot of money saved and a better than minimum wage income to get even the crappiest apartments in a city, so that's out of reach. It is very hard to stop being homeless because it is expensive to be homeless and hard to save. Phones are not luxuries anymore - they're necessities, and saving up money for an apartment takes a long time so you have to do what you can to make ends meet and keep work until you get a stroke of luck."
homeless,fd18q5e,t1_fd0aoac,1578128663.0,"I would say also sexual assault and trafficking should fit under that. Unfortunately for women and teens (and everyone to a certain extent), being homeless puts you at a really high risk for experiencing sexual assault and sex traffickers often target homeless populations really heavily. I'd include resources for sexual assault recovery/reporting (most people don't know that it is literally illegal to be billed for a medical exam, sexual assault evidence collection or preventative medications if you go to the hospital after an assault). I'd also include warning signs for sex traffickers and how to avoid them."
Jokes,fd15jeu,t1_fd0zjcx,1578127743.0,"I can say from my experience: I brought my chargers with me. I was kicked out of my house when I was 17, but I had enough time to pack a backpack with necessities, my phone and charger. There are a lot of restaurants/coffee shops that have outlets intended for people to charge their devices while they eat. Most McDonalds have a few, and all Starbucks (that I've been to) have them. I'd hang out in there for long periods of time while I charged my phone. McDonalds couldn't care less how long or little you stay there, and it's often where I'd eat because it's dirt cheap and has lots of calories. Starbucks is less relaxed, but nobody's usually willing to say anything as long as you stay awake and don't bother anyone. As for computers, I was still in high school so I used the computers there, but people without that resource often use public libraries. All cities have at least one (usually dozens) and they have free to use computers that are often frequented by the homeless or poor population that can't afford one. Just another reason why public libraries are such an amazing resource."
Jokes,fd142fm,t1_fd0h0dp,1578127334.0,"Yeah, exactly. I've known a lot of homeless people and not one of them ever expressed great joy at the prospect of sleeping in the loading dock of a CVS for the fifth night in a row. And if they're mentally ill enough to actually want to be homeless, then that's just another reason that they need a place to live that has the resources to support them and get them treatment."
Jokes,fd0fuon,t1_fcztgh7,1578118193.0,"I've also been homeless and I agree. It's like people have been conditioned to think that we're all mentally ill psychopaths trying to rob them. Honestly, the dehumanizing of homeless people I see on social media - through both the people who vilify us and the people who think they're a saint for giving us fifty cents - is sickening."
education,fczemad,t3_ejmjjf,1578099468.0,"Have you been evaluated for or considered the possibility of ADHD? I say this because with smart people, ADHD often goes undiagnosed until adulthood because the typical symptoms of being unable to focus on studying or pay attention in school are masked by the fact that smart people often don't need to study as much or pay attention as closely. Also, people with ADHD don't typically have trouble paying attention to things they're interested in or like. Daydreaming and not being able to take in information from text are very common signs of ADHD, and lack of motivation with things you actually want to do or know you have to do is a common sign as well. Recently I had a similar experience and was diagnosed with severe ADHD, that was hidden for years by the fact that I never really needed to study or pay attention closely before."

crazyexgirlfriend,fcogwb3,t1_fcms73x,1577831940.0,"Yes, you're right. One of the reasons BPD is diagnosed 3 times as often in women is that men are very often misdiagnosed as having Anti-Social Personality Disorder (ASPD) or just ASPD, when really they compound on each other and are comorbid in men very often cause gender roles and all that jazz. Joe probably has both, but his ASPD is secondary to his BPD. You're right that BPD is rooted in fear of abandonment, and if you look at all of the people Joe has killed (based on the books at least, I haven't seen the second season yet), every single murder was rooted in Joe thinking he was being abandoned either for or by that person."
crazyexgirlfriend,fcogmc4,t1_fcna8ux,1577831747.0,"I'd guess Joe probably has BPD in addition to ASPD (specifically the nomadic subtype who are typically the ""charmers"" who fit in anywhere and are shrewd and quick manipulators. They tend to be more depressed than other subtypes). He doesn't fit the criteria for NPD - he has no delusions of grandiosity, he's not envious of others, and his belief he is smarter than others does not reach the level of self-importance that is the defining characteristic of the disorder. He likely has ASPD, although not the psychopathic subtype (psychopathic subtype is characterized by high levels of attention seeking and fearlessness). However, I'd say his most severely presenting disorder is BPD where he fits 8 out of the 9 characteristics (no suicidality). BPD is characterized by intense fear of abandonment and black and white thinking and thinking he's being abandoned and not being able to understand gray areas are literally the root of all of Joe's murders."

crazyexgirlfriend,fckl1j8,t3_ehnqv8,1577727646.0,"I would not say it's a racist or sexist show, but I do think that there are times it can veer in that direction. Rebecca gets away with A LOT, that a POC, or specifically a man of color (men are incarcerated at higher rates and for longer sentences than women because of the sexist stereotype that women are too weak or caring to commit a crime) would not get away with, just because she's cute and white and rich. By all accounts, based on the stuff she did in the first season alone she and Paula should be serving lengthy jail sentences. And I don't think the show ever really addresses how awful the stuff she did to Josh was. If a poor black man moved across the country for a white woman and then stalked her and integrated himself into her life for a year before guilting him into marrying her even after he cheated on her, we would want her to get a restraining order against him and never speak to him again. And if the woman left him at the altar after discovering some of his shady past and the man spread a bunch of malicious lies about her to avoid facing consequences for his actions we would be horrified and want him dead. And I think the show addresses that a bit in the last season with the prison experience (the judge literally didn't accept her guilty plea because she ""looked"" too innocent and didn't have good representation), but it still clouds the show a little bit that we're supposed to forgive her and we're supposed to think Josh is a viable romantic prospect for her even after all she's done to him (and Greg too, tbh. don't date a chick that banged your dad - just, no).   


I don't think the show intends this, and it does realize it eventually, but I think it is worth mentioning, because behavior like hers was not quirky or charming - it was dangerous and abusive - and the only reason she didn't face repercussions from it and was able to receive treatment was because she was a rich, white woman."
GetMotivated,fcat4vn,t1_fca0n9e,1577576094.0,"My unpopular opinion: even if getting proper treatment and being happy meant that Van Gogh never painted again or we never had any art, he should still choose treatment or happiness. The small amount of happiness he brings me with his paintings is not worth more than his entire life. Art brings us joy, and you can't erase the past, but it's never worth the misery or death of others. I think when people talk about how we couldn't have art without mental illness or treatment robs you of creativity (both of which are proven wrong), they're perpetuating the idea that your life is only as useful as the labor you do. I'm a writer and I love what I do, but I don't owe anyone my misery just because it creates the happiness of others.

I would happily take a world without art, literature, poetry or anything if it meant nobody killed themselves again."
