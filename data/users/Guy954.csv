Completely baffled that you’ve somehow contorted your worldview into believing that John McCain, John Bolton and Mitt Romney are secret Democrat agents because they dared question dear leader. 

Confused at how anyone can look at Trump and think for a second that he actually gives a fuck about the American people.  

Astounded at the hypocrisy.
