I know her and I know that she wants me to hide it and bite comments back but you're right, she never explicitely told me to. I'm probably overthinking this as I think you're right, I guess I could say a lot of obviously gay stuff without him getting it. Maybe I could even say ""She's cute, totally my type!"" about a girl on TV without him reacting. I think I'll just have to try how far I can go with that. I just wonder what I'm gonna do if I want to say something like ""I would definitely date her!"" or ""Hot, I wouldn't push her out of bed."" to my family with him in the room because I can't see how he wouldn't get *that.* And I guess my grandma would be displeased if I really said that with him being able to hear it but whatever. I guess she'll have to settle with me not explicitely coming out to him but if I were to say something as obvious as above then I don't really want to hold back just because of what he might think. That's okay and not selfish, is it? I mean, being bi is a part of me - and not only when I'm currently in a same-sex relationship."
aww,ffgf6f7,t1_fffser7,1579904867.0,That's exactly why I wanna have rabbits. I could sit next to them and share my salad and carrots with them while petting and cuddling them. I'm pretty sure that's the true meaning of life.
bisexual,fffddcg,t3_et2ebv,1579881484.0,I love how even the pumpkin is admiring the colors.
bisexual,fffcjj5,t3_et7zb3,1579880963.0,"I'd probably just give her a deadline. Don't be confrontational about it and try to explain to her why it's so important to you but also clearly tell her that she'll have to tell them until x date (next Sunday, for example) if she wants to tell them first because after that you'll go and talk to them no matter if she's told them or not."
interestingasfuck,fff9n79,t1_fff8bng,1579879114.0,"Elephant awareness is definitely a thing but this is not an example of it. The elephant is trained, you can see the man on the right giving him commands. Also, he's got a bull hook in his hand for stabbing it into the elephants skin to hurt him and make him obey. That's probably how they learned this trick, too."
aww,fff0mhy,t3_et8agj,1579872377.0,My theory: It's a cat in disguise.
vegan,ffetk2f,t1_ffet87n,1579864868.0,"That doesn't make sense since humans are animals. Or are you trying to say that it's okay to hurt other species as long as you're nice to your own? So it would be totally ok if another species stronger and more intelligent than us (maybe from another planet) came and started to lock us into cages, rape us, torture us, take our children away and rape us again so we could produce more for them and kill us before reaching adulthood? I guess that would be perfectly fine to you if someone came and did this to you, then. I mean, I definitely wouldn't like that."
aww,ffesh0v,t3_et5pja,1579863369.0,At first glance this was cute but it's gonna be a downvote because of the bull hook since torturing elephants is not very aww in my opinion.
bisexual,ffbtfvl,t1_ff9kggb,1579782109.0,"Awesome :D

I'm already through with all four volumes and I loved them. But they still have some mistakes and typos in them so you might wanna watch out for that, especially when it comes to the vocabulary lists."
