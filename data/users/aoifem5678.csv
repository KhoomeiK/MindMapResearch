Weightlosstechniques,fff1jk5,t3_esi6kb,1579873148.0,Your body weight will vary day to day depending on exercise and what you ate the precious day. Try weighing yourself in a week.
Weightlosstechniques,fff1gcv,t3_et1dlg,1579873074.0,"This doesn't ring true for me. Your body already has a natural detoxing system - your kidneys. You said that calories aren't to blame for weight gain, but this thing suppresses your appetite, which means you eat less calories. Water also suppresses your appetite. Also, this sounds like something you should only take if your doctor tells you it's harmless."

AmItheAsshole,ff1yjiv,t3_eqzf0e,1579489136.0,"NAH. Speaking as someone in a similar situation (half American but born and raised in Ireland), it's okay to feel more attached to your country of birth than to the one your parents are from. I feel much more patriotic towards Ireland than the US. I celebrate St. Patrick's Day instead of the 4th of July, Thanksgiving is celebrated but Christmas is more important, and I can't sing a word of 'America the Beautiful' but I know every word to 'The Fields of Athenry'. However, even though my mother has never been upset at my cultural identity, I would understand if she wanted me to be more American. Immigration or being the child of immigrants can be hard and sometimes I feel bad for negating my 'patriotic duty'. It must be much worse for my mother. Your wife probably feels alienated from her culture and wants to keep it alive through her children."
