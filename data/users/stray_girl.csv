belowdeck,ffzy64b,t1_ffzpw8g,1580395887.0,"Ugh I can't believe I'm going to defend Tanner here because he disgusts me, but Simone didn't get used - she put herself in that situation. She agreed all along that it was a meaningless hook up, even though it was obvious to us viewers that she had feelings for Tanner. She tried to play it cool and wasn't honest about her feelings for him. If she had told him she actually had feelings for him and he hooked up with her anyway, knowing he didn't feel the same way, that would have been using her. That's not what happened.

paralegal,ffxy8ul,t1_ffxuogn,1580334776.0,I had a client once come in for a discovery meeting and the receptionist told me he was there and looked like he wasn't feeling well. He sat in the waiting room about ten minutes and I went to greet him and asked if he was OK. He said he thought he was having a heart attack and could we reschedule? I wanted to call 911 and he kept insisting I not call and he left. Turns out he drove himself to the hospital and was indeed having a heart attack.

Otherwise, yeah, you're gonna have to call. You can call the EDI department and you won't be on hold long at all. It's  646-458-6740.

These are the different kinds of logins you can have. Yours is probably the AD. At some point when your firm set up their account, they assigned an AR and an AM.  You need to find out the login for the AM. The attorney will be the AR.

&#x200B;

 Account Representative (AR)

The AR, which applies to corporate accounts only, is the individual in the organization who has the legal authority to bind the organization to a contract and the terms of MSPRP requirements. This is usually a senior executive/partner of the company/firm. Although the AR will not have direct access to the MSPRP application and cannot be a user on the portal, the AR initiates account registration (or designates another person to perform this task), receives the ""Personal Identification Number"" or PIN for the account, provides the PIN to the AM, and signs the Profile Report. The AR has ultimate accountability for the information submitted on the MSPRP. The AR must approve the organization's profile during the initial account setup and through any subsequent changes. An individual may be the AR for other MSPRP corporate accounts. However, the AR cannot be a user with a login ID for any MSPRP account (i.e., cannot be an AR for an account and registered as an AM or AD for that account or any other MSPRP account).

Please refer to the Data Use Agreement in the MSPRP User Manual to make sure the person named as the entity's AR has the authority to sign this agreement.

The AR information will be submitted during Step 1 - New Registration.

### Account Manager (AM)

Each MSPRP account must assign an AM. The AM is established during the Account Setup process. Each MSPRP account can only have one AM. This is the individual that will manage your account recovery case workload. This includes managing other user's access to those cases on a day-to-day basis. Your AM is also responsible for updates to your account information including address changes and replacing your AR if needed.

Your AM will obtain a Login ID and be a regular user of the site. An AM may complete tasks related to recovery cases on the MSPRP and invite other users to register and function as ADs associated to your account. Each account may have only one AM.

Under a Representative account, the AM can assign the AM role to another person.

Under a Corporate account, the AR designates the AM. The AR cannot be the AM or be a user of the MSPRP system. The AR and AM must be different people.

**Note:** You can have multiple roles across different accounts. For example, you can be an AM on one account and an AD on another. Also, an AM can change the role of an AD on a current account to an AM by contacting an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Representative by phone at (646) 458-6740 or e-mail at: [COBVA@GHIMedicare.com](mailto:COBVA@GHIMedicare.com) for assistance.

**The Account Manager information will be submitted during Step 2 - Account Setup.**

**Account Designee (AD)**

ADs assist the AM with the case recovery process. Your AM may, but is not required to, invite individuals to register as an AD and become users of the MSPRP associated with your account. Each MSPRP account may have multiple ADs. The number of ADs associated with one MSPRP account is dependent on the account type. Corporate accounts may have up to 100 ADs. Representative accounts may have up to 5.

An AD must be invited by an AM in order to obtain a Login ID and gain access to your account on the MSPRP. Once an AM has invited an AD to the account, the system will issue an e-mail to the AD with instructions on how to register and access the account on the MSPRP. ADs may perform most tasks related to working with recovery cases on the MSPRP, but they may not invite other users or update general account information. ADs can be associated to multiple MSPRP accounts using a single Login ID. After logging onto the MSPRP, ADs will be presented with a list of accounts to which they have been granted access by the applicable AMs. The AD will then select the account that pertains to the recovery case they wish to work on."

I tell them to answer EACH AND EVERY HIGHLIGHTED question, to write the answers directly on the page under the question and to leave no highlights blank. I tell them they can submit additional pages if they need more space but every question must be answered. I also make it clear that the information is only for our office and it will not go to the defense until we have typed it up and finalized it with them, so they need to give as much information as possible and we will object to anything inappropriate. I also say if they don’t know the answer to a question, that’s ok, but they need to say they don’t know or they can’t remember.

\#2 is - Take your lunch break every day. Do not work when you are not getting paid. Get out of the office for lunch and take an entire hour at least 3 times per week. You will slowly go insane if you don't. You have to have breaks. We all do.

\#3 is - Remember that you are only human and also that you are NOT the lawyer, nor are you the lawyer's babysitter. Ultimately you can only do the best you can do. Document everything. If a lawyer is misplacing documents and blaming it on you, keep notes of ""Gave file to XX on DATE."" Then when she blames you, ""My notes say I gave the file to you on \_\_\_\_."" When she gives you instructions, repeat them to her. ""Just so I'm clear, you want me to do x, y, and z."" Do this via email when possible so you have a record.
