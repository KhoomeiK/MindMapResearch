It is pretty obvious that not killing the dragon means *certain death* for her and her friends. Sure she can't leave the room in any way, but as long as the dragon remains a threat to her life I would think she could still attack it. I think the command Troy *should* have given is ""Leave this room for all time."" That way there's no question of whether or not it's self-destructive.

Also, it comes with a guide that you put around your phone when you place the protector on so it's nice and square.

I had a hair find its way between the screen and protector somehow. I pulled the protector off, cleaned my screen, rinsed the protector, let it dry and it stuck back to my phone with no issues.

Mind you it's not cheap. I think it was 50 or 60 bucks. But it's got a great replacement plan if it breaks. I dropped my phone on the concrete flat on it's face and shattered the protector.

We find a little island to pull up to that's got some small trees and brush for cover and I jump out asap because it's an emergency at this point.

Relief washes over me as I unroll some of the TP-in-a-zip-lock grandpa handed before I had jumped into the lake. 

I look behind me, and right there next to the pile I had made was a big straw nest with 3 baby blue herons just like the one in the picture.

Yes, they did mess up the dominate person spell. Though not in the way you're stating. Dominate person only works on humanoids. Fetchling/Kayal do not have the humanoid subtype. By the rules dominate person should not have worked on her *at all*. 

Either way, it was not on purpose that they messed up the rule for it. It was completely unintentional. If anyone had realized the mistake Troy would have directed it at someone else. It was human error. They weren't choosing to ignore the rules out of convenience.

Edit: spelling"
TheGlassCannonPodcast,fee84kh,t1_fee5cyt,1579028360.0,"I agree. I'm just not sure what it has to do with this situation. Are you suggesting that Troy ignored some of the rules of the game? What rules did he throw out? I don't recall any purposeful violations. Is there a rule that says the Dragon *must* kill everyone instead of handing them over to the Giants?

Dragons are intelligent creatures, capable of thought, and reasoning. Maybe the Dragon could have killed them all but not without taking quite a bit of damage before succeeding. Or maybe the Dragon didn't like his odds and decided to punk them out instead of taking the chance that the remaining PC's get the better of him.

My point is: Did Troy pull a punch, and choose not to kill a character when he maybe could have, for the sake of story? Absolutely. Did Troy brake any rules of the game by doing so? Absolutely not."

>Barron has become too big to kill off

Maybe you're on to something there. But I don't think Troy would have hesitated if he hadn't messed up the dominate person spell. He would have targeted someone else with dominate person and that would have had a butterfly effect on what everyone else chose to do. It could have been anyone else staring down the barrel of an invisible dragon. I just think Troy didn't wanted to kill off the longest living PC on what may have been a technicality.

""So it's this BIG black lady's turn and you just know what food she's going for-""

I roll my eyes, look at P, he's not mad per se just disappointed, so we just walk off right out of the bar. The dude is saying ""Naw, come in guys. Don't walk off. I'm sorry."" Like what the fuck?"

I knew it was a bottled water before your link which is why I hate it so irrationally. Even if it wasn't already bottled water I'd think to myself ""Awkwafina? So fucking stupid.

Most people don't remember much from 1-10, and even if you do and it was good it was still under your parents roof/rules. 15 you start rebelling, becoming your own person, wanting to do things on your own terms. There's no such thing as hangovers, parties every weekend, sleeping is optional, full head of hair... Ignore that last bit."

What? Only >!1 character died by episode 50!< During the first boss fight in Dead Suns that is notorious for oitright TPK's in other games. What do you mean nonsensical?

>episodes that are nothing but rolling dice

Yeah, it's called combat. RPG's have that. They're playing an RPG. You could fast forward through the combats, I suppose but then what the point in listening to an actual play RPG podcast? 

Troy does a masterful job injecting personal stories of the PC's into the main story line. Sometimes writing amazing cutscenes for each of them. The last one gave me goosebumps, as they often do."

OB ""Oh, yeah. I guess I am! I just never thought about it before when I dated all those women.""

Boom! Representation achieved. Apparently."
