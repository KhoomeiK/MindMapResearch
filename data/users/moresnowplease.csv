Aquariums,ffvfhr3,t3_ev3077,1580262899.0,Not sure about the fading? I know they can grow barbels back again- I got a Cory from someone who was moving and the poor little fella had been housed with cichlids for about a month and had no barbels and no webbing left on his dorsal fin- everything did grow back eventually!

Aquariums,ffvbpgh,t1_ffv90oo,1580260354.0,"Me too!! That’s why I’m guessing she might be carrying a whole bunch of eggs at the moment. But also I’m really unsure of their reproductive cycle, as they aren’t known for home aquarium breeding. As I said earlier, I don’t expect to actually get any babies or even visible eggs in this process, as this is a community tank with other hungry fishes, plus the whole “don’t know how Otos reproduce” thing.. haha! She’s definitely not wasting  away or starving!!"
Aquariums,ffvbgxh,t3_ev770t,1580260193.0,"AGA international aquascaping contest has galleries of past participants for the past 20 years of contests. Some incredible tanks on there, I got overwhelmed with awe and inspiration! And then threw some rocks and sticks and anubias in a tank together with some sand and gravel. Some fish rescape everything for themselves anyways! Haha! Often worth thinking about what habitats your fish are from (do they need caves? Are they from rocky places or leafy places?) or whether they eat/rip up plants (goldfish, cichlids, etc)."
Aquariums,ffv8s5c,t1_ffuax38,1580258388.0,I’ve done almost all my tanks fish in cycles. Only some of them did I have beneficial bacteria to use and add in. I just did a lot of small water changes.

Aquariums,ffv5opp,t3_ev7sg5,1580256279.0,"Does it look all open in the whole white area? There is a gland right behind the dorsal fin that can sometimes get weird fatty deposits, some folks have suggested from too much protein in their diet, but I’m on a phone screen so can’t see the photo very well. I only mention that due to the location of the top part of this mark."

Aquariums,ffulyzr,t1_ffui6oj,1580244771.0,"Green Cory’s are not aeneus, unless what you have is actually bronze Cory’s. Most green/emerald Cory’s are c. “Brochis” splendens and are larger than most Cory’s, have pointier snout, and the easiest way to tell the difference is the brochis have more dorsal rays (10+ rays instead of the 7 that other Cory’s have). That being said, my green and bronze Cory’s school together all the time! Like all day every day. :) Out of the five Cory species I have, these are the only two that will school together like this, but they’re also the most similar in color and mannerisms.  Not sure what might help your albinos feel better, though. Keep watching and do a few extra water changes just to be safe!"

Aquariums,ffukyu9,t1_ffuk674,1580244154.0,"Heck, I haven’t had any of my 30+ Cory cats lay any eggs in the last year and a half! Unless the eggs have all gotten eaten by cohabitating loaches!"
Aquariums,ffukstb,t1_ffuk674,1580244053.0,"I have also heard this. I have absolutely no expectations that any eggs will appear!  I know other hard to breed at home fish (like kuhliis) often become egg laden and then reabsorb the eggs, I am guessing this is likely what will happen!  There are a total of 8 Otos in this tank that have been in there for about a year and a half, and this one has always been much larger than the rest! She’s now even larger than usual!"
Aquariums,ffujn8n,t1_ffuj1qo,1580243357.0,"With my kuhliis (and Cory cats), easiest method was a bottle trap- 2 liter bottle with the top cut off and inverted. Put tasty snacks in there (helps if the fish haven’t eaten for a little while). If one goes in, wait and watch before removing one. Seems to me that if one is already in there, the others will be more likely to follow! I can usually catch at least half of the kuhliis in about 5-10min. sometimes takes longer."

GetMotivated,ffueja5,t1_fftjzou,1580240290.0,"What helps some people may not help others- having things like this from friends did help me when struggling with depression, even if they seemed cheesy or cliche to others.  It's difficult to know what exactly someone else needs/wants to hear from an outside perspective.  All I can do is try!   We took geology and geography classes together in college about 15 years ago, so at least it being a rock has a significance related to our history together. :)  Finding this rock made me really happy when I first found it, as I was struggling with depression at the time, so passing it along does mean something to me.  This was not the only item I sent, so hopefully if this particular small sentiment isn't received well, my friend's feelings won't be hurt by a completely failed attempt at long distance support."

CasualConversation,ffs4lhy,t3_euqfaj,1580172997.0,"i often offer to take group/couples photos of people who are obviously travelling together but taking single photos of each other in cool/touristy places.   they're usually quite pleased,  i don't think anyone has ever turned me down, and often they'll offer to take my photo as well! most folks just don't want to bother anyone else that is enjoying whatever the sights are!  we have a lot of drive through coffee stands in my town and if i have extra cash, i like paying for the person behind me. even more fun when people do a chain buy and pass it on to the next person behind them- sometimes the coffee stands reports that it happens for hours! So cool!!

I also enjoy keeping a few chocolates in my pocket around christmas time and handing them to cashiers, post office employees, etc.

Edit to add: my favorite help another human moment was at an airport where we had to walk down a rather long flight of stairs with baggage between international transits and a mom was traveling alone with her 2-3yr old kiddo and struggling to carry her luggage as well as the kid- i walked over and offered to carry it down for her- the look of relief on her face absolutely made it worth it for me!!"

Aquariums,ffr9z1z,t1_ffm7zni,1580153669.0,i'm trying this tactic now with one of my cichlids. hoping everyone else will rearrange and eventually can put this jerk back in with them. though he's actually pretty awesome by himself.  he's quite personable and seems to be pretty dang intelligent. doesn't hurt that he's quite pretty.  definitely tore up all plants right away (initially planned that tank to be for a betta).

funny,ffr6a9r,t1_ffnisot,1580151377.0,probably because stale cereal is not as tasty as fresh cereal.  get fancy lidded reusable containers for cereal and put the bags in them for longer shelf life in humid places- you may have less trouble being allowed to open more kinds at once!

Aquariums,ffb71ph,t1_ffat1g2,1579753526.0,"I started with two three spot gourami from the local petco adoption tank (they were already adults). They bickered over territory, I didn’t have a lot of hiding spots or territory defining decor, and I hadn’t done any gourami research before taking them home. I removed the more aggressive one to a QT tank so I could take him back to the adoption tank the next morning but he jumped ship overnight and I didn’t find him in time. The other three spot gourami, Cirrus, is absolutely one of my favorite fish, lost him for three days and finally found him sideways under a large rock that I thought was flat on the substrate- I quickly removed all rocks from over top of where he was stuck and he was a little bruised but ok! Now one end of the tank is covered with a solid cover so he has a shaded area that is still open water- he was scared to hide under anything or in any tight spots for a little while! I think the other gourami would have been just fine in his own large tank without another identical male to fight over territory with! Cirrus and the more mellow of my two angelfish are now best buddies (same happened with the two angels, but I thankfully had an extra larger tank for the more aggressive angel this time around). They differ in personality like bettas do- some are mellow sweethearts and some are a little more protective of their space! They’re great fish!"
