blogsnark,ff72mxg,t1_ff719vt,1579639887.0,"One of my dearest friends and mentors is in her late 70s now. 

In the early 80s, she started a relationship with a recently divorced man. These details get crazy, please stay with me here. 

The man had recently divorced the mother of his two kids. There was never any cheating, no relationship overlap, no homewrecking. My dear mentor had nothing to do with the divorce. But the two women? My mentor and the ex wife? They had worked together. 

The relationship between my mentor and the guy fizzled out a few months later, sometime in 1981. 

In 2012 they started dating again. He's a crazy abusive piece of shit but that's a different story. 

They've been on and off since 2012. The ex wife never got over the guy, though. Never really lived a full happy life after the divorce. 

Couple of weeks ago, the two women ended up in the same place at the same time for the first time since the 80s. The ex wife assaulted my mentor. 

Her crazy, misplaced anger never went away and culminated in two elderly women getting in a fighting match in public. 

Whatever agony Heather has caused, the actual disaster of adultery and divorce, will never go away for those other women. I have no respect for her."

She's sort of built her identity on going against the grain - especially with escaping the Mormon church.

When Leta was born, a friend of mine linked me to her blog for the frog baby story. I started reading, really didn't mind her for awhile. 

It's hard to pinpoint when the annoyance started. Maybe when one of her books was just blog posts copy/pasted and bounded. Around nine years ago I had an encounter with her at work, which I can't really talk about here to protect my own privacy - her reaction to not getting a position she wanted set the tone for my attitude towards her. 

I had NO IDEA she was talked about on Reddit until recently. I googled something like ''dooce reddit'' and I've been here since. Literally almost sixteen years of being fed up with this woman and I've finally found y'all"
