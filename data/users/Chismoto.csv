Seriously, I do actually like that tool, not Pompeo. I never really liked the pasta attachment, have never really gotten used to using it. I'd rather use a hand operated shaper. I do really make a variety of sausage. I once hosted a party with the second wife and made a venison sausage that people just couldn't get enough of. I had made baguettes and then blended the sausage with this cream cheese and herb blend that I whomped (you can probably identify me by the use of that word but shush) up. She had invited her boss and he showed up with his wife; she must have eaten an entire baguette (thinly sliced and then toasted and then smeared with the sausage mix) by herself.

I walked in and she asked me to close the door. She looked mortified. She told me that she was looking online for a black pearl necklace. I couldn't keep a straight face.

The point of the impeachment and the trial in the Senate revolves around 2 particular questions. Did the President do something for his own particular gain? Did he coerce the government of another country to interfere in our elections for his own personal gain? I personally think he did, you may disagree but the facts stand as they are. According to the people involved in this whole sordid affair, the ones we have been allowed to hear from at least, he did. And then he blocked the congress from hearing from other people who had intimate knowledge of things from testifying before Congress. Since I believe that he is a lying corrupt wantabe I would be more than happy to see him removed from office; actually I can't believe he was ever elected. Not that I ever liked Hillary Clinton."

gifs,ff32jjd,t1_ff2zn7o,1579532003.0,"Okay, let's unpack that.

You seem to be intent on the belief that I was trying to offend you with my original comment and further discussion. This is not the case.

My original comment stemmed from my own history. Once upon a time I was young and extremely fit. If I was 4000 years younger, obvious exaggeration, and knew her I would have asked her out. If she said no I would go on with my life. Because my mom would have slapped me upside the head if I was so foolish as to press my attention on a woman. But also because it was the right thing to do.

My appreciation is a different perspective. Your specious argument about people being unwell is just that, specious. Anyone can try to better their health. Whether it is spending time in a gym or just going for a daily walk. Or eating well. You seem to equate my appreciation of this girls appearance with denigration of others. I'm wondering why that is.

Also your use of the word innocuous in this context seems to try and lessen the worth of my own words. Why did you do this?"
gifs,ff2xiop,t1_ff2vx7h,1579527774.0,"Okay that is a lot to unpack so let's start from the beginning. 

I am a random stranger from the internet so my comment should have no affect on your mental well being. Am I in any way responsible for your perception of what I said?

As far as her appearance goes why should that matter to you? You be you. Don't worry about other people.

As far as her commitment to what she does that is what she has chosen to do. Why should I judge her? Well I shouldn't.

I can appreciate the results of her hard work just like I can appreciate a sunrise. I did nothing to make either come about. I can still say that they are pretty. Sure, I'm making a judgement but I'm not judging you."
gifs,ff2q9ug,t1_ff2iwso,1579519091.0,Are we arguing? This young lady has obviously taken great care of her personal appearance and her costume. The pretty in my comment refers to that.
