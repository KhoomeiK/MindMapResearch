It may surprise you to find out that roads are regularly designed for the average travel speed and not the actual posted speed.

For example, per IMSA guidance, the time given for yellow lights (time for a car to clear the intersection from a stop bar at speed) is based on the average traffic study speed, not the posted speed limit.

Thats your statement right? Since the dawn of civilization there have been peoples where women had rights where there were male slaves who got none. Turns out that people in power just prefer to keep others away from it. This isnt always based on sex. You should also note civilizations who served under queens, fought, and died for them while the queen (a woman) enjoyed many more rights and privileges. 

As for men abandoning women, what does that have to do with me and the current state of things? Family courts clearly discriminate against men currently. It needs to stop. Its been over half a century since women have fully entered the workforce and got the means to support themselves. Women still advocate for preventing automatic 50/50 parenting standards and ending forever alimony. Id also like to add that discrimination to ""solve societal problems"" isnt a reasonable justification. That line of thinking is detestable. ""How will society operate if we lose our free labor force?! You cant free the slaves!""

And again, you failed to touch on the fact that men are sentenced in criminal cases much, much more harshly than women for the same crimes. You got any more of them justifications for that?

Are/were women discriminated against? Sure. But discrimination isnt exclusive as you seem to imply. Turns out anyone can be discriminated against. Even men! And even men need their interests advocated. Weird right?"
