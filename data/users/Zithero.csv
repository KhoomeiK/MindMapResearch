nottheonion,ffekrg6,t1_ffej0mt,1579852169.0,"Shares are supposed to represent a value in the company and are supposed to be investments from outside shareholders.

Health of the company considering their debit to asset ratio, netsales, and other factors affect the stock value... 

When a company has a whole lot of liquid assets (cash) normally they reinvest into the business.  They do so a number of traditional ways:
Increasing compensation for workers
Investing in R&D
Maintence/replacing older tooling, equipment, workstations, etc...
Some even give cash dividends to current shareholders.


However a new trend, well not new... but a resurgent trend has been to, instead of just investing in innovation or the employees... to buyback stocks in order to improve shareholder satisfaction. 

The logic here is that, if the company has so much cash, it's doing well... the return on investment they would get from reinvesting in the business pales in comparison to the return of buying their own stock... which has the benifit of boosting the stock value (netting them more capital)."
