So RAW, no AoO, ever. 

Also, a lot of spells require the target to be someone you can see. (I guess a familiar could help you around that like Shakasta, but that requires GM fiat since it’s an action to look through your familiar’s eyes). 

This would require some hand waving by the DM, no matter how you build (unless you’re ok being mechanically worse off than the rest of the table).

Edit: also, can I ask why your character would choose to remain blind in a world where magic can easily cure them? Even if it’s too expensive to buy a spell casting as a commoner, by the time you’re level 3 your party healer can cure you or you could afford a lesser restoration casting at a temple.

As far as not disclosing your significant other, we seem to disagree. If not disclosing your partner seems to be a reoccurring problem with how a person makes friends, they should probably start disclosing their partner. Beyond that, it’s pretty fucked up to hide your significant other for 3 weeks when meeting someone of the opposite sex. My wife is unusually one of the first things I talk about.

As soon as I found out about them, I completely cut off contact, because I knew I couldn’t be just a friend to her; I loved her too much. I also knew it was disrespectful and unfair to her, her boyfriend, and myself to try and get in between them.
