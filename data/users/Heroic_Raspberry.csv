worldnews,ffa1mn5,t1_ff9vx1t,1579726070.0,"1956 was a year of rebellion and desire for independence from the Soviet Union in Hungary. It was the first time it happened, so many people thought that the good Communists would respect the will of the people and let them. Instead what the Hungarians got were Russian tanks which killed the insurgency. 

It was a pivotal moment for many European Communists. Most were appalled and stopped supporting the Soviet Union, but many said that it was necessary to maintain the socialist revolution, and that the Hungarian counter-revolution was a capitalist plot. The latter later became known as tankies.

It also became a trend for the Soviet Union to park tanks everywhere to make sure people wouldn't do it again. Modern day tankies generally support the use of deadly force to maintain a socialist state."

You may have seen me poking  around our Discord channel on occasion, or here on the forms in the last  Dev Diary. Today I am here with the next installment in the Lifestyles  series, where I will be talking about Lifestyle Events.  
   
>  
>We have already covered a good deal of how Lifestyles work from a  systemic point of view, but how do they influence your character’s  story? What does your Lifestyle mean to your ruler beyond some bonus  skill points and a handful of perks?  
   
>  
>Much like in CK2, when you pick a Lifestyle Focus you will begin getting  events related to that Focus. Unlike in CK2, however, these events are  not mere stepping stones toward acquiring a Lifestyle Trait, as that  progression is handled by the perk system. Instead, Lifestyle Events in  CK3 represent the various opportunities (or crises!) that have arisen as  a result of the extra time and attention your ruler has been devoting  to their Focus.  
   
>  
>For example, if you pick the ‘Stewardship - Domain’ Focus, you will  begin receiving events about the management of your ruler’s domain and  the holdings within it. You can choose to be strict or lenient, fair or  corrupt, generous or greedy, etc. While there is rarely a ‘correct’  answer, the choices you make here will influence the prosperity of your  realm, the size of your treasury, and how your ruler will be remembered  in history books.

>  
>Then again, you might prefer to take the ‘Intrigue - Temptation’ Focus,  where you will receive events about seduction, desires, and covertness.  You can lead your courtiers and vassals on, manipulating them into doing  favors for you or interceding with others on your behalf. You can  sustain long-term affairs, planting agents in foreign courts who will do  your bidding when the time is right. Or, just maybe, you’re simply the  type of person who wants to have a good time, seducing every lady or  lord you desire, indulging in a wild revelry of stress-relieving  hedonism and debauchery? The choice is yours to make!

>There are many more Focuses besides these two, of course, such as  ‘Learning - Scholarship’, where you will get the chance to delve into  old books to study natural philosophy and run questionable experiments —  here you can decide just how far you will go in the search for  knowledge, and if it is worth it to push the boundaries of church  doctrine to discover the secrets of nature...

>...as well as the more practical ‘Diplomacy - Family’ Focus, where your  attention to your family will give you opportunities to improve  relations between relatives, enhance the prestige of your dynasty, and  even take a more active role in molding your heir to be a worthy  successor for your great legacy!

>  
>In addition, your rulers are savvy individuals (or would at least like  to think so); they won’t just single-mindedly pursue their Focus at the  expense of all else. You will also receive occasional events pertaining  to other Focuses within the same Lifestyle, representing various  opportunities you have discovered that you weren’t necessarily pursuing,  but would still be foolish to ignore. This will help mix things up a  little and make keeping the same Focus for a long time more interesting.  
   
>  
>Taken all together, Lifestyle Events become an integral part of the  Lifestyles system in CK3 that define how your current ruler lives their  life and what impact that has on their realm and dynasty. Many of the  choices you will have to make have both pros and cons, which means what  you decide to do as one ruler may be very different from what you do as  another. Since each of your rulers will have different reasons for  picking a Focus, this will lead to varied and interesting gameplay  across multiple generations, as each subsequent ruler is presented with a  wide variety of new and changing situations to take advantage of in  pursuit of their ambitions.

It's totally hypocritical, considering how Saudi Arabia has done a lot more influence operations in Sweden through being the sole funder of radical mosques and salafaist movements. China has just forcibly said ""stfu please"" at several points in comparison, and not actually affected internal politics."

>Tomorrow Tuesday the 21st of January 2020 we’ll release a patch for EU4  called 1.29.4. As this patch will seemingly do nothing for you except  change the version number and checksum we thought we should explain  what’s going on.  
   
>  
>We are running a few experiments aimed at reducing the threshold for new  players to access the full EU4 experience. We are approaching this in a  data-driven way, somewhat related to what we did in CK2 a few years  back (and that test turned out great when it comes to growing the CK2  family around the globe!); which means that we cannot fully disclose how  exactly it will look, as that will interfere with the test. What we can  say is that it’s fully and completely optional and does not require you  to interact with it in any way.   
   
>  
>We hope that these experiments do not negatively impact your game  experience, but, since updates have the potential to cause unforeseen  effects, it is important that you know what is happening.  
   
>  
>Tomorrow’s patch changes nothing that should affect mod compatibility.  Mods that worked on 1.29.3 should work with no problems on 1.29.4.  However, if a mod has specified 1.29.3 as it’s level of compatibility it  will say it is outdated in the launcher, even if in reality it would  work as normal. Hopefully your mods already have 1.29.\* compatibility  specified in which case there should be no effect whatsoever. If they  are not though: it should be completely safe to run the mods anyway."

PoliticalPhilosophy,ff30mkg,t1_ff300ar,1579530483.0,"Just remember that Marx didn't really give any explanation to how things should work in practice, just in theory and principle and how it should be in the future state of communism, and not on the way there! You might want to look at specific examples from the Soviet Union and Maoist China or other communist states on how property rights were handled. In general, small scale ""mom's n pops"" businesses and relatively expensive personal objects such as cars and houses were allowed and part of the economy, but larger and more valuable than that and it kinda became too big to be private property.

PS:

Also, regarding your second question: the Lieberman reforms of the 1960s solved many production-related issues which couldn't be handled by the first forms of plan economy (and Marxes theories regarding value creation) of the Soviet union. The Lieberman reforms introduced a sort of simulated market, which then became popular in all socialist states.

If not, we will fall into a new dark age and regress as a species. 

An ageing population isn't an issue as modern technology and medicine makes it easier and more enjoyable for more people to work longer. Gone are the days of physically tiresome toiling in industry, and instead social interaction in a complex economy. This has space for almost anyone to find enjoyment in participation.

Therefore overpopulation is a larger issue, as it poses an existential crisis."

sweden,ff2sf6i,t1_ff2raus,1579522135.0,"> Ibland verkar det nästan som att svenska skolan av politiska skäl har försökt framställa ""svearna"" som ett annat folk än ""svenskarna"", trots att ""svensk"" bara är adjektivformen av ""svee"" (svear i singular). Svear blev till svenskar på samma sätt som daner blev till danskar och norrmän blev till norskar. En språklig förändring som inte antyder någonting om kulturell kontinuitet. På Island heter vi fortfarande ""svear"".

Mm, men det blir svårt över tusentals år av namnbyten, härmningar och folkförflyttningar att veta vad som är en egentlig fortsättning av någonting annat o vad som bara tagit över namnet. T.ex. ""Turkiska Rom"", föregångaren till Osmanska riket. Eller det västgötska kungadömet i spanien, och de nordgermanska suearna som erövrade portugal runt 300-talet. Svårt att säga om svearna för två tusen år sen har större anknytning till moderna portugal eller moderna sverige."
