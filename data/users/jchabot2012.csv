bipolar2,fenautq,t3_eq04ka,1579280731.0,I was in and out of jail until I was 21. I was mandated to take substance abuse counseling via probation. I didnt want to go back to jail on a probation violation so of course I lied about my using of drugs. Now that I'm 32 and realized I'm bi-polar it still angers me that i had to hide from the justice department and not get better honestly. Good for you. If we're not honest then I dont think we are able to get the best care we deserve.

stopdrinking,fejm4dz,t1_feidm61,1579179527.0,I feel the people shaming people are just jealous. It's like telling someone they only volunteer so they can tell people they do it.

Charges dropped against those officials responsible for the lead and the covering up of the real lead results...  
How can you be a citizen in Flint and trust anyone? The police misappropriated money, health official cover ups, and racism. Anyone that already didn't hate government/police sure do now. How much money is spent on this investigation that Flint already doesn't have? This doesn't only affect Flint. It will set a precedent for neighboring communities and keep dividing the gap between black/brown/white/yellow/green/gray, police/citizens, democrats/republicans, taxpayers/representatives. I'm sick of seeing this country run like a sporting game where people only agree because they like a certain team."
