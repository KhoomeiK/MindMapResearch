Comments like that in childhood can really have an severe impact. My brother who wasn't even over weight at the time was called fat by a cousin and it lead him to starve and throw up any food he did eat until he was 16. Let's be honest here shaming those children wasn't in the best interest for their health if you actually cared you would have not approached the situation like that. 

Although your aunt is an asshole you are so much more in this situation for bringing the kids into it. Like why do you need to even ask if you are an asshole ??????? A child is starving themselves because if what you said . What is wrong with you?

Learn to stick up for yourself without throwing innocent bystanders under the bus.

AmItheAsshole,fc46q61,t1_fc3m4j5,1577408107.0,I think as long as she is just praying herself  and not forcing others to join in that part is fine as praying before eating is a part of her religion but definitely a conversation about boundaries is needed.

AmItheAsshole,fc1tok4,t3_efo54d,1577329384.0,"YTA: The last sentence just kills me. Everything aside how do you still feel you did nothing ""truly"" wrong after that CHILD broke down and bared her soul to you? Instead of coming to the internet for comfort and reassurance that you didn't actually do the shitty thing you did how about you comfort and reassure your stepdaughter? OF COURSE leaving her out of photos and giving her less gifts would upset her. Also the bullshit excuse that they are young was why they got more is ridiculous."
