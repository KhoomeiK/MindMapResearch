politics,ffiti6u,t1_ffit6sb,1579982328.0,You are the one ignoring the data and inventing the reality you want.  You are pretending the Southern Primaries don't exist and that Biden isn't crushing everyone in the polls of those states.  Hopefully Sanders learned from 2016 and actually campaigns there or he is the one who is going to be in the delegate hole.
politics,ffit0m0,t1_ffisfl0,1579981977.0,">Biden will be underwater in delegates at this rate,

No he won't.  And once the primary moves to the south he will be the one with the advantage.  Bernie has his work cut out for him to make the big gains required in the southern primaries. Both Iowa and New Hampshire have a combined 65 delegates.  SC has 54 and Biden is polling around 30-35% and Sanders is the one struggling to get over the viability mark."

You realize this same poll shows Sanders losing to Trump in Iowa by a larger margin than Biden?  Are we going to ignore that because we don't like it?"
politics,ffirzlh,t1_ffiet2r,1579981237.0,Like Iowa matters?  This very same poll shows Biden losing to trump there by 2 points while Sanders loses to Trump by 6.  But I imagine you will ignore that.
politics,ffirvq1,t1_ffi7cnr,1579981160.0,"Iowa and New Hampshire do not matter once the primary moves onto other states.  The idea that those two states decide anything is outdated.  It used to matter because money for primaries was hard to get so you had to win early to get cash but now fundraising is a lot easier.  

Once the primary moves onto Nevada and SC where Biden polls well what happened in Iowa and New Hampshire won't matter.

>Biden is underwater in delegates by super tuesday it's probably going to bury him.

But he won't be.  Delegates are given out proportionally.  Nobody is going to come out of Iowa and New Hampshire with much of a delegate lead."
