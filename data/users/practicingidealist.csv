Not everyone values people just for their own self-absorbed direct personal benefit.  The right words at the right time can have a  profound impact, no matter the source.  Someone lacking in empathy would have a hard time understanding that."

It's too easy to be judgmental of people who carry a lot of extra weight or mentally make snarky, offhanded comments about them while forgetting that they may be quite thoughtful, introspective people who are probably more frustrated with themselves than anyone else could ever be.  It's good to be reminded that criticism should be tempered with compassion."

They talk about their bodies as an entity separate from themselves.  *That* sounds like actual disembodiment, divorcing body from mind."

It's kind of like IF without the drinks.  People who are truly unable to do it get excused and give donations to feed those in need instead."

That's a one-time decision. Every time you see the box you have to make a decision all over again and resolve weakens each time.  Maybe make others aware of what you're trying to do so they don't bring stuff to your house."
