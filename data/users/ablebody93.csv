Which is why you get the keto crazies yelling that calories don't matter (they do).  They just don't realize they're doing CICO in disguise.  Of course, there are still plenty of people doing keto that overeat and don't lose any weight except for the initial water weight."

I agree.  I'm all about easy running, but will push some long runs, especially portions of them, to simulate some race level discomfort, but not to the point of impacting other quality training runs.  

> You're right that someone that read this though that does strictly go by one of the strict definitiions may be confused into thinking that a long run.

I understood what you were saying, and I train similarly, but someone using the strict definition may get a little confused, especially a novice runner."

Obviously keep up with the PT exercises.  Some people have to get a sleeping boot, which keeps the fascia stretched out over night so it doesn't tighten up due to scar tissue.  I remember PF being the worst in the mornings."

Where? (edit: I see you said that in another thread)

> Actually, there are a ton of different definitions for what a tempo pace and tempo run is

Not really. Tempo pace is tempo/threshold pace.  There are different workouts that incorporate this pace that are considered tempo workouts. You clarified, though, so it's cool."

However, the better trained you are, the more efficient you'll be, so you'll use slightly less energy per mile.  I think the quick and dirty calculation is 0.63xyour weight in pounds.  I'm quite a bit lighter than I was for my last marathon (about 10-15 lbs) and I only burn around 75-85 calories per mile depending on the terrain (I'm just under 130 lbs)."

Not that I need that much nutrition during training, but that is always my race day strategy, so it doesn't hurt to get your body adapted to it.

running,fedt9gj,t1_feckrv6,1579019409.0,"> I'll do tempo long runs, with sections at race pace,

What's your definition of tempo?  My tempo/threshold pace (a touch under 7 min/mile) is quite a bit faster than my marathon goal pace (7:27 min/mile).

Other than that, I think I agree.  My long runs are typically done about a minute slower than my goal race pace.  If I'm feeling good towards the end, I might crank it up to goal pace.  The day before my long runs are typically middle distances (6-10 miles) at goal race pace."
