I'm also using my garden to basically farm and in the gardening career lol I hope to upgrade to maybe small home one day üòä I've actually enjoyed making a new sim and just having fun with different parts of the game that I wouldn't normally mess with."
BravoRealHousewives,ff8opzb,t1_ff7z1fo,1579689283.0,"I actually imagined Tom and Ariana with a bar and not tied to lvp. My opinion has changed of these two drastically tbh, Tom needs to get off his high horse abit. If he wants full control of a business and be the top dog, invest fully in your goddamn own."

Interesting take on kristen with jax, I actually can see it. Even after they shagged they still managed to maintain a close friendship. I can imagine they've used eachother for sex at some point too.

She gets obsessed in easily, even with James it's weird."

BravoRealHousewives,fedmgwx,t1_feclak1,1579015129.0,"Brittany wanted to tame the guy that couldn't commit and wear that badge or honour. Jax married and stayed with Brittany to prove he could change and could be a guy that would settle down, he wears that badge with doubt.

When he cheated with faith and got recorded, all that stuff he said didn't just come from nowhere. As harsh as it was, I think what he thought of her had some truth.

Schwartz is a beaten wife. Not literally but I think she's very controlling and him running away last episode speaks a million words - Season 2 when they go to Stassis mums, and Sandoval tries to kiss Kristen etc. Katie chimes in, he makes a comment to her about 'is this the dark side' something like that and he also makes a comment on them both arguing, so this dynamic has been going on for a long long time.
The poor guy was given an ultimatum in marriage wtf! 

It's clearly not good sex that keeps them together because she's not putting out (last week he suggested to get sexy time back)"
BravoRealHousewives,fedlmmd,t1_feck0jt,1579014562.0,"Urgghh you want to love James so much then you're hit with his douche bag ways. He's a mini jax but I think he's got a harsher tongue and wicked actions - I do hope he can be someone who will redeem and become a better person but I don't think that will change, especially as he clings on to this whole 'I don't work at sur' and now his doll works there.

Lala is getting on my last nerves, especially with all this preachy shit on twitter. She is the last person I will take advice from lol!"

BravoRealHousewives,feciihv,t1_fechh32,1578974743.0,"She was a shitty wife. Played the victim the entire time, didn't really dedicate much to helping him stay clean etc. It's tough being with someone who's got drug and alcohol issues and I'm not saying he was perfect but sometimes she was a mega dick. 
I think she got married because she wanted the fuss tbh.

The only thing that defines her is her music career, you'll find it in the dictionary under 'joke'."

I think since being with him she's so above herself, that I think given his record with owing fofty money I feel its more than likely money issues that would break them up. I can't see her being on pump rules if she is going to marry him and start a family. But, they may stick it through. She does seem happy with him but is that the title of having money? If Katie and Tom are still together then I have hope."

I would make sure the final copy is formatted correctly and you can order a proof to check before hand. 

Kdp is a great way to go if it's just going to be for friends and family, as well as anyone wanting to test the waters for the first time in self publishing.

This way is free and the only thing you pay for is if you order author copies."
