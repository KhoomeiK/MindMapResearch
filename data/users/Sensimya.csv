AmItheAsshole,fflyl5i,t1_ffk2of2,1580045805.0,Omg it's a disagreement. He's not a control freak based off of this one instance. He's just being pig headed and selfishly short sighted. We all do this sometimes. Not every unsavory thing someone does in a relationship is a red flag. Relax.

And these things are on a smaller scale but still true. Thanks for the discussion friend and for not getting nasty about it. Its refreshing. I'm stepping into a meeting tho and won't be able to respond. Have a good day!

I've experienced it in the workplace as well. I've had customers ignore me as a manger and request a male one as, ""I clearly don't know what I'm talking about"". Then my male counterpart who was really an assistant manager would come over and either say the same that I did or look to me for the answer because I was the MANAGER.

AmItheAsshole,fela8p8,t3_epnjxj,1579217471.0,"As someone who practically raised my two younger siblings, sooooooooooo NTA. From age 13 until I moved out I was the go to babysitter, homework helper, I cooked for them, took them to extra curriculars, etc. I love my siblings but I hold alot of resentment that I didn't get the same opportunities as them because I was busy being there for them. 

Your parents already putting that responsibility on you is terrible and not something to take lightly. You have zero responsibility toward your sibling except being a good human and sibling to them. That does not include parental duties. I would've loved if my folks asked me before pawning my siblings off on me and telling me I'm babysitting. I would have loved if they'd asked me because often times I would've said yes. It's the assumption that the older sibling has to be there for the child the same way a parent needs to be is the issue. Your brother will not be your child. He is not your responsibility."

Damnthatsinteresting,fee1pux,t1_fedc3ba,1579024568.0,You should be able to file a claim with your insurance company. My boyfriend has regular meds and every once in a while the insurance company like to dick around and say we don't cover it. So we pay out of pocket that month and have to file a claim in order for them to pull their head out their ass and reimburse us like 3 months later.
