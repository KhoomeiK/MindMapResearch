First, I don't think Lyanna would die if Rhaegar killed Robert and won the Battle of the Trident. Either A.) Gets moved to Starfall and gives birth there with access to Maesters, midwives, and healers or B.) Doesn't pull a Padme and die due to a broken heart. 

Given that it us mentioned that Westrosi marriage requires the going to be married couple both individually consent. She would likely say that she never wanted to marry Robert and was in love with Rhaegar. Or the arrest theory is true and Aerys sent men to arrest her for the Laughing tree incident. 

The fight at the tower of joy would never happen and Ned almost certainly didn't kill arthur in the books. 

Rhaegar will probably be lenient to the rebels after Robert's death. Probably just ask for hostages at the worst. 

Depends on Elia's feelings about the whole situation, though I don't doubt Dorne would be angry. But not enough to rebel or plot. 

Just because of Lyanna's personality, I wouldn't be surprised if Jon was fostered at Winterfell at a certain age. But would likely spend his early childhood in King's landing with Rhaegar and Lyanna."

Your Thunderwolf cavalry should all have storm shields and the pack leader should have the thunder hammer as he has more attacks. They are on expensive side, but they can be pretty hard to kill if you give them storm shields. Basic rule for the Wolves is throw storm shields on everything that can take them.

Keep the Grey Hunters as cheap as possible they don't last long aganist a gun line.  Also I would add another squad or a squad of Blood Claws and take them as a battalion detachment for that extra 5cp.

I would suggest getting Arjac his base 5 strength with his hammer it makes him hit at strength 10 also he reduces damage by 1 with his shield.

Njal in runic terminator armor would be good, same with the Rune priest in phobos armor. Any rune priest that has deep striking ability would be good to be honest.

I would also suggest using the 2x twin heavy bolters, you want to clear out infantry screens, especially as you have a bunch of options that are primed for anti-tank/characters/LoW

Your Thunderwolf cavalry should all have storm shields and the pack leader should have the thunder hammer as he has more attacks. They are on expensive side, but they can be pretty hard to kill if you give them storm shields. Basic rule for the Wolves is throw storm shields on everything that can take them.

Keep the Grey Hunters as cheap as possible they don't last long aganist a gun line.  Also I would add another squad or a squad of Blood Claws and take them as a battalion detachment for that extra 5cp.

I would suggest getting Arjac his base 5 strength with his hammer it makes him hit at strength 10 also he reduces damage by 1 with his shield.

Njal in runic terminator armor would be good, same with the Rune priest in phobos armor. Any rune priest that has deep striking ability would be good to be honest. 

I would say get Ulric too as he would pair very will with the Wulfen and Blood claws especially if you put them all in the Storm Wolf

This would be my suggestion

So of course the climate will warm up, as it had been in a cooling period. 

How the hell is cutting military spending going to affect the climate. It's not like we're throwing nukes around like crazy.

Also you cut the military you have Russian tanks in Pairs and Chinese jets flying over Toyko and Chinese troops crossing the Taiwan strait.

1.) Most law enforcement and professional security only shoot enough to qualify, your average concleaded carry holder will train far more regularly. As not every cop loves guns as much as the person who went out of their way to get a conceal carry permit.

2.) Concleaed carry shooting shooting pretty comparable to law enforcement requires, some states have it exactly the same, others have similar but slightly different for the actual shooting. 

3.)  We have more big cities with a far larger gang and drug problem than most countries. Most murders with firearms are committed by gang members. Prohibition is probably at fault for it, but too late now. 

4.) Restricting access to firearms always leads to tyranny. It would be so perfect if you're from Germany, the UK, or any other country that has gone through period of tyrannical rule and/or committed full blown genocide. 

5.) Concealed carry holders are statistically more law abiding that law enforcement officers and LEOs are already one of the most law abiding populations in the US. 

6.) Police being the main ones armed didn't help that people killed by police in the UPS shootout in Florida."

Fucking bubba can make a full auto sten submachine gun in his backyard shed in a long weekend if he takes his time. 

Meanwhile in order develop those meds you need a team of highly skilled and educated doctors and other scientists using some of the most advanced medical technologies ever devised by Mankind, you need access to various chemical compounds either natural or synthetic, get any trials or experiment reviewed by various regulatory agencies in order to make sure they are ethical and then of course if everything goes well mass produce them and distribute them to the various healthcare providers throughout the world. All of this takes years if not decades.
