I would also suggest using the 2x twin heavy bolters, you want to clear out infantry screens, especially as you have a bunch of options that are primed for anti-tank/characters/LoW

Your Thunderwolf cavalry should all have storm shields and the pack leader should have the thunder hammer as he has more attacks. They are on expensive side, but they can be pretty hard to kill if you give them storm shields. Basic rule for the Wolves is throw storm shields on everything that can take them.

Keep the Grey Hunters as cheap as possible they don't last long aganist a gun line.  Also I would add another squad or a squad of Blood Claws and take them as a battalion detachment for that extra 5cp.

I would suggest getting Arjac his base 5 strength with his hammer it makes him hit at strength 10 also he reduces damage by 1 with his shield.

Njal in runic terminator armor would be good, same with the Rune priest in phobos armor. Any rune priest that has deep striking ability would be good to be honest. 

I would say get Ulric too as he would pair very will with the Wulfen and Blood claws especially if you put them all in the Storm Wolf

1.) Most law enforcement and professional security only shoot enough to qualify, your average concleaded carry holder will train far more regularly. As not every cop loves guns as much as the person who went out of their way to get a conceal carry permit.

2.) Concleaed carry shooting shooting pretty comparable to law enforcement requires, some states have it exactly the same, others have similar but slightly different for the actual shooting. 

3.)  We have more big cities with a far larger gang and drug problem than most countries. Most murders with firearms are committed by gang members. Prohibition is probably at fault for it, but too late now. 

4.) Restricting access to firearms always leads to tyranny. It would be so perfect if you're from Germany, the UK, or any other country that has gone through period of tyrannical rule and/or committed full blown genocide. 

5.) Concealed carry holders are statistically more law abiding that law enforcement officers and LEOs are already one of the most law abiding populations in the US. 

6.) Police being the main ones armed didn't help that people killed by police in the UPS shootout in Florida."

Whatcouldgowrong,fewzjxj,t1_fevnsy5,1579421904.0,"Guns require a lots resources to make dumbass. All you need is some aluminum or steel and wood, polymer, or some kind of metal  plus some matching and you got a gun. Probably not the best gun, but a gun. Fucking bubba can make a full auto sten submachine gun in his backyard shed in a long weekend if he takes his time. 

Meanwhile in order develop those meds you need a team of highly skilled and educated doctors and other scientists using some of the most advanced medical technologies ever devised by Mankind, you need access to various chemical compounds either natural or synthetic, get any trials or experiment reviewed by various regulatory agencies in order to make sure they are ethical and then of course if everything goes well mass produce them and distribute them to the various healthcare providers throughout the world. All of this takes years if not decades. 

Of course a gun is cheaper, they are frankly fairly simple products compared to a medicine that can stabilize a violently mentally ill person."

Seriously, I shouldn't have to spell it out to you."

Fucking gun grabber logic right there."

I wonder why their is a discrepancy."
Grimdank,femeh4l,t1_fehnb2r,1579251288.0,Funny enough half of the people I know in my personal life who like 40K are pretty buff and athletic. Granted one just reads the novels and plays the video games and the other hasn't played since like 6th edition.
