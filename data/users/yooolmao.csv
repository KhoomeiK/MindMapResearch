Except that you can because the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as stated in the article, literally and explicitly stated that is illegal:

> The law even made it a crime for an American company to unknowingly benefit from a partner’s corruption if it could have discovered illicit activity but avoided doing so. This closed what was known as the “head in the sand” loophole.

It goes further when it was recently strengthened and it is so strict that you have to hire a lawyer or investigation team to **make sure your business partner is not doing corrupt shit on a monthly basis.** I don't think they could have said ""if corruption happens on your watch, you're going to fucking prison"" any clearer, do you? 

This law was literally written with the intent of illegalizing scenarios just. like. this. one. Because it is a common way (again, as the article states very clearly, maybe you should read it, because the entirety of the article is written explicitly arguing why and how your assertion is wrong) to accept bribes and launder money with corrupt foreign politicians, oligarchs, and businessmen."

>They aren't really that rare anymore.  Salukis are very popular in the UK and in continental Europe I've seen them fairly regularly.  Due to the way dog culture is in the US, you're not going to see them out and about very much.

Really? I had no idea. I've never seen one here in the US and I've lived in 3 different states and used to work at a dog groomer in high school."
dogs,fdcphyr,t1_fdchr40,1578280773.0,Wow that is awesome! I need to get (my dog) a job like that! I would love to take my boy traveling. They are great travel companions. They really love to explore and I see mine studying nature all the time. He'll just sit there in the wilderness (literally sits) and watches the trees and the wind. I bet your uncle's was a very very goodboi!
dogs,fdcp64i,t1_fdcku80,1578280528.0,"Oh yes! To get my dog exercise when we can't get to the dog park, I take him running. Well he runs - I bicycle alongside him, and he *outruns me* on the bicycle when he wants to. I have to peddle as fast as I can for half the run when he gets excited, and he can easily go for 3 miles straight at probably 15 mph and he doesn't even break a trot. It looks completely effortless to him. If you can run for longer than 3 miles, a slower pace would still probably be a decent workout for him/her.

If you're looking for a running dog, salukis or sloughis are both ideal candidates (they are very similar, both in the greyhound family, the former is called a ""Persian Greyhound"" and the latter an ""Arabian Greyhound"", and both can be found in roughly the same part of the world in the wild (literally the wild, many of them are feral in packs in the desert from being abandoned)).

If you want to adopt one, I highly recommend Desert Hound Express. Many rescue organizations go through them to bring their dogs to North America or Europe. I got mine through Big Fluffy Dogs who worked with DHE to get mine to the States. You can get a very goodboi for rescue dog prices, if you don't mind the chance of a mixed breed.

The best part is they have very long lifetimes because of their build and habit of exercising often. They easily live 12-16 years old, sometimes longer.

EDIT: I missed the part of being well-mannered. They are extremely well-mannered. Safe to leave around kids and everything. My saluki mix has never once gone to the bathroom in the house since I got him, and I got him as a puppy! They are very aloof, and a little stubborn because they are so intelligent, but they show you love in their own, stubborn, aloof, very unique-character ways. They have colorful personalities."

COMPLETEANARCHY,fdchozx,t1_fdcd4wc,1578275161.0,"I agree completely. If they really cared about being the ""leaders of the free world"" and ""world police"" they would give more to the UN and WHO and give more state funding to NGOs like the Red Cross. God knows they give enough money to ""allies"" like Israel ($3 fucking billion *per year*) who turn around and bomb the Palestinians and actually give their citizens free universal healthcare and college tuition but we can't be bothered to do that for our own fucking citizens or even veterans and their families, like you said."

bigseo,fdccsgk,t1_fdac8s2,1578271772.0,"If you're in link building or PR long enough, much of what you charge is for use of relationships forged over your career. Learning who to pay at certain sites like Forbes for links, learning which authority sites and niche blogs will accept money for links under the table, blogs and sites who legitimately need the content enough that they will trade for links, or reporters that will trade authoritative quotes in exchange for a citation or source link (think HARO).

There are plenty of good content marketing agencies who absolutely know how to make good original content and who to share it with for links, but there are always shortcuts if you know who to talk to or pay off."
bigseo,fdcce5p,t1_fdanqo8,1578271519.0,"This. When in doubt, assume they paid. Authority sites, niche magazines and news blogs need money now more than ever, and they will play as dirty as they need to too, in order to survive. A lot of them just started figuring this out. Yes, some do it a little more ethically by using their position as authorities to do sponsored posts on Facebook promoting a paying client's product, but they will absolutely whore themselves out as paid link placement too, advertising disclosure laws be damned."
