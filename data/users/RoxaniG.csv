Teachers,fdrgtn9,t3_emqwiq,1578684337.0,"Several posters mentioned that peer teaching helps the higher level student too and this is true. However, what this student never gets is the experience of being challenged and this is essential to develop grit, learn to face difficulties, etc. Unchallenged students tend to develop unhealthy perfectionism. So it's not only whether the higher level students develop in knowledge as much as they deserve, but also that they lack an academic peer group that is an issue."
Gifted,fdnvqpj,t3_elw7ev,1578593824.0,"Interesting. I can't really answer your question. But my 4.5 daughter (not tested, at least advanced) wants to talk about how ""when she will die, we (her parents) will be dead too"". That ""she will die but in a long, long time"". I was surprised by how realistic and matter-of-fact about this she was."
education,fdnv48x,t1_fdmxuzz,1578593460.0,Good point.
education,fdl606c,t1_fdkyjah,1578517632.0,"Thanks, yeah, I'm all in favor of increasing teacher salaries and I don't see this or many other ideas as related to testing. 

What I was trying to say is: is he proposing to abolish all testing? without replacing it with some other form of evaluation? or reduce the stakes? How? He says ""high-stakes testing is bad"" - sure, what is his proposal to improve it?"
education,fdknjee,t1_fdkg783,1578507269.0,"You object on how the tests are used to evaluate teachers and I don't disagree with you. However the answer to these concerns is to change how the tests are used to evaluate teachers. It's not ""abolish all and any evaluation without proposing any alternatives"". I admittedly skipped the article, but I didn't see what exactly it is that Bernie proposes."
education,fdkcj8u,t3_elt6ut,1578500991.0,"I agree with many things here. However, I don't think that tests per se are evil. ""Teaching to the test is bad"" does not necessarily equates to ""scrap the test"". I don't see why testing is fundamentally contradictory to the later part of this piece. Why do you need to remove testing to increase teacher salaries? Or improve funding of title I schools?

Some kind of evaluation of student progress and achievement is important. What are the better alternatives?"
donorconceived,fb85pay,t3_ebvsrm,1576606720.0,"I'm a parent of a donor-conceived, still young, child, so for what it's worth: I think kids take cues from the parents. If you feel OK about this process, are in peace with it, etc, etc, it will really help them to feel that way too. I suspect this is a big aspect of the issues when kids have been lied to. It's not only the deception itself, it's that it suggests that the parents consider it as something to be kept hidden."
