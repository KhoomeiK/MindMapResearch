Dogfree,fgkq2fd,t1_fgk4bi5,1580871104.0,"There was this video going around a year ago about a realtor who entered a resident’s house and the cat was hissing and pawing at her. Everyone in the comments basically said “fuck cats, I would kick that little shit.” It made my blood boil. Obviously the cat is standing up for his owner/territory and he’s scared of a stranger in his house. He doesn’t know what a realtor is. He’s doing his job and yet so many cruel cat abuse comments. Fuck dog people."
