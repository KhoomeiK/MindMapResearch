heraldry,feznuy7,t3_eqwe6u,1579459466.0,"The [Worshipful Company of Information Technologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Information_Technologists) is one of the City of London's Livery Companies (guilds). It was formed in 1992 and was the 100th Livery Company to be formed.

The City of London (being an independent entity from London) has a long and complex history. The City of London was likely founded because it was close to a bend in the Thames which made ships slow down to go round it, so the waterway could be more easily controlled by whoever held the city. 

The Romans established Londinium as one of their settlements when they invaded Britain, and when they left the settlement was left with a good set of walls and control of the Thames, which made it a powerful commercial city to hold. 

When William the Bastard invaded Britain in 1066 he ran up against the City walls. He didn't want to spend time on besieging the city, and the occupants didn't want to be besieged, so they came to a deal saying that if William agreed to recognise the ancient powers and customs of the city and effectively left them alone and didn't kill them all, they'd accept him as their King.

Ever since then, the City of London has had a special status in the UK. It has it's own customs for electing it's Lord Mayor (not the Mayor of London like Boris Johnson or Ken Livingstone), it's own court of Aldermen, it's own Livery Companies, it's own police, it's own electoral system which involves companies voting, and the Monarch is required to ask permission of the Lord Mayor to enter (ceremonially of course, this is always granted).

London (or Greater London if you prefer that term) grew out of Westminster which was founded as a seat of Government to compete with the City of London. London expanded to encircle the City of London, but they are separate entities to this day. 

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrObZ_HZZUc) explains more.

Livery Companies in the City of London continue to exist, and they still hold roles of great use and importance to society in the City of London, Greater London, and the wider UK. For example the Worshipful Company of Hackney Carriage Drivers is responsible for regulating and licensing black cab drivers in London, the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths is required to test the purity and accuracy of coins minted in the UK for the UK and other countries abroad, and the Worshipful Company of Gunsmiths proofs gun barrels."

[Example photo](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/radiator-on-white-wall-at-home-picture-id758588375?s=612x612)

Radiators can be bigger or smaller than the example above, again depending on how much air there is in the room to heat. Bathrooms tend to have radiators which are more like towel drying frames, so you can dry your bath towel, bath mats etc on them. [Example](https://www.ukbathrooms.com/images/sq/640/7349.jpg). 

Radiators tend to be hung under windows so they provide a heat source near the source of a lot of the cold (as windows are less thermally resistant than walls) or are otherwise on a convenient wall. The radiator pipes run inside the wall for the most part, along with other services like electricity. 

The efficiency comes from the fact that water is easier to heat than air in a boiler, and it transfers heat more efficiently through the pipes and retains it longer so it can be transferred longer distances to the radiators. These are then built to efficiently transfer the heat to the metal radiator and from there to the air by being shaped with ridges and curves so the maximum amount of metal for a given size is exposed to water on the inside and air on the outside for heat transfer."

Central Air is an apt term I've found"
mildlyinfuriating,fesgwt2,t1_fes569a,1579364989.0,"> How tf do they work? 

Most modern systems in the UK work using a [gas boiler](http://www.plumber-dublin.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Greenstar-Gas-Range-Malmesbury-Pic.jpg) which is also used to provide hot water for taps (faucets) etc. The radiators are on a sealed circuit of pipes filled with water - the gas boiler heats the water in a small tank in itself, then a pump in the boiler moves the water around the sealed circuit, heating all the water in the radiators and pipes. 

The [radiators](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-V4vJGpOWIlU/TrEhJYNDkRI/AAAAAAAAAPM/K1fZc80oQmQ/s1600/hiwtc.jpg) are basically big thin-walled slim water tanks (either one tank or two back to back) which get hot water pumped into them by the boiler. Because the metal is a good conductor of heat and the water is hotter than the room the heat dissipates from the radiator into the room. The air moves up (as heat rises) and colder air circulates through the radiator, in turn getting heated. 

Most radiators have a valve on them to control flow through that particular radiator (the radiators tap off of a continuous circuit of pipe so closing the valve on one radiator does not affect the others) so you can control the temperature it puts out.

For countries like the UK that only require heating most of the time this is a much more efficient system than central air as it doesn't require ductwork (which our houses tend not to have room for), our boilers can be combined units for hot tap water and central heating, and water is a more efficient transfer medium for heat than air."

Interestingly from 1860 the British Army required soldiers to have moustaches (if they could grow one) right up until mid 1916 when they decided it was easier for soldiers in the trenches just to be totally clean shaven. 

The requirement to have a moustache was because the British Army felt that in some of the areas they were serving (mainly the middle east) the locals would discredit people with shaved faces as unmanly and weak. It was dropped in 1916 because the new Chief of the British Army didn't like wearing a moustache, so he removed the regulation. It hadn't been enforced that strictly anyway."

He has one ""good conduct stripe"" on his right sleeve, indicating he has done at least 2 years of service without a disciplinary event (these gave an increase in pay but could be removed with loss of the extra pay so don't indicate length of service).

I can't see any rank stripes so I expect he's a private.

The [cap badge](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b0/67/1e/b0671e7a512bdb56f39f7bfad2cd2225.jpg), and your mentioning that he's from Essex makes me think he's likely a member of the [44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/44th_(East_Essex\)_Regiment_of_Foot)

The problem I have is that the dates of uniform he's wearing don't tie up with the ages given in the description, which leads me to believe he's had the photo taken in his mid 60s and he's likely borrowed a more current uniform of his regiment to fit his service so he can be photographed. 

Based on his age I suspect he either served in one of two fields - the 1st battalion of the 44th were sent to North America in 1814 for the war of 1812. The 2nd battalion meanwhile had been in Portugal since 1810 fighting the Napoleonic wars, where they captured a French Imperial eagle (the French equivalent of a Colour) at the battle of Salamanca in 1812. The 2nd battalion came back to the UK in June 1813 and then landed in The Netherlands where they fought at the battle of Quatre Bras and the battle of Waterloo in 1815. 

If he continued service with the regiment he would have gone to India in 1822 and they fought in the first Anglo-Burmese war in 1825. They returned to India in 1826.

By dint of him being alive to be photographed I can presume he had left the Regiment before 1842 because they were involved in the disastrous retreat from Kabul that saw all of the column that they were in killed or captured, save one surgeon and a handful of civilians."

This suggests that they didn't land at Heathrow, as they could just be given a landing slot like any other plane - this is how Royal flights normally happen for larger planes.

Secondly, the article merely mentions that the Royal flight is based out of Northolt, which is true. It didn't say that any Royals were on board, and when the planes aren't booked by the Royals the Royal flight does navigation training, flying other military and government VIPs around and various other duties.

My guess is that they were doing some sort of training around Windsor castle, probably with the Royal Flight's helicopter, and they intruded into civilian airspace for some reason - Heathrow is very close to Windsor which is right under the extended centrelines of both runways."

The train in this event was put into service in the 1970s (and they are still running now on the Bakerloo and Piccaddilly lines) - the more modern trains have sorted this issue out by adding an extra safety device.

The more modern trains have a power handle which is spring loaded in two directions - the driver must twist it horizontally through 90 degrees to indicate that they are there and are in control (hanging a bag on this will not work) and this has the same function as the older trains as described above.

The second spring loading is forwards/backwards. The driver must hold the handle forwards to apply power, rather than putting the handle into a position and leaving it there. Letting go of the handle returns it to the ""full brake application"" position.

The driving lever in [this photo](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8297/7879022886_c252dc5bf0_b.jpg) is the big red handle built into the right arm rest of the chair. By comparison, [this is the 1973 stock cab](http://www.trainweb.org/tubeprune/73%20TS%20refurb%20cab%20desk.jpg), of the same type as reported in the incident. The power handle is on the left of the desk in the centre of the photo. Holding it down deactivates the dead man's device. 

That takes care of the manual bit - for the automatic bit once the driver presses a ""go"" button the automatic signalling then drives the train until it reaches the next stopping point in the next station - the automatic signalling takes care of everything (including waiting at signals if required) so if the driver is taken ill (or leaves the cab) the train will make it to the next station by itself unless the emergency stop button in the cab is pressed."
ProgrammerHumor,fel90i2,t1_fekv60r,1579216685.0,"Mostly on the Jubilee Line Extension, since it was one of the most recent developments.

It's been harder to fit them elsewhere, because of the lack of compatibility with trains, curved platforms, and the fact that fitting them removes the ventilation from a lot of stations, as the trains push masses of air around the system which keeps the air in the stations and tunnels moving. Trains suck in fresh air from the entrances/exits to the tunnels and keep it moving round the system. 

If barriers were fitted everywhere then the stations would have to have extra air movement systems fitted otherwise the air would get hotter and more stale very quickly."
ProgrammerHumor,fel8sau,t1_fekczsz,1579216537.0,"The Great Western Railway in the UK has had something like this since 1908 - this ""Automatic Train Control"" system is what all of the later ones were based on.

The original ATC system had a rail between the running rails at a signal - if the signal was clear the extra rail was energised (electrified). When a train passed over it, a shoe on the bottom of the train would pick up the electricity and would sound a horn in the cab. Thus the driver knew the signal was clear

If the extra rail was not energised (either because the signal was at stop or something was broken) then the train would not detect the electricity, but the height of the rail would push the shoe up. This made a bell sound in the cab, and if the driver didn't press an acknowledgement button within a few seconds the train's emergency brake would apply, stopping the train."
ProgrammerHumor,fel8dfu,t1_fel25po,1579216273.0,"Nope, this happened on the Picc in 1993 - it was a 73 stock train, and the driver got out of the train to check a stuck/obstructed door with the driving handle in a motoring position and his bag hung on it, so the deadman's handle was engaged even though he wasn't touching it.

So it's essentially the same as him putting a brick on the accelerator of a car then pulling away a lever holding the clutch down from outside the car, and then being surprised when the car takes off"

Driver's doors on these trains are separate, and on the 73 stock they are commonly wedged open by drivers in the summer to provide additional ventilation as the trains can get very hot inside."
ProgrammerHumor,fel7cj4,t1_fekngss,1579215629.0,"On the named lines above once the driver presses the ""go"" button (after the doors are closed and all other safety checks complete) the automatic signalling takes over and motors and brakes the train as appropriate until the next stopping point at the next station is reached. 

There is no need for the driver to hold down the dead man's handle if the train is being automatically driven as the driver is not making any manual inputs to the train at all. 

If something were to happen to the driver this would be spotted when the train fails to leave the next station - the train will not start until the go button is pressed and the doors are closed, so either the train stops at the station and the driver doesn't open the doors, causing alarm, or they don't close the doors, causing alarm, or the train doesn't move off, causing alarm.

If they are well enough to keep cycling the doors and pressing the go button then the automatic train control will continue working to safely move the train - a situation like Moorgate where the driver fails to react to reaching a station etc can't happen as the automatic signalling will halt the train itself."
ProgrammerHumor,fel6w2s,t1_fek8eha,1579215345.0,"This wasn't ""driving"" itself. It was a 73 stock train where the driver put the power handle in a motoring position, and hung a bag from the dead man's handle. He then got out to look at a faulty door with the power handle left in drive, completed the door interlock circuit when he closed the faulty door, the pilot light lit, and the train motored off. 

It was tripped by a train stop at the next red signal but other than that it was just powering along out of control."
ProgrammerHumor,fel6imn,t1_fekhjig,1579215113.0,"On older tube trains the drivers used to leave the cab doors open for ventilation as it gets pretty hot down there. 

On the trains that had inwards-opening doors (like house doors) it was easy, just wedge the door open. 

On sliding doors (which used air pressure to keep them shut) they'd wedge the emergency tunnel telephone handset box or another similar object in the door to keep it open.

Drivers doors on these trains were not part of the safety system to make sure all passenger doors were shut before letting the trains move. Therefore this didn't break the safety systems on the train, and the London Underground management tolerated it as the drivers were the only ones at risk, and they were fairly sensible about it, generally only opening the doors on the opposite side of the train to them. 

On newer trains the drivers doors have to be shut too, but they also tend to have aircon for the driver's cab so the need for the doors to be open isn't there."
ProgrammerHumor,fel62r4,t1_fekl0b1,1579214841.0,"The older trains had folding seats so the drivers could choose to sit or stand. They are supposed to hold down the power handle (throttle) so that the safety systems know the driver is there. If the driver lets go, the handle springs up, and if the handle stays up for more than a few seconds all drive power is removed from the train and the emergency brake is applied. 

In this case the driver hung his bag on the handle, weighting it down. He also left the handle in a position which would have applied power to the train motors, had the door interlock system which checks all the doors are closed not indicated that a door was open. 

When the driver went to check on the door, he closed it, completing the ""doors closed"" circut, and applying power to the train motors. The train then took off and was only stopped by another safety device which applied the emergency brake when the train overran a red signal."
ProgrammerHumor,fel5io7,t1_fekpnzj,1579214503.0,"After the [1975 Moorgate tube disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorgate_tube_crash) a lot of tube lines were fitted with a system of ""train stops"" - these are little levers which sit next to each signal. The lever is raised when a signal is red and it lowers when the signal turns green or yellow (safe to proceed). If the lever is raised and the train passes over it, the lever knocks a valve on the underside of the train which opens the train brake pipe to atmosphere. 

Because pressurised air is used to keep the brakes on the train off (that way if the system is empty the brakes stay on - this is called a failsafe system), venting the pressurised air to atmosphere applies the brakes. A safety system on the train automatically disengages power to the driving motors if this happens.
