What makes the generation (which again doesn't apply to everybody in it) suck is the politics they voted for. Trickle down economics of the Reagan era failed, and most people today are feeling the effects of it while the boomers (as a demographic) are sitting happy and preventing us from changing anything. And then insulting us for wanting to. 

And the biggest reason that's frustrating is that they were overwhelmingly left in their youth. When the boomers were young, they were all hippies and free love and anti-authoritarian, and as soon as they got jobs and money and they didn't need that stuff for themselves, they locked down on that stuff as hard as possible.

The president of the United States said that the majority of Mexican immigrants are rapists and murderers. This is demonstrably false, yet he has the full backing of the Senate and the Supreme Court. Black people are more likely to be charged, more likely to be arrested, more likely to be convicted, and on average given longer sentences than white people who committed the exact same crime, even accounting for prior criminal history and economic status. Check out this quote from Nixon's campaign manager: 

>The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.

The war on drugs was created specifically to arrest black people. It is still in full effect today. 

The word racist has been made into a naughty word, elevated by racists into such a high position of power that people forget what it actually means. By convincing the public that racism only means burning black people in effigy and tattooing swastikas, they've allowed people to feel comfortable with institutional racism like the war on drugs, like attempting to ban middle easterners from entering the country, and like believing that the West is an entire ""us"" and that Latin America and the middle East are the ""other"" who are incompatible with our way of life. It just doesn't hold any water, because our ways of life are not any more different than those of other western cultures.

You're right, people will be affected. They may, especially on the wealthier (but not necessarily extremely rich) side of things, lose some amount of money. What I'm doubting is your assumption that most people will lose, and the implication that anyone might lose so much that they can no longer retire comfortably."

The three most basic ways to mitigate panic are to take deep breaths, listen to calming music, and try to keep busy doing something else. They don't always work, and maybe they don't even usually work, so don't feel bad at all if none of those things help. It's just worth a shot.

But now instead of having nearly life and death power over you if you don't pay up, they're an employee who you can fire. They'd actually exist in a free market where they have to be competitive and provide quality services, and if you wanted to take on the upkeep of your home by yourself then you now have that option (so an even more free market with even more valid competition). 

I've lived in three apartments in the past three years, and only one of those three even actually did the job you're saying I'm paying them for. The other two just took my money and took my complaints and never sent anybody to actually fix them. But I was fundamentally incapable of firing them and hiring somebody else, like you'd be able to do in a competitive free market like this country prides itself so much on, because their real profit was from owning the building without actually adding anything to the economy or performing any services."
