houseplants,ff6fja0,t3_ervh2h,1579626092.0,"I am just jealous your cat doesn't eat your plants, having a scratcher that close to that plant on the ground. My jerk cats would decimate it. I had a ponytail palm on my windowsill and a haworthia and my cats bit the tips off each leaf of my haworthia and chewed off a ton of pieces of my ponytail palm. They also pulled it off the window sill and cracked the terra cotta pot. They have chewed a piece off my my aglaonema before I put it up higher. They are jerks... I tried putting a bromeliad on my kitchen table thinking it got perfect light and looked so pretty! Nope my jerk cats climbed on the table and completely destroyed its beautiful leaves. So now everything has to be crammed together on shelves so they can't jump up on the shelves, and nothing can be on the floor. The only plant they can reach is my alocasia regal shield. They leave the leaves completely alone but try to dig in the soil so I top dressed it with rocks. Sometimes I hate cats... they are lucky I love them. Jerks.

I am in Zone 9B, do you think this would be happier outside? It might be too cold outside this time of year for it unless it can withstand colder temps than an alocasia.

As far as the regal shield goes, mine was already this big when I got it. However I did have to chop off one of the droopy leaves. It had only 1 big leaf and 1 smaller one so the other leaves are new growth. They had it potted in a really heavy poor draining mix infested with fungus gnats. I had it for a few months and every time I stuck my moisture meter in the soil it came back as wet which means it was not drying out. So I stuck it next to my south facing window so it gets a ton of bright indirect light. I have never watered it lol. I've had it maybe 2 nearly 3 months. It was just in that super dense wet soil so it hasn't needed water. I never mist any plant, I have a mixed feeling on misting. I just let my plants dry out completely and then give them a deep drink. For my alocasias I don't let them dry out completely, instead I use a moisture meter and let them get to the point where it is right before dry. Like a 3 on my meter if that makes sense? So its not bone dry but its nearly there. I then give it a good soak and I also keep my alocasia amazonica/polly on a pebble tray. I haven't done a pebble tray for the regal shield or the new one. The regal shield seems fine without the extra humidity. I think my house stays about 50% humidity regularly anyway. I don't bottom water any plant, I know its good for some plants but I never found it necessary for any of mine. Most of my plants are low water plants (monstera, pothos, philodendrons, zz, sansevaria, aglaonema, string of hearts, hoya, lipstick plant, and a syngonium) so I never thought it was worth bottom watering since I find it faster and less effort to top water them. I just make sure they all have fast draining airy soil. I use the same mix of coco coir, orchid bark, perlite, and worm castings for all my plants besides my sansevaria and ZZ which I used cactus mix with extra perlite. 

My biggest issue has been with my alocasia amazonica loves to get crispy leaves that turn yellow then brown and die off. I think the winter isn't providing enough light for it. The regal shield is fine though, no crispy leaves, no yellowing. So maybe its tougher or holds more water in its stems so doesn't require as much water or humidity. Not sure but the amazonica atleast flowered for me. Lol"

I don't know why my ""advanced"" human brain can't get over its primal fear of flying insects. Seriously, even moths flying towards my face illicits the saddest fear shriek you have ever heard. I love insects and bugs so much and yet I am absolutely terrified of them. Its this weird respect/fear conundrum.

succulents,fepq213,t1_fepiqfj,1579327490.0,"Well mine is in a pretty bright spot but doesn't get direct sun, I am in Zone 9B so we get pretty mild winters so mine is kept outside. I basically ignore it, it has been rained on so I don't water it. I let them dry out completely and it really thrives on my neglect. I can't actually remember when I watered any of my outside plants last. The zwartkop goes dormant in the summer when it gets really hot and their active growing season is during the fall/winter. They lose leaves as they go dormant. I use a moisture meter to know when the soil is completely dried out if I am unsure by just sticking my finger in the soil. Usually during the summer time during their dormancy I water way less. I don't repot them or try to propagate them. I just water them just enough that they don't dry out completely but again it gets to be like 110 degrees in the summer here lol.

My succulents if they are inside get put into the south facing windowsill but I find they do much better outside because of my climate. They need a ton of bright indirect light. 

Also you cannot leaf propagate an aeonium, just stem cuttings. And they die after flowering. They are usually killed by overwatering. Like they rot stupid easy. I killed one because of overwatering before I learned not to water as often during their dormancy. If my aeonium was inside I would probably not water them at all during the dormancy period. 

Also I fertilize them during the growing season if I remember to. I forgot this year... I can still do it, I am sure they would appreciate the feeding.

As long as its not losing all its leaves you're probably good, they just sometimes look super scraggly and sad when they lose their old growth.

When we first moved into this house back in October of last year the neighborhood cats had turned this window box into a giant litterbox. Which I learned the hard way when I opened the window to air out my house. Pleasant way to discover tons of cat poop right next to your window.

So I dug it out and decided the best way to fight the outdoor cats was to put rocks and sharp pointy plants they wouldn't be interested in eating or pooping near again. My plan worked! And now I have a beautiful window box and my cats can snooze in the window without outdoor cats messing with them.

dogs,fehs5az,t3_ep5jpm,1579122795.0,"I posted something very similar to this back in October of 2019. We had a 15 year old lab mix from the time he was 2 months old. He was diagnosed with hip dysplasia at 11 or 12. Then later at 14 he was starting to lose muscle tone in his back end and was very skeletal. He started having poop accidents constantly and we took him to the vet for fecal incontinence and he was diagnosed with degenerative myelopathy. He started having issues stumbling and his back legs dragged sometimes. He also had severe skin issues we had been fighting for years. Different diagnosis, different treatments and nothing worked. We had tried apoquel, cytopoint injections multiple times, and atopica. The atopica worked at first but he went right back to licking and chewing his paws until they were red and sore. We dealt with skin infections, coning him. It was rough. No food changes or environmental changes worked, no medications worked. He also went deaf which made him jumpy, anxious, and he became nippy. Which never in a million years did I think he was the type of dog to try to nip! He started to shy away from affection and get fearful, even though he has never been abused and we have been his owners since he was 2 months old. He started not wanting us to pet him as much. Started barking as soon as we put him outside, he would go potty and immediately bark incessantly until we brought him inside. Luckily I stay home with my kids so I was always there to take care of him, but it was very draining mentally. I loved him so much though so I didn't realize how much his care took its toll until he was gone. He started getting restless at night, and we had to start crating him at night due to his accidents so he would circle in his crate and just seemed like he couldn't get comfortable. He also had tremors at night where his body would shake and his legs would twitch.

I made an appointment to have a quality of life assessment done by his vet. The day before his appointment I ran to Costco and was there with my kids for about 2 hours. I came home to find Coal laying in a pile of his own poop. His poop though was sand. Literally he had eaten a ton of sand out in the dog run (it has sand under pea gravel) and he pooped it out. When I cleaned it up it was SO much sand. I mean maybe 2 or 3 cups of it. It was really bad. His accidents had been increasing. We had just moved into our new house the beginning of October and in the month we had lived here he declined so fast. 

The next day was his appointment and he had such a good day, he went outside to potty, no accidents, he slept and wanted attention, he ate his breakfast and it was like a normal day. Which made it so much harder later that day when the vet told us based on everything going on with him he felt it was time to let him go. The vet even said he might have put him down sooner when the incontinence started. He lived a year after he was starting the incontinence and I don't regret not putting him down sooner because he was still acting pretty normal otherwise. 

So we made the decision to put him down, his death was quiet, he was given a shot to make him go to sleep first which happened so fast. Then they gave him the euthanasia drug and he was gone in seconds. Didn't make a peep just stopped breathing. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make and I still miss him so much.

I went over that decision over and over. I made the appointment on a monday and it happened on a Wednesday. Then that weekend I realized he was euthanized 15 years to the day that we adopted him. We signed his adopted papers October 30th 2004 and he died October 30th 2019. A day before Halloween. We adopted him at a Halloween event at a local school. He was the best dog I've ever met or had the privilege to own. I had him basically half my life (I am 31). Its crazy that he isn't here anymore, my kids have grown up with him (they are 3 and 6) and my 6 year old cried so hard. That was the second hardest part, telling my daughter we had to put him down.

Anyway sorry for rambling! I do think you are making the right decision putting her down. Coal still ate, still drank, still could get up and walk outside, some dogs never lose their appetite up till they pass away. It happens and each dog is different. Euthanasia is a gift, a peaceful and painless death. They just slip quietly away and die with dignity. I feel like its the final kindness we can do for a pet we love so much."
dogs,fefq1wg,t3_eomrod,1579061976.0,"After my 15 year old lab mix had to be put down I debated about getting a brand new puppy. My kids are 3 and 6 and the 3 year old isn't potty trained yet. I have 2 older dogs, a 12 year old blind pug and a boxer mix who just turned 10. He is super mellow and both dogs basically sleep all day. They enjoy walks but very short slow strolls, not jogs anymore. We have 2 cats as well. The idea of bringing in an untrained, un potty trained fresh puppy sounds like a nightmare to me. And I stay home with the kids but I am busy all the time and my husband works all day. So we adopted a lab mix from the shelter. She is some kind of scruffy medium sized black lab mix, she has wirey hair so not sure what she is mixed with. She is likely 1 or 2 years old. She came to us good with cats, good with other dogs, fully potty trained, and had some basic obedience. Which makes me feel bad she ended up in the shelter. She wasn't spayed, but she was well trained, well socialized, and well mannered. Someone clearly put in the work with her, which makes it more sad she ended up in the shelter.

We are very glad to have her and not having to do so much work with a brand new puppy. I hate potty training with a passion. Our new dog just needs some leash work but otherwise she is a great dog. I respect people that get puppies and do all the work to make them great dogs.

We raised our 15 year old dog from 2 months old and we had an amazing bond and he was pretty much the perfect dog. Albeit a bit of a jerk sometimes but an amazing dog lol. So it was hard getting a dog someone else raised at first, but it was worth it. She is amazing with kids, she adores both girls so it made it worth it adopting her."
whatsthisplant,febzmcp,t1_febnoxi,1578964625.0,That is a nice rule. I honestly TRY to Google things myself before posting things. Especially for things like posting to plant clinic because I feel like the stuff going on with my plants is common. However sometimes I will spend hours googling different things scouring for information and find nothing! So its nice to have people to ask when I have tried hard and am tired of reading the same plant care tips that are not helping my situation.

cactus,fe0dm28,t1_fe015i1,1578810967.0,"I feel this way about all my cacti, like my fuzzy old man cactus... I know its just soft looking and under that soft fuzzy exterior are spines waiting to jab me. Its just so fuzzy!! Damn adorable cacti."
succulents,fe0cedv,t1_fe041i4,1578809655.0,Well to be fair I apparently neglected my plants too much thinking I was overwatering. I tried to back off so much I went to the other end of the spectrum and underwatered my begonias to the point where one may not come back. Sometimes I just suck at things lol.
ancestors,fe0bi3e,t1_fdzzn3m,1578808733.0,Although every time I get jumped by 4 hyenas I really wished I had a gun. That will show those cackling bastards.
ancestors,fdzxicq,t3_en7lc7,1578798205.0,"I restarted twice because I didn't understand so many things in the game. I didn't watch any videos, read any guides. Just went in blind. I didn't realize there was a little ""ding"" to tell you when things were done. Like the grooming, crafting, ect. I also didn't realize that there was a ""ding"" for attacking or dodging. The game either doesn't tell you or I didn't read it. I wasn't having fun being murdered constantly. Also didn't know there was a murder cat that randomly spawns in if you stay on the ground too much. What changed it for me was watching one of those videos on YouTube called ""10 things I wished I knew before starting ancestors"" it really helped me get the basics down but didn't reveal enough to spoil the game. I think its a good idea to read some basic guides or watch some videos before you start that way you aren't being frustrated to the point where the game isn't fun anymore."
