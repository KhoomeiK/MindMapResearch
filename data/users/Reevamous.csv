YouShouldKnow,fgnc0eu,t3_ezb05a,1580941683.0,This is not entirely true. At my work they take into account the subject matter of the complaint and keep track of quantity of complaints of each subject. They use this to figure out what area needs the most attention/corrections. So an example would be if hold times complaints are noticed/rising around a certain time frame they would put more coverage on the phones during that time.
