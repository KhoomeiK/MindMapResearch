poshmark,fh98wvr,t3_f1ylcu,1581375752.0,Just take the offer haha. I feel strongly like you’ll confuse the seller or risk losing your offer.
relationships,fh98lmq,t3_f1vypc,1581375553.0,"What a dumb thing to say to someone. Your boyfriend might not have wanted to hurt you, he may have been thinking he was just being really open and honest, but that’s so stupid. It’s especially stupid that he can’t fully move on from her because ‘sex was really good’. There’s just so much dumb in all of that. You’re fully not wrong for feeling hurt, your boyfriend needs a filter."
ShitMomGroupsSay,fh950x3,t1_fh94zlt,1581373502.0,Ohhhhhh. That makes so much more sense. XD Thanks!
ShitMomGroupsSay,fh91ku7,t1_fh8kx5u,1581371803.0,I heard the CREEPIEST story of someone’s kid getting approached by a stranger at the park because he recognized them from a family member he was friends with Facebook post. People need to be thinking more when they post photos of their kids online.
ShitMomGroupsSay,fh91grt,t1_fh8eh22,1581371734.0,"To be fair, some kids are insanely sneaky. I work with a lot of high schoolers and some very responsible parents with very reasonable rules and internet expectations and monitoring have still had issues."
ShitMomGroupsSay,fh909vf,t1_fh7vesw,1581371024.0,"I’m sure her kid was talking to a creep on discord. Police probably are involved. Blaming the chat app like she does, however, misses the point."
ShitMomGroupsSay,fh90248,t1_fh86w8s,1581370897.0,"Yeah I mean any chat service is going to have some creeps. It’s not the chat services fault, it’s he fact that kids have such easy access to technology now. There’s plus sides to that too, obviously, but safety can be a definite downside."
poshmark,fh8m208,t1_fh8lrw3,1581362609.0,Same! It’s another reason I stopped caring as much about reviews. Too much of that is out of my hands.
poshmark,fh8m02a,t1_fh8lng9,1581362577.0,I think that totally makes sense! And honestly (and this is all personal preference) I like to cut down on waste as much as possible while make sure an item arrives safely so I relate to that.
poshmark,fh8lwu0,t1_fh8lm91,1581362523.0,"That’s understandable. I’ve been burned before as a buyer (I had a package show up almost in pieces, which wasn’t the sellers fault, but the lack of any internal protection or wrapping or anything on the item that was also almost ruined was). But I think sometimes with all the free gifts and fancy cards and wrapping some people do expectations can be all over."
