I used dark chocolate instead of white chocolate for the ganache. I also used dark chocolate oreos in addition to regular oreos! Your gf will love it! I made it for my husband for his birthday and he said its the best cake I have made for him yet."

corgi,fddqqr9,t1_fdanehw,1578321475.0,I just replied to your other fairy spot post! Yes our corgis look like twins!! :)
corgi,fddp0fe,t3_ekgnoo,1578320032.0,"Yes! My corgi has a spot that looks just about the same as yours right on the middle of his little head :) In my opinion, it's the cutest part of him. Corgis are the best!"
corgi,fda81hv,t1_fda6om3,1578242785.0,"No! I designed the decal myself on my cricut machine last night and printed it on my own plain bag. I don't know who the hell this company is, but they stole my design within an hour of me posting this photo!"
corgi,fda5a3z,t1_fda4dip,1578241859.0,"I created the design on the bag and heat pressed it onto the canvas bag. I suppose I could start selling them :) Pupper is not for sale, haha sorry!"
corgi,f202wjm,t1_f1x3fbg,1569854487.0,This perfect specimen of a corgi was not up for adoption. We did get him from a breeder. I looked far and wide to adopt but Lupin was available and I snagged him up! Absolutely no regrets for this handsome pup!
