insaneparents,feh1dox,t3_ep25ke,1579107107.0,"Seems like some people take any form of parenting as insane. Maybe the kid is grounded, staying up to late, maybe the parent is just trying to be responsible and limit screen time."

TalesFromThePharmacy,fd51kvd,t3_ejoh94,1578173319.0,I love that they were so caught up on the stereotype that techs steal pain meds but was aghast that somebody would think about the stereotype that pain med patients might be trying to steal or sell them. Jumping to conclusions is alright apparently as long as they are the only one doing it.
insaneparents,fcc4qdi,t1_fcc3vry,1577594392.0,Maybe I don't quite get it because I didn't even live with my parents when I graduated high school but the original comment I replied to was saying that it's not unreasonable to expect your child who has graduated college to pay rent. If you still need a little time to get yourself out into the world then fine but personally I feel you should at least contribute to the household bills.
