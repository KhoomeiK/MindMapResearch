TwoXChromosomes,fdcx0kj,t3_ekon93,1578286795.0,Just throw three or four sheets of toilet paper in the water before you take a s***. Not a whole wad of it. Or the seat covers at public bathrooms. Toss one of those in the bowl before you sit. This works for guys also. They usually shit sitting down and don't like getting splashed either.

nevertellmetheodds,fcp1fur,t1_fcozf76,1577847541.0,"The tree was already dead. As you can see it had no solid trunk and would have come down on any unsuspecting persons in the area. I can't imagine this was for a timber harvest because of the paint on the tree ( they don't paint a tree trunk for timber harvesting). It seems it is marked a hazard tree. 
The person cutting it was keeping others safe by risking his life to do it. So people need to stop acting like they have any concept of how the timber industry  operates, unless you actually work in it. And don't say he deserves to be killed because he cut a tree."
