WTF,ffe59sq,t1_ffdurrp,1579837056.0,"Do not believe the roastie's lies

When she comes around to proselytize;

She'll screech and protest all day long,

Denying she's taken miles of schlong.




""Genetics!"" she will cry in fear,

Praying there is a white knight near;

But no help comes, there's no salvation

From the beta uprising sweeping the nation!


Innies are alright with me,

With their virtue and their purity;

They know what womanhood's about,

And with one voice cry: ""ROASTIES OUT!""


But beware the roastie's tempting calls,

Luring betas to her cavernous halls;

She'll suck you up, and then you'll be

A slave to her vile cuckoldry.


We see now, with our open eyes

The plainness of the roastie's lies;

We'll stick with innies, and nevermore

Shall we lie with an Arby's sandwich whore."
