Libertarian,fgdctle,t3_exu29e,1580681101.0,"While I agree with the majority of this. The president will probably be acquitted and it will look bad for the Democrats for not doing this right, not calling the witnesses they wanted right away, not requesting the documents they needed or wanted, rushing through the process then asking the Senate to slow down.
But let's not forget that both sides are acting like idiots in this impeachment. Mr. MCCONNELL stated before be ever got the Articles of Impeachment that he would acquit the President. This is not a sign of people who are going to listen to the arguements and be open to persuasion. This trial has been political from the beginning. Very few Senators asked questions to the opposition, only wanting to show their support for their party. The Replublican arguement has changed from ""did nothing wrong,"" to ""this whole process hasn't been fair.""
The undecided voter is the one left out in this whole process. The ""Church of Orange Man Bad,"" has already decided what happened as much as the ""Trumpian"" Republican has also decided. Not a single person involved in this trial has listened to the evidence and seen where it leads. That's the saddest part of this whole affair."

Christianity,ffbqnym,t1_ffbq04x,1579778835.0,"“Listen! Behold, a sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it. Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth of soil. And when the sun rose, it was scorched, and since it had no root, it withered away. Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain. And other seeds fell into good soil and produced grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.” And he said, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.” Mark 4:3-9

Do not dare to call me evil. You do not know me nor my heart. I asked only if your sowing of the seed is in the right place. The receiver must be willing to accept and if you force your beliefs into those that are not willing to accept you are sowing your seed on the rocky ground.

Who is your audience here? Who do you intend to redeem? Is this the best way to spread the Glorious News of Christ's saving Grace? I do not doubt you are a Child of God or that you are called to spread the good news as all believers are, I just ask that you know where you are sowing and not just throw the Gospel around as if it were seeds to be cast indiscriminately to the wind.
Be mindful and be purposeful. You cannot treat my God with such little respect."
