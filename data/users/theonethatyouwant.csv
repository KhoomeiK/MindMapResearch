predaddit,ffqo1rv,t3_euep5n,1580139617.0,"Hey man, you're not alone.  My wife and I BOTH felt the way you do.  We got pregnant three months into our marriage.  It was definitely not planned.  We wanted to at least experience 5 years of happy marriage first.  In a way, I guess I had it easier because my wife was also very much not into it.  But then again, having a wife who is breaking down mentally because of stress isn't exactly easy with a newborn.  That shit was rough.

But here I am, with a 1.5 year old son, and I love the daylights out of him and so does my wife.  Guess we're more toddler people than baby people.  Even though we're happy now, that doesn't mean we're not sad sometimes, or wonder ""what if"".  I think these things are all natural though, and the fake veneer we paint about how children are ""amazing gifts 24/7 and you suck if you don't always believe that"" is not only bullshit, but it's harmful.  There are ALWAYS ups AND downs.  It's not all rainbows.

Anyway, the best advice I can give, is focus on keeping your marriage strong and doing what needs to be done.  Your child really won't remember much of those early days, and you can basically ""fake it until you make it"".  At some point, you will develop feelings for your child.  It may take a while, but they'll come.  And when that happens, it gets easier.  It's never ""easy"" but it does get easier.

I honestly couldn't imagine my life without my son now.  My wife and I definitely struggled through this, and it almost broke our marriage at some points, but in the end it's made us stronger.  We have come to realize this is a good thing, and we should make the best of what we have.

Stay strong brother."

sadcringe,ffdq07g,t3_esb3i7,1579826194.0,"Ehh, I feel bad, but I was the guy on the OTHER side of this story once.

My best friend in college and I were at a party.  We ran into a girl we both knew from childhood and proceeded to hang out with her.  He apparently ""saw her first"" so when I hooked up with her that night, I was ""stealing her from him"".  The thought is utter bullshit.  He was and still is a virgin (in his 30s now) and she had no interest in him what so ever.

Similar things to this have happened multiple times in our friendship.  From like early high school on through adult hood.  A lot of guys think ""claiming"" a woman makes it so no one else can interact with them.  It's super weird and creepy IMO.  You know, women are people with opinions too?  It takes two people to tango, you can just WISH yourself into a girls pants.  She's gotta willingly let you in, man...

I don't know why I felt the need to tell that story.  I guess this shit triggered me cause he used to act like the victim if I ever had a girl.  Like it was my fault for being successful with women when he was so woefully bad at it.  We're still best friends, but I'm married now, so he can't blame me for failing any more."

Heated seats, aerated jets, warm water (I recommend tankless over reservoir), warm air dry, self cleaning, and air freshener.  They all sounds superfluous, but when you spend a lot of time there, it’s quickly worth it.
