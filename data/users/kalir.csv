This is a common belief  in other foreign countries there is no “African-American” or “Asian-American” it’s just American.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fevfj19,t1_fevcwvh,1579396824.0,"Exactly my point. Any married man who loves their mil(assuming that means mother) would probably consider what they say from time to time but they will always listen and obey their wives. However we know that isn’t always the case. some guys still blindly willing to please and obey their mother even if they are married. Usually that ends bad for the guy and he pardons himself with the “what was I supposed to do?”  Defense.  Prince Harry’s current actions of leaving his family and royal title for his wife is a living answer of what a married man should do. Just shut up, Obey and listen to your wife and everybody that matters in the relationship will be happy."
BlackPeopleTwitter,feva0pc,t1_fev906h,1579394946.0,"Oh yeah in a perfect world your answer makes sense and we would never talk on such a situation. But, we don’t live in such a world and well despite you talking so proudly about how such a case doesn’t exist... it happens a lot. It’s a classic rock and a hard place scenario and married men (or women I don’t judge) has to live with through it daily."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fev704g,t1_fev318o,1579393849.0,"Oh trust me every married man knows what I’m talking about. It’s so known it’s used a punchline in movies and tv tropes. You might not have experienced it but most guys will before they die. I’ll make it understandable for you in a scenario:

Say that you got a son and you raise him to love and obey his mother. Well one day that son becomes a married man to a woman you still see as an outsider. Now eventually he visits you a lot less than you would like because he has a family to take care of. So you call him up and tell him to visit you this weekend. he hears you and wants to visit but his wife reminds him that funds are a bit tight to fly the family to visit you. He tells you not this month and you don’t like that answer. So you draw the “I’m your mother, obey me!” card. He wants to obey you but on his end of the phone his wife is looking at him like he better obey her or there will be consequences. Which side will the man listen to and obey? The mother who gave him life or the woman whom he has to spend the rest of his life? Prince harry recent actions now give every man the definitive answer: stand with your wife! Lol"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fev1unn,t1_feuzf25,1579392167.0,"No but it does help explain  my argument of why Harry agreed and stands by his wife. 

Think about it; It’s the ultimate answer to the classic question of “between your mother/grandmother and your wife who should a man obey to?”  And being a single male I’m amazingly quite ok with that.  

Seriously though, from now on any man that caves in and listen to his mother or his grandparents over his wife is going to be fucked! Because even a prince will cave in and follow his wife! What’s a guys excuse/defense going to be now? Lol"

BlackPeopleTwitter,fczu9ap,t1_fczrzto,1578108714.0,As someone who just recently did a deployment in that part of the world I can say China and Russia are getting bolder if not stronger influences in that region. We can’t sleep on them two for a second. Iran actually is doing slightly better than n. Korea with building nuclear wmds and they are always threatening Israel or trying to start stuff with the us navy in the Middle East. Which in turn always makes us wary with them. Saudi Arabia is on our list too don’t trip.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fczpsmq,t1_fcznhuc,1578106458.0,"Well for starters, we still beef with China in regards of naval/air power and they actually are getting better with their weaponry.  That’s a naval and air force situation. 

Despite the frenzy over this general (who actually was a supporter of a terrorist group); the world is not through with terrorism so you always looking for the bad guys and sniffing out their groups. Those said bad guys got family that want revenge so they are always building new groups to finish whatever their loved ones started. That’s an army and marine problem. 

And we are now starting to defend ourselves more against cyber warfare. remember the ransomware virus? Imagine it being made by one of the countries we are not friends with like n.korea. Yeah that’s a problem every tech in the military has to watch out for.  Not to forget we got domestic terrorists.

When you drag a human being from their family/original lifestyle and force them to work so you can make a monetary gain you are still doing slavery and it’s still wrong. Both religions saw Africans as a profitable resource and used the group as such. Sure one took it too far but let’s not act like the latter is the “eternal peace keepers of the world “. Middle eastern slavers captured Africans and sold them to Europeans who gave the middle eastern enslavers money and tools to do their job more efficiently. I hate that my religion is connected to such a bad history of mankind. But I didn’t convert to Christianity because of my family or religions past history. I converted because I wanted to and the teachings align more with what I was taught as a kid.
