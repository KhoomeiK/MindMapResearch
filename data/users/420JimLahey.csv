premiere,fh8xaic,t1_fh8v286,1581369267.0,For some reason all the clips are 1920x1080 but the clip that's giving me problems is 512x288. Is there a way to fix this?

videography,fgy1yrs,t3_f0t5ye,1581178666.0,Expecting creatives to do work for free is a great way to make no one want to work with you. Sure it seems fun but this is these peoples jobs. You can't expect them to just go out shoot and edit for you for free because you think it's just a chill day on the beach

buildmeapc,fgt9q80,t1_fgrv2jp,1581101457.0,I guess that's true. Ill probably go with that one. The case is out of stock on Amazon. Does it matter which one I swap it out with?

wholesomememes,fgoa6l5,t1_fgnemo7,1580963678.0,Let's just hope the shelter is doing proper background checks!
wholesomememes,fgn4fx3,t1_fgmfqeb,1580937518.0,I can see that being possible. Most shelters do background checks and make sure dogs are going to homes that can support them. you also have to think of it as advertising. If a super bowl champion was supporting my local shelter it would be packed the next day with people who want dogs and could care for them.
wholesomememes,fglgtl8,t1_fgl9oix,1580897031.0,I think it probably means he donated enough money to cover all the adoption fees of dogs in the shelter so that when people come in to adopt a dog the fees will be waived

videography,ffugizr,t3_ev50bv,1580241478.0,How much should someone starting out charge for a 30-60 sec commercial? I've seen people on Reddit say around $1500. I know the businesses in my area are not going to pay that especially to someone who doesn't have a background in it. My only project right now is a commercial I made for the pizza company I work for. I've gotten a ton of positive feedback for it but it was filmed on my Pixel 2XL because that's the only camera I have. What's a good price to set for more commercials I may make?

VideoEditing,fe0o1u8,t1_fdt5gw3,1578816639.0,That's what I've been doing today and I actually have gotten a hang of it at least a tiny bit. What computer do you use? My laptop is not cutting it. It freezes up way too much so it's time to upgrade
VideoEditing,fe0nuyd,t1_fduadjv,1578816561.0,I recommend Daniel Scott walkers courses on udemy. They're only 10 dollars and you will learn everything. Each course comes with all the downloadable files you'll need and they each have at least 5 hours of lectures. Highly recommend
VideoEditing,fdsr3dx,t1_fdsimpb,1578706852.0,That was always my problem when I was learning illustrator. Once I found udemy I loved it because it's all very clearly set up and easy to follow
