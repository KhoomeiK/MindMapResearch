depression,fdn0bz8,t3_em40kf,1578573287.0,"i like phisical contact but only with friends there was a great guy and i think it was my first crush ever? but also the only one
we started dating and the affection from purely friendly turned to something more romantic
i hated it. at first i told him to stop doing it this much but even then i was bending away from him touch 
we started seeing each other less and less and i saw i was hurting him
we talked and decided it will be best for us to break up
I still fell bad for what i done but also haven't had any even a bit romantic relationship because i am so afraid that it will happen again"
depression,fc3xi8y,t3_eg1ib1,1577401165.0,"Right now i am in two groups 
one is a literal clusterfuck where everyone is somehow depressed. I met those guys first and they  said that it's okay to vent, but they joked about it a lot. not so long ago I met people, dare I say, healthy, i have to interact with them bc of school and it's just so hard to adjust since my way of copying is either turning everything into a joke or cutting myself off from everyone"
