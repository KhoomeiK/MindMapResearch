Pennsylvania,fdhi9a6,t1_fdhi2ut,1578423211.0,It's not the same conclusion. Amoral and immoral are two way different things. If you think they believe women are amoral then it's downplaying how much they hate independent women and abortion.
Pennsylvania,fdhfw0n,t1_fdheyjs,1578421782.0,"You only told me the definition of ""amoral"", never explained how they think women are amoral.

I have a feeling it's because you can't, because you used the wrong word.

They don't think women have no concept or concern of morality without a man. They just think women are immoral for seeking abortions or not wanting to have children."
