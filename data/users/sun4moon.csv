sex,feiajld,t3_epayje,1579133986.0,"I would caution against using fingers first. As a woman I can verify that fingers are rougher than a penis. Definitely go veeeeerrrrrrrryyyyyy slow, not just the first time but always. Unless she says otherwise. Protect yourself too. A condom is a good idea to prevent any bacteria from irritating your penis. Many things can cause irritation for you. Always wash thoroughly after and if you decide not to use a condom make sure you pee right after."
