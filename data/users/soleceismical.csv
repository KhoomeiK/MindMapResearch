LifeProTips,ff00h1h,t1_fexdt8g,1579463845.0,">Having the largest meal in the morning appears to have advantages for weight control compared with having a large meal in the evening, she said, since the digestive process and the action of insulin, the pancreatic hormone that the body uses to process the sugars in carbohydrates and store glucose, appear to be at their peak performance early in the day. As a result, â€œour body can use the nutrients as a source of energy the easiest,â€ Dr. Kahleova said.

>A person eating the identical meal at different times of day might deposit more fat after an evening meal than a morning meal, she said.

>Thatâ€™s because insulin action is more efficient in the morning, experts say. â€œIf you give a healthy individual a big bolus of glucose in the morning, the blood glucose might stay high one or two hours before coming back to normal,â€ said Dr. Satchidananda Panda, a professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego. â€œYou take that same normal healthy individual and give them the same bolus of glucose late at night, and now the pancreas is sleeping â€” literally â€” and cannot produce enough insulin, and blood glucose will stay high up to three hours.â€ Doctors once called this â€œevening diabetes,â€ he said.

The article also discusses and links to a study that randomly assigned people to a large breakfast or large dinner, with some very interesting results in favor of not eating most of your calories later in the day. The biggest problem is that most people work during the daylight hours and making a nutritious daytime meal(s) takes time (or planning beforehand). 

Also, biscuits and muffins are usually refined grains (the germ and bran of the grain have been removed along with the fiber, b vitamins, iron, and healthy fatty acids). Best to have whole foods and a combo of whole carbs, protein, and healthy fats for sustained energy.

It's based on the [Housing for Older Persons Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_for_Older_Persons_Act) signed by Clinton in 1995. The best way to avoid having to abide by the rules in such a community is to not move into a community with such rules.

Some other residents probably have grandkids they'd like to have move in as well (maybe the parents have opioid addiction or some other troubles), but can't because then the community would run afoul of the law, which makes them lose their status permanently.

WHtR is the ratio of your waist circumference to your height. Probably not a bad idea to keep an eye on what that number is for you personally, and keep track of whether it increases.

You can also get a DXA scan to see how much and where on your body you carry your adipose and lean tissue. It can also tell you if your right arm has more muscle than your left, hahaha.

>Michelle Swainson, PhD, and her co-authors collected measurements from 40 women and 41 men using a total body dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner, which offers a more accurate way to gather information on body composition and fat. From there, they calculated 5 predictors of whole-body fat and VAT, each of which could be done in minutes in a physicianâ€™s office to gauge obesity.

>They found that 36.5% more adults could be classified as obese using the whole body data rather than the BMI measurements. The other predictors they tested were waist circumference, waist-to-hip, waist-to-height, and waist-to-height0.5. Waist-to-height was the most accurate. The calculation measures waist circumference divided by height, using cut points of 0.53 for men and 0.54 for women for whole body obesity, and 0.59 for abdominal obesity in both genders.

Most people do not consume the recommended daily amount of choline (450 - 550mg, depending on sex, pregnancy and lactation status), and the leading diet source (beef liver) has declined in popularity. Also, as a water soluble B vitamin, choline is depleted by alcohol. Estrogen helps produce some choline in the body, which may be why we see more issues with boys and men.

I understand a lot of people have experienced some form of trauma in the past and don't need to be triggered when they're just out and about doing their daily business, but I have also seen trauma (at a trauma-informed care training) defined as risk of injury or death to oneself or a loved one as *perceived* by the traumatized person. So some people can go through an experience not really realizing how real the risk was and be totally fine, where as some may have a much greater perception of threat (and more subsequent trauma) than others. I think the internet and news play a big role in causing people to overestimate threats due to availability bias. I know for myself, although I've dealt with relatively little in the way of sexual assault compared to many of my friends, finding out about all of their rapes and assaults at once during the height of metoo really dampened my sex drive for a while because scary stuff was the first thing that came to mind.
