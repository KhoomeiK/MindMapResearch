fbhw,fdlzc5s,t1_fdizqq9,1578536104.0,"l337dexter is right though. Hot Wings was already afraid of coasters, but was somehow talked into doing a simple wooden coaster at Hershey park and he absolutely hated it. There's no chance he would *ever* agree to getting on an actual coaster. There are certain things HW puts his foot down firmly about, and that's one of them."
