I killed a frog when i was a little kid.  It fucked me right up, I remember it like it was yesterday.  The frog did absolutely nothing to me except try to be a frog and I walked by, picked it up and smashed it on a rock.  It was still breathing and its guts were hanging out.  This was almost 30 years ago but that memory is so clear.  Something just snapped inside me and I started crying.  I realized in that moment I couldn't undo what I had just done, and an innocent creature had just been snuffed out for no reason by my hand.  It was an act of evil, and I was an agent of evil. 

Whatever it was, *that day*, from that moment on, I was a changed person.  I have nothing but compassion for animals and nothing but enmity towards people who abuse them, and when I read stories like this I always think back to that little boy and the poor frog who gave its life so that I could be imbued with a respect for all forms of life.

IBEW,fehq5uo,t3_ep7x0u,1579121661.0,"This sounds a bit schmaltzy but I really do feel there's a stronger bond between workers on a union job.  We all make the same amount of money, do the same work, break the foreman's balls...and simply by being in the union it usually means you're gonna have *some* sort of common ground with your co-workers.  To me, that's huge.  I've worked at non-union shops where everyone's stabbing everyone else in the back (this happens at union jobs too but people seem better at sniffing out the bullshit), no one gets along, everyone's screaming all day and an 8 hour day turns into a 10 hour day and the pay clock stops when you *start* driving back to the yard rather than driving home.  Fuck that.

The money is obviously a big thing for most guys but it isn't terribly important to me.  I really like the sense of brotherhood, and union workers are more likely to help you out than to try to screw you over for their own gain.

The only disadvantage of union work I've come across is that layoffs happen more often.  Depending on where you live that could be more of a problem, or it could not be a problem at all.  Hell, I sometimes look forward to the seasonal layoff, although I haven't gotten one in two years now.  And even then it's never more than a couple weeks."

Look, I think he's the GOAT coach and I love the guy but he flat-out screwed up yesterday.  My *theory* is that, going into halftime, he was afraid one of two things would happen: 1. The pats go 3 and out quickly giving the ball back to the dolphins with time for them to score (a valid concern, I'll admit) or 2. The *Patriots* drive down the field and score, which would give the team a morale boost going into halftime and sort of blunt the chewing-out he was going to give them in the locker room.  If you're going to tear your team a new asshole, it loses much of its sting if your team can just point to the scoreboard in rebuttal.
