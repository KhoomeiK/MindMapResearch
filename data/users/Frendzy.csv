college,fejvg5i,t1_fej86p8,1579186769.0,Sounds to me like Peter had his own things going on. Like something that woul hold him back in terns of understanding social cues and normal social behaviour.
college,fej57nu,t1_fej4p65,1579157375.0,"No i for sure agree that that would be weird as hell, I go to one of the cheapest colleges in my state state so there's a ton of different people/backgrounds to get to know which is helpful as far as making friends goes. I mean its kinda different to sit next to people in class and talk before it starts than it is to walk up to someone randomly in the cafeteria."
college,feiyurv,t1_feiycx4,1579151091.0,I would definitely see your professor then as most professors co sider that the real evidence of trying (also i think they appreciate the attention).
college,feiy3u6,t3_epchz8,1579150445.0,I'm not uber social but I always remember the kids that ask my name when they sit at the same table/row and we start to talk a little bit that can be a pretty good way to get to know someone a little bit. Living on campus has also really helped bc I see a lot of the same people everyday and kinda get to know them. I've actually made a few friends by joining already existing friend groups.
college,feix7u8,t3_epdl78,1579149704.0,"I can be pretty horrendous at math I've found that getting tutoring while I'm doing homework can be pretty damaging. If you have a tutoring service at you school I would take the homework that you've already completed there and have them check it over, that way they can see where you're at at what your thought processes are and maybe give you better help that way. Finding a tutor that you mesh with can also be hard so I recommend shopping around to find someone who you can actually learn from.

Another thing I do is figure out what part of the problem I'm not understanding and watch videos (Khan academy is pretty good I put it at 1.5x or 2x to stay sane) specifically on that issue. I'm in pretty much the same boat, lit and social sciences are definitely my strong subjects but I gotta get that STEM money.

Also never forget the power of setting up an appointment with your professor and going over what you don't understand. often times when a professor knows that you're having a hard time they will go the extra mile to help just you and maybe even go further into explaining topics in class."
college,feiw98x,t3_epdn9w,1579148925.0,"I was usually able to submit an unofficial transcript that included the credits I got in 8th grade. as far as the colleges I applied to were concerned, an unofficial transcript was good enough during the early stages of applying."
college,feivxav,t3_epdxst,1579148666.0,In my opinion there's nothing worse especially when people try to sneak it in in the first or second week of the semester like no one sees it happen. If you want to sit in some place that s not your assigned seat wait until most people are there and just ask if you can sit next to whoever has the seat you want.
AskReddit,fdfyo56,t3_el6py2,1578373940.0,"I've found that compartmentalizing while im watching the movie means that I won't have any nervesafter I finish watching. I just put the scary parts away so I remember the story but the horror parts don't stick as well.

To actually answer the question, I just go to bed like normal."
teenagers,fdd07bn,t3_ekphf4,1578289695.0,Just be yourself. Also if and when you're choosing where you're gonna go on dates and stuff think outside of what's traditionally romantic and take your crushes interests into account.
teenagers,fdczxpv,t3_ekphp2,1578289433.0,I say keep growing for a while and see if you like the results in a couple weeks.
NoStupidQuestions,fdczdmv,t3_ekpi1w,1578288902.0,The bartender and the bar they work for. If the minor had a fake id that's passable as a real id tho the minor would be in more trouble.
AskReddit,fdcza2g,t3_ekpi5l,1578288809.0,I don't know abt legally but in my experience as long as your ID says you're old enough they just let you buy it/do the thing
teenagers,fdcz55t,t1_fdcyn54,1578288685.0,"You might also want to start walking to class and such with friends if you don't already, so there's witnesses and in case she trys to start something while your back is turned"
teenagers,fdcyf8j,t3_ekp682,1578288029.0,"You should take some classes boxing, kickboxing, jujitsu, etc. if you can. When you go to make a fist don't tuck in you thumb punching someone hurts no matter what but if you tuck in your thumb chances are you'll break it an you wont be able to throw another punch.

If you're gonna hit someone follow through, pretend you're punching behind them or through them it will give you more power. If you focus the hit onto your first two knuckles the ones on your pointer and middle finger you're less likely to hurt yourself. Also aim for meatier areas if you can like cheek instead of cheek bone.

Most importantly wait until you get hit first, it won't help you if your school has (and it most likely does) a zero tolerance policy but it will help you claim self defence if her parents want to press charges. Also this post proves premeditation so hopefully people don't know abt your reddit

Edit: if you have thick (longways like they cover more of your finger) flat rings start wearing those if not on both hands then on your dominate hand. It might save your fingers and it will definitely do damage.
Make sure you start wearing them before the fight tho bc otherwise it will seem like you put them on specifically to hurt her. Maybe post abt how much you like your new rings on social media or smthg to cover yourself"

AskReddit,fd8hqxg,t3_ekaar4,1578218493.0,America would lose two major tax bases. I don't know about California but Texas would most likely be fine. One concern for Texas would be the influx of immigrants bc Texas is so large the times of instability would lead to immigrants from all sides and Texas is already facing a housing crisis. For perspective el paso to Brownsville is about 2/3 of the us's boarder with mexico. Texas is a very big boy with very expansive borders
relationship_advice,fd8fp2p,t3_ekac06,1578217876.0,If you have kids the answer is entirely different but if nit its just a matter of trying to make it work by being honest. Tell her what you're thinking and feeling and her response/receptiveness should tell you what you need to know about your relationship. I would also recommend seeing a couples therapist that is not religiously affiliated to help guide your conversations about it. Do research bc sometimes couples therapist don't display that they are faith based.

teenagers,fd8dpkt,t1_fd8come,1578217199.0,"Absolutely not true for a number of reasons. Hot women date unattractive dudes all the time like I got to meet a bunch of my college friends boyfriends recently and literally all of them are dating guys less conventionally attractive than them, they date them bc of the things they have in common and the things they are passionate abt.

Just going to the store, movies, the park you're gonna see people dating out of their league, its perfectly normal."
teenagers,fd8c28e,t1_fd8b5fw,1578216624.0,"Absolutely true but not being what is considered conventionally attractive isn't gonna stop people from getting into relationships bc there is always someone who will find you attractive. Physical attractiveness is also not as important for women as it is for men a lot of it has to do with personality particularly for women.

You're also at a really unfortunate age 12ish-17ish where everybody's simultaneously at their most awkward and meanest mostly guys at their most awkward and girls at their meanest so it will eventually calm down"
teenagers,fd8ar75,t1_fd89ksm,1578216041.0,It absolutely isn't and it sucks that you feel that way. High school can make it feel like that though. Just remember that high school is not a representation of real adult life or even college/young adult life.
relationship_advice,fd8ae5o,t3_ekadl3,1578215884.0,"You absolutely should tell Eric and if its safe to do so you should tell your parents too. If you're comfortable you should absolutely report him to the police so that if he's done it before or does it again the cops can establish a pattern of behavior and the other people that he may do it to can get justice.

Be prepared to potentially lose a friend or have things be rocky for a while but its important to tell someone in this situation. Also absolutely don't go over to his house anymore it puts you at serious risk for a lot of reasons."
teenagers,fd88qn4,t3_ekadpv,1578215311.0,"I don't think this is fair to girls at all. Plenty of girls are attracted to guys who aren't considered attractive. I've been hanging with friends multiple times talking abt whatever and someone will say they find x guy attractive and while the rest of the group might not agree shes still into said guy for x reason. Reasons like they're funny or they find their crooked nose kinda cute, etc.

There's somebody for everybody as long as you've got a good attitude abt it. A huge red flag for a lot of girls is when guys mention that girls only lile dude who are fit or conventionally attractive."
AskReddit,fd87ov0,t3_ekadpx,1578214870.0,"I mean it depends on what teenage means like 13 or 19? But also when are you turning off the internet? Is it when they're in the middle of a game or tv show, imagine grabbing a book out of someones hands without warning before they finish the chapter they're on. Are you giving them warning before turning it off? Is it a 5 minute im going to turn it off or do you warn and then immediately turn it off.

Its pretty frustrating when someone takes something away without communicating first. Kids are annoying but they're still people who get frustrated when their agency is taken away.

If they're crying about it even after being warned and having time to prepare, then they're just gonna have to get a hobby/find other ways to be fulfilled, but if they're rightly frustrated because you're trying to see things from their point of view then they're not going to adjust easily at all."
