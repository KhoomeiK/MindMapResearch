LetsTalkMusic,ff2a57e,t1_ff23zzi,1579498374.0,"I haven't heard the song, but after reading the lyrics, it looks like Pop's is suggesting that the notion of african americans returning to Africa and to some sort of primitive land may be rather misguided. Especially is they fly to Africa and airports are present. 

At the same time, there is sort of a marvelling that there is an interest in returning to the jungles. I think Pop feels that white people don't have any conception of themselves as having been in a jungle despite Darwin's best efforts. But, the mimicry that Pop describes in the opening looks to be a simplification, but may explain the trouble. African Americans and perhaps even white people see the jungle and that sort of primitivism (I think this is what the ideology of returning to the moment of being plucked from some part of Africa is called) as linked to the African American identity. African Americans were once faced with the challenge of copying, at least if I may connect Pop to the old question of African Americans assimilating like other immigrants into American society, or enacting this other image of their identity as sort of survivalist. The want of changing into that lifestyle or culture, which is the thrust of the last line, suggests to me that the trouble is that African Americans want to be able to develop themselves as themselves. But, they can't get away from americans and other white people. Their predicament is complicated by the duplicity of an identity linked to hundreds of years ago, or in the sense of some societies that are often conceptualized as tribal, and the modernity of white people, which also seems separate yet present. 

This is just how I read the song though. Overall, I don't know if Pop is really serious about conceiving African Americans as inferior to white people. He may be envious given his tendency to act like an animal or his recent song ""Paraguay"" where he rants about modernity and its sickening effects on him. Again, Pop probably has no conception of the old German villages (or whatever his nationality), especially not of any society like those commonly associated with Africa. Oddly enough, there is this perhaps common idea of masculinity as a hunter, which is sort of questioned. Does one eat skunks as a mighty hunter or learn about tigers close-up? Yet, isn't there an appeal in hunting and catching your own food, especially without trapping and shooting it from afar? Does such a disadvantage degrade hunting, especially in the sense of surviving in some jungle? But, does one really want to kill and eat a monkey, or some other non-carnivorous animal? If monkey see, monkey do, then monkeys may become a threat, haha."

Take a mortgage. A negative interest rate would give the debtee money, which would likely go toward paying the principal. The debtor finds it riskier to accept the lowering of the total debt than not extending the credit at all. Cash, or debt to be precise, becomes a liability not only for the debtee but also the debtor instead of a sole asset. We might not see that liability on the balance sheet, but we know that the interest rate is lowering the principal loan, or the value of the contract, which is part of debt swapping. Accounts receivable decreases without a proportionate rise in cash because the bank has to pay its debtee. 

In a nutshell, profit-making takes on a myopic frenzy. For a country engrossed in debt like the US, this phenomenon may sound appealing. Unfortunately, the instability of the economy, production, growth, consumption, and monetary value seem to be imploding."

davidfosterwallace,fedhlwu,t3_eohsyu,1579011733.0,"As I read the quote, Bidart seems to be suggesting that there are these pre-defined ideas of what things are. Not necessarily an essentialism, but a construction. For example, are you an accountant, or is there something about the work of accounting and its ideas that you affect with your relationship to them? Perhaps not and you just do as you are told. Yet, even then you are changing with the compliance. Kafka's Metamorphosis comes to mind here, although I do not mean to be so provocative. Nevertheless, there are these constructions that go into motion with one's filling animation. 

Now, I think Wallace is doing a couple of things here. First, I think he is invoking a pun with forms like those for taxing or allowances or affidavits or some other document with a bunch of information and places for us to interact with it. In a weird way, the monotony of the forms seems dismantled when we consider this relationship. Yet, the preponderance of forms to document so much of one's life seems countervailed by the idea of the filing cabinet. Or, by the idea of them being used against us, or the anguish of filling out forms to no end. In the first two examples, a clear anxiety exists with a feeling of self-loss and being controlled. I think one way of reading this allusive epigram is to understand Wallace's point as when we suspend ourselves from the forms we are filling out, we are still changed by them in a fashion that may be rather frustrating or trapping. Yet, when we are part of the changing and participating with it, or can face anxieties like the forms being used against the filler, then we are living with the creation. It may be that Heraclitus thought the essence of things to be fire, but Wallace might suggest we reconsider the form, or the little template filled out to capture or reflect the construction. Further, our participation affects forms. Tax forms changed just in 2017. There is a self-reflexivity here that may be able to help us when we drown in paperwork as the saying goes."

literarydiscussion,fe6b19j,t3_enqer7,1578885868.0,"Marlowe is a difficult character, one who seems to show his thoughts through defraction of his more immediate speech. Is he buddha-like because of some profound distance from human suffering by surrounding himself with it as someone unencumbered? Or is he actually more like an ancient mariner and hauntingly compelled to tell his tale? This is just one example of the complexity of the characters, moreso Marlow, that Conrad leaves the reader to inter-relate with. 

At one level, I think Conrad is suggesting that while some weighting moral trouble has fallen up Western man, it is not simple to unfurl it. Especially as we sit in a boat moving toward our own encounters. 

That being said, I don't think Conrad finds the Congo imperialism or business dealings laudable. I don't think Conrad is arguing Africans are sub-human or savage. They are at such a distance, they seem more of a foil. Moreso, I think Conrad's presentation of the Africans may be accurate for the expropriation that appears to have occured. 

I think your thematic inquiry is interesting, but I don't agree that Conrad supports the sort of imperialism he describes in Heart of Darkness. He appears to believe this trajectory is rather pleonexic and fears what human beings are becoming. The people in that novel seem to suffer PTSD-like behavior; they seem to have killed themselves instead of killing others in some sense. Dealing with this new selfhood seems horrifying, leaving us with an option like Kurtz's beloved to believe madeup stories and choose denial or repudiation. Or, one can confront where that boat is heading as the story concludes. The scariest thing about this book may be that the choices will remain consistent with Marlow's story. 

On another note, if you don't enjoy Conrad, that is cool, too. But, I think there is more to Heart of Darkness."

Nietzsche,fdxin1l,t3_en8ck9,1578769062.0,"It looks like the main theic point for you is the conception of the self as a static sort of object. I would suggest that the self and character are different entities, although character seems to be intimately related to the self. As for the equivalence of psychological character traits with virtue and vice: if you mean that this equivalence is mistaken, I agree. I think trying to take virtue ethics as a foreground for psychology, or as a metaphysics for psychology, or vice-versa, is mistakenly eclectic and attempts to subdue complexities toward a simplified, seemingly synthetic theory. Toward the self, I think pinning it down with situationaism and virtue ethics creates a subject/object, an independent/dependent variable, or in short: is not supported by the method. Situationism seems to suggest that traits, or influences, override character and either reveal or articulate the self. Virtue ethics, which does not negate the situation, would seem to have a different interpretation. Yet, the self as a static preformation does not seem to be necessarily the case in virtue ethics, nor the selfsame for character. 

Depending on the focus of the virtue ethics discourse, we can find a fluid self. I think McIntyre takes that approach as well as Annas. Personally, I didn't read Aristotle has arguing for a solid self in the sense of this formed unit that needs to be subdued, but he is concerned with the development of character. Now, I can see where the teleology of Aristotle can be taken to suggest a fixed and central point whose staticity interferes with phenomena. But, I also think the concern with continence can be considered as an interest in virtue's deployment, which is of the situation's milieu. Of course, the classic example of the bodybuilder is recalled here, which can be taken to see the self as a preformed body whose virtues, or muscles, need to be exercised. However, I think this account need not prevent a movement toward virtue as something else. I think, rather, virtue might not be so potentially internal with the self and character simply flexing it. I think rather, the conception of flourishing, or eudaimonia, suggests that character is more external to the self. Daimon being something both personal and seemingly external, even if ot be reduced to an internal dialogue. Character as a daimon seems to be more like something forming while the self flows with situations. This does not make character static as Aristotle does not argue that the virtuous or vicious person is locked into their character until their death. Even the beast or the godlike can turn. 

Now, expose aside: where does Nietzsche fit in? First, some argue that Nietzsche is a virtue ethicist. Nietzsche resists categorization, but some of his ideas may be typological. I think one could conceive of an ubermensch as a metamorphosis of self and character, for example. As for virtues, I don't think Nietzsche is against virtue, but is against the deployment. The conception of self-denial, as you referenced, is not necessarily part of virtue ethics. At least, not as I understand the system and Nietzsche. The resintement of virtue ethics that Nietzsche locates in virtue ethics is geneaological. That virtue ethics, the aesthetic or even more Christian conception, is not Aristotle and Plato's. The master morality that the Greeks played with was not so nuanced in a sense. If I am not mistaken, these masters were oddly more simple yet life-affirming for Nietzsche. That is to say, the question of virtue for the Greeks may be less Victorian or Augustinian than prima facie suggests. I think the rightness Aristole is concerned with can be better understood with his golden mean: virtue is intermediate between a deficiency and excess. Courage is not a suppression of strength or passion, but an awareness of its activation so as to prevent an excess or a deficiency. Aristotle doesn't value a weakness of courage, or cowardice, but he recognizes the value of attributes like stepping back from the situation. 

It may be that the Christian, or Victorian, notion takes a diametric opposition. But, Aristotle sets up a polarity of expression that should be euryhthymic. He is not looking for denying either of the poles that meet at virtue, but seeking to deploy those powers or attributes appropriate to the situation. Now, I agree with you that taking this interpretation to mean one has formed a static self, or that the becoming is prefigured by a solidified monad, would be a mistake. I have seen disagreements with Aristotle like that, and I do agree that becoming courageous as a sort of unviersalization with some deducible category broaches the sort of problems Kant runs into, albeit in a different manner. What's more, virtue as the central point can be structurally limiting or eschewing. Nonetheless, I think Nietzsche is correct in not allowing the self or character to side-track morality or ethics. Moreover, character seems to be a construction of virtue ethics as much as the self for other thoughts. But, the awareness of that construction seems to be the critical point for Nietzsche. What we create, as he suggests in On Truth and Lies with the opening fable, does not enter the realm of nature or what is. Our understanding is not an actuality that is removed from us, but a conception of our subjectivity with some objecitfications. 

Now, to your notion about guilt and responsibility, you make an interesting point. But, guilt or responsibility may rely on the idea of the subject's continuity as much as on structures of thought. One could move from virtue to objectivism to deonotlogy as business ethics scholars like to suggest. Moreso, I think the fundamental issue is actually more at the surface. Allowing these structures, our conception of ourselves, our subjectivities, to be determined without bethinking. By negating them through their affirmation, we fall into the sort of trouble Plato depicts Socrates taking on as his mission. When we know everything, we cannot know nothing. Although it is a seemingly trite point, when we give up thinking for ourselves, or when our subjectivity is given to some structure and resistance becomes an acceptance of our forlornness, we have become that static body incarcerated. And perhaps, in a sort of Lyotard-esque way, it was by some manner of choice or fulfilment. But, I do think virtue ethics, or more precisely: a morality considering virtue, can be interested in taking on this problem. While the golden mean is one structure, we can disagree. Personally, I take the point to be a weighing and testing of actions' character as well as the character of one performing such an action. I should also point out that we seem to be mostly focused on habitual and not intellectual Aristotelian virtue, which is a bit different. Anywho, I cannot find virtue ethics infallible, but I do think there is some wisdom worth considering for one's own living, especially in moving beyond Aristotle's occidental, systematic starting point. Sometimes, the system's dismantling leaves us with the valuable parts that guided the builders."

askphilosophy,fds7s8a,t3_emvfv9,1578696288.0,"Hmm. 

Sounds like a sort of transcendental solidarity, or something like Nietzsche's idea that one one should overcome being ""man"". That is to say, rebellion connects one to the experience of solidarity with other human beings as something more ideal, or perhaps ontological, viz. For the individual qua a sort of gestalt toward humanity. One does not rebel for themselves, but through rebellion discovers something more ontological: solidarity, or an interconnected support, with human beings. Rebellion places one in contact with something more overarching than the individual: their shared humanity. We overcome our sense of dissimilitude with rebellion, or so Camus might suggest. 

At another level, Camus may be read as suggesting that the idea of solidarity is prefigured by struggle, a resistance whose conscious expression is rebellion. One realizes their connection with other human beings, not by a sharing of human characteristics or mutual  evolution per se, but by considering the expression of rebellion or a challenging resistance. Here, I wonder, is where one may find the atmosphere of living for and with others as they reciprocate, perhaps even finding that rebellion surrounds humanity."

Of course, Nietzsche constantly references his other works, so the chronological aspect of his work is something he is aware of. He even discusses his immaturity in the Genealogy's preface. He also talks about different philosophers like Kant and Schopenhauer, so he seems to request some familiarity with the philosophical context he criticizes. In that way, his critique is more incisive. 

With Zarathustra, you have a piece of literature. So, the apothegems and reflectivity of Nietzsche's work is going to be magnified and expanded by symbols, settings, characters, and more. Whether you read it during a nascent or experienced movement through Nietzsche's work, you are better off reading it a few times whether successive or spaced out or both. In the preface for the Genealogy, he suggests that what he wants is every  word he filled with his muse  to be imbibed by the reader. Nonetheless, the text is difficult and rich. The eponymous character is a prophet of Zoroastrianism after all. 

So, the reader will give you a nice catalogue to enter Nietzsche's thought. Zarathustra will strike you over the head with it, lol.

I heard the key to his more academic work is to read it chronologically. 

Are you familiar with Rick Roderick?

Yeah. I'm not sure why Kant's question about the limits of reason received the reaction it does. But, that is a power of criticism: revelation. 

Lol. People place Nietzsche in all sorts of camps. For example, there is Nietzsche the existentialist, Nietzsche the virtue ethicist, Nietzsche the postmodernist... His writing and influence are rather prolific though. Additionally, his influence on postmodernism and poststructuralism is undeniable. Foucault, Deleuze, and Heidigger are 3 examples of his influence. 

Right. I don't think anyone has any evidence to back up the apocalypse of postmodernism or poststructuralism. They are complex movements. I asked somebody about that fear and really did not get any citation of somebody like Derrida destroying rationality. He fell back on postmodernists not reading the classics, which doesn't seem to be true either. Postmodernism re-engages history; postmodernist do not limit their reading to today's books. 

Sure. Nietzsche has a popular text called ""On Truth and Lies in the Extra-Moral Sense"". He tells this short parable about a world becoming enlightened when people create reason after millions of years before the world goes dark again. As I read Nietzsche, he is not calling reason a farce, but suggesting the apotheosis is over-rated. People are still people and, like mosquitos, annoyingly focused on their centricity. One of the reasons I place Nietzsche with the poststructuralists is his commitment to not accepting predefined structures of thought or cultural norms as defining him and his actions. He thinks for himself, and this originality is important to poststructuralists. Of course, this value is not unique here, but I think the poststructuralists were able to put their fingers on changing trends and ideas extraordinarily well. I think they also succeed in pointing out what Nietzsche suggests in that essay: maybe the present understanding, the attending stories, and our commitment to that structure are misunderstanding or ignoring some important aspects. For example, Foucault's critique of the panopticon makes it difficult to accept the idea of not only surveillance reforms, but to accept present ideas that are already codified, allowing that sort of surveillance. Nevertheless, Bentham is a great reformer... The need for reconsideration and change is clear. 

Thank you for the love. 

... I honestly find it difficult to believe people care about Aristotelian essentialism... Or categories. I'm not too sure what is meant by essentialism, but maybe I need to read Metaphysics to get the argument. I've read some of his Organum, and my impression of Aristotelian categories is that we analyze diction in order to see how it is used and create categories for the things discussed in order to discuss and deduce. Granted, I didn't finish the text, but even his Nicomachean Ethics doesn't argue for 10 indelible virtues; Aristotle takes 10 from cultural discourse. Is virtue no longer real? 

What's more, virtue is the golden mean; it is a recognition of 2 vices, or spheres of vice, converging into an excellence relative to some situation. I'm not sure if that really shows an essentialism... At least in a Platonic sense, but my impression of Aristotle is more like Kant and the noumenon. I don't think the essence of chairs are really at stake so much as the category of chair. What's more, I think this is part of the problem and maybe even what Nietzsche is alluding to. We haven't figured everything out with indelible definitions and understandings. We don't know everything and even strong arguments can suck... Kind of like Bentham's. That's okay though. What's not okay is perpetuating stories about Aristotelean conceptions that probably don't matter. I met an acquaintance who began to get at some of this topic with me because I told him I was writing about Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. He later remarked that our biggest problem in Western Society is the loss of Aristotelian reasoning. I laughed and shook my head. Not with intentional disrespect, but with disbelief that anyone would argue such a thing sincerely. Especially when I don't believe he's actually read Aristotle. Even if he did, using Aristotelian logic as a metanarrative is bad faith in my book. Newton replaced Aristotelian physics with a somehow more modern classical mechanics. But no one in 2020 feels Newton decimated scientific integrity.

I simply don't see how Aristotle is absolutely necessary for a donkey to be a donkey. What I think they are getting at is the picture-theory of language, which was attacked by structuralism before poststructuralism. But, again: nobody feels Sausserre destroyed reality. For some reason, the idea that we can talk about donkeys without referring to donkeys somewhere in objective reality makes people nauseous. The development may be major, but just like in Nietzsche's story: the world and time are the same as they were. If our understanding changed, so what? It is still open to good faith criticism. 

To be frank, your story sounds like a classic bait and switch was performed on you. You went from Butlerian gender theory per performance to Aristotelian essentialism. You went from gender to donkeys. I recommend you do a few things. 1) inquire how Aristotelian essentialism actually rebuts Butler's argument, asking your interlocutor to demonstrate familiarity with the theory they are critiquing. Butler is brilliant, but also difficult to just open up. The point is that you want to keep the focus on the topic at hand. 2) you might inquire why dichotomies are so integral to thought. Does someone become less transgender just because someone invokes a dichotomy? What's more does someone become less a person, with self and sexuality and gender and intellect and soul and skin, just by using the word male? Human beings are complex, and the need to distinguish them so simply seems to be nothing more than an insecurity. Again, the point is that if someone wants to rebut your argument, they should demonstrate relevance and engagement with your argument. Otherwise their rebuttal should not convince you. Like math problems on tests, showing your work is what earns you credit, not an answer alone. Why? Because an answer is a claim requiring an argument. 3) who decides what properties a chair actually has? Chairs don't. If I make a chair by sitting on a rock, then what? To use a classic example, Plato received grand applause in the academy for defining man as a featherless biped. His definition appeared so precise and representative of the essence of man... Until the following day when Diogenes declared ""Behold man"" while gesturing to a recently defeathered chicken clucking before the agitated thinkers. Just because you read the definition of a chair, or defined chair, doesn't mean you understand a chair. Nor does it mean that you have forestalled the future, new ideas and example, nor counterarguments. The discourse doesn't end with a definition, nor a category. So, why does gender and sexuality end with some textbook that made an argument? 4) if you feel comfortable, ask them to explain woman and man. If it is just a penis and vagina explanation, then you can quickly rebut that your gender and sexuality are nothing more than the objects of reproduction. What good is that? If man is a body type, then that person's identity is nothing more than their muscularity. Drawing out those implications may be useful to show why it is important to consider gender theory more closely. 5) ask them why they stopped listening. This may reveal bias, fear, personal matters, or something else. Maybe these discussions are more about helping each other than demolishing arguments. 



Yeah. I'm happy to see Marxists dealing with criticism. 



It is useful to ask people to explain themselves rather than their arguments sometimes. I think that arguments like epistemic nihilism or moral nihilism represent more of a fear for the person than a real threat... Unless they have some damn good evidence. 

Those nihilisms are complicated, and I think rely on some dialogic defining. I think moral nihlism qua universal moralities can be feared because people want to believe they are playing by the same rules as others. I think the simplicity of there be one true idea of justice we all work with is more attractive than having to argue about justice and deal with alterity. But, the latter seems more real to me. I think there may be a blindspot here for many people's ethics in trying to understand their morality and judgements with rape or murder or other problems. Murder is not so simple for example. What if I kill someone in self-defense? What if, like Augustine, you argue the just war doctrine so you can justify the murders of war? As Nietzsche points out, we are beyond good and evil. That sort of simple bifold distinction through a quick deduction or induction is too shaky. If something will  be morally good, it shouldn't be because the mayor said so, but perhaps because you thought about the matter and made the judgement realizing that you could be wrong. There may not be a signpost or a granite tablet dictating unquestionable moralities to abide by, and that may be prefferable."

Poststructuralism,fdad8q5,t1_fd9yp9g,1578244752.0,"Well, it really depends on the critic in question. For Hicks, poststructuralism seems to have killed the enlightenment and prevented human beings from being at the epitomy of powers of reason and such. Nostalgia for a time never lived in... You actually might find Baudrillard interesting for his views on noatalgia vis-a-vis the real and simulation. At another level, signs are changing and self-reflexivity happening. Complexities have become a hallmark of contemporary times, and poststructuralism embraces the complex while remaining complex. One cannot open up Anti-Oedipus on a whim like one can Das Capital vol. 1. It still might be fun to do so, but the former work is dealing with so much more than outlining capitalist production with dialectical materialism; you may not need to much Hegel to read Marx, yet how much Freud is necessary just to broach some of the ideas of Deleuze and Gurattari? 

At another level, poststructuralism is critical theory. Kant may seem normal today, but him critiquing reason during the Enlightenment probably didn't earn him immediate support just like Sartre's short critique of Husserl annoys Husserilans. In some sense, this situation is sort of like the heliocentric and geocentric models. Both existed before Ptolemy and Copernicus, yet the Ptolemaic took preponderance. Its fracturing was resisted for more than simple religious reasons. The challenge of that model extended to powers connected with that knowledge, beyond a political visibility and with epistemic structures. In another sense, Einstein provided a face for a similar movement with relativity and other theories. Classical or Newtonian mechanics had begun to give way along with people relying on it. Still, consider Nietzsche, a forebear and progenator of poststructuralism for some. His criticisms made him a boogeyman far beyond Marx. Rick Roderick humorously points out that Marxism has become acceptance in the US after its persecution, scholars can dissert on Marx and write for Marxist journals, or even be in Marxist organizations. But, to be Nieztschean is still met with great taboo. As an anecdote, I was listening to NPR a few years ago. They were running a story on a young person who was 3d printing guns and had open sourced the schematics. NPR suggested that young person had the sort of attitude of someone sort of dangerous who spends their time reading Nietzsche. The point is not the gunprinter,but that an NPR correspondent used Nietzsche as a way of establishing a sort of megalomania or instability ethos. Poststructuralists like Foucault share in this sort of attack, especially when they focus on power. For Peterson, this is a sort of self-deceiving fantasy centered in ressentement... But, that argument does not hold in light of Foucault and Nietzsche's work and instead serves as another bait and switch. If you watch Chomsky and Foucault's debate, I think you can see some of the challenges just in communication. Foucault has no problem discussing Chomsky's work, but Chomsky never discusses Foucault's. Foucault critiques Chomsky's invocation of justice in context of a power struggle that Chomsky hasn't considered. For Chomsky, Foucault is attacking a moral fabric. But, Foucault is not discarding the idea of justice, but pointing out that Chomsky does not have much ground to stand on with his appeal of justice. Instead, Foucault suggests a criticism would be more impacting, but Chomsky takes the meaning differently. Maybe he has a point, but he is missing Foucault's point, which is my previous point. Poststructuralism's challenge is often dismissed as a moral nihilism, moral relativism, epistemic demolition, or whatever because for many in the audience: they feel morality or knowledge or whatever else is being demolished. In a way, this is the Socratic trial all over again with new thinkers being on trial for rejecting the gods and corrupting the youth. 
The simple answer to your question is a common tactic for dealing with challenging things is to ignore them. Or, attack them. Engaging poststructuralism requires meeting those arguments where they are at. For many, Derridian différance seems too daunting. If one considers that the meaning of words, or signifiers, is always defered and part of a network of different signifiers is to be trapped in a labyrinth expecting a minotaur. Again, poststructuralism challenges notions many people may not be immediately aware of. Or, maybe they only see the corners of because they are underneath its far-reaching blanket as Greg Salyer likes to suggest. As Nietzsche suggests, what if we consider our value of reason to be an invention and part of animalistic self-importance that even a mosquito has? Criticism can be the most frightening challenge of all; Socrates is in one sense sentenced to death for his criticisms corruption of the youth. Maybe that episteme remains. More precisely, maybe the fear of engagement providing credence, or power structures, is too much for people because they feel the stakes are so high. In the US, I often hear it that debates are really a matter of opinion that both sides are entitled to so bygones should be bygones. There is no engaging mutual critique and dialogue when all we have are two opinions that are mutually adversarial. But, neither side needs to best the other: they only need to keep their side intact by reinforcing the adversarial relationship. One needs something to fight against. I think poststructuralism is trying to do something different. Foucault once remarked that he understands the temptation to criticize this new movement for large dismantling without yet putting things back together. Part of the poststructuralist point as I see it is that there aren't going to be those immediate answers. Aristotelian categories may not be all they are cracked up to be, which is okay. Maybe we can do better having learned through critique of them. Maybe things have changed since Aristotle. As Foucault quips, ""what new games shall we play?"".

Now, I think there are some who can engage poststructuralism fairly. PostMarxism is one trend of Marxism that deals with poststructuralist by reassessing the central points of some theory. 

When I say those arguments say more about themselves than what they critique, I mean that the dismissal of poststructuralism can tell us more about the dismissal than poststructuralism. In my previous points, I highlighted a fear of moral nihilism. Understanding why this fear arises may be useful for encouraging a more meaningful dialogue.

I haven' t read the Habermas-Foucault debates, but I believe the project is Foucault's geneology in contradistinction to Habermas' communicative rationality. Part of the trouble with poststructuralists and postmodernist is that these distinctions include multivarious thinkers. For example, isn't Habermas postmodern by virtue of his time period? Indeed, the definitions matter quite a bit here. If Habermas wants to end modernism, he may be a postmodernist yet he certainly does not share the same trajectory as Foucault.  

I'm not familiar with Pagila, but that is my point. These critiques can lose sight of the point: understanding poststructuralism or postmodernism in order to critique it. Arguing Foucault's profession as a scholar is why he wrote his work is not only unfair to Foucault but also suggests a bias. This argument prevents us from engaging with poststructuralism. It is not impervious to criticism, but criticism has to be fair and knowledgeable for it to have an integrity to be evaluatable."
Poststructuralism,fd9waec,t3_eke4gf,1578238757.0,"I don't have an immediate answer, but it may arrive with visiting the early postructuralist texts and their responses. For example, Derrida's ""Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences"" introduces free play and the idea of non-centrality for concepts like ""man"". I think the temptation is the resistance to that sort of fluidity, or self-reflexivity, which poses a threat to matters that maybe were implicitly ""settled"". The challenge of poststructuralism comes with reevaluation, or reexamining those neglected margins. 

I think this challenge contributes to some of the attacks on poststructuralism as illogical. Those arguments may say more about the positions they arise from as opposed to poststructuralism as it is. In one sense, Habermas is sort of noteworthy because he doesn't try to bait and switch or ad hominem poststructuralism (viz. Foucaulvian geneology), but attempts to argue it begins with contradictions. The point being that poststructuralism does not have a reputation for fair treatment."

I can critique any argument for fascism he may present if ever, but his metaphysics doesn't necessarily argue for fascism. Karl Marx may be anti-semitic or racist. But, I don't think his critique of capitalism broaches racial prejudice. To really get at it, we would have to get those texts out and look at what's going on, which may prove interesting."

I don't know if he is a racist, but I don't think that immediately matters for his work. Pynchon's point is that Marx's hard economic analysis doesn't actually capture the allure of colonialism. In perhaps a more Weberian sense, there is a spirit interested in a sort of Dorian Gray duplicity. Reading Marx doesn't mean you need to agree with every point, but it does provide some interesting critical points about capitalism. To a less explicit point, not everything has to be understood from Marx's standpoint, or for the sake of the closed teeth of Marx, from the standpoint of Marxism.

I think one should read Marx and observe any prejudices. Nevertheless, Marx may provide the reader with intriguing ideas as well. The point is to read him for yourself and think about the texts and arguments."

So, let me make a few additional suggestions. Confucius and Mencius also wrote on virtue ethics. The latter has an eponymous text and the former the Analects. Additionally, texts like the Dao de Jing are interested in virtue as well. I find that virtues are commented on often implicitly, especially alongside values. 

Secondly, after reading the Greeks and Romans, I suggest you read Nietzsche's geneology of morality. This recommendation may seem uncouth, but the author provides some insightful critiques of the morality you've been reading about. Further, virtue is actually a concern for Nieztsche though he takes it elsewhere from the Greeks and Romans while also critiquing the Christian, and in some sense anticipating the Victorian notion, of virtue as well. 

Finally, don't be afraid to read some poetry. Whitman's Song of the Open Road or even Goethe's Faust may be of interest to you."

Nietzsche,fcurrnn,t1_fctpuul,1577987173.0,"Interesting argument and deployment of Spinoza. I like it.

Yet, I wish to propose a counter-interpretation. It seems like Nietzsche is suggesting that the recognition of good and evil, or the judging of phenomena and values, is made not by some objective criteria or some analysis, like in utilitarianism, but more like a reflex or intuition through a consideration of judgements and attached parabols.  As I read this quote, it is more comparable with Socrates and Euthyphro questioning the source and desirability of the good. While we may wonder if the gods choose what is good or participate in what is good, Zarathustra instead suggests a more subtle point.  What if the question is not about the reality of the gods, or an objective or universal morality? What if our language, more precisely: the words we use to to express judgements and evaluations of good and evil are instead connected to parables, to didactic muthos and stories. If this is the case, we may not be able to evince good and evil with arguments, but stories. That is to say, morality arises from an observing of experiences and judgements. For example, the Bentham maxim, ""the greatest good for the greatest number"" may not be a proposition so much as a didactic from a story. In the same way, our evaluations may reveal ideas and stories that we are not necessarily trying to evoke, yet an invocation appears performed. 

I believe Zarathustra may therefore be suggesting that when we evaluate and indicate good and evil attributes, we consider why we are doing so. The story may not be a trouble, yet if we are living our lives through those overarching stories, living the trials of Hercules for example, then are we truly living as ourselves? Stories appear pedagogical with moral lessons, yet the warning appears to be in taking the opportunity for wisdom as a mountain rather than a bridge. The metaphors of these stories provide hints of moralities. To Zarathustra's point, it is when we find these stories' efflux from ourselves that we find hints of our own moralities. Virtue is therefore more of an evaluation of didactics and deliberation of these ideas in line with the role of personal choice. It may well be that the didactic is ill-suited to the experience, and one finds virtue, or moral strength, in choosing elsewise, perhaps producing a new story... Sort of like Thus Spoke Zarathustra, if you will. Indeed, we may then find that words like virtue may no longer be appropriate or require redefinition, or prophets speaking new stories within stories."
