I don't think that it's a waste of money, whether you give $5 or a thousand. To you it may seem *inefficient* but you make it seem like God powers don't exist. He can take 2 fishes and 5 loaves and feed 5000, make sure you don't forget that."

I'm not worried if this months bills are going to ruin me (always a possibility) but I have the safety and security of knowing that God is in control. He knows me, loves me, and is with me even in the lowest times. We aren't promised tomorrow, but we are promised to be filled by the love of Christ. And for *that* I'm eternally grateful."

todayilearned,fcix5lb,t1_fcivfsm,1577671940.0,"You haven't finished the verse so I'll finish it for you. 
Jesus' said ""I come not to abolish the law, but to fulfill them"" or to accomplish their purpose. 

Jesus was saying that the law was made for a people (Jews) that were supposed to be set apart from everyone else and elevated. That if they could fulfill the law in all of its entirety, they would be perfect and blameless. The old testament is filled with stories of mighty men that failed over and over and over. Jesus had to be born to live the life that no one could live."
todayilearned,fciwsja,t1_fciv4pi,1577671691.0,How do you consider good to be? You cant know what is a crooked line without first seeing a straight line.
todayilearned,fciwnl5,t1_fciuxr8,1577671597.0,"True Christianity is following Christ. If you disagree with Christ, you cannot be a Christian. I don't believe any of the things you said. I know we are going through a climate crisis, and I'm not focused on the rapture. There is no verse in the Bible that says my life should or will be comfortable. In fact, it says differently. I am focused on loving everyone around me and trying to put your needs above my own. I don't believe in a wall, I don't believe our president is fit to be president, but never the less he was elected. 

Christianity cannot be written off as absolutely wrong, just as I cannot prove to you that it it absolutely right (other than what has happened in my life). So there will always be a sort of ambiguity there. It requires deep reflection and deep thought to know if it's there. Also, if you are sincere, God will reveal himself to you. All you have to do is ask, and be willing to receive."

todayilearned,fciszuf,t1_fcir9yg,1577669090.0,"You could define many things as a cult. Trump followers, sportsfans, anyone attempting to win the lottery to make themselves rich. All these are examples of worship. We were made to worship.

 Modern day definitions of cults tends to be small, and Christianity is very widespread. Cults have a negative connotation, and I believe true Christianity to be very very positive and something that is amazingly rewarding."
todayilearned,fcis0v6,t1_fciqib5,1577668445.0,"The evidence of Jesus and his works are astounding. We have more manuscripts and copies of manuscripts and copies of copies than of literally any event in history. By a very long shot. By exponentially more than say the illiad, or of any of ancient Greece or Rome. To say that that wasn't reason to invest any credence to the Bible would be kind of strange. 

Google the video ""Rabbit or man"" by Cs Lewis. He was a very smart man and a strong thinker and famous philosopher. Contrary to what people think about Christianity, it's not about religion, it's about a relationship. There is no indoctrination. I encourage you to use your brain to work it out. But don't discredit yourself by saying that you have figured it all out."
todayilearned,fcip2oy,t1_fchzwim,1577666472.0,"Hey, I see you are quoting out of Leviticus (a text written for Jewish people only) in a time frame that neither had common currency nor a credit system to settle debt. Most commonly when you owed someone a debt you couldn't pay, you either went to a debtors prison, were forgiven the debt, or offered yourself as a slave."
todayilearned,fciookc,t1_fci06yw,1577666243.0,"It's capable of creating a barrier of self denial as well. The difference between Christianity and a cult, is that Jesus always let the one who didn't want to believe walk away. He never chased anyone. He never begged or pleaded with any individual person. He presents the truth, that you are a broken person, and that you are not right with God. He offers the way to amnesty with God freely as a gift. You don't have to drink blood or scarify yourself. Just have to believe it. It's really that simple. You don't even have to believe it to go to church. You can just be curious as to what this whole Jesus thing is all about. Just show up. They won't kick you out or pressure you or talk about you. Just sit there while they sing and listen to what they have to say. 

Or from the comfort of your own home you can check out youtube episodes of my strange Bible here https://youtu.be/LVVtyvvRAGc or watch the philosophy of famous atheist turned Christian CS. Lewis."
todayilearned,fcinsic,t1_fcijprm,1577665716.0,"How do you pay someone back for something if you have no money in a timeframe that didn't have common currency or a credit system? 

There were things created by man called debtors prison. Or sometimes you offered yourself as a slave instead. This was an institution created and implemented by man."
todayilearned,fcinik4,t1_fcibipu,1577665552.0,"That's a super common misconception. I don't do good because I'm afraid of what could happen if I dont. I do good because I love the one that loves me first. I love for the sake of the one who loved me. 

Which employee would you give a raise to: the one who did the bare minimum of his job description because he was afraid of being fired? Or the one who worked for the employer to the best of his ability because he loved his job?"
todayilearned,fcimxsm,t1_fci0kss,1577665255.0,"To make it clear, I behave the way I do out of love for my Creator. Much like a husband would behave to his wife because he loves her,  not because he was afraid of divorce. 

Morality is a tricky thing. You could claim to be moral, but by whose standards? By society's standards? They change all the time. There was a point that it was acceptable to own a slave or marry a 12 year old. Those aren't moral now. You cant claim morality on your own terms because your definition could (and most certainly would) be vastly different from mine. So you must borrow from other worldviews to create your morality.

Edit: a letter"
todayilearned,fcilba5,t1_fci6zy5,1577664478.0,"If they ignore Christ, they aren't Christian by definition. 
Also Christ can't be a good teacher because he claimed to be God. That would make him a lunatic and a liar. You cant claim one without the other. He is either a liar, a lunatic, or God."
