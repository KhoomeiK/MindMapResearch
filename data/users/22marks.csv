Fitness,ffplk4w,t1_ffph2tr,1580098048.0,"It depends on your age. General rule of thumb is ""220 minus your age"" is your maximum heart rate (e.g. If you're 30, it's 190bpm.)  Moderate exercise is 50-70% of your maximum. Vigorous is 70% to 85%. Of course, these are rough ranges and you should take any possible medical concerns into account first.  


Typically, the more fit you are, the less your heart will need to increase. Another great gauge is how quickly your heart rate recovers. You can find out what's considered good 1 minute or 2 minutes after exercising.  


If you want to get even more technical, you can look into HRV (heart rate variability). The Apple Watch tracks this and there are apps to monitor it. The higher the HRV, the better. If you're overtraining, your HRV can drop.  


All of this is basically about making sure you're exercising optimally and not overtraining. It's quite possible you would be better off going longer, but slower. Maybe talk to your doctor at your next physical and see what they think?"

I get that it's to stop luxury cars from benefitting but the number they picked was $55,000.

StarWarsLeaks,feg1hms,t1_fefyfj0,1579072887.0,"That's a fair assessment.  


I think the big difference with Vader's conflict is that we can all understand the bond between a parent and child. It's basically a law of nature, at least in films like this. That's the reason the Vader/Father reveal was so shocking and dramatic. So, a last-minute switch of a father saving his son works. 

I understand they're both lost souls and Rey wants to see the Ben in Kylo. I don't think Rey's disappointing week with Luke can be compared to Snoke completely manipulating and wearing down Kylo for years. I'm also having a hard time bridging that gap between wanting to help save a tortured soul (which is admirable) being equal to love or romance.  


Their backgrounds are so different, it's not like they can even find common ground.  Kylo Ren was born as basically royalty, knowing he's the son of Leia and Han, trained with the most powerful Jedi (his own uncle). He knows his place in this story. He's part of the battle for control of the galaxy. There was a falling out and he became the target of a malevolent force that used him to become the most feared leader in the galaxy.  Rey has a childlike innocence, barely making ends meet as a scavenger waiting for her family when she's suddenly swept up in a battle for the galaxy. They were both ""isolated"" but in such different manners that it feels wrong using the same word to describe them.  


It's not that I think the people interpreting it as such are wrong. It's all good. I'm just curious how half(?) of the fans are watching the same films and getting different vibes."

>Because she’s one of the people trying to reach Ben Solo... same as his mother and father who he *also* loves....  


I get this is a space fantasy, but didn't they know each other for only a few days? RoS happens a little later, but it doesn't seem like they had any meaningful interactions between the films. Half of that time it was as adversaries, with Rey watching Kylo kill his father and attack her new friends or him telling her she was a nobody? I mean, they had a ""connection"" (certainly a ""Force Connection"" later revealed to be a dyad) or chemistry, but... *love*? 

Even for a space opera, I'm just not seeing time put in for real relationship development. Kylo/Ben may have seen someone trying to reach Ben, but where exactly was Rey doing this? And what did Kylo do to make Rey love him back? Or at least think of him romantically?

I know I'm not seeing something that a lot of people are seeing between them. I'm not dismissing that. But where and how did Rey see Ben? That one time in the hut when fingers touched was probably the main one? Are we supposed to believe that's the instant love happening? 

To be fair, I think RoS did a very good job of showing Kylo die and become reborn as Ben. I just don't see where the thought of a relationship (even a simple friendship) could even enter before *that* point. It's not like Rey knew Ben before. RoS makes it clear a Ben and Rey could've had a chance at love. I supposed that's what Reylos are looking at?

With all that frunk space freed up, imagine this applied to the front in addition to the sides. For that level of external airbags, it would need to work in conjunction with a sensor suite because they need to deploy before impact, so it's a hybrid of sorts. I think the system you're referring to deploys around the windshield after impact.

The statistically significant life/injury savings from this point on are going to be disproportionately going into avoidance. I'm sure the testing numbers will start to show that.

I absolutely loved the Model S and I thought I’d miss the IC, but now I prefer not having one. Going back to the Model S felt like a glowing cell phone in a movie theater. I love having nothing in my forward line of sight, particularly at night. It’s a cleaner, more open view. And I feel like it’s more comfortable looking to the horizontal center screen with peripheral vision than glancing down at the IC or the vertical screen. The symmetry of the cabin also feels better to me. 

It’s like the dedicated AP stalk on the Model S. I initially missed it, but now it just feels effortless using the shifter. One click down from drive, cruise control turns on. Two clicks auto-steer, turns on. It just makes sense. 

Personally, I think the IC is a throwback to when we needed to see RPMs. But, in my opinion, it’s destined to become the floppy disk of the car world. At best, we might see a tiny 1” display with speed and navigation, more akin to HUD displays. If you really think about it, the location isn’t even great. Arms, hands, and pieces of steering wheel are blocking it when turning. Again, it never bothered me before, but after the Model 3, I started noticing the issues. Up until then, there was simply no alternative. I get that it happens to be cheaper, too, but I’d prefer it if it cost more.

It was really only after going back and forth between the two that the Model 3 setup grew on me. My wife never understood why I loved the Model S so much. Now she’s always asking to borrow the Model 3. She sends random texts like “I love this car.” She, too, prefers the display setup of the Model 3.

One of my first Model S referrals just “upgraded” to a Model 3 and likes display more as well. I get that it’s a polarizing opinion, but I thought sharing a point of view from some people who lived with both might be interesting."

So, I think someone was clever. They took one video of the man and extended the ending (e.g. duplicated frames) to make him pause. Then, they cut right where the bug from another video was in position and dropped that into the timeline of their editing software. It was probably the previous or next video, so the lighting and all the branches remained the same.

EDIT: Go full screen and watch the brick wall until the man pauses at \~5.6 seconds. Note all the compression artifacts suddenly freeze, indicating a frame duplication.

todayilearned,fd7b8nc,t1_fd3dlx8,1578201865.0,"There's a lot to address in that article, so I apologize for the length of this response. I want to be thorough for posterity.

I have no reason to doubt any of the studies linked, as much of this is scientific consensus at this point. The article starts out strong in this matter, emphasising the importance of early language access and preventing language deprivation. This is incredibly important to me and I couldn't agree more.

I'm also in agreement that learning a second language (including ASL) doesn't appear to be detrimental to developing language. So, everything is still good.

However, the research doesn't support the author's hypothesis that: ""The truth is, if a Deaf child or Hard of Hearing child does not have access to ASL they are likely experiencing some level of language deprivation.""

The decision to use ASL is complex and individual. I advocate for an evidence-based discussion on incorporating ASL in consultation with the child's caretakers. Certainly, the more severe the hearing loss, the higher the likelihood ASL will be beneficial. Part of the problem is that ""full access"" is an abstract term. Someone with a 5db loss can't hear well in a loud bar, while ASL would allow for effortless communication. Someone with ASL can't converse with a passenger in a car while driving. There are situations where neither will work. Nothing is ""full access."" There's no perfect solution for everyone.

The author notes: ""The research is showing us that *hearing aids* and cochlear implants, when used alone (i.e., without the support of ASL) do not give sufficient access to language to prevent language deprivation in Deaf and Hard of Hearing children."" However, the only research paper linked within the main article supporting this is specifically addressed toward cochlear implants only. Not, for example, a mild or moderate hearing loss that is properly aided. 

I'll break down that paragraph:

> Despite ample research to show that ASL is a formal language with its own grammar and linguistic rules, less than 8% of Deaf children receive regular access to sign language in the home (Liddel, SK, 2003; Institute, G.R., 2011). Although using ASL is encouraged for hearing babies to develop language skills before they can begin to speak, ASL is not routinely offered as a primary or complementary intervention for Deaf children; rather, if offered at all, it is often proposed as a last-resort option to Deaf children who have not developed speech abilities as expected (Humphries, T. et al 2012). This pattern occurs because many advocates, professionals, and educators believe that ASL acquisition will interfere with a Deaf child’s development of speech skills (Lyness, C. et al 2013; Sugar, M. 2016; Davidson, et al 2011; Duchesne et al. 2009; Lund 2015; Tobey at al, 2011) despite research showing that children with cochlear implants who use ASL actually demonstrate better speech skills, language development and intelligence scores than non-signing children (Davidson, et all 2011; Hassanzadeh, S. 2012; Amraeri, K. 2016). Based on current research, technological intervention alone (i.e., hearing aids, cochlear implants) are insufficient as a stand-alone approach for language acquisition in Deaf children (Humphries et al 2012b; Kral et al 2016). The research is showing us that hearing aids and cochlear implants, when used alone (i.e., without the support of ASL) do not give sufficient access to language to prevent language deprivation in Deaf and Hard of Hearing children.

Most of this is fine, but where exactly is the research that *hearing aids*, when appropriate for the individual, are causing language deprivation without also using ASL? It's not in any of the studies in that paragraph or the dozens of studies in the reference list at the end. It's a peeve of mine to blast a lot of studies and use them to pivot to a personal statement (or a best, one without the same level of supporting evidence). To a causal reader, one might assume many of those studies are backing the concept. One of the more passionate papers about linguistic neglect [Source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311215976_Avoiding_Linguistic_Neglect_of_Deaf_Children) doesn't even contain the words ""hearing aids"" in it.

The author lists 39 articles in the Reference section. 11 of the articles are about ""unilateral hearing loss,"" particularly the effects of unaided unilateral hearing loss. 12 are about ""cochlear implant"" outcomes. So, none of those are related to hearing aids. 

The remaining 16 reference articles are as follows and I added direct links to them with quick notes at the end:

To be honest, I find it disingenuous to fill a paper with references to research and then state ""*The research is showing us* that *hearing aids* and cochlear implants, when used alone (i.e., without the support of ASL) do not give sufficient access to language to prevent language deprivation in Deaf and Hard of Hearing children."" Yet, they fail to provide any of this research in the copious list of external papers. It makes one wonder... why? 

If I was going to take an approach at this argument, I'd say ""Okay, evidence demonstrates a second language doesn't hurt. So why not cover all bases and just teach both?"" My counter to that would be time versus benefit. Why not also learn Spanish and Chinese? Why not Signed English instead of ASL so you only need to teach one grammatical construct? At a certain point, we all need to make a decision on where we spend our time. Do we teach the entire family and siblings ASL for an aided mild hearing loss? Or do we use that time for math or reading? There's no ""right"" answer. Just a lot of different good ones.

Most children who are deaf or hard of hearing are born to hearing parents. It's an incredibly difficult time with a newborn, trying to ingest a lot of information. For that reason, it's really important to me that the decision making process is guided by scientific evidence."
todayilearned,fd35mun,t1_fd0or7b,1578154953.0,"Just to be clear, I’m not involved with LENA. My son just happened to use it. 

Most people can’t access spoken language 100%. We’re filling in gaps all the time, independent of hearing levels. I was just discussing it with the audiologist this past week about it. My son got a 96% with background noise and she said having even 90% word recognition would still be considered typical. The world is filled with distractions for everyone. Think about a noisy restaurant or a bar/club.

ASL certainly solves one problem with spoken words but does introduce others. Nothing is perfect. The fact is, you can miss words when someone isn’t looking, like when driving or riding a bike. Or if the lighting is bad. It’s comparable to being in a noisy environment, but just in a different way. It also greatly reduces the number of people who speak it (which can limit social and work opportunities). So, it’s not fair to say 100% accessible in a comparison. 

Many children with aids are excelling in public schools. With today’s wearable FM systems and 504 plans helping keep noise down or giving priority seating, there’s no reason they can’t have excellent access to sound.

All that said, I believe choice is key and I’m glad you found a way that works for you. But I respectfully disagree that every child, even with a mild loss, needs ASL to have a 100% accessible language. My son, for example, has a moderate loss and is more social and having an easier time in school than my daughter who doesn’t have hearing loss.

Again, thank you for sharing your experiences."
todayilearned,fd0mix8,t1_fd0i2ir,1578120898.0,"I’m truly sorry you had that experience. I think you bring up an extremely important point. We (society, audiologists, parents) really need to make sure we’re helping the whole person and not just amplifying frequencies. As you’ve noted, there are psychological aspects that could be influencing test results and outcomes. There should’ve been a better support system to help with embarrassment or social anxiety. 

My son is still very young, so I’m taking your comments to heart and perhaps they’ll help him and others. I truly appreciate you sharing them. And I hope you found a better audiologist who knows how to randomize word lists and properly use background noise. The list thing is a big deal because you probably have a superior audiological memory from filling in blanks and compensating all that time. You’d think that would be higher on their radar."
todayilearned,fd0fha9,t1_fd0am40,1578118050.0,"That’s a good question. The LENA measures word count that reaches the microphone. Then you’d have to apply the number given by your audiologist after a test in the booth. I believe LENA was originally developed for autism and the study of child language acquisition, so it’s not solely for hearing loss. 

What makes you think your 95% isn’t accurate? My son just had his test and they did a list of ~50 random words to come up with his score (while aided). Then they repeated it with another list of words with simulated background noise. This was after the standard pure tone audiometry used to program his audiogram into the aids. It seemed pretty thorough. 

Did you tell the audiologist you thought your number was off?"
todayilearned,fd01nyz,t1_fczvwhp,1578112314.0,"It I remember correctly, we'd occasionally hit around 18,000. Keep in mind, this is with two adults and a Teacher of the Deaf. And it would also count, for example, my wife and I speaking to one another or to a sibling. Or if we were on the phone. But there was a *lot* of narrating going on in the first years. So much so that our son is now highly talkative and tends to go overboard on descriptions."
todayilearned,fczmlk6,t3_ejmgk4,1578104522.0,"This is interesting as my son was born with hearing loss. It's vitally important to get aided within the first three months of life. Manual and vocal babbling peaks between 6 and 9 months, which also shows how quickly those young brains are absorbing communication around them. The neuroplasticity of the brain for developing language is optimal for about three years. Studies have demonstrated that children need to hear a good 20,000 adult words per day to reach their full potential. It makes sense when you consider how much emhapsis they put on reading to children. They need to hear words directed at them and incidentally (overhearing conversations).

We used a system called LENA, which looks like a little MP3 player that goes into a pocket in the front of a special t-shirt. It recorded every word my son was hearing even before he was babbling. Then, it would generate reports on how many adult words he was hearing per day, including when there was background noise (like television or car rides). And then it would also report his babbling back (e.g. ""conversational turns""). It was fascinating to have an *objective* tool to monitor his language acquisition progress in real-time.
