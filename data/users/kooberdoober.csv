edit: maybe i should clarify: mr. sanchez is correct, nothing regarding weinsteins supposed disability could be entered as evidence. but when addressing the jury (whom mr weinstein is trying to influence with his pity show) the prosecutor could call him out during opening and closing statements. i expect the average da would not, but you never know, because sexual crimes are so emotionally charged. attorneys dont like emotions. heh."

Looks like this comment might be misunderstood: I understand people take hormones for a number of reasons. Birth control included. The normalization and social pressure is what's weird to me.

does that bother you? whats your problem? I don't fucking understand. Get a life. If he is elected to public office based on this comment, ya might have a reason to care.
