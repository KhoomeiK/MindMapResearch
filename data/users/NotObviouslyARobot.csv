They came to him and said, “Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity. You aren’t swayed by others, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay the imperial tax to Caesar or not?  Should we pay or shouldn’t we?”

For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’ 

 Jesus himself states that helping and uplifting the alien, the poor, the downtrodden, and the criminal are not optional for those who would call him Lord.  If you're not a follower of Jesus Christ, do whatever the hell you want.  Otherwise, you're an unfaithful servant"
