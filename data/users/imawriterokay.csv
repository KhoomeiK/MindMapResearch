AskReddit,ffh4jpj,t3_ethuyz,1579922924.0,"You gotta understand cat body language so you’re sending the right signals and interpreting their signals correctly. Anyone who charges at a cat, arms out, yelling “KITTY!” will only be able to watch sadly as the cat runs for its life. 

Keep your posture loose and relaxed, and avoid facing the cat head-on. Crouching is good. Look at the cat’s body, or at the ground near the cat, but don’t hold eye contact. (Cats make themselves look big and glare intently to intimidate each other; you want to be as unintimidating as possible.) Speak softly and reassuringly. Hold out a hand (again, keep it relaxed) and let the cat come to you if it’s ready. 

If the cat is squishing itself to the ground or wall, or running away, don’t push it. It’s telling you it doesn’t feel safe around you yet and you need to respect that boundary to earn it’s trust. Sit nearby, continue speaking gently to it, and wait. Try using food as motivation, especially if it’s a stray and probably hungry. (Note: this isn’t likely to work for ferals. The fear of humans is just too ingrained.)"

AskReddit,ffeugv1,t3_et8lo5,1579866057.0,"This happened on a family camping trip when I was a kid. I wanted to go for a bike ride with two of my siblings. For some reason I ended up borrowing my momâ€™s bike, which had a child seat mounted on the back. Apparently, somehow the child seat was broken in transit, and a chunk of plastic was hanging loose. 

I set out with my siblings, picking up speed as we glided downhill. Suddenly the back tire of the bike started bouncing violently, and I was thrown over the handlebars. I vividly remember getting a close-up look at the pavement and thinking, â€œthis is going to hurt.â€ 

I landed on my head, and my body kind of folded in half around the bike. In my memory, thereâ€™s no sound at all, but Iâ€™m told I screamed - it was a totally visceral and subconscious response. Between the scream and the loud crash I brought parents running from every nearby campsite. 

I laid there for a few moments, checking that all limbs were present and functional, then very carefully disentangled myself from the bike and sat up. I saw my mom charging down the hill towards me, and the look on her face is burned into my brain. 

Fortunately, I was wearing my helmet. I walked away from a crash that couldâ€™ve killed me with some bruises, scrapes, and road rash. Wear your helmets, people! ðŸš´ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸"

You are doing so, so well. Youâ€™ve accomplished so much to be proud of. Feeling sad - or not feeling happy - does not negate that! 

You mentioned being on meds for two years. Are those for your mental health? Because this sounds like a perfect description of depression, although you didnâ€™t actually say that. 

If not: find yourself a mental health professional. Tell them what you told us. Try some meds if theyâ€™re recommended, and try therapy. 

If they are: go back to your mental health professional and tell them *it isnâ€™t working.* My first suicidal episode came because I thought my quality of life was as good as it was gonna get, and it wasnâ€™t good enough. That was not true. My meds needed adjusted and I needed more therapy, but Iâ€™m now functional- and capable of feeling emotion! - probably 85% of the time. You deserve that, too! Tell your doctor that your current treatment isnâ€™t working well enough and you want to try changing it. Please.

MomForAMinute,fdw2j0w,t3_en6y3s,1578754364.0,"Sweetheart, let me reassure you that this was NOT YOUR FAULT. It just wasnâ€™t. Your friend had an illness, and the illness is what killed him. You are not to blame.

Strange as it sounds, feeling that way - that it was your fault - is a defense mechanism. Our minds donâ€™t like uncertainty; it makes us feel unsafe. So our minds donâ€™t like to believe that sometimes bad things just happen, and they arenâ€™t anyoneâ€™s fault, and they arenâ€™t always preventable. Instead, they convince us that there WAS something we could have done, because that means we have the power to stop things like that from happening again. So we latch on to the little things - â€œI should have gone with him to the dance, I should have answered the phone, I should have...â€- and convince ourselves that we could have prevented the bad thing if we done this or that differently. It just isnâ€™t true. 

At 20, you can probably recognize that you were still essentially a child when this happened. Medical professionals who have years of schooling and experience with mental illness can still miss the signs of depression and suicidal thoughts. Even if they are in contact with a suicidal person in that moment, they canâ€™t always keep them from losing that fight. No one can reasonably expect a kid to do better. 

I strongly recommend that you seek therapy, if you can. Honestly, I think therapy is amazing and everyone can benefit from it. Youâ€™ve been carrying this trauma and guilt for so long, and you donâ€™t need to. A therapist can help you to set it down. 

If you take nothing else from my comment, remember this: you do not deserve to carry the blame for your friendâ€™s illness or his suicide. Your brain was trying to protect you, but it was wrong. You can let that weight go now. Your friend would want that for you ðŸ’•"

Advice,fcqh0zp,t3_eib5jr,1577885847.0,"This kind of controlling behavior is extremely inappropriate at your age and borderline emotionally abusive. If it were your boyfriend acting like this, I would encourage you to leave him. I know the situation is complicated by your dadâ€™s health, but you need to at least be aware that that behavior is toxic and not okay.

Feeling awful and guilty when sheâ€™s mad at you - *she has trained you to feel that way.* She wants you to do as she says, to allow her to control your life, and sheâ€™s using feelings of guilt to manipulate you. Donâ€™t let her. You have no legitimate reason for guilt. There is absolutely nothing wrong with an adult making her own choices and going to see her boyfriend occasionally. 

Since you canâ€™t leave, what you need is some firm boundaries. Establishing those is gonna be really, really hard. Your mom will NOT like it, because sheâ€™s used to controlling you and you are taking that control back. 

Iâ€™d start with some really simple ground rules. 
- If sheâ€™s upset about something, she needs to communicate with you as an adult - with her words, in a respectful manner. If she canâ€™t do that, the conversation is over and you walk away until she can. Be sure to use your words to explain this to her, and when she does speak to you respectfully, reward her by really listening and showing her the same respect. Positive reinforcement! 
- She doesnâ€™t have a right to every single detail of your plans and social life. You control the flow of information and share as much or as little as you want. If sheâ€™s prying, tell her politely but firmly that sheâ€™s being rude and she needs to give you some space.
 - Insert any other appropriate boundaries here. 

Finally, just briefly consider her point of view. While these in no way validate her treatment of you, understanding where sheâ€™s coming from may help you find the best way to manage the situation. Maybe:
 - sheâ€™s worried about you. A brief summary, or just reassurance that youâ€™ll be with friends you can trust, may be enough to satisfy her.
 - she feels abandoned when you go out, or like youâ€™re choosing someone else over her. Some reassurance of your love and concern for her could help, as well as making plans to spend time with her. 
 - sheâ€™s *jealous.* (â€œYou get to leave and be with your boyfriend, but she doesnâ€™t get a break? How unfair!â€) If thatâ€™s the case, arranging for her to have some time to herself or with friends might be helpful. If you think you can handle it, arranging for someone else to stay with your dad while you and your mom go take a break together, maybe to the movies or to get your nails done or whatever, might really help since it covers the jealousy and feelings of abandonment at the same time."
