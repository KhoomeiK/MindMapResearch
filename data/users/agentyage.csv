Knew a guy who had a totally healthy body but was so agoraphobic that being out of his house for a quick jaunt to the grocery meant he'd need 3 or 4 hours of recovery time for his panic attacks and other psychosomatic issues to reside. He tried for disability for years, never got it.

Either option seems possible to me. The latter seems a lot more likely. We saw the same thing happen with Obama and prosecuting the Bush administration. Obama could have gone after them, it would have been like pulling teeth though and Obamacare would probably not have happened and he would be removing some of his own powers as president in the process. So he chose to focus elsewhere because he though the political capital could be put to better use and the power the executive retained could be used responsibly.
