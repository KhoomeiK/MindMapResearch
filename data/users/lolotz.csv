bipolar,fejo08f,t3_epfysf,1579181234.0,I've been working on a picture similar to this!
bipolar,fefezis,t3_eov39p,1579054915.0,"I'm struggling so much with this exact thing right now. I hate it, also."
bipolar,fdt4k11,t1_fdse1v2,1578711830.0,"I think this was a big thing for me. My now husband knew as soon as we started hanging out about my issues. H could have walked away but didn't. In contrast, my ex husband had no idea what was going on and by the time it got diagnosed too much damage had been done for me to want to stay."
bipolar,fdt49tu,t3_emzeja,1578711720.0,"On my second marriage. Was diagnosed during my first, and we did not fare well. My husband now is more understanding, loving, accepting then anyone I have ever met."
bipolar,fds3z26,t3_emxbfe,1578693899.0,"I went thru something similar, where my psychiatrist decided I was doing well enough to be taken off a medication I was taking. I questioned if that was a good idea because any time I've been off medication has been  disastrous, but she insisted I was doing well and I trusted her.
Within a month I had developed a nasty mixed episode that caused me a lot of issues. During that time, I was assaulted by someone who knew the situation and knew I wasn't myself. Dealing with the aftermath of that nearly destroyed me.
I found a new doctor, who immediately said my gut feeling was right and I shouldn't have been taken off because as other comments have said, bipolar is an illness with no cure. 

I tell you all of this, because you know yourself and you know your illness; and if your doctor is not listening or if their decision is making you feel uncomfortable, then find a new doctor asap."
bipolar,fdp6s69,t3_emg756,1578621326.0,"Right there with you. I have such a hard time leaving my house without someone accompanying me, and even that is a struggle."
bipolar,fckoze7,t1_fckkoq0,1577730067.0,"Seconding this comment. 
I was in medication during my pregnancy. There is a huge stigma for it, but my doctor was extremely blunt with me that going off medication in order to stop the low chance of a defect doesn't matter if I'm dead. 
She was a maternal fetal medicine specialist. My obgyn referred me to her and once I was son her care she became my primary Dr."
bipolar,fbv252n,t1_fbus570,1577124157.0,Also wondering!
