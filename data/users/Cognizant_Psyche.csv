As do I.

That's not entirely true, at least not for all.  Perspective is everything, and much of it depends upon what is accepted as facts.  They believe what they do because it convinces them, for whatever reason (it varies), not just because of tradition and culture, even though it plays it's role.  Some people put more stock into feelings and intuition, and if that tells them that there is ""something"" out there as the cause and root of it then that becomes fact, even without empiricism.  

> Atheists try to show religious people and specially God incorrect and nonsense Mostly because of religion restrictions.

Also not entirely.  We simply point out inconstancies and ask for validation of the claims they make.

> Atheists don't even have good reasons for denying God.

Good, bad - all subjective.  Who are you to say?  Personally I don't deny anything as from my perspective there isn't anything to deny.  What ""good"" reasons should I have to accept that a god exists?  None have been given, so here we are.

Lack of evidence isn't evidence of evidence.

Cool story, you're entitled to believe that.  Why should I accept your claim?  I'm not trying to convince you here, you're the one with the positive claim, therefore the burden of proof is upon your shoulders.  

> We can just realize (By Thinking and all these beautiful things in our world) that he exists.

Beauty is subjective.  Thought can be erroneous especially when fallacies are used to fill in the unknown variables with subjective ideas.  ""The Easter Bunny Exists! We can just realize (By Thinking and all these beautiful things in our world) that he exists.""  How is that any different that what you said?  This is why evidence is important."
Parenting,fc5ifv4,t3_eg8ba2,1577458480.0,"Yep, I've cut ties with my own parental units for various reasons (See /r/raisedbynarcissists) and it only solidified my decision and intensified my resentment for how they were and how they raised us after I had kids - how could anyone do that to someone they *loved?*

It was a long road but I have finally come to terms with it all.  I grieved not for the loss of my actual parents, but rather the idea of what parents are meant to represent.  IMO Garbage people shouldn't be forgiven, especially if they aren't repentant or show any signs of remorse or growth.  With people like that they use the notion of forgiveness to excuse their behavior and enable them to continue the toxic actions by allowing them constant access. I will not forgive my parents, and I sure as the seven hells wont forget.  If not for myself then for my kids so that I don't repeat what I experienced or allow those horrible people access to them.  What kind of parent would I be if I allowed such toxicity unparalleled access to them as an authority figure and ""loved one?""

Good on you for realizing what must be done and don't let anyone bully you into thinking you must forgive.  People tend to project their own situations and experiences especially when it comes to parents, it doesn't help either that most cultures put extreme importance upon respecting parents.  They don't know you or your circumstances.  If you feel you must forgive, then dont forget."
DebateAnAtheist,faorr55,t3_ea8hhe,1576271088.0,"> Burden of Proof. 

The Burden of Proof lies upon the shoulders of the one making the positive claim.  You aren't saying X deity doesn't exist, only that you arent convinced that it does.  They are the ones who are making the claim of it's existence so it is upon them to present the evidence.

> Morality. 

I mean this is a whole other discussion, but it boils down to this: ""Name one thing 'good' that is impossible to do without belief in a deity?"" If they can't name one (and they  can't) then ask why is belief or it's existence necessary?

> The Afterlife

Is the only thing worthwhile or of value that which is infinite or possesses unparalleled longevity?  Technically yes, it is meaningless (intrinsically) but so what?  If someone offered you a fine meal at the highest of establishments would you decline and lament about the futility of eating as you will only be hungry a short while later?  No, you would indulge and savor the flavors and experience and revel in the moment.  The same could be said about our lives.  So what if it is ""meaningless?""  We are able to live in the moment, why is that not enough?  Would that meal be any less meaningful knowing it is finite and fleeting?  If anything it has more worth as it is a rare treat and experience.  Life is no different.  One could argue that letting opportunities and experiences pass without partaking in hopes of getting something better with no guarantees other than hearsay and wishes is the real definition of meaningless and sin."
