ChildrenofDeadParents,fguxr2w,t3_f09j2l,1581131830.0,"I feel the exact same way. My dad also died when I was thirteen but that was only four years ago. I have definitely learned to live with it and I still think about him, but it’s more in remembrance then being sad. Although, right after I heard the news of Kobe and his daughters passing- it brought a lot of those same emotions I had the first few weeks after my dad died. I was a mess, i thought the world was over, i wouldn’t eat for days and i just stayed in my room sleep/crying all day. I only know a small portion of what they are going through, they lost their dad/husband but they also lost their sister/daughter and I couldn’t even imagine what it would be like to have this horrible event to be publicized to the extent that it was."

ChildrenofDeadParents,fg7zqrl,t3_exb8wj,1580605687.0,"I lost my dad around the same time as you. (July of 2016.) I feel the exact same way, sometimes I feel like it’s all some sort of dream and that he will just come home- but obviously that’s not going to happen. Its such an odd feeling because he died at someone else’s house and then he was cremated so I never got to see him “dead” and it never truly does feel real. If you aren’t in therapy, I would suggest trying it! I only did it for a few months but it really helped me just talk about it in a non judgmental environment.
I don’t get it either, people who have lost someone important in their life- just have to accept it. There’s nothing that they can do and we just have to learn how to live with it."

The first one I pretty much cried the whole day( i was 13 though). If you need a day off from school take it, if you want to pretend like it’s a normal day that’s okay, if you want to do something that reminds you of her then do it. Do what ever feels right. Also, do you have an adult or family member you could talk too? I’ve found that people our age, who haven’t lost a parent just don’t understand. Hang in there :)"
ChildrenofDeadParents,ffufjfv,t3_ev4o4y,1580240887.0,For some reason everything about Kobe and Giana’s death hit me really hard even though I don’t even like basketball. Seeing all of the pictures and everything thing brought me back to when my dad suddenly at 13 and those memories really hurt. I know the pain his family is going through and I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. I do get super annoyed when I see people say “I don’t know how I would live with myself if my husband and daughter died” or “ I would kill myself if my dad and sister died”

AskTeenGirls,ffj2oje,t3_etx4br,1579988872.0,"Confidence can definitely mean a lot in relation to someone’s attractiveness. I think guys who are confident in themselves, able to have conversations and not be awkward are more attractive. Although, Confidence is very different from arrogance. When the guy goes from, I am comfortable with my self- to thinking they are better than other people is when the attractiveness declines. So to answer your question, yes confidence is 100 percent attractive as long as they don’t have a huge ego."

It definitely requires a lot more out of class time work, and I’m not sure if I would take a math class structured like this again, but so far it’s going okay."
