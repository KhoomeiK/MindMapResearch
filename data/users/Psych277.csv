thisismylifenow,fehg36t,t1_feh0xmp,1579115814.0,"We have plans to go to the Tim Burton art exhibit at the Neon Museum one of the days. Staying 3 nights at New York New York, so will do a bar crawl inside one of the days. Was thinking about just walking around Fremont St. people-watching. I'm sure we'll find some way to occupy ourselves. Thanks for the suggestion!"
thisismylifenow,feggjn7,t1_feg5vr8,1579092030.0,I'm headed to Vegas in a week and was just struck by the terrible realization that I'm too old for this shit.
criticalrole,febp27w,t1_febmw1q,1578961186.0,"I agree, Gunslinger Fighter is my preference between the two. Just saying that with a bit of creativity Artificer can become just about anything thematically."
criticalrole,feblrbs,t1_febjn2m,1578960108.0,"It's not too bad. I played a Lizardfolk Artificer who just played with trash piles and random human refuse. Everything was nonmagical (as far as he knew). If that can work, gunslinger can work just fine."
criticalrole,febgf0c,t1_febbnr9,1578958572.0,"Just reskin it. Play it the same, but with the old western flair."

dndnext,fdeoruq,t3_ektwzg,1578343485.0,Your sheets are all I use. Super excited to try the updates!
Showerthoughts,fcf3ccb,t1_fcdsj2r,1577626264.0,I think everyone would agree that does are a good thing.
Showerthoughts,fcf3557,t1_fccsn6h,1577626204.0,Absolutely! There are lots of intro articles online too.
Showerthoughts,fcbbu5m,t1_fcar2ap,1577584957.0,Hell yeah
Showerthoughts,fcbbrwq,t1_fcb4gfp,1577584934.0,Toilets are exactly like anywhere else. Either gender-divided or single person. Mi weirdness at all.
Showerthoughts,fcb1pvk,t1_fcb0x88,1577581009.0,We go to Couples Sans Souci a couple times a year. Sort of this idea.
Showerthoughts,fcb1mxp,t1_fcb0g55,1577580961.0,My dude. Best show ever.
Showerthoughts,fcathl0,t1_fcas4ua,1577576296.0,"Because that's the social etiquette in most AN social circles. Not my rules, just what is standard."
Showerthoughts,fcarc1o,t1_fcaqmo6,1577575090.0,"Check out the AANR. We're not members, but we go to AN resorts on vacations. DM me for more info."
Showerthoughts,fcar55d,t1_fcaq0bi,1577574971.0,"Dude, chill. If you have a boner, you either lay dick-down on your lounger, you get in the pool, or you drape your towel over your lap. You don't keep an erection forever, it goes away eventually."
Showerthoughts,fcaps6r,t1_fcaomz7,1577574149.0,Hedonism II
Showerthoughts,fcapqbi,t1_fcako07,1577574118.0,Nothing but single person showers for this guy. Get on my level.
Showerthoughts,fca2e2z,t1_fca2a7d,1577562033.0,You won't be. It really doesn't work like that.
Showerthoughts,fca2ah2,t1_fc9zr6k,1577561984.0,Primarily outdoors so no couches.
Showerthoughts,fc9xai8,t1_fc9wqop,1577559576.0,"You really shouldn't be worried. I was worried at first too, but in most places no one is looking for sex. You really start to understand that the only difference between a boob and an elbow is the sexual value we place on it. Without that energy, everyone's skin is just skin.

But if you do get a boner, just get in the pool. No one sees it under the water."
Showerthoughts,fc9vyoa,t1_fc9utf6,1577559003.0,"People really don't get it until you experience it. Most nudist environments are non-sexual and no different than any other resort or campground, other than you don't have to worry about current fashion or wet bathing suits. Honestly, nudists are some of the most genuine, least judgemental people you'll ever meet. It's almost as if clothing is a barrier for opening up to others. Once you have nothing to hide behind, it's much easier to just be yourself, without any pretense or expectations."
Showerthoughts,fc9o3oc,t1_fc9n6sy,1577555603.0,"Not in my experience. Showers are usually in your own room, not in public."
Showerthoughts,fc9gj1q,t1_fc9ab1b,1577552349.0,"Beach bag, just like everyone else."
Showerthoughts,fc9gfrv,t1_fc99d00,1577552312.0,Beach bag. No clothes doesn't mean no belongings.
Showerthoughts,fc9g5po,t1_fc938s3,1577552193.0,This is correct. It's poor etiquette to sit anywhere without a towel.
nfl,fc96epk,t1_fc7loo2,1577547764.0,"Dude, that's funny. You didn't deserve the downvotes."
DMAcademy,fc2p35i,t3_eftzud,1577369731.0,"Seems like it could be tweaked without an overhaul. What are his motivations for greed? Maybe he's grown up having to scrape by, so he values the security that coin can bring. He's never been shown kindness or seen real good in action. Maybe after he sees the good that the party does, which he does, he sees the gratitude and feels the warm fuzzies that come with doing good without reward. Maybe he still doesn't respect the law and has no issue with killing those who deserve it, but maybe he finds a soft spot for those who need help. The character can work in this party, but the player will need to think a bit harder about history and motivations, as well as figuring out the direction of growth."
Wellthatsucks,fc04pth,t3_efc7mp,1577278461.0,Right there with you. Covering a shift in a residential facility so the folks with kids can be home with them today.
