JapanTravel,ffaez99,t1_ff7gmoe,1579734142.0,"> During my most recent trip to Japan we made sure to have a less structured itinerary. And lemme tell you, it was my absolute favorite trip there ever. Just wandering the streets and stumbling on a cute cafe or having a long, leisurely dinner was refreshing.
