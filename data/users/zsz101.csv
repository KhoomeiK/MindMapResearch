fatlogic,feyqrwm,t1_feyojle,1579449362.0,Agreed.  It happened to me too.  I got sucked into the “eat as much as you want plant based diet” thing years ago and was confused as to why my weight shot up.  After meeting with an RD I realized my breakfast of two cups of oats and a pile of nuts had well over 1k worth of calories.  The more you know as they say.
fatlogic,feyq3oh,t1_feylycv,1579449143.0,"Good point about the host.  In my opinion she demonstrates exactly how you can talk about these things with sensitivity while being honest, which actually helps everyone.  Sadly, I feel like radical FA people would slam the entire show for “fat shaming” and “diet culture,” even though it actually helps people."
fatlogic,feyhk9i,t1_fey8ddt,1579445675.0,I also wonder what it would be like watching that show with a radical fat acceptance person?  In one episode a man at a buffet loads his plate up with 11 roasted potatoes along with mountains of everything else.  Would they claim that’s his body telling him what it needs?
fatlogic,feyg6j0,t1_fey8ddt,1579445068.0,Best show of all time!  My favorite part of that show is how almost all the people think they aren’t eating enough!
fatlogic,fe5gvkq,t3_enqqdd,1578869273.0,"I have obstructive sleep apnea and even with my BMI being 25 (overweight, and yes I believe in BMI) my doctors have all told me that losing even a little weight can have a tremendous impact.  In fact, after further questioning, they told me that weight is the most significant risk factor for OSA.  Guess what I did?  I believed them and got my shit in gear.  Guess what I didn’t do?  Rant on the internet about how fatphobic my docs are.  Boggles my mind we’re now at a point in society where doctors presenting medical facts triggers such extreme emotions in some folks.  I certainly hope we don’t end up with a future where doctors are no longer allowed to suggest any kind of lifestyle treatments."
fatlogic,fbtf8aa,t1_fbgkgk2,1577076852.0,Ditto.  Can someone please explain to me what FA people mean by this?  I assume it refers to eating enough.  The funny thing is the people I hear using this word are all overweight and constantly worry they aren’t eating enough to “nourish” themselves.
