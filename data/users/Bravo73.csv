Responding with an ego that is hurt is never the answer.
Control your ego instead of allowing it to control you."

Not to say we cannot possibly flourish in some other aspects in life. 
I understand this is to be a motivator, but in many peoples lives it is simply unrealistic."
SkyPorn,fe4wnzw,t3_ennqzk,1578863443.0,Is this real? Holy moly.

GetMotivated,fdawpj7,t3_ek6wf0,1578251255.0,"Not discussing what is hurting or bothering you is no way to move past it. 
Keeping it in side and reliving it over and over is toxic and will only hold and keep you on that moment of pain forever. 

You need to let it go!"
