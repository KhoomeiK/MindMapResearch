cats,fcrtf47,t3_eijevp,1577906376.0,"She looks so good!! Congrats! When you cut down on her food intake and switched to timed feedings, did you do it all at once or slowly decrease the amount of food? I also have 2 cats who currently free eat and one needs to lose weight. I'm trying to figure out the best approach without making him miserable or making him worry he's gonna starve."
