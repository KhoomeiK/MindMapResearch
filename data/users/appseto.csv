movies,fe5x004,t3_enrela,1578876829.0,"A lot of the Disney Dark Age in my opinion: Robin Hood, The Aristocats, The Rescuers. Plus The Sword in the Stone which isn't a part of the Dark Age. These are all imo some of the best Disney have to offer, but with their low earnings and the death of Walt Disney they were branded as failures. The fact that Robin Hood traced over some sequences form earlier films to save money is often used against it, which overall is a small part of the movie's animation, and especially the whole movie.

And for anyone who is thinking, ""But The Great Mouse Detective is from the Dark Age. How can you not mention that."" It's because while definitely not the most well-known, I feel like it's considered one of the best of the Dark Age by the majority of people."
asoiaf,fdzjdm7,t1_fdv9m53,1578790783.0,Thanks! Going by the completion-to-release times of the previous books is probably the best way to tell how it will be for TWOW.

asoiaf,fdsskiu,t1_fdsrdfu,1578707396.0,Thanks! So if it *does* come out in august then we could expect an announcement april-june.

movies,fddvceo,t3_ekr2c9,1578324886.0,"*Bambi*(1942). Beautiful animation and story. One of Disney's best imo.

Also *His Girl Friday*(1940). Genuinely funny with an interesting story."
movies,fddv1ge,t3_ektzj7,1578324672.0,"I just read this for the first time, and I'm torn on whether I want to see it in movie form. Fantastic book, but a movie of it would be like the last 20/30 minutes of Texas Chain saw Massacre spread over an entire film.

Still, I definitely would be interested with a movie of it, sickening as it might be, and agree that it would be a great idea for Pixar to have a separate division for more adult movies. Your idea of it being animated is fantastic, but I think that some of the more horrific elements might work even better in 2d form. Maybe a japanese animated adaptation?"
Christianity,fd6a3xr,t3_ejvi8h,1578187841.0,"If your friends are really your friends, then they'll accept you. If you want to be more like Christ, then that can only be a positive, and they'll see that.

Feelings like the ones you're having are precious. You need to grab onto that and see where it takes you. If this is truly a calling from God (as I believe it is), then that is truly an amazing thing. That message of love and compassion; that applies to *you*. And what a personal testimony of that love to be urged by God Himself.

Another thing to consider is that, if you get the urge to go to church, there are *so* many possibilities. The fractured nature of the church might not be a truly positive thing, but it does offer an amazing opportunity to find a place that you fit in.

There are a million arguments for Jesus' divinity that have been made by some of the greatest minds in history. I'm not one of those minds, but I would just say that a relationship with God is a very personal thing. Feelings are an important part of the human experience. Don't discount these that you're having. Chase them"
todayilearned,fcwhxyy,t1_fcwhr81,1578026092.0,That's a fair point.
todayilearned,fcw4fvb,t1_fcvv784,1578016914.0,"That's a cool bit of info. I love Disney World, but that seems like pretty shitty design. Why put all the effort into making the park so charming and the lands so well-designed if you don't let people soak it all in? Disneyland has plenty of benches, and I actually found it to be more orderly."
todayilearned,fcvpepb,t1_fcvlmn3,1578007114.0,"Disney World keeps with Disneyland's tradition of cleanliness and trash can accessibility. What surprised me was how much more seating there was in Disneyland. I love Disney World, but there's a distinct lack of benches when compared with Disneyland."
freefolk,fcrf7q3,t1_fcppgt1,1577901029.0,It really is fantastic.
freefolk,fcozujk,t3_ei8zq2,1577846196.0,"I love the design of those covers, as well as the american versions. If this is your first read, you're in for a treat."
freefolk,fcoy6qj,t3_ei06jt,1577844849.0,"I just plan on rewatching season 1-4. Those were the show's golden years, and ""The Children"" feels like a solid ending, albeit with many many unresolved threads. There's so many amazing moments there. It would be a shame to let the absolutely terrible ending take away your enjoyment of them. Diminished, sure, but not taken away.

And then there's always the books. The first three are the story that we all know and love, and the last two are what should have happened. People took issue with them for the extra plot lines (some of which are the best parts of those books but that's just imo) which only made the story harder to resolve, but with S8 premiering that seems to have turned around. The show cutting or altering those plot lines led to what we got, a puzzle with half the pieces missing."
freefolk,fcox931,t1_fcmz0p9,1577844089.0,"I'd advise rewatching only season 1-4. It has a certain sense of closure, albeit with a lot unresolved, and is before the show started its decline. Season 8 was terrible, but don't let that stop you from watching some of the best television ever made.

Edit: and, if you haven't already, read the books. They're all great, some better than others, but all at the same general level of quality. There's the content you love from the first four seasons with some differences and additions, but then after that the story changes in surprising ways. Books 4 and 5 give the true continuation of the story."

Nope. Just a worse version of what we've already seen."

Christianity,fc326te,t1_fbuwvvn,1577379742.0,"I feel like an important thing to realize is that the Bible is so big, so complex, with so many different ways to interpret things, that calling something unbiblical is often the wrong way to go about things. Some liberal christians might think your interpretations of scripture to be unbiblical. It might seem ridiculous to you, but I guarantee that they're out there.

I'd also like to explain some of the views that you mentioned in the post, and how they aren't always unbiblical.

Some liberal christians believe that the verses denouncing homosexuality in the NT were not supposed to be denouncing that at all. That might seem an impossible view, and you might say, ""but it says it right there in the bible"", but if you look at certain older translations you will find that it wasn't always translated to ""homosexual"". One thing to always keep in mind is that these were written in ancient languages, and as such it's a good idea to go back to the language that it was written in to understand a complicated verse. It's the opinion of some scholars that the two words now translated to ""homosexual"" actually translate to denounce male prostitutes and men who groomed young boys (a common practice at the time).

Now whether you agree with this or not isn't the issue. There's an argument to be made in the other way, but when gone about in this way it's impossible to call the view unbiblical. You could call it a false interpretation, but the method is undeniably Biblical.

And finally, the support of transgender people. The only verse that I'm aware of that can be used to denounce the transition of transgender people is: *Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created. (Genesis 5:2)*

And the easiest response that I can give to that is hermaphroditic people. They don't fit into a male or female box, and so obviously there are exceptions in creation. That cannot be denied. And so we can say the same for transgender people as those who are hermaphrodites. They're a tiny fraction of humanity, a small exception.

I hope I helped make clear how people go about interpreting the Bible in perhaps very different ways, while still coming from a Biblical perspective."

pics,fbzmdbw,t1_fbzku8p,1577251656.0,Imo it's not a bad movie. Not the best Spider-Man movie but still worth a watch if you're interested. You might end up really liking it.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fbzf3o5,t1_fbzdc3m,1577244588.0,"I'll second that it's a really good movie. It's definitely weird, certain scenes feeling almost dream-like, with that signature Coen Brothers comedy sprinkled throughout."
