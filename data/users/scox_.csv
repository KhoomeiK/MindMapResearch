I also never thought about how hard it must be to be in that relationship and feel like you can’t talk to anyone because of how you would be viewed, or the lack of resources for someone experiencing it. 

I also feel like as time goes on, with more and more people growing up estranged from parents and other family and how easy genealogy makes it to reconnect, that this is only going to become more prevalent."

She has deleted all her social media and changed her phone number. She won’t respond to email. This is my attempt to let her know I am here and not judging her. 

You don’t know my friend, I do.

offmychest,fcglq0x,t1_fcgke91,1577641459.0,"It’s a phenomenon called genetic sexual attraction and it happens a lot when two estranged relatives meet again as adults — sometimes they know they’re related, sometimes they don’t. 

But with my friend personally, she went from hating this man, to spending every day with him, to moving in with him, adopting animals to raise with him, legally changing her name to the name he wanted her to have and basically isolating herself from every person in her life besides him. Every social media post was photos of them together and if you were someone who didn’t know her, you would have definitely thought it was a relationship situation. I think she started to feel pressure and think people were finding out or at least making assumptions, and then she moved across the country with him. Fast forward to now, it’s been 7 months since anyone here has heard from her, and every social media account is gone. Her phone doesn’t work. I think they moved so they could live as boyfriend/girlfriend in a place where no one knew the truth."

I’m afraid if we do and they make contact that it might scare her even more and make her even less likely to contact anyone. That’s why I’m looking for her here where I can keep her somewhat anonymous. I know the situation is specific enough that if she reads my post, she’ll know it’s me looking for her and reach out.

Any records I’ve found for her have basically been wiped, and I’ve found quite a few for him but they’re literally all over the place like different addresses in different states and stuff. He deleted all his socials when she did. I’m really scared because the whole reason they were estranged while we were growing up was because he was a violent and VERY manipulative sociopath, and she never wanted anything to do with him. But sociopaths are really good at getting their claws in and then isolating their victim. It’s just a whole other wrench in the situation that they’re dad and daughter."

Her whole family thought something was going on and they were all pretty cold, I always defended her and was like “no, she’s just happy he’s back in her life,” but I know they’re right. I’ve actually done a lot of research while looking for her, and it’s called genetic sexual attraction. In 50% of cases where a child is estranged from a parent until adulthood, there is an attraction from at least one party involved when they reunite, and way more often than I ever would have thought, sexual relationships develop. I’m pretty positive she’s moved across the country with him so she can live as his girlfriend in a place where no one knows their real relationship. There’s almost no support for people in these relationships, and I can’t imagine how lonely she must feel right now."

It’s called genetic sexual attraction and people that are experiencing it don’t really seem to have anywhere to turn for help or support so I can imagine how lonely she has to be feeling with a secret like that and no one to talk to."
