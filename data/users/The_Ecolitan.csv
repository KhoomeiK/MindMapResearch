Skookum,ff59tbn,t1_ff4uk9i,1579584586.0,"Thanks for this, I couldn't remember the name of this tool for the life of me. We always call it the ""french tickler."""
InterestingVideoClips,ff240me,t1_ff2193c,1579493198.0,Don’t you mean the barn?
nfl,ff1uqvs,t1_ff1uhng,1579486629.0,I bought four kinds of cheese. That’s a lot of cheese.
nfl,ff1umox,t1_ff1ugdy,1579486557.0,Is this where we add the obligatory FTP?
nfl,ff1ue1y,t3_er41w0,1579486402.0,"The Niners scored 20 points while my kid and I were in Costco. I was totally shocked. Every time I walked past the tv’s to check the score, it was up."
NotMyJob,feza2er,t1_fez0cmr,1579455211.0,"Man, I would be so happy with a $10 leg of lamb, braise it with some carrots, make garlic mashed potatoes, open a bottle of cabarnet, Ohh baby."
sciencefiction,fet8tp5,t3_eqg9w0,1579372851.0,"I really enjoyed this when I read it. I felt the author was very invested in her main character becoming the helicopter and feeling complete only in the sky. This is a very common theme, it’s too bad their writing was hijacked, especially by people who didn’t even read it."
nba,fet0uv1,t1_fep2mu6,1579370815.0,"Thank you for naming the big white guy. I don’t follow the NBA, but I wanted to know who the confused sideline giant was."

minnesotatwins,fefofqp,t3_eounfz,1579060829.0,Dip me in shit and roll me in oats. They went for it. Going down I5 to see them play in San Diego. I better get outfield seats for the dong show.
nfl,feff56w,t1_feekycm,1579055010.0,I would enjoy this. I always laughed at Rivers jawing with the fans at away games.
cats,feca8cs,t3_eo9df2,1578969452.0,"That’s super cute. One of my three will ride my shoulder around the house. It was cuter when she was a kitten, as opposed to ten pounds of clumsy claws."
nfl,fe62vrz,t3_env82r,1578880554.0,Are both teams gong to sit their defenses in the 4th?  Those were three quick scores.
nfl,fe624cy,t1_fe61j9b,1578880071.0,That game was benign compared to the two AFC smack downs.
nfl,fe61n2s,t1_fe61jrl,1578879769.0,Coincidence? Probably not.
nfl,fe5vwr4,t3_env82r,1578876131.0,These Wilson scrambles are crazy. He runs around forever back there.

nfl,fe5skpe,t1_fe5s4q6,1578874020.0,I thought something sounded wrong. Cayman Island tourism got angry.
nfl,fe5sh2v,t1_fe5s5g4,1578873958.0,"My tailgate goes up and down, and locks . That’s literally my only requirements."
nfl,fe5qfnm,t1_fe5q184,1578873115.0,"I remember this game as well. My buddy said “Let’s go the the mall, this is over.” or something like that. Walk into Sears 1/2 an hour later, and watched the end on a wall of TV’s. We were both shocked."
nfl,fe5oys2,t1_fe5oo23,1578872440.0,Especially Houston. What a collapse.
nfl,fe5op29,t3_ens4mf,1578872308.0,"What the hell. I left at halftime to take the kid grocery shopping, come back to 51 points. WTF."
minnesotavikings,fe0e77l,t3_eng3zg,1578811622.0,"At a watch party as the only Vikings fan in attendance in 49er territory. I received no shit talking at all. Just a “Sorry, bro.” Somehow, that was worse."
AskReddit,fdrueki,t1_fdr3j8n,1578689887.0,"We live in California, and I took the wife and kiddo to visit my aunt in Minneapolis a few years ago. Sunday rolls around, and my wife wanted to make Irish Cream for my aunt and her friends at the condo complex. I walked to the liquor store, and stared at a locked building with the lights off. I was very confused. We can get booze practically anywhere."
minnesotavikings,fdqm3yw,t1_fdqkwso,1578669928.0,"It was a gal in Cleveland, coming from California, that is one weird accent. She pronounced bat more like bet. It took me a second."
minnesotavikings,fdqh07f,t1_fdqbse0,1578666444.0,This is what I want to know! They took away the mini bat I bought my daughter at Progressive Field when I flew back to Minneapolis on the way home. Jerks.
baseball,fdg1ygz,t1_fdg1p4m,1578377039.0,"My plan is about the same, Rockies and DBacks would be a trip, Royals and Cardinals, Rangers and Astros, etc. Getting back East would make the triple a little easier."
baseball,fdg1857,t1_fdg0qvl,1578376312.0,"Thanks for the reply. I’ll make a note to check it all out. What’s good to eat at Petco? The way the schedule works, the Dodgers are playing SF, I’ll see the Twins in SD, and Seattle in Anaheim. It should be a fun little jaunt."
baseball,fdg0kwa,t1_fdg09o0,1578375685.0,"I think this next trip will put me at 11. I’ll have the whole shebang done in 6 or 7 years. I work in ag, so September is a pretty easy time to get away. I’m planning on driving cross country with a travel trailer when I retire in 20 years and watch spring training in Florida. That’s not an option now."
baseball,fdfykc9,t1_fdfy5lo,1578373848.0,"Is Petco that nice? Even though I’m a Twins fan, AT&T is where I see the most games. I’m driving down I5 next September to watch the Twins play in SD. I’ll hit the Dodgers on the way down, and the Angels on the way home."

todayilearned,fdaaq5t,t1_fdaaexc,1578243799.0,"These things literally fall off the trucks and roll down the road without breaking. During harvest, they gather at the corners of the on ramps when they bounce out of the tubs. They are bred to be mostly solids, they’re a little smaller than your fist."
todayilearned,fda16jk,t1_fd9rmbj,1578240490.0,"They are talking about the tomatoes that go into sauce, not the fresh kind on your hamburger. Look up processing tomatoes."
todayilearned,fda0km1,t1_fd9iohj,1578240339.0,"You are badly wrong on this. Modern processing tomatoes can easily hit 50-55 tons per acre. They are grown on drip irrigation, you can target water to the root zone and feed the plant throughout the growing cycle. Under prime conditions, I’ve seen a field hit 72 tons. They had to leave some behind as the contract was filled."
food,fd3j8tf,t1_fd2qyjr,1578158858.0,"Get it as a taco with a side of consommé. We have a truck where I live and it’s all birria, all the time when I go there. Their other stuff is good, but their birria is outstanding."
food,fd3ilkw,t1_fd0g8kr,1578158664.0,"I’ve begun to dislike tri-tip on a roll. It’s very seldom rare enough for me, and it’s treated more like a French Dip with a side of beans. I learned to make it Santa Maria style, it needs to be separate, damn it."
nfl,fd3fh3p,t1_fd3ddec,1578157786.0,"He wanted to call it Jonestown, but that was taken."
seriouseats,fco43zu,t3_ehw2d4,1577823709.0,"I have this as well. My edition is older than I am. I particularly like the wine pairings suggested for the food. I made one of the stews and served a Beaujolais with it as per the suggestion. One of our friends is very into wine & food, and just couldn’t compliment me enough. It’s a great old school book. I need to get Volume Two someday."
dogswithjobs,fcjavpr,t3_ehbdwb,1577681670.0,They have a rotating cast of these dogs at the terminal. I have “baseball” cards from four of them. They’re all good dogs.
whatisthisthing,fccov41,t1_fccnxjx,1577600900.0,"The road comes to a “T” past the old family farm. There’s no ditch or culvert, so if you miss the turn like I did about thirty years ago, it’s into the field you go. Thankfully I was driving a late 70’s LTD, so no harm was done."
whatisthisthing,fcckuow,t1_fccf1by,1577599562.0,Or they dead end into a harvested corn field in North Dakota. Lack of signage is fun.
Naturewasmetal,fc6p90h,t3_egfcff,1577486029.0,"Man, I love these. It’s my favorite skeleton at the Smithsonian Natural History museum. I’ve always thought these were so cool."
Old_Recipes,fc1dipr,t3_efe11j,1577315518.0,"The sole meunière is such a classic dish. I just saw Martha Stewart make it, now this. I think the universe is telling me to find some sole."
Skookum,fbuzdry,t1_fbu1j6e,1577122856.0,That is a very apt description. I like it.
