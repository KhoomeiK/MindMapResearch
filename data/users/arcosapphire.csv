This claim is widely stated, and also widely (but clearly not quite as widely) corrected. We don't start as phenotypically female. It's not like we start one way and then only males change. Even excluding intersex situations, male and female start from a similar template but then both develop away from that in different ways.

The ""phenotypically female"" idea seems largely based on two things: fetuses initially have something vagina-like (but *do not* have fully developed female sex organs), and individuals with androgen insensitivity look female in a number of ways. But in the latter case, all that implies is that the genetic difference caused them to *develop along the female path* rather than that we just are female by default.
