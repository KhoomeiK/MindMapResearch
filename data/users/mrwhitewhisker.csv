That’s so valuable, even if it’s hard to make good money in the field, but you’re going to have the qualifications to get something, even if it’s not the level you want to be at immediately. i’m 25 and dropped out of college, but i’ve found that degrees are more about just showing that you have a knowledge base. You’ll be able to get so many “regular” jobs, office jobs and the like, that you totally don’t need to worry. Everyone’s timeline is different but yours sounds great to me! I relate to your social sentiments as well, so you’re not alone."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ff6zm8n,t1_ff66kso,1579638157.0,"I just want to re-frame for you for a minute, because it totally sounds like you’re being too hard on yourself. The only square one you’ll really fall back to is where you are right now! If you’re doing decently, you’ve got a degree, then you’re successful! True success is relative, but as far as baseline success goes, you’re totally there, my friend."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ff6uag4,t1_ff6au8w,1579635022.0,"Thank you for sharing this, i feel less alone. I’m 25 and still don’t really know what i’m doing. I like the train analogy, everyone is riding a different train, some people are on the same train, but for the most part everyone has their own.  Everyone’s train stops at different lessons and locations, but they all keep moving just the same."

legaladvice,fdpjb8c,t1_fdpfied,1578630165.0,"There are lots of online therapies now! Since you’re on the road a lot and all. I’m so sorry this is all going on; for real, my deepest sympathies.

LifeProTips,fdpiwsc,t3_emkv86,1578629847.0,"i’ve had the urge recently to get rid of all of my personal development/spiritually leaning books and donate them to jails or prisons, i feel like that’s a better energetic transfer than getting $60 (if that) at half price books"
conspiracy,fdpi515,t1_fdpfp9z,1578629255.0,"look, i wanted Qanon to be real, but you’ve got to really evaluate what’s gone on during his presidency. even if he is dismantling the pedophile networks, not everyone that is bad for this world is a pedophile, and he’s actually doing quite a bit of harm to the world. regardless of sea levels and that side of climate change, he’s dismantling environmental protections! if he really cared about the whole wide world he really wouldn’t do those things. sure, you can say he’s keeping people in his pocket like qanon followers say about israel, but why would he sensationalize himself like he does? i mean, i’m totally open to it being the longest game ever and trump being the worlds messiah but on an intuitive level it just doesn’t seem like the case anymore.

edit because i want to add that i 100% agree that he is demonized like nothing we’ve ever seen before, except maybe osama or saddam, and it’s totally fishy but i think it’s makes the democratic bandwagon a lot more obvious to people. i think the chaos has honestly been great for opening up discussion amongst everyone you interact with daily and then you can really start to discuss and share ideas like we’re supposed to."

Advice,fdmc1ur,t3_em4gj3,1578545173.0,"i’m not well versed on the exact neurological impacts, but from my own personal experience it can hinder your emotional development/regulation capacity. although it relieves your anxiety now, that could change one day and it could become an anxiety trigger (happened to me). it deflects the feelings that you feel from what happens in your life so that you don’t have to deal with it, but that energy is still stored in your body and mind at varying levels of awareness and that energy needs to be processed through. 

it’s not going to give you brain damage necessarily, but it’s not going to necessarily assist in brain development either."

The intro feels a tiny bit angsty. You have talent for sure though, so keep creating and your style will flow through. I totally enjoy the song overall."

dpdr,fdl03kz,t1_fdkzmzi,1578514674.0,"if you do feel up to taking them, the number one piece of advice i have is to stay outside. get a campsite, go in safe woods, something like that and the energy will be much better. 

i think it depends on how open to the cosmic you are, also. i have a friend who’s not so open to the spiritual side of life and he doesn’t enjoy mushrooms at all. but when i’ve been more open to that side of life, it’s much easier to accept things with blind faith."
dpdr,fdkyyx6,t1_fdkyj1z,1578514056.0,"different mushrooms have different potencies so just be careful. and honestly i’m in the same place mentally where i don’t feel like i’d be able to go with the flow very easily. even when i enjoyed mushrooms a lot it was always very chaotic for me, but now that the novelty is gone it’s moreso just uncomfortable mentally and physically but that’s also a product of my own personal mental health. i think for me it would be beneficial if i was guided through the experience by a progressive psychologist/therapist/spiritual mentor but on my own i don’t think i’d take it well."
dpdr,fdky28v,t1_fdkxeis,1578513519.0,it depends heavily on the dose but also on your state of mind. if you succumb to fear you’ll get real twisted but if you surrender and let go and jut take it for what it is it’s an easier time.

dpdr,fdkc1mz,t3_eltffc,1578500697.0,"yeah i think your anxiety from being so detached is what caused the panic attack at the gym. i’ve always experienced anxiety attacks but i’ve experiences two full on panic attacks recently and i finally understand when people say they feel like they’re dying (my mom has a really hard time with panic attacks and i was always very dismissive about it when she told me it felt like she was dying), it’s a slow black out process for sure."
dpdr,fdkbpbh,t3_elos1h,1578500490.0,"on my first mushroom trip i detached so hard that i couldn’t tell the difference between memories that i had from movies, tv shows, just media in general, and what were my personal memories. i could recall memories but had absolutely no idea what was from “me”. now it just sort of seems like i’m this narrator character for this person that has these memories and i feel very third party to them in a way mostly because my perspective on them is obviously going to be different which makes life feel even more stressful and inconsistent."
MMFB,fdipmy3,t1_fdfu9by,1578448213.0,"hey, i just want you to know i’m going through a really similar situation. not really with the friend involvement, but everything else. you’re not alone. i’m sorry i don’t have any advice because i’m struggling just to make it through the day but i can empathize."
dpdr,fdindvu,t3_ejt4b0,1578446778.0,"Yes, I’ve been sexually assaulted irl but have had dreams of even more intense assault encounters than i’ve personally experienced. I had a nightmare when I was maybe 6 or so that a tornado hit me, my mom, and our dog, and due to my lack of physics knowledge at the time, there was this precedent that if you were wet you wouldn’t get hurt, so we jumped out of a tall building window out into the water below and her and my dog fell faster into the water and made it safe, while i was hit by the tornado, which made a buzzer noise and said “sorry!” in a very smug and sarcastic tone. When i eventually landed i asked my mom for one last kiss and she said no and walked away. I have a lot of dreams about relationship betrayals. I took seroquel for a while and i stopped dreaming but i didn’t like the way it made me feel overall."
dpdr,fdimuw3,t3_eka179,1578446442.0,i also have really bad ocd and these are intrusive thoughts. some people’s thoughts are more visual than others. they’re the hardest thing i’ve ever had to deal with in my life.

death,fcz5x6s,t3_eh76sq,1578094320.0,"You could try to structure the process of healing by setting aside time to yourself, where you can do what you do to feel your way through it, followed by some true to you self care. so then you let yourself empty out that energy and put yourself in whatever environment most conducive to making you feel at peace.

edit: you should also check out @the.holistic.psychologist on instagram, she has a specific inner child meditation that everyone loves"
death,fcz5kqs,t1_fcm1lvh,1578094121.0,"But see why does the fact that it’s special mean we shouldn’t exercise our free will to end it if we don’t find it special enough, or too up and down to handle? 

When everything feels like you literally can’t even continue to breath, and staying alive comes with the stipulation that you still have to go through the daily grind at minimum just so you can keep a roof over your head? the reality just doesn’t seem conducive to life being special enough to override the choice to end it, from my perspective."
SuicideWatch,fcy3nd4,t3_ej7gus,1578074350.0,"dude i could have written this myself these are all of my exact thoughts. it doesn’t make sense because people say it’s unhealthy when you live for someone else, but then as soon as you’re like, well okay then i’m going to choose not to live - for myself, but then that’s supposedly not reasonable either."
SuicideWatch,fcy2auh,t3_ej9sz2,1578073832.0,Is it frasier? Frasier was a big emotional crutch for me and now i feel afraid to even watch tv because nothing else is so low triggering of intrusive thoughts
SuicideWatch,fcy0cio,t3_ejc7er,1578072923.0,"I have this feeling near daily.

SuicideWatch,fcxu4po,t3_ejclen,1578070526.0,"just fyi being at school it’s really unlikely you’ll be left alone long enough for it to work, slitting your wrists takes a long time to bleed out, and your kitchen knife probably won’t be sharp enough and will hurt really bad"
SuicideWatch,fcx3ubf,t1_fcx0epo,1578050037.0,"this is exactly how i feel. i want to be able to do bad but i know that once i were to look down from the top of a building that i would be too fucking scared of the possible pain. the thought of ending all of this pain with an extreme concentration of pain just sounds god awful. i thought about getting in my car in the garage but that would fuck my mom so much, the car i use is hers and she’d never be able to touch it again but she wouldn’t be able to afford a new one either. i feel all of these responsibilities to her financially but i feel like that’s just not fair to myself, to remain a slave just so she can also be a slave? i want to die more than ever but i’ve created so many responsibilities in my life that now it’s not just emotionally selfish, it’s practically selfish as well and that makes me resent life even more.

edit- i just got the automated message, don’t know if i was too explicit or not about methods, mods, i’ll edit if so"

OCD,fcm53nw,t3_ehp3wl,1577764466.0,"Prozac has always helped me the most with the most mild zany-feeling out of the main ones. 

I paired it with Seroquel xr for a while and regularly took temazepam or xanax and that was probably the best set up, but i was left with absolutely no sex drive unless i’d taken a benzo, and even then only if i could manage to stay awake after all that."

How do you reconcile this with the idea of memory though? what are memories if not thoughts?"
spirituality,fcbal2e,t1_fcb80q3,1577584515.0,Thank you for pointing that out. All of the mental health issues i’ve dealt with all basically point to a thought disorder. I have a hard time realizing when I’m circling.

I just realized it a couple of weeks ago. I guarded my heart off and ignored it in the name of self love but I was only pushing away the things that made my heart feel in any way that wasn’t just praising me. I’m really hoping the connection is as real as I know it to be, but this trap has my life in flames right now."

If you explain to her that the trees and earth and fresh air help her release stagnant feelings and energy and to just give it a few shots to see how it feels she may be interested. Don’t make it seem like something she’ll have to do forever, but just something to try to see how it works for her."

Meditation,fc1ifyf,t3_efn44m,1577319735.0,"Oh my god. I’m right in the thick of this experience right now. For at least a year I was 99% plant based, heavily focused on spirituality and feeling energetically pure, but then life got chaotic and my motivation went down the drain, the holidays arrived and I started eating all of the very not plant based treats, and my emotional state is the worst it’s been in at least five years. Everything spiritual feels like utter bullshit, I feel like i’m condemning that side of myself for thinking things could be that easy, but at the same time I know i’m being overrun by my thoughts. Meditating feels impossible because it will only dredge up the mass amount of black thoughts my mind finds that render me incapable of carrying on. I guess this is a dark night of the soul? Sheesh it’s rough. I’ve spent the past 72 hours basically in bed, a very merry christmas."

it’s like how confidence turns uncomfortable situations into things that don’t feel so bad because you let it roll off and be meaningless. everything in your reality with meaning is meaning that you choose for it to have."
HumanDesignSystem,fbx5els,t1_fbx45oj,1577170095.0,"yes, because as an emotional generator you aren’t a “pure generator”. a pure generator is sacral authority, whereas your solar plexus is your authority. (that’s my impression-i’m not super well versed in HD but i’m very interested in it and spend a lot of time reading the free info i can find online) but to be honest so much of HD is realizing where the conditioning you’ve had your whole life is. i’m an ego manifestor, so basically my aligned self is designed to be “selfish” but the way i interpret it is that i can be selfish in my desire to put love above everything. so it’s not necessarily an “ego” based compulsion. a lot of HD is also really confusing due in part to the wording. it’s very scroll-like and mystical which can be difficult to translate when most people have he vocabulary of modern psychology as the language they use to define the way they think, feel, and act, so there’s a bit of a disconnect to begin with."
