videos,ffeecst,t3_ess6vn,1579844862.0,"One thing that usually gets lost is that this is less corruption than a result of Supreme Court rulings allowing lethal force by police if they merely perceive a threat (which is completely subjective).  This means if a cop shoots someone, all they need to say is they felt threatened and bam they are innocent, which is why DAs often don’t bother bringing charges for cases that to an average person look like murder.

Also I think it’s important to remember the context of policing in America. There is a gun for every man woman and child out there. If your a cop in Japan or the UK, you simply don’t have to worry about a suspect shooting you. A cop in the US has to assume everyone could be armed.  Cops deal with all the shit we don’t want to: homeless encampments, mentally ill people, drug addled crazies etc.  Demonizing them is just a way not to face hard truths about our society."
travel,ffeaa37,t3_ess4oz,1579841083.0,"I had a similar experience 20 yrs ago taking a 3 week trip to Thailand. The speed and attitudes to life were so diametrically opposed to the workaholic, isolated culture in the US. When my startup went under, I moved to Bangkok to teach English and many of the flaws I didn’t see became apparent and after 6 mos I was ready to come home.

That said there is a real provincialism in America. If you are in Ohio, you can drive hours in any direction and still be in America. If you are in Europe you have dozens of countries within 2-3 hours.  Aussies and kiwis quit their jobs to travel because they are stuck on islands in the middle of the pacific. 

I think if most Americans could do a study abroad it would help our culture and politics immensely"

Does India have race riots? Yes but so do we...India could easily have ended up in a much worse position say either as a dictatorship a la China or disintegrated into separate countries instead of the world’s largest democracy...however flawed"

changemyview,ff80klv,t1_ff5smbf,1579662860.0,"I say its failed because:
1. its ruled by a megalomaniac narcissist and unlike ours, he can't be voted out
2. Human rights - saying that cuba has better LGBT rights than the US is ridiculous because theirs is on a piece of paper, a marketing ploy.  What happens in practice is entirely different - depending on cops, courts etc.  They do not have fundamental rule of law
3. Its per capita GDP has lagged far behind similar countries like Costa Rica that did not take the radical revolutionary path
4. the US embargo is a direct result of Fidel's radical revolution: the first thing he did was violate international law and seize all US assets, is someone stole your stuff, you probably wouldn't trade with them either

The nobility would lose their titles but otherwise the status quo would continue until the new democracy solidified its powerbase enough to start taxing the former aristocracy and bringing them to heel."

changemyview,ff59xd9,t1_ff56v8t,1579584690.0,"Venezuela was a radical revolution in that once Chavez was elected (as a populist demagogue - lots of those going around these days), he arrogated power and made himself essentially president for life.  He didn't make 'minor' reforms.  He nationalized entire industries and put his cronies in charge, oil production plummeted.  Ultimately, proof is in the pudding - they went from being one the richest countries in latin america to the poorest.

Ditto on Cuba."
changemyview,ff59moe,t1_ff50j0v,1579584413.0,"To a certain degree, that is exactly my point.  Radical revolutions like the French destroy societal institutions and trust and its hard to come back from that.  The American revolution mostly kept everything intact except the relationship with England while introducing a new creed of self-governance without any Monarchy."
changemyview,ff59aue,t1_ff4z440,1579584110.0,"Your making a before / after argument.  My argument is the path not taken.

Here is a thought experiment, what if instead of a radical implementation of communism and murder of the Romanoffs, the Bolsheviks had kept the Romanoffs in place as figureheads a la the Queen of England and implemented socialism while still allowing some form of democracy, dissent and dialogue?

You wouldn't have need a massive security apparatus constantly surveilling its citizens, throwing them in gulags, defections and so forth.  You still would have improved every indicator but without becoming the monstrosity that the Soviet Union ultimately became.  Yes, it would have taken longer but it would have been more stable so in the long run everyone would have been better off. 

For examples of this counterfactual just look next door - both Sweden and Norway did something like this at the turn of the century.  Keeping some of the old social institutions and democracy while implementing socialist policies."
changemyview,ff599ie,t1_ff4xdoo,1579584075.0,"They were successful radical revolutions, they were failures from the point of view that in order to maintain control they had to continually murder their own civilians, suppress dissent and impoverish their countries.

Compare either India or Malaysia with say former British colony Burma.  I'm not saying the utopias, just overall better outcomes.  

Obviously these are all generalizations, the underlying point is that Nelson Mandela tried, whereas Mugabe in Zimbabwe did not."
