It's a ""1960s superhero women problem.""

Basically, new female superheroes in the 1960s couldn't do things like use brute force or physical violence. So they ""nerfed"" them with things like mental powers or shields or other soft type powers.

But then the 1970s hit and new writers realized that those ""soft powers"" were actually underutilized and started to ratchet the powers up to full power. So instead of just ""gently pushing"" people away in fights, Sue Storm was suddenly whaling on bad guys with invisible rail gun ballistics.

It's why many of those women went from ""group mom"" to ""super overpowered"" in less than 10 years."

AskHistorians,ff1emt1,t3_er02j0,1579478230.0,"
I've found that, historically, a lot of political groups and activists were controlled by upper class men who had the advantages of schooling, economic levels, and higher class distinction. Much of the African American abolitionists and civil rights groups were dominated by upper class African American men in the leadership positions whether they were lawyers, teachers, administrators, preachers, and so on, and that even carried down to community levels. They often times get the most credit and history, but not always (especially when it comes to the abolitionist movement).

For Brown vs. BoE, that fight had been controlled by decades by men in Topeka with school administrators, journalists, and lawyers within the African American community itself. They often controlled the political machinations and decisions regardless of how others felt or others' needs.

The school administrators and lawyers were the ones to focus solely on schooling for children while basically torpedoing teachers and support staff at the black schools while also ignoring/underplaying labor issues in the community. (I am severely truncating this whole history here).

It should also be noted that Topeka itself was rare in that the local high schools were integrated, but the elementary/junior high schools were not. On top of that, many elementary schools sometimes flip fopped. First they were integrated, then segregated, then reintegrated.


Here's a picture of Lowman Hill Elementary School as it was integrated in the 1890s.

https://www.nps.gov/brvb/learn/historyculture/images/Lowman-Hills,-4th-Grade,-1892-(KU)_3.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false

https://www.nps.gov/brvb/learn/historyculture/topekasegregation.htm

The fight for integration went on for decades with local school  boards forcing integration just for logistics sake: 

""The school board, however, found it extremely difficult to keep up with a total student population which rose from 6,216 to 13,811 in the years between 1908 and 1924. [9] Under the existing conditions, the school board found it impossible to create a dual school system that met the requirements set forth in the Plessy decision. In 1924, when white parents demanded that the African American children at Gage Park School be removed “and sent to some other school,” the board refused giving as their reason “the colored schools are as badly overcrowded as the white schools” and the transfer of the students would place an undue burden on the black schools. [10]"" 


There are actual meeting minutes archived in the Kansaspedia website (The Kansas History Museum's online archives) that talk about the history of this very discussion. Administrators and lawyers deliberately ignored teachers and other workers by focusing solely on students and children being granted desegregation. 

In Topeka, it took years for Topeka schools to start accepting these teachers into the integrated, formally ""white"" schools- some becoming incredibly popular later on. But many of those teachers ended up moving away to more welcoming states like California.


https://www.nps.gov/brvb/learn/historyculture/topekasegregation.htm

A lot of African American families did not want integreation specifically, because they knew that teachers and staff would be fired and leave their kids vulnerable to hostile or negligent teachers without help from inside sources.

""At the same time, the Topeka Council of Parents and Teachers took a determined stand against “abolishing segregated schools if such a move meant abolishing our own teacher’s jobs.” Addressing the school board, the group, representing all four of the city’s black schools protested “we fail to see how children can be inspired to get an education if we continually do away with the jobs they can fill after securing their education,” advising the board that no support for integration would be forthcoming until some proof was provided “that our children would do as well and be as happy as they are now.” [25]""

https://www.nps.gov/brvb/learn/historyculture/topekasegregation.htm



Also as an aside, Topeka High School was integrated as a school, but segregated for sports and activities. The student who almost single handedly desegregated the school for basketball was none other than Dean Smith. His father had desegregated the sports programs in the school he had coached, and Dean later challenged the whole system based on his experiences with his dad.

> Culture rarely is generated out of a vacuum, it most commonly advances out of hybridization of native and foreign elements, and the only cultures that aren't ""guilty"" of borrowing elements from others are a few remaining hunter gatherer groups.

Anthropologist here.

That's not how culture works. Cultures don't ""advance,"" they just are.

The vast majority of different cultures were built through local communities, beliefs, and inter-generational teachings/education.

It's not rare for different cultures to meet and interact, but ""global interaction"" on any real fast level (faster than foot/some animal migration) has only really existed for about 500-ish years.

But that doesn't exclude more localized (even intercontinental level) interactions through migration, religion, empire building, exploration, especially trade, or just different groups living near each other that can be wildly different or wildly similar.

The thing about cultural appropriation is that a lot of it has to do 
 people frustrated with costuming and ""borrowing"" entire looks or fashion styles that were ripped off from their own group and then used to promote a different group- but only on a superficial level.  

A lot of those styles have some very deep meanings and prohibitions on who can wear something and for what reason. 

Feather headdresses are a good example. It might take a person 10 years of hard work to obtain the ability to wear something, and then some schmuck just picks up a copy, wears it around, and throws it away. Think of it as the fashion version of calling oneself a doctor or a soldier when one actually isn't. People would think it would be weird (and illegal in some cases) for some random guy to go around saying ""Yeah, call me 'Doctor Mike' today"" in scrubs and wearing a stethoscope and name badge saying he's ""Doctor Mike.""

And its especially egregious for many when it's commodified by the fashion industry where they'll steal entire methods, styles, patterns, looks, slap a $800 price tag on something they didn't create in the first place, not pay anything to the original creators, and then move onto the next big ethnic ""look"" that they can steal.

It's not just about ""oh, we all beg, borrow, and steal each others looks."" It's that many people in different cultures (no, not all people and not cultures) get frustrated when people wear their own clothes (or full on racist caricatures) without permission or without understanding what it actually means to those who actually wear those clothes and have certain taboos and the like.

You ever wonder how they got into the Great Pyramid?

They blew that shit up. 

With dynamite.

""Vyse's ""gunpowder archaeology"" made one highly notable discovery in the Great Pyramid of Giza. Giovanni Battista Caviglia had blasted on the south side of the stress-relieving chamber (Davison's Chamber) on top of the King's Chamber, a chamber discovered by Nathaniel Davison in 1765, hoping to find a link to the southern air channel. But while Caviglia gave up, Vyse suspected that there was another chamber on top of Davison's Chamber, since he could insert a reed ""for about two feet"" upwards through a crack into a cavity.[18] He therefore blasted straight up on the northern side, over three and a half months, finding four additional chambers. Vyse named these chambers after important friends and colleagues; Wellington's Chamber (Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington), Nelson's Chamber (Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson), Lady Arbuthnot's Chamber (Anne Fitzgerald, wife of Sir Robert Keith Arbuthnot, 2nd Baronet) and Campbell's Chamber (Patrick Campbell, the British agent and Consul General in Egypt).[19]""

Anthropology,fef4q87,t1_fef3mp0,1579048133.0,"You keep thinking of hunting as ""big game"" hunting. My whole and entire original point is that there are different types of hunting from  megafauna to smaller prey. The history hunting spans everything from taking down elephants to elk to fish to rabbits to termites. Women and even children actively engaged in hunting at times, not just women dragging children out to take down a hippo.

""Hunters"" are not just people who go out on long expeditions, but also include those out hunting smaller scale prey.

You keep wanting to invoke biology, but it's way more complicated and wider spanning than how you're making out to be."
