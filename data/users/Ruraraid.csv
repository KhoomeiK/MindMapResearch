My favorite one which I saw on the local news had a story about a woman who dialed 911. She was telling the dispatcher that she was trying to order a pizza which at first the dispatcher treated it as a prank.

Resistance - Kind of hard to make a shooter appealing these days in the shadow of the CoD and Battlefield juggernauts. Now for Resistance the franchise didn't do quite that well in its last outing so I wouldn't expect a sequel.

Killzone - Similar situation to the aformentioned Resistance game but I feel like it would be worse off since its story was well...not great to begin with.

PS All-Stars - This game had a lot of promise but didn't get the backing it needed and was always sitting in the shadow of Nintendo's juggernaut Super Smash Bros franchise. I think bringing it back would be a waste as there is a better albeit pipe dream option. What I mean by that is I wish the industry would just get together and share the dev cost of Super Smash bros. In doing so they can make it so every platform can have its own unique version and all 3 platforms can trade characters so that each one has a unique roster.

Infamous - All 3 Infamous games over the years have been fairly fun open world games that are easy pick up and play games with a decent story...that sometimes can go to shit. That said I think this is one of the more viable options these days since open world games are the norm.

Heavenly Sword - Many seem to have enjoyed this but I found it to mostly be a fairly mediocre game.

Twisted Metal - The last game in the franchise was...well pretty bad and was very VERY quickly forgotten by most people.

I honestly think the biggest brick wall we face when getting the planet to go entirely green is the fact govt's and big oil don't want to pay the up front cost for going green. The long term benefits HEAVILY outweigh the financial cost because you can make a ton of energy off hydroelectric, wing, geothermal, etc. Hell even the Fusion reactor program in the EU is on track to potentially have promising results towards solving energy demands outright with its only byproduct being helium."

news,ffjb2a9,t1_ffi5wug,1579994555.0,I've hardly ever found Buzzfeed to be a good news source and Buzzfeed in general has done some sketchy shit. Feel free to jump down that Buzzfeed rabbit hole sometime and see for yourself.
AskReddit,ffj8w79,t3_etohsu,1579993220.0,"Movies using guns in general as I see sooooo many realism errors with gun safety and how they mechanically operate. I'm a gun owner myself and huge history buff so the safety and mechanicaly errors in films bother me and are impossible to ignore.

The triggering thing is when some idiot sees a gun being used they automatically think they know how to handle a gun. A coupole of times this leads to a ""that asshole"" situation at the range waiting to get punched in the face when he nonchalantly points his gun away from the range when turning around.

As for the mechanical side of things it ALWAYS bothers me when I see guns shooting well beyond their ammo capacity without reloading, a gun being fired without ever chambering the first round, firing when the gun has already been shown to be empty."

Those types make me glad we had this funny female cashier with a great sense of humor who liked playing as our own Karen. She made it her goal in life to fuck with the Karens in ever so subtle passive aggressive ways. If she was working and anyone got a Karen we would call for a bathroom break. Now in reality we were switching registers with her so we could get some quality entertainment while she took the karens down a notch.

I later found out after I left that she became a store manager which had me in tears picturing the Karens calling for the manager only to get her."
