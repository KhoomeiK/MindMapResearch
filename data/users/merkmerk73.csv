You can visit some other areas temporarily, but the reality is folks like the fantasy settings the best

But I don't think that matters - we won't see a pillars 3 anytime in the next 5 years.

Deadfire bombed hard. I love Deadfire and think it's just an amazing game, but it did unbelievably poorly - and it's because folks were just not that nuts about Pillars 1 even tho they bought it."

Almost everyone was shitting on this game everywhere - especially on subs other than this one 

Everyone expected it to be some boring shooter and a complete turd

The multiplayer piece came out and folks didn’t care for it and it spiraled even worse from there 

Then the campaign came out and folks like totalbiscuit put out videos saying “uh... this is really awesome and fun”

I remember certain shitholes like something awful were filled with people accusing others of being shills when they said the game was awesome because the ship was taking a while to right itself

Take out a pod, move up just a tad and trigger outsiders.

Rocket wide, doesn't blow cover, people low roll or miss so outsiders just regen health, outsider friends show up - full squad wipe even with attempting to make it to LZ

After reviewing losses, there was too much equip and too many ranks lost. I know in theory LW allows you to lose missions - but you really can't have a full squad wipe this early because you delay your squad size 8 upgrade, and losing my laser sniper / rifles / auto / scopes etc. was just too much.

I want to play again but LW is just so exhausting. Up until this point was probably 50 missions, some of them nail biting overwatch camping slogs. Managing such a large barracks is probably the worst part of LW - I think WOTC probably got it right where you have a large roster but not so many troops that they lose their sense of personality (By this point in LW I have minimum 4 of every class and 5 of some)
