In an Arizona/California summer, setting the a/c to 78 feels GREAT, nice and cold. Anything lower is freezing.

Now in the winter putting the heater on 70-72 feels good, anything higher and you're sweating. Body adapts

news,fg2tlhb,t1_fg2qpo2,1580455350.0,"Damn first comment in last 5 years and even back then you were adamant on this issue. You definitely got me thinking in another light - the part that gets me is that while one may not have acted on the ""urges"", lots of them have and/or will in the future. It's hard not to wanna strangle somebody who has/could have potentially done that, if I was a psychiatrist and someone revealed that to me, I'd assume they did it before and why would I want to help someone like that? it's hard to think of the big picture is what I'm saying. 

No one wants to be even remotely known for what people will see as helping/sympathizing/supporting anything to do with those people, that's just how the world is right now whether you're smart dumb left right good bad young old. Maybe it will change in the future"

todayilearned,fe9khw6,t1_fe6phnu,1578938664.0,"You're completely right. Although aborting the suicide attempt was not the ""pussying out"" part (and excuse my choice of words), to me the chickening out part was when he decided he is not only gonna take his own life, he is going to make other people have to suffer from the event as well.   


He may not have intended for other people to die with him but you'd have to be a moron to think nobody else could potentially be critically injured in a damn train crash. Best case scenario you potentially scar the conductor for life and anyone around while also inconveniencing hundreds if not thousands of people. That is the ""chickening out"" part.  I get that mental health is not that simple but I'm also not gonna sympathize with some moron who caused over 100 people to not go home to their families that night. I was not even double digits and I remember watching the aftermath live on tv.

todayilearned,fe6579g,t1_fe60b9u,1578882041.0,"... what? am I misunderstanding something here or what. I don't think anyone was suggesting that being in a car while it's hit wouldn't work. The idea is that using your car as a blockade to a train is even more incredibly selfish than just jumping infront with only your body.   


Trains don't typically derail themselves because they see something up on the road... they usually get derailed when they hit something, like in the scenario posted above. The guy survived because he pussied out and left his car on the tracks while he ran away."
