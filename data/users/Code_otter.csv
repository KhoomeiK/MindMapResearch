I used a dog walking service with my last dog when I traveled on business. Came in real handy having someone already lined up when I broke my foot."

AnimalsBeingJerks,fe4ibxe,t1_fe4e7iq,1578859583.0,"I read somewhere that cats don't have a sense of the sweet taste...or at least it's not as strong as it is in humans and dogs. Apparently their smelling and tasting senses are focused on meat meat meat fish and meat.

Since a proper bolognese is basically meat in beef broth (with seasoning, veggies, tomatoes, and white wine thrown in) it makes sense that cats would be drawn to it. Plus cats are weird and they often have one non-animal based food that they love."

trashy,fcbvnl6,t1_fcal5f8,1577591477.0,If it’s a seasonal job there is basically no risk. Amazon won’t notify the police (at least not usually) and the guy doesn’t have more than another few days left in the gig anyway. Worst case he can’t get rehired next year but even that isn’t a deal killer since Amazon uses so many subcontractors for delivery.
