todayilearned,ffgsbms,t1_ffeu5xe,1579913795.0,"It's still that way. Seeking treatment for mental health issues can result in a loss of freedom as well as a loss of freedoms/privileges in society, including certain jobs.

So instead of seeking treatment, people just try to hold it together. One example, in Canada is that people who are being treated for depression aren't supposed to hold Possession/Acquisition Licenses (gun permits), or have any firearms. So for a person who has firearms, it's either keep the guns or get help. Does it sound reasonable to you to provide such a huge disincentive to seeking proper treatment? Remember that it's not like strangers can diagnose you, doctors can't just diagnose you with depression against your will, you have to want/seek help. But people have jobs that they can lose by seeking help, *so they don't*.

Just like pedophiles don't seek help because they could end up exposed.

Just like people don't skip work due to an illness if they stand to lose wages by staying home.

Seeking help promises nothing, but risks real things that people hold dear (like guns, employment, freedom, and money)."

Without the corruption in the DNC (if you didn't see it in 2016, you were a cave-dweller), Bernie Sanders would have likely won both the nomination and the Presidency.

Bernie Sanders is leading the Dem race today, and most of his supporters believe he would have won in 2016.

In my opinion, the Democrats threw 2016 to Trump because they were terrified that a Socialist grassroots movement would overthrow their Centrist Party. Democratic corruption is absolutely harming the United States, by transparently favoring centrists over socialists and leftists, and losing winnable elections to the elephants."
