AskParents,fexj61a,t3_eqnmxw,1579431849.0,Sounds like you're doing a great job! You should look into continuum style parenting and Jean leidloff's book. It sounds like it would be right up your street :)

AskParents,femqv8t,t1_felc8sj,1579266965.0,No thanks. I don't really care. Just wanted to call you out on your bullshit. Hope you find the attention you are looking for.
AskParents,fekuas9,t3_epoo4g,1579207746.0,The amount of drugs you do (according to your profile) is probably what's going to fuck up your education...
AskMenAdvice,fehh1eq,t1_feg9rk7,1579116370.0,"You're not 'participating' in anything. You can say ""I need help. My boyfriend hits me and I need help getting out of this relationship'"

AmItheAsshole,fdq6g7h,t3_emeiv3,1578656929.0,"I'm maybe going against the grain here
NAH people do some crazy fucked up stuff when they're preggers! Hormones are weird! It's not ok but it doesn't make her an asshole imo
You're not an asshole, but you could be more sensitive to her crazy behaviour, as hard as that is! 
Story: when I was pregnant with my second I craved mushy peas. Hubby went to chippy to get some and came back without the peas!! I cried."

AskMenAdvice,fca32us,t3_egup9h,1577562365.0,"If you guys are serious about being together, you need to make an effort to not let past experiences affect your relationship.
'A negative thought enters your mind' learn to replace it with a positive one about how amazing your current situation is. 
Over time, people from the past will mean less to you !"
AskMenAdvice,fc7qlyx,t1_fc7kfdb,1577516133.0,"Assuming that the first conversation goes well,and she doesnt feel like you sexually assaulted her.. i would follow it with 'i really value your friendship, i dont know what id do without you at work! I dont want to do anything that cpuld jeopardise our relationship' thats probably enough to start with.
Me and my husband have been through some shitty stuff in the past, here are a few boundaries that we have put in place over the years.
We dont get drunk with work collegues.
We dont go on work trips with collegues of the opposite sex (doesnt sound possible in your job, but maybe you could agree not to share room numbers, or only meet in public spaces)
We call home every day at least once."
AskMenAdvice,fc6r7c8,t3_egho3x,1577487413.0,"If you're worried and she's such a good friend, then ask her. Apoligise for your part in what happened and then really listen to her response.
Also, maybe conisder creating some better boundaries between you and co-worker. And consider if there is something lacking in your marriage. This whole thing screams  'affair waiting to happen'."
askwomenadvice,fbxdsib,t3_eeu8o6,1577182052.0,"Is there anyway of taking him down? I know you said there is nothing the poluce can do, but arent there revenge porl laws? Or even laws against distribution of pornography? 
Also, please dont blame yourself! You did your best and thats amazing!!"
