cats,fgnu2h8,t1_fg97d5i,1580952916.0,"I like to remind them about arsenic and hemlock. Then I send them the MSDS for whatever essential oil they are saying is soooo safe. It usually has warnings about skin contact and inhalation, and very helpfully breaks down the chemical compounds (by name!) found in the essential oil--yes, the ""100% pure"" and ""therapeutic grade"" oils too!"
cats,fgnttf1,t1_fg88mfh,1580952758.0,"Doesn't matter if the essential oils are mixed with sketchy stuff or super duper pure, they still have compounds that are hazardous to cats (and people too...but everyone seems to think ""all natural"" means ""safe""). You can do a search for the MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) for any specific oil and see."
