What one has to remember for all physical endeavors is why they are there. If you're a professional athlete then there's some argument for abusing your body as much as possible to stay at the top for as long as possible to get that check. If, however, you're in it to stay healthy, then please... for the love of all things good and pure... don't do stupid shit.

Full power kicking into the air will screw up your joints, eventually. Same for any full power technique into the air. Most conditioning, but namely looking to create micro-fractures in bone to harden them, is more stupid shit.

For the record, I'm 80kg and Master Bower is 125kg.

Watch the videos and take note how the measurement is done. Mine in particular (which was shot for the board breaker test rather than the technique, guldernit) you'll see that I measure with my foot just in front of the board's surface. I do this intentionally as I know I'll be just short (as the target in to the surface of the back board), so I have to project (rotate) my hip completely into the technique in order to get the extra 5cm / 1.5"" of penetration and make the break.

You want to have as much meat and bone behind the technique as possible, so your heal, knee, hips, lead and training shoulders, head/chin and fists should all be in a line. A lot of people tend to ""banana bend"" at the hips which results in the hips and/or the shoulders being out of alignment and therefore the push back you get form the boards flows into this weak spot rather than into the ground through your base foot.

I'm personally not a fan of a full step through as the measurement is more difficult to keep consistent (due to the step) but others have made this work and it is more powerful. You also want to aim for the middle left or right of the board (so middle from top/bottom but to one side left to right). It's easier to break when you're off center just a bit (10-15% or so) because the board will break to the near side then out the far side.

It would be most helpful to see a video of a board break attempt to give you specific pointers, but there's some general tips and tricks! For a single board of 300mm \* 300mm \* 19mm (12"" \* 12"" \* 3/4"") it's definitely doable! Board breaking is much maligned in other arts but I don't mind it's ability to determine if you are focusing you're power and properly orchestrating your movements as ultimately that the secret with all breaking."
