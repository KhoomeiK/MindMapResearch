oddlysatisfying,ffii3dv,t1_ffhxhu6,1579974393.0,What? No you don't? I've always kept mine and they just pull out around.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffhvs96,t1_ffhglbq,1579956167.0,Probably one of Ba'al. You know he sent a couple clones down there to try to take over Aus.
HistoryMemes,ffcye27,t1_ffcserm,1579809830.0,"That sounds great. Too bad in the US the government is often more concerned with preventing people from voting by throwing up roadblocks everywhere. No offense, but the situation here is vastly different than those countries you're talking about because the government actually makes an effort. 

The states with the biggest issues largely intentionally make it difficult for poor people to vote, because they don't want them to have the ability to vote for their own best interests. It's extensively documented in the US and bringing up other countries where the situation is different is ridiculous."
HistoryMemes,ffcmx6j,t1_ffcijef,1579802857.0,"Lol wtf.... Getting copies of documents of any kind costs money and time, two things poor people ain't got. Getting evicted and all your original documents being lost is not an uncommon sight when you're broke as fuck. There area million reasons why it's hard to get documentation, and most of them revolve around how much of a PITA it is to replace them."
HistoryMemes,ffchws7,t1_ffcb0bv,1579799822.0,"I think the objection to voter id laws is more about how to get an ID you have to pay money and jump through a ton of hoops, which disadvantages poor people and minorities. If everyone was issued a voter ID when they registered to vote there wouldn't be a complaint."
HighQualityGifs,ffch6wv,t1_ffbzytx,1579799383.0,"It's one of the greatest scifi shows out there, not just ""pretty good"". Tons of fun and not nearly as dated as you would think considering it's age."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ff5sivo,t3_errt8w,1579608588.0,"Does your husband know? Because that's kinda important. I'm sure he's feeling out in the cold and doesn't get why.

I told my SO when we'd been dating a few months, and it was good for us because he gets it now when I complain how pretty girls are. But then again, I've never not been attracted to him, just that sometimes it wanes in favor of women."
MadeMeSmile,ff0v1r4,t1_ff0c4zc,1579472546.0,"Eh, it really honestly depends. If you're a sex worker who caters to a higher end of clientele you're able to be selective and maybe you do only pick the guys you wanna have sex with. But at the end of the day, it's not really about sex. Like, even if it's someone you 100% don't wanna have sex with, you're benefitting from it. You can choose to say no, but you're saying yes because you want to, because there is a benefit for you (money). It's like going out for a night with your friends even though you're exhausted because you wanna see them. Maybe you don't wanna do it, but there is a benefit that makes you do it, and you choose that benefit. I think it just feels weird because it's about sex and we attach so much to sex. Just like rape is about power, sometimes sex work is just about money.

All that is just my understanding from talking to assault victims, sex workers etc. I've never been in those shoes before but it's my understanding."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fer7499,t1_fer4qsg,1579350612.0,"Oh damn, that's literally the only reason why some women have babies cause that shit suuuuucks"
MadeMeSmile,fer5yry,t1_fer4exf,1579350274.0,"Not OP but think of it like this

If you think about assault and the definition of sex work it makes sense. Assault is having your consent, your boundaries, your humanity essentially ripped away from you by someone else. It's sexual, yeah, but it's about the violation. 

Sex work(if you're choosing to do it) allows you 100% to choose everything. It's consent and boundaries on steroids in a way. As long as you have something backing you up, you get control back over yourself, your body, your situation. It's the ultimate control of your body, in a sense. So that can be valuable if you've been made to feel like you no longer have control over your body."
AskReddit,fech3o3,t1_feaeoq8,1578973772.0,"Ha, this reminded me of the big Christmas snow in 2003. But since you mention school I'm guessing it was the 2017 snow? We didn't get too much where I am but certainly a few places got a foot. It was great."
personalfinance,fdraujn,t1_fdr9ip8,1578681879.0,"Where did I say that the only reason wages plummet is because women join? I simply said that when women DO join in large numbers, there is a pretty clear change that happens. Don't argue against a straw man."
personalfinance,fdr8e3r,t1_fdqswx3,1578680922.0,"Except that even when women start to choose higher paying and traditionally male careers those careers suddenly plummet in how much they pay people.

It's really not as simple as ""well women just pick poorly paying careers"""
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdqvmle,t1_fdqqibd,1578675562.0,"They don't want the protection. They don't have a choice in it: it's law that they have to have it.

And the cottage was already slated for expensive restoration since, yknow, it's an old as fuck building. The taxpayers(well, the crown, but sure, if you're gonna say taxpayers) pays for renovations on all the major Crown properties, including everything at Windsor. It would have been renovated and paid for if there was never a Megan Markle.

I'm far from sitting here adoring the Royal Family or anything, but by God it's incredible how the talking points drummed up by the tabloids get repeated over and over with zero fact checking."
todayilearned,fcuqzhc,t1_fcupoi6,1577986727.0,"Yeah, honestly Stargate had some of the best character developments I've seen in a long time. Not DS9 but still excellent TV. Daniel is a perfect example."
todayilearned,fcun7e2,t1_fcumk2a,1577984594.0,"Yep, Shanks was hot from the get-go but the wanted him to be nerdy and more like Spader's Jackson, hence the long hair, baggy clothes, etc. Once the show had its legs under it then he was able to make Daniel Jackson his own character. And it made sense for him to harden up some."
todayilearned,fcucjlj,t1_fcub4mp,1577977781.0,"Yeah.... RDA had some health scares after he left SG1 and had pretty classic steroid bloat in SGU's premiere if I remember correctly. It's not that he ""got fat""."

todayilearned,fcu6egq,t1_fcu5tnf,1577973661.0,It's no longer in development. Thank GOD.

scifi,fcnodkh,t1_fcmev5b,1577815332.0,After rewatching I feel like the first episode is very meh on the first watch and then one of the best on the rewatch because it's all got heavier meaning now.
funny,fciurss,t1_fciox1t,1577670299.0,I have the Venu and I love it! Got it on sale for the same price as the vivioactive which was cool.
