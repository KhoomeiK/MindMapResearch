HongKong,ffp8oe4,t1_ffnp7q4,1580088968.0,Because he really doesn't give a shit. Sorry to disappoint you but people's well being is not his priority. CCP is all about power and conquer. They'll kill their own citizens if that's what it takes.
videos,ffk5nqs,t1_ffk41an,1580016668.0,I was reading all these comments feeling concern until I read yours. Made me literally lol.
AmItheAsshole,ffgm29d,t3_etbpzi,1579909382.0,"OP, NTA. That's really frickin gross. Even as a female I would never want to witness my mom do a strip dance. You really can't let her manipulate you into such a ridiculously uncomfortable request. One or both of you could end up mentally scarred. Perhaps your mom is going through a mid life or just simply needed to be reminded that she is beautiful. Take her shopping or get a head-to-toe makeover, but for the love of god, anything but striptease!!"
vancouver,ffdvao3,t1_ffcxguu,1579829812.0,"Seriously, after encountering a certain amount of people within your life time, you'll realize hygiene isn't everyone's forte. Not to mention the internet has shown me there are lots of strange and unsanitary people out there. I don't really want to touch a book that  has been collecting poo residue cause I'm pretty sure people would often like to read sitting on the toilet."
vancouver,ffdt2tz,t3_eszg2q,1579828230.0,I started reading the title genuinely wanting to know good a florist and ended up snorting with laughter.
aww,ff9kpfa,t3_esc0t4,1579715045.0,Lol reminds me of this [scene](http://rebloggy.com/post/drugs-channing-tatum-21-jump-street-are-you-on-drugs-johna-hill/19860223704) from 21 jump street.
funny,ff7szsa,t1_ff7lpun,1579657627.0,"Oh gawd, I see this everywhere when I travel. 80% of the time they're Russians who dresses exactly like this girl here. Hair down to the waist, fitted shirt, high rise. They would jump over barriers and stand on top of famous structures while other people are actually trying to appreciate these centuries old monuments. Usually there's some dude tagging along taking copious amount of pictures of them in different poses. It's just pure cringe combine with obnoxiousness."
YelpDrama,femgm6r,t3_edxnrp,1579254481.0,Well she didn't really mention which night she visited the restaurant
DiWHY,fejana9,t3_epflug,1579164395.0,Is this a parody? They're all hilariously stupid. That coffee table with holes is the worst idea ever.
vancouver,fehctj6,t3_ep5u6k,1579113915.0,The problem is some people are just way too oblivious to realize how their careless behavior could impact other people are around.
vancouver,fehb9pr,t3_ep4ipd,1579113002.0,When I was living in Coquitlam I saw a guy ice skating down the road one year. It was glorious.
AnimalsBeingBros,fefh24f,t1_fef6nm5,1579056167.0,"Oh well since the koala didn't get burnted alive, let's drown him instead"

knitting,febrx7c,t3_eobhjx,1578961964.0,Bahaha I love this so much!! His little legs! ðŸ˜‚ Great job!
flexibility,fe1dynf,t3_enjw49,1578825506.0,Aaaahh I didn't think it's possible to deepthroat and sit on your own head at the same time.
ChoosingBeggars,fdyoy22,t1_fdw9tl7,1578782122.0,I feel sorry for your best friend. I assume he's gonna have to deal with this dick at every family gathering for the rest of his life from now on.
ChoosingBeggars,fduc0bg,t1_fdu60al,1578730938.0,What happened at the at the wedding??
WatchandLearn,fdps1il,t3_emduco,1578638275.0,"Oh good, now my friends can know I'm an alcoholic when they come over."
aww,fdkluzb,t1_fdkcwuz,1578506240.0,"Haha, maybe because he could be an Australian Shepherd?"
aww,fdkllta,t1_fdkjaq2,1578506086.0,Is it kinda like how they say sociopaths can make good surgeons cause they could perform without fear as they don't carry any emotions or empathy for their patients. Wonder if dogs could be sociopaths.
ChoosingBeggars,fddbfra,t3_ekmyiy,1578304002.0,Kinda annoying how they threatened to fire you all because you were trying to keep their business from regularly getting robbed by this lady.
FuckYouKaren,fcv3fmd,t3_eixslk,1577993845.0,Horrifying!! ðŸ˜±
tifu,fcrox3a,t3_eiht41,1577904654.0,So sorry to hear that. Like the others have said it happens to most men. Even my 30 year old ex bf. I didn't know better and made it about me and thought I wasn't attractive enough. But it just ended up giving him more anxiety and had even a harder time because of the pressure I was putting on him. I think you're handling it well and hopefully she'll understand.
PublicFreakout,fbx7s3f,t1_fbx6vek,1577173173.0,Yeah right? I mean she's fighting a goddamn gate.
