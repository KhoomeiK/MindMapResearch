canada,ff8eeix,t1_ff80bza,1579674966.0,"I target shoot--and I own my guns rather than renting them for the same reason that anyone who is even moderately serious about a sport owns their gear rather than rents.  I know my handguns are well taken care of, and they'll be as I left them when I come back to them.

dndnext,ff85ypo,t3_es2wsk,1579666922.0,"> In all the boardgame nights we played he never once read any rules or watched any videos I sent him to prepare, claiming he dislikes preparing in that way since it reminds him of homework (we're all in our late 20s, early 30s so I found that remark a bit juvenile). 

""Listen, for our six hour session, I do an additional five to ten hours of prep work.  If you can't spend even one hour total on prep work for the game, that's a problem for me.""

> Add to this that he also questions anything that happens in games that doesn't go his way and demands to see proof in the rulebook that we are indeed playing correctly, and you can see why I'm a bit worried about this first session ending in disaster.

I may be too much of a lawyer, but the way I handle rule issues in game is basically with an ""Objection!"" sort of thing.  If you have an issue, you raise it, and provide a sentence or two of why it's an issue--the burden is on you, and if you can't articulate the problem, no dice.  I'll rule on the issue, and then move on--if it needs more discussion, that happens after the session.  

""The orc shaman chants, and points a bony finger at you.  Suddenly, you're not flying any more, you're falling--hard.""

""Wait, show me that in the rulebook.""

""No--if you have an issue, you should be able to tell me what the problem is.  Playing on...""

But if it's something like ""And the ogre smashes you for fourteen damage, knocking you unconscious.""

""Wait, isn't the ogre blind?""

""Right--my bad.  Rolling again for the disadvantage...""

The other thing is to remind players that DMing requires some trust--you'll work to uphold the trust, but if something is happening that they don't understand, they may need to just roll with it.  In one group I ran the line was ""Fucking transistors, man...""  This was sort of a joke about a guy trying to explain how computers worked, and getting down to knowing that the chip included a lot of transistors, but not being able to explain how exactly that made computer magic happen.  It became a useful code phrase for ""this makes sense, but I can't explain it to you now for whatever reason"".  So it'd be useful for things like:

""The scrawny peasant suddenly lunges forward, plunging a dagger into your stomach...  take 34 damage.""

""34 damage?  You said he looked like he was just barely avoiding starving to death.  What the fuck?""

""Fucking transistors, man.""

When I think about the cell phone providers, I wouldn't trust any of them not to leave me dying in a ditch if they thought it'd increase their profits for the quarter. 

How is Joe Average supposed to evaluate the relative merits of two 911 providers?  If his 911 provider is awful, he likely won't know until he's literally dying. 

Private fire departments have been tried, and were an incredible disaster. Private 911 service would have all of the same problems. 

Further, 911 service is something you definitely want to be universal. 

""911, what's the emergency?""

""There's a woman unconscious here. She's bleeding pretty badly, I think she's been stabbed.""

dndnext,feyxukc,t1_fex61xd,1579451775.0,"The thing is, when a spell means for you to be able to target like that, it specifies that specifically--see e.g. Magic Mouth, Glyph of Warding, Symbol, etc.  

Because Illusory Script doesn't say you can target like that, we can conclude that it doesn't allow it.  

Additionally, your interpretation effectively makes the spell into two spells by giving it this vast functionality that purely operates through the targeting mechanism.  That seems like the sort of thing they'd spell out directly.  

This also would force us to look at other spells and effects.  Evokers can choose creatures to be protected from their spell effects.  Can they just choose ""I protect everyone except dopplegangers"" in order to use Fireball as a Detect Doppleganger spell?  I think not.  

Nothing in the spell says that you can designate by categories, and this would *add functionality to the spell*, and I don't really think you can do that by claiming an omission where, when they do spell that out specifically where you can do it."

I don't see this working by RAW.  You designate creatures that are exempted--you have to designate the specific creatures, not types.  ""To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text.""
