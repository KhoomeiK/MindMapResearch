offmychest,fcsw0rz,t3_e3phvs,1577926538.0,"2019 sounded terrible. I've dealt with anxiety and depression but nothing remotely close to what you have been through. I can only wish you the best of luck with everything, be as strong as you can and find a therapist you like if you haven't already. Having someone to talk to to, a professional someone, can make a big difference."
