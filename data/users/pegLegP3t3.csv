varicocele,ffivg2i,t1_ffhdfl9,1579983673.0,Good luck man. What a story. I hope everything works out and you heal up. How long ago did you have the procedure?
RoastMe,ffh227m,t3_etaq04,1579921011.0,If all the typing doesn't give you carpal tunnel the repeated random handjobs you give to strangers while looking for someone to pay attention to you will.
varicocele,ffghg33,t1_ffgbisy,1579906313.0,You could get your test levels checked and go from there. I don't think it's a magic. Bullet but it's a place to start.
varicocele,ffg2ufb,t1_ffg2qfu,1579897256.0,Well I hope things are better for you now. I don't know if this will make a difference but I'm hoping it does. Do you still have anxiety?
RoastMe,fff0si3,t3_et7cnu,1579872518.0,And a pink belt in karate apparently.
RoastMe,ffcfo7f,t3_esjz7x,1579798450.0,Why don't you start lifting a fork.
RoastMe,ff9imu0,t3_es66p7,1579713813.0,Well you already got matching eyebrows so I'm not sure what else id pay to see.
RoastMe,ff5y4vy,t3_ernxxd,1579614040.0,Your eyebrow looks stupid af and your nose looks like Rocket from Guardians.
toastme,ff1io0r,t3_ekyphd,1579479827.0,You're beautiful. You can do this. Plus food is awesome.
toastme,ff1ikno,t3_ei4aw2,1579479784.0,"As crazy as it sounds, start exercising hard. Sweat. It helps."
RoastMe,fesab6u,t3_eqdsy3,1579363183.0,Hopefully it sold for enough to get your nose fixed.
RoastMe,feezrgo,t3_eoi5uc,1579044824.0,So this is what Oat scented condoms are for.
trees,fe8jmlg,t3_eo1czp,1578926865.0,Dude ... Just use an apple or another piece of fruit. This is gross.
bigdickproblems,fdce1uj,t3_ekefhj,1578272619.0,"When all else fails just start helicoptering. Eventually you'll take off and fly away, leaving all your problems behind."
RoastMe,fd2hrnj,t3_ejfrjo,1578147412.0,Do you tell first dates to cum in your good eye?
offmychest,fd2gnfs,t3_ejs1jw,1578146941.0,Good job. Don't look back
offmychest,fd2dd5s,t1_fd1ubu9,1578145589.0,Because that would cost more than 10k. It's unrealistic.
nextfuckinglevel,fcswa6t,t1_f9r5jk5,1577926726.0,Just one stair? I could do it.
RoastMe,fcsw7kq,t3_egunqg,1577926674.0,Yea... 30th birthday drinking maybe....
offmychest,fcsw0rz,t3_e3phvs,1577926538.0,"2019 sounded terrible. I've dealt with anxiety and depression but nothing remotely close to what you have been through. I can only wish you the best of luck with everything, be as strong as you can and find a therapist you like if you haven't already. Having someone to talk to to, a professional someone, can make a big difference."
