AMA,fff1v8c,t1_ffeoma0,1579873414.0,"The reason I asked is I dropped out after a year even though I graduated in the top of my class and had scholarships. I also wasn’t sure my direction either. I later had to piece my degrees together while working full time and raising my daughter as a single mother. That was over thirty years ago.  I am so glad I went back; it led to a successful career that I love. 

I’m proud that you found a mentor. Inspirational people/professors  are responsible for changing the course of so many. Pat yourself on the back!"

mildlyinteresting,ff5ghlg,t1_ff4q6ou,1579591823.0,"Thank you for answering. This is the regimen they put her on, plus using only Dove bar soap without a cloth or loofa. She has always scratched, but now it seems better. She is only 12 so it’s hard to ensure she doesn’t scratch.  I’ll pass on the cool compress idea."
