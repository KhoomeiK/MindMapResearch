dogs,ffjzx0t,t1_ffjyqia,1580011587.0,"I wouldn't take the decision so lightly and hastily, especially since the dog you have now is still very very young. It could potentially lead to Littermate Syndrome. Also Akitas are genetically predisposed for aggression. This could potentially pop up anywhere from 7 months to 3 years (young puppies are naturally very friendly). I don't know what your training experiences are, but are you equipped to deal with a very big powerful breed that could have aggressive triggers? Get another puppy now and that could be x2."
dogs,ffjyino,t3_eu185s,1580010466.0,"Firstly, don't get a second dog while the one you have now is still a puppy. Secondly, do YOU want another dog or do you think your dog wants a pal? Because people do this all the time, but reality is, you're gonna end up with two lonely dogs instead of one."
dogs,ffjqqhu,t3_etvsfy,1580004511.0,"I don't really have a favorite breed, I just love any dog that has that intelligent look on their eyes and faces while working with their humans. These breeds tend to be herding and some sporting breeds, so I guess those."

dogs,fewly43,t1_fetro3z,1579414096.0,"I think this is a good point. I've been wondering about this, so I try to spread activities out more and refrain from doing too much consecutively."
dogs,fewk4fb,t1_fevz13b,1579412354.0,"I think OP is only implying that they can be since the genetics responsible for making a dog very ""drivey"", hyper-focused, and trainable are closely linked to traits responsible for skittishness/shyness (see also GSD, border collies, aussies, etc). 

Very common in bybs since they've no regard for temperament, but I hear it can sometimes appear in even well bred lines ."
dogs,feweica,t1_fevp7dh,1579409258.0,"I'm with you. Believe it or not, I chose my current breed (aussie) solely based on my ""check boxes"" i.e. size, temperament, what I want to do with him, etc. I wasn't really a fan of their looks/aesthetics, which will sounds unbelievable to many, since they're so ""hot"" right now *because* of their looks. At the time, I was only aesthetically drawn to dogs with big prick ears and a big bushy tail (like the GSD).

At first, bonding was very slow because I had zero emotional attachment to his looks. It didn't help that young high energy puppies who don't know anything yet are giant assholes. I even posted on here for help to see if it was normal for me to think my own puppy (offspring of two GCH) is UGLY (lmfao!). 

Now, of course, think he is the MOST HANDSOMEST BEAUTIFUL CUTEST DOG EVER. I love his drop button ears and tailless butt--physical traits I never thought I'd like. His temperament, personality, drive, aligns with me so well that his physical looks have grown into my favorite.


I remember seeing a similar post on here by one of the regular posters. The Great Dane breeder had picked for her/him that was coincidently her/his least favorite color (since they match based on temperament). It is now her/his favorite color of Danes."

dogs,fee2b66,t1_fedzv2d,1579024922.0,"I was walking my dog at the park about a year ago and saw a family with a dog that basically looked like a slightly skinnier golden retriever but black. They told me he is a golden doodle. It just didn't inherit the curly coat.

I saw them again a few weeks ago, and they had another puppy with them. Another black doodle but curly coated. Guess the inconsistency of ""doodles"" didn't bother them, so they got another one. Oh well."

WTF,fe5n1w1,t1_fe5dj6i,1578871541.0,"Correct. Those ""exercise"" machines are pretty common in Korea (Dunno about this particular one). They normally have very little resistance. They are usually used by middle age and elderly while going out for a walk. Saw on Korean TV show a local ajumma resident reported similar incident to the TV show saying ""ghosts"". TV crew investigated and turns out the particular machines were shoddily installed with even lower friction than normal. A person manipulate the thing and walked away. The thing continued to swing for the next15-20 min."

The slider goes from 1 (default) to 5 (five times slower) in 0.5 increments. This works in Franchise mode, and I think, all the other modes as well. I was one of those people that really hated the fast speed so much that I held off playing. I'm really happy with the change."
