And it's not my job to teach anyone anything.  I like the weirdness which is this ancient defunct religion somehow stubbornly clinging its way into screwing up society's progress towards a more advanced frame of mind, and somehow preventing many of its followers from actually accomplishing the ideals which it espoused in the beginning.  If you wanna look at it like that, then institutional christianity's managed to shoot itself in the foot and its real position in society's been sabotaged by an influentially large chunk of its own hangers-on.  I don't think that deserves respect just because the modern world hasn't managed to shake that backwards order loose yet.  I have respect for people who find beliefs which guide them towards positive coexistence... the names/details of those beliefs are unimportant in themselves, it's the people who matter."
facepalm,fgeu6kn,t1_fgessiq,1580710141.0,"Dude, the only point I'm making is that those people said all sorts of totally random stuff along the way.  You can craft any complex theological argument you like, but there's no point in pretending that the judeochristian bible is worth any more serious attention than the greek myths or the Bhagavad Gita.  Might as well engage in a serious debate over the validity of Hermaphroditus as a singular being or the fundamental difference between sacred prostitution and profane.  Nitpicking theoretical details to push or refute a personal interpretation is pretty silly when the only useful purpose of organized religion is to give people a template through which to express themselves as better, positive members of a whole.  Nobody benefits from an approach which turns religion into some way to set some apart as being better, more holy, more sophisticated/educated, superior to anyone else."

LucidDreaming,ff46i0n,t3_ercgbj,1579556608.0,"Here's the thing: your brain is what determines your dreams.  And the brain has different mechanisms to shut off overlap between external and internal stimuli/perception.  Which is why sleep paralysis and being ""frozen/slo-mo'ed"" in dreams is a thing, your brain shuts off your links to your body so you don't hop up and walk off a ledge while you're sleeping.

Eyesight, visuals, are important in that your brain shuts off its eyeball stimulus in order to ""see"" things internally instead.  If your brain couldn't do that, then all you would ever see in dreams would be the back of your eyelids, right?  If your dreams seem dim then it's because your personal particular brain's mechanism for dealing with 'sight' is maybe a little bit clouded, maybe it's not entirely great at either replicating total internal vision or not entirely great at blocking off your ""it's DARK"" eyeball input.

One of the things a lot of people say about lucid dreaming is that things go black... this is because lucidity is an in-between state between consciousness and unconsciousness, and so sometimes your brain's wires get crossed as to where it's supposed to be getting its stimuli and imagery.

The reason why techniques may *tend* to work for people but never be a *guarantee* for everyone is that we all own different brains, and many of those brains have come up with their own ways of doing things.  Basically, everything which happens to you in dreams is completely valid and is how your brain takes care of you in your sleep.

If your brain's not great at turning up the brightness, or in forgetting that your actual eyes are closed, then you probably want to focus your pre-sleep thought patterns and concentration on exactly that.  Make something up that clicks with you.  Say, like, ""Outside eyes off, inside eyes on,"" or whatever allows you to imagine that your dreaming eyes are wide-open in a brightly-lit space.  This way you can train your brain in how better to see in your sleep."

collapse,fetzexa,t1_ferd9vq,1579381552.0,"Thank you for this.  Marx is a good solid beginning into the consideration of alienation as a sort of social caste-strata, something humans have been dealing with since essentially the first day one of us said ""I can print triangles into clay and know what they mean, so YOU go till the field.""

I think where Marx doesn't go far enough is the extremes... because are two of those, effectively, in generalization, and he primarily dealt with the larger-scale one.  Specifically, when a society becomes divided enough that the strata are entirely alienated from each other.  In this case the ones on top are happy with the injustice in their favour, and the ones on the bottom react finally to their position to the point where something clicks over and they rise up against the injustice not in their favour.  Modern history (pre-, industrial, and post-) is full of examples of the various ways we've more or less successfully tried to address this issue as a whole.  But the underlying fact of this scale is that it concerns large groups of people, who generally act as a sort of internal mitigation factor; any extremism arising from this scale is drastic but ultimately balanced into the societal whole one way or another.

The second real extreme is when you have an individual, or a *very* small group, who're so alienated and distanced that their reactions absolutely fall outside of something society can accept as a fair reaction to the circumstances.  Things like terrorism (and I have a very general definition of terrorism), school shootings, cults, the like.  Marx didn't so much address these because they're *real* aliens who no longer exist within any sort of framework whose end result might be positive towards our societal future whole.

It's true that people who see themselves in the second category, genuine aliens rather than part of an alienated class, tend to lose it in either one direction (externalized violence wherever they can find a target) or the other (internalized ""safer"" violence against themselves.)  But it's not exactly accurate to equate these individuals with something which social history bears out as a large-scale class inequality where those discriminated against at least feel they have the shared support-experience of others like themselves.  Alienation as a group and isolation as an individual aren't exactly the same thing."

fatpeoplestories,fe69uuy,t1_fe5rixr,1578885017.0,"But as you said, you didn't lose much weight in college either.  15 lbs in a year is more likely attributed to the fact that you'd started exercising when you hadn't before; you were probably still eating too much then, too.  And once your body caught up with its new exercise level, you stopped losing weight again.

Healthy food doesn't make you thin!  This is something people really commonly and incorrectly think, since we equate ""healthy"" with ""thin"".  Healthy food is better for you, and unhealthy food is worse for you, but *calories* are what determine how much fat your body stores.  You could starve to death on one unhealthy fast-food meal a week; you could weigh 300lbs on 5000 calories of fresh, whole, natural foods per day.  Healthy food isn't like medicine, and you can't get more healthy by eating more of it.

Keep track for six months of everything you put in your mouth, even the bites and nibbles and tastes which don't seem like they count (because they do; five tastes a day equals a whole extra dessert's worth of calories that you might not even realize).  Check labels and serving sizes, weigh out and portion your food, be honest with things like cheese and dressing and amount of cream in your coffee.  I guarantee you'll be surprised by how many calories you're actually taking in."
