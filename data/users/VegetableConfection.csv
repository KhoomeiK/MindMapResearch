>""We always knew they were a girl at heart growing up, because they loved dolls more than dinosaurs"", ""When I couldn't stand to wear a dress and wanted to wear jeans and have short hair I knew I was a boy"" type stuff.

Something being conclusive enough for you to ""know"" you're trans is not the same as it merely being at all indicative. Of course I'm not taking issue with anyone saying that it can be at all indicative. Liking a traditionally masculine/feminine thing is part of a greater pattern of behaviour that can indicate gender dysphoria. I don't think anyone would disagree with that.

Second example: she had different tastes to other boys, that is not the same as liking one feminine thing. It is a pattern of behaviour.

Third example: she played with Barbie dolls, that's it. She isn't saying that that caused her to realise she's trans.

Fourth example: again, knowing you're different is not the same as knowing you're trans.

MensRights,fejg75b,t1_fej9j21,1579172718.0,">It says that men are 6 times more likely to leave their spouse if the woman gets cancer.

Is this saying that a man is 6 times more likely to leave his spouse if they get cancer vs if they don't, or is it saying that a man is 6 times more like to leave a cancerous spouse than a woman is?"

There's a difference between liking something because you think it's feminine or masculine, and criticising someone for liking something which is for the ""wrong"" gender. The latter is what people took issue with in the older time of political correctness which wubby talks about."

I think that you've imagined both of these. Maybe something sort of like that could be said in an off-hand comment, but I don't think anyone would make such a direct link between liking stuff for the other gender, and knowing they're trans.

If you've watched someone grow up who has gender dysphoria, there will be all sorts of hints over the years. Nobody actually thinks what you said. 

Why do people so often feel the need to imagine situations related to trans people which they disagree with? I see it all the time. I think it's just people scrambling to excuse their anti-trans thoughts."
