I had something similar happen years ago.

I saw my brother leaving his bedroom during the night, only to find out later that day that he wasn't even home, since the day prior. 

And one time my brother told me off for sneaking around when I was sleeping in the opposite room for the past few hours.  

Since then I've not experienced anything like it...as far as I can tell. 

Keep your eyes open and let us all know if you have another creepy encounter!"
