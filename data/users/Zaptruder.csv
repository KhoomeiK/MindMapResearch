Have some characters usable in multi-roles while using 1-3-2 comp. Off tanks can be used in tank/damage. Symmetra/Torb usable in damage/support. Reaper into tank/damage. Moira and Baptiste into damage/support.

If the max cap for a role is filled, players queued into different roles are locked from taking those roles - just like they can't take a hero that's already been picked. If 3 DPS queue in, the guy that queues tank/dps must pick a tank.

Immediately once sufficiently heated, bend the gasket to increase the bend.

Let me say that if you can wear your glasses with a reasonable degree of comfort in your VR headset of choice - then there's not much reason to get these.

What most people don't mention... but they should... is that these things reduce your field of view. You see that outer black part? That slips over the lens holder on the HMD. You see that big thick border? That's the lens holder on the perscription. It's much bigger than the border on the HMD... and thus, will naturally cut out some of your FOV while using it.

With that said - that's my personal experience relative to my face shape. It's worth noting I can wear the Index with glasses at the closest eye relief without much discomfort. Other users that couldn't move the lenses closer while wearing glasses are able to do so with these - and so are able to recover or even improve their FOV with it.

I bought mine to alleviate some pressure on my temples as my glasses (I later fixed that by heat bending the facial interface) were near the edge of the maximum width that could fit in the HMD. They did do that, but they also added pressure to the ridge of my brow where my glasses weren't.

Additionally, they're a tight fit - so if you frequently allow other people to use the HMD, then it's quite bothersome taking them on and off.

Finally, and it's a temporary issue, but an issue nonetheless - you'll notice distortion due to the fact that they're another pair of lenses - similar to the distortion you get when you try on a new pair of glasses (with your perscription).

Unfortunately, for me, these were the worst purchase of last year - not really fixing the issue I bought them for and creating a couple new ones that no one else on Reddit talks about."

Of course, there becomes questions of how much the market can bear - raise it $1, and people are still going to retain employment. Raise it $10... and a bunch of businesses become non-viable for a while while the market readjusts its expectations (there'll be less demand at the new prices that these things have to be in order to pay for those living wages).

OTOH, there'll be a lot more money moving around in the economy as everyone's wages are lifted relatively, so it'll compensate for some of the demand loss from price increases.

The only way to get anything resembling full range of motion on an ODT is to make it room sized. That type of unit isn't cheap - we're talking 6 figures (for the treadmill) and a custom room to accommodate it.

Even then, it has a variety of limitations, including no slope adjustment, the actual feeling of rollers under your feet, limited crouching/bending/etc motion.

With smaller ODTs, they straight up restrict your range of motion, and they still don't feel like walking/running. Your feet are very sensitive to how things feel - and walking on a rolling platform will feel like that... and sliding on a dish is going to feel like that too. Moreover, you'll be strapped in for liability and accident prevention reasons, so it'll feel like you're strapped in too. Which will also cause balance and weight shifting issues because we use our torso motion to position us around easily - much less so when strapped in.

The main benefit of ODTs over other solutions is very simply - increased hip swing. Is that benefit significant enough to compensate for all the cons?

The human body and mind exists on the same plane of reality as everything else in this reality. We have an incredible depth of knowledge showing how the material matter of the brain affects the inner workings of the mind.

We do not understand all of it of course, but no solid evidence whatsoever of extenral non-physical mechanisms affecting the mind.

It is reasonable for us to conclude at this point in time that we will continue better understanding the mind and its inner workings by figuiring it out on the basis of the material physical universe in which it exists, rather than hoping for some exclusive new mechanism of interaction that pertains only to the mind/brain.

The main difference between now and then will be the comfort, resolution, and that you can still see your immediate surroundings via passthrough/AR - and in essence will play a lot more like a desktop game on an arbitrarily sized screen."

""Hey, things look bad sure, but actually, if you look at this specific set of numbers, they're actually quite good!""

This article (opinion piece) is the sort of shit that gets waved around to justify status quo - As in, ""Look, stop complaining, things are *actually good*.""

It's like saying that China has helped bring the greatest number of people out of poverty in the last 50 years, so they must be a force for good.

Well, it is true, but it also ignores that China is an oppressive and totalitarian regime, that is increasingly improving their tech and economic manipulation, looking to trample over the democratic (and even egalitarian) values that much of the world has taken for granted for much of the 20th century. They're also responsible for the greatest increases in green house gas production... but it's also true they have the most significant investment into renewables.

The reality is generally more complex... and despite the positives listed in the article, our reality is facing several existential crisis`, and the tools we have to address them... seem to be falling out of our grasp as we speak!"

Of course - and the context is modified by ones initial perception, which is beyond the control of the person (in many respects anyway).

Point is, this article is drawing the boundary of the word creepy to encompass 'unattractive', although the initial spirit of the word was used as a signifier for 'behaviour that makes others uncomfortable'.

If we want it to be the latter only, then we need to modify and compensate for internal biases. Otherwise we should be honest with ourselves and recognize that it's simply a catchall term, that isn't entirely reflective of behaviour.

Going back to our attractive back rubber - how long does this person know you for before it stops being considered creepy? A few minutes? A couple meetings? What about Mr Unattractive? Does that change the ratio? It'll most certainly change the context of the initial meeting and further interactions."

Of course there are harder boundaries that will get Mr Good Looking labelled a creep - but it'd be closer to the line of harassment, like groping a stranger, while that line for Mr Not So Good Looking might be drawn at attempting to strike up a conversation.

I mean... just visualize a scenario where you're approached by a random stranger that 1. you find attractive, 2. you find unattractive - and then simulate what you might find to be acceptable to you as far as social interactions go.

Maybe the best of both worlds approach is to have a camera that zooms in and out based on the context of the scene - fight = zoom camera between player and monsters in fight. Platforming = zoom camera further out to allow for more sightline and movement.

The positive consequence of that approach is that you can have platforming sections that are more intricate without feeling disorientating (because you can't see the big picture).

I think an easy way to prototype the validity of this approach is to allow zoom on mouse wheel/right thumb stick."

That's the most bullshit line in the history of capitalism.

Capitalism works best (most reliably and robustly) when costs are accurately. Unaccounted costs are still paid for by someone somewhere. These are called externalities.

Accounting for those costs are simply the job of regulation.

Therefore, capitalism needs regulation to operate at peak efficiency.

Modern day capitalism has been offsetting costs to the future for decades... and of course, we're now paying for many of those externalities through degradation of working conditions, of earning power, of political power, of our environment and our future potentials."
