Or the little dinosaur in the Chrome Browser, at which point I have no clue if I’m saved or dead, that little bugger looks hungry."

Your game partners only understand the rules about as well as you.

Your pet still has “accidents” in the house.

Sometimes the food is burnt.

Actually, basically life! Those perfect imperfections that make us appreciate what we have. In heaven we’d expect too much and probably be disappointed when something goes wrong unless we’re just appreciative in general."

todayilearned,fed4ib6,t3_eojjrb,1578998439.0,"Unintended consequences during space travel! Imagine not knowing this beforehand being a set of planned intergenerational colonists on a 100 year mission to somewhere else, and this starts to become a problem.

Then think about problems we _don’t_ know of yet! Going to have to allow for a lot of redundancy and seemingly purposeless stuff."

AskReddit,fcjzfsp,t3_ehkobj,1577711611.0,"Specifically for the guy whose responsibility is to maintain the pavement and asphalt, I think he’d react like the cabbage guy. And we’d feel similarly toward him."
todayilearned,fc87jyr,t1_fc8656v,1577528636.0,"The US counts babies that “display” a sign of life as a live birth. Many other countries do not count a baby as a live birth if it is below a certain weight. Thus the US has a disproportionate number of premature births counted in its infant mortality, compared to other countries. Premature births have a drastically higher mortality rate. This spikes the infant mortality statistic, so comparisons across countries without adjusting is disingenuous.

As you said, you just made a stab in the dark —just thought you’d find it interesting."

You have guarded my Funk. And now, all of your descendants will bear this reverent title. From now till ever, you will be known as Funkegard!”

But in seriousness, Funke means “smith” and garde means guard / could mean “defense.” So perhaps an armor smith? I like guarding the funk better, and you should know better, coming from 1138."

So, really, this is a question between being a millionaire or a millionaire turtle. May matter to some folks weighing this question!"
todayilearned,fc7956y,t1_fc7102b,1577500820.0,"Yes, with the risk of contention. I think wine is like a driver’s license test. If it passes a certain bar, there is little correlation beyond the threshold of expertise.

A bad wine is a bad wine. A good wine is a good wine. Are there differences? Yes! But the difference to an extent that you can charge £150,000 per bottle? That’s not taste. That’s historical context or hubris!
