dogs,fekdzdu,t3_epmn2p,1579198057.0,">We think it might be linked to the fact the dog originally lived over in Cyprus and there’s a lot of stray cats there that the dog would often be encouraged to chase but other than that we have no idea why.

OK, but dogs have some amount of prey drive. And this dog wasn't raised from puppyhood with cats. 

Is your dog trying to bite them at the neck or grab the body to shake a cat? 

Also, starting now, you really should separate them. Put your cat stuff somewhere safe and make safe paths for your cats. Use gates for this dog. Don't allow him to rehearse this behavior like he has been. If you need to keep his leash on to help redirect him, then do it, but you should be training him to focus on you and ignore the cats. If you've started this training, is he able to break his own stare or look away or turn his head when you call his name? 

If your dog has high prey drive for cats, no there is not a (humane) way of training it away. My dog doesn't behave on walks that way with squirrels anymore, but that doesn't mean his instinct is gone. It isn't. In the yard it shows."

dogs,feippye,t3_epd212,1579144145.0,">How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
Important.


I place retired racers and can tell you that any adoption group will have a no-offleash-in-unfenced-areas clause in the adoption contract; this is just standard for Greyhound groups. You also mentioned recall. Know that prey drive may not work in your favor, and it only takes that one time and your sighthound is out of earshot, wouldn't listen anyway, and is focused only on running that thing down.

>(we don't have cats, however our families do and we'd like to take our dog to their house)
  

Applicants who have cats at home get priority. You may have to wait a while, and with the current shortages and irregularity of available dogs, it may add to wait time. Waitlists are long, and some groups have more difficulty in getting hauls for a number of reasons.
