The descriptions are just grim too though."

behindthebastards,femi1hs,t1_fem0617,1579256627.0,I was pleasently surprised with Jojo Rabbit and the way that it showed how Nazi propaganda was so tightly knit into everything they did. It was really well done.
AskReddit,fej72o7,t1_fei7ec5,1579159611.0,"Ah. Thanks for the background. I knew who he was as my boyfriend is into Lovecraft and I have read a couple of the short stories. But I hadn't realised that he had become a mascot for nerds.
