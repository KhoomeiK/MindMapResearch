toronto,fel3cnz,t1_fekk0yj,1579213172.0,Part of the problem is that the people being put out of a job in this sector are not the same people that can be hired to fix/maintain the machines. If you look at a stereotypical blue collar factory worker - maybe has his high school diploma. Does the same mindless job of fixing piece A to piece B on the line every day. That is nowhere near the same as machine operator. He will have to go to a warehouse. But wait. Those jobs are being automated too...

Is there a specific reason you are worried about the background check? 

Laying it out honestly is the best policy at this point. As an intern and just starting  out, a ""good"" manager will want you to do what is best for your career. Also, it is soon enough that they can find a new intern. 

BUT, this is assuming there is nothing questionable in your background. If there is something weird there, that you are concerned about, like a criminal charge or something, it would be best to drop out of the running in Company B and get a second year in at Company A."
