And for a while he knew he would be a pro. He even had to turn down a FC contract because of a badly timed car crash.


And then he played against the Waugh brothers. Who were pretty normal guys off the field, but as soon as they crossed over the boundary you could tell they would literally get themselves killed if it meant they could save a single run.
