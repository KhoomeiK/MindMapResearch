illnessfakersgonewild,ffvhi3a,t1_ffvfsym,1580264233.0,"I was in 7th grade or so when it came out and there was *always* one person who thought they were suddenly a witch after watching that movie and playing with a Ouija board once. You could chalk it up to normal middle and high schools wanting attention for sure. Kids have always done cringey shit, just today’s flavor of cringe is different."
Hair,ffvcznf,t3_ev6315,1580261214.0,"I go through cycles of growing it out really long then chopping it right to a shoulder length bob. I always regret it at first, but I have to remind myself I wasn’t doing any super exciting fancy hairstyles when I had long hair anyhow. I was putting it back in a bun or a pony 95% of the time and my feeling bad because I can’t do all sorts of braids is stupid, because I wasn’t bothering when I did have the hair! 

Shorter hair, even just around collarbones almost always looks better on people than the weight of really long hair, unless someone is an expert stylist or has someone around who regularly does their hair. A good chop always makes hair look fuller and healthier too!"
illnessfakersgonewild,ffsr722,t1_ffsokct,1580189577.0,"Omg we had the trenchcoat mafia too of course! My friend’s neighbor’s older sister once convinced some us she was going to be in Sassy but I feel like that was middle school. 

I am having such nostalgia for stuff now. When malls were still a decent option to go to, or when we went to the video store more nights than not during the week. Having to watch movies in theaters multiple times just to see important scenes again because there was no way around it until it was for sale otherwise. Shows like Daria or original first few seasons of Real World (Seattle omg with the slap) on MTV, or Pop-Up Video on VH1. Recording mix tapes of songs off the radio so well that you have perfect timing for pause and record buttons. So many things that were satisfying in very different ways."
illnessfakersgonewild,ffsnlm9,t1_ffsmjsb,1580186360.0,What about when The Craft came out and suddenly there was a witch at every sleepover? Or the girl with the always elusive and mysterious boyfriend who goes to another school?
