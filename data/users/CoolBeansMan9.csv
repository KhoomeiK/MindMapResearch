Daniel and Henrik Sedin are now retired, but will surely be inducted in the Hockey Hall of Fame one day, together. They are identical Swedish twins and played on the same line (for the most part) their entire 17 season career)

Fun facts: 

* Daniel and Henrik were drafted 2nd (Daniel) and 3rd (Henrik) by the Vancouver Canucks in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft. They were a ""package deal."" Canucks General Manager Brian Burke had to work multiple trades to get 2 picks together high enough to draft the twins (Today he jokes about how he still screwed that up, because he drafted Daniel before Henrik, and Henrik is the better one. You'll see why that is funny.) 

* Hockey can be a rough game. It's not uncommon for a player to miss time throughout their careers due to injury. The Sedins played from 2000-2018. Their career games played are Daniel (1,306) and Henrik (1,330). 

* Daniel was the ""goal scorer"" and had 393 goals, Henrik had 240 

* Henrik was the ""playmaker"" and had 830 assists, Daniel had 648 

* Overall points, Daniel had 1,041 and Henrik had 1,070 - pretty crazy

* Henrik won the Art Ross Trophy (most points in a season) in 2010 with 112 points. He would also win the Hart Trophy as the league's most valuable player. 

* Not to be outdone, Daniel won it the following season with 104 points. He would win the Ted Lindsay Award as the league's most valuable player, as voted by the players.  

* Daniel played 102 playoff games (71 points) and Henrik played 105 playoff games (79 points). 

Their overall consistency, but even more crazy, their consistency to be top caliber NHL producing players *together* was remarkable. Their chemistry on ice, for such an extended period of time, may tops all time, if not second to Gretzky and Jari Kurri"
