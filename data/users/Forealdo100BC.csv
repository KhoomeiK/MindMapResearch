zen,fg0sbq7,t1_fg0rvoj,1580414051.0,"I will explore these topics and especially look for teachings where zazen is not included in the teaching, thank you for pointing me towards new information"
zen,fg0rmzs,t1_fg0qriy,1580413668.0,It would be disingenuous to suggest there have not been changes in doctrine and dogma over the passage of time. There are differences in practice between Zen schools.
zen,fg0pz4c,t1_fg0pqgj,1580412747.0,Are theirs the only lineages you consider authentic?
zen,fg0ovqh,t1_fg0n2pa,1580412141.0,I have not found your second sentence to contain much truth. Of course their are Zen sects that  emphasize or deemphasize the importance of zazen to Zen. Can you share some examples so that I can better understand where you are coming from?
gifs,fg0kosx,t1_fg0kg7f,1580409738.0,"I apologize, I do not follow where you are going. You may want to look into the radium issue, especially if you live around PA, WV and Ohio, they have higher concentrations of radium 226 in the rock formations."
leagueoflegends,fg0k9yj,t3_ew4p0t,1580409502.0,I have a hard time believing this game isnt a form of self punishment unless you are playing aram or a temp game mode.
depression,fg0k0fc,t3_ew68pa,1580409347.0,You made this post. You could reply if you wanted them in your life but it isnt worth it to you so they will give up and move on.
CryptoCurrency,fg0jcdy,t1_fg0j9ih,1580408964.0,Thanks cucumberass.
leagueoflegends,fg0izs3,t1_fg0gqbw,1580408765.0,Then why did you continue it and reply to him?
zen,fg0itnd,t1_fg0iqel,1580408667.0,"Nevermind, have a great day."
zen,fg0ibcw,t1_fg0i1nx,1580408377.0,"No I am asking why you diatribe started with the sentence, no one can help you. 10 min later you asked me how you can help others, it doesnt make any sense and I dont know why you think you should be involved."

zen,fg0gbhg,t1_fg0g3g3,1580407205.0,"You obviously care and seem worked up, it is ok. I subscribe becuse I enjoy some of the koan. And enjoy the non dogmatic discussion."
zen,fg0fsyc,t3_ew8u22,1580406899.0,"This subreddit is, from my limited observation, not a place to discuss zazen or other steps in the path to understanding. It is a place to exchange riddles that help solidify the ego. If you want to discuss something other than koan this is probably not the place you are looking for. I do like what you wrote but I dont think the regular commenters would be interested. Some of your ideas may not have the correct lineage and Zen here is not a vehicle to understanding, here Zen is only a thing and manner in which to discuss Zen."
CryptoCurrency,fg0evla,t1_fg0enud,1580406340.0,Might doesnt make right and in fact it seems more likely the opposite is true. I suppose we see things differently and appreciate your comments. Have a great day.
CryptoCurrency,fg0du5q,t1_fg0d93c,1580405715.0,"It probably isnt the best we have or the best we can do, our prosperity can be linked to our neoimperialism and destruction of the environment more so than as some beacon of how just our society is. i like your optimism, it is inspiring even if I think it is an apologist attitude based on how much value you receive from our heirarchy of exploitation."
CryptoCurrency,fg0ck86,t1_fg08sk9,1580404941.0,I dont see how your last paragraph is a bad thing amongst a culture that is actively poisoning the planet and simultaneously trying to turn it into a parking lot.
Libertarian,fg0cbxn,t1_fg0caea,1580404804.0,If it makes you fell better it is ok with me. Have a great day.
Libertarian,fg0c7ri,t1_fg0c6k9,1580404734.0,I might fuck off now and later
Libertarian,fg0bwfg,t1_fg0bucq,1580404544.0,"Thank you, I dont think I would want you to like me or think that I was intelligent"
Libertarian,fg0bldu,t1_fg0bgqp,1580404362.0,"Way to keep your cool and be a positive light for libertarianism or the status quo, whichever side you are on. Thank you for being apologist for authority."
Libertarian,fg0bcza,t1_fg0b1pt,1580404223.0,"Perhaps but that doesnt seem like a very objective criticism. It is not as if your comment insinuated you thought the comment karma reqs are bad, in fact you said it should be easy for him to generate positive karma so as to not have this problem. Which brings me to my question why should he want to have popular opinions amongst a populace that allows for unending war and for profit prisons?"
MMA,fg0b091,t3_ew6wx9,1580404007.0,"I dont think you understand the media, their goal is not to be objective, it is to spit out hot takes and get clicks."
Libertarian,fg0atwu,t1_fg0ao5n,1580403898.0,It was in reference to your defending karma requirements on comment time delays.
Libertarian,fg0aazv,t1_fg089ja,1580403584.0,Why would you want to have popular opinions among a populace that allows unending war and for profit prisons?

geopolitics,fg05t4o,t1_fg05pw6,1580400854.0,You're a dumbass apologist who doesnt even understand political labels.
Vechain,fg054uv,t1_ffzth1j,1580400426.0,Honestly this is a dumbass hopium post that creates false hype and makes vechain and the community look bad.
geopolitics,fg04t4u,t1_fg04h6g,1580400220.0,They are just trying to emulate what we did with the slaves and native Americans.
politics,fg04krg,t1_fg039p3,1580400073.0,"I dig salon, this is one of my favorite parts of the civil war and what makes it one of the most American things ever, both sides were completely full of shit about their motivations, sure each side can point to bullshit such as radical republicans, if you think the civil war was justified, or the UCD if you are against the war. But it is mainly a pile of shit excuses. The south's only reason for suceeding was the expansion of slavery and keeping slavery as institution. The North's only reason, outside the few radical Republicans, was retaining the territory and tax base. It really is sad and further proof that we cannot accept our faults from the past and will likely never be the good guys because of it."

politics,ffzcjq1,t1_ffzcf0d,1580372265.0,We can discuss what I think shouldve happened or we can continue to discuss what did happen. I am not making excuses for anyone and I dont think the confederacy was in the right.
politics,ffzc36k,t1_ffzbxmf,1580371667.0,"It really is unfortunate he did not go down there and murder all the slave owners and dole out the land to the slaves, at least then we would have a reason to be proud of the usa."

depression,ffz8cl2,t1_ffz87z8,1580367152.0,I feel ya. Sometimes I think the earth and even the universe is one big organism and it is my job to endure the emotional pain that our species is causing because if I didnt do it nobody would and the organism wouldnt learn that things need to be better. Kinda silly but it is one way I cope with the destruction I see.
depression,ffz83vg,t1_ffz7zqx,1580366934.0,"Then neither do I and it is ok, we can comfort each other and pretend and sometimes it is better than hurting even if it isnt true."

depression,ffz7xp5,t1_ffz7tpu,1580366778.0,How can you know this? How is it possible for anyone to know this? Btw you are a reflection of me and we are having this conversation to ourselves.
depression,ffz7rkk,t1_ffz7pzb,1580366625.0,That is why you are special and that is why you matter.
depression,ffz7mv2,t1_ffz7il4,1580366509.0,There isnt anything to say. You are in a bad position. Life isnt easy. Be there for your friend do the best you can to get her help. You cannot fix her but you can give her support while she fixes herself.
depression,ffz7ff8,t1_ffz76gz,1580366324.0,That isnt healthy or ok and will likely lead to the scenario I mentioned.

depression,ffz6fwy,t1_ffz63jx,1580365462.0,The likely scenario is that you go rescue her she doesnt get better and you both kill yourselves. I do not blame you either way. I hurt for you very much I am not projecting my story onto you but I will say I tried what you are suggesting and she hasnt killed herself yet but the results hurt me very much and did not help her at all. Maybe you can get a job and help her get counseling.

You should comfort her and help her and if she can get a little better maybe she can join you one day. It is not possible for YOU to fix this but you can be there for her emotionally and help her fix it and be there for when she does.

Libertarian,ffz4s1g,t1_ffz4g7a,1580363959.0,Driving recklessly and being a reckless driver can mean different things in which case you are using the wrong one.
Libertarian,ffz4m1w,t1_ffz4g7a,1580363796.0,"I will summarize your argument, correct me if I am wrong. If it only effects me it is not reckless.

This is not what reckless means. It means taking chances that up your risk of injury and do not provide a discernable difference in output to justify the increase of risk. 

Who or what reckless effects has nothing to do with it. This is how definitions work. You are choosing to be reckless while driving. Wtf"
SBTcommunity,ffz43oj,t1_ffz3zti,1580363305.0,"I dont think he was shooting for julius ceasar status with that move. He is still likely more famous than he would've been, if that was even his point."

Just because you can choose to take unneccessary risks that only potentially damage yourself does not mean the choice isnt reckless, it may make it less selfish or not immoral. But by definition by increasing your risk factors your are increasing the amount of recklessness you are employing."

Libertarian,ffz3dkc,t1_ffz38i2,1580362623.0,Why would you want more people? Whether something only effects you is not how you come to a decision about what is or isnt reckless. Since it only effects you it is not immoral but it is still reckless.
politics,ffz33pt,t1_ffz2u8f,1580362378.0,Are you refuting my Lincoln paraphrase? If not you dont have much of a leg to stand on. This is pretty similar to the drivel we hear about Iraq or Vietnam.

Libertarian,ffz2e8m,t1_ffz25j6,1580361738.0,Perhaps you should learn what reckless means. I can get down with what you are saying but your argument doesnt have anything to do with whether the decision is or is not reckless. I am cool with people not wearing helmets and seat belts as long as they require them for minors in their car/ on the motorcycle and they dont expect an ambulance to be called or even cannot have an ambulance called in the case of a wreck.

But to kill so many people over territory/taxes and then just leave people down there under jim crow for another 100 years is morally bankrupt. I am not saying the civil war should not have happened I am just pointing out that it did happen for the wrong reasons and the outcome was piss poor at best. Until we start recognizing and accepting our faults there is no chance of us improving, see unending war and for profit prisons."
