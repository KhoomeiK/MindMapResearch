I remember watching how the Rooneys and  Colbert handled the new coach at first. And in the press, too. 

Kind of like how a HC and OC would handle the game plan for a young backup QB in the middle of a winning season. 

But not for long. It took Coach Tomlin little time to shed those reigns and show that he was more than capable."

food,feip9br,t3_epcddn,1579143833.0,"That soup looks very good!

I made chicken soup this past Sunday.  And I’ve had a healthy bowl of it each day since.  So good.

I used 2 large split breasts that I removed most of the breast meat from but left enough on for the soup. I then boiled the breast ribs/bones/meat for 30 minutes to create a stock base. I removed breasts, pulled the meat from the bones and added it back to the stock. 

I then added carrots, onion, celery, garlic powder,  little corse black pepper and some parsley. I also added some boxed  unsalted chicken broth to add some volume and let it all simmer for a bit.

I used Acini de Pepe pasta (those tiny pasta balls) because they really hold up well and are excellent in soup!

Homemade soup is so much healthier with the fresh ingredients and without all the ridiculous amount of sodium found in all of the canned soups."
