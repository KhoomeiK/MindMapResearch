depression,fdcl0vr,t1_fdci50r,1578277533.0,I just got off the phone with my one friend I could be completely honest with and she said she can't handle my calling anymore.
depression,fdcgp83,t1_fdcfbhu,1578274460.0,"I have a therapist appointment tomorrow. Unfortunately I've read lorazepam od won't do it, I was hoping it'd be enough for forever sleep. Im scared of everything, attempting it, continuing to suffer everyday, trying to find new meds, I dread falling asleep because the shear panic I feel every morning is unbearable. I don't know what to do anymore. Im close to 40 with nothing, just a burden on those around me with my constant...well me.. I've always thought suicide should be accepted. Why do we hold people in this misery when we put animals out of theirs?"
depression,fdcf7lc,t3_eihb2v,1578273419.0,"I feel this way often. I want to give up more than anything, i wish I were brave enough to end it. Im scared it won't work and will be much worse after a failed attempt."
NPD,edqzzde,t3_aenxwz,1547157553.0,"It took me 6 years to remove myself from the emotion and accept the truth I had seen all along. I am still in the home as this was merely a week ago. But since I decided I've had enough, I've been able to be an observer, not a victim. I wrote this to help me and hopefully help others too. :)"
