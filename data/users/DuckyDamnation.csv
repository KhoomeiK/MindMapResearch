People are racist, sexist, homophobic, and disrespectful on this site. If anything this site promotes you not to be yourself. People karma whore for fake internet points, stealing something from someone and don’t give credit. And when it isn’t memes on this site it becomes a problem. A real conversation is sparked and opinions come out, and people don’t listen, they just yell, and yell, spouting what they believe with the intent of being right, and not to persuade the other person. And all for ego, and points. This site sucks"
