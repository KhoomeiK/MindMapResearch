I know what ypu mean though bullying at an early age can traumatize people for life as that fear gets hard wired into the brain and its very difficult for your neurons to rewire and form new pathways that dosnt associate fight or flight with social situations.

Thats my take on it, Im a pacifist buttt there is times where you have to act in a way that your ready to charge someone of the side of a bridge so you both fall. In most cases those pieces of shit flee if youbplay the mental guy, ots aboutvout psycing the bully.

I guess as an example whats the % of none smoking adults in their 30s compared to teens who start a life long addiction ?

I guess thr best way is to make them want not to stat bad habbits. Ebergy drinks is the big one,I was never really into them when they cane out. But as a year old to me it was legal speed. There is definitely a euphoric buzz of them and they do cause addiction and stroke.
