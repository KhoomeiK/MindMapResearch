oddlysatisfying,ffgfqee,t3_etdjll,1579905216.0,I didn’t read the title and thought they were candy. And now I want orange candy...
BetterEveryLoop,ffgf5fd,t3_etfff1,1579904850.0,I just laughed so hard I woke my husband up.
offmychest,ffgcy63,t3_esvl1h,1579903470.0,It’s our policy. If it’s obvious in the beginning that they don’t meet a set in stone requirement I don’t read it as closely. But we do read and respond to every application.
oddlysatisfying,ffebje9,t3_et16pi,1579842198.0,I read the title and thought it meant like carpet laid in a house and looked with horror thinking “that pad under the carpet is going to be ruined” then I realized that these are what I call rugs and can be hung to dry lol.
offmychest,ffe9ql5,t1_ffd0j8x,1579840613.0,I commented but can’t find it now. My company doesn’t accept resumes because 90% of the time they don’t have the information required for me to determine if the candidate meets the minimum qualifications. For example when someone lists a job on a resume they typically list  the years worked and that’s it. If my MQ is 1 year experience it’s 1 year of full time experience. So I need to know how many hours were worked per week for the time you were there. I have people list jobs and have 5 years experience but they only worked 2 hours a week. But I also work in government so things are a bit different than private sector.
offmychest,ffe9ejm,t1_ffdffgl,1579840332.0,Haha love this!
offmychest,ffe98nw,t1_ffcjuvi,1579840197.0,I’m a recruiter. We have a third party software. Indeed pulls our jobs. But I literally read every application. Even the ones where I’m advertising for an attorney and the people applying have no college. We do have generic form letters that we send out for rejection notices. The reason for that is for “legal compliance” issues. And also I sometimes get 300 applications for one job and I literally do not have time to do custom rejection letters for that many people for one recruitment when I have 9 other recruitments going on each with 100+ applications. But people call me all the time asking for details as to why they were disqualified. I am more than happy to go through their application with them and tell them what I needed to see. Sometimes they are missing a requirement and sometimes they didn’t put the duties I was looking for in the job description and I am able to help them for future applications.
offmychest,ffe8klp,t3_esvl1h,1579839649.0,"Indeed pulls jobs from my site and links you to my page. I do not post on indeed. I work for government and we have the application because there is specific information we need about each job on our applications. We actually don’t accept resumes in lieu of applications because if my minimum qualification is one year experience I need the information to tell me month and year and hours worked per week to verify you have the 2080 hours we consider one year of full time experience. We also have supplemental questionnaires that have to be filled out as well. It has been my experience with other employers that indeed pulls their jobs as well. I would say it’s a safe bet that jobs on indeed that don’t let you apply through indeed aren’t posted on their by the employer, rather indeed haters the information and posts it."
BadMUAs,ffb9njs,t1_ff8uidf,1579756369.0,I was looking for an eyebrow comment. Like we need to discuss the eyebrows... although I don’t know what to say... I shall call them statement eyebrows.
AmItheAsshole,ffb7m6c,t3_esfxc0,1579754078.0,"Do people actually get paid minimum wage to watch kids? Average daycare here is 800 a month. So if you watch the kid 7:30-5:30 (so parents can get to and from work) you are watching the kid for 9 hours a day that’s 180 hours a month which would be 4.44 an hour. Granted most daycares have several kids but I don’t think I could afford to pay minimum wage for someone to watch my kid. Minimum wage for 45 hours a week would be 585 a week where I live. 

Anyway my brain went to math NTA for quitting because you don’t like your wage. But it wasn’t an issue until they won the lottery so that’s kinda not nice. Like... since you won the lottery I want some money too. Also I don’t know where you live but you might be expecting a bit much from child care pay for one child.

Edit: read the post again. Maybe this isn’t a full time situation? I think I’m tired from studying and confused myself."

SHRM,ff5ivc6,t1_ff4wj8m,1579594919.0,Thanks so much. I feel like I am getting worse as I study haha. I have a hard time with the “What would SHRM do” mindset at times. I work in government and it is very different. Although it has helped with some of the sections. The tip on the review/assess is helpful! My instructor told us to always go with the answer that has action in it. Sometimes there are two so the review/assess helps a lot. I’m going to retake the post assessment tomorrow. I’m not quite finished with the last book but I’m running out of time.

Do people not realize that just because it was easy for the person doesn’t mean they didn’t have training that they had to pay for and tools they have to buy? I saw someone on FB asking for a mechanic that would look at their car and tell them what was wrong with it and how to fix it and not charge them because they wanted to do it themselves.

NoStupidQuestions,fdg3d3p,t3_ekzqgc,1578378486.0,I’ve been told it travels to your brain and that’s where bad ideas come from.
AmItheAsshole,fdg10et,t1_fde71a7,1578376100.0,I always thought curly hair would be easier than my stick straight hair. Just throw mousse in and go. It was always my dream. I now have a friend with curly hair to her waist. I have watched her spend an hour on her hair and sometimes it’s amazing and sometimes it’s a tad frizzy. Granted I always feel her hair is drop dead gorgeous. But I’m like yeah if I’m in a hurry three minutes with a flat iron and I have great hair or 20 min with a curling iron and voila done. I feel straight hair is by far easier. Also if I’m on a budget I can get away with cheap products. Her hair gets too dry. So my exhausted rambling conclusion is I think natural curls are beautiful and should be appreciated for the time effort and money that goes into it.
AmItheAsshole,fdfycev,t1_fdfxuqd,1578373658.0,I went to Starbucks the other day and they handed me a drink. I didn’t look the right color and I looked at the tag and said oh this isn’t my drink. They apologized and handed me my drink and asked if I wanted it because they would just have to throw it away.
RBI,fdfuxoj,t1_fdf0uf5,1578370882.0,This. Sometimes Counties have a “suicide prevention task force” they can help find resources. My family cleaned up after my father and they still have “issues” I walked in the front door to start packing the house not knowing they were carrying out “stuff”. Definitely start a go fund me and share on here. If they had homeowners or renters insurance they should help.

AmItheAsshole,fczqbei,t3_ejdwnl,1578106743.0,"I don’t know if this is helpful at all but on the topic of division of bills, when my husband and I moved in together while we were dating I was concerned I wouldn’t be able to afford half of everything. He was established in his career and I was finishing school (I worked full time but it was a minimum wage job). I talked with him about it and mentioned I was thinking about getting a part time job in the evenings to help cover bills. We set down and went over things and did a 40-60 split because he made more than I did (his idea). 

We are now married and I make more than he does. We never put our bank accounts together because we spend money differently (we are on each other’s bank accounts for convenience). I’m not actually sure of the percentage split at this point but when we set up our budget it basically makes sure we have the same amount of “free and clear money”   We both work hard and neither of us feel like it is unfair.  If he wants to go out to dinner he pays. If I want to go out to dinner I pay. Or if it’s an anniversary we usually split it. 

It works for us. Not sure it would everyone but just a thought. Not sure how your BF would feel about an uneven split. 

Also. My husband will eat everything I cook so before we have dinner I pull out a small portion for lunch the next day and tell him this is my lunch for tomorrow. We eat and then he can decide if he wants seconds or lunch for tomorrow. He is in a labor intensive job as well and does tend to eat more than I do."

ChoosingBeggars,fc4l8br,t1_fc39c6m,1577419962.0,I had put a deposit down on a DJ for my wedding a year away. I knew it was non refundable. I called 6 months before the wedding to let the DJ know we were changing wedding plans and apologize for the inconvenience to have to cancel. I never would have even thought asked for the deposit back. I booked him for a day in prime wedding season and then canceled. I felt bad because he was only getting the deposit and not the whole amount. I’m sure he booked someone in my place but there was no guarantee that he would and then he would be out money. I do not understand people’s mindsets. This is their livelihood. You aren’t going to try and haggle on the price of gas. Why are you going to try and haggle on a service? How can people view others time and talent as something to haggle over? I just don’t get it.

AmItheAsshole,fdg10et,t1_fde71a7,1578376100.0,I always thought curly hair would be easier than my stick straight hair. Just throw mousse in and go. It was always my dream. I now have a friend with curly hair to her waist. I have watched her spend an hour on her hair and sometimes itâ€™s amazing and sometimes itâ€™s a tad frizzy. Granted I always feel her hair is drop dead gorgeous. But Iâ€™m like yeah if Iâ€™m in a hurry three minutes with a flat iron and I have great hair or 20 min with a curling iron and voila done. I feel straight hair is by far easier. Also if Iâ€™m on a budget I can get away with cheap products. Her hair gets too dry. So my exhausted rambling conclusion is I think natural curls are beautiful and should be appreciated for the time effort and money that goes into it.
AmItheAsshole,fdfycev,t1_fdfxuqd,1578373658.0,I went to Starbucks the other day and they handed me a drink. I didnâ€™t look the right color and I looked at the tag and said oh this isnâ€™t my drink. They apologized and handed me my drink and asked if I wanted it because they would just have to throw it away.
RBI,fdfuxoj,t1_fdf0uf5,1578370882.0,This. Sometimes Counties have a â€œsuicide prevention task forceâ€ they can help find resources. My family cleaned up after my father and they still have â€œissuesâ€ I walked in the front door to start packing the house not knowing they were carrying out â€œstuffâ€. Definitely start a go fund me and share on here. If they had homeowners or renters insurance they should help.
CasualConversation,fdftt31,t1_fdeluwn,1578370034.0,"When My father passed I took all of his T-shirtâ€™s. He always wore tshirts with funny sayings on them. I plan to make a quilt out of them. His death was tragic and completely unexpected so itâ€™s Still too raw for me at this point but I have them sealed up waiting for me.

Frugal,fdag2ia,t1_fd53z37,1578245625.0,I do this occasionally. I did find for my sensitive skin I have to limit but I absolutely love it.
Frugal,fdad8ko,t3_ekfjjl,1578244750.0,Wow thatâ€™s awesome! I need to start looking in bulk cooking! Where do you get your plastic containers? Also do you cook everything before you freeze it?
AmItheAsshole,fczqbei,t3_ejdwnl,1578106743.0,"I donâ€™t know if this is helpful at all but on the topic of division of bills, when my husband and I moved in together while we were dating I was concerned I wouldnâ€™t be able to afford half of everything. He was established in his career and I was finishing school (I worked full time but it was a minimum wage job). I talked with him about it and mentioned I was thinking about getting a part time job in the evenings to help cover bills. We set down and went over things and did a 40-60 split because he made more than I did (his idea). 

We are now married and I make more than he does. We never put our bank accounts together because we spend money differently (we are on each otherâ€™s bank accounts for convenience). Iâ€™m not actually sure of the percentage split at this point but when we set up our budget it basically makes sure we have the same amount of â€œfree and clear moneyâ€   We both work hard and neither of us feel like it is unfair.  If he wants to go out to dinner he pays. If I want to go out to dinner I pay. Or if itâ€™s an anniversary we usually split it. 

It works for us. Not sure it would everyone but just a thought. Not sure how your BF would feel about an uneven split. 

Also. My husband will eat everything I cook so before we have dinner I pull out a small portion for lunch the next day and tell him this is my lunch for tomorrow. We eat and then he can decide if he wants seconds or lunch for tomorrow. He is in a labor intensive job as well and does tend to eat more than I do."

ChoosingBeggars,fcj4p6c,t1_fc7fhwo,1577677213.0,My dad always wanted to open a store in a small community and put up a sign â€œgone fishingâ€ and have people leave the money for the things they bought while he was out. I thought it was cute. He knew it would never work because a lot of people would just take things but it gave me a vision of a different life and different era.
ChoosingBeggars,fcj48ud,t3_eghuby,1577676884.0,Wow. They even offered to do an intro for free and the CB was an butt face. I swear!

ChoosingBeggars,fc4l8br,t1_fc39c6m,1577419962.0,I had put a deposit down on a DJ for my wedding a year away. I knew it was non refundable. I called 6 months before the wedding to let the DJ know we were changing wedding plans and apologize for the inconvenience to have to cancel. I never would have even thought asked for the deposit back. I booked him for a day in prime wedding season and then canceled. I felt bad because he was only getting the deposit and not the whole amount. Iâ€™m sure he booked someone in my place but there was no guarantee that he would and then he would be out money. I do not understand peopleâ€™s mindsets. This is their livelihood. You arenâ€™t going to try and haggle on the price of gas. Why are you going to try and haggle on a service? How can people view others time and talent as something to haggle over? I just donâ€™t get it.
