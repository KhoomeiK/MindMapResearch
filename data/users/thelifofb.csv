From a 3rd party perspective, it is easy to see what you, what we see.   
People never consider the perspective of the character at that moment.  


""urozumi Higurashi, the elderly user of the Mane Mane no Mi who has been helping Orochi during these years, used her skills to convince the other Wano Daimyos that Orochi should be the official Shogun of the country, and so it has been decided. Therefore Oden's request is futile."""

selfimprovement,fcboa84,t3_eguszh,1577589143.0,"Hi Malclark

That feeling is not a good one to have. Unfortunately, it is a concern that will always be around (unless you found another key to happiness or become rich).

It all depends on which perspective you want to choose. You can easily choose to live a way of life where  money is not an issue. For example,  if you put yourself in the right environment, commit your life/entity to a purpose may it be religious or helping others. Where yourself is put last/behind.

However, like many, money will always be something that is required, we need it to survive to achieve our dreams. To pay for a house, marriage and many other milestones in life. That is reality, we can only control our perspective per event, per day, per situation.

Sorry, my answer doesn't really help haha. My mind is volatile and is constantly shifting haha"
productivity,fcbmhqa,t3_egurms,1577588564.0,"The past few months have been the roughest month for me so far.   
I am re-reading a lot of self-help books that I have read a long time ago such as

\-The subtle art of not giving a f\*ck   
\-How to win friends and influence people  
\-Deep Work  
\-The obstacle is the way  


  
I also started an anonymous youtube channel and blog (till I feel confident to show my face),  where I can type out how/ what I feel, and so far it has been such a release both mentally and emotionally."

I would try this myself, to improve my ability to tell stories.
I am very anxious when it comes to telling stories, even tho I remember them, when I talk about I sound incoherent.

selfimprovement,fbz0ays,t3_ef5ckh,1577231276.0,"Hey man!

A 25 year old man here, and I still have those questions. The feeling of having wasted 10 or so years of my life.

It is a question that you will always be asking throughout your lifetime. It is normal, but the fact that you are aware of it is a good start. I was ignorant and oblivious for a long time until recently where reality dawned on me and that I have to face it.

No one can tell you how to change, what to do. It is a personal discovery. You do not have to force yourself to find a purpose, because that may lead you to the wrong path. Rather, what I would recommend is travel or work, meet new people. Experience anything as long as it is not bad for you (e.g. drugs), moderation is ok as long as you are aware I suppose. Discover things you hate, discover things you love, however, be careful as too much will confuse you (happened to me ) 

If you ask me what I would do if I were your age tho. I would study hard, if I don't like what I am studying I will do activities/ join different groups (while finishing my degree). I will meet up with older people who are much wiser and has more experience than me to see how are they doing/what brought them there.

Good luck"
