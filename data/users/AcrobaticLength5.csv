offmychest,fel3ax5,t3_epndfj,1579213141.0,"I read your post and it spoke to me. I feel that you put a lot of pressure on yourself as an individual. What you should come to realize is that you cannot do it all on your own. You should ask for help from people. Collaborate and try to seek out advice. No one person figures everything on their own. And yes, I see you are sad but there is one thing you must never forget. You are the one ultimately responsible for your life and what happens to it. No one said it was easy, but much of people situations are a reflection of their poor decisions when they are younger, I know I have many; we all do. The only thing you can do is continue to push against it, with the help of the people around you."

Instead of everyone remembering you for being a scholar and a winner, everyone will remember you as someone who dropped out. Before you know it, years will go by and you will have amounted to nothing and most people will have moved on and forgotten all about you. You’re not as special as you think you are, and that bottle will be the thing that drags you down.

Unfortunately, I was not with her when this happened so she obviously freaked the f out because she thought she had done something wrong and was going to be deported. Anyway, long story short, we didn’t get anything stolen; but she was very shaky for a while afterward. Idk how it works, but basically now any hacker can make it look like they are calling you from a legit number. As the poster said, no one important ever calls you; they will almost always send you a letter in the mail. Do not ever give up personal information about an account, especially a bank account."

Physics,fc4ta8n,t1_fc4sdkg,1577427581.0,"I agree with these statements. The only thing I would add for (3) is that a current is a charge that is moving. Since the divergence of the E field is equal to the charge density, then a current can literally be thought of as a time varying electric field which then induces a curling magnetic field. Looking at Maxwells Equations closely will give this behavior away, and will eventually lead to the production of electromagnetic waves (light) is the current is AC"

Stay long enough on here and you will see people celebrate a week, month, year, 5 years, etc. In fact, just the other day a gentleman posted on here claiming he has been 30 years sober. When I look at things like that I have two thoughts. First off, it is completely amazing to me, and somewhat inconceivable, that someone could actually go 30 years completely sober. The second thought is, what’s my excuse? Why is it that so many ordinary people can be so much mentally tougher than me, when I consider myself to be very mentally tough. Clearly I am not. Clearly I need to re-examine and reevaluate myself. Clearly I need to step my ass up, cause I know I can do better. The question is, will you?"
