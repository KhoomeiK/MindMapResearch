The family could not afford burial, so our owner built a memorial next to a pond on our 80 acre property. The employee was cremated and his remains rest under some beautiful stone work. It's beautifully landscaped and the pond is stocked with fish. His parents used to fish in the pond but they have not been to visit in awhile."

AskReddit,fda2mly,t1_fda03hm,1578240978.0,"Our anxiety and fear is lessened because she is home and out of a war zone. It's still there because we do worry about her PTSD. At first, she had trouble adjusting to civilian life and we worried whether she would be able to hold down a full time job. She was still very much in ""war mode"" when she came home. She choked my cousin in her sleep on night. They were sharing a hotel bed. You could not surprise her from behind, you would be punched. It was a reflex for her, not her fault. People would hear that rumor, then test it out. Some people are assholes. She had mood swings (though they are better now) that made it difficult to work with people for awhile.

She is much better but still has some progress to make. I think she does not seek treatment b/c she can't see it/stubbornness."
AskReddit,fd9tcu6,t3_eke62v,1578237792.0,"My sister fought 2 tours in Iraq. This 1st time she went was when the war had just begun and the news reported on how many soldiers were dying daily. There were long periods of time she couldn't talk, sometimes for months because of the missions she was on. It was terrifying for me and our family. I had to stop watching the news for the duration of her deployments, the anxiety and fear of hearing the soldiers death count daily was too much. So glad that season of our life is over. She is out, her position in the Army led to her career she has now but she now has PTSD that she won't seek treatment for."
