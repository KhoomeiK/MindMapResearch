Anyways the grenade launcher is the best weapon against him whe he's coming towards you ( not when he attacks, when he's walking ) the acid  rounds will stop him a bit, when he gets stoped run away to gain some distance and shoot his eyes, once his chest-eyes are exposed trow the strongest things you got, spark-shot, flame rounds, revolver with strong ammo.

Hope is what makes us keep pushing through even when everything is extremelly hard, you need to find hope, a reason to live, to go out.
Im not telling you to go out and smile like an idiot, people who tell you to smile are wrong, you should never do something if you don't want to or in this case if you don't feel like it, what you have to do is find a reason to smile.

You're telling me that you're not a good person but let me tell you, there's no ""good"" person,You can be a decent person,or a bad person.
You are not a bad person, a bad person wouldn't care if their suicide would hurt people around them."

Posting this is mostly a cry for help, something that most people going through depression do to see if people care about them and if they will notice their suffering.

Don't kill yourself, it's not worth it."

We were two guys and at first we were just friends  but then when I told him I was gay, there was just like a burning flame between us . . . The way we talked, the way we flirted and the fact that people always thaught we were together.

He was a cheater. He was with a girl and I was his "" secret lover "" he wasn't in love with her, he was just with her for the sake of having a girlfriend but in reality the thing he really wanted was me.
In the end we ended it multiple reasons and even though we're trough . . . Everyday when see something that reminds me of him, his in my mind."

Well because as he chases you around the station you can hear his footsteps and it can get very stressful and even more when you're in tight corridors and there's no way of escaping his big meaty fists of fury, he also is a big obstacle when you're trying to figure out puzzles. He also is extremely badass, like he's not even being serious as he's in the station chasing you around, he's just walking, we only see him being serious in the final battle against him and if it wasn't for Ada: Leon would've died."
