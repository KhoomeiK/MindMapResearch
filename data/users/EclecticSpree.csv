Unlike living with roommates, you don’t have to buy all your own groceries, just pay for a share, because you’re likely going to share meals and staples with your family in a way you don’t with roommates. You don’t pay per load for laundry, you might be able to carpool for your commute, car insurance is lower at a house in a residential neighborhood than at an apartment building/complex and the longer you’ve maintained the same address. There are dozens of little ways it’s going to be cheaper even if you’re paying a third (or whatever appropriate portion) of all the bills."

Being mired into it, they’re incapable of seeing the reality as horrifying as the rest of us, or to feel the shock, disgust and distress as one side of our political spectrum has fallen deeper and deeper down a well of authoritarianism masked by “playing” the system, even as those plays become more and more unprecedented, like making up a nonexistent rule to “justify” refusing to seat a Supreme Court Justice in an election year."

TooAfraidToAsk,fgl78kx,t3_ez5362,1580884434.0,"First, we need to separate dependence from addiction. Many people are physically dependent on painkillers in order to have any meaningful quality of life. That doesn’t make them addicted or make their usage a problem. 

When it comes to addiction, for people who take prescription painkillers for a medium term after an injury or surgery, the rate of addiction is about 2-3%. For people who take them long term due to chronic illness or pain condition, the rate is below 2%. So the overwhelming majority of people do manage their intake and use these medications successfully as intended. 

While the majority of people with an opioid addiction began with or limited their usage to prescription meds, what’s important to understand is that something like 85% of those people didn’t start out taking *their own* prescription meds, but pills they bought, stole or were given. The majority were also already users of other drugs."
