lego,ffas8gj,t3_ervuh1,1579743282.0,"I took a good look at the pictures and counted 56 studs for the entire length of the main truss. According to NASA the real truss is 109m long. 56 studs is 56 x 8 - 0.2 = 447.8mm long, so this works out to a scale of about 1:243.

Radar was no big secret at the beginning of WW2 and the Germans knew about British ground based radar (they had their own too), and the radar stations that lined the southern coast of England were prime targets for the Luftwaffe during the early phase of the Battle of Britain."
aviation,feuceq8,t1_fetccik,1579385259.0,"If I'm not mistaken the tension of the arrestor cables is also adjusted for each aircraft according to their current weight.
