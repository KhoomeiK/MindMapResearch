starbound,ffck3jp,t1_ffbpohv,1579801148.0,"No, I don't. In what way do railguns have ""slow"" knockback? The recoil takes place over precisely the same impulse as the impulse applied to the projectile. For any given length of rail, assuming a vaguely constant or even consistent acceleration, a longer impulse means a slower projectile; the point of a railgun is to fire projectiles at an extremely high velocity, so the acceleration must be high and the impulse therefore over a shorter time. If a railgun is not capable of firing at a higher muzzle velocity than projectiles (which do not have instantaneous recoil, for what it's worth), and thus a closer-to-instantaneous recoil, then there is no benefit to using them instead of classical chemical-energy projectile weapons. For what it's worth, even if dampers are used to ""slow"" the impulse transfer from recoil to the ship, which is no more feasible for railguns than with chemical projectile weapons (indeed, less so, since it's possible to construct essentially recoilless chemical-projectile weapons, in which the chemical energy is allowed to exit the back of the muzzle, although this effectively limits the efficiency of the charge's muzzle velocity), conservation of energy says you get the same result at the end of the process; it simply lowers acceleration and thus mechanical stresses, but in space with the absence of air resistance, would come out to the same changes to the ship's end vector.

I'm concerned that you don't seem to be understanding some of the core concepts here. In particular, you seem to be trying to force an arbitrary distinction between ""railguns"" and ""kinetics."" Railguns are a kinetic weapon; the point of the weapon is to accelerate a mass to extreme speeds to give it kinetic energy to kill a target. Railguns are simply different from classic guns in that they use electromagnetism instead of chemical energy (e.g. an exploding gunpowder charge) to accelerate the projectile. They are not like lasers, which rely instead on concentrated radiated energy to kill a target. I pointed this out above and you continued to attempt to enforce a false dichotomy. Can you explain what you see as the difference between the mechanism of a ""railgun"" and a ""kinetic"" weapon so that we can understand what's going on in your argument?"

starbound,ffbgz4u,t1_ffageo1,1579764854.0,"No. Newton's third law is the same for railguns as it is for ""regular"" knockback, whatever you mean by that. Since railguns are a kinetic weapon, they rely entirely on kinetic energy. The ratio of masses means that the ship will not go rocketing off like the slug, but that's true of traditional projectile weapons as well.

As other folks are pointing out, weapons like lasers which don't rely on the kinetic energy of the projectile have practically (though not entirely -- photons do possess momentum) zero recoil."

I suspect this is a misunderstanding of cats not responding to punishment *after* doing something bad, since they don't appear to make any connection between, say, having peed somewhere they shouldn't an hour ago and getting yelled at now. Using noisemakers, sticky tape, a spray bottle, or other techniques to provide an immediate aversion response to an unsafe/undesirable behaviour is effective and a good idea if you don't want a hellbeast in your house. To be specific -- you cannot spray the cat with water because you see that they already did something and you want to punish them, in the way that you could punish a human and use language to explain that the punishment is connected to past behaviour. You must apply the aversion -- in this case a water spray -- while you see the cat performing or preparing to perform the unwanted behaviour (jumping on your food prep counter). Different cats have different personalities, and will respond differently: some will power through the bad behaviour out of spite and make it a battle of wills, some will stop altogether, others will simply learn to wait until you're not looking or don't have the bottle at hand (in which case another method is a good idea, like sticky tape to teach them that jumping in the restricted space is unpleasant)."

A standard U-235 fuel rod is pretty much safe to hold in your gloved hand -- fissionable doesn't mean short half life (which does mean more radiation given off per unit fuel), and the stable uranium isotopes that make up most of the fuel rod (235 and 238, but 235 is what fissions) have nice long half-lives (millions of years) and are alpha emittors, which means that the radiation isn't likely to penetrate skin, much less feet of water. After it's been in a reactor a while, though, a lot of the 235 has fissioned into radioactive products, and some of the 238 and other mess being made in there will have absorbed neutrons and now you have a mess of actinides, many of them with a half life on the order of dozens of years or less, which is a nasty combination of ""not going to decay soon enough to stop being a problem"" and ""decaying fast enough to give off lethal radiation doses.""

There's some discussion of mages pulling their power from the elements (and thus being far more capable of doing so when they enslave an elemental spirit) in the story about finding the genie; there are numerous references to the mage's vulnerability in the time it takes to cast a spell (so if you're standing next to one with a weapon you'll win) and to needing hands free (although Yen does the frogging with her foot, IIRC -- she just doesn't get it completely right). The witcher signs are mentioned as easier to cast but less powerful.

For what it's worth, Stegobor was hiding in his tower because Renfri is immune to/resistant to magic. I recall Geralt asking him why he doesn't use magic on her, and him giving this answer; later Geralt tries to use a Sign on her, but she says they don't work on her.

classics,fdgm3he,t1_fdemqid,1578401909.0,"> but imagine if students learning Spanish today learned Spanish grammar+translation and then jumped straight into Cervantes!

On the other hand, there is a point to learning Spanish other than reading Cervantes. There is no functional use in taking Latin as a foreign language other than to read literature. The vast majority of students take their two years of high school language requirements; if they haven't touched real literature, then what's the point?

Some courses like the Oxford and Cambridge series walk a middle ground -- trying to be a bit more cognizant of language acquisition techniques while trying to incorporate some degree of cultural familiarity. Wheelock aims to slap students across the face with primary literature so that even if they take the minimum possible (and they likely will bail on such a painful course unless they have a motivating teacher) they still have a decent familiarity with ancient authors.

If you can find students who will, for some unknown reason, commit to a decade of Latin study with the vast majority of the utility hanging out at the far end of that course of study, then sure, natural second language acquisition is far and away the best course.

AskHistorians,fd92ufc,t1_fd65lss,1578227606.0,"21 April had been celebrated traditionally as the day of the year on which Rome was founded, celebrated by the Palilia in honour of the god(dess) Pales, a patron of shepherds. There was disagreement about the year, but calculations were done by counting backwards from the present day through lists of magistrates to determine when the Republic had begun; there was general agreement at the time that this should be dated to 509 BC and the expulsion of the Tarquins to 510. Assumptions then needed to be made based on traditional stories (now mostly available to us in the *Ab Urbe Condita* of Titus Livius) of the chronology of the seven traditional kings of Rome. There were different ways of counting this, and a few different dates in the same neighbourhood were arrived at by different methods. The 753 date comes from Atticus's calculations, made popular by Varro.

Archaeology tells us that the site of Rome had been inhabited long before 753, although it's important to note that this would not likely have been seen as a great obstacle to the founding myth, which makes no particular claim that no one had ever lived there before; indeed, Vergil's Aeneid has Aeneas get help from a friendly Greek king whose people have settled on the site of what would, centuries later, become Rome."

it might not be hard for an external observer to notice that I was quoting Shakespeare based on the common use of similar quotes from the Bard.

There are certainly other authors or texts where we don't know for sure what we're looking at. We have, for example, a rather mean bit of satire written about the death of the Emperor Claudius that, among other things, attributes his last words as ""Alas! I think I have shat myself"" with the comment that it wouldn't be surprising as ""he certainly shat on everything"", and then continues to be meaner along the way as we see the emperor go to the underworld for further abuse. The part where this is possibly extraordinarily cruel to a man who was subject to unknown physical and possibly mental handicaps (itself to be weighed against the part where he certainly did his very best to be a relatively tyrannical, if effective, ruler) aside, the text is not signed, and is titled only with the generic ""a Play on the Death of the Divine Claudius.""

Now, Cassius Dio, a historian who wrote in Greek, happens to record that the famous Seneca (the Younger) wrote a satire on the death of Claudius, and gives it the title Apocolocyntosis, which is meant to be a humorous name taking off of the concept of Apotheosis, in which emperors became divine after their deaths, but here meaning ""the gourd-becoming,"" or my personal favourite not-perfect translation, ""the pumpkinification."" Eventually scholars put two and two together and decided that the two texts must be one and the same, and so most editions now refer to the text as the Apocolocyntosis by Seneca. This is just conjecture from centuries after the fact, though, and there are a few problems -- there are no pumpkini-anythings in the text, it doesn't necessarily always read like Seneca (although that's a vague enough line of reasoning that it's mostly a good way to start a fight between classicists), and it does bear similarities to the style of the also-contemporary satirist Petronius.

If you've ever worked with real parchment, whether new or old, it's a different animal (pun intended) from paper. New parchment (which is stretched leather, rather than plant material like modern papers) cost a great deal, so rubbing used sheets with a wash removed the ink, letting you reuse. Much like using a cheap eraser, it wasn't perfect, and over time the text would return to bare visibility, letting us know that there was something there ""under"" the main text.

Incidentally, later in the middle ages, to prevent the text from returning, it became popular to properly polish off the text before reusing, so palimpsests from later on are less useful to us since the text is usually more thoroughly destroyed.

I intended ""surplus"" here in the sense that, for any number of reasons (you know someone else has a copy, or you don't use it much, or no one reads Syriac in your library any more, or your librarian decided it was Satanic), the decision was made to no longer curate the text. Old books were (and are) expensive to maintain, so if you don't need that text in your library, you're unlikely to pay for upkeep on a now-surplused item.

AskHistorians,fcxfzn8,t1_fcxcnpy,1578061946.0,"We do have, as you noted, a lot of cross-references within the surviving literature that indicate that most of the authors we have were highly (never universally -- Cicero was not fond of Catullus and his fellow authors, to give an example) regarded in their own time. Authors like historians and biographers in particular were most likely to survive when they were often cited, so where there is some ability to assign a quantitative value to this sort of literature, the ones we have access to were usually at least relatively good sources for their time period. Some stretches of time have far fewer sources available and we have to go with what we have access to at all, rather than what's particularly good. For more subjective genres, like poetry, we often have other texts that mention these authors and establish their popularity from another angle. I'm certain that there are various examples of more accidental survivals that you could find out about from our other specialists if you opened a new question. I will offer the first that comes to mind: one of the eras of Latin literature that tends to be rather more sparse is from the late Antique period, during the transition from a Europe dominated by the (Western) Roman Empire to the early Medieval Germanic kingdoms. There exists a document detailing the pilgrimage to the Holy Land of a nun (probably -- the text is largely lacking in any autobiographical cues), likely Egeria or Aetheria (only named as such by another author), from somewhere in western Europe. This is just a set of letters to her friends back home written by a pilgrim, so it is hardly something that would be considered a great work of literature in her own day. Of course, to the modern reader, it's quite a treasure precisely because it's not part of any golden canon -- the author is a woman who is well-enough-off to travel and write, but she is not terribly important, and her Latin is an incredible source for what the language of the lower classes (the ""Vulgar"" type of Latin -- not because it was obscene, but because the ""vulga"" is the crowd, or common people) was like as it exerted a strong influence on written Latin as well in the Late Antique and eventually began to morph into regional proto-Romance forms. So, useful to us now, but hardly one of the great works of literature back in her own day."
AskHistorians,fcxeksp,t1_fcxbowh,1578060864.0,"This could destroy the removed material, especially in the late Middle Ages, but is often actually an accidental boon to the textual historian. It is often possible to barely see the erased material on parchment (which is very sturdy and extremely expensive -- hence going through the tremendous effort of erasing it all instead of just grabbing a new sheet and starting fresh), especially with modern science, where some chemicals or wavelengths of light can make it easier to read the written-over text, called the *scriptio inferior*. Your reference to the de re publica is no doubt from the fact that Cardinal Angelo Mai, in the 19th century, was able to recover much of that text from a palimpsest (the term for a reused text, usually a parchment). Quite a few texts or portions of texts have been retained only as palimpsests. By definition the text being reused was considered surplus and would no longer be cared for (keeping books safe was an expense), so the alternative would likely have been simply to throw it out or let it decay; it thus seems to me unlikely that the chances for survival would have been high if those texts had not been selected for erasure and reuse.

These texts were almost certainly doomed to begin with; it is to the credit of monastic institutions, if we're to consider them as some sort of monolithic entity, that so many survived.

AskHistorians,fcx73m9,t3_ejagtq,1578053920.0,"It's important to bear in mind that the expected situation for a nearly 3,000 year old text is ""lost."" Almost all of the actual physical remains from so long ago will not have survived -- papyrus might rot, clay tablets crumble, libraries destroyed in fires, including an enticing trove of charred scrolls recovered from the ruins left by the eruption of Vesuvius... even if desert conditions might preserve things, they then have to be found again in a good enough condition that fragments can be reconstructed -- so we rely very much on most texts having survived through medieval copies; even here, we deal often with copies of copies, each of which was a significant investment in (handwritten) time and (pre-industrial paper) material, so there are many chances for a break to occur in the chain. If no one bothered making new copies of the text and keeping track of them, it almost certainly didn't survive. Thus, it needs to surprise us that certain things did survive, rather than all the things that did not.

Being particularly well-known or fundamental didn't guarantee survival: the epic poet Ennius more or less founded the Latin literary tradition, and was extremely well-known through the Latin Golden Age (he was quoted extensively by authors like Cicero, who expected his audience to be entirely familiar with the context, in much the same way that someone might nowadays toss out a bit of Shakespeare and know that an educated audience gets what you're saying), so his works certainly survived until then, but they are now essentially gone, except for the quotes used so often by surviving authors. Catullus is another tremendously influential author who was known in the Middle Ages to have existed and been important (a poem by another author survives calling him more important to the great city of Verona than the extraordinarily famous Vergil was to little Mantua) but practically none of his writing was extant until an old manuscript containing many of his poems was discovered around 1300 (bear in mind that this brings us up to the time of Dante Alighieri) which was itself then lost (copies of copies, again, are our provenance), and it is certain that he had written more which, so far as we know, are lost forever. In another example, there are few more famous ancient authors than the Greek poetess Sappho, the ""Tenth Muse,' who likely wrote centuries after Homer, and who was essentially universally known through classical Greece and Rome, as we can again see through quotations of her work or references to it, including one poem by the aforementioned Catullus that was very intentionally modeled on one of hers. The corpus of her works is practically gone -- a bare few complete or mostly complete poems remain, mostly from desert papyrus finds, and one inscribed on a fragment of pottery, but mostly we now have tiny bits and pieces. Even when we have complete works, they are often just a small fraction of the author's production -- we have seven of Sophocles's plays, and the titles for more than 120. Did Aristotle write a second book of *Poetics*, like the plot of Eco's fantastic ""Name of the Rose"" would require (spoiler alert, I guess?)? We have no way to know -- Aristotle said he would write it, but that doesn't mean he ever did.

There's a claim by Pietro Bembo, writing all the way back in the 16th century, that about 1% of ancient literature survived to his day. Of course, it's impossible to know the exact figure, since a great many things will have been lost that we will never know were ever written to include in the count (ancient grocery shopping lists, although they might not count as literature -- but what about idle scribbles or poets who never got famous enough for their names to be recorded? lesser known works even by famous authors? did Cicero keep a stash of mythological fanfiction in a private journal that we'll never find out about?), and so my guess is that 1% is likely to be too high and the real figure fundamentally unknowable. Essentially, then, it's amazing that we still have what we do, and there are plenty of authors we miss just as much as the Trojan cycle that we don't."

Adoptions for these purposes were generally from other families of the same status, not adopting extra children from the lower classes, so every one of these adoptions solved not one, but two problems. It's also worth noting that precisely this situation is the backstory for a play by Terence, the Adelphoi, in which one brother who has two sons has allowed his childless brother to adopt one of his sons so that each has one heir (and as it's a comedy, various hijinks ensue) -- and Terence himself, centuries before Hadrian and the emperors, was adapting from even earlier sources.

The recoil takes place over precisely the same impulse as the impulse applied to the projectile. For any given length of rail, assuming a vaguely constant or even consistent acceleration, a longer impulse means a slower projectile; the point of a railgun is to fire projectiles at an extremely high velocity, so the acceleration must be high and the impulse therefore over a shorter time. If a railgun is not capable of firing at a higher muzzle velocity than projectiles (which do not have instantaneous recoil, for what it's worth), and thus a closer-to-instantaneous recoil, then there is no benefit to using them instead of classical chemical-energy projectile weapons. For what it's worth, even if dampers are used to ""slow"" the impulse transfer from recoil to the ship, which is no more feasible for railguns than with chemical projectile weapons (indeed, less so, since it's possible to construct essentially recoilless chemical-projectile weapons, in which the chemical energy is allowed to exit the back of the muzzle, although this effectively limits the efficiency of the charge's muzzle velocity), conservation of energy says you get the same result at the end of the process; it simply lowers acceleration and thus mechanical stresses, but in space with the absence of air resistance, would come out to the same changes to the ship's end vector.

I'm concerned that you don't seem to be understanding some of the core concepts here. In particular, you seem to be trying to force an arbitrary distinction between ""railguns"" and ""kinetics."" Railguns are a kinetic weapon; the point of the weapon is to accelerate a mass to extreme speeds to give it kinetic energy to kill a target. Railguns are simply different from classic guns in that they use electromagnetism instead of chemical energy (e.g. an exploding gunpowder charge) to accelerate the projectile. They are not like lasers, which rely instead on concentrated radiated energy to kill a target. I pointed this out above and you continued to attempt to enforce a false dichotomy. Can you explain what you see as the difference between the mechanism of a ""railgun"" and a ""kinetic"" weapon so that we can understand what's going on in your argument?"

The witcher signs are mentioned as easier to cast but less powerful.

On the other hand, there is a point to learning Spanish other than reading Cervantes. There is no functional use in taking Latin as a foreign language other than to read literature. The vast majority of students take their two years of high school language requirements; if they haven't touched real literature, then what's the point?

Some courses like the Oxford and Cambridge series walk a middle ground -- trying to be a bit more cognizant of language acquisition techniques while trying to incorporate some degree of cultural familiarity. Wheelock aims to slap students across the face with primary literature so that even if they take the minimum possible (and they likely will bail on such a painful course unless they have a motivating teacher) they still have a decent familiarity with ancient authors.

If you can find students who will, for some unknown reason, commit to a decade of Latin study with the vast majority of the utility hanging out at the far end of that course of study, then sure, natural second language acquisition is far and away the best course. If you asked me whether it was the best use of school resources to ask that of students in general education, then I as a Latin teacher would have to admit that I had no particular defense."

There was disagreement about the year, but calculations were done by counting backwards from the present day through lists of magistrates to determine when the Republic had begun; there was general agreement at the time that this should be dated to 509 BC and the expulsion of the Tarquins to 510. Assumptions then needed to be made based on traditional stories (now mostly available to us in the *Ab Urbe Condita* of Titus Livius) of the chronology of the seven traditional kings of Rome. There were different ways of counting this, and a few different dates in the same neighbourhood were arrived at by different methods. The 753 date comes from Atticus's calculations, made popular by Varro.

Archaeology tells us that the site of Rome had been inhabited long before 753, although it's important to note that this would not likely have been seen as a great obstacle to the founding myth, which makes no particular claim that no one had ever lived there before; indeed, Vergil's Aeneid has Aeneas get help from a friendly Greek king whose people have settled on the site of what would, centuries later, become Rome."

But if you time skip, you'll notice that when you get to the last hour the wheel slows down quite a bit (and interestingly this also leads to some complaints about how pointless it is to make it slow to skip time). That's to allow you to mark off exactly when you want out and you exit the time warp. Easy to aim for right at 9:00.

As for the tediousness of eating and sleeping -- if you've been leveling up at all, you get perks, and I noticed on my first playthrough that by midgame, my perks had made it so that there was practically no reason to eat or sleep anymore, which meant that at about the time that the shine of having to take care of those basics wore off, they weren't an issue anymore; I found the timing of that pretty spot on.

>Cry havoc! and let slip the dogs of war

it might not be hard for an external observer to notice that I was quoting Shakespeare based on the common use of similar quotes from the Bard.

There are certainly other authors or texts where we don't know for sure what we're looking at. We have, for example, a rather mean bit of satire written about the death of the Emperor Claudius that, among other things, attributes his last words as ""Alas! I think I have shat myself"" with the comment that it wouldn't be surprising as ""he certainly shat on everything"", and then continues to be meaner along the way as we see the emperor go to the underworld for further abuse. The part where this is possibly extraordinarily cruel to a man who was subject to unknown physical and possibly mental handicaps (itself to be weighed against the part where he certainly did his very best to be a relatively tyrannical, if effective, ruler) aside, the text is not signed, and is titled only with the generic ""a Play on the Death of the Divine Claudius.""

Now, Cassius Dio, a historian who wrote in Greek, happens to record that the famous Seneca (the Younger) wrote a satire on the death of Claudius, and gives it the title Apocolocyntosis, which is meant to be a humorous name taking off of the concept of Apotheosis, in which emperors became divine after their deaths, but here meaning ""the gourd-becoming,"" or my personal favourite not-perfect translation, ""the pumpkinification."" Eventually scholars put two and two together and decided that the two texts must be one and the same, and so most editions now refer to the text as the Apocolocyntosis by Seneca. This is just conjecture from centuries after the fact, though, and there are a few problems -- there are no pumpkini-anythings in the text, it doesn't necessarily always read like Seneca (although that's a vague enough line of reasoning that it's mostly a good way to start a fight between classicists), and it does bear similarities to the style of the also-contemporary satirist Petronius. Thus, there's not a clear take among scholars whether we've got a Seneca, a Petronius, or something else in the text."
AskHistorians,fcyjh8a,t1_fcxu3s0,1578081093.0,"Recycling is precisely what they were doing. If you've ever worked with real parchment, whether new or old, it's a different animal (pun intended) from paper. New parchment (which is stretched leather, rather than plant material like modern papers) cost a great deal, so rubbing used sheets with a wash removed the ink, letting you reuse. Much like using a cheap eraser, it wasn't perfect, and over time the text would return to bare visibility, letting us know that there was something there ""under"" the main text.

Incidentally, later in the middle ages, to prevent the text from returning, it became popular to properly polish off the text before reusing, so palimpsests from later on are less useful to us since the text is usually more thoroughly destroyed.

I intended ""surplus"" here in the sense that, for any number of reasons (you know someone else has a copy, or you don't use it much, or no one reads Syriac in your library any more, or your librarian decided it was Satanic), the decision was made to no longer curate the text. Old books were (and are) expensive to maintain, so if you don't need that text in your library, you're unlikely to pay for upkeep on a now-surplused item.

AskHistorians,fcxfzn8,t1_fcxcnpy,1578061946.0,"We do have, as you noted, a lot of cross-references within the surviving literature that indicate that most of the authors we have were highly (never universally -- Cicero was not fond of Catullus and his fellow authors, to give an example) regarded in their own time. Authors like historians and biographers in particular were most likely to survive when they were often cited, so where there is some ability to assign a quantitative value to this sort of literature, the ones we have access to were usually at least relatively good sources for their time period. Some stretches of time have far fewer sources available and we have to go with what we have access to at all, rather than what's particularly good. For more subjective genres, like poetry, we often have other texts that mention these authors and establish their popularity from another angle. I'm certain that there are various examples of more accidental survivals that you could find out about from our other specialists if you opened a new question. I will offer the first that comes to mind: one of the eras of Latin literature that tends to be rather more sparse is from the late Antique period, during the transition from a Europe dominated by the (Western) Roman Empire to the early Medieval Germanic kingdoms. There exists a document detailing the pilgrimage to the Holy Land of a nun (probably -- the text is largely lacking in any autobiographical cues), likely Egeria or Aetheria (only named as such by another author), from somewhere in western Europe. This is just a set of letters to her friends back home written by a pilgrim, so it is hardly something that would be considered a great work of literature in her own day. Of course, to the modern reader, it's quite a treasure precisely because it's not part of any golden canon -- the author is a woman who is well-enough-off to travel and write, but she is not terribly important, and her Latin is an incredible source for what the language of the lower classes (the ""Vulgar"" type of Latin -- not because it was obscene, but because the ""vulga"" is the crowd, or common people) was like as it exerted a strong influence on written Latin as well in the Late Antique and eventually began to morph into regional proto-Romance forms. So, useful to us now, but hardly one of the great works of literature back in her own day."
AskHistorians,fcxeksp,t1_fcxbowh,1578060864.0,"This could destroy the removed material, especially in the late Middle Ages, but is often actually an accidental boon to the textual historian.

Your reference to the de re publica is no doubt from the fact that Cardinal Angelo Mai, in the 19th century, was able to recover much of that text from a palimpsest (the term for a reused text, usually a parchment). Quite a few texts or portions of texts have been retained only as palimpsests. By definition the text being reused was considered surplus and would no longer be cared for (keeping books safe was an expense), so the alternative would likely have been simply to throw it out or let it decay; it thus seems to me unlikely that the chances for survival would have been high if those texts had not been selected for erasure and reuse.

These texts were almost certainly doomed to begin with; it is to the credit of monastic institutions, if we're to consider them as some sort of monolithic entity, that so many survived.

Almost all of the actual physical remains from so long ago will not have survived -- papyrus might rot, clay tablets crumble, libraries destroyed in fires, including an enticing trove of charred scrolls recovered from the ruins left by the eruption of Vesuvius... even if desert conditions might preserve things, they then have to be found again in a good enough condition that fragments can be reconstructed -- so we rely very much on most texts having survived through medieval copies; even here, we deal often with copies of copies, each of which was a significant investment in (handwritten) time and (pre-industrial paper) material, so there are many chances for a break to occur in the chain. If no one bothered making new copies of the text and keeping track of them, it almost certainly didn't survive. Thus, it needs to surprise us that certain things did survive, rather than all the things that did not.

Being particularly well-known or fundamental didn't guarantee survival: the epic poet Ennius more or less founded the Latin literary tradition, and was extremely well-known through the Latin Golden Age (he was quoted extensively by authors like Cicero, who expected his audience to be entirely familiar with the context, in much the same way that someone might nowadays toss out a bit of Shakespeare and know that an educated audience gets what you're saying), so his works certainly survived until then, but they are now essentially gone, except for the quotes used so often by surviving authors. Catullus is another tremendously influential author who was known in the Middle Ages to have existed and been important (a poem by another author survives calling him more important to the great city of Verona than the extraordinarily famous Vergil was to little Mantua) but practically none of his writing was extant until an old manuscript containing many of his poems was discovered around 1300 (bear in mind that this brings us up to the time of Dante Alighieri) which was itself then lost (copies of copies, again, are our provenance), and it is certain that he had written more which, so far as we know, are lost forever. In another example, there are few more famous ancient authors than the Greek poetess Sappho, the ""Tenth Muse,' who likely wrote centuries after Homer, and who was essentially universally known through classical Greece and Rome, as we can again see through quotations of her work or references to it, including one poem by the aforementioned Catullus that was very intentionally modeled on one of hers. The corpus of her works is practically gone -- a bare few complete or mostly complete poems remain, mostly from desert papyrus finds, and one inscribed on a fragment of pottery, but mostly we now have tiny bits and pieces. Even when we have complete works, they are often just a small fraction of the author's production -- we have seven of Sophocles's plays, and the titles for more than 120. Did Aristotle write a second book of *Poetics*, like the plot of Eco's fantastic ""Name of the Rose"" would require (spoiler alert, I guess?)? We have no way to know -- Aristotle said he would write it, but that doesn't mean he ever did.

There's a claim by Pietro Bembo, writing all the way back in the 16th century, that about 1% of ancient literature survived to his day. Of course, it's impossible to know the exact figure, since a great many things will have been lost that we will never know were ever written to include in the count (ancient grocery shopping lists, although they might not count as literature -- but what about idle scribbles or poets who never got famous enough for their names to be recorded? lesser known works even by famous authors? did Cicero keep a stash of mythological fanfiction in a private journal that we'll never find out about?), and so my guess is that 1% is likely to be too high and the real figure fundamentally unknowable. Essentially, then, it's amazing that we still have what we do, and there are plenty of authors we miss just as much as the Trojan cycle that we don't."

Thus, you are correct, the second could certainly be ""Quis est quae plorat?"" -- and while the first example really ought by parallel to be adjectival as well since it stands not on its own but with ""puer,"" as the above link shows, the substantive is often enough used as the adjectival that they will probably both fly.

Ugh, no. It did not at all. I found the (avoiding spoilers) lead in to the Duarte deal and cooperation with OPA baddies that we've seen in this season was horribly underdeveloped in the books -- not enough lead in to make things credible, and yet such a potentially interesting part of this version of humanity's future. A major failing in the books' plot arc. Pulling back on the focus of this season to include the solar system is a valid adaptation, and in my opinion (hardly the only valid one) an excellent choice."

> For, although no one can be just, but he to whom the merits of the Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ are communicated, yet is this done in the said justification of the impious, when by the merit of that same most holy Passion, the charity of God is poured forth, by the Holy Spirit, in the hearts of those that are justified, and is inherent therein: whence, man, through Jesus Christ, in whom he is ingrafted, receives, in the said justification, together with the remission of sins, all these (gifts) infused at once, faith, hope, and charity. *For faith, unless hope and charity be added thereto, neither unites man perfectly with Christ, nor makes him a living member of His body*. For which reason it is most truly said, *that Faith without works is dead and profitless*; and, In Christ Jesus neither circumcision, availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by charity. This faith, Catechumen's beg of the Church-agreeably to a tradition of the apostles-previously to the sacrament of Baptism; when they beg for the faith which bestows life everlasting, *which, without hope and charity, faith cannot bestow*: whence also do they immediately hear that word of Christ; If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. Wherefore, when receiving true and Christian justice, they are bidden, immediately on being born again, to preserve it pure and spotless, as the first robe given them through Jesus Christ in lieu of that which Adam, by his disobedience, lost for himself and for us, that so they may bear it before the judgment-seat of our Lord Jesus Christ, and may have life everlasting.

Sola fide is not Roman doctrine."
Teachers,fc2fxkh,t1_fc2fbqj,1577357977.0,"Justification by faith is one of the five ""solas"" of the Protestant reformation, with the accompanying doctrine of salvation by grace. Sola fide, sola gratia. The idea is that personal works are entirely useless in redeeming the believer against universal sin (total depravity in the Calvinist-influenced wing of protestantism). This is a sticking point against Catholic teaching that faith without good works is dead (James 2), although it certainly has its supports in Ephesians 2. IMO, this is a situtation where both sides of the centuries-long argument are (intentionally) misunderstanding the other's position, but by this point we're probably better off in another sub."
