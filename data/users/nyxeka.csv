starbound,fgnv3zo,t1_fgk10ba,1580953560.0,Added - see edit.
Stadia,fgng221,t3_ezennj,1580944106.0,Definitely not. Nintendo has  LOT of experience with this stuff and they would have executed it better. That being said it was still a decent 2000's style horror-story linear story type game.
waterloo,fgnfhgn,t3_ezg36w,1580943752.0,"Bit cold, she's probably holed up somewhere warm or maybe someone let her in. Hope the person checked under their wheel well and stuff"
educationalgifs,fglsob6,t1_fglpxo9,1580909971.0,"Definitely can agree with that, but it does give some good perspective on G-forces and what-not. If you wanted to spin 40 _Very_ expensive cameras by pulling them around a tight corner for several seconds at a thousand kilometers per hour, it's a bit tightening, I'd imagine..."
starbound,fgln5f4,t3_eyhoz4,1580905085.0,https://youtu.be/KmcGwdnmoM8 Some more looks and a slightly better (imo) projectile animation

harrypotter,fgkpdsn,t1_fgiuvwp,1580870693.0,You'd be shocked at the number of young women into HPLV/ ....
starbound,fgjxzg1,t1_fgjqk4w,1580853590.0,"In your personal opinion, possibly shared by others, but not me :)

Starbound is not nearly real enough for me to cater to the idea of logic and limitations."
starbound,fgjqkud,t1_fght82a,1580849447.0,Thanks! I've got quite a bit of experience both as an artist and a programmer so that helps.
starbound,fgjqg80,t1_fgjq6yx,1580849373.0,"Yeah tbh it would probably just stop dead if it hit a thing in either dimension.

Good thing this is fantasy land and Starbound is heavily laden with non-existent sci-fi magic!"
starbound,fgjq62d,t1_fghx9b2,1580849215.0,"It's definitely stupid OP. Also ty, I just drew it up with this mod in mind :)"
starbound,fgjq4g7,t1_fgig5v4,1580849189.0,Yes actually.
starbound,fgjq3qw,t1_fgihjcs,1580849178.0,Mod for the whatever cute saturnians mod.
starbound,fgjq2gk,t1_fgiqktp,1580849157.0,Not yet but will be soon. I'll post a link here.
starbound,fgjq0wk,t1_fgiw2fr,1580849132.0,"I'm mainly interested in implementing my own creations, this one somewhat inspired by Calamity mod rogue weapons in Terraria but I designed the scythe specifically for this :)"

starbound,fgjpxe5,t1_fgjb0va,1580849074.0,"Will be posting it soon. I'm thinking of doing a couple others first. Couple days tops.

I'm also thinking of modifying the projectile to more fit the starbound style, but we'll see what testing comes up with."
starbound,fgjpvhe,t1_fgjlrsa,1580849043.0,But what if it's operating in two different two-dimensional spaces at the same time?

interestingasfuck,fg8mc00,t3_exd489,1580624223.0,this makes perfect sense if you've ever seen a cooked rabbit.

Terraria,fg6iic0,t3_ex58wc,1580568892.0,Recode the entire game to an object oriented model and open it up to modding.

beatsaber,fg6hdox,t3_ex4azb,1580568016.0,I personally much prefer the modded map version by s-whatever at 8.56 notes per second I think? The one that's kinda hard but not like insaneee

TBH though I mean basically drones and self-guided missiles - you don't get worse than that anyways. Several countries have ballistic missiles capable of travelling so fast that they can basically slaughter anyone with pin-point accuracy in under 30 seconds all over the world...."

MMORPG,ffv7xiu,t1_ffthjqb,1580257818.0,"For sure, because that's how these things go right now, and it's kind of the meta with their game."
MMORPG,ffv7w3c,t1_ffto8z4,1580257791.0,"But you'll find that you can only update checkboxes once every 0.6s... A whole lot of the UI works on the tickrate. Idk if you've noticed, but every time you _change_ anything with the ui (pressing buttons, checking checkboxes, etc), it all processes on ticks - and that's how fast it responds too.  Things like G.E. commands, moving items, bank stuf, swapping gear, opening boxes, selecting which dummy to extract, etc...

But yes, it would be an entirely different game heh."
MMORPG,fftg1gi,t1_ffsnwvd,1580219505.0,"You're right, it's not garbage, it just makes it feel slow as all hell and unresponsive, even the user interface is based on it lol...

I understand why they did it but Runescape with dota-level tickrate, no tiles, detailed character creator like koikatsu or something and a modular input system with maybe more interactable and detailed environment would make for a wonderfully amazing mmorpg imo ):"

MMORPG,ffs0neg,t1_ffqm0dd,1580170265.0,"I wanted to do that with every single MMO I started playing and only Runescape has come close, and Runescape has the problem of its absolute garbage tick system and mediocre graphics (though the art is getting superb tbh).

Unfortunately there's probably never going to be a game that we want and that we're all searching for - anyone with money wants to just cash it in and make shitloads of more money by squeezing the whales dry and everyone without money doesn't seem to know what they're doing ):"
MMORPG,ffs0fqq,t1_ffqgcp2,1580170116.0,"Basically the only solution is something like Stadia or Playstation Now or something like that...
