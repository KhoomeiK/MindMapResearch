depression,fds1byh,t3_emws3x,1578692809.0,I feel the same way really. I look around and see everyone being happy and living a “normal” life. I live the same way as them but I can’t help myself but feel sad and empty but everything at the same time. It’s really tiring and I’ve been sleeping a lot lately and it’s really making me a guilty person. It’s just what depression is sadly. Fuck that. I hope you will get better though :)
depression,fds132f,t3_emwrc3,1578692655.0,"I’m in the same situation as you. I’ve opened up to a friend but I feel as though that I am a burden and I want to run away, but in reality you need to get your feelings out. Maybe I’d advise you to talk with him? And ask him about if he minds you talking about your feelings. I think you should trust this guy and get your feelings out, as well let him talk about his feelings too because there always needs to a balance in things. I hope you’ll get better soon :) good luck"

depression,fdrmemz,t3_emqbda,1578686564.0,"I think the only way to get the weight off is telling your family the truth; even if it’s the most hardest, painful thing to you. If you’re scared they’ll think you’re a failure, just remember their words don’t define you, they make you stronger. Keep working if that’s what you really want to do. I’m not sure about the med school situation thing as I haven’t entered even uni yet but I know that your weight will be lifted off you if you tell them the truth; it will get bigger and heavier if you just avoid it. Speaking from own experiences:) good luck"

depression,fdlfiom,t3_elqwy9,1578522915.0,"An uncontrolled amount of guilt from nowhere? Feeling like life is not worth living and we have no purpose but in a really low level.
Also constant disappointment from my parents lol.
I’m just tired of living and waking up sad tbh, I really want to end it all so soon but my guilt says otherwise...
I wish I could wake up from this “dream” that is called life, I’m so tired everyday and I just really want to die.
I’m so tired going to school everyday and working for something that won’t have significance after I die
I’m so tired trying to be happy when I’m not
I’m so tired trying to not feel guilty when I see my parents, all I want to do is break down and cry when I see them.
I’m so tired tired tired tired.
I hope a fatal accident happens soon, I can’t live any longer"
