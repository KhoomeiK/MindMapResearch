todayilearned,fg96rro,t1_fg8rleu,1580634807.0,Well a lot of us aren't that recent. Not a nativist but my maternal greatx3 grandfather made Confederate cannonballs and my paternal great great grandfather was a native.
mildlyinteresting,fg8osgg,t1_fg8kyx2,1580626983.0,"They say all those wierd laws have a precedent. Maybe, 100 years ago, a man caught a giant catfish and held it up for his buddies to see. Then cowboy Joe got envious, whipped out his lasso, lassoed the dang fish and rode off cackling. Everyone in attendance unanimously agreed that lassoing a fish ought to be illegal."

In my state, TN, no smoking in restaurants, hospitals (or grounds), retail, gas stations, etc. You can smoke in bars, which I do not frequent. I don't care if it's bad for me, why should you? If your favorite bar is a smoky bar and you hate smoke, then why is it your favorite?"

I enjoy smoking. Why are people on the bandwagon that my rights should be infringed upon? It's mind boggling to me.

There's a large portion of my fellow countrymen who think that people that want universal healthcare are bottom feeding communists, wanting something for nothing. I don't get it. I worked with a guy whose checks are garnished because of a 12k shoulder surgery who still lashes out against universal healthcare. Mind boggling, really."
