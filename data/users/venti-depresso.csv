I live in the PNW region and spend a lot of time in the county courthouse watching various trials and jury selections. When I'm not in court or in classes, I also enjoy reading comics. Right now my top 3 are Crowded, Miles Morales: Spider-Man, and Daredevil, in no particular order."
AskReddit,fensqoc,t3_eptxb3,1579290162.0,"After my high school principal took his own life, I found out that the rumors were true and he had an ""affair"" with one of his former students that started when she was 14 and went on for many years until she fled across the country to be away from him. I read the police report.

I'm sad that he's dead, because he deserved to be punished severely and to suffer. It's too bad he never has to live with the humiliation of losing his status in the community and seeing everyone who ever loved him (including myself) see him for the monster he was."

AskReddit,fdnzkxo,t1_fdmu9r5,1578596057.0,"When I was struggling with depression in middle school, I spent all my time on RuneScape. It was a place where I could be by myself and do things that IRL me could never do, and as I leveled up, I got to experience people looking up to me and wanting things from me. It was awesome.

I would stay up all night long playing on the weekends. Miss that."

FanFiction,fczdxc8,t1_fczdom6,1578099017.0,"It's exactly as tedious as it sounds. Scroll to the end, start with the very last word and work your way backwards. Total pain but honestly one of the best days to keep yourself focused while copyediting."
FanFiction,fcz8gig,t3_ejnrm1,1578095787.0,"I re-read at least twice, and make a special effort to pay attention to when I use the same word too frequently – mainly looking out for adjectives and adverbs.

If your chapters are short or you have a lot of time on your hands, you could read the chapter from the last word to the first. Since your begin knows what you wrote and is used to reading from start to finish, it'll sometimes hit autopilot even when you're trying to edit. Reading in reverse is a good way to keep your brain sharp."

Do your best to share with the world what exactly is behind your short description, even if that means an excerpt from your work.

After that, remember: your audience will never be 100% of the people who read your work. Pay attention to comments, kudos, bookmarks. These are your audience. You get to choose whether or not your audience gets to influence your work, or whether you continue to create.

Edit: on mobile, doesn't realize what a hashtag would do. Yikes."

AskReddit,fcjg1es,t1_fcjce8l,1577686258.0,"Your likelihood of surviving an OD greatly increases if you use around other people, especially someone who carries and knows how to use narcan – though, narcan is not a cure-all for ALL overdoses. However, it will reverse the effect of opioids so if you OD on heroin or if something you take is cut with enough fentanyl to kill (which is becoming more likely), it can potentially save your life. It may take more than one dose.

Many meth overdoses actually cause heat stroke, so if you can find a way to counteract those symptoms sufficiently, a person can survive. However, your best chance is to call for emergency medical services.

Source: volunteered with a syringe exchange for a year, learned plenty about this from the county health department and from clients who had experienced one or more overdoses. You could probably Google it, too, if you were so inclined."

AskReddit,fc458wh,t3_eg1qdj,1577406970.0,"When I was in high school, I went to an LGBT youth support group hosted by a local PFLAG chapter. The woman who ran it is the most amazing woman I've ever met. Every Friday, all school year for years, she dedicated time and money to a bunch of 13-18 year olds. She loved us all so much, and we loved her.

After I aged out of the group, we stayed in touch for a while. Every now and then when I go back to my hometown I'll go to the library (where she works) and say hello. She's always so happy to see me and proud of me, and I love her like she's my own mother. That woman helped support me through some of the darkest days of my life, and I would give the world to her if I could."

It's a really great way to get started that allows you to begin with a general overview and then go as in-depth as you want from there. Essentially it's a circle split into 8 parts, but you don't need the circle, just what each part represents:

1. A character is in a zone of comfort

2. But they want something

3. They enter an unfamiliar situation

4. Adapt to it

5. Get what they wanted

6. Pay a heavy price for it

7. Then return to their familiar situation

8. Having changed"
