lifehacks,ff96nv1,t1_ff8hspj,1579706100.0,"Thanks for telling me how to do my job. It’s super duper helpful. However with contagious viruses you need to be able to recognize, isolate and contain them. You also need to know the likelihood of exposure based on your own location. Ppl are traveling **from** China due to Chinese New Year. I live near SF and Oakland. What do both of those cities have?? Airports. So the likelihood of someone coming off the plane already sick is quite high, which means they’ve also infected the **entire** plane. 

Acetaminophen deaths aren’t common. Generally for an overdose you’d give mucomyst (smells horrid). The upshot is it’s an isolated event. If Johnny swallows a bottle of Tylenol, *you* won’t die. However if Shane sneaks back onto the plane knowing he’s sick because he’ll be damned if he’s gonna be sick in China, and he has a layover in Houston where you get on that plane—you’re screwed. You better hope I took my medical advice from more than just you."

So if it makes it easier for family members to know that an item is gluten free, and that item conforms to the FDA standards to be labeled gluten free, then I say label it. 

Also a lot of vegetarian/vegan food isn’t always GF so it can get dicey. Imitation crab isn’t gluten free.  A lot of BBQ sauces aren’t gluten free, ready made simmering sauces are sometimes not GF, most cans of chili aren’t GF...want me to keep going?"

Find a happy medium. Teach them independence. Teach them coping skills. Show them love and support. Provide a safe spot to land but encourage them to need it less and less.

Documentaries,ff577zs,t1_ff53q8v,1579582238.0,"I have no argument about the beauty aspect. I do believe beauty is not isolated to those with low BMIs. That being said, when you see 20 year olds with fatty liver disease you start to rethink the “I’m healthy despite being overweight” mantra. The thing is, fatty livers, gall bladder sludge, those are things that don’t really cause issues when they’re found incidentally. They may or may not tell you that they’ve even found it. Cuz it is what it is. 

But I see the read out on US/CT reports when ppl come in for abdominal pain. And it was one thing when ppl were in their 50’s and had those things. I mean sure, 35 years of eating/drinking choices will do that to you. But to be 17-25 and have it. That’s a whole other issue. That’s a fast track to medical problems starting 10-15 years younger than they’re supposed to. 

So no, just having a normal BP doesn’t mean you’re healthy. There’s a lot more than that. What’s your fasting blood sugar? How’s your gall bladder? Your liver? Your lipid panel? Your CRP? If you get those checked on the regular, and they’re all normal and you’re a bit overweight **then** you can say you’re healthy."

We’ve had patients walk over to urgent care in the hopes of being seen quicker. But the urgent care isn’t set up for much more than ESI 4/5 and even those have to be screened. We can take your garden variety sore throat, sprained wrist/ankle, ear pain, etc. but most else is still ED bound. 

But ED can’t triage *to* urgent care. I have no idea about this specific case, but her leaving the waiting room and going to urgent care is in itself not an emtala violation.

I was more concerned about surgical complications. In my case it was a liver. It was also explained that even if the liver transplant wasn’t successful I and I had complications I **still** would be top of the list. Because here I was walking into the hospital with a perfectly fine liver and I was willing to give part of it away. Trust me when I say they make sure it’s fine. They check you up down and sideways to ensure that."

The next generations won’t be able to really afford homes as “single family” and it’ll be more multi-generational living situations. I figure I’ll rent out the apartment and use the income to pay off the mortgage. But if/when I sell, someone else can have mom/dad/whomever there and everyone can have their own space."

Also I get the whole “takes a village” thing. I have several coworkers who are good friends who have kids. We’ve worked together longer than the kids have been alive. There have been times every now and then where some random car issue or whatever has come up and I’ve picked up a kid or taken them to the mechanic. That’s what friends do. I’ve **never** acted as the regular babysitter watching all kids for hours every day. That’s some kinda bullshit.

She opted to make less money and help those who didn’t have the same opportunities you have had. Also why did you need to pay for your parents and younger sister? What financial choices led up to them not being able to pay for their own tickets and needing you to pay for them along with their minor child? Why is it ok for you to pay for theirs and not hers (especially when she was willing to pay you back). 

You are 100% the asshole. Honestly if she was pissed at you for a long ass time. Like a little bit forever, she’d be totally justified."

It was with a totally different dept. I sorta just let it go, and the nurses found a work around (it wasn’t the nurses mistake but they solved it anyway). When I was telling my good friend about it (she’s now in leadership but not in anyway in charge of that person’s dept) she told me “you need to speak up. If you don’t we never know how to improve things. It’s not always about ppl getting in trouble, sometimes it just seeing things from a different perspective”. 

She was right. You were right too. Speak up."
personalfinance,fefeaa3,t3_eounf2,1579054477.0,"Where in NYC do you live and work? It seems like a vehicle is the first thing to get rid of. It’s not just the lease, it’s the fuel and insurance. That’ll prob free up *at least* $500 a month. Even if you’re driving to visit family 1-2x a month you can rent a car or take the train. 

I realize you’ll need public transportation and a subway pass monthly (if you’re not within walking distance) but it’s still prob cheaper. Also worth looking into if your job offers tax deferred savings account (sorta like a flex spending account FSA) that you can use for transit. It’s specific, can only be used for mass transit/public transportation. But you don’t pay taxes on that money so it lowers your overall taxable income. Makes using the subway a bit cheaper in the big picture."
