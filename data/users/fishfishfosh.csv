beards,fetekuy,t1_fetdntm,1579374614.0,Ok nice. That's better then looking like something you would use to scratch a boat keel
beards,fetdh52,t1_feta2tr,1579374222.0,"Ok. I'm going all in on an oil this Monday. I have this beard thickening serum with argain oil but it can't control my beard. Thinking of getting to a barber and get all the hairs in the same length, or maybe the oil will make it look better without cutting anything. 
Really hard to shape a beard without experience, tried to take out single hairs with scissors to look more even. But there are always another hair poking out and it's a neverending project."
