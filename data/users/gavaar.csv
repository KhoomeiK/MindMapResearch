LateStageCapitalism,ff8ia0p,t1_ff8d0ki,1579679732.0,These people are in way more danger than you or any of the people around them. The opinion you have just expressed is both callous and deeply selfish.
LateStageCapitalism,ff8i5i2,t1_ff88utd,1579679564.0,You seriously think that problems like homelessness and addiction are totally divorced from the economic system in which they exist? Do you realize how incredibly stupid that is?
