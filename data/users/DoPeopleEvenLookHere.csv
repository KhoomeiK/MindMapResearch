If the margins aren't there how do you expect compitition to get things cheaper?

If it costs a fuckton to fly, how are they supposed to make it cheaper? It doesn't come out of thin air. The fact remains if you land at a major Canadian airport, it costs you a fuckton of money. The airlines have no control over it."

Let's look at Air Canada's numbers

[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Canada)

$167 Million net income on $18 Billion revenue. 

That's a fairly shit ratio. 

Bells ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Canada)) is 23 Billion revenue to $2 Billion net. 

So if we take a look at the average cost of an airline ticket (~$176 from the article) AC would only make $1.21 on that ticket. 

Where the fuck do people expect things to get cheaper when costs are absurdly high? Part of this is indeed the new jets are grounded, causing additional expenses, and other factors. But this shows there's not as much money as people seem to think in Canadian flying. 

Down in the states American Airlines Group ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Group)) has $44 Billion in revenue to $1.4 Billion in net income. That's twice the revenue, but 10x the net income. 

Even Southwest ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines)), and airliner that only flys 737s, and is probably one of the most effected by the 737 MAX grounding, still has $21 Billion in revenue, and $2 Billion net income. 

That's roughly the same as Air Canada, but an order of magnitude more income. 

Maybe we should be looking at where the shit all these costs go."
