They say that the difference between someone who gets PTSD and someone who doesn't, from the same type of experiences, is how they treat themselves after, how they talk to themselves. Or in my observation, especially for more early life experiences, how people--usually their family--around them handle the situation, and life in general afterwards (and before). So to some extent it is about The Thing and in some ways it's about other stuff.

science,ff3ngap,t3_erc4h8,1579544806.0,"Has anyone ever made an intelligent effort to test the validity of astrology?

The reason astrology is bad at predicting events is because there are too many factors, too many possibilities, way too much latitude and necessity for interpretation, and the question of the skill of interpretation on top of all that. That's why horoscopes are so silly.

But the interpretation of personalities is more limited, and I've had great results with that. Although again I think it's best to keep it limited, because when you include every factor similarly weighted you get a vast number of possibilities and it muddies the water for everyone, skeptic or not. (When you've predicted everything, you've predicted nothing.)

Here's a study proposal. Get a bunch of people. Have their birth charts done. Astrologers writes up a page about each of their personalities, sticking to the basics--planets in signs, ascendants, that sort of thing. Then when those people come in, give them two personality descriptions, one of themselves and one of another participant, and ask them to choose which one describes them best. You could also have friends-of, spouses-of do the choosing. This test would have to be repeated with different astrologers, no fair using the worst quality materials to get the results you want."

""Online dating"" seemed like a term that was partly born out of necessity and partly ironic.

I really believe that health is individual, so when my friend with complex and unusual problems that she's been managing very long term tells me that she does best on ketosis, I totally believe her. And I'm sure there are some other people for whom ketosis is truly the best choice. But definitely worth it to see what she says.

From what I hear most people lose weight on AIP. Losing weight fast isn't always ideal anyway. Also a lot of people go into ketosis on AIP at first--I did--just because it's such a new way of cooking and eating and usually people don't eat enough carbs and calories at first. Boring diets of any kind make people lose weight, that's why all diets work until they start selling lots of processed snacks. Once you stabilize on AIP, your body will just work better and your diet will be so much healthier overall. It's a good jumping off point if you want to make further changes.

It sounds like you have compulsive thoughts. One approach--and I'm just tossing this out there--is to just label it a compulsive thought problem. People have compulsive thoughts about all kinds of things! Might be better not to delve too deeply into that topic, as they'll mostly be alarming. Possibly, letting go of the focus on *what* the thoughts are will rob them of their power. Also, could this at root be anxiety? You could look into treating it that way. It's been a long time but ""The Beyond Anxiety and Phobias Workbook"" was good.

When I am thinking mean thoughts (usually when I'm on the bus and don't want to be) or something like that, I say to myself in my head, in a silly croaky 'voice,' ""Grouchy, grouchy, grouchy!"" and it works right away. It's a little like labeling the thoughts by saying ""thinking"" while in Vipassana meditation, but sillier. Maybe there could be some phrase for your thoughts, like ""Attention, attention, attention!"" or....? When the thoughts of other people are intruding too much in my mind I say to myself ""Enough with the Peanut Gallery!"" You can develop counter-programming and tie it on to your pre-existing programming. I've also come across the saying ""Comparison is violence,"" which seems excessive to me, but there is some truth to that and it certainly could be motivating.

Another thing to keep in mind is that virtually everyone is lonely in this ""Bowling Alone"" world. It's the title of a sociological book and really worth reading at least part of. Anything you can do to deepen your social connections/involvements and enlarge your community... in healthy ways of course... will help, especially over the long term. Especially something like, develop a hobby with a strong local community element. Stick with it and contribute (within reason) as it takes time and depth for community to start to feel meaningful. There's also the possibility of a support group of some kind. Or meditation community.

I don't know if there is such a thing as loving oneself, so much as being loving and kind... even then it's never the same as the way one can be towards another person. I think a natural state towards oneself is a kind of neutrality, suffused with whatever vibe one has generally.

It seems like maybe there is a core fear here... on the evolutionary level our social relationships relate very much to our survival. So even when your thoughts may be about something seemingly trivial, maybe on an instinctive level it's a survival fear. If that sounds like it might apply, then you would need to soothe yourself on a very deep level... and also maybe to re-word the fears in a way that is more authentic maybe? Like... ""I'm afraid that I'm too isolated and I don't matter. -> There is time for me to form deeper connections, and I already have XYZ."" This could go in a number of different directions. One is therapy, and related books. Another is learning about how affirmations are structured. Another is studying NLP, but it's hard to separate the wheat from all the chaff I find. Another is studying Abraham-Hicks, but... it's hard to separate the wheat from all the GEE-WHIZ! (but it's worth it!)...

Probably want to see a dermatologist and ND asap to see what they say before you start taking rogaine. They may want to treat it with something else and be able to see if it's helping before adding rogaine to the mix... or that may not be an issue."

More seriously, I spend three years on a diet called AIP, which stands for autoimmune protocol. It's meant to help people with autoimmune conditions and/or leaky gut. There people commonly react to emulsifiers, which are often (but not invariably) in coconut milk in order to emulsify the liquid and fat. So it's a part of the diet that they are avoided.

And there's also a sizeable number of people who react to some or all coconut products even without emulsifiers. Something one is keenly aware of because most of the best desserts are at least partly coconut-based."

I would say that you're outgrowing the elementary version of your religion. But where you go from heere,e thereee are a lot of different choices. 

Many of your questions, there are good answers even if they can be difficult to effectively formulate. Some of these understandings are just not going to connect for people who aren't inclined to religion on an inner or philosophical level. 

For others, you've hit the nail on the head.

But I'm going to completely skip all that and come at it from a different direection. What is meaningful to you in religion? What does seem to matter, what does seem right or at least useful or moving in the right direction?

There are theeologians and teacheers and practitioners out there who are exploring/explored ideas in your religion with great depth, sensitivity, and accuracy I would say. Which doesn't necessarily meane that onee would agree with them or find their thinking powerfully compelling--but one might. What about reading them and then coming back to these questions? (I would ask around with otheres for recommendations--I could dig some up if absolutely nceessary, but have beeen out of the 'fieeld' for awhile and espceially hazy on what's Catholic and what's not.)

You have figured out that the simple answer offered in your religion is wrong, but what do you think is the true answer? For examplee, your last question about prayeer. You aree right that it is often not effeective in getting what onee is praying for. Does that automatically lead to the answre, prayer=stupid? Are there other dimensions to the practice of prayer...?

People often tend to overlook how even religions with long traditions are evolving things with in many areas much greater depth and meaning/nuance/sensitivity than is immediately apparent. It may or may not bee eenough of a fit, but it's worth exploring more deeply before chucking it."

And believe me, even without notable problems, it's SO much harder than anyone can get across, especially the first few months... or when you're alone with them and you're both sick for example... and some nights... etc. I never regretted having my child and am so deeply glad I that I did... but I did change my mind about having two kids! (If I'd started earlier, then I would still have had two, just very spaced out.) Somehow even though it's a hundred times harder than anyone realizes before having kids, my impression is that very few of the people who realize that say they would go back and not have kids if they could. Although there's a sampling bias since I get this impression from the type of people who go to playgrounds and groups and parenting forums, not the kinds of people who stay home and throw vases at each other.

Hm--definitely try to stick to counselors/therapists who are skilled with ASD.

It sounds like maybe he is dissociative.

It sounds to me like your post-trauma and ASD are mixing together here. Especially by post-trauma I mean maybe urge to control, and getting triggered so that a problem sends you right 'back' to feeling betrayed, etc. This might be generally applicable even if I'm not describing precisely the eform it takes. And then ASD--I know less about that, but I think sometimes there can bee an leeement of being rigid, rules-based, also trying to control, literal. And when things aree emotional they aree intnsly emotional and overwhlming and confusing. This is a little random, but it's reminding me a bit of how you make cement--which is apparently how you makee chocolate too! you take some common ingrdinets and churn them so much that they just meeld together.

So I don't mean to say ""You're wrong!"" or ""You're being controlling!"" by any meaens, but instead I would say--you've got all these lemeents and they're mixing togethere and becoming emotional cement. You're getting stuck in it. The processing is resulting in something unprocessable. It's not working for you.

I would try to separate what you think/feel is infidelity, and what is triggering to you. There may be some overlap, but the way of dealing with each and thinking of each would be quite different. It's probably more useful overall to be thinking of the trigger issue, for one thing beecausee you've eprocessed a lot around the issue of infideelity and it seems like so far that has gotten you entrenched into a dead end.

Govt can't screw around and then depend on all its citizens to make the best possible choices despite it.

AutoImmuneProtocol,fehfa9k,t3_ep13gj,1579115345.0,"Blame the doctors! (said wryly yet semi-seriously.)

First of all, isn't Amy Myers an MD? 

Second, if most mainstream doctors were smarter (and many other good adjectives) about how diet can help treat autoimmune conditions, *and the basic specifics of how that works*, we wouldn't all be kinda out there in the wilderness, piecing whatever information we can find together and sharing it amongst ourselves. For many of us, it's more effective than the information we get from our doctors. But it's a very flawed process and there are people who seriously fall through the cracks, who follow the wrong advocate or misunderstand something as it can all be quite complicated. The medical system should be integrated with this dietary approach, which is really just the application of current medical research anyway, for the most part. But this side of things is so irregular that it's often yet another big struggle for us. And that's one of the reasons people can end up getting confused or following the wrong advice.

You did your best in a system that is fairly dysfunctional, and now you are on track. You are now better informed and can keep learning more. It's a tough path and very few of us are proceeding perfectly.

Keep in mind also that there are lots of people who don't know that diet can make a huge difference, who are getting progressively sicker, but most doctors would say they are doing everything they can because they are taking meds and following their doctor's advice, they are harming themselves seriously and still getting an A+ from their doctors. That doesn't mean that we shouldn't see doctors, but they have their area and it doesn't cover everything unless they make the extra effort.

demisexuality,fehbxel,t1_fefyqkj,1579113396.0,"Oh I think I meant that stage in life. And yes also early stages in relationships.

Yes I am. Yes.

People worry way too much about missing out on sex when they're young. At this age, every year makes a big difference in how you change, and is a new opportunity for a relationship or stage in relationship where it feels like a more natural fit. If it doesn't feel like a natural step yet, there is no need to rush things.

Personally I do think that someone is missing something if they leave all that to a late stage in life... but I'm talking 30, 40. Maybe age 21 or 22 is time to start thinking ""Okay, this hasn't happened yet and I want it to happen, time to start being a little more deliberate about this."" If someone's in college/university it's much easier to meet people there, so maybe the late-middle point of their time there. But all kinds of different approaches can end up working fine.

A lot of the people who had sex early actually had it under more or less unpleasant circumstances. That's a sizeable part of the equation of ""normal."" You really don't have to worry about ""normal."" Unfortunately that's something people usually truly understand only with the benefit of hindsight. 

Anyway... if your boyfriend is ace, and you're not having a libido, I would just leave this issue on the backburner for at least a couple years. See if it comes up naturally on its own at some point. And if not you've got quite a few years before it could be time to say ""Okay! Time to consider doing something about this."" And, I'm sure, there's lots of other stuff on your plate."
