wow,ffbis3e,t1_ffbil7a,1579767243.0,"Yeah I always resub for new expansions because it’s new. I try my best to refrain from looking at info relating to dungeons, progression stories etc as much as possible. Eventually though I always end up reaching a point where I NEED to tune my spec/play style, because I haven’t maximised it’s potential in line with what people expect due to them already having checked out all the spoilers, build strata and boss strats.

It’s not impossible to progress from your own pure in-game experience but it’s certainly a lot more difficult to do so, due to everybody’s expectation that you should know everything before you attempt it."
wow,ffbdd5a,t1_ffbcx0y,1579760569.0,"Agreed, but also to add to that it’s also expected that you will be overgeared for most encounters now in addition to know all the fights. Take mythic+ in retail for example. As a DPS, if your iLvl (for those out of the loop, it’s a gear score that’s now in game that gives a reference to others in order to determine how geared you are) is the same level or lower than the loot that drops from the end of that mythic+ instance, a lot of the time you will get overlooked for someone else that has a higher iLvl."

wow,ffb8m8w,t1_ffb7l6r,1579755143.0,"SO much this.

Data-mining, online help resources (wowhead etc), and the media hype via youtube game commentators on patches/betas/future game plans; All of these combined with this ""need to know before we play the game"" mentality has killed the game for me. 

And it's unavoidable. If you go into the game now and don't know what you're doing, you get booted from groups, blocked/ignored by players and overall end up with a worse experience than if you just do the research, read up on strategies etc (thus absorbing spoilers in the process), just to be able to play the game with others.

When I first played wow, it was because my best friend at the time introduced it to me when I was at his house during vanilla. He let me roll a warlock on his account and I spent a good half hour just roaming around auto attacking mobs spam clicking the 1 button because I didn't know auto-attack was a thing and I thought I had to press attack each time I wanted to swing. At the time my experience in warcraft lore was a hacked copy of WIII and playing a bit of the campaign and dota.

At the time, the game was beyond great. I knew nothing and I was loving this newfound world I was playing in. I don't think I had ever felt so immersed in a game as I did during vanilla wow, and a lot of it was because I knew nothing.

Now having experienced Classic, I can say that as fun as it's been, it definitely doesn't capture the feel of playing Vanilla wow.  This is because you go into Classic and you know all the zones, all the dungeons and all the bosses. Classic is like reading a good book the second time through. Yes it's still enjoyable but you know all the important plot points so you aren't surprised or marveled by the events as they occur anymore like you were the first time."

news,fcvuvky,t1_fcuia2v,1578010634.0,"Nobody in Australia denies the events regarding the stolen generation. While done under “good intentions” at the time it was a massive stuff up by the government and should never have occurred. The “apology” was a bandaid solution that really did nothing, and was rejected buy a lot of aboriginals anyway after all was said and done, as it did not provide them with any more benefits to what they already had, or improved their current state of affairs and living conditions.

That being said, Indigenous Australians have so many opportunities laid down for them, to which most reject. They get interest free loans, they get paid more on welfare than any other race in Australia simply for being Indigenous, if they want to attend university they just have to say so and have a far lower academic requirement to do so. They also get more financial assistance while attending university than other students. There are plenty of jobs open specific to Indigenous people that other races cannot apply for. They have additional resources available from the government to find a job, that other races do not have access to. In public schools (I’m talking from at least 10 years ago and longer as that’s when I went through) they had additional support from teachers.

And yet with all of the above, many of them choose to live a life whereby they remain on the dole, with nothing but alcohol to pass the time away. If they wanted to become a doctor, they just had to say “I want to become a doctor”, and they would be given all the tools and assistance necessary to get them there. 

I certainly agree that the “stolen generation” saga was a massive stuff up by our government. It should never have occurred and is seen in the same light in Australia as the ownership of black slaves or the treatment of American Indians is viewed historically in America.

That being said, the current situation that many Indigenous people find themselves in is self-inflicted from alcohol and drug abuse, and the constant victim mentality that keeps getting reinforced within their communities by their peers. Compare the treatment of Indigenous Australians with the treatment of African Americans, and then compare the achievements of Indigenous Australians with African Americans. Yes there is a lot of African Americans living in shit conditions but there are also a lot that have made a successful life for theirselves with the means they had available. Indigenous Australians have been given more by the government in the years since the abolition of the racist government policies, but rather than utilise the support provided to improve their lives they have for the most part chosen to instead use the support provided to maintain the same standard of living without having to work."
