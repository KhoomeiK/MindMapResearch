You have a romanticised view my friend. Like most things, people think it's unfair and don't like it, but as it's happening to City their fans don't care.

1. Purchase cost (esp at lower end of the market).

Both of those advantages are being ebbed away each year and will continue to be until they are gone completely."
teslamotors,ff8t7ar,t1_ff8ss06,1579695178.0,"Sure. The industry is in very early stages in terms of transitioning to huge industrial scale production, years and years of experience in cost cutting and optimisation in supply chains in other industries can also be applied here. Exciting times ahead, I expect things will get very very tough for manufacturers of ICEs during this decade."
teslamotors,ff8sg8h,t1_ff8rir5,1579694317.0,"Cheaper is, of course, where it's at. Battery density is a key part of this reduction in cost though, especially when batteries are sold on a per unit basis, as fewer batteries would be needed for a given battery pack size when density is increased. Also, weight of the higher density pack would also be lower, meaning additional range for the same pack-size. 

Density and cost reduction are two side of the same coin, essentially. The real lift-off will happen when EVs are the same cost to purchase as an ICE car at the low end. Enormous international supply chains will squeeze every cent of cost out and rapid iterations in design and chemistry will reduce cost and increase density for many many years to come."
