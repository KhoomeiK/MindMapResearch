Yeah, I do agree that it is ""comedically juvenile"" but honestly though, would rather see dinosaurs than microchips, computers and numbers. I mean seriously though, if I saw a book about operating systems and it had microchips, computers, data types and binary, I would be like ""hmm, looks boring"". Not that I won't find the topics interesting but here is the thing...it's also a marketing/advertisement strategy. The **kids** are more likely to open up a book with visually appealing/attractive drawings/colours than looking at dull technical computer things; hence, chances of actually making kids be interested in the tech field.

cscareerquestions,fgk5bv1,t3_eyo4kp,1580857813.0,"**""Mind, I am absolutely willing to put in the work; I just want to know whether or not I am wasting my time.""** This statement right here. if you are ""absolutely willing to put in the work"". then you are not wasting time. If you truly have a strong interest in CS and if you truly want to learn CS, then you will learn it. If Math is not your strong point, then it is up to you to learn it by yourself because you did say that you are ""absolutely willing to put in the work"". Yes, it will take a lot of effort but if you decide to choose another career(which is perfectly fine by the way), it just means that you simply didn't want to invest the time in learning CS and this means you didn't waste time, it just means that you were not ""willing to put in the work"". 

Honestly saying, just ask yourself, what do you want out of the CS career? Is there another career you are thinking of? Which career would benefit you more in regards to what you want to achieve? If CS is the answer, then you are not wasting time, it's just that you will have to be ""willing to put in the work"", maybe twice as much work than your peers because your peers obviously have had a lot more experience with math. You haven't been exposed to math like your peers have, which is perfectly fine. It's just something you have to learn/improve by yourself. Do many practice questions. Math is all about practice."

computerscience,fghdgmk,t3_eyi4si,1580782387.0,"I don't know how your course will treat the students. I am enrolled in Engineering and the first year was a common year, meaning we had to learn Civil, Mechanical, Materials, Software and Chemical. In the first year for Software Engineering, we had to study JavaScript, html and CSS but we were not taught the basics. So, this really irritated Engineering students as most of the first year Engineering students like me never had programming experience; hence, the Software Engineering class was particularly difficult. We were specifically learning about mobile development and so the assignments were hard especially for first year Engineering students who have never programmed before. Honestly, I was very frustrated at the unit because the Software Engineering class expected students to catch up easily and expected us to learn the basics by ourselves. 

So, now I have majored in Software but even then, it is expected of us to know the basics of the programming languages I will be using in my major. I will not be taught by the lecturers the fundamentals of a programming language; however, they will provide resources, it's just that it is up to us to take responsibility and learn it. 

I have seen some redditors say along the lines of ""Everything will be taught from the basics"" and this is most likely true for your course and for the majority of the courses but this wasn't true for me and it's most probably because I was in the Engineering program and not in the CS program. 

And trust me, you don't need to be a coding expert. My best advice is for you to learn the language your course will be teaching by using a pdf book or by using any other resource. Just start learning, do the practice coding questions and you should be well prepared before the start of your course. 

Also, no need to rush. take your time and learn the language. You are already doing well by learning Python and say once you have reached the point where you have taught yourself the fundamentals, it's not a bad idea to try out Java or C++ to understand the differences between programming languages. But, it's also a good idea to know which language your course will be using and learn that, so it becomes easier for you in the class. 

Then, while you are learning your second language, have a look at your CS course and see what you learn in the course because you won't just be learning about programming languages. You will also be learning about topics such as Data Structures and Algorithms. So, maybe have a read of those topics and try some exercises out. 

If you do those things and by the time you start on your course, you won't need to be nervous and you will at least feel a little confidence going into the classes. 

That's just my advice from the experience I have had. 

Anyway, best of luck."

findapath,fgfbcsr,t3_exzmpc,1580733264.0,"I know what I am about to recommend is not in your hobbies/interests but have you looked into IT? Maybe trying to learn a programming language? You could be interested in web development/android development or even start a business in the tech field? 

I am just saying, if you haven't, checkout the technology discipline and maybe research about what software engineers do/what software developers do/ what IT people do and research about the tech field in general. 

Who knows, you might figure out that the tech field actually interests you strongly.  Because this is what happened to me. 

Long story short, had a programming class in year 9, I had a terrible teacher and I didn't do well in the class. Since then I told myself somewhere along the lines of ""I am never ever doing anything related to programming again"". I was studying Civil Engineering, started my first year in 2018 and honestly I couldn't see myself as a Civil Engineer in the future. I just couldn't see myself waking up and being happy to go to work. I gave the tech field another look, learned a bit of C++; this was the language that really hooked me... and now.... I changed my major and studying Software Engineering now. I haven't started but I have been learning Python and just started learning Java. 

So, I am someone who thought I would never do anything tech related and now I am studying SE. It's insane how one bad experience can affect one's life in a serious way. I still hate that teacher. 

Anyway, so my point is... try the tech field, or even just try something new, you will never know if you have the taste/passion for something or not if you don't take the effort to try."

IWantToLearn,fg67akl,t3_ex4t8g,1580557277.0,"I am learning Python now and practicing Python with the Pycharm IDE using a book called ""Introduction To Computing Using Python"". Check the link below.

[https://www.academia.edu/32234984/Introduction\_to\_Computing\_Using\_Python\_-\_An\_Application\_Development\_Focus\_by\_Lju?auto=download](https://www.academia.edu/32234984/Introduction_to_Computing_Using_Python_-_An_Application_Development_Focus_by_Lju?auto=download)

It's an ideal book for beginners and there are many practice Python coding questions for you to reinforce what you learned. The book uses the ""Python Shell"" but I decided to use Pycharm IDE as my university will be using this IDE; hence, I wanted to be familiar with it. It is up to you which one you want to use but I recommend to use a Pycharm because I believe it will help you to learn/be familiar with how IDE's work, how to save files in IDE's, debugging in IDE's and etc.

Python is beginner friendly and a fun language to learn. I would say learn start learning Python now. As long as you are willing to try your best, Python will not be difficult. 

Also, if you don't understand something after you have read a particular concept, make sure to research about it online, go to youtube, even reddit and just search for answers using the internet. Trying to perfectly understand something using a book will not always work. I tend to search online for further explanation if something doesn't make sense after having read a section from pdf/book. And guess what, you learn more from it! Be curious to know more and you will be doing well in Python. 

Oh and one more thing, when you are learning Python, make sure to try things out. Don't just do what the exercise tells you to do and stop for the day. Make sure to test Python and see what the language can do. See what the language can't do and try to get odd results. Try and make your own practice problems and see if you can write a Python program encapsulating the topic you just learned(Reinforce your newly found knowledge). This is the best way to learn a language, not just Python

Yes it was free range and I understand that but didn't the fact that it was eating your food(human food) ever bring any concerns to you? If I were you, I would have contacted the vet or an organization who are experts on Geckos and I would have asked whether it was healthy for a Gecko to eat human food because I for a fact care. It's a shame you were not caring enough and I hope you have learned from your mistakes and not cause illnesses to other beautiful creatures again.

""You tries to annoy me by using my name without asking the purposes of my name and my comment?"" Your very first comment was not helping OP at all and it never clearly explained what your intentions were; hence a person could easily find that annoying(not everyone of course but it did annoy me). That is exactly the reason why I tried to annoy you back by using your username. Just because I used your username, it doesn't automatically translate to you being fat. I never called you fat personally. Have a look at my very first response to you. I was being sarcastic when I said it. Just because I said ""go eat some crickets"", does that mean you are a Gecko? I don't think so. It's called sarcasm.

""Telling me to continue being fat and be a good gecko like an animal."" I never said ""continue"" to be fat. If you are referring to my very first response, I explained it above, it was sarcasm and a joke to annoy you. Please read my response carefully next time. I said ""good for you maintaining your bf and hope you continue to manage it and may you grow to a healthy human being.""

It disappoints me to see that you are taking this too personally, my intentions were to never hurt you and it was to never call you fat; thus, why I even apologized. If you cannot be mature about it, then it's not my problem. I honestly thought you would be more mature. I even apologized to you for might have hurting you because you didn’t understand the joke which is totally alright. And nope, you have no idea who I am. I am not “trying” to be caring. That's who I am and if you can't believe that, it is not my problem.

No, people are not stupid. People make decisions as to why it should be downvoted. Also, people make decisions as to why a comment should be upvoted and why do you think I upvoted your second comment? Because your second comment clearly expressed your intentions and thus deserved an upvote. If a comment deserves a downvote, then it does and the majority did not like what you had to say. Oh and there are people who will not read the backstory, keep that in mind as they can’t be bothered to read it. Or, the people who read your backstory might still have downvoted you after reading the further comments and they would have liked to keep you downvoted as they simply don’t appreciate what you have to say based on their judgements. Also, people can downvote you in regards to how they feel about a comment. If a comment makes someone say angry, then it will be downvoted. So, keep all those in mind as well. Sorry to break it to you but there is no “trend”.

How you treated another human being like an animal”. This made me chuckle a little because I never treated you like an animal. You have yet to understand my very first comment and how my intentions were to annoy you by being sarcastic and making a joke. If you are unable to understand a joke and sarcasm, then it’s not my problem. Also, I am glad you are not hurt and you thought it was rude. I did apologize as I do agree that it could have hurt someone if that someone didn’t understand the joke/sarcasm like you did, which is totally fine to not get the joke and hence I understand your frustrations. And you taking my joke/sarcasm personally is what has caused you frustrations but that's not my problem. Hopefully you figure it out.

Well, I expected more maturity from you but anyway, letting you know I won’t be commenting again as I believe I have made my points very clear but if you don't think so, it's because of your frustrations and negative emotions taking control of your good judgments and maturity. Go ahead if you want to respond to this but I am letting you know I won't be replying as I think we both know this is a waste of time. I know I might have caused you to not have a good day but let’s just forget about it and move on, I think it’s the mature thing to do.

Monash,fflw91x,t1_ffkn6rp,1580044957.0,"Honestly saying, Monash usually provides access to the units on Moodle a week before the Uni holidays are over(so, late February), never earlier. I don't know why but it's just what it is, which is too bad I guess. 

However, if you would like to know what you will be learning, you could always check ""unit guide"" for any units. The unit guide will tell you what you learn each week, when classes start, when the assignments are due, when tests are, how much the internal assessments are worth, recommending learning materials like books/online resources and other useful things. 

Do you know how to access unit guide for any units?"

Monash,ffjzb2m,t3_eu1epb,1580011094.0,"Sorry for not responding in regards to your question of the post. I am only curious as I might pursue another career after I have completed my current studies. How were you offered the three programs? Did you fill an application for the programs and Monash simply offered you the three since you are an Alumnus of Monash or were there requirements you had to fulfill in order to be offered the three programs? (For instance, checking on your WAM/GPA of your Bachelor of Pharmacy(Hons) degree?)

And in regards to your question, since you have an interest in computer programming and software developing and if you are willing/curious to learn/broaden your knowledge in the tech field, I personally would choose Bachelor of Computer Science as I believe the Bachelor in CS will very much help you to be immersed in the foundations of technology , also aiding you to acquire the computing fundamentals and simply allow you to explore the discipline. Then if you wish to learn even more, you can complete a Master's in CS/IT after completing the Bachelor's.  And exactly, the Bachelor of CS has the IBL program which is valuable and will definitely help you to connect with the industry and thus gain work experience; thereby increasing your chances of landing a job. However, this is my thought/opinion on it. 

Anyway, congrats on being offered the programs and great job on graduating with the Pharmacy degree!"

Monash,ff7dde6,t1_ff7d5nm,1579646949.0,"Right I see, so what you are saying is that Monash has provided you with pathways and the pathways are either the ""Master of Professional Engineering"" or the ""Master of Advance Engineering""?

If yes, then again, it is best to ask the differences between the two options from the Monash Staff who are responsible for the Master's program. Did you ask them about the differences?

If you want to decide the best program for you, I guess you have to ask what you want to achieve or what are you hoping to get out of a Master's program? Also, ask Monash what the two options have to offer. So, one program might provide you with more interesting research opportunities and the other program might be focused heavily on entrepreneurship/business side of things in Engineering. ( I am just making it up, I actually don't know what the program offers). But as you can see, now you can choose what program to get into. If you want more research opportunities, then go for that program or if you want the business side of things, then go for that. So, if you can ask Monash Staff what both these courses has to offer you(the opportunities that they both provide), then you can weigh the pros and cons and choose accordingly.

Advice,ff2nzpv,t1_feyfs1z,1579515636.0,"It's good to know that you have tried to stay in touch and who knows, she could just be uncomfortable to be talking about something that she is facing. Honestly saying, I have been with a friend since year 7 and I can tell him anything and he will always keep it a secret. He is definitely a loyal friend, he is more than that actually, I just can't describe how good he is right now because it would take more than 2 paragraphs. But guess what, we rarely hang out. I do talk with him via social media though and we stay in touch but we just don't hang out anymore like we used to during school and I guess that's because we are pretty busy now with our studies and he has his own personal things to deal with. However, we still maintain that friendship online and I do hope to meet him some time. 

And yeah, don't hate her for it, she really does sound like a good friend.

And you have done the right thing, to try and maintain contact, I guess it's a matter of time when you guys will come back together again. But in the meantime, go make some awesome friends and I hope you do!

Best of luck with everything."
Advice,feybewx,t1_fewpbhk,1579443240.0,"""There are people in my life, like 1 person, I sorta cut off but haven't fully - she stopped putting effort and I got tired of trying and getting told yes, to never get hit up. She was good to me back then, but I guess time passes and not everyone is willing to work on things"".

That 1 person could honestly be in a difficult time in her life. She could be feeling down mentally/depressed or dealing with something that makes her not care about anything or even do anything. Hence, why she might have ""stopped putting effort""? I don't know the relationship you guys have between each other(if you guys have been best buddies or not) but you know, it is definitely a possibility.

So maybe try talking to her again, ask how she has been. Even then, she might not be willing to tell you the truth if she has been dealing with something difficult. So, she might not open up, be quite and secretive about it if she is not comfortable in not talking about it. I guess the best thing to do is try and maintain contact with her. It's the only way to know the truth; that is, whether she is having problems in her own life; hence, not talking to you or she actually just decided to ignore you.

Just saying this because we tend to not think about how others might be feeling or how others are coping with life.

Who knows, you guys might get back together again and even improve the friendship, so, just give her a chat and see her response."

studytips,fefpp4r,t3_eowjm9,1579061712.0,"I am not sure if this will work but you go to these apps when you have the urge to, you just click on the app on the phone or type it up on the internet. What I recommend is, before you click/type, tell yourself ""NO, not now, I am not going to reddit(youtube or discord)"". So basically, when you get the urge, just say ""No"" and try doing something else, like stretching for a bit and focusing on something else other than the apps. Force yourself to not commit to what you were going to do. Do this everytime you get the urge and if you can do this for a month, you will make it a habit and stop using the apps you have mentioned.

I just came up with this now, you could try it, not sure if it would work though but you have nothing to lose, so, just give it a shot.

Edit: And like someone has said, deleting/uninstalling the apps do work sometimes. Prior to my exams, I deleted a game I was playing a lot because I knew I was probably going to fail the exams if I didn't get rid of the game. I uninstalled it and kind of got the urge again but told myself ""No"" and eventually made it a habit to just keep on studying. It worked for me because I didn't end up failing. But I downloaded the game again; however, this time, I am not playing it as often."
Damnthatsinteresting,fef6l8e,t3_eokgqq,1579049393.0,"Wait, so, this is a serious question: Why do people even consider living in America?

What are the benefits/pros of America compared to other countries, say a country like Australia?

Just asking because I have no idea why a lot of people try to go to America, I know people who do and it makes me have this idea that America must be a great country to settle in but after seeing this video, it scares me to even think about America.

I am just trying to learn from someone who knows how America works."
Monash,fef3no1,t3_eomhnh,1579047412.0,"It also depends on whether you completed VCE level Specialist Mathematics and Physics or not. If you have completed either one of the subjects, you should be fine but if you have completed both, even better. I didn't complete any of the subjects; hence I had to learn foundation mathematics and foundation physics at uni and they were difficult because both units were very fast. One lecture after another, a new topic will be learned and it can be overwhelming sometimes. Hence, I had to work a lot harder and I personally found first year Engineering to be the most difficult. Second year is definitely a lot easier I would say. There could be students who found the foundation units to be easy if it comes natural to them. So, if you haven't completed those subjects or if you have completed one of them, my best advice is for you to try and be familiar with the foundation units, maybe try learn it during the holidays so it becomes easier for you to understand at uni.

And considering your ATAR is 95, you can definitely do well in first year. As long as you use the study habits you used in year 12 and if you can work extra harder, be disciplined and if you can enjoy what you are learning, then first year will be an enjoyable year for you.

Best of luck"

csMajors,fed37jp,t3_eoiion,1578996534.0,"I was learning C++ with an online pdf called ""Jumping into C++"" by Alex Allain. Honestly, it's very beginner friendly, easy to understand and has practice problems after each topic to reinforce what you learned, which was very beneficial in regards to understanding how C++ works. 

Also, if you don't understand something after you have read a particular concept, make sure to research about it online, go to youtube, even reddit and just search for answers using the internet. Trying to perfectly understand something using a book will not always work. I tend to search online for further explanation if something doesn't make sense after having read a section from pdf/book. And guess what, you learn more from it! 

Be curious to know more and you will be doing well in CS. I am not doing CS but the line does interest me. I will be doing Software Engineering this year. If you have any queries about SE, feel free to ask. 

Hopefully someone can give you good resources for the math you need, I have some resources but they are my uni lecturer's notes. They are great but I don't think I am allowed to distribute it. 

Oh and one more thing, when you are learning C++, make sure to try things out. Don't just do what the exercise tells you to do and stop for the day. Make sure to test C++ and see what the language can do. See what the language can't do and try to get odd results. Try and make your own practice problems and see if you can write a C++ program encapsulating the topic you just learned(Reinforce your newly found knowledge). This is the best way to learn a language, not just C++.

compsci,fe7f6u8,t1_fe6qlwj,1578913802.0,"Whatever kind of science it may be, the test is quite accurate. Not accurate in a sense that it tells you what career path you should follow but accurate in sense that the test can describe about one's personality very well."
compsci,fe6lyqn,t3_enzuf2,1578895393.0,"Is this a test for yourself? Honestly, if you want to find out whether Computer Science is for you or not, it's best to ask Computer Science students about the curriculum and ask for advice from students/learn from their experiences.

Try to ask Computer Science professionals as well.

In my opinion, you could have a certain personality type that categorizes you into ""I am not meant for comp sci"", which makes you not even explore comp sci and give it a shot/try and see what comp sci is about. Who knows, you might actually realize that comp sci is for you. So, it would be quite unfortunate if you are letting a personality test judge what you are good at. My best advice is, get to know about the course and start learning about it. For example, look into data structures, algorithms or a programming language. Then, you will have an understanding whether it interests you or not. Also, when you have an interest in something, you tend to be quite good at it as you invest more time in learning.

I am not saying to not do the MBTI test because it is quite accurate to be honest, I am just saying don't let it stop you from trying things out.

TL;DR: Just because someone has a certain personality, doesn't mean that someone is limited to a particular career path.
