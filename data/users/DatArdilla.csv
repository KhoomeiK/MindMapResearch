I feel like a low key idiot but you’re right man. Stuff happens lol I won’t be so hard on myself. Lesson to be learned for sure. 

It is a good time to start working on it for sure! I’m going to try my best man. Thanks! :)"
Toyota,ff0zusk,t1_ff0yvjv,1579473871.0,"Nothing is poking. When I pulled over and It popped, I carry tools with me. And I got to work and took everything off that was left for that exact reason. 

I didn’t think about turning my tires to see all the way. I drove it like that. I was about 90miles away from home. I could of seriously blown out on the highway. My car felt so weird driving but I didn’t think of checking. I’m legitimately dumb. And it’s a front tire. I forgot I had roadside with Toyota so I could of just called. 

I posted a picture just right now."

There’s just a lot of noise I can hear while driving. And since it’s a Prius it’s always been very quiet. I also have full coverage and I’m still financing it so I need to get it good as new in case of any collision and such."
gayrelationships,feza6tr,t1_fez8g3v,1579455255.0,"That’s the good thing! You see who he is and you can use that to make yourself comfortable with the answer he’s giving you. If you’re comfortable with it I don’t see why it should be an issue my dude! 

And do you mean make a move like move in together if he moves away? 

What I loved about my LDR is how we could talk some nights and he would want to know how I was doing. ‘What did you do today? How are you doing today?’ And I know it’s a typical question. But just being asked and the way he did it brought a smile and smirk to my face. I could be on the phone forever. Yeah I know we are broken up lol but it doesn’t mean I don’t appreciate or remember the nice things in the relationship haha. Unless I have a bad seizure 😒. So there can definitely be perks to it in some way if this does become an LDR."
gayrelationships,fez5wmp,t3_eqykq0,1579454097.0,"This kinda sounds like my last relationship. He hasn’t come out. We were long distance after being together near each other. Was going to be moving around didn’t want to be together anymore. And all the school stuff. Broke up for multiple different reason. But ultimately one I couldn’t give him. 

I asked a question about us being together a few months before our relationship ended. Feb 15th 🙃 perfect day to end things. And he answered honestly saying he didn’t know he’d want to be with me while all this going on for him. He claimed ‘I don’t want to hold you back’ and I had never mentioned anything of the sorts. He was projecting feelings. And gaslighting me after. 

Whatever you do. Don’t hold him back. Ask honest questions expecting honest answers. 

This is a matter whether you feel comfortable with the answer he’s giving you. If you don’t feel like he’s being honest or you aren’t comfortable... you’re not getting nowhere. If you think this bond is great to withstand and you hear him say so too. Then yeah. Go for it. And go through it for as long as you can. 

I say that last part lightly. It can be interpreted heavy af though. It’s all a learning experience. We are bound to feel some version of these feelings. I say take it on and work it out. Talk to him. You clearly want to define this a bit. I’m not telling you that he has to be set in his mind that it’s going to work out because nothing guarantees anything. And that’s simply a fact tbh. But if he’s going to try and you will try. And you trust the answer I don’t see why not to go through with it. I hope this makes sense?"
gayrelationships,fewv6jx,t3_eqr7iy,1579419991.0,"He could be fucking around but he’s asking you??? 

Bro he’s fucking gaslighting you. He expects you to say yes. Like that’s not even a damn question dude. He has an answer in his mind. RUN DUDE. RUN!!! Permission? Like if you had a choice. I feel like once this question is asked and someone is monogamous and another is open. It doesn’t work. How do you really ensure that the person doesn’t resent you? It’s hard. They’d be hiding a feeling and since it’s LDR and he’s cheated on you in the past. Do you expect better? 

You deserve better man. You do. Break it off. Take it as a chance to start off new! You’ve been given a chance to find something better. You don’t deserve someone who’s cheated on you or will. Find your inner self love too man. :) and find yourself a good man who’s worth the effort and sees thing similarly with you. If you ever need some hyping up!! I’m here for sure dude!!!!"

This was also one of my favorite episodes. I would play that part on repeat 😂 and send it to my ex.

Edit: I also have a Vizio tv that I watched it on."
Toyota,fewsdxz,t1_fewcj4h,1579418775.0,"I don’t know. I don’t want to rule anything out but I feel like I would of noticed if I hit something. But the front bumper and stuff does make it seem that way. The weird thing is the bumper is broken on the drivers side and this shield thing and bottom bumper cover? Is on the passengers side... it doesn’t make any sense at all. 

What makes sense now is I had cars pulling next to me a lot and I think they may have been trying to tell me something. And I would just let them pass or speed up to let them pass. 

I noticed sometime during the drive I could smell burnt rubber/burning smell? I thought maybe someone else had like braked hard on the highway and maybe caused the smell. But then it wouldn’t go away. I got a bad feeling. I turned off my radio music. And it sounded like air or something rubbing. When traffic was getting more congested I noticed it was hard to brake and like my car was pulling. 

Eventually I got an extremely bad feeling and that’s when I turned on my hazards. And it popped off when I turned off to stop. I guess I could buy the parts. Maybe a junk yard? But for my insurance purpose I’d probably have to take it to a body shop so I don’t have issues in case of an accident. Or at least I think.. I’m going to inspect my car more tomorrow."
Toyota,few2k8l,t1_fevz2tb,1579404591.0,"I smelled something burning and as I would brake I felt something drag badly. So parts of it like sanded? Or chipped? I don’t know how this would even happen in the first place. 

Ive called the dealer to ask if it’ll be covered in warranty just in case. But if I replace it I guess $300 wouldn’t be too bad. I have full coverage so I’d have to take it to a body shop so it looks good as new. :/"

Overall I hope you’re okay OP. You deserve better than just giving and compromising. Hold your values and find better."
gayrelationships,fehfa9l,t3_ep5tt1,1579115345.0,"First off dude. You weren’t ready to take that step in the relationship. You wanted to feel better? Is that what I’m gathering correctly? 

And you’d give it a try when you felt like you were more secure and weren’t so insecure? 

And he still went off and had sex with another person? Especially on trip, away from you.... That’s cheating in my opinion. And I would see that as a huge red flag. It could make me wonder a bit if he’s done this before and hasn’t talk about it with you. I think I’d be really hurt too and have a lot of resentment. I don’t blame you. But he’s not being considerate of your feelings. I’d hope at least my partner would help our sex life get better and not just go look for it elsewhere. But I see this is something he’s wanted for a while. 

Did he talk about this before you got together? Just so you’d know? Because if he’s known since previous relationships then I’d also consider that a red flag. He could of told you from the beginning or at least some tome sooner. 

I’m seeing a lot of red flags and I’d hope he’d be more considerate since you feel insecure. That’s what my ex partner did for me when I opened up about insecurities. So why not help you feel a bit more secure about it. It’s not entirely his job to make you feel entirely better or to project feelings and be harsh on him but if he cares about you. I do believe he’d help you feel better and vice versa. 

You want to make this work and you really care about him. I guess I would just talk about everything and be blunt or at least I’m pretty blunt about things because I don’t want misunderstandings now. Be honest with yourself and him more. And I think you do deserve to have your feelings validated and understood. Get some counselings I guess. I think that could help you. 

I would personally just leave. I can’t change my values like that and I wouldn’t expect someone else to either. But it looks like you’d be down when you felt comfortable in your own time? It just takes a while. You’re really young and I’m sure you’re a great dude! I hope I didn’t misunderstand anything."

It is. It honestly is. There are certain things you could share but you have to know which things you’re projecting, and why. If that makes sense, genuinely ask yourself if your negative self talk is true? It never is. It isn’t and that’s what took me some time. All these scenarios were all made up in my head. Hence that self-fulfilling prophecy. 

Find someone you can let them have that punch and put it into a perspective. For me it was bluntness. I’m blunt as can be sometimes when something bugs me. And I don’t like when others aren’t so my therapist and life coach didn’t beat around the bush. Especially my life coach lol she let me have it. And I love her for that. 

He genuinely cares so he wouldn’t mind being that guy but he shouldn’t all the way! You’re on it! You’ll get it down soon! You’ve reach out about your problem, now you’ll get to your solution!! I hope to maybe hear an update when you’ve seen yourself for how awesome and great you are! It’ll be worth it. Invest in yourself :)"
gayrelationships,fd1ohqk,t3_ejuz88,1578134305.0,"Honestly when I was in a relationship. I had the same issues and I was actually vocal about them with him.

You’ve done the first step. Acknowledge the problem! Now you work on fixing it! :) 

I had big time insecurities about myself and I felt so comfortable sharing them with my ex partner. My relationship didn’t work out because of other circumstances. 

I would urge to find a therapist? If you’re in college they usually have a therapist/psychologist/ someone to talk to and hear and help you out. Mental health is important! As well as self love! I bet you’re a great dude and you should love yourself before you love someone else! :) 

If you feel comfortable with him maybe talk about such things. Open up a bit. But also work on it, just because you opened up doesn’t mean you use it to justify such behavior and I say that because I did a bit of that, it was a mistake but I’m in a better situation. I found that when I opened up about my issues I felt so much better and my ex would help me. It’s not his job to but he did. We told each other things we saw in each other and why we liked each other so much. It brought us closer and definitely helped the relationship! 

But I urge you to really find someone to talk to. I used my colleges mental health office and saw a therapist for a few sessions and it was honestly great. Although that didn’t completely help because I was ashamed about some trauma and never spoke up. And that is my fault. But with my current employer they provide us Life Coaches to talk to. Since they hire college students they want to make sure we have the proper tools to succeed in life. :) and it was with my life coach where I could open up about that trauma and fix it.

My life coach provided me with awesome tools and things to help with it. I have some of the things she told me. I’m not a life coach or anything of the sorts. I just happen to have gone through something similar dude. She actually sent me this book/challenge and if you feel comfortable sending me a PM with your email I could send it to you! It’s called Mirror work and it honestly helped me out a lot. It’s a 21 day challenge but you do have to put in the work to see results. And it honestly changed how I see myself a bit! I’d love to share it! I hope this helped a bit."

I keep hearing about stuff like this happen on this sub and many others. It’s crazy dude. It just depends on the damn person I guess. But this is coming from a guy who dates or talks to guys. Some of them are big time dicks, I haven’t had women do this to me. But I’m also pretty gay lol 

I haven’t really met or talked to many people on here. But I’d honestly be concerned about this. There’s something about FRIENDS that doesn’t scream SHOW ME YOUR PIPÍ! I guess some dudes forget English. I have a really good friend whom I work with and he’s straight. But I literally have such an amazing friendship with him that I wouldn’t trade for the world.

I got the card when I was 18-19 so I took the risk. I have the Capital One Platinum and they started me off at $300. Did 5 months of good payments moved up to $500 did another 5 months and have moved up to $1500! It’s a great card with awesome customer service! And they gave me a shot before any of the other cards. Even discover! 

I’ll second the Bank of America one too! Awesome rewards and if you have a bank account with them which is free until you’re 24 for students. You can link it with overdraft protection on your debit purchases! Which is an awesome tool to have! 

I also recommend going into a credit union. I have a credit union bank account and credit card! It has the lowest APR of all my cards with good benefits! Depends where you’re located though and the requirements for that Union. Unions are awesome because they can really offer you great benefits.

I started eating a small snack with the medicine at night so I didn’t go to sleep with it hungry. And it worked out! A lot of people I asked said eating something with it helped them.

You specifically mentioned a nationality. A social group of people from a different geographical area in the world. Who has different customs and culture to being undocumented. NEWS FLASH!!!! There are people from different countries in the US. It’s hard to even look at one of them and know they are undocumented or illegal. Why? Because there isn’t a look. They are just people like you and me who happen to be here from a different area. And you somehow assumed that because OP is undocumented he must be Mexican."
gayrelationships,fc7s3vm,t3_egn6ai,1577517203.0,"First thing I want to say is that I’m glad you got out of that abusive relationship! You don’t deserve that and it must of been so hard!!! Great job on your bravery! 

I don’t know if I really read where you guys defined this relationship or where it was official. Or if it was one. Maybe I’m misunderstanding. I feel that’s where everything should of been defined in what you guys want or are though. 

At the end of the day. You’re the only one who can make that decision to end this. 

But I think you’d be dodging a freaking bullet dude. You most likely want a monogamous relationship? So you should have someone who wants that with you. Don’t compromise or settle. 

You’ve already been through shit to take a slight step back. Be brave! And strong dude. This guy shouldn’t be on there for validation from other people when yours is the one that should matter. If it’s an issue maybe some sort of therapy could help? But that hardly seems like the case. 

He’s on there because he’s not taking you serious and basically wants to fuck. I’ll tell you this, when I was with my ex I mostly wanted him to find me attractive. I didn’t need to go on dating or hookup apps. And it seems like you didn’t need to go on apps either so why should he need to be on there? It needs to be equal dude. My ex thought he had to be on tinder too. I found tinder on his phone. But I didn’t go to the extent to make an account.

You did and no judgment on that. But I think that shows how much the trust is already broken and how do you go on from that? 

If you want you could sit down and define this with what you want. But if sounds like you already talked about it and you weren’t okay with it. And he was... And it sounds like you’re not willing to compromise and the trust is already not there. I really don’t blame you. You deserve to be happy with someone who wants you equally as you want them and isn’t seeking attention elsewhere. He has issues he needs to resolve."

I just responded educatedly to each of the points you wrote about in your original racist comment that you deleted. Have yourself a good night dude. Keep warm and stay safe!"
fresno,fc7ns1u,t1_fc7itfy,1577513673.0,"There’s a word I would call you but this sub has rules and I will remain respectful dude. Why did you assume he was from Mexico? 

You know illegal/undocumented doesn’t have a freaking race or specific country dude. He didn’t even mention his ethnicity or race. Or even where he came from. 

Racist people like you are why our country is divided and has problems. You’ve managed to make this an issue about a specific country and group of people. Feel good about yourself? 


I don’t agree with the politics of this state most of the time. Heck I don’t agree with our governor either. I don’t think our state will ever have open borders that’s just literally something radical. And some fear that people have. California does stand up for immigrants and people. While I do have my opinions on this immigration issue. I understand people want a better life and our immigration process is outdated. 

If you even bothered to research you’d know of the issues and difficulties in trying to even obtain citizenship. And it isn’t even citizenship. It starts as a visa and then a Green card. And after 5-10 years of continuous residency you can apply for citizenship. There’s a process. Look it up if you haven’t. And it’s not the same process or wait times for every country. Some wait longer than others. It’s a mess. 

For some reason people like you don’t want other races or people from different countries and you’re free to be think that way. By all means go ahead. You just won’t get very far dude. But the fact is. There is a process. That process is outdated. And our government hasn’t done anything to fix it. And we can argue all night about it. But it won’t change that fact."
fresno,fc7cb4a,t3_egj3o9,1577503263.0,"I’m actually kinda shocked someone is open about this. Especially in today’s political climate. 

I know field labor is high in demand. You’d have some luck with contractors who work with farmers around the area. They usually always need. And are somewhat lenient in verifying. But in the current season with rain and weather I’m not sure how high in demand work is. 

Restaurants are also another safe bet. Although these jobs can be a target to immigration raids. Well, technically any job because of your status. 

Some packing houses that I’ve heard of. I mean I know around Fowler/Selma. But they have also been big targets for immigration audits. And based on the political climate with elections coming up I think it’s safe to predict that there will be tough immigration enforcement again. 

California offers a lot of protections to workers and immigrant workers regardless of status. I’d be very informed of your rights! And what to do in any case. You also have rights under the United States constitution and I’d look that up. :) 

Best advice I can give you is to not say anything to an immigration officer official if you ever come in contact with one. You have the right to remain silent and not say anything to incriminate yourself. And you also don’t have to let an immigration officer into your home without a warrant. Look up how the warrant is supposed to look! 

Lastly to all of this, talk to an immigration lawyer. This should be on top actually... See if there are any options for you to regulate and fix your status (DACA, Visas, etc.). If not... at least have a lawyers contact information just in case."

gayrelationships,fc57ykz,t3_eg99hj,1577447837.0,"Wow this hit me. 

My ex was a top. And strictly top. He wouldn’t bottom and even me suggesting it would like trigger him. He’d like flinch and stuff. Not that I ever wanted to top anyways. I guess that’s why it worked out as long as it did. 

But literally when I read the first few paragraphs. I felt chills and like a bunch of feelings come at me. Or like hit me....Hard. 

I got dumped twice earlier this year. My ex left me and we recently went no contact because he told me he wants to marry a woman and be with a woman. And make his own babies. 

I had seen him prior and he was living with all these female roommates and of course we had been having sex and shit. But I could tell. I’m pretty good at knowing when I’m being lied to and feeling energy around me. And I knew he had a crush on one of them. 

When we finally went no contact. It was surprising. I was confused as to why ‘today’. But I’m assuming he’d already started something even though he denied it. Anyways, I told him. It’s her isn’t it. And he was like? Who... I was like. Tell me what kind of woman you like. And he was like I don’t know. 

Basically I was like. I’m not dumb. I know it’s her. And he’s like how’d you know... well first of all, the tension on his end when she walked in the room. And second, I fell in love with him. I got to know him. I knew when he was lying. I’ve always known but I was just scared of losing him....

My ex knew for like the whole year. Actually he knew by the 2 weeks in that he didn’t want to be in a relationship with me. I knew it too or at least had my suspicion but he told me he loved me first. And when he did I turned around and ignored him. I was scared. I had a different vibe and i didn’t want to tell him. I’ve also had way too much shit to even think about getting my heart broken so I didn’t want to. I did love him though. Anywaysss. He kinda led me on for a year? But I did too because I was inexperienced and kinda expected him to tell me. This just kinda proves who I was and who he was. I guess we’re both fucked up people. He kept telling me he loves me and most of me knew or thought he didn’t but another part thought maybe he could love me 🤷‍♂️. Or grow into it. 

Lesson to be learned. You have to love yourself before you can love someone else. And you can’t settle for people. 

He did ask me a few times. ‘If I don’t give you everything you want, why are you still with me? Or why do you want me?’ I realize now he had a point. My argument was though.... I knew he could give me that. I knew he could love me and care for me. I mean he acted like he did? And I think most of was genuine. But he did have feelings and other plans. I wasn’t one of them and I wanted to be. Unfortunately that’s not up to you. 

Another lesson. DONT EVER BEG TO BE IN SOMEONES LIFE. 

My ex was the kind of guy I was happy with too though. Legit! Even though of my fear and sort of knowledge I had. Yeah I know I guess I’m really stupid for that. But I forgive myself. And I love myself now. I can only grow. 

But he did make me happy. He was caring throughout most of the relationship. He would ask me how I was everyday. What I did. And we would talk on the phone often and tell each other we loved each other. Even make funny noises and laugh. I think about it now and get nostalgia. 
I was blinded though. We met up sometime in October I think.. of last year? And since we were long distance. I was excited and everything. And I saw he had been texting some guy he said he experimented with in high school.... he said he hadn’t talk to him at all when we first met. And then I found tinder on his phone. But I didn’t confront him then and there. I just shrugged it off. 

I knew he was looking at girls though. It was obvious. He had told me before he’d fuck my coworkers who were all girls.... and that time I felt insecure af and did get mad. And he still told me he was going to leave me on the road because I was being a bitch like he didn’t hear himself say that to me. But I didn’t even get that angry about finding the app.... I think about it now and I severely under reacted. Like this should of been the biggest red flag and just broken up with him. Love makes you do stupid shit man. I hated myself for it because I feel like I should of spoken up for myself more. 

I think you dodged a bullet dude. I really do. You deserve someone who’s going to love you. And only you. Who will see your worth and effort. I too thought I’d marry this man. Travel the country and own my little farm/land. While we fed squirrels around us. And maybe had bunnies. And a dog. I wanted a chicken. His/her name would be porkers. I’d own a badass truck and he would a nice Ford Fusion.

It sucked because I was basically left for pussy. He’s bi and he can be accepted by his family and they’ll never know about me. He never came out. Part of me feels like some sort of experiment sex thing. 

I can’t compete with a woman and I really won’t lol. It hurt like a bitch. I cried a lot at random times. Like I’d start crying midway driving and I’d have to pull over. I didn’t want to go out. He broke my heart. And there’s legitimately nothing I can or could do. I mean it’s his life. He will do what’s best. We’re only here for a short amount of time dude. We can’t be sad all our life. But we can give ourselves time to grieve and become better. 

Find yourself a man that will see everything you see in you too. Whom you don’t have to change because you like and love them for who they are. And who doesn’t want to change you. It sucks. I’m really fuckin sorry. Like I wish I could take the pain of it away. I would. 

You dodged a bullet dude. And you dodged it because you deserve someone who isn’t going to think of anyone else or want anyone else. I’m assuming you want a monogamous relationship? If that’s the case. There really isn’t room for him or your future spouse to think of anyone else but you. Or at least want to do intimate stuff like that with anyone else but you. You’ll be okay dude. You will. 

Take time to hang out with friends if you can. Talk to someone. Write! I did a lot of writing! And videos. I made a few videos of myself. I would watch them to just see what I was expressing. It was therapeutic to me. Just mirroring what I felt and how it was valid. Sing to your hearts content. Make a new playlist. I found that one to be a big one. There’s some songs I can’t or couldn’t listen to. And grieve. Let yourself grieve. It’ll take its time. It’s different for all of us but do give yourself that time. Sending you lots of love and positive vibes man. I’m here if you wanna talk 🤷‍♂️. I talk quite a lot... sorry if this isn’t what you’re looking for."

Epilepsy,fc3j123,t3_efsrig,1577390874.0,"I was told I needed to drink warm iguana blood and I’d be cured forever. 

And my cousin always tells me about weed. She would always tell me to try it and I’d be fine and yada yada yada. Like I hadn’t heard of it before. 

I’ve had other people tell me that I need to relax myself and not be so jumpy and so quick. Like I’m sorry I tend to tick and twitch. I’ve literally always been that way. Oh and that I need to go to church or see someone to get cured because I’ve been cursed. 

Let’s say my mom brought our local priest to talk to me. In my own living room. In high school.... he’s a nice guy and all. And I’d met him before because of my catechism class and helping out at church for events. 

Oh I’m also gay.... so my mom thought someone had like possessed me or some shit and that somehow my seizures had made me gay. I told the priest straight up. And he was like.... you’re okay. You’re made in gods image and was accepting. Or at least nice about it. He didn’t make me feel bad or anything. Which surprised me. He made me feel like God really loved me and I was a good person. And my mom was like??? 

But he told her that there was nothing wrong with me and he went about his day. Cool dude! Oh and my godfather is a deacon at church too and he was cool about it. ‘I know a lot of gay people and they are some of the nicest and most caring people out there. They also know how to save money’. 
That last part may be a stereotype of some sort but overall I’ve found kindness in people I didn’t think would. 

And none of these religious people tried to cure me or find something wrong because of who I am. They did pray for me to get better but I don’t know that I’d consider that curing me and shit. Yet all these other people read a sentence online or hear about someone else getting better and go nuts thinking it’s a one size fits all approach. 

Um no you dumb bitch. If it was a one size fits all or if it helped everyone you think we’d all be here struggling? Like what the heck man. 

My medicine seems to work pretty great. I’m not ruining that because you got an idiotic idea of how you can ‘cure’ me or how you heard I can get cured. I’m on a track to be on meds for at least 2 years before possibly tapering off and being without it again. I don’t need this sold out BS, I need to stop hearing it. I have to remind people that I’m the one living with it. Not them. And while I appreciate their concern they can really take it up theirs."
