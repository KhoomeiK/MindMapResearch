I take my income, pick ONE credit card (secure would be best) and pay it off or nearly off as soon as you can.  Then you pay insurance, med bills, cable or utility bills with the credit card.  That way, you get credit for paying the credit card AND all the bills, with the same money.  Lets say, your bills that allow you to do this, is up to about $450.  You pay the card you use, off or nearly off.  Wait as long as you can (because the credit bureaus will check your account about once a month).  If you can manage it and figure out about when that is, you make sure it is paid before then....and you don't pay more than 30% of your credit limit, until they check.  Once they check, you use the card to pay the rest.  its best NOT to use this card for anything else.  Good thing is, you pay that card AND all the cards you pay with that card, with the SAME money AND you get good marks on your credit.   It may not work for everyone, but it DOES work.  I have been doing it for a while now and my credit has went from about 430 to over 650 (it was nearly 700 once) in less than a year.  You DO have to be religious about it though."

Things like making sure its always pointed in the right direction and even then, keep it pointed in a safe direction.  One HUGE thing that most people do not do, is take the mystique out of guns.  By doing that, you tell them that they are NEVER to be touching yours, but if they ask to see it, YOU make sure its unloaded and you supervise them the entire time.
