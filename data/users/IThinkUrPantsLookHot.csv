BanPitBulls,fffjyh2,t3_et1jif,1579885586.0,"I feel insanely bad for this umbrella of breeds of dog. They were made for no other purpose than to kill, they are chock full of instincts and drive that get them hurt and killed or cause them to hurt and kill others. They can die in the most horrible ways at the hands of people or at the jaws of another dog. They die doing what they were bred to do, and even the ones that aren’t game enough to be dogfighting material still have the coding deep inside to varying degrees. 

People on both extremes of their ownership base project all kinds of things onto them: masculinity, toughness, being the sweet misunderstood outcast, intentions good or bad. They’re just dogs at the end of the day, and it’s time for them to phase out. No one owning one of these dogs is doing the breeds involved any kind service. The dogfighters aren’t, the advocates aren’t, and even the regular shmoe owners with the dogs that haven’t gone nuts aren’t."

fatlogic,fes9dhg,t3_eq9duu,1579362840.0,"I remember stumbling upon this term when I was at my highest weight and lowest morale. I loved the idea behind its original incarnation: you don’t have to do insane fitness shit to exercise, you don’t have to be 90lbs and super bendy to try yoga, you don’t have to do a complete dietary overhaul to start forming healthy habits around eating. 

You can start now, right now as you are. There are things you can do in this moment in the very body you’re in. You can go out and walk a hiking trail when you’re 300lbs, at your own pace, as far as you care to, and enjoy yourself not feeling any pressure to go far or fast. You can take a beginner yoga class or even get a video to do in your own home, it’s not reserved for “athletic small people”. Just to get out and do something to promote healthy behavior for yourself. 


I feel like I need a new term to describe my philosophy because the meaning of HAES has gotten so warped to the point of “I’m healthy as I am, fuck off”. Or did it ever mean what I first thought it meant?"

It’s just exhausting to handle and I hate that my default unhealthy coping mode involving food is  “eat everything in sight”. I want it to be “don’t eat for like a day”. On this end of the fence, forcing myself to eat seems like it would be a lot easier than reining in the slavering chthulu hog that is my inner coping beast."

BanPitBulls,fenwhn2,t1_feljge6,1579291893.0,"It always upset me when people surrendered dogs like this at the shelter. Someone tried to tell me it was because in their mind they think they’re doing the kind thing giving the dog another chance with some hypothetical someone who could afford the vet bills etc. But really they’re  passing the buck and the burden of responsibility to do the right thing, the real kind thing, onto someone else. They don’t want the emotional pain that comes with deciding to euthanize an animal so they put their animal through severe shock and trauma of being thrust into an unfamiliar situation while ill. Part of being a good pet owner is realizing your pain doesn’t matter and your responsibility is to your animal and what’s best for them."

But the propaganda just makes it unwatchable for me, and the idea that it’s encouraging people to “take a chance” on these “scary looking but good hearted babies”. I think about how many people would be influenced by this to get a pit and a kitten or take a stray pit off the street and into their home because of this animation.

 Grappling with it in a mindful conscious way is an extremely exhausting constant task right now and wearing me down. WHY did I pattern to food as my go to emotional crutch? Why? Why couldn’t I have the problem of not eating enough? 

I guess the good thing is I haven’t given in and have just been drinking water and making myself keep to my fasting schedule. Just because shit is utterly sideways and I feel like a worthless garbage pit doesn’t mean I have to eat like one."

BanPitBulls,feklyyf,t3_ephlo8,1579202815.0,"At our shelter, we had a German Shepherd that had been initially surrendered for aggression and then returned on quarantine for biting. She had a very clear and immediate preference for certain people and an extremely clear way to show she didn’t like other people. Several of us that she did like would take her out and play with her, always in our quarantine area as we did not feel safe taking her out in public.

She was adopted again after her quarantine to a woman that she liked immediately, as everyone wanted to “give her a chance”. I had a few misgivings but the lady knew shepherds and had taken some from us in the past and knew what she was up against. Well, a week later the woman returns with the dog, in tears. She says the dog was fine with her but was in the backseat and lunged at a drive thru worker from the backseat. She also came apart  at the sight of someone crossing the street and ran the fence for half an hour after they left. The woman knew and handled sheps but did not feel she could keep people safe around this dog.

The “team” of us who loved this shep were extremely sad of course, but we all knew what had to be done, what should have been done from the getgo. This dog was not safe in public and did not deserve a life of isolation to stay alive. Being a shelter worker does mean getting attached to animals, but you have to understand when human life and animal quality of life is more important. Props to the person who said the dog in this eulogy had to be euthanized. That’s the responsible, smart decision."

BanPitBulls,feeydrx,t3_eoiu1i,1579043930.0,"I adopted my dog from a shelter when he was eight weeks old. He was a happy-go-lucky puppy and was thoroughly socialized and obedience schooled and even earned his CGC. He still turned out rather shy and hesitant around new people. He’s introverted and unsure and avoids being pet or soliciting attention. People nod knowingly when they find out he was a shelter pup and go “ah, he must have been abused”. Nope, just poor genetics at work. 

He’s a very sweet and well behaved dog but you can absolutely see that he’d have been a nervous wreck and utter mess if he hadn’t had all the training and exposure he’s had. I think people vastly underestimate the role temperament has in genetics, it’s as crucial as physical conformation"

BanPitBulls,fdzztw1,t1_fdtbke6,1578799700.0,"There are a lot of people who came to my shelter to surrender their dogs for euthanasia for being aggressive. It used to be a relatively easy process involving proof of ownership and sworn statements witnessing aggressive acts. When the new director took the reins, it changed so that we would still take in these aggressive dogs for a surrender fee, but we weren’t euthanizing them because they could still be “helped”. 

I think it was a point of pride of his to put up for adoption a dog that was “on death row”. It also used to be that we would not take in for owner surrender to adopt any dog that A) we were told had demonstrated aggression toward people and animals and B) any dog that displayed aggression/unfriendliness/extreme aversion at the time of owner surrender.

That changed when the new guy took hold. We were told to take in everything and animal aggression wasn’t a criteria to rule out accepting a surrender. Which, fine, we’re not a private rescue group that can determine what we allow. But then we’d place these dogs up for adoption and be told that they “just need more training and patience and love”. 

That going hand in hand with the director’s shady non disclosure of bite histories (he of the infamous “you don’t tell people all your flaws when you start dating them, we don’t want to tell people a dog has bitten when they’re interested in adopting it” fame) made me scramble to find somewhere else to be. Most of the dogs that had been serving out their sentences there when I left in an ambulance after my attack are still, shocker, there."

However, a pit’s attack and bite methods are vastly different from a shepherd’s and they tend to do a lot more extensive damage because of this."
BanPitBulls,fdrsnda,t1_fdqd0w6,1578689083.0,But that would be so bad for the breed’s image!! We can’t have that if we’re reasonably certain the dog is sane today
BanPitBulls,fdrryca,t1_fdqyyi6,1578688878.0,"The animal goes on the floor, not on a seat. Proper service animal etiquette from properly trained actual service animals dictates this. The animal does not belong on a seat, that’s an indication among the vast amount of indications that this thing was a personal pet and not a trained service animal. 

Also, yes put down the dog for this sort of behavior as it is an immense danger to the public when it behaves like this. I think the equivalent amount of “restraint” in a human would be someone hauling off and slugging the other person in the face and then kneeling over their prone body and repeatedly punching them. 

I think a dog’s startled displacement of someone’s incursion into their space is understandable. A stranger pushes a dog out of the way, someone tries to pick up a small dog or accidentally bumps an old dog in a sore place. An initial startle or even a warning snap in situations like these is understandable. But a sustained attack like this on someone is not normal dog behavior, absolutely not."

She loved people, and was lazy af.

If you’re a pit owner, part of your repertoire should be knowing how to get your dog off of someone or extract the inevitable small animal/other dog from its grip because odds are that will be happening at some point in the ownership of your dog. You should also carry a breakstick with you at all times and have an additional $500-1000+ socked away in case you have to cover someone’s vet or medical bills.

BanPitBulls,fdgtinn,t1_fdglip5,1578407935.0,"This is absolutely true, but if the owner didn’t know the dogs would be let off leash, they have something of an out for responsibility of the bills.

On the other hand if they DID talk about off leash and the owner said it was fine to let them off leash then all bets are off, there. 

Me personally I wouldn’t let the owner off, I’d make them pay some of the bills because it was their dog. 

Of course, if the dogs are that bad that they’re mauling and attacking people, yeah, don’t list them on a dog walking app. I’m leery of getting into dog walking via apps or services or anything because of shit like this with dogs like these.
