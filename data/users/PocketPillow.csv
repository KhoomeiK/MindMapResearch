What literally happened was they eliminated 3 jobs and put customers and machines in charge of the labor.

Only 11 means 33 next year without taking from other years, and since lots of kids from USC go pro as soon as they're eligible, you might be able to do more. 

30-35 recruits alone will get your ranking in the top 20 even if they're just your standard guys.  Throw a couple 5*'s including the #1 overall guy on top of that and you'll be in the top 10.

Additionally the South is weak this year with Utah losing most of their good players.  A reloading Utah, Arizona St., and USC will be in good competition for the division.  I'd put my money on ASU, but USC could absolutely win the division.

CFB,fd4sb8m,t1_fd4paxu,1578170641.0,"Give it time.  Korey Foreman's primary recruiter is Nansen, who was your recruiting coordinator this cycle after being demoted last year.  He's not too good at his job and will definitely be fired with Helton.  Wouldn't be shocked if he were made an example of after signing day after this failure. 

Meanwhile they Ducks are one of 3 teams he's mentioned frequently with the Trojans and Crimson Tide and are further ahead in his recruitment right now than we were at this time for Kayvon Thibodeaux.  

Everyone wants him, but 3 schools have the inside track, Ducks being one of them.  My hope was that we could get Gary Bryant Jr this year to go with Seven McGee next year and they'd peer recruit the shit out  of him."

CFB,fd4oqx9,t3_ek1sfl,1578169490.0,"Fuck. 

We already have one of his teammates, but 2 more of his teammates are high targets for the Ducks next year.

I felt like if we could pull him off USC we'd be able to ensure ourselves the other 2 next year to go with the 2 we already have from Centennial."

AskReddit,fd1bzyg,t1_fd05ldt,1578129616.0,"It took me until I was in my 30s to realize that my family only had 2 things for me: Judgements and Demands. 

It was always covered in loving language, hugs, and smiles... but I never experienced acceptance or support.  I had a slow dawning realization over the course of a year that I was never supported in anything I did unless it was what my family told me I should be doing.  Whenever I talked about the things that were going well (with something they didn't prescribe for me) all they had was judgments about what was wrong with it.  All negativity, no positivity. 

It was very unhealthy.  

Everything from my career choice to dating a woman with kids and so on.  Nothing was ever good enough unless I was submissively going along with what they demanded I do. 

Judgements and Demands.  Just unhealthy psychologically."
