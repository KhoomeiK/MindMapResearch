It's not slavery, it's a job, and *some* (I don't follow Hollywood so I'm pretty ignorant I'm who raped who) of these women that have sex with men, and then reap rewards, and go back to have sex with men to reap more rewards later aren't victims or actresses, they're prostitutes, exchanging sex for rewards. 

IM NOT SAYING that rape isn't a thing, IT IS, but if you tell me somebody raped you, then gave you something, AND THEN YOU GO BACK FOR MORE, I'm going to have a hard time having sympathy for you."

Epstein paid for her to study abroad. She says he raped her but then she traveled to France with him. Then he ""raped"" her again and she again, traveled elsewhere with him.
She's not a victim, she's a whore. She exchanged sex for vacations few can ever dream of and, oh, for a fucking study abroad scholarship."

nottheonion,fdqvr9q,t1_fdpe21p,1578675592.0,"If you use the military as an analogy, the whole country/ government is already on a single network and look how bad we the taxpayers get fucked over.

The ""collective defense bargaining"" that is the Pentagon asks for a Plane, 

the Military-industrial complex is like ""It'll be $50million"" 

The Pentagon says ""we can't sell that to the taxpayers""

MIC: ""ok, it'll be $30million""

and a few months into development later, the MIC goes ""yo' we need another $20million""

Pentagon:""You said you could do this for $30million! No way we're giving you $20million""

MIC: "" So you're just going to throw away those $30million?""

Pentagon:"" Fine, here's 20million""

MIC:"" You mean $25million""


And there's no way Boeing, BAE, or Lockheed will be held accountable. Every once in a while they'll slap a fine, but we're not getting our money's worth. 

If the health sector operated like the defense sector and said ""hey we actually need more money"" the government would just laugh."

The ones shot by ""the only people who should have guns"" (military and police)

It's the price to pay. Just like the 36,000 people who died last year for the convenience of driving a car and not walking. 

I'm not saying it's right or natural or good in any way shape or form that children died at the hands of guns, but I don't think disarming citizens is the answer. 

Making restrictions on who can own a weapon isn't the answer either. It's like eugenics, sounds good, but who decides who is worthy?"
AskReddit,fcvint5,t1_fcusegh,1578002902.0,That's not good though. Why ask for more regulation of your personal freedoms. The thing about personal freedoms is that you can choose not to exercise them. Don't buy a gun.

todayilearned,fcnhavx,t1_fcmkfqd,1577811696.0,"Right?!

Another example I saw online. Someone complained on Yelp about how a restaurant charged someone $1 for a water with lemon, they argued that the material costs involved ($0.000001 for the water and $0.07 for the lemon slice) should make it free.

The opener was like ""Well, I had to pay for the water, and the lemon slice, and the dishwasher to wash your cup before and after you used it. The space and the chair you sat on, and I had to pay an employee $0.50 for the time it took him to prepare your lemon slice water, and 4% directly to Visa, and pay the cashier for the time it took him to process your payment""

Sure, it'd be nice for everything to be free, but SOMEONE has to pay for it. The government doesn't pay for shit, the taxpayers do. We should all have that in mind anytime someone says ""the government should provide free (healthcare/ contraception/ abortions/ guns)"""

I'll see some posts sometimes about how someone goes to the hospital and they get charged $70 for a band-aid and $200 for the hospital bed. But if that's all they used then they didn't really need that hospital bed to get a band-aid applied. 

I saw how there was a queue of ambulances because the NHS hospital was at and over capacity. It's easy to go to the hospital if it's free."

Stick to brands that ethnic people haven't heard in their favourite rap songs; Vacheron, Stowa, Omega, Bell & Ross, and as we can see here, Al&S"
