TrueOffMyChest,ffg7l1a,t1_ffg48tg,1579900176.0,"i’ve only ever been sexually attracted to people i know very well and have romantic feelings for. and most of the people i’ve ever known haven’t been very close to me. i’ve maybe had five really good friends my whole life, otherwise i keep people from a distance because i have major trust issues regarding friends.


also the definition claimed in the post doesn’t match up to the actual definition of demisexuality. try googling it. and like you said, you don’t really know me at all, or my background or the full extent of why i believe i’m demisexual, so i’d prefer if you didn’t try to tell me i wasn’t. it’s typically not something people like.


also, i don’t live by the labels i choose. i use them to simplify myself and make sense of myself to an extent, but i don’t just sit inside boxes and let them define me. the only reason people know i’m queer is because they know who i’m dating. the only reason people know i’m trans is because they’ve known me since before i was trans, and because i’m still pre transition and it’s very obvious i’m trans. i generally keep to myself, but i don’t shy away from telling someone the deal when they ask. i don’t think my use of labels is in any way doing harm to me."
TrueOffMyChest,fffql9e,t1_ffffcyo,1579889658.0,"on a separate note, i feel like a lot of these people screaming and making a big hoopla about nothing are people that are just confused about what we’re supposed to be fighting for. we’re fighting against oppression, against the days of being murdered for dressing ‘like a fag’ or holding your partner’s hand or kissing your partner in public. this doesn’t happen nearly as much as it used to, but there is still a lot of workplace discrimination. i feel like the on my scenario where your identity is constantly plastered on your face and an every day issue where it really matters whether people respect your identity is with trans people. a large part of their existence revolves around the fact that they’re trans."
TrueOffMyChest,fffpygd,t1_ffffcyo,1579889264.0,"i feel like it’s a good way to identify yourself and kind of simplify the way you view your sexual preferences, but if you’re straight and demisexual it doesn’t make you part of the community. i think it’s often viewed as part of the community because a lot of people that are already part of the community (gay, lesbian bi, etc) identify as demisexual. 


i’m queer and trans and i identify as demisexual. i thought i was asexual for the longest time because i’d never felt sexual attraction to anyone, and never thought i’d be able to because i didn’t even know where to start. i’ve only ever been sexually attracted to two people and i’ve only ever considered having sex with one of them. it’s a good label to use to figure yourself out but i feel like it’s kind of a neutral thing that just exists more so on a scale of how comfortable you are with sex. it’s not exclusively LGBT."
TrueOffMyChest,fffonca,t3_et5f4s,1579888455.0,"i feel like it isn’t notable enough to say it’s not a part of the community. identifying as demisexual doesn’t harm the community or stigmatize it or draw attention away from other orientations. it’s also not unrealistic. 


but there are a lot of people that exclusively have sex with people they feel extremely comfortable with. it’s definitely not everyone. there are loads of people that have one night stands and sleep around and have no problem with it, and it’s not anything to judge. it’s just two different takes on sexuality. it’s not really so much of an orientation as in “who am i attracted to” in terms of gender but “who am i attracted to” in terms of how you’re comfortable sexually. 


i feel like it’s still valid and a still deserves to be part of the community. and honestly at the end of the day it’s a label. it’s a word that simplifies an idea or situation or point of view or whatever. it does its job. it’s just easier for people to say theyre demisexual than it is for people to explain their situation in extensive detail.


edit: i am demisexual. from what i’ve seen theres something that seems to be unique to demisexual people that sets them apart from people who are more strict about who they have sex with. i literally am not attracted to anyone at all until i have formed a deep emotional bond with them. i can’t get off to porn, i don’t find strangers or celebrities hot past a way that’s just aesthetic attraction (being able to acknowledge that they look nice or whatever). i am completely incapable of being attracted to someone sexually unless that bond is there. as far as i’m concerned that’s not typical."

NoStupidQuestions,fdn2cg3,t1_fbbafvy,1578575188.0,"(i know i’m about to sound like an asshole but hear me out)
i’m not a psychic, but i’m an empath. i occasionally communicate with the deceased. a lot of the people in my life know i can do this because i’m pretty open about my craft. 


most of the time whenever i contact someone’s loved one, they contacted me out of nowhere. i tell that person what i heard for free, it feels wrong to charge money for it. it’s not a business transaction, it’s communication that 
unfortunately, not everyone can do. 

my friend’s grandma died a month ago and asked me to contact her. i did it for free. there’s no way i could ever make money off of that and feel good about it. i won’t take money even if people offer it.

when i tell these people what i hear from the deceased, it never ends there. i’ve seen a fair amount of deaths in my family, i figured out how to cope with it with the help of my religion. i never push my beliefs or faith onto other people, but sometimes hearing it from someone else’s perspective can help you deal with it better, or at least get you thinking. 


that being said i am disgusted by all of these fake ‘psychics’ claiming they have the ability to talk to the deceased, discrediting our craft, taking advantage of vulnerable grieving people. i hate it, it’s awful. but it also hurts to see people take opportunities like this to completely discredit everyone who practices this craft. thank you for hearing me out."
NoStupidQuestions,fdn0ywb,t3_ecdcwz,1578573911.0,"that’s immoral as hell and incredibly fucked. i’m sorry you’re all going through that. i haven’t really seen anyone talking about the ‘psychic’ aspect of this so here’s a few quick pointers to sort out the potentially real ones from the fake ones. (by potentially real, i mean more legitimate. still depends whether you believe their work is even legitimate.)


0.) never let yourself be coaxed into telling this person anything about the person they’re attempting to contact. if they ask you things, answer yes or no. no specific details, even if you think they’re super general. if they aren’t able to elaborate, they’re fake.


1.) anyone who doesn’t know you will never have the ability to decide to contact a deceased loved one. how would they know that person is deceased if they’ve never met you? if someone approaches you saying this before you’ve told them anything, especially if they ask for money before they tell you anything, they’re fake.


2.) a lot people with these abilities are contacted by the deceased, rather than being able to contact them in a matter of minutes. from my experience at least, a lot of times when you try to contact someone rather than them contacting you, they don’t wanna talk. a deceased loved one being instantly willing to talk is a minor red flag.


3.) if they ask for an obscene amount of money, regardless of how far into the process they are, (especially right off the bat) they’re either fake or they have a very inflated ego.


4.) ‘psychics’ who have ads online are obviously scammers. if one contacts you in a comment section or a direct message in light of you talking about something that happened, they could be legitimate or they could be trying to play off of your grief. with social media, you can always check their page. if they have no posts, it’s not worth the risk. if they look sketchy, block them. you can usually tell the real ones from the fake ones by the way they talk about themselves and their practice.


5.) there are certain things that separate real and fake ‘psychics’ in terms of vocabulary. real ‘psychics’ for the most part won’t call themselves such. some people prefer to call themselves empaths, energy workers, necromancers, etc. there are a few ‘psychics’ who call themselves psychics or clairvoyants, but most are fake as these words are far more commonly understood as spiritual, and fakes often won’t look into the practice.


6.) from my experience, most real ‘psychics’ won’t ask you for money. you’ll never see a legitimate practitioner come up to someone and say “for $20 i’ll tell you what your dead wife thinks about you.” if someone approaches you with information about a deceased loved one, and doesn’t want money in return, you can most likely trust what they’re about to say. 


source: i’m a wiccan and a witch, and i specialize in divination and necromancy. i always have a tarot deck and a pendulum on hand. if i’ve ever felt the need to give someone a tarot reading, it’s always free. if someone’s deceased loved one contacts me or someone i know wants me to contact one for them, it’s always free. i don’t feel the need to profit off of these skills or gifts, whatever you may call them. it feels unjust to me. i get paid in their contentment and relief, and the opportunity to further hone my skills."

if he decides not to de-escalate or decides to ‘retaliate’ to what iran did, we may very well have a war on our hands. those will be our troops putting their lives on the line because of our shitty president. they enlisted in the military to serve and protect this country, not so they could die on behalf of some asshole in D.C. that, mind you, gets to kick his feet up on his desk and watch, and not worry about the war.


it’s easy for people in congress that have never seen war to want it, to vote for it, to wish for it. but that’s not fair to the people who have seen it, or the people who have family in the military because we, the people, will be the ones fighting it. i’m absolutely infuriated by the audacity of trump. how dare he put american lives on the line for a selfish and inconceivable cause? how dare he abuse their service?"

i felt this way when i realized i was non-binary. trying to find my ‘style’ was really frustrating when people around me kept trying to put me in boxes i never said i wanted to be in, and then complaining when i didn’t fit into them seamlessly. i would have had a much easier time if those people had just tried to understand me and what i felt without trying to drive-by label me so they wouldn’t have to think about it. it was so hard to start changing the way i wanted to look and be perceived without everyone else making me play tug of war with gender binaries.



p.s. an important thing i wanna note for anyone who isn’t cis that reads this: you don’t have to have one specific style. you’re allowed to be eclectic. just wear whatever the hell is comfortable and don’t worry about whether other people think you’re inconsistent. wear goth fashion one day and pastel fashion the next and hypebeast the next. just do you.
