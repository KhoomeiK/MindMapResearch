it also gave me a terrible taste in my mouth??? like coins almost lmao. the first symptom is less common than the second one, which is pretty common. i quit cold turkey which is super dangerous."

Let’s just say I had some horrid side effects. But I really hope you don’t experience any of the ones I did. I hope it helps you!"

EDAnonymous,feluter,t3_ept9cj,1579231476.0,"oh my god. i am not trying to scare you. but bless your heart. 

usually for me it takes ~6 hours. so on sunday, the day before my first day of the new semester, i decide to have a mug around 5 pm. i’m like ok cool, it’ll hit me ~10-12, and i usually go to sleep at 12, so i was fine. 

oh boy. was i wrong. i wake up at 3 am with these debilitating cramps. sh*t my brains out, and fell back to sleep. and that’s how i started this semester off. shitting my brains out at 3 am because i didn’t time my tea well enough."

PennStateUniversity,fe5unkh,t3_envm8i,1578875334.0,"From what I understand, the grade forgiveness policy is not applicable for courses taken prior to when it is implemented. 

This may mean that the C you hypothetically get this semester will not replace the D you received previously just because this policy was implemented at a later time. I am unsure if this is actually the case, but I hope the best for you regardless!"
college,fe5u3au,t3_envzzl,1578874964.0,I don’t have advice but I’m wishing you the best. I know the feeling of having to go back and dreading it (me today). I hope it all works out for you!
