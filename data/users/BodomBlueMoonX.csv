AskReddit,fe6is5w,t1_fe6htxr,1578892227.0,Been waiting for something good to happen for a long time and still nothing has come.
AskReddit,fe6gek0,t1_fe6cwvl,1578890108.0,"Lucky. I wish stuff like this happened to me. Instead I just get proved more right every day. That life is not my friend. I legitimately do want to be happy for you, but it’s hard to when you know stuff like this will never happen to you, that you’re hated and treated like trash."
dating_advice,fdi4bv0,t1_fdhuful,1578435496.0,She’s obviously someone who has never been depressed. Otherwise they’d be more empathetic to people with depression.
dating_advice,fdi3zpp,t3_eleoxp,1578435326.0,"I wouldn’t do that. Some people really need love. They can’t help being depressed. The worst part of having a mental illness is your expected to act like you don’t. I don’t care if anyone wants to attack me for saying this, but abandoning someone because of a mental illness is cruel. Society in general isn’t nice to the mentally ill. Now if he’s being abusive that’s a different story. As someone who deals with depression myself this just feels like a personal attack."
feminineboys,fdhpmzi,t1_fdgqixz,1578427662.0,"I’m 6’2, wanna trade?"
feminineboys,fdhpkh5,t3_elakag,1578427620.0,"Yes! Absolutely! I’m 6’2, I wanna be somewhere between 5’7 and 5’10. It’s impossible to be feminine when you’re really tall. I hate being tall."
Kikpals,fdf59bi,t1_fdf4wjq,1578353613.0,Exactly!
Kikpals,fdf3mh2,t3_el0lam,1578352544.0,"I’d chat with you, but you’ll probably just ignore me since everyone I try to chat with or connect with in any way ignores me. I’m sure you’ll ignore this post too."
CougarsAndCubs,fdcygv8,t1_fdbwfod,1578288069.0,It would be for me
depression,fcxm1c8,t1_fcxhlkh,1578066179.0,21
depression,fcwwnj2,t1_fcwvhy9,1578040773.0,"I’m lonely as hell, I’ve never had a single friend in my life nor have I ever been in a relationship for starters."
depression,fcwva8m,t1_fcwk7ed,1578039078.0,Many reasons
depression,fcw1frs,t3_eizsdo,1578014933.0,"I exist only, and that probably won’t be for much longer."
depression,fcw1eeg,t3_cml6ni,1578014908.0,I’m ready to die now. I’m out of reasons and have nothing I want to continue to live for. Nothing is worth it. I’m done.
femboy,fcvzwzv,t1_fcvxzc4,1578013929.0,"I’m pretty far from ok. I can’t grow out my hair because my hair can’t do it. I have ugly hair, everytime I try to dress feminine I look stupid. I don’t look how I want."
femboy,fcvy5cu,t1_fcvxo8j,1578012765.0,I’ll keep trying I suppose
femboy,fcvxkvt,t1_fcvv6la,1578012391.0,I’ve tried. I look ridiculous.
love,fcvqnna,t3_eixlje,1578007914.0,Words are empty. I believe it when I see it
offmychest,fcv4naw,t1_fcv4jm9,1577994560.0,Miracles don’t happen to me. I’m an unlucky person.
offmychest,fcv43qi,t1_fcv3lod,1577994241.0,"I’ve stopped opening up too fast recently, it’s done nothing. I can’t make friends no matter what. I really don’t see how treating me like trash is love, nobody outside my family loves me, or even likes me. It’s like I’m naturally hated."
offmychest,fcufz1u,t1_fcu95tn,1577980039.0,Did I stutter?
offmychest,fcufvxm,t1_fcu0i4l,1577979978.0,"You’re only 17? I’m 21. I’ve never had any friends. I’ve had online friends but every one of them abandoned me, even now when I try making some, they abandon me pretty fast and don’t care about me at all. Like I said I matter to nobody, all these other people with online friends get to meet up, but whenever I try to see if I can meet up with any of my online friends they just say no, or that they want things to just be online. Like WTF!? Do people forget I have feelings too and want friends. All people do is treat me like shit, maybe I’ll start doxing them, and go to where they live and fuck the up for being so awful treating me like shit. I wish I had girls as friends, I’d much prefer having girls as friends then guys, but when everyone naturally hates you then there isn’t much you can do. It’s already hard to make friends because I’m shy, have social anxiety and have a disability which causes thoughts to come slow to me which means I can’t think of what to say. Before you ask, no it isn’t anything I’m doing to cause this, I promise. Honestly I get more and more convinced to kill myself every day. I can’t take being lonely and hated anymore. Add that on other issues I’m dealing with. Despite the lies people try to tell me, it doesn’t get better, it just doesn’t, for me at least. I’m gonna be dead before the end of the year, that’s a fact."
offmychest,fcu9051,t1_fctump3,1577975414.0,Nothing makes me happy anymore
offmychest,fcu8xjj,t1_fcu0j5s,1577975363.0,Idk. I just know I’d be happier as a girl.
offmychest,fctp894,t1_fctoiip,1577952528.0,"There is nothing positive, I literally have nothing going for me. Being a nice person has gotten me nothing. I can’t make friends, I have terrible SA, I’m very shy, I have a disability that makes it so thoughts and words come to me slowly, so I can’t think of stuff off the top of my head. I also don’t have a license yet, although that will likely change later this month. Also I’m 21."
offmychest,fctp452,t3_eivb4r,1577952372.0,I saw some people comment but it won’t show me the comments
offmychest,fctobj2,t3_eivb4r,1577951289.0,I’m aware that what I said is most likely not the case for all girls. I’m just saying in general this is how I feel.
gtaonline,fcl9dqc,t1_fcl9bjc,1577742653.0,I haven’t won it at all lol. I have to get my cars the hard way lol.

gtaonline,fcl6sdt,t1_fcl6qb0,1577741038.0,Wow so mature
CougarsAndCubs,fcaww55,t1_fcatoy6,1577578214.0,I’d never do such a thing
CougarsAndCubs,fca9clg,t3_egupfq,1577565087.0,Idk why but it won’t let me see the comments.
asktransgender,fc8z1xs,t3_egnsfh,1577544395.0,Hey I know exactly how you feel. I’ll be your friend if you want. I won’t leave you either. I promise
Kikpals,fc7k0cg,t3_egmals,1577509882.0,Let’s chat
AskReddit,fc5x9d6,t1_fc5wwny,1577467818.0,"Can’t call because I social skills and all that my mind goes blank when I talk. I’ve tried the online chat but it doesn’t work and it’s disgusting how they have it set up, I tried t many times but I never got to talk to anyone because it made me wait for hours and then it just disconnected me and made me start over. If someone comes in my life before then I won’t"
asktransgender,fc5x1bh,t3_egbegq,1577467685.0,"I don’t use my deadname at all. Here in Finland we don’t really use resumes much anymore, everyone uses LinkedIn to apply for jobs, it’s easier. So you aren’t required to put your deadname."
AskReddit,fc5wgyf,t1_fc5w31g,1577467359.0,"I literally don’t have a single person to talk to, I have family but they don’t understand me. Most people my age have already been in relationships, kissed a girl, held hands with a girl, ect. I always heard young love is the best and it looks like that’s something I’m not gonna get to experience since I’m unloveable. Also the older you get the more your expected to be able to provide for and support her and all that with a job and everything meanwhile I haven’t even been in a relationship yet. I’m sorry but suicide is something I’m willing to do and I lean more and more towards it everyday. Slowly becoming less and less afraid of death."
AskReddit,fc5vuco,t1_fc5viz8,1577466988.0,"Also keep in mind, women are a lot more picky of their partners than men are. Lesbians are also part of that percentage. You’re right, I have zero friends and never had a single friend in my life. I also don’t have a license so I can’t go out anywhere, I’ll finally have that next month though, I’m 21 mind you. Even then I don’t have the social skills to be able to socialise and talk. Honestly I’m already looking at suicide, because I just can’t take this anymore, I really don’t want to be alone forever and there’s other unrelated problems too."
asktransgender,fc5vjds,t3_eg7eym,1577466809.0,OMG I’m so sorry to hear that. It’s disgusting that people assault others because they’re different and it’s almost 2020. I’m here if you need support. I presented as Male until I was comfortable enough.
AskReddit,fc5v74u,t1_fc5uu50,1577466607.0,"Idk man. Honestly I believe that whole “there’s someone out there for everyone” bullshit is a huge lie. Maybe someone out there for a lot of people, but not everyone. So yes maybe there are people like who you described who can find love. But I can’t, and I’ve seen others on the same situation. I wouldn’t even consider myself ugly, I’m not overweight. I just think people need to stop lying and saying there’s someone for everyone when that’s not true."
ForeverAloneDating,fc5ur2b,t3_eg9kxt,1577466340.0,I’d love to chat. Honestly I probably only get like maybe 14 hours of sleep maximum a week.
Finland,fc5u8xx,t3_eg8t9f,1577466012.0,Beautiful!
AskReddit,fc5u24l,t1_fc5sgw2,1577465890.0,The fact that I have a disability that gives me social anxiety and makes me shy and have zero social skills makes it hard. I wish girls would approach me like they seem to do for other people but I guess I’m ugly and unloveable.
AskReddit,fc4mvbt,t1_fb9ol49,1577421411.0,Wish that would happen with me
depression,fc244tn,t1_fc243od,1577339653.0,Ok
MakeNewFriendsHere,fc23g85,t3_efq5lr,1577338861.0,Prove it. Talk is nothing.
depression,fc22tca,t3_cml6ni,1577338142.0,I need someone to talk to. I’m not feeling good
Tinder,fbxm71g,t1_fbw1u9b,1577193602.0,Thanks! I’ll finally have my license next month so I’ll be able to get out more. I have a disability which unfortunately causes me to be socially awkward and have no social skills. I’ll keep trying to work on my social skills though.
Tinder,fbvz7pw,t1_fbvyyn4,1577138230.0,I don’t have any friends. So not a lot of photo opportunities. 😕
Tinder,fbv1yxs,t3_ebvk4s,1577124079.0,"Really need help
