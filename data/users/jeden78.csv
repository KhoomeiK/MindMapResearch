MDEnts,ffwrfcw,t3_evigtw,1580309203.0,Yeah that flash sale on the carts was great but it was only for 45 mins... most of us have jobs and getting to a dispensary at 3pm is tough in the midst of a work day.
MDEnts,ffvapcd,t1_ffv6sck,1580259677.0,Yup agreed once it makes it to my local shop I'll pick up some but definitely not going out of my way when there are top shelf options I'm not waiting in line to pickup or paying a premium over already high prices.
MDEnts,ffv1bb6,t1_ffv12yp,1580253403.0,All of the live based concentrates taste identical to the flower (at least in my experience).
MDEnts,ffuynqm,t1_ffuy0i8,1580251860.0,Anything live I find to be true to the flower - when it comed to distillate however it's completely unnatural terpene counts as they are added in after the fact.

MDEnts,ffi4vo7,t3_et1sse,1579965144.0,I picked up some of this yesterday at Liberty 27%.  I definitely felt it - really heavy but a nice 50/50 hybrid.  Crazy bag appeal.  Curio has some great stuff out right now - recently got some Bubba Kush that was also really good.
MDEnts,ffi4nf7,t3_etgn0u,1579964958.0,WOW! 30% terps!  That looks awesome.
MDEnts,fffxkxm,t1_ffdr8jl,1579894004.0,"Agree with you on a lot of these - love their Bubba Kush and Purple Punch.  Blissful Wizard is also pretty ridiculous.

I got a really nice Blue Dream from them but Blue Cheese was super disappointing."
MDEnts,fffwuha,t1_ffctnha,1579893549.0,20% is crazy!  Definitely let us know if it lives up to expectations.
trees,fff1vr7,t3_eta7gv,1579873426.0,Back in the day it was Super Silver Haze- sometime around 2000ish.  Recently it's been some seriously fire Bubba Kush at 35% (insane and no I don't believe that inflated number but it still kicked my ass).
MDEnts,ffanl6z,t1_ffa2zb6,1579740158.0,Peake Releaf just started charging $55 for ForwardGro now that is serious wtf territory.
MDEnts,ff9bxbg,t1_ff910oo,1579709460.0,Shatter definitely is messy and sometimes a pain to deal with - but it does taste great when made right.
MDEnts,ff9bmsg,t1_ff9b22q,1579709266.0,Absolutely this.  Lemon OG Kush kicks my ass and its 20%.  I did just pick up some 35% Bubba Kush and it too kicks my ass - suuper heavy but I dont buy the numbers as accurate.  Terps really matter and thats the number I care more about if it's 2+% it will be amazing.

MDEnts,fezoc0g,t1_fezk897,1579459630.0,Iirc Cotton K was also pretty high in ocimene.
MDEnts,fezhrmt,t1_fewkcqs,1579457473.0,Everything I've had from them that has a high ocimene level has tasted amazing- my favorite being purple pineapple kush (which they need to bring back).  Ocimene is a terpene that causes that self realization of being high (that oh shit I am really high right now feeling).  Always on the lookout for more high ocimene strains.

CrohnsDisease,fe8ptd9,t3_enwebv,1578929079.0,"I'm 41 and have had Crohn's since I was 10.  It definitely sucks no bones about it.  There's no logic to this disease.  The best things you can do to have less of those I want to die days is:

1 Reduce your stress levels immediately.  Alot of what you are letting stress you out does not matter in the long run.  Have to learn to let go of things that are out of your control.

2  Learn what foods are your triggers and stay away from them.  The foods that can set it off are often surprising- like some people can't eat onions.  Others are often easy to figure out like drinking alcohol, eating greasy stuff, processed dairy foods and smoking cigarettes are all really inflammatory.  Controlling your inflammation is what it's all about.

Keep your head up, Crohn's is a bitch but all of us are among the toughest people on the planet- it's made us this way.  Your whole life is ahead of you still it might seem dark now but it's just a small tunnel and the light is not far off."
