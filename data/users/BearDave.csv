manga,ffwu797,t3_evnmm6,1580311098.0,"As another dude said it starts out decent, but as it goes on it just sorta turns progressively more shit.  I think its largely overhyped within particular communities because it basically for a good long while was THE Manhwa people pointed to going ""see Manhwa isn't a joke, see its a real thing!"" though over time better Manhwas came out, ToG itself continued to get worse.  

That said if I had to put a strong point to ToG is world building, it created a relatively unique world with its own motives, rules, and reasons and even while the story and characters in that world might be interested or bleh depending the world itself remains interesting.  
Honestly speaking you can probably do better with your time unless you just really enjoy the world."
manga,ffwbmz8,t3_evl0ug,1580294147.0,"Saihate no Paladin.  Technically an isekai but it puts the whole reincarnation stuff very far on the back burner.  The MC is raised by heroes who have become accursed undead but are still pious and good at heart.  MC becomes a wandering warrior/holyman who is out of touch with the current outside world since he was raised by long undead heroes from a bygone age.  
Eventually as the title describes he becomes a Paladin which is an actual title type thing within the church of this world.  
Unlike many isekai series and stuff this feels very much like a high fantasy series. Its something that could stand in the same realm of say a D&D novella and not just some bullshit isekai thing.  

Ryoumin 0-nin Start no Henkyou Ryoushusama.  NOT AN ISEKAI!  I figured I should get that out of the way real quick.  A strong man is conscripted into the military, hes a man of the people and very strong.  He stands up for justice, protects the weak, and is an all around awesome dude even if hes not the smartest guy.  After the war is over and he basically won the war as its outstanding hero the monarchy and aristocrat types give him some land in the middle of nowhere and basically use it to get him of the nation picture and more or less prevent him from effecting politics much.  Turns out ""his land"" is just some empty grasslands which already have some beastfolk types living on it, another aristocrat basically took all his supplies given to him by the kingdom, and so he has nothing except land that nobody wants or cares about and his own body/equipment. 
The story is about him building relations with the indigenous people, doing crazy feats of strength/combat, and generally staying as a good person with his own world views even if he is sorta dumb. 
Its relatively new, so it could easily develop into more but its looking solid.  

Maou no Ore ga Dorei Elf wo Yome ni Shitanda ga, Dou Medereba Ii?  NOT AN ISEKAI even though it has a title longer than my dick.  Dudebro becomes a high ranking magician/demon lord through hardwork and a quick wit.  He gets an odd elven slave girl and has a bit of an infatuation with her.  Its sorta of a romance/comedy but it has a real fantasy setting, has interesting twists on magic/magic circles (the MC is good at seeing, understanding, and manipulating said circles allowing him to manipulate other peoples magic).  This is a series that could go in a lot of directions and do amazingly and its really about what sorta story the author wants to tell.  

Mahou? Sonna Koto Yori Kinniku da!  Want stupid over the top action and characters?  Look no further.  MC is a strong muscle dude who basically lived in a demon forest type thing he can't use magic but hes dumb and strong and he believes his raw strength is ""muscle magic"".  He meets the other MC a small elven girl who is very good at magic, they end up traveling together, having adventures, and that sorta thing.  
This is probably the perfect sorta series for an 11yr old who just wants fun action, simple characters, and fantasy setting with no bullshit.  As someone who is many years over 11 I still enjoy it but just don't expect ""maturity"".  

In Another World, I'm Called: the Black Healer.  Its an isekai, soaked in isekai juice and so full of isekai mouth feel you'll explode if you are allergic to isekai.  That said it a decent enough series its about a girl getting isekai'd, getting magical powers and stuff and becoming a ""healer"".  This is a Shoujo series and it wears it proudly on its sleeve, lots of bishi knight/noble dudes, detailed hair, you name it it reeks of shoujo almost as much as it reeks of isekai.  
Though you know what?  Its decent enough.  MC can be a bit ""helpless damsel"" more often than I'd like but otherwise its a decent series for what it is.  If you want a female centric isekai with lots of cute guy... maybe this is for you."

Yeah it was probably more than needed even if he was armed, or potentially posed a threat (unless he was very well prepared).  Though at the same times odds are high hes going to get off of most of the charges so they'd probably rather go a bit overboard and hopefully make the dipshit think twice before repeating his crime since hes probably going to avoid most of the charges, especially since they didn't even catch him him in the act."

Kaifuku Jutsushi no Yarinaoshi.  Dudebro is isekai'd, hes a healer and he gets drugged, abused in a variety of ways, and basically treated as a slave but worse than almost any record of slavery to ever exist.

nottheonion,ffho5ls,t1_ffhm75d,1579944898.0,"The space force as it stands is largely being billed as responsible for satellites.  Both putting up new ones, keeping existing ones safe/operational, and retiring obsolete ones.  They would also likely besides protecting them have the means and training to destroy opposing ones aswell.  

As it stands in the event of actual full out war between any major powers (like say for instance China vs USA) there will be a fuck load of missiles flying into space, satellites will be priority targets and the technology to shoot them down with missiles from earth already exists, has been tested and proven in practice and can be launched by ships or from land.  
Imagine taking out the GPS network, imagine taking out military spy satellites, imagine crippling global communication especially military communication by taking out tons of satellites.  It would also be a pure profit asset wise in a war of a attrition satellites are expensive and putting them in orbit is even more expensive, but a missile to shoot them down? absolutely cheap as shit in comparison. 

Its not about making Battle Star Gallactica with space fighters, motherships, and all that sci-fi shit.

gaming,fffoidg,t1_fffcwaw,1579888369.0,"Build around spies and playing spies as much as possible.  This means as many spies as you have and possibly an decoy or two.  
After that just load up on strong cards and go to town.  This works for Nilfgard or Northern Realms as they are the two factions with realistic numbers of spies. 

Your entire goal with this sort of deck is to draw basically your entire deck and force the AI to concede early by making their board seem very powerful with spies so you can either sacrifice round1 if they flood the board (and get 2 easy wins after) or just put down barely enough to win, then get an easy win in round 2.  

So long as you have decent luck to draw 1-2 spies and some other cards to reuse spies or throw enemies spies back at them.  You will win basically every game with minimal opposition.  

This sort of deck basically kills any sense of balance or fun from Gwent (imo) because its very brain dead easy to pilot and is basically unbeatable by the AI who don't address spy board states at all intelligently.  

If you have problems getting to the point of getting a few spies to make it work a basic siege deck is your best option.  That usually involves a big upfront round1 (but not overkill), force the AI to burn round2 (and probably lose it), then get a basically free win round 3 with the AI very likely have no cards left and you just needing to have saved atleast one card.  
Its much less consistent because you don't have the draw power of spies, but its what you have to work with."

manga,fff5mgn,t3_et9qcn,1579876309.0,"I'm gonna list some series, but they are gonna be with some asterisks.  

Sundome.  This is a ""mature"" series, and it relies on you being atleast partially familiar ""trashy panty shot series"".  It sets itself up as a sort of fetish series and it has a fair amount of that panty shot fan service stuff.  Though its actually telling a dark, tragic story and its lulling the reader into a false sense of whats actually going on so that when it truly hits whats going on its going to take you by surprise.  
Its a tragic romance, hidden as a fetish series.  

Vagabond.  Its been on Hiatus for years and nothing sort of the author refinding himself and basically coming back to life as an artist (which he seems to have little interest in) its likely never coming back to be finished.  
I know you said finished series, but this is truly a manga that just highlights the actual art/drawing of manga so much.  Its a samurai series and it just captures that aesthetic in such an amazing way.   Your mental image of samurai will very likely be different after reading Vagabond both just from a stylistic/visual standpoint but also in how they think/do things in terms of personality.  

Real.  Same author as Vagabond... same ""hiatus forever"" as Vagabond.  This is the author that made Slam Dunk one of the most widely known and popular manga series ever about basketball.  Real instead tells a darker/more mature story about wheelchair basketball, about people with disabilities grappling with them and also the psychological impact of them.  Again its not finished, but it never will be, and having that be what stops you from reading something like this if you want true artistry and impact from a manga would be a true shame.  

Uzumaki by Junji Ito.  I'm not a huge fan of horror type stuff, its just not my thing.  Life is shitty enough I don't need a manga to make me scared.  That said Junji Ito is one of those dudes that just puts out absolutely astounding work even if its not really your cup of tea.  The characters look sorta bland/plain manga styled characters but then he combines that with detailed and unique body horror elements that are really trippy if not truly psychedelic.  

My Brother's Husband, by Gengoroh Tagame a rather famous Bara artist (muscular gay men hentai stuff).  Its the story of a single parent (male) meeting his dead brothers husband who he moved to Canada to marry.  It might not hold as much relevance today, but its also important in the context of manga because ""actual gay relationships"" outside of overly stylized BL and the like which is more for women than gay people is not really out there nor is it accepted well.  
Yeah its sorta cliche to talk about artisy gay acceptance stuff, but hey maybe its your cup of tea... maybe not.  Might aswell drop it in here anyhow.  It has more themes than the gay stuff especially about family estrangement/coming together and stuff but it really got a lot of critical praise for taking on homophobia in Japan VERY directly.  
The fact its done so tastefully by a guy who is known to do really kinky/pervy porn and not be a ""real author"" is also part of the impact of it for many.  

A Silent Voice.  You've probably seen it already, but the manga stands up well on its own if thats your cup of tea.  

Inuyashiki.  A very strange story that takes on a variety of themes about age, aging, and people coming to power who had none.  Yet its also combined with some absolutely excellent art.  Some of the robot/human hybrid stuff is truly mind blowing.  


A lot of people will say Oyasumi PunPun, hell even I'm saying it.  That said I have the controversial take that its really not that good and just felt like someone was playing corrupt a wish with their characters for most of the story.  Its dower and depressing and overly beats both the reader and characters down.  For many people I suspect its one of their first serious takes on such a downer topic/ideal but its honestly not handled that amazingly.  
I think the best way to describe my dislike is that PunPun the titular character is shown/represented as a very childish/cartoony bird-ish thing, its very abstract/childish.  Though the rest of the world is detailed and more lavish than many manga both backgrounds and characters who all look relatively ""normal human"" in comparison.  To me thats like going to see some art house movie about a ghost only to instead of having proper special effects to represent the ghost they instead have a guy with a sheet over his head and talk about how much more artistic and deep it is.  Sure some people probably do assign more significance to it, but for many I think they are parroting a narrative for a series that ultimately is not as remarkable as people like to present. 
I still listed it here, its the sorta series you'd mention for this sorta request even if you don't think it holds up aswell as others mentioned here.  It does have some solid art, it does have a more deep and complex story than your average manga, and while I don't think that makes it that great some people do.  


Just to add in a Manhwa because fuck it. The Breaker.  Its a martial arts series about a bullied/weak kid learning martial arts from a sorta strange substitute teacher only to find out about a ""martial arts underworld"" hidden beneath the normal world.  Its more detailed and flash than your average action manga and it has a pretty cohesive story.  It does have a sequel, and a third sequel is ""planned"" but the first series stands alone just fine and the sequel is complete aswell but its a big more trope-ish/main stream and not sticking to the original vibes as much.  


Oh yeah.  Shounen and Seinen are just 2 of 4 demographics.  The other two are Shoujo and Josei.  Shounen = aimed at younger boys... think action stuff you'd find on TV (One Piece, Naruto, etc). Seinen its aimed at teens and possibly even adults (males specifically), it will have more mature themes and often will also have better art with a longer release window a lot of what you are talking about wanting more of is going to be Seinen and most of the series you talked about and most of what I recommended are Seinen (with a few exceptions).  Shoujo is the girls counter part to Shounen, its aimed at younger girls.  Think Sailor Moon.  Josei is actually pretty damn rare and many Josei publications have moved away from comics over the years and might only have a handul of comics in them if any at all.  Its the female equivalent of Seinen.  Its going to mostly be more mature takes on romance series, think sort of like those trashy romance novels your grandma used to read with Fabio on the cover.  There are exceptions but I'd say thats the bulk of it.  
A lot of people will argue over if something is Shounen or Seinen... you just go by what its published in.  If its published in a Shoujo magazine then its Shoujo, if its published in a Seinen magazine then its Seinen, and so on.  
TL;DR here, basically you are asking for Seinen stuff thats all you need to know I guess."
projectgorgon,ffesne4,t1_ffeddt5,1579863619.0,"Honestly just about anything can work, its just about using what you like and knowing the issues with a particular weapon/skill type.  

Sword works, its a default skill and has no extreme costs associated with it.  AH has some pets with slashing debuffs that sorta match up well enough.

Knife Fighting is generally sorta ""eh"" but if you are pairing it with AH you can get a pet with a poison debuff to pair with the poison skills from Knife Fighting and make it work.  

Bard is actually a decent all around skill line.  With the proper gear mods for Song of Discord its a very potent AoE damage spec.  You will have to grind various performance/art type things to unlock it, and level break at higher levels but it is more than worth it imo.  

Archery works too, there is a poison arrow to compare to knife fighting but its going to be expensive to level as you gotta pay for arrows and grind fletching to make them.  Though you sorta end up your prototypical ranger with a bow and a pet.  

AH can basically work with anything, just find a main damage skill line you like and run with it. 
Even if say Bard is the best option, maybe you don't like bard, maybe you don't like having to stand still and play a song.  For the benefits of sword/ah with slash, you can get similar benefits poison, and I think you can do similar with crushing too with a bear (I'd have to double check bear pet abilities).  
AH is flexible, find what you want to do, then figure out how to make AH work with it and you'll probably find SOMETHING unless you are dead set on using magic where AH has marginal/minimal synergy."
Mordhau,fferwel,t1_ffcwg32,1579862543.0,"Archery/ranged weapons that arn't siege weapons are absolute jokes.  At best they are annoying pests that shoot you in the ass while you are distracted and hit you for thing like 1/5 to 1/2 your health depending on armor and hit location. 

A person can side step, either direction, INSTANTLY and they can do so faster than an arrow flies.  

You can parry an arrow, and it can happen often enough even just by accident due to how large the parry window is.  I've had this situation happen to me multiple times when playing with a ranged weapon.  I am taking aim at a person in the melee, they block a swing I go for a shot knowing they are going to likely be stepping back by the time my arrow gets their their parry window is still technically active and deflects the arrow.  If its a very long range shot this isn't as much of an issue but if you are shooting into melee at a serious range odds are high you'll do just as much if not more friendly fire than actual damage.  

You can crouch basically instantly.  Unless  you are getting shot in the shin its going to avoid basically everything just like crouching does vs left clicks even if people try to drag the down.  

Again you can literally see an arrow get shot at you and side step it, crouch it, or parry it.

Finally random ass weapon swings can clash the arrow and bat it out of the sky.  So even perfect flawless arrow shots at a person can and will get deflected by an allied or enemy weapon swing.  
Not a chamber but a clash (when both weapons hit and shoot out sparks), this is almost never intentional but you can play baseball with arrows basically if you gave enough of a fuck. 

Archery is in such a shit state they might aswell remove it from the game and nothing of value would be lost outside of cosplay stuff.  Even if archery wasn't absolutely shit, shields still basically enable a direct hard counter to it since shields have a hitbox larger than its visuals for blocking arrows and you can just hold up a kite shield and press W and there is nothing an archer can do about it so long as you keep the shield pointed in its general direction.  

I'm not even suggesting to buff archery, most people hate it, the people who use it are just masochists who seemingly enjoy being useless.  I consider myself a decent archer and I still get more kills from dipshits running at me and just shanking them with my dagger.  For archery to be decent as it stands you'd need to be telepathic and have near flawless FPS aim... sadly my telepathy is useless and my aim is only good.  You could let archers have an actual aimbot and they'd still probably miss more than they hit."
YouShouldKnow,ffer1by,t1_ffe7ifo,1579861253.0,"I would say your argument is inherently flawed and realistically any sort of discussion with you would be flawed/pointless.  You are equating a political party to what is effectively a domestic terrorist group.

Do you think every man that supports feminism is a closet misandrist, or thinks negatively about who/what they are.... that they see themselves as some sort of evil twisted oppressor?  
I'd go out on the limb here and say many of them probably don't, but they see the benefits of getting women in the work place, of general encouragement of women into more varied career fields, and are generally pretty egalitarian and while many feminists especially those with more extreme views might not represent them truly especially the TERF sorts perhaps but ultimately they will still call themselves feminists, and still support the things they find important from the movement even if its not everything.  

The problem too many people have is that they associate ""republican party"" with racist, homophobic, mega-bigots.  As though that is in anyway an actual political platform and not just the mud that gets slinged at them especially certain segments of that political party.  

If you can understand a man being a feminist (a good thing), but can't understand a gay man being a republican/conservative/right wing aligned that says more about you than it does about them.... atleast to me anyhow.  
It says you are probably too politically involved in your own views, and the rhetoric against your opposition to truly understand or every try to understand them.

I think the big problem Naruto ran into was absurd anime success.  I think eventually Kishimoto reached a point where outside sources/influences (editors, anime/movie producers, etc) effectively took him from writing a manga, to writing a template to make animes and movies off of.  They wanted to shift Naruto into a DBZ replacement, and we see Naruto shift greatly from story and characters to just focusing about a basic rivalry/friendship between Naruto/Sasuke and instead having all sorta of massive epic fights between legions of different characters."

One Piece would be THE series to talk about and upvote if this was based on the average manga reading audience regardless of Japan or western audiences.

Outside of stuff like that you'd have Mairimashita! Iruma-kun, The Promised Neverland, World's End Harem, and stuff like that.  These are the very high selling relatively mainstream series pushing out volumes right now.  
Mairimashita! Iruma-kun has a current anime and that current anime thing is really important for the big current trending manga series.  In no small part the point of anime in Japan is to sell volumes of the manga, light novel, whatever.  

Series like Kingdom are often right up there alongside things like One Piece, or current ""big series"" like Kimetsu no Yaiba.

Shit that gives you memes, can have an ""ethical"" scan link or atleast pretty close to it, and things that have bigger appeal across gender lines (so romance/love comedy stuff tends to do better than normal).  Also having often/consistent releases available is important.  Series like Peerless Dad is a good series, but it got a lot more traction in this subreddit because the scans had tons of raws to catch up to and for a while we had 1-2 chapters a day if not more and this happens for various series that gets a lot of traction in the subreddit.

It can be unconfortable at times but more from pinching and such than the fabric being rough or uncomfortable.  

Secondly it keeps things nice and contained.  Precum dripping down?  No worries you got the sock.

Jokes aside, I don't know any actual manga reviewers.  Usually those sorts of people will be involved in both manga, anime, and other things too and its more just ""general weeb shit reviews"" and even most of those are not something I'd generally recommend to people.  

Honestly I'd just ask for recommendations, and read other peoples recommendation requests and see what gets suggested.  Its a bit like book reviews just not being much of a thing compared to say film reviews.

BeAmazed,ff7uh58,t1_ff7n6cv,1579658653.0,"Because they don't want their records tarnished with ""lul sumo"".  Beyond this many WR lifts have very strict rule sets for grips, belts, suits, straps, and raw.  

Heres a great example of sumo in practice from a serious competitive lifter.  

Yuri Belkin is one of ""the sumo guys"" who actually uses sumo and tries to use it in competition.  His max known with sumo in competition is 970lbs, but with traditional his max is known as 771lbs.  Hes pulling nearly 200lbs more with sumo vs traditional, and he could probably improve those traditional numbers some with his current strength and ability, but almost assuredly it will never touch his sumo numbers no matter how hard he tries or works towards it.  

Another problem you run into is that sumos benefits vary GREATLY based off of a persons height/build.  Arm length, leg length, and similar will impact the ""benefits"" of the sumo life meaning most traditionally ""huge guys"" see marginal if any benefit from sumo just because of how large they are.  Where as if there was a power lifting ""little person"" they would get absolutely insane benefits from the sumo lift to the point it might not even be a lift anymore lol.  

As it stands sumo is a rules technicality that exists, that people want to get rid of.  Though enough people go ""why do you care just lift your lift"" to actually do anything about, but its only for power lifting.  
In many years prior basically everyone into powerlifting was a very comparable physical size.  Though with a rising female powerlifting scene, more smaller guys getting into power lifting, and so on the benefits of sumo are increasing.  As people who can win a lift with sumo, but would lose the lift if forced to lift traditional happen more and more there will be ever increasing opposition to the sumo lift rules ""oversight"".  

All of that said outside of competition and such, sumo to your hearts content.  Especially if you have back issues, and are the proper proportions to receive a serious benefit from a sumo lift.  Train however you find most comfortable and if people give you shit for it tell them to fuck themselves regardless of who/what you are.  
I'm in the camp that when it comes time for a competition you need a singular unified lifting form that everyone uses and is held to.  If thats traditional, sumo, or something else entirely I don't particularly care but I think competitive rules should strive to prevent a person winning or losing based on them using a particular form and just have a single unified form and/or branch off the deadlift into two things with sumo and traditional as their own things."

Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest.  Probably THE revenge series.  Dungeon Seeker above is considered to be plagarized from Arifureta.  A lot of your modern revenge shit is heavy inspired and influenced by Arifureta (not the manga as much as the novels).
Honestly I think Dungeon Seeker did it arguably better, where as Arifureta just sorta goes all over the place and drifts Dungeon Seeker feels more focused.  

The Rising of the Shield Hero.  Had a sorta popular anime a while back, that was really popular for the main female character.  It has more story going on than the revenge stuff, but at its base its still guy gets bullied, tricked, abused, and seeks revenge while secretly being the bestest ever."
trashy,ff5k1y5,t1_ff5g0wv,1579596588.0,"> Then there was that other story where it leaked that a popular singer/voice actress slept with every member of her band (except the bassist, hilariously), and as a result she was let go by her agency and for a while could barely get any jobs in her field.

That would be Aya Hirano, and honestly she was a turbo bitch.  

She tried to force her way up the corporate ladder with sex, she tried to fuck every member of her band so that she could have blackmail material on them and force them to do as she wanted.  The bassist refused to have sex with her (he was married happily) and brought the issues forward as sexual harassment, when she tried to get the bassist kicked out of the band.  Many other members of the band came forward and supported the bassist and admitted to having sex with her/that she came onto them.  

All the while Aya Hirano was also shitting on the fans at large even before the sex scandal.  She was basically only popular for being a VA for bit nerdbait type characters.  Then when nerds would approach her at meet and greets shed just insult them and call them losers, and she'd do the same shit online and in interviews.  She saw her VA work as just another stepping stone on her rise to stardom.  

The sex scandal ruined her career and basically everyone just didn't want to work with her anymore.  Though she did manage to avoid a criminal trial for blackmail and sexual harassment when the bassist agreed to not press charges after the company agreed to drop her and keep the band together.  

The Aya Hirano story is not some sad fucked up story of an idol being mistreated, its a woman trying to lie, fuck, and cheat her way as far as possible and basically just going insane.  Only to get exposed when she tried to ruin another persons career when they wouldn't get manipulated by her/have sex with her.  

It was a really big scandal in the anime community when it all happened.  She was at the time basically the biggest female VA in the anime industry.

Edit, for everyone asking for sources it was mostly 2chan leaks from nearly 10 years ago.  You wouln't find credible publications covering such things because the dealings between the band, label/management, and Aya all happened behind closed doors and at best you can look at what happened to the various people involved take at as ""hey maybe thats why it turned out like that"".  Nearly everyone involved wanted it to be out of public view as fast as possible for all of their benefits....  You wouln't find any information on the scandal on her wikipedia, you wouln't find major outlets covering it, you wouln't find shit about it outside of rumors and leaks from industry insiders (if you believe them).
If you don't want to believe it, do so.  If you want to think I'm just a master in creative writing feel free.  Regardless I'm not going to try to dig up 2chan leaks from a decade ago for you especially since they would be in Japanese and you'd have to take my word on the translation anyhow."

Jutsi wa Watashi wa and Hentai Ouji are both easy ""read the manga, loser!"" kinda series.

TECHNICALLY shounen but its generally well received by most people.  Its focused on the two MC's relationship, there is very minimal ""will they wouln't they"" for hundreds of chapters, they get together, they hold hands, they go beyond that and it feels a lot more natural and not like complete bullshit. 
Later on as the MC's relationship is sorta ""explored"" the story continues but instead looks at their friends relationships, or struggling to find relationships.  So its technically on going, but its also sorta ""completed"" in that the main couple has gotten together, done things, and its very clear they will remain together at the very least for the rest of their school life most likely.  

Molester Man!  No don't walk away, there is no molestation here... I swear.  Guy is mistaken for a molester by a girl who sorta kinda has a stalker, thats cleared up pretty fast and the guy was like ""hey shes cute"" so he starts trying to get to know her and so on.

No stuck in an MMO bullshit, no fantasy cyberdrama bullshit.  Just a really good video gameplayer doing amazing things in a VRMMO by putting in the time grinding, understanding game systems, and so on.  

The Gamer.  Its on Webtoons.com for official english translations straight from the publisher.  Guy gets RPG powers in real life (think like Solo Leveling) but dramatically less edgy and a lot more fun/goofy.  

Ernak.  Another Manhwa, dude bro gets ""stuck in a game"" but its one hes familiar with and it almost works out like hes a time travel from the future with all his game knowledge.  Hes personally sorta unremarkable outside of his knowledge but hes able to recruit NPC's and such that he knows their history/backstory to his cause and helps them not fall to evil.  

Sword Empire.  Manhua (aka chinese) about guys basically playing a VRMMO version of Total War.  No getting stuck in the game, but there is crazy shit with family power struggles and shit normal to chinese series and fights for family power happening in the game world instead.  

Moto Sekai Ichi'i Subchara Ikusei Nikki: Hai Player, Isekai wo Kouryakuchuu!  Yep a title longer than my dick, it has to be a weirdo LN adaptation.  Very similar to Ernak dude is brought into an MMO and uses his knowledge to further his own ends.  This involves getting NPC's who are classed as a knight to use their skills to instead be an archer, a mage to instead by a priest, and stuff like that where they failed at their class but they had a great statline to be something else.  


Toaru Ossan no VRMMO Katsudouki.  The MMO aspects arn't very realistic/believable but it basically follows a guy through a VRMMO and he just has a different approach to things, people, NPC's, etc.  He effectively ends up becoming loved by various AI's/NPC's within the game for how different he is compared to a normal person.  


The New Gate.  Guy gets SAO'd, and hes sorta kinda Kirito leading the people to clear the dungeon and escape.  They are successful and clear the dungeon, he believes he escapes only to realize hes now in the same game world but hundreds of years in the future.  Instead of trying to clear a dungeon or anything, hes now just living in the world, and the former players from back then are held as legendary heroes and near godlike beings by the NPC world.

Dude gets mistaken for a molester by pretty girl, he tries to ask her out, and basically it follows the journey and ends up in a different place than you'd expect.  ""based off a true story"" from 2chan (Japanese 4chan).  

Do Chokkyuu Kareshi x Kanojo.  Short, complete, over the top.  I'd come close to calling it ""The One Punch Man of romance"".  Both male and female MC's are overtly straight forward and burst out overtly.  Sorta like Horimiya in the whole ""no pussy footing around"" stuff but in a much more comical way.  

Saotome Senshu, Hitakakusu.  Girl is great at boxing, sort of the pride of the school/region kinda great.  Boy is obsessed with boxing but basically a weak piece of trash, he also happens to like said awesome girl.  
The story is more about them trying to hide their relationship because the girl is treated like an idol (shes not supposed to date anyone) and both of them being awkward in their own ways.  
It was pretty popular on this subreddit and only completed recently, there is some boxing involved/sports kinda stuff.  

NEET dakedo Hello Work ni Ittara Isekai ni Tsuretekareta.  Sorta trashy isekai series.  But while it has the MC doing magic and adventure stuff it also has a strong romance aspect which actually sees progression, seemingly even goes the harem route while seeing said progression.  
Not a great series, but if you want actual with ""actual romance"" this might be your best bet?  For the most part series tend to do one thing better than another even if it has comedic or romance elements most series are action first or visa versa with a series being romance first with minor comedy/action involved."

So you know shes going to make it through the hardships, you know she will become the knight of the king, and that together the two of them will be successful.

manga,fexkmq7,t1_fexes63,1579432517.0,"Well guess what dipshit?  I worked for a great many years in SEO and internet marketing...  Aka I have a REALLY good fucking idea what a website like JB is capable of generating based off their estimated traffic numbers and estimated ad rates based on the advertisers they use.  

I was the dipshit that pulled up the data and circulated the 50k per month figure, and I don't touch any manga associated discords because they all just feel like useless cliques.  

https://www.worthofweb.com/website-value/https:/jaiminisbox.com/

There are various websites out there that do estimated values of websites, and estimated daily, monthly, and yearly income figures.  Based on the known advertisements they have.  

Now worth of web, and similar sites DO NOT have direct financial information, and more often than not they over estimate values and ad revenue returns due to not being able to properly adjust for the rates of people using adblockers and the actual figures they are working off of being external estimates.  

So while web of worth says 70k, its actually more like 50k a month most likely.  Its also trending down as it was just under 80k a few weeks ago, and their traffic and value estimates will continue to trend down without finding a real replacement to breaking street dates for WSJ series.  


Where as for MangaDex we don't know how much they get in donations, but generally donation drives almost always fail outside of a big backer just showing up and throwing a huge sum of money towards it.  Like say when Amazon donates 1mil to Wikipedia (even if it wasn't cash but an endowment fund).  
Yet we do know that as of right now and the past 2 years MangaDex has NOT used ads, like at all.  Not a single one, this means the largest realistic income source for a web business like this simply isn't being used.  They can do whatever they want with their donation fund and outside of Bill Gates showing up and tossing a few million dollars at them without anyone knowing nothing of real value will happen with it.  
This means the only realistic means of income left worth noting besides the donations is their 3 affiliate links which probably mean next to nothing income wise at best they just reduce cost of operation a handful of affiliate links are not going to bring in the big bucks.  Well I guess also their mouse pad sales?  Most people don't even know they sell them and its sorta off the beaten path, you have to seek it out that means its probably a very minor income source in a best case scenario.  

Cost of operation wise MangaDex costs about 500-600 per month to maintain, as a basic estimate based off their disclosed sources.  Including their confirmed donates resources such as donated server space from a few people.  For ANYONE at MangaDex to truly be turning a profit they would need over $500 worth of donations and mouse pad sales per month.  Thats possible, but at that point you are nearly pushing into the realm of a full time Twitch Streamer.  Which they would not over spend because there are no incentives to donate multiple times to MangaDex so it would likely just sit in the donation account and/or be zero'd out.  
Ask basically any scanlation group, or anyone that operates off donations... they are basically never enough to get by and are almost always a supplement to actual funding.  

Could someone at MangaDex theoretically have soul access to the donation account or bitcoin wallet.  Speaking of bitcoin wallet... THAT IS PUBLIC.  

https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1LoBrk5gRR5Mhy9LhjDZQ8BeM9Xby6LP3H

That is MangaDex's bitcoin wallet, you that site can swap between BTC and USD so you can click to a dollar value.  The primary figures to look at are ""transactions"", ""received"", ""sent"", and ""current"" up there next to the QR code.  Since nobody probably wants to deep dive a BTC wallet the current balance of the wallet is worth about 20-30 USD, they've gotten a total of 10 ""transactions"" (read slightly less than that in donations), and its nowhere near totaling anything anyone would truly give a fuck about.  

While I can't prove the lack of donations to their paypal account, based off my experience with donation campaigns and general knowledge of donation campaigns in terms of supporting a business I can almost certainly assure you it will come out to a net loss (annually, aka per year) with the known cost of operations (assuming EVERYONE is non-paid) they probably spike up above their monthly costs from time to time based on the month, but over a whole year?  Those lean donation months probably drag down any potential surplus cash they'd have.  

The entire reason they are even talking about or considering ads after 2 years of ad free operation is because its probably been costing them money to stay functional or come very close to it and they are finding it hard to justify the continued expense.  


At this point I've covered enough nuance and hopefully shown I'm not just some random dipshit parroting shit from other reddit posters, a discord, whatever.  I'll also take this time to say I am not affiliated in any form with MangaDex besides as a registered user.  Nor am I affiliated with any scanlation groups, again outside of being a user/consumer.  

With that out of the way the TL;DR here is that I can PROVE to you that JB is making many thousands of dollars a month, every month, without considering any revenue source besides ads.  Where as with MangaDex while I can prove a lot less, you are basically going to have to assume they are getting absolutely massive donations, nobody is talking it about, and someone is just pocketing it instead of using it to support the site."

manga,fexaup1,t3_equcxf,1579427866.0,"Thats going to be hard, because there are no consistent covers.  

For the original run, most manga are in magazines so you just have the magazine cover really.  ComicVine covers most comic type publications covers, this includes manga magazines.  

Then you have tankobons, these are collections of a few chapters published as a book.  This is where you could find actual covers...  MAYBE.  Why maybe?  A few series don't actually have cover art variety its just a single cover for their tankobon, others instead have very detailed ones with a consistent design across multiple volumes.  
Then you have the problem of reprints/runs, for instance different print runs of a series will have different covers.  A few harem manga have been known to sell different tankobons with different girls on the cover you can buy the entire tankobon set with your waifu or whatever.  

Then you have Omnibus releases, these are basically multiple tankobons combined into one and these will also have their own cover art and usually are highly detailed and over the top.  Many series will only have like 1-4 Omnibus compared to say 20+ tankobons without breaking a sweat (probably many more).   This means a lot of the ""good"" cover art that really stands out and has impact and isn't just a character on a background is going to come from Omnibus, they will almost always have coherent design across the entire Omnibus run aswell giving them more details and such including along the spines.  


I'm assuming you are wanting the tankobon covers.  You can probably find popular series tankobon covers and variant covers too.  Things like One Piece, Naruto, etc probably have multiple full collections of covers and special covers and such out there.  But if you are looking for something more random/not super main stream?  You are gonna be shit out of luck more often than not."

manga,fewwu37,t3_eqt8ef,1579420720.0,"Thats half true, but something important to remember with Chinese series is that its like reading Japanese series 20-30 years ago.  Only a very select few series make it through and the big things you'll know would be like mecha series or magical girl series.  

I'd also argue that Chinese series TRADITIONALLY are more of the light novel variety as compared to say Japan which has a lot more manga.  Due to that most ""manhua"" are sorta looked down on culturally within China, they are for losers and has a very narrow focus.  Its sorta like say American Comics being overtly super hero focused, but having a rather rich literary history with novels/novella. 


That said there are a fair amount of different Chinese Manhua out there besides cultivator stuff.  Notably they have surprisingly good BL/GL series.  

Tamen de Gushi is probably one of the better known yuri/GL series out there, and its Chinese and has nothing to do with cultivation, martial arts, etc.  

Guang Xiang/Here U Are.  This sorta kinda is THE current BL/yaoi series in China, and it actually has some international following. 

I'm not particularly big on BL/GL stuff but its certainly something Chinese series are known for besides cultivation stuff.  A fair amount of the cultivation series will also flirt with BL/GL stuff, much more so than Korean or Japanese series and not just ""I drew a girl and called it a boy"" sorta trap stuff that will be a route the story never takes anyhow.  


I also think its important to remember its China, this is a much bigger deal than you might think.  Your stories need to be ""non-subversive"", can you theoretically have a story about overthrowing a government/having a rebellion but it needs to be against the right sort of antagonists.  A good example of this is Iron Ladies, the MC is using the power of a dictatorship to overthrow corrupt royals, capitalist pigdogs, and ""intellectuals"" its like basically enemies taken straight out of Maos red book.  Actually pay attention to the enemies within these chinese series almost always they could be ""Mao approved"" enemies.  
This is also where China gets a lot more freedom with romance stories, particularly in terms of BL/GL stories.  Mao and classic Chinese government subversive stuff just tend to not give a flying fuck about sex, sexuality, or romance they care about power and control.  So you can make very full featured romance stories with gay characters with ease and put a lot of effort and creativity into it.  
Where as something like a cultivator series?  Its safe explored territory that is officially recognized as a ""suitable topic for comics"".  


I guess I rambled a bit, but there is a lot more going on here than just unoriginal writers or whatever."
manga,fewq8y4,t3_eqsuat,1579417864.0,"MangaDex is a generally very good and decent source for Manga.  They don't have everything and scanlators can just not upload their stuff there.  That said most of the scanlators that don't upload there are just money hungry scumfucks who are probably better off ignored.  

MangaPlus, this is the WSJ official online stuff.  They have free releases that is faster than anything outside of illegal scanlations (aka from illegal raws, not that any scanlation is particularly legal), its going to meet or beat the street publication dates.  Want to read One Piece or whatever?  Thats where you go.  

Like MangaPlus there are a variety of other first party providers actually putting out decently quick and accessible free translations of their content.  Potentially with a delay or other limits, but they are out there and honestly its worth going to the actual source if its available just to support the series.  
For instance The Gamer is on Webtoons, and they do decent enough translations (most of the time) and its basically all available for free with some delays on the latest chapters for free readers.  You'll find a fair amount of online comics have similar publications available in english and honestly they shouldn't be overlooked but its diverse enough you can't just list them all out.  

Outside of that you have a legion of ""less than nice"" MangaNoun sites.  MangaFox, MangaPanda, KissManga... aka ""MangaNoun"" websites.  You arn't going to find links to them here, and I wouldn't go to those types of sites without an ad blocker, you probably want a ""stop script"" setup for your browser aswell incase they are bitcoin mining like the whores they are.  That said while they are whores and you need to protect yourself from them they also tend to have ""everything"", MangaDex only has half a series?  no worries a MangaNoun site probably has that missing half.  Asshole scanlators like JB still bogarting a cool series and nobody is willing to snipe them?  MangaNoun's can keep their traffic down."

Horimiya is ""is finished"" in the sense that the two MC's have gotten together and are in a successful relationship that has gone beyond hand holding.  Yet the mangaka was like ""yeah I don't want to stop even though the stories kinda done"" and so he just kept continuing the series but with a focus more towards the MC's friends/classmates through the view of the MC's.  


Molester Man.  Don't be scared the title the MC is not a molester, there is basically no molestation or other ""misconduct"" within the entire series.  Guy gets mistaken by cute girl as a molester, its quickly cleared up and guy goes after a relationship with said cute girl.  Its relatively short, complete, and had a great ending."
manga,fevbahx,t3_eqos9j,1579395320.0,"Horimiya.  Romance oriented manga, light on the humor compared to some but it more than makes up for that by having actual plot development and not having a ""will they wouln't they"" for 200 chapters.  

Yancha Gal no Anjou-san.  Liked Natatoro?  Expect something very similar here.  

Tomo-chan wa Onna no ko!  This subreddit ws basically a Tomo-chan subreddit until the series ended.  Its only a 4koma but you have just under 1k chapters.  

5Toubun no Hanayome.  The biggest current harem manga?  If you were about the Nisekoi life 5toubun basically represents the ""current version"" of that style of manga.  Its different, its about a guy with quintuplet sisters, but its a similar idea."
manga,feurcns,t3_eqnsvl,1579389229.0,"Check out chinese series for ones you like. Usually they have 1-2 dudes who are passionate about the series working on translating it, usually hundreds of chapters behind available raws and just pumping out a chapter every few days to a week, some of them will get multiple chapters in a day every week or so.  

Not super ""consistent"" but if you want to open up MangaDex, go to your follows, and see a few new chapters every day find a few series like this you like and go for it. 

THAT SAID most of these series are ""sub par"" with questionable writing, stupid OP characters that would be ridiculed even in fanfiction communities and often overlap heavily on the ideals of cultivator series.  That said but if you just want a few chapters or two to read every night when you lay down its hard to find something truly good that will fill that niche.  

Some examples.  

The Ghost Doctor.  Technically an Isekai, but that aspect is ignored very quickly. Princess girl is mistreated and left for dead by rival, modern badass girl reincarnates into her as she dies and the two characters are ""merged"" into a single person of pwnitude.  She then walks around being an unbeatable OP cultivator type who defeats all her enemies and is loved by all others.  Following the plot is hard, but if you just want a comic with a chick just being OP and independent it will do alright I guess.  

Rebirth Of The Urban Immortal Cultivator.  An immortal cultivator lives for countless years, but is reborn with all his cultivator knowledge as himself when he was a teenager in ""modern earth"".  He then supports his family, wants to make sure friends and family he knew are given better fates, stuff like that.  It mostly boils down to him being OP as fuck, and doing as he pleases to amass as much power and standing as possible and have people just go ""oh MC is so amazing"" with a plot that can be hard to follow.  



If instead you just want a good weekly series you have a LOT of options as most big popular series are weekly or monthly releases (most of them weekly) and they will get updated either same day as release or within a few days depending on the group.  
Some examples would be something like say Kingdom, its relatively big/popular and gets regular-ish weekly updates and has a sizable backlog to read up on if you arn't current with.  Though it could literally be nearly any major series."
gifs,feun9pv,t1_fetc3ir,1579388171.0,"Nah.  

Overall actual styles have probably increased, but those styles are more similar than they used to be.  Even when everyone and their mother wore the same style of dress everyone went out of their way to find different/unique patterns of fabric, do embroidery, something to give it individuality and flair.  

The average dude might just wear tshirt + shorts/pants, but there is so much variety that even if its ultimately the same basic fashion its visually different enough to see a sea of diversity from the exact same fashion style.  

The problem with more modernized fashion is that while people have a big more diversity in fashion, different styles and cuts of pants, shorts, dresses, jackets, etc.  They are often less diverse in terms of colors, patterns, material, etc.   
This very post is a great example of it, they all have black leggings, they all have a similar faded denim jacket.  If this was ""the standard fashion"" from 50 years ago everyone would have different leggings, more materials/colors for the jacket, etc but now instead things are more standardized to ""a fashion"" and while there are more fashion those fashions are more standardized so that people can clearly see and go ""oh you are in that fashion"". 

I often feel more modern fashions are more akin to uniforms.  You are trying to convey an idea of ""I'm in X social group"" and that might be ""basic white girl"" or ""fashion focused dude with overly tight pants""... FUCK the very point that I wanted to add ""with overly tight pants"" sorta speaks for itself its a defining feature of a social group basically."
manga,feqjsgf,t3_eqel6v,1579342648.0,I actually just caught up with this series.  I'm really interested in what she'll create for herself as something she considers her own.
manga,feqjazm,t3_eqe473,1579342554.0,"GTO, aka Great Teacher Onizuka.  Its heavy on the mid-late 90's nostalgia.  It goes out of its way to have a lot of tie ins to ""modern"" things like for instance having the characters use a PS1 and fashion was being on point.  

Slam Dunk.  THE sports manga, a great sports manga that happened to take place around the same time as the Chicago Bulls with Michael Jordan was dominating the NBA.  There is probably no more iconic sports manga in history that isn't about a fighting sport (like Ippo or something).  

Maison Ikkoku.  Its not the first romcom series, but it might aswell be for how it influenced everything to come after it.  Lots of peek 80's Japan and is a huge influence to the genre.  

Touch, Baseball manga with a bit of coming of age/romance to add in.  Very early 80's styled and a large cultural touch stone for the time period.  Over a hundred anime episodes, 26 manga volumes...  Touch is to mainstream stuff like say Friends or Seinfield, it was everywhere and even if you didn't watch it you knew about just from cultural osmosis.  

Your Under Arrest, the manga itself isn't that remarkable but as a series its another cultural hallmark.  It has live action TV series, more animes that I can count both in series, OVA and movies, and it has a long running manga.  


I avoided anything that wasn't set in ""current day Japan"" incase you were actually wanting that as a setting.  If you want something that just feels 80's as fuck maybe Appleseed?  Its a mecha/police sorta thing that was common for the time and has a nice movie/ova to go with it."

If it relies on millions of people standing up and doing so, then Bernies election is utterly pointless and he could just be a figure head like MLK leading rallies and protests.  
Though the reality is you can tell where his priorities are.  

Also how are millions of people ""rising up"" going to change non-elected officials?  When you are talking about people who are outside of the election cycle completely but influence elections through their positions on boards, as chairmen, etc and are basically the people behind the purse strings...  How does ANYONE rising up change a single damn thing?  

Worse of all, even if this can be done effectively somehow.  How will be be done fairly (aka fucking the RNC AND DNC not just either or)?  How do you get people that won with the current election system and directly benefit from it to vote to change the election process?  It doesn't matter how many people stand up, unless that standing up involves fire bombing the capitol building it basically means dick to those sorts of people.  

I'm not trying to just be a negative douchebag, but there are things that can be accomplished by a politician and there are things that can't.  Even in the world of things that technically can happen, many never will happen.  You can't just go ""oh this politician said they want to do X"" to mean ANYTHING AT ALL unless its actually within the realistic power and influence of the political office they are running for to do."

Remember all the talks about rooting out corruption and shit from Trump?  Yeah it went nowhere, and you know whats going to go nowhere with Bernie either.  

Assuming he wins the election he is a bit under 4 years to try to pressure the house and senate to actually make real changes, of which almost none will actually get through unless they are main stream enough to not torpedo those peoples careers.  The actual corrupt top line officials are NOT in the elected position, they are people behind ""foundations"" who control the flow of money and voter funds, they are the people that take donations from ""outside sources"" (read foreign governments and large companies) and funnels that into usable funds for the party and from that a politician can benefit.  
There is NOTHING a president can do to change that, the president does not have power or authority to overtly change those positions nor do they have a power to make laws that change that.  At best they can try to lobby the house and senate to pass laws that might effect those people and how the money flows.  

No matter how unique, different, or valiant you think a presidential candidate might be... you need to keep your views grounded.  You need to realize what a president can and cannot accomplish.

manga,feo52lj,t3_eq641p,1579295230.0,"Doraemon.  Nearly every Japanese kid will know it, publishes from the early 70's into the late 90's basically none stop.  Like every kid might know scooby doo or loony toons, Doraemon is basically the same thing for Japan that sorta character/series thats EVERYWHERE for kids media.  
The basic premise is that a robot cat from the future goes back in time to help a ""current"" school boy who has problems with studying, bullying, and general young boy associated problems.  Doraemon the robot cat is basically known for always having some odd gadget for a situation, the boy tries to use it to shortcut to a better situation only to mess up more in the process instead of just doing the right thing from the start (well thats probably the most common story line). 

Pokemon.  Its very well known I probably don't even have to explain it.  It has a lot of official translation available through Viz Media both digital and print.  
Of note though the ""Pokemon Adventures"" aka the very first one from the 90's is actually famously ""a little graphic"".  In a few situations instead of having a pokemon just get knocked out or disappear back into its ball a snake pokemon gets cut in half or stuff like that.  That said basically every series beyond that is about as kids friendly as the TV show which is to say very kids friendly... honestly from 10yr olds would probably love the original adventures if they think they are ""too old"" for Pokemon.  

Splatoon has its own manga, this is a sorta popular current Nintendo game about squidkids with paint/ink guns that go around spraying everything their color.  I never really got into it as a manga but I'm told its good and it is a decently popular game the kids could be exposed to already.  

Hikaru no Go.  Boy is possessed by the spirit of an ancient Go player, so he plays go and gets better and the ghost helps him.  Its not action oriented, its not full of ""adventure"", instead its about go.  For a kid that wants something a bit less kid-ish and something more thought provoking this could be an easy choice.  Possibly even get some kids playing go, who knows.  

Card Captor Sakura/Cardcaptors.  Its a ""magical girl series"" normal little girl gets magical powers and fights with ""cards"" that summon monsters and such.  Basically if you want something decidedly ""girly"" where some girls might not be into something like Pokemon, Doraemon, or Hiraku no Go all which have boys as protaganists.  It also has a lot more ""girly"" themes like a mysterious cute boy the girl has crush on, costume changes, and stuff like that .  

Ninja Baseball Kyuma.  Boy trains in the mountains to become a ninja, boy mistakes pitching coach as ninja master to further his training and ends up playing baseball.  There are a lot of very kids friendly sports manga out there if thats your cup of tea, this is just one of them thats aimed at a younger audience and has a bit of goofiness to it too.  


Sailor Moon/Dragon Ball/Naruto.  These are all possibly a couple years ahead of elementary school kids, but they are also something they are probably familiar with and would probably want to try reading just because they know it, they've seen the movies/shows, whatever.  I'd say they are more ""middle school than elementary school"" but if all it takes to get a kid interested in reading is the premise of a cool action series ""they arn't supposed to""... hell that could mean everything.  
These series arn't exactly graphic or anything, they are just squarely aimed at slightly older kids.  More romance, more teenage problems, more fighting, possibly the main character losing... you know that sorta stuff."
projectgorgon,fenw9tk,t3_epyrl1,1579291768.0,"I'd centralize around a direct damage skill you like.  You mentioned Fire Magic and thats an option but its a hard skill to jump into starting out due to how its leveled.  

You have sword by default and thats a very capable skill direct damage skill line.  You can combo that with Necro.  Necro has a one or two mods that debuff slash damage, and sword is naturally a lot of slash damage.  Necro has some useful support stuff like spleen and heart power increasing your health and power pools.  You still get some pets to work with too.  

Want to say fuck that necro shit?  You can jump on Sword/Shield a classic that works just fine.  If you have shield leveled up you can eventually swap to Fire/Shield which will give you much better AoE farming... or you could just try going straight to Fire/Shield.  

The TL;DR here is that you were seemingly focusing on ""supportive skills"" and not actually just grabbing a mainline skill to just get the job done.  You GENERALLY want atleast one skill line thats most just attacks and doesn't rely on pets or other stuff and then one of those supportive skills to back it up."
PublicFreakout,feldlbv,t1_fel8k65,1579219680.0,"I am in no way saying that the NHS, or any other socialized healthcare system will deny people hearing aids.  I am however saying that if ANY healthcare system regardless of how its funded tests a persons hearing and determines that as a child a hearing aid would not truly benefit them... they would not give them a hearing aid.  
Thats the entire point I'm trying to make here.  Either the testing as a child was in error, and/or as he grew and developed into an adult his ears and hearing changed enough to the point that hearing aids actually had a tangible effect both are very much possible and both situations play out IDENTICALLY regardless of if hes in America, UK, Finland, China, or fucking Timbuktu."
projectgorgon,fel230f,t3_epog0o,1579212382.0,"Not to my knowledge.  The only reason you should consider avoiding a skill line at this point is just from the investment needed to unlock it, unlock abilities for it, and similar such things not the skills themselves.  

For example something unlike ""unarmed"" is super safe.  Its a default skill with no real need to go out and specifically unlock anything.  There are skill books for it but most skill lines have that, along with some skills learned from favor/rep with various npcs and such.  
It performs well enough, it has performed well enough for a good long while, and you can make it work just fine.  

Then you have something like Fire Magic, you have to go out of your way to unlock it, its not particular hard or time consuming but it is something.  It needs specialized equipment (a fire staff) which you can get a basic vanilla one VERY cheap so its not a huge deal but its something.  
Then the big deal is that unlike other skills where you learn skills as you level up and then get some npc favor/rep and/or skill books for others Fire Magic instead has you train ""recipes"" from trainers, and then do those recipes X number of times to get all spells for that level range which requires using materials to do those recipes like Fire Salts, Saltpeter, etc which means it has a much higher cost to actually level up and train in than say a more ""safe"" option.  

Then you have something like Bard, you have to get some favor, get some skill with a lute, and then you can get the skill from a trainer.  Once you have it unlocked it goes to ""normal"" with getting skills from leveling up and trainers, but it runs into issues against with ""level breaks"" where to unlock 51-60 requires you to get all sorts of skills with things like performance which includes things like dancing, various other insturments, etc which can cost a lot of time and ingame money to do compared to say something more safe like Unarmed which could just be a basic favor grind with a trainer.  

The thing with Project Gorgon skills is that even if a skill line has a particuar weakness, you can overcome it with your secondary skill.  Fire magic causes a lot of aggro generation and fills up enemies rage meters faster (aka they use special attacks like stuns more often/faster).  But you can combine it with say the Shield skill and suddenly you don't care about that, it might not be optimal DPS but now you can tank the damage, have some skills to reduce rage, and you can even push for a damage reflection build and basically make a sort of tank build out of fire/shield.  Or you can approach the problem with a healing skill line instead so you have some buffs/heals to help you endure the damage and in groups you could use armor with reduced threat generation for instance priest gives a few heals and has some fire magic skills/buffs of its own and can sorta combo out nicely as a backline skill duo.  
Its the same problem with Fire Magic having problems/weakness/whatever you want to call it, but you can handle those in very different ways.  

Your issues are not going to come from the skills themselves, but will come from making bad skill combinations and/or having problems learning all the skills or progressing past 50 with some skills having more harsh requirements to unlock, learn, or level break. 

To give an example of a ""bad"" skill combination.  Bard/Unarmed (since both were mentioned above too).  Bard is ranged, and it wants to use both of its hands for instruments.  Unarmed is melee and wants to be unarmed (shock!) or use brace knuckles/claws/similar type unarmed weapons.  So in practical terms you arn't getting any real benefits out of this combo, either your unarmed is doing alright and Bard is basically pointless or you Bard is doing alright but your Unarmed is basically pointless.  They are fighting over equipment slots and they arn't solving either skills ""problems"".  
Where as  you could combine Unarmed or Bard with say Animal Handling.  Animal Handling doesn't use your hands at all leaving both Unarmed and Bard free to do whatever they want and Animal Handling is free to do as it pleases.  Is Unarmed/Animal Handling a particularly good combo?  Probably not, but its a ""workable"" combo because both skills are getting full value without issue even if they arn't working together super well.  


If you really wanted an ""avoid this skill!"" kinda thing...  Maybe Knife Fighting?  You can 100% make Knife Fighting work, and its not particular hard to train or anything.  That said it wants your mainhand to be a knife, even if it gives you an open off hand (or you can dual wield knives).  The problem is that you generally want a tank with your Knife Fighting so you can get backstab bonuses.  The problem is none of the pet skills really ""tank"" well enough to enable this outside of maybe a single opening hit.  Knife Fighting/Animal Hanlding sorta make sense and it DOES work.  Knife Fighting among other things has poison skills and some animal handling pets have a poison damage debuff increasing your poison damage, the pet can kinda sorta grab aggro for 1-2 backstab attacks if you take it slow.  
You can put in a fair amount of work and make it function, but realistically you could also just take a more ""main stream"" combo (like say Fire/Shield above) and just walk through everything slaughtering groups with AoE easily and without trying to combo abilities between you and a pet.  That is probably the example of the worst ""real setup"" you can try, and it still works well enough to kill the toughest enemies in the game.  

So with all of that in mind, just play what you want.  It really does hold true.  You might have more or less hurdles in your path depending on what you want to play but this is not something that will lead you down a path of ruin and wasted effort unless it turns out you just think fire magic sucks after trying it out or something.  PvP basically doesn't exist, and even if they do add real PvP aspects to the game the devs have said it will never be a focus.  What that means is that any ""meta"" is about killing something 3 seconds faster, or something like that not actually about being able to do it or not or having to directly compete with a meta build."
PublicFreakout,fekrw8t,t1_fekmfgy,1579206329.0,"If a doctor said ""they arn't needed, or wouln't make a significant difference"" almost any sort of actual medical review board as part of an NHS would have said ""nope lul"" too.

manga,fekqhyh,t3_epo6rs,1579205511.0,"Kusuriya no Hitorigoto

Its a current monthly publication manga, and that monthly publication keeps it from being hyper popular within english manga community that thrives on constant weekly releases.  

Its a story about a girl/young woman who is decently educated/smart and has an obsession with medicine who is kidnapped and sold to the imperial harem (lots of ancient china influence but not actually in china?).  There she tries to hide her knowledge and not standout acting as a servant girl sweeping floods and doing basic cleaning duties.  
A few of the infants from the harem are sick, and nobody in the harem can figure out why.  She hears about it and uses her knowledge to help the situation, but is sorta kinda found out in the process.  

Even with it being set in a literal harem its not a harem romance series.  There are not tons of panty shots or anything like that.  Even with a ""strong female lead"" the story is good and engaging and doesn't pander to political bullshit.  
If I had to compare it to anything, it would be something like say Dr. House the TV show.  The MC is a very smart ""doctor"" and shes uses her knowledge to figure out diseases, treat them, try to keep herself out of the spotlight, and sometimes solve problems for people unrelated to diseases.

AskReddit,fekozwm,t3_epj100,1579204614.0,"Man I could list countless games but I'm gonna leave one.  


Project Gorgon.  Visually it looks like ass, but mechanically this is a game that is truly doing some amazing things.  Its an MMO made by a husband and wife team who used to work on older MMO's like Asheron's Call, so this means development is really slow but it also means its basically very capable people just making a passion project of a game.  As it stands its early access and likely will be for another year or three, but its a simple buy to play model with ZERO microtransactions, no subscriptions, nothing.  Just buy the game, you play it, its an MMO.   It takes some interesting twists on your tab-target style MMO's.  For instance ""armor"" is like a health bar, and while damage does go to your health through the armor bar its mitigation that gets stronger or weaker depending on how empty/full the armor bar is and this applies to you and all enemies (some enemies don't have armor so its empty).  It lets  you freely combine any two combat skills you want, want to be a fire wizard whose sorta tanky and taunts enemies close for fire reflection damage and close range AOE?  Combine Fire with the Shield skills and now you can taunt, shield bash, and so on like a tank, but you still have all your fire magic.  Want to be a ranger with a pet and archery?  Combine Archer + Animal Handling.  Want to a monk that uses martial arts and the powers of the mind?  Go Unarmed + Mentalism.  Just about any sort of character you can think of that would exist in a fantasy setting you can get, or atleast get close to be combing various skills.  You can wear plate armor or cloth armor on anyone and its basically just you changing durability vs resource sustain or going leather and being somewhere in between.  
It has ""skills"" for everything, even dying is a skill. First time getting your head caved in by skeleton with a club?  Congrats you got dying XP for it.  Nearly everything you do has associated skills.  

Want actual interesting quests/challenges?  There is no magic quest markeres, there is no question marks and exclamation marks.  You need to talk to to NPCs, actually read what they say, and act accordingly.  There is a note pad built into the game so you can more easily track information.  A dungeon might have a riddle near the start and the answer to that riddle could be what opens up a barrier/force field. You are stuck on an island to start with and one of the various ways off is to find teleport coordinates from pillars around the island to get another NPC with teleportation skills to help you off the island (assuming you don't take another route off), thats not ""go click on a quest item, then run back"" thats go jot down numbers from pillars, get the right order of the numbers based on clues, then hand it over and if you give them the wrong teleportation code you could end up somewhere else entirely or worse.  

Its a relatively small community probably only averaging around 100-200 people online at any time, but you'll see people around.  The small community means people are generally pretty helpful.  There are actual community events staged by the admins.  Sometimes its crazy stuff like spawning a kraken boss in a town, sometimes its people getting together for a weekly ""poetry jam"" so people can level of their relate poetry skills easier and just have an ingame party basically.  

So I really think Project Gorgon is the sort of MMO a very specific set of players have been wanting/dreaming for.  Even if its visuals and rough around the edges feel hold it back mechanically its doing truly fun and interesting stuff and its doing it in a game with no microtransactions, no bullshit, its all about actually playing the game and actually accomplishing stuff.  


So there you go, an early access game by a husband and wife duo who are long time MMO developer vets.  Its a pure passion project and only averages a few hundred players a day tops.  It has its very clear issues with graphics.  Yet it also has very clear strengths that make it stand above most others in terms of mechanics.

If you are in a position to just say fuck it and throw money around like a baller, then yeah go for whatever.  Though if you are at all on a remotely realistic budget, 1080p at 144hz should be the goal you shoot for.  
Ideally this is backed up by a computer capable of breaking 100fps for most titles you intent to be playing (pretty easy for stuff like CounterSuck, Dota2, or whatever random ""esports"" you might care about... harder for serious graphical games).  

You can push higher resolutions, but honestly going from 1080p to 2k or 4k is nowhere near the jump in experience/quality that going to 144hz is assuming you have the fps/comp performance to back it up.  You will have a legit difference in how well you play, how fast you react, all that sorta shit.  1080p to 4k...  maybe the game looks better if they offer a 4k texture pack and you comp can handle it?"

worldnews,feh1cqh,t1_fegnwj3,1579107090.0,"There was once the Arab spring, and from it a guy named Morsi rose to power.  People thought it would bring ""hope"" and ""change"" for the better.  All it really brought was Muslim Brotherhood bullshit that many hated.  Morsi tried to put forth a new constitution, and it was met with near endless hate, to point that they redid the constitution again to get it threw but by that point too many people were fed up with his bullshit and it was clear there was no ""hope"" and seemingly the only ""change"" was for the worse.  

Morsi was overthrown, the constitution was suspended, and he was put on trial for espionage/treason for his support of terrorist groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, etc, and that ""etc"" including the Iranian Republican Guard.  Giving classified information to Quatar.  He was also charged with escaping prison (which he did do) from 2011 when a group of Muslim Brotherhood people were broken out of prison during the protests. Among the charges were also various things about torture and murder of protesters after he came to power (and attacks against counter protesters during the revolution)
Why all the stuff about terrorists/Iranian ties?  The opposition to the Muslim Brotherhood saw them as basically Iranian backed people wanting a theocracy similar to that brought about in Iran.  This included those terrorist groups being tied to the prison break that freed Morsi and other Muslim Brotherhood members and were responsible for many of instances of violence during the revolution from ""civilians"".  

Across those legion of charges he got 20 years for that, death for another, life for this.  The death penalty charge was overturned to life because Turkey and others got all upset about it.  Regardless it didn't matter much he received pretty shitty treatment in prison and died in prison.  He died of a heart attack, but its believed to have been caused from underlying health issues that went ignored/not properly treated and is largely blamed on his treatment in prison.  

The military backed coup put a dude named Mansour in power as interm president.  Among other things he brought back the position of Vice President and similar positions since Morsi and his various constitutions had removed such positions.  He setup the new elections afterwards, said ""yo I'm not seeking election I'm going back to being a judge"" and then a dude named Sisi took over.  Sisi was the now retired general who originally overthrew Morsi in the first place and by many in Egypt was seen rather favorably/fondly, he was seen as a patriot who would rise above religion and bullshit to support Egypt.  
Turns out basically once Sisi was in power though he basically forced his way into becoming a dictator and running the nation much like he ran his military unit as a General.  


And that is the legacy of Egypt in the past decade, revolutions ontop of revolutions and Egypt getting fucked regardless of who they put at the helm.  Some people will try to say the Muslim Brotherhood arn't so bad, that Morsi was a heroic and mistreated figure.  Others will say Sisi isn't so bad and better than Mubarak ever was.  Mostly its all bullshit, Egypt was in the shit, they stirred the shit pot, and now they are still in the shit."
projectgorgon,fefin9a,t3_eomges,1579057112.0,"Its somewhere in between the two examples you are giving.  

Progression/character strength matters.  Having a fancy high end set of plate armor such as ""knight plate"" can make you feel like an untouchable god early on.  
That said you arn't gated by anything beyond your power, and you can compensate for your personal failings with a group (this is an MMO after all).  Want to get off the island and head right for Eltibule?  You can do it, the monsters there will probably kick your ass but if you have a group it would be sorta like doing a dungeon.  You talk to the NPC's?  You can accept their quests, actually complete them assuming you find a group/way to kill them (assuming they involve killing things), you can build up favor, learn skills from them, etc.  You can't level gated from going to Eltibule like a theme park MMO would do, but you'll have a hard time dealing with monsters there without getting stronger and/or having a group to effective be stronger.  

Some zones will just kick your ass regardless of power unless you are prepared for them.  Kur Mountains is a great example, its a frozen wasteland, and even if you can handle the monsters there if you arn't prepared to keep warm with various abilities, equipment, consumables, SOMETHING you will freeze to death.  Even if you are basically a max level character, unless you take precautions to deal with the cold it will still wreck you.  
The same applies with dehydrating in the desert zone, you'll need to bring water or something else to make sure you get through it without dying.  Again this is regardless of power/level.  But your fresh faced nublet ass can get a bunch of bottles of water and go adventuring in the desert longer than a max strength character that didn't (even though the monsters there would probably wreck you).  

There is not a strict progression in terms of ""do this zone, which leads to this zone, which leads to this zone"" and it just continues on and on and on.  Assuming you teleport off the island and end up in Serbule you can stay in that zone till lv30 or more on many skills and not feel the xp pinch too hard or anything.  Or you can head to the Hills and get a similar experience in a different zone (and its where you end up if you leave the island by the dungeon). I've found most people sorta end up rotating between Serbule, Serbule Hills, and Eltibule which are all connected zones near where you start as it will train you most skills, and give you multiple dungeons and all sorts of things to do between those 3.   You could also just say ""fuck it the hills have nothing for me"" and just ignore the hills exist completely if you wanted.  


So while its clearly NOT a theme park progression on rails experience.  Its also not a full sandbox open world where you can just do as please.  Find someplace thats kicking your ass that you want to go?  Go with friends turn the zone into a dungeon basically until you are strong enough to solo it.  Thats a strength of an MMO that many people ignore, and its not like PG is out there stopping you from doing that and honestly I like that I personally want some progression but I don't want that rigid progression either and I think PG finds a decent place between the two."

Bernie, aka Americas silly socialist uncle.  He toes a socdem line, but if he could just let rip he'd basically be full on socialist. Hes big on increasing taxes, and is pretty famous for pushing a policy of basically doubling the federal minimum wage (from $7 to $15 basically).  
Hes really into unions, worker owned cooperatives, and that sort of stuff.  People are going to crucify me for calling him socialist, and a lot of the policies he campaigns on arn't truly socialist but his actual desires are more than what he projects as policy alone and hes said as much.  

Andrew MOTHERFUCKING Yang.  Asian American dude who is ""young"" compared to the rest of these people who basically qualify for social security.  He has some interesting/unqiue policies and represents basically the only candidate currently pushing for UBI or universal basic income, its very like Bernie and Warren would support UBI but they arn't going to campaign on it.  
Hes also something of an outsider, hes not a party dude and hes getting sorta shafted by the media and the democratic party not unlike what happened to Bernie 4 years ago.  Thats also specifically why I made sure to include him.

Manga?  It would depend heavily on the series in question.  

Something like Kingdom?  You will want to commit sodoku, its twisting Chinese and Japanese together in sometimes confusing ways unless you are really fucking on point and know a lot of surrounding history and characters around it.  

Things like Doraemon and Pokemon are designed to be ""child friendly"" not just in terms of content, but also in terms of literary difficulty.  

So if you wanted to do something like that, look for kids manga.  It might not be the most interesting, but it should work out well enough for your purposes of having ""actual japanese stuff"" that isn't just textbook or whatever.   

If you want something more engaging but thats probably a bit harder look towards sports manga.

I think its a movie that suffers too much from comparison to Taxi Driver and similar.  They'll see its not as grounded, real, or tangible.  Yet they ignore that parts were its unrealistic nature elevated it, particularly in the final act."
projectgorgon,fe8l3sg,t1_fe8iax0,1578927390.0,"Sorta kinda yeah.  While I think the game has interesting combat mechanics for a tab target game with stuff like armor, combat refreshes, etc making it a bit more indepth than something like WoW, EQ, etc ultimately there isn't a true ""end game"" to really dive into yet.  There are some high level dungeons and such, but really don't expect a hardcore raiding and such.  

Instead what PG really offers in quests you need to figure out, or just stumble upon as you are doing something else later down the line.  Think about how many MMO's out there offer quests where you need to track down numbers from things to figure out a code to do something.  How many MMO's have a riddle to give you a code to bypass a barrier?  These are highlights/strengths of PG, and if you just want to rush past them instead of figuring them out or seeking help elsewhere if you can't figure it out on your own PG is going to offer so many walls, barriers, and annoyances to you/your personality that you will want to quit basically every hour you play.  

That might come off a little harsh, but its the truth.  The best parts of PG are behind figuring things out, and if you don't want to figure things out you'll probably dislike the game.  
If you just want to grind skills to hell and back, its something you can certainly do but there are much better and more polished games out there allowing that."
projectgorgon,fe8h7dp,t3_eo3q3o,1578926088.0,"The barrier in the dungeon, has riddle earlier on that answers the code.  You could also just wiki it if the riddle proves too complex.  

The obelisk numbers is one of the ways off the island, by using it as a teleport coordinate (and getting teleportation help from a npc on the island).  

You could also get off the island by going deeper down the dungeon and end up in a spider dungeon on the mainland.  

The alerts can be scary, but they are not the end of the world.  Basically it will give you a percent chance that if you die to the boss that you will get a permanent debuff with the only way to remove that debuff being to defeat the boss.  
Generally the debuffs are more flavorful than than seriously harmful.  For instance a ""nameless boss"" gives you the ""nameless"" debuff which makes you unable to say your name in game (it gets censored basically).  
So while you might not be able to take the boss on your own, worst case scenario it gets you to interact with other people to help you take it down and get rid of the curse.  


Honestly speaking, if you wanted to rush off newbie island... the game probably isn't for you from the get go.  That island represents some of the better quest content in the game, and really shows how you have multiple paths to accomplish what you want.  It rewards you for exploring and finding new things, in a game that is likely very new to you.  

I'll also say there is a really good wiki, it does allow you to rush through/push through most content that is like ""go find a person in X town"" and you can just wiki who the fuck it wants you to find, or the number code to a barrier, or whatever else instead of actually finding it out ingame through talking to NPC's, figuring out riddles, and so on."
aww,fe8f229,t1_fe672jr,1578925472.0,"As others have said sometimes it means basically wearing gear head to toe.  

Though this also depends heavily on the climate.   Fishing off the Florida Keys?  Yeah you are probably wearing next to nothing.  Some sort of proper footwear, swim trunks, MAYBE a shirt/hat depending on how concerned you are with sunburns.   Even with water getting all over the boat and you it will be evaporating in short order.  

Shrimp boat like from Forest Gump?  Basically the same deal, but instead you might put on a coverall/overall style wader when bringing the nets in, but otherwise keep it off.  
You'll find plenty of pictures of dudes in a bathing suit/shorts, and with big boots and thats basically it.  That is very nearly the uniform for working boats in hot climates.  

Crabbing in the frozen north?  long johns under everything, water proof grippy boots, water proof overall style waders, water proof jacket over that, gloves that seal the sleeves besides that.  Its pretty pricey and requires a lot of coverage and specialized gear.  Well technically you can do it without, but its a lot more likely you'll catch some disease and/or just be completely miserable.  

So while the people who responded weren't wrong, they also sorta just focused on the frozen north aspect and ignored other climates."
