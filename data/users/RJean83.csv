dadswhodidnotwantpets,ffgo558,t1_ffgckyb,1579910811.0,"It took 2 solid weeks of my cat staring at the fountain suspiciously before she decided it was okay. But we would have to set up the $40 fountain, a bowl of water, turn on the faucet a little when we brush our teeth, and she *still* preferred whatever water we are drinking.

Cats are, just, so great."

tamorapierce,fee8d2f,t1_fee7c2i,1579028498.0,Good point. I haven't had luck finding Sandry's book on amazon (Amazon...failed me??) But I will see if I can find the box set
cats,fdqwy4f,t3_emp6gd,1578676043.0,"That is how my cat got my husband when we adopted her. He went to pet her head, she damn near melted on him, and now she is on my desk chair for life.

No regrets."
cats,fdnl5de,t1_fdndmsr,1578588089.0,"Had to take my cat to the vet 3 times over the Christmas/New Year's break. Each time, she would let out so many little mews, like she knew the Uber driver would free her if she was sad enough.

All you can do is say ""I know"" and get there asap."

cats,fddl4pu,t3_ektrx4,1578316441.0,"His little ears!!!


For food, what was the shelter feeding him? Even if it was poor quality, keep him on that for a bit as he adjusts to his surroundings. You are going to be great and Jake is adorable."
Parenting,fddku7i,t3_ektuxg,1578316141.0,You signed a release form for the school. Is this associated with the school in any way? Or is it just for the teacher's brand?
ynab,fddhson,t3_eka21m,1578312847.0,"It makes me think of when I was a kid, and my parents paid my allowance into 3 piggie banks: one for savings, one for spending, and one for charity.


The charity was often the local animal shelter, and we would haul my bag of change there every six months or so. Savings were bigger purchases, and had to be approved by my parents, but were still fun things. Spending was whatever I wanted.


The big problem with getting kids to save into something for adulthood is that they barely have the patience for something a few weeks from now, let alone the abstract time of adulthood. Patience is a skill that needs to he developed, but starting with smaller steps (like saving for months for a big thing) is more feasible"
askTO,fdcu8hj,t3_ekjz6u,1578284461.0,"My mom had something similar happen to her. She was downtown, waiting for the light, when a total stranger hit her in the back of the head, knocking off her glasses. He then ground his foot into her glasses, pulverizing them.


All she could to was file a police report on the non-emergency line, and give details to her best description. It is unlikely anything will come of it, but at least there is a record if there is a pattern.


There are a lot of people in toronto who are dealing with a lot of problems. Please don't think you did anything to provoke this. There could be drugs, mental illness, a combination, or something else entirely. I am sorry this happened to you."
askTO,fd3qikj,t3_ejz8bd,1578160828.0,"I lived in my first apartment for 4 years. Aside from the appropriate ""hey"" and head nod (with maybe the briefest chat about how cute their dog is, or the snow), I never learned their names, and they were the best.


You might be friendlier in co-ops or condos with active boards, but not much. And that is okay."

Parenting,fcmyjph,t3_ei2jdj,1577797724.0,"Art lessons are where your child learns new skills. Practicing at home is where she improves them. If you don't encouraging practicing at home (even 10 minutes a day to make it a habit), much of the teacher's time is spent working on reinforcing last week's lesson, not going on to the next step. It can become frustrating for both teacher and student."

JusticeServed,fcjyyn3,t1_fcjxuqw,1577711085.0,"(Also not a lawyer, so law folk please correct me) Most likely there are two possibilities:

1. Plea of insanity or mental defect (he didn't  realize what he was doing at the time or that it was wrong).


2.denying the intention to murder that goes with the attempted murder charge. It could be they want it downgraded to manslaughter, or say it wasn't a hate crime if we are talking about a ""robbery gone bad"".


It will be interesting to see how it plays out, especially because (thank the universe) the victims survived."

I am happy to cut holes or other DIY steps to make it work, but would like to keep it all under $70. Any ideas on how to keep my cat out of my cables?


Edit: thank you all, got some excellent ideas for the long and short term. Looking forward to getting my game stuff sorted out for the new year. This subreddit will return to its pics of Coleman tools and thermoses. Cheers!"
