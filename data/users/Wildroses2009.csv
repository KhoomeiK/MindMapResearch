ChoosingBeggars,ffk1xqu,t3_etxm7r,1580013310.0,"My family would probably pay each other to take the precious family heirlooms off our hands. We came close with the family bibles.  My grandmother’s husband died around the same time as his mother and she was outraged when her three sister-in-laws got together and decided she would have both the ancient massive family bibles. They sat ignored in the spare room for 27 years until her nephew asked to borrow one for a family reunion. My grandmother promptly gave him both and told him not to return them, to the great relief of her children and grandchildren who had been starting to wonder who would be saddled with the damn things due to her age. If anyone tried to say “I am starting a bidding war to keep them in the family” the silence would be deafening."
darkestdungeon,ffiap9k,t3_eti3s1,1579969368.0,"I once saved a plague doctor and Abomination during the Courtyard mission and recruited both. I ended up making up a story about how they met and befriended each other while imprisoned by the bloodsuckers and hooked up during one of the hurt/comfort sessions after they’d been fed on. They were separated when the Abomination became too protective and remained a devoted couple Post rescue. 

So I don’t think a DD Abomination would necessarily be forever alone. Maybe that’s what the Plague Doctor looks like underneath the mask in a pretty dress."

PoliticalHumor,ffgoznn,t3_ete2cw,1579911411.0,"Australia and honestly I am not sure I do care anymore because that would require me to care about America and it has not been acting like a country deserving of patience and compassion right now. My contempt has been rising so long this more feels like yet more confirmation of what I already knew about the corruption, hypocrisy and idiocy of America rather than a revelation or final nail in the coffin. I have reached the stage where I want America to keep self sabotaging so I can keep watching their slide off the world stage as respected leaders and enjoy the isolation they seem to want so badly. My country is going to have to keep playing nice and sucking up because of all their trade and military power but that doesn’t mean we like them very much. 

I will be fascinated to see if the next President manages to do what Obama did and restore the horrific damage to America’s world reputation done by their predecessor but somehow I doubt much will improve. Even if the Democratic Party manages to produce a successful candidate it seems likely the Republican Senate will still be preventing anything meaningful being done."

cats,ff7y9c3,t3_es10yt,1579661217.0,Interestingly my cats are the exact opposite. My grandmother is deaf so the cats rapidly learnt that in this household the best way of communication is to use your paws and claws and they NEVER FORGET THIS EVER. There is nothing more electrifying than the claws of a hungry cat dragging you out of your video game immersion because it’s dinner time.

I discovered the hard way if it plonks on tilled soil you haven’t yet planted and fertilised then you aren’t doing either until the cat chooses to move of it’s own free will.

I mean, everyone here is all: “Aesthetics is everything” while I am “You can tell me what that word means after I have planted something because I cannot abide a free growing space. Just let me check what is in my garden chest.”

gaming,femdbgr,t3_epwp82,1579249660.0,It was the time Todd said that they made Fallout 76 because huge numbers of people still play Skyrim and Fallout 4 but they have no touch point or way of communicating with them that broke my Skyrim loving heart.

Within three minutes both my cats jumped up and settled down to sleep with a real air of “Oh thank you! We are so comfortable!” My grandmother refused to disturb them so I had to make a second bed on the couch and donate my feather doona. I slept under five blankets to stay warm that night.

StardewValley,feczeom,t3_eoedzx,1578991054.0,"I'm trying this right now too, but with a pomegranate orchard instead because Elliott is the best. The story behind it is young Lillian grew up, lasted all of two days at her first adult job in JojaMart then decided she'd rather earn a living making her famous family pomegranate jelly instead. Not that I've started it yet. I decided I needed to shake up my playstyle which was basically get absolutely everything so I put a bunch of rules in. Eat three times a day, only one crop per season can be your cash crop, ultimate aim to have pomegranate orchard. 

Summer Year 2 right now and it's playing out interestingly. The whole eat three meals a day thing was more of a game changer as it means I have to save a lot of fish and forage, and I'm growing a lot of produce just for me to eat. Being free of the polyculture, monoculture and every item shipped achievements is liberating. Because I am not getting a steady stream of cash from the farm as I wait for the melons to finish, fishing and the help wanted boards are a lot more important than they used to be. And I just got a kitchen but don't know any recipes so I'm running around throwing flowers and earth crystals at all the villages so they mail me recipes NOW. 

It's making the Community Center play out differently as well. I spent my first melon harvest on unlocking the bus because I wanted a crystalarium to produce easy twice daily friendship earth crystals, and I haven't gotten a coop or barn yet because I can get eggs and milk in winter if I have to but I only have summer to get fiddlehead ferns and autumn to get apples and pomegranates. So my limited cash is going towards a pair of trees first and then upgrading tools. It's so different to what I normally do and I'm loving it."
goodomens,fe6j7ix,t1_fe3m9hh,1578892634.0,I have read a few that had them decide to get married just because they wanted a more formal way of tying themselves to the earth they chose over heaven and hell as well as each other over their brethren. And also one where they just tell humans they are married because it is the easiest way of explaining their relationship to humans they are unwilling to share their supernatural origins with.

If their target audience keeps bursting into laughter at seeing it perhaps it is not a good trailer. Where did they find the focus testers who said it was a good ad? It’s sad really, right up until we discovered why the world was flooded I was genuinely enjoying the trailer. It was intriguing and interesting and I wanted to know more. Until I did. This must be what Mass Effect fans felt like when number three came out.

IncelTears,fcj9m5q,t1_fcj8ubx,1577680705.0,Well...I personally joined Instagram because I wanted to look at pictures of cats and fan art of the Ineffable Husbands of Good Omens. Which I do. Exclusively. So when I am on Instagram looking at beautiful non human creatures having amazing experiences I think: “Wtf am I doing with my life because I somehow NAILED IT! I would change nothing!

Me in the middle of every save file: “I will be your 90’s Disney Princess, my sweet Prince.”

I am not sure why I cannot move on from him. The fact he is mature and doesn’t act like a teenager is a plus. I also like his writing job is one he can do in the house while I am out farming so someone is watching the children. I kind of relate to all his long hair struggles and vanity as well. And his bad poetry and flowery language is hilarious. 

I suppose he is the only one who caught my imagination. I glomped onto the fanon theory he is a merman, fill the house with bookcases and plants because of his interest in reading and gardening, decided he writes and published the other two novels in the farmhouse and would imagine him and my farmer bickering over the breakfast table about whether or not he is allowed to publish his erotic love poetry about her. I never really imagined what married life with the other candidates would be like the way I did with Elliott."
