relationship_advice,ff84q99,t1_ff845qx,1579665942.0,"I just don't want to pressure her with more issues than she already has, I'm a nice guy, I accept everything and trust her fully I have no reason not to do so. I just don't know if she feels like a burden as I do in this situation. I don't want to come in while she in a down and brooding time in her life and break up just cause she didn't care at that moment.  


I think if I can find her in a better mood, I will do this though... I don't know how I'm gonna be able to handle it, she helped me in my darkest of times with my moms passing, so the thought makes my chest like 200 pounds heavier.... I hope I can even muster up the strength to say this.mom's"

I don't know what chronic pain is like but I've dealt with chronic numbness of my emotions for an equal length of time. A lot of us feel useless here, haven't done much with life; got to shorten it to a smaller picture & just start focusing on what you can do this day or tomorrow.  Sometimes you just have to say so what to people who doubt you, you know your body better than anyone so forget those who don't believe you, your struggle is as real as anybody."

depression,fei2yx7,t1_fei2ebk,1579129133.0,"Yeah, I'm currently trying to do the gym thing, But it's hard without the willpower and self motivation. I just don't care about myself, I put out multiple messages trying to find a gym buddy or even just a meetup group. I can't wait for the day where I say fuck it and take the step to enter the gym every day, as for dating apps I'm good on that side, I do have a girl; she is just attending class states away so our time together is very short. She is the only person, keeping me bound to this mortal plane and my biggest cheerleader, I'm just so sick of putting all my burdens on her; as she could do infinitely better than myself."
Needafriend,fei1tbq,t1_fei1avs,1579128423.0,"I'm not that picky, anything that can hold my interest within the first 10-20 mins, rather comedy, action, foreign movies or animated. Star Wars was the last big movie I've seen."
depression,fehyx38,t1_fehy6b5,1579126676.0,"Sounds like great idea's, sadly I don't think my therapist is all that good; He mostly let's me blab on and on and then gives very short brief replies, that are kinda generic. I am currently seeking a way to switch out and change to a different person; as for interactions, I don't really get a chance to do so as most group places I've looked up are almost 3 transfers away and basically a full days commute and while a bunch of interactions could possibly happen during those days, My anxiety murders any willpower to take a step and just go wait in the cold at bus stops. I've been on Medication for almost 17 years now & I honestly don't know if they are hindering or helping, I feel nothing when on them or off of them when I've quit them out of pure tiredness of waking up/going to bed to swallow 3-4 pills a day/night."
Needafriend,fehyk3l,t1_fehxz6c,1579126462.0,"Of course, I play 5th edition it's not that hard. You basically roll the dice (mostly a d20, which is a 20 sided die) and add the bonus from your characters sheet to it to perform an action. At it's core it's very simple, you can roll anything at times from a d4 up to a d100; the dice control the outcome and fate of your character & depending on your dungeon master they can be really funny with bad low rolls, or do awesome things if you roll well enough. It's great with friends & people; you just need a few source books or an online program like Roll20, Fantasy grounds or D&D Beyond."
depression,fehwu94,t3_ep842q,1579125447.0,"I feel this, all my friends moved out of state and forgot about me. My sister & Mother passed away over the last two years, I am alone; seeking friends and yet nobody cares when I speak up or try to talk to them. I just would like to know what it is to feel special or meaningful to someone before I die, but it seems rather I'm just left to sit alone in an apartment all day looking at white walls."
depression,fehtefp,t1_fefgnfc,1579123500.0,"I know she will leave me at some point, I'm pathetic and there is no way I could ever give her the future she deserves, I'm probably selfish for keeping her even now... I try to push her away, I tell her I'm not going to get better and she just smiles at me and says it's okay. I don't understand... she just must be in a rut herself and needs me to past the days is the only thing my brain can put together."
depression,feeyf1q,t3_eohnl9,1579043953.0,Wish I could find the strength to force myself through another day.. I'd rather just lay in bed til I die.
depression,feey7q4,t3_eood26,1579043822.0,"I know what you mean, I think I found it in a girl I'm currently dating; but I'm so afraid the moment I do something wrong she will kick me to the curve and I'll be back to suicidal thoughts. She let's me be free and vulnerable & idk what's gonna happen when she realizes how pathetic I am"
depression,fdi7siv,t3_eliy7z,1578437270.0,"I've been in this situation and I can't stress that simple communication is key; with my friend, I never wanted to bother them. One day, I broke and just talked to them, even how I never brought anything up with them because I didn't want to be a burden & he laughed in my face. I was always so worried about bothering him, he was the only friend I had, so I was terrified of speaking up or saying anything that would make me truly alone. Honesty with him I think saved our friendship because I didn't distance myself.. so honestly, people are different some want to listen, others want nothing to with that. I would put it out there and just find out the type of friend you are dealing with, so you can surround yourself with a support system vs hiding your feelings, it's never worth bottling up emotions; everyone needs to be able to talk, just gotta test the waters and find those friends."
depression,fdi4ji2,t3_elhy1h,1578435606.0,"Well, first off I am sorry that does sound like it sucks, sadly I don't know the pain portion of your struggles but as I deal with a more mental disability in schizophrenia; I do know the issue of growing up; seeing multiple therapist & living a alone with it. Talking helps, therapist don't always do so. I know, I feel better talking to my online friend any day, than I have any of the therapist I've seen over my lifetime (started when I was 12, currently 29). I hope you find someone to talk too, I really do. You may think this is cheesy but hey, you dealt with this issue for so long and made it this far. Let me just say good job, from my point of view, it's a strong personal showing  of your willpower. So, keep talking to anyone willing to listen, any site you can find; you got this."
depression,fdi3xvp,t3_elhigv,1578435301.0,Good-job! I'm going on 2 weeks myself; I'll get out at some point. I hope it was nice out and that you want to do it again!
depression,fdi3rup,t3_elhxst,1578435219.0,"Nice, proud of you.   
I'm still fighting to do this, myself my fucking apartment is a mess and I'm supposed to have company this weekend."
depression,fdi3nqs,t3_elijdf,1578435161.0,"I've been that way since my mother past the day before Thanksgiving; It's rough, but sometimes the brain does what it needs to protect us. Hopefully, there will be something that makes us feel again, that's why I still get out of bed and do anything social, just for the random chance in life I feel something while doing it. Wouldn't surprise me if you have a story to tell about something overly emotional that has put you here. You probably just need to reset emotionally, so don't think on it to hard, and take it easy for alittle bit."
depression,fdi1avw,t1_fdhzljq,1578433974.0,"Sometimes people wanna hear cheesy things, I don't mind it at all & look forward to saying it back at you for going to therapy; It's different for people, I've had a therapist since I was 12, currently 29 so I've met quite a few of them; don't be afraid to try and find the right one for you. A good listener and conversationalist was what I needed; more so a nod-man who just goes ""I'm sorry to hear"" constantly."
depression,fdhz4fx,t1_fdhxlpi,1578432801.0,"I hope we are both around to have that convo for sure! Just thank you for reading and such, I'm just a defeatist at heart."
depression,fctd8rq,t1_fct9s02,1577939601.0,"I wish, I'm almost 30; all attempts at merging into society have always ended in failure. For these last few years, death is all I've wanted & I pretty much gave up. I don't feel anything, no care for what my mother would want sadly, no care for the two family members that check in monthly would want etc. I just stare at a blank wall and maybe check my phone from time to time.. I'm a waste of air currently with no improvement in sight at the age of 29."
depression,fct5ib4,t3_eikclj,1577933405.0,"Sorry for your lost, I lost my mother the day before Thanksgiving 2019, I have yet to shed a tear; I have called out and cursed the heavens so many times. It's okay to grieve some of us can't, I felt nothing outside of a little anger and she was my best friend."
depression,fcrvbqg,t1_fcpk7uk,1577907106.0,"Probably, but it's there. It is in my mind and I feel serious about it; I'm letting people know; but again, I don't really feel like it has to be a major change. Guess reverse psychology on myself hopefully? I just don't belong here & I don't think anyone else believes that I do either; I don't hide my depression or suicidal thoughts from people and it's always simply ""Prayers for you, sweetie"""
depression,fclpvid,t3_ehuzqg,1577753575.0,"I don't think it's needy at all, I am also like this. It's dumb nice to feel wanted, I know every time I get a taste of it I feel better about myself in general; so keep searching, if you need to talk I'm sure there are plenty of people here including myself."
