There's also a subreddit that got the rules ""dont repost top 10 post from all time"" cuz of this type of video. Yeah it's funny. But if u wanna repost it, repost it 6 or 7 months later. Cuz of this video got so many upvote, it will appear back in relevant subreddit like r/instant_regret.

How much of phatetic loser do u have to be to called someone a troll which u cant proved it and attack on..... What? Shower thought? Which got only one post about it on my acc. oof.

PublicFreakout,ff5s0dy,t1_ff5rnzg,1579608007.0,"Ouh wow. Looking at all of the conversation i feel like so amused right now. First - correct my term of using wamen rather than woman/ women that not in anyway from what's the point is . Second - saying I'm a troll. When i try to deny it, u try check my acc history and u found out that I'm not a troll. Third - u know u are the one at the fault here rather than acknowledge u are the one at the fault here, u trying to giv me lesson and pity my online persona and making u feel better than me. Which is definitely not in any way of what the original point is. I'm starting to see a pattern here."

PublicFreakout,ff5ricq,t1_ff5r3dn,1579607411.0,Ouh. They meant troll in urban dictionary? Ok sure. The real reason why i type wamen rather than woman cuz i dont know  should i type woman or women in certain situations. English is not my native language. So my bad if u mad at my word using choices since u oblivious whats my point in the whole conversation.
PublicFreakout,ff5ra97,t1_ff5qyw3,1579607141.0,And.... Thats what rape is (no consent from the other partner) . What are you trying to do?.  My point is that men rapist are as bad as women rapist. (rape is rape)
PublicFreakout,ff5r14s,t1_ff5qk8t,1579606825.0,"No. I'm not. Some people having their own comfortable thing when writing. For example, writing (color rather than colour) since its got the same meaning. My point is that no matter how bad the word is, if u understand it, whats the matter? Why do u feel the need of correct the other person to follow common thing in something thats not a problem at all?"
PublicFreakout,ff5qs19,t1_ff5qg0q,1579606499.0,How so? Because of they being oppressed in the past?

PublicFreakout,ff5q2sl,t1_ff5pn0c,1579605560.0,"Then how should i adress raping in equal rights? 
 
I felt like if I was trying to proved a point about equal rights in racism, ( racism against white people are as bad as racism against black people) people would be like : ""no. Racism against white people is much more better than racism against black people."" ""racism is bad. Dont talk about racism"". 
 
Listen : the more u trying to run away from it, the more it will continue. Just accept it and change. Racism is Racism. Rape is Rape. Fight is Fight. Nothing in the world is favoring only one side."

Hit back - pussy. Need to get kick on the balls. 
 
[SOCIETY].
 
Its funny how women wanted equal rights in everything but not in something that puts them at disadvantages . For examples : rapes, fights,etc.
They mad when men rape a wamen but not mad when wamen rape a men. Instead, they mad at the men for saying the wamen rape him. (I'm not in anyway to approve of raping. I'm trying to prove a point and yes, raping a bad thing since it's a common sense. I'm not being a sarcasm.) fights - if you know the other opponent is stronger than u, dont fight. Smh. Dont hit them and thought he won't hit u back."
