Prove anything that Jeff bezos says is true other than that article that talks about them bringing a investigation to the United Nations, their is nothing specific in there at all. Other than him thinking he got a virus through WhatsApp. Literally at the beginning of all of this Gavin De Decker said Michael Sanchez was the one that leaked it. I mean what else do you want. I mean it's weird that AMI would say that he is the one who leaked, he then says he denies it but then he says he took a $200,000 payment from them. So which is it? I don't understand why it's detrimental that AMI is the source. I get it that they had some beef between bezos Trump and AMI's director, but it makes very little sense that Michael Sanchez would then admit taking $200,000 from them.

technology,ff943a7,t1_ff8kmsy,1579704360.0,"Wrong. The term ‚Äúzero-day‚Äù refers to a newly discovered software¬†vulnerability. Because the developer has just learned of the flaw, it also means an official patch or update to fix the issue hasn't been released. ... But the software vendor may fail to release a patch before hackers manage to¬†exploit¬†the security hole. So...

Edit: That is literally the first definition of ""zero day exploits"" when you Google it. Armchairing it hard."

Totally possible in a best case scenario, I just don't buy it that this guy would not be updated.
