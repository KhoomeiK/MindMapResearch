3* avenger

*stats*

Strength E: the only strength an army could ever truely have is numbers

Endurance A+: it is not uncommon for an army to fight till the last man falls or the last weapon is blunted

Agility C: often marching onward and taking some formation or another

Mana E: not much magic to be had amongst nameless soldiers

Luck E-: nothing could be worse than being on the front lines

Noble Phantasm: D

*Passive skills*

Persistance in adversity A: increase NP gain from being attacked

Madness enhancement B: increases buster card effectiveness

Dug in trenches D: decrease damage taken by 100 

*skills*

for the homeland C: increase NP gain when attacked for 3 turns

Decoy B: apply target focus for yourself and greatly increase attack for all allies except yourself for 1 turn

Glory to the king A: decrease HP by 2000 and increase attack for all [king] allies for 3 turns

*Noble Phantasm*

March on the enemy: deal high special attack damage to all non [king] enemies and increase defense for all [king] allies for 3 turns

*conclusion*

The main appeal to this servant would obviously be how other servants react to them which to me is the best part about fate in general"
