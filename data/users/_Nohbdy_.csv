WTFwish,ffd75t1,t3_esline,1579814737.0,Hard to say how much makeup she's wearing in each image. This might possibly be a rare sighting of a black woman wearing blackface.
justlegbeardthings,ff9n6uz,t1_ff9c4st,1579716510.0,"You're guilty of not catering to their emotions. Doing so might make them happy (or slightly less unhappy, realistically), but probably not solve their problem. Actually doing your job and finding a solution is the proper way to handle that kind of situation. They probably pay you to fix shit, not to give therapy to angry idiots."
playark,ff78one,t3_es0ysc,1579643315.0,"If the clone is close enough to the original then they'd both be sad since they're the same gender. Sad gachas won't look at you, and their crystals have less. I think they have to be something like 10-15 foundations apart unless they're opposite gender."
playark,feuau21,t1_feu4srp,1579384824.0,"So it wasn't a new bug, that's good to know. Yeah, it took me forever to figure it out since it takes a while for the desync to cause problems after it happens. Glad I could help."
playark,fenh1uz,t3_epwwx2,1579284521.0,"Probably a new bug. Pay attention to what you're doing and see if there's something that causes the desync, and maybe you can avoid it. It kept happening to me while building, then I realized that I was causing it by picking up a ladder while climbing it.

But it could also be something with your internet connection. I used to disconnect constantly, despite my connection seeming rock solid for absolutely everything else, but that stopped after swapping out my router for a new one. Might be something along those lines for you. Ark's networking is kinda temperamental."
ARK,fendtwe,t3_eq0egs,1579282553.0,"If you're talking about the passage just past the crouch entrance, you can still turn around and walk out on foot. Just avoid the bears. From the water in the main chamber, follow the path up and to the right and you should see where to go. You'll need a pick to break an ice wall.

If you've already fallen down the hole past the crouch entrance, you might be able to sprint past the ice worms and hug the left wall until you get back to the fork with the hole, and at that point you can get all the way out.

If you somehow made it all the way to the area before the barrier to the queen and aren't prepared to fight her, you can still escape without fighting. Drop down, initiate the fight, then run back into the water and wait a few minutes for her to despawn."
menkampf,felv04m,t1_felbd75,1579231611.0,"I'm not even going to begin to argue against that, because your fundamental premise and the terms you use are wrong. Individualism is diametrically opposed to identity politics, and any ideology based in collectivism. Individualism is not selfishness, nor does it oppose any sense of community attachment.

You might have a coherent point about living for something greater than one's self and the strength of a unified society, but you still aren't using the right terms to make it."
menkampf,fel8sg4,t1_fekyqzx,1579216540.0,"I'm genuinely impressed by this comment. I haven't seen anything so completely, utterly, objectively wrong like that in quite some time."
ARK,fekjude,t3_epg7ud,1579201554.0,"Unless they broke them recently, they definitely still spawn on Xbox servers. I found four during the WW event.

They spawn across almost the entire map, so it's mostly a matter of luck finding one. They won't be all the way out to the edges, but I've seen them all over. Don't think I've ever seen one around the center of the map though. Just make sure you're flying around about as high as the top of the rocks in the central canyon.

There's a glitch that helps you find them, where if you're the first person in render where the phoenix was at the end of the last heatwave, you'll see it turn to ash but then stay visible on the ground until you leave render. So you aren't completely limited to heatwaves for locating them. Helps if you're on a low-population server."
ARK,fehlnjf,t3_ep38pg,1579119057.0,"This was how I rolled back when I first played on Rag. My feathery death swarm ruled the scar and annihilated gigas, and it was GLORIOUS!"
ARK,fehkhh7,t3_ep4fuh,1579118383.0,"Not sure why you didn't fly your wyvern all the way down to the invisible barrier before the crouch entrance, since you could have skipped all the bears. You can also just sprint past all the worms until you get to a drop. You don't really need to fight them all.

I always take the left passage at the fork so I don't have to backtrack for that loot crate. It's probably slightly faster if you're sprinting past everything anyway.

For the queen, a rex works way better than a thyla. You have to pod/unpod to get past the barrier anyway, and a good boss rex will kill the queen in seconds. It'll fit through the passage all the way to the exit. Or you can use a giga for the fight, but you'll have to walk out on foot."
sbubby,fehdqm4,t1_feh6fbb,1579114446.0,"But they still likely have celery juice or something else that naturally contains a shitload of nitrates, so it's not any healthier in the slightest."

playark,fdrjy5p,t1_fdq8xfd,1578685607.0,"On a similar note, you can grapple the cave snails on Scorched and take them out and tame them. If you've got the cakes you can get ones that tame out to level 300+.

You can also pick up small wild dinos with the argy's tertiary grab attack, in PvE."
playark,fdrit7r,t1_fdqv7se,1578685146.0,You can also do that on Xbox if you plug in a USB keyboard.

playark,fdhay9a,t1_fd7ukwx,1578419122.0,"When you throw out a 451 or higher dino it doesn't show any messages. It does the normal animation and nothing appears. It's definitely not the same, and the cryopod doesn't get deleted too."
playark,fdha9gy,t3_el26g4,1578418750.0,"They don't hand slap ever in my experiences. Is there some trick to that? I have to drop mistletoe at its feet, then I can put in two coal one at a time and get two crystals. Sometimes just one.

I'm on Xbox PvE official."
NobodyAsked,fd3y7oi,t1_fd3tuxo,1578162674.0,"The relevant point is that actual extremists feel like they're in good company when people espouse their views ironically or as a joke. Strawman at the end aside, it's making the exact same point that you are in its first few panels.

I should have specified or just linked to a couple relevant panels."
Jordan_Peterson_Memes,fd3onlp,t3_ejuliq,1578160343.0,I thought that too. It didn't matter.

ARK,fczekni,t1_fczd81s,1578099436.0,"It only applies to ice wyverns on Valguero, and only if the icon shows as blank or a raptor. Not all of the ones I've hatched had the problem, and fire wyverns were never affected. After they're fixed they should be able to transfer normal by any means.

AFAIK, rock elementals tamed on Valguero have always had the glitch where they can't be uploaded and can't be deployed from a cryopod if transferred. Nothing can fix them."

ARK,fcyv8pd,t1_fcy7ujx,1578087817.0,"Technically, it is safe to level dinos up to 450. They only get deleted at 451. But they realistically won't benefit much from a single level and you might as well keep them safe by keeping a little margin.

You would benefit from breeding in lower oxygen and other stats. Ideally you should be able to get your rexes down around level 380 and not sacrifice too much."
ARK,fcyrv8n,t3_ejdis7,1578085756.0,"Protip: If a pego ever jumps you and you see the message that it stole your empty cryopod, don't assume that it actually stole an empty one. It will say that if it steals a pod with a dino, but the game lies to you. Don't ever think that you only lost an extra pod you didn't need and cut your losses, because it might be running off with your giga."
ARK,fcyqnwv,t1_fcyb5r9,1578085093.0,"When the server goes down for an update, or it crashes and rolls back to the last save. You might have to wait a while 

I know the ice wyverns need to be sitting out unpodded when it resets for them to get fixed. Happened to several of mine, the ones that were out during the reset started showing the normal icon after I podded them, but the ones in my cryofridge stayed raptors.

Not sure about eggs though. They might get fixed while in a fridge, haven't confirmed for sure."

ARK,fcv0fab,t1_fctt04w,1577992115.0,"Grapple fishing for a body in lava is one of the most nerve-racking things ever. You've got a timer counting down before it despawns, and every miss can pull you in if you're not careful, all while your supply of hooks slowly dwindles.

It's the same principle as crafting things in your inventory, where if you're close to being black boxed then the game doesn't let you attempt to craft anything. I can't remember the exact number, but you need somewhere around 3 slots free. You definitely can't with just one. So if there's nothing more you can take out, then that blueprint is simply uncraftable.

It really ought to work, so this behavior is probably a bug."
