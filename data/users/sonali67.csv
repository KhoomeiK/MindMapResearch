Australia is massive and a large portion of it is bushland (the bush is the size of several European countries) so there is still more land at risk of burning.

AskDocs,ffrgvf6,t1_ffpu108,1580157796.0,Thanks for sharing how it makes you feel. Very understandable - we do need to be thoughtful about the words we use and what they normally mean (outside of how they are commonly used in medicine) and how that makes people feel.
AskDocs,ffrgacs,t1_ffoqw6d,1580157484.0,"There is no evidence it works in studies, so were I live we would never do this if you have only AS. Some people in AS also have inflammation in joints outside of their spine and methotrexate can help for that but not for the actual AS part.

AskDocs,ffrg1ac,t1_ffpgh83,1580157350.0,That means your rheumatologist didn't apply via the AS pathway but used one of the other arthritis pathways to apply to the TGA (either Psoriatic Arthritis or Rheumatoid Arthritis).  The AS pathway only requires you trial NSAIDs + excercise because they would never require trialling leflunomide or methotrexate for AS ([check out the application form here here](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/organisations/health-professionals/forms/pb073)). If you have AS it's possible you AS didn't meet the AS application criteria but you arthritis in other joint did.
AskDocs,ffrf8bh,t1_ffpns4m,1580156888.0,"That use depends on the country you are in. In a lot of countries remicade is rarely used for AS these days because we have had subcutaneous options for a long time. Remicade can only be given as an IV infusion (a drip), whereas the other biologic medications for AS (even the ones that are the same type/target) are in a pen a person can inject themselves. These are better lifestyle wise for people, generally cause less reactions than remicade and less infection risk than an infusion. Hence you wouldn't ever need to give an AS patient methotrexate because it doesn't work for AS."
AskDocs,ffnqmsb,t1_ffna4t8,1580069440.0,"Actually we don't use methotrexate for AS, we start with NSAIDs then straight to biologics if needed (no proven efficacy of conventional synthetic DMARDs in AS). Just clarifying as OP may be looking up the medications posted in the comments."

AskReddit,fdiwmg7,t3_elgpmo,1578452703.0,"I'm a doctor (in Australia but have also lived in multiple ther countries) and I can see a lot of misunderstanding in the comments about what a ""yearly medical"" is or what a ""mental health check"" up would involve.  

Firstly I think it's important to to understand that not all check ups are the same - there is no standard or agreed upon list of things a doctor would do in a yearly check up so what each doctor does is different.  Usually a yearly check up is a mix of screening and preventative health. There are some things that have good study evidence to show they prevent future illness (for example blood pressure/cholesterol checks and some cancer screening for the right people/age groups). Though there are also other tests that some doctors may include in a ""check up"" that have no evidence that if the tests were positive, following up on them would prevent future illness - these may just lead to more unnecessary tests.  So you can't make general statements on whether yearly checkups are a good or bad thing - it's about whether the individual tests or assessments and what is done to follow them up is of benefit.  When it comes to mental health check ups it's the same principal.  Whatever is being done in the check up to screen for or detect mental health issues as well as how that's followed up needs to be appropriate (including costs to the patients) and effective in preventing issues.  If mental health check ups were done well it would be great to improve mental health but if you were going to be serious about doing them for everyone and having a positive impact you need a good evidence based system.  Otherwise it could just mean unessessary and potentially expensive further appointments, tests and treatments. I don't work in mental health so I'm not sure what research has been done in this area so far. Though I think if you live in a place where affordable healthcare access is a major issue for most people (e.g. america, most of asia) there are a lot of basic healthcare access issues that should be improved before you would consider mental health check ups for all."
