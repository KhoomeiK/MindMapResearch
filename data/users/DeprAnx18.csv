philosophy,fffkkxu,t3_esxayb,1579885977.0,"This actually makes me think of Hume. In the Treatise while talking about what he calls ìGeneral Rulesî of our judgement, he gives an example of someone locked in a cage, and that cage is hanging from a tower. Despite her better judgement of the impressions of solidity of the cage, the impressions of depth and height and falling she is accustomed to still cause her to be afraid. 

I also think of Kierkegaard and the idea that the reason one is afraid of standing on one leg on a skyscraper for an hour isnít that theyíre afraid theyíll fall but afraid theyíll jump. 

I think both of those ideas are relevant to the Sublime. I think the Sublime is in some way a clash of the General Rules of our judgement. When our judgement is sent off in such wildly different directions that we ìdonít know what to thinkî in the face of such a sight, like Niagara Falls for example, and it is only after the fact in hindsight that we can dissect what happened, and say we must have judged it both beautiful and terrifying, and these feelings must constitute the sublime. The sublime when we experience it is fragmented judgement; the sublime as we analyze it is a judgement of our judgements."
philosophy,ffcb2pe,t3_erxhqb,1579795590.0,"Thereís a chair in front of me. The chair that I think is in front of me is not actually the chair that is in front of me. 

He starts with this example, after saying that his work is being taken out of context by ìin short, wooly philosophyî. He also claims that philosophers wants science to ìkeep its hands off my consciousness mysteryî. Me thinks he protest too much. 

What exactly is it heís trying to claim by saying the chair I think I see in front of me isnít really what I think it is? That may weíll be the case, but then does what ìI think the chair isî matter anymore? There is no indication from the author that my perceptions are irrelevant, but I think this certainly ought to be addressed because I think itís an easy inference to make based on what is written.  

If this is a way of saying, from within neuroscience discourse, that no one personís bodily perceptions can provide an acontextual, objective view of the world, then I totally agree. 

If the argument is that science can provide us with a picture of consciousness and the world that is more ìobjectivelyî ìcorrectî than the world of our perceptions, I vehemently disagree and find the level of scientism here frightful. 

It doesnít matter to me what science says about how correct my perceptions are. Based on observation alone, I say I perceive things. I would even say that perception is a prerequisite of observation. Even if my perceptions are different from that which Iím perceiving (they are, which I know from having perceived other people in social interactions, and finding a mismatch between their intent and my perception of it), a complete scientific picture of consciousness still ought to be able to account for the fact that I perceive something. 

An account of consciousness that ignores our subjective experience of perception would be like painting an incredibly vibrant, detailed mural of the most boring office space in the world."

AskFeminists,feyughn,t1_feyqfri,1579450667.0,"What about just ìfeministî instead of ìmale feministî or ìallyî? Is there something about the term that excludes cis men from identifying with it? 

Iím only 23 so my life experience is negligible, but I remember being younger and feeling that feminist was a dirty word, and definitely not applicable to men. As Iíve grown and reflected, I realized that thinking that ìfeministî is a dirty word is kind of a toxic idea in itself. The way Iíve tried to combat this within and outside of my own mind is by calling myself a feminist. If I call myself an ally, I feel like I support the same things as feminism, but by not identifying with the term itself Iím reminded of the feelings of feminism being a dirty word and not something for men. 

I wish I didnít have to identify that way at all, feminism should be the default. I wish we lived in a world where it was only noteworthy when someone wasnít a feminist, and I feel like calling myself a feminist is one of the contributions I can make to that effort in my lifetime."

Iíve been afraid to since I was young and I would cry at school and that made it hard to fit in which is something I struggled a lot with back then. I chose to say ìmenî, because I think men in particular are shamed by our culture for crying, or at least, I got the impression it was a shameful thing to cry as a boy. So I said men because I want to live in a world where openly crying and healthily expressing emotion is associated with masculinity, and I want men to feel safer to express themselves. At the same time, I want everyone to feel safe to cry and express their emotions, and I didnít mean to leave anyone out with what I said."

DarK,feneite,t1_fendf5i,1579282975.0,"It almost seems like a ìloopî is intensely a matter of the perspective one occupies ìwithinî it.

philosophy,fence2t,t3_eo8chq,1579281678.0,"Anyone else seen the Netflix original ìDarkî out of Germany? There are implicit and explicit philosophical ideas throughout and to anyone who hasnít seen or heard of it I highly recommend checking it out. 

To anyone who has seen it, what sort of philosophical themes have you picked up while watching? 

IIRC there are multiple explicit references to Nietzsche. Iíve been looking at Heidegger lately, and I have to think that Being and Time is making its influence felt in some way in the show, though I wonder (and suspect Iím at least partly correct) about how difficult it would be to grapple with someone like Heidegger as a German, if the controversy he invokes stateside is any indication."
DarK,fenblqz,t3_eq1aqz,1579281195.0,"I wonder if it will even matter in the end. Like, they keep talking about a loop, and a cycle. Why should we think this is anything more than a different way of talking about the life we all live? 

If the loop is, was, or ever will be broken, how was this not a part of the loop in the first place? One of the themes Iíve understood the show to be trying to convey is that nothing can happen in any of the years we witness that wonít effect the others. 

This means that if the loop is/was/will be broken at any point, from the perspective of ìoutside the loopî, the loop already has been broken, and we are already seeing those effects. But wouldnít that make this in fact a continuation of the loop, rather than a breaking of it? Precisely. There is no difference between if the loop breaks or it doesnít. The events play out the same regardless, for no other reason than thatís the way they happen to play out, based on the choices each character makes with the information and experiences available to them at the time."

I donít meant to attack you (though I was a bit put off by what seemed to me to be an unnecessarily critical comment), but I think in general we ought to be more critical of the authority we grant a text simply on the basis of it being published.

The thing is I donít think it would take a large number of women (or men) who hate men calling themselves feminists in order for people tweeting #notallmen to come to that misunderstanding. I think that stereotype (like all stereotypes) is born out of a lack of nuance and willingness to reflect. Perhaps that lack of willingness, for many men (or women) comes from fear of (white) patriarchal power structures losing societal control. Maybe that can be more directly addressed in discourse as a remedy to reiterating the problems with #notallmen ad nauseam.

changemyview,fcngxu7,t3_ehvu8x,1577811481.0,">More recently I've started realising that without minds to conceptualise the world, the universe really is just atoms and energy. A chair is only a chair because we say it is, else it's just a collection of atoms. And even the act of conceptualisation can be broken down into electricity reacting with atoms.

I've had this realization myself. But let's take it a step further. How is it we know the universe really is just atoms and energy? I'm not saying this invalidates that claim, but I believe the answer is still **minds**. Without minds to conceptualize the world, there wouldn't be a world to conceptualize. Our senses didn't evolve to present us with impressions of the world ""*in itself*"", our senses evolved based on what helped us survive. This means that our perceptions of the world, while completely valid, are uniquely *human* perceptions. A chair is only a chair because we say it is. But by the same token, the universe is only atoms and energy *because we say it is*. This doesn't make it wrong or invalid. Based on the *way we say* gravity and friction and aerodynamics work, we keep planes in the sky. The act of conceptualization can be broken down into electricity reacting with atoms, but so too can electricity and atoms be broken down into conceptualization. Without (human) minds to conceptualize the world, if we may take some imaginative liberties, the world would simply go on, whatever that means. The thing is, in our human lives, we grow up learning to talk and think about the world in particular ways. We literally couldn't imagine what the world would be like without thinking and talking in those ways, because those are quite literally the only tools we have for that job since birth. So what if thats the way science talks about you petting your cat, thats just a way of talking about it, and an unhelpful one at that. Your cat has a mind too, and probably a mind that is 100% unaware of the physics of the universe. I don't mean this to be a dick at all, I actually mean it very positively, but try thinking of humans as less significant. I think we all learn to think too highly of ourselves as humans. I think human value is lowered by introducing it to the messy world of human values.

I also highly recommend the 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume. He talks about dealing with this skeptical crises himself. He says that no matter how intense his skeptical crisis, when he returns to his game of backgammon it's still a game of backgammon. That nagging existential crisis will persist and come up in your life every now and again. Its a reminder to get out of your study and surround yourself with people you enjoy; they need to escape from that existential dread just as much as you.

No legitimate feminist, as I understand it, would ever claim that ìall menî are responsible for anything, itís reductive and unhelpful.

He starts with this example, after saying that his work is being taken out of context by ‚Äúin short, wooly philosophy‚Äù. He also claims that philosophers wants science to ‚Äúkeep its hands off my consciousness mystery‚Äù. Me thinks he protest too much. 

What exactly is it he‚Äôs trying to claim by saying the chair I think I see in front of me isn‚Äôt really what I think it is?

If this is a way of saying, from within neuroscience discourse, that no one person‚Äôs bodily perceptions can provide an acontextual, objective view of the world, then I totally agree. 

If the argument is that science can provide us with a picture of consciousness and the world that is more ‚Äúobjectively‚Äù ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù than the world of our perceptions, I vehemently disagree and find the level of scientism here frightful. 

It doesn‚Äôt matter to me what science says about how correct my perceptions are. Based on observation alone, I say I perceive things. I would even say that perception is a prerequisite of observation. Even if my perceptions are different from that which I‚Äôm perceiving (they are, which I know from having perceived other people in social interactions, and finding a mismatch between their intent and my perception of it), a complete scientific picture of consciousness still ought to be able to account for the fact that I perceive something.

The thing is I don‚Äôt think it would take a large number of women (or men) who hate men calling themselves feminists in order for people tweeting #notallmen to come to that misunderstanding. I think that stereotype (like all stereotypes) is born out of a lack of nuance and willingness to reflect. Perhaps that lack of willingness, for many men (or women) comes from fear of (white) patriarchal power structures losing societal control. Maybe that can be more directly addressed in discourse as a remedy to reiterating the problems with #notallmen ad nauseam.

AskFeminists,fcnmm81,t1_fcnk20x,1577814372.0,"Sorry if I didn't articulate myself quite right, I don't at all mean to say that the view points feminism advocates aren't (constantly, and exhaustingly) met with that response, but I think that response stems from a misunderstanding of feminist view points, in part because of people who call themselves feminists but really just hate men. Facebook and Twitter I think are really at fault here. If you're already following content that is remotely right of center politically social media algorithms are, I would think, much more likely to show you content that misrepresents feminism. 

I'm sorry if I've presented myself poorly here, I'm not trying to be a dick.

changemyview,fcngxu7,t3_ehvu8x,1577811481.0,">More recently I've started realising that without minds to conceptualise the world, the universe really is just atoms and energy. A chair is only a chair because we say it is, else it's just a collection of atoms. And even the act of conceptualisation can be broken down into electricity reacting with atoms.

I've had this realization myself. But let's take it a step further. How is it we know the universe really is just atoms and energy? I'm not saying this invalidates that claim, but I believe the answer is still **minds**. Without minds to conceptualize the world, there wouldn't be a world to conceptualize. Our senses didn't evolve to present us with impressions of the world ""*in itself*"", our senses evolved based on what helped us survive. This means that our perceptions of the world, while completely valid, are uniquely *human* perceptions. A chair is only a chair because we say it is. But by the same token, the universe is only atoms and energy *because we say it is*. This doesn't make it wrong or invalid. Based on the *way we say* gravity and friction and aerodynamics work, we keep planes in the sky. The act of conceptualization can be broken down into electricity reacting with atoms, but so too can electricity and atoms be broken down into conceptualization. Without (human) minds to conceptualize the world, if we may take some imaginative liberties, the world would simply go on, whatever that means. The thing is, in our human lives, we grow up learning to talk and think about the world in particular ways. We literally couldn't imagine what the world would be like without thinking and talking in those ways, because those are quite literally the only tools we have for that job since birth. So what if thats the way science talks about you petting your cat, thats just a way of talking about it, and an unhelpful one at that. Your cat has a mind too, and probably a mind that is 100% unaware of the physics of the universe. I don't mean this to be a dick at all, I actually mean it very positively, but try thinking of humans as less significant. I think we all learn to think too highly of ourselves as humans. I think human value is lowered by introducing it to the messy world of human values. 

&#x200B;

I also highly recommend the 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume. He talks about dealing with this skeptical crises himself. He says that no matter how intense his skeptical crisis, when he returns to his game of backgammon it's still a game of backgammon. That nagging existential crisis will persist and come up in your life every now and again. Its a reminder to get out of your study and surround yourself with people you enjoy; they need to escape from that existential dread just as much as you. I think thats what friends are for, and I think thats beautiful."

No legitimate feminist, as I understand it, would ever claim that ‚Äúall men‚Äù are responsible for anything, it‚Äôs reductive and unhelpful.
