hockeyjerseys,ffec56c,t1_ffec4ai,1579842749.0,yes
hockeyjerseys,ffeaqc8,t1_ffe6iyt,1579841476.0,"if i knew where it was, i’d find the comment that someone made that displays the stages of jersey releases. admitting they’re growing on you is towards the end. soon enough you’ll be buying one :p"
hockey,ffea1fw,t1_ffe9zct,1579840872.0,i just prefer a 5v5 60m game over the entire tournament tbh
hockey,ffe8q1v,t3_et55jq,1579839772.0,"personally, i enjoy the 3v3 OVERTIME, but i don’t wanna watch a full game of it. i like the old format with the draft. east v west or team v team. i don’t like the tournament where not everyone plays the full night. and the draft was the best thing ever for sure"

rangers,ff89u3n,t1_ff88x4p,1579670289.0,yea that makes sense. i was just taking a shot
rangers,ff87hws,t3_es6v2g,1579668205.0,"he’s probably sent there by the team to increase trade value. he’s playing great hockey, and now that he’s an “all star”, that might increase his value. we all know damn well that Mika deserves to go. but we all know he’s an all star..."
rangers,ff86crp,t1_ff84mw5,1579667242.0,makes sense to me
rangers,ff70ch2,t3_eryfei,1579638582.0,"i imagine that means 

1) he’s staying a ranger and not getting sent down anytime soon

2) georgie is getting traded, duh, and he needs to be on the roster for us to have 2 goalies"

rangers,fet244x,t1_fet0nri,1579371110.0,dairy queen said he’s good to go so there’s probably nothing to worry about for you in terms of attending the game. he might sit out at some point in the near future if it continues to nag him

rangers,felqoz0,t3_eptouk,1579228605.0,i’m shocked he returned to the game tbh
hockeyjerseys,feljjtb,t1_feljdzw,1579223707.0,it’s likely a fashion jersey. i couldn’t find one on ebay - so you might be able to get a pretty penny on it if you desire to sell it at some point. the jersey doesn’t look crap to be a fake. it DOES look like the OG jets influenced the design by a lot tho lol
hockeyjerseys,felj1nj,t1_feliz93,1579223359.0,could be a fake or fashion jersey. did the seller have any background on it?
hockeyjerseys,felir4b,t1_felg33l,1579223156.0,likely some sort of fashion jersey. at no point in their history did they wear that. the only time they wore their crest was in the 70’s. any idea when/where you got this?
hockeyjerseys,felioce,t3_epssoh,1579223102.0,goddammit if i wasn’t on a budget i’d buy some. my size and everything

hockeyjerseys,fe6lrn1,t3_enjcip,1578895185.0,"i’m a ranger fan and i always said that the only islander jersey i’d ever get is a fisherman jersey - without spending too much money. i ended up finding one on here for $125. small prick of a hole somewhere and a tiny black dot. wore it once to flex on people. otherwise it stays in the collection for collection purposes. i did let my friend wear it for a game we went to, him being the islander fan. 

i also own a devils jersey that i bought for like $50 i think when fanatics was getting rid of reebok stock. i wear it occasionally, but now with Kakko v Hughes, i don’t think it’ll be worn for quite some time..."
