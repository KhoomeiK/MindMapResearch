Embroidery,ff29ij4,t3_er2na2,1579497805.0,"It's a striking piece! Embroidery doesn't have to be all flowers and baby Yoda's (not that there is anything wrong with that). It's a subject matter which society has alot of improving to do.

I think you did it really well and I hope working on this helped you with your mania. My mother's friend is often hospitalised because of her severe mania.

I hope you're okay. I'm glad to find another person who uses embroidery to help with their mental health."
Embroidery,feb9jh9,t3_ens677,1578956606.0,Doberman? Always a fan of dog embroidery. I'm working on my first at the moment. Thanks for sharing and making me smile.
Embroidery,fea053n,t1_fe8c5jj,1578943037.0,It will have a lovely history to it if you do!
Embroidery,fe3f18c,t1_fe3cv7w,1578848720.0,"I was going to suggest reeds or grasses along the sides like there is a channel through them.

You could do a jetty or something as well?"
Embroidery,fe33ykq,t3_enmgn4,1578845691.0,I think it's just very very difficult and involves getting the stitch tension just right and using the right size needle and thread for the gauge of the holes.
Embroidery,fe32zwo,t1_fe2poe4,1578845426.0,"I think it was because it used to be on handkerchiefs and clothing and so it could be seen.

Now it's more to save thread and tidiness I think. You might notice posts where people have ""carried over"" the thread from one area to another on the back with light material it can show through the front which isn't what you want."

HumansBeingBros,fdlsl3b,t1_fdlhasw,1578531503.0,"Nooooo.

I remember the ones with the female. And I remember the first one where he was ""back"" and the speech he made. Not cool.

I like the podcast though. :("
Embroidery,fdjorvj,t3_elqyi0,1578481290.0,"The minimum you need is an embroidery hoop, embroidery needles, embroidery thread and material. That is enough to start practicing stitches and such. It's a good idea to get embroidery scissors as well.

You could buy a kit to try out first which usually has everything except the scissors."
Embroidery,fdfavp6,t3_ek7a6f,1578357374.0,That is such a generous offer. I hope whoever you give this to will share their work here when it's done.
Embroidery,fde3f1i,t3_ekm9vn,1578330306.0,This is great! I would be thrilled if I could create a dog face that good.
velvethippos,fde2jy2,t3_ekkc3u,1578329745.0,His face is sooo smooshable. Please give him kisses from me if he likes kisses
HumansBeingBros,fd0d4xz,t1_fd02l4e,1578117131.0,"In general they're not. They're in shock, dehydrated, hungry and likely burnt or suffering smoke inhalation. They are probably also exhausted from the adrenaline from the nightmare of their home turning into an inferno."
velvethippos,fcxwjxg,t3_ejfqvw,1578071492.0,He's very handsome. Sorry to hear about the rarepupper hate. I have a staffie so I understand how it can make you feel.
worldnews,fcxurgi,t1_fcx7bkb,1578070703.0,You shouldn't feel bad for the PM. The guy said he didn't want to shake his hand and the PM then proceeded to if ore him and try anyway.
worldnews,fcxu3wa,t1_fcxat7q,1578070516.0,Yup. Think people need to start having their arms crossed or hands in their pockets so he can't grab them to force a handshake. That guy must have been livid when he grabbed his hand anyway.
Embroidery,fcxp9sc,t3_ejc9t4,1578068278.0,Welcome! That's basically what happened to me as well. I'm working on my first piece.
TwoXChromosomes,fcvq4lr,t1_fcvikku,1578007574.0,*pasta. It's a type of pasta. One of the types of which is a tube shape.
velvethippos,fcvk4xr,t1_fcuplpt,1578003814.0,"I hope you don't mind me using this phrase. It exactly describes what my dog does to get his body under my leg when I sit on the edge of the sofa.

A phrase I like to use to ask someone to move forward or get the dog to keep walking is ""scoot your boot""."
velvethippos,fcujnqe,t1_fcug7sh,1577982523.0,"I love everything about this but especially the phrase ""root his snoot""."
velvethippos,fcujcn5,t1_fcu7nzw,1577982318.0,I definitely got a new blanket with the intention of it being our Staffie's blanket. It's our blanket really though. It has penguins on.
aww,fcqljvl,t1_fcqkud7,1577888146.0,"Oh, no. On days we know there will be fireworks I take him for a longer walk during the day, then give him dinner whilst it's still light and then have to wait to give him his meds (at least 30/60 minutes). Then hours later the fireworks start. I wouldn't be able to get him to go for a walk when fireworks are going off or risk it in case he managed to get off his lead and run off in fright."
aww,fcqjblr,t1_fcqhe8d,1577887011.0,"It's always difficult. Our dog is three and a half and didn't care about fireworks at all until this past bonfire night when he became terrified. We were home because that's how we roll but we could have just has easily not been because of his track record. He now gets preventative care including extra long walks to tire him out, early dinner before dark when it all starts and medication. Then it's onto the sofa and under his blanket which really needs a wash but I leave it so it has his scent all over."
aww,fcqhs6a,t1_fcq4m83,1577886232.0,"Rescue animals aren't free, most places you pay a fee to help cover the costs of the animals care and stay."
aww,fcqh677,t1_fcq1h1w,1577885917.0,"Varies from animal to animal and situation to situation. Our dog is one that generally does better being ignored when he gets upset as he calms down when he sees us behaving normally. With fireworks, not the case. We tire him out with a looooooong early walk and early dinner then he hangs out on the sofa with us under his blanket and gets medication before it all kicks off."
aww,fcqgkmm,t1_fcqf2am,1577885599.0,"Not necessarily. Some dogs aren't bothered by fireworks for various reasons. Some are deaf. Some are used to loud sudden noises. Some sleep through it.

No doubt that some dogs that are left alone on NYE shouldn't be but blanket statements like this are over the top.

Also, my husband and I spent last night hanging out with our dog making sure he was okay as he doesn't like fireworks. So much so that he has to be medicated. Not all dogs are the same."
pics,fcqfn81,t3_eif8ei,1577885100.0,Your Dad is brilliant and incredibly brave. The fact he's a volunteer all the moreso. I don't know enough about Australia and it's firefighters set up to really know what I'm talking about but I hope he and all the others who have stepped up are cared for both financially and in any other way needed as a result of the extended period of time they are putting in to save lives.
Embroidery,fcakvtu,t3_egrh9s,1577571214.0,"I asked for an LED clip on light for Christmas because I tend to get around to wanting to do embroidery once the best daylight has gone. The only reason I didn't ask for one with a magnifier is because I don't want to get used to using one before I might need one either due to doing tiny details or eyesight.

You do you. Pleased to see you got one. Doesn't matter what anyone else thinks, you get to make embroidery without annoyance, eye strain and mistakes you may have otherwise not seen until later."
Embroidery,fcak8jg,t3_egsfd5,1577570823.0,"How considerate of them to allow you one blue and green as well, haha"
Embroidery,fcak0wx,t3_egtt6s,1577570696.0,Those spaniel ears are brilliantly detailed! What a great piece of embroidery work.
mildlyinteresting,fc4bq3n,t1_fc4b4h1,1577412067.0,Natural history is intriguing and some people collect taxidermy/bones etc of animals or dried flowers and seed pods and such. Nature is awesome and thanks to past collectors there are still existing examples of extinct animals.
