The problem is not the bad guy himself, it's the system that allows a law enforcer to get away with breaking the laws that WE have to follow or else be penalized for it. Anyone involved that allows the cultivation of corruption are not being held accountable for their action. It is tiresome and disgusting."

AskReddit,fdjj6j2,t1_fdiu97h,1578473272.0,"Not me, but my aunt and my cousins. A litte bit of background about our family. We are catholic Italian Americans with very strong Italian catholic identity, not so much on my family,  but very strong with my aunt  and uncle. My cousins are in their 30's now. All their lives, my aunt have been so controlling over them. The first cousin, Mike, is a successful doctor and married with three kids, The second cousin, Robert, is barely getting by, but happy with his wife and two kids. The last, Anna is damaged good, mentally speaking. My aunt destroyed her. Mike is the favorite, Rob defied their authority, Anna relies on them like a helpless princess.

My aunt is so bad, she has to monitor everything and everyone. She helicopter me too, asking what am I doing, why, where we going, puts everyone down, always negative and prude. She lies and manipulates. If I have a drink there, she'll  monitor me even though i never had a history of alcoholism or being irresponsoble in any ways. When im drunk, im happy drunk. It's  awful and depressing. They are loaded with money, but so fucking cheap with everything. Aunt and uncle spend money on another house in Italy, flight tickets every year to go there to sit down and do absolutely nothing.


I finally had enough  of her bullshit last month when I came over for Rob's daughter birthday party.  I obilerated her in front of Robert's christian "" perfect"" in laws. It started with the door tonher house. It was windy that day, I did not realized I had to hold the door shut. She freaks out crying like bloody murder. Fair enough, I would over react too. Except that she would constantly stop feeding the baby grandchild, get up and frantically hold the door everytime I was near it instead of trusting me. Rob and I had to get stuffs ready for the party, so we would go in and out. I saw an opportunity to troll my aunt by standing near the door fron outside to watch  her frantically run to it and then i would walk away from the door. It was great aggrivating her.


Early on, rob's wife needed folding table from my aunt's basement. I asked my aunt about the table, she said she dont know where it.is ( bullshit, she didnt trust me). 5 minutes later my uncle got the table himself. I said to uncle  I thought he didnt know where it was. He had no answer.

After  everything  was done to set  up the party, robert wanted to have fun with the birthday girl. She loves batman, so rob and I put on the michael keaton batman mask and have fun with her. My aunt was upset, she patronized Robert, demanding that he leaves her house because he is upsetting her. I defyingly asked my aunt what is it he isndoing wrong? He just walked in, he hasnt done anything wrong. She was speechless, no words for it. ....then came up.with a lame answer that we are being stupid and not helping with the party. I had no answer for that. 


Then she monitors Anna, a 30 years old mentally broken virgin who had a short fling with a guy in Italy several years back. No relationship, nothing. Brilliant girl who is still going to school. Anyway, Robert's wife needed Anna's help. I went to get Anna, aunt monitors me, demanding why i am in the house again( there are three apartments within my aunt's  house, the party is held on the upper apartment, my aunt, uncle and anna lives in the middle apartment. First floor apartment is vacant). So aunt was helicoptering me, why am i getting Anna, that she getting dressed ( 2 in the afternoon), dont go in her bedroom ( door was opened halfway, i knocked anyway like an adult.) And coordinated with Anna to help out. She did.

A little while later I helped fed the younger  baby while uncle helps out. A lot of commotion goes on with everyone ( think home alone with all the family). Anna had something to say,  the hall monitor butts in to put Anna down, i told aunt to leave her alone and told anna to ignore her mother. Meanwhile Michael comes in with his wife and three very wild kids and the dog.  Massive commotion,  aunt ia crying about the door again, uncle is aggravated and wants to walk  out, becausw italians are great at drama.it was funny and I'm  glad my aunt ia suffering for all the years of torment on us and my mother( a story for another time). This was reveneg being fulfilled and I ensured to see throught it the day.

Party happens and Aunt is all over us helicoptering like the apache over Fallujah. I'm  the insurgent that's  going to fucking shoot it down. Every move we all make, she criticizes,  monitors. I had something to say in return. I asked anna a question and aunt has to butt in. I told aunt bluntly that i am not talking  to her, Anna is an adult,  she can answer for herself. I have Anna reassurance, she knows, but she has been afraid for so long. Rob's wife was happy I am standing up against all the bullshit  and right in front of her Christian  family too. 

Robert wanted to take some christmas decorations from my aunt's  basement. She never uses it. He needed my help. Fair enough he didnt need to do it now, but it's  not a big deal anyway. Nope, it was like pulling off a heist in this house. He got caught, i ran out with the santa statue. Aunt flips her shit while we were upstair with his wife. Aunt goes on a rant about him taking things without her permission. I pulled a Freud psychoanalysis and said right in front of his wife, that robert acts like this because he is afraid of his mother, that he is afraid to open up to her  and ask for something because every answer is always no from her. So he feels the need to hide fron them and sneak around. He said I hit it right on the mark and I'm  smart. I said no,  my balls are dropping from my pelvis cavity. His wife says he does it to.her too, and i let her know.its not his fault  nor it his wife's  fault. This is a survival mechanism he still kept to this day to deal  with my aunt. We said all this  right  in front of my aunt.

I had one cup of sweet rum. Aunt monitors me that its enough for me. Im responsible,  i know how to fucking drink. I had a second cup, the party will go for a while, my  limit is two cups. Aunt butts in, cutting off my access to the drink, I had enough, blah blah blah. Robert and I saw an opportunity to troll her, that he and I will get hammered and I'll  sleep over. Aunt flipa her shit, saying no i am not, i am not welcomed to sleep over, there's  no room. So i told aunt that four days  ago they had room for me to sleep.when they needed me to move a fucking heavy table and now they magically have no room for me? Got it.

They needed a lighter for the candle. Nobody had it. I had  a lighter in my car, ran to get it. Hind D asked me where did I get it. Insisted it's  not mine, why do I have it, it's  impossible, i dont need it, she dont believe me. She kept at it. Why why why why why. With below zero fucks given, in front of the perfecr christian in laws, I said Because i smoke marijuana. Everyone laughed, the christine in laws loves me no matter what, i am part  of their  family. They had a laugh, Robert wife's sisters love me as well. I am popular among them. They didnt care. Robert joked with his wife's  older sister saying we all though she would be the last person not smoking pot. I high five her, we had a laugh.  Aunt chopper is mortified. Her fascade is destroyed. 

Anna ia chubby now. She is eating  cakes and sweets. Aunt jumpa in, that they have a lot of sugar, stop eatinf, Anna is fat. I told Aunt to shut up and leave Anna alone. Anna is an adult, she knkws there's sugar. Stop bothering her. Theb i told Anna right in front of my aunt, that this  is her body, not her mother's.  She dont need permission, she an adult, do what you want. You want cake? Have it. Enjoy it. Dont listen to her mother. 


Overall we had a great night while aunt was miserae because that's  all she ever is, a miserable old hag. I completely  destroyed her like Black Hawk Down that night. I am not done with her. I will keep at it. I have nothing to lose. Robert's  wife was so happy i stood up 100 percent of the way through all the bullshit she has to deal with too."
