Postleftanarchism,fep8s5s,t3_eq4rcn,1579314689.0,"I will speak for myself.

1. I've heard it said before that Post-Leftists reject *moralism* but remain *ethical*. I personally go a step further and say there is a place for moralism as well -- I think of 'morality' as simply having *ethics in common*. And, Egoism is not a requirement of Post-Leftism.
2. While I sympathize with all anarchist efforts whether that be in the work place (syndicalism), or with eco-terrorism (green anarchism/primitivism), or underground markets (Agorism), or those living off the grid (squatters), etc.... while I appreciate these efforts, I retreat when they become a *movement*. I don't endorse any blueprint for an anarchist society.
3. I was drawn to Post-Left Anarchism after being thoroughly disenchanted with Anarchism as a movement and ideology. The complexities of our reality are infinitely layered and the solutions unclear, yet the general anarchist seems to favor *loyalty* over critical thinking while simultaneously displaying murderous rage for anyone who doesn't participate in their parade. Ultimately, I realized that there is a Reactionary-Left with its own ideological piety. It seems every popular anarchist media source has no qualms about labeling its opposition 'Neo-Nazis', with effectually zero substance. The draw for most new anarchists is in the opposition itself, and so that's what anarchist media sells. They won't admit it, but they've bred more opposition through their ignorant labeling than there would have been otherwise. The Anarchist Left has gone down such a rabbit hole with their overly politicized caricatures of evil that I myself eventually realized that the Anarchist movement is as much a threat to me as a 'fascist'/totalitarian movement. Not to mention, even if a true anarchist movement gained momentum, I felt it would more than likely be hijacked.
4. Intersectionality is valid, but identity politics are more an expression of the narcissism and political tribalism that has come with the social media era. My pet theory, is that social media has become our reflection of ourselves rather than actual people, causing a blinding abstraction of ourselves which distorts our perception of identity. Also, there is a crisis of rationalism which makes us vulnerable to intellectual manipulation ie university gender studies. Also I think our hormones are broken, due to a million things, but lets just say life within civilization. In any case, ever noticed that identity politicians are constantly putting out a witch-hunt for naysayers and threatening to throw them on the stake with 'Neo-Nazis'? Its like this: I am in support of all sexualities and identities until they become politicized, which is exactly what the Identity Politics movement is doing. Not to mention, they are no longer just defending themselves, but now they are on the attack for anyone who disagrees with them. Why are they doing this? **because that movement thrives on antagonism and witch hunting.** There, I said it.
5. I will answer as if you said ""How would *Post-Leftism* address..."" First of all, Post-Leftism does not offer alternatives, we offer critiques. For perspective though: even animals in the wild care for their disabled, because they have love for them. Leftists politicize caring for the disabled and then dump them in an alienating program with no real companionship or love, just white walls and plastic smiles from fake ass part-time students trying to fill out their resume for that high paying activist job so they can act humble while bathing in the admiration of their activist friends."

This is a perfect example of how people post with bias. I love to see anarcho-primitivists challenging the dogma of Leftist identity politics but do you really have to say they are weak and deserve to die? I mean, I think we can do better than that. Frankly, if 'modern society' is allowing them to survive then I would argue that said society is a force to be reckoned with and therefore, not weak, per se. 

Definitely I agree with the others saying Right and Left do no good. ""Egalitarianism"" is one of those words which does not stand alone as a philosophy. A society is healthier without hierarchy, but hierarchy is hard to define as well. I think it takes an empathetic anarchist to communicate 'egalitarianism' with action, rather than a Leftist defining egalitarianism and attempting to sociologically apply it."

Yea. Kinda sad how much we are still on the Leftist hook after all.

Personally I think this is still a worthy topic of discussion.

>capitalism merely allows for the existence of private property generally.

Key word, *generally*, which has allowed capitalism to wreak the havoc it has. 

You sound like an anarcho-capitalist, which is silliness.The origin of government is Warlords finding rural people to force taxes upon, and gangs forcing 'protection' on market folk while extracting payment. Modern governments are just 'civilized' evolutions of this, of course yes, in a context of many eras of war. Point is, in any Anarcho-capitalist society its just a matter of time before someone with enough capital pays of the security forces to protect its will and starts pulling strings. 

>SECOND, wealth concentration is in no way inherently a problem.

Yes it is, the more capital one gains, the more advantage they have to gain more capital. Stop blaming policy for capitalisms externalities. 

>LITERALLY EVERY CONFIGURATION OF SOCIETY.

Virtually any thought up version of society has the potential for exploitation. Post-Left Anarchists don't suggest blueprints for what society should look like. 

Myself, I don't compete for resources, and I treat everything with the Golden Rule as much as I can manage as an imperfect human. In a world with people with mutual symbiosis as a priority, the perfect society would bloom, it would not be forced upon anyone (or at least, this is my hope for the future, or to find such a place). 

In the mean time, I do sometimes entertain subversive alternatives such as Market Anarchism, which may be closer to your interests."
CapitalismVSocialism,fdo1a71,t1_fdnz79e,1578597042.0,"First off, I started by challenging your claim that capitalism is not exploitative. I mentioned nothing of Marx (though I would say it seems that Marx made a thorough exposition of capitalist exploitation). 

> I would say no, that isn't a legitimate ownership claim and it shouldn't be respected.

But under capitalism one may not respect such an ownership, but it is still owned and protected by law. And, again, as we see in the long run of capitalism which is now not only in theory but by now is observable, wealth continues to concentrate into the hands of fewer and fewer and in multinational corporations which own resources all over the world. 

>It's not forced participation to simply recognize property rights. You could make the case that any system is forced participation because no matter what you live in the country you're born into and you didn't sign a waiver for being born into that system.

Just because feudalism, communism, socialism, capitalism etc. are all exploitative doesn't make it a mute point. They are each guilty of exploitation in their own way, but here we are discussing capitalism. 

I am coming from an anarchist angle, so yes, the commons are very much important in this discussion. This said, I am not advocating any system or lack of a system (I am more of a Post-Left-Anarchist), I am only discussing the exploitation within capitalist framework."
CapitalismVSocialism,fdnqpgy,t1_fdkwqm5,1578591005.0,"I've been thinking about this and I think it comes down to you having a lack of morals. 

I could try explaining to you how, if there is a village around a water way, and everyone in the village goes to collect water there, and then a capitalist comes along, buys the water way and then charges everyone in the village to collect the water they have always collected, this is exploitative. But you could make an argument to the contrary. You could say this is the greater good of 'progress', for instance. 

Independence from any exploitative relationship is part of why people came to America, searching for the American dream. If they knew that the long game of capitalism was monopolies and a class system of ownership and renting which cripples the renting class and ever continues the path of extracting profit into the hands of the owners, perhaps they would have focused energy on their revolutions at home. 

Anyway, I cut you off short in that last response because I realized that here we are still and you haven't even responded directly to my main argument:

>You are born. You, as a human, need food, water, and shelter and human connection to develop and to live (among other less tangible elements to health). Now, the water sources, buildings, food, and land, is all 'owned' (privately or publicly) and rights to this 'ownership' are protected by government force, thus there is a state of scarcity for resources defined by the law. You may acquire these resources only through participation in a system of economy, ie a middle man between you and the resources you require, on which you are taxed by the government, and if you do not inherit said required resources, you are forced to rent from the existing owners until you acquire them on your own through competition.

There is a state of forced participation in a competitive system to even survive. A non-competitive person will inevitably be exploited. Therefore, there is a state of exploitation under Capitalism. Period."

CapitalismVSocialism,fdklucr,t1_fdkiod5,1578506230.0,"First off I am not making the claim that capitalism is slavery, I just wanted to establish at least one agreed upon example of exploitation existing before we entered our debate over whether capitalism is also exploitative. 

What happened hundreds of years ago is in fact relevant because it illustrates that humans can, and have lived and thrived without the middle man of money, and that said peoples were forced into 'civilized' systems. Whether rural, or tribal, there were rebellions against this. Check out anti-civilization theory. But you're right, I would not support capitalism either way. 

You can mention risk all you want but it should be obvious that a wise 'risk' is one of investing what one is willing to lose, and then waiting until profits have accumulated enough to invest again. With capital gain comes profit, risk is taken after influxes of profit. That's smart capitalism. 'Risk' is just a term capitalists use in justifications. 

You have a way of skimming through posts to find things you disagree with rather than addressing the whole argument. I could take the time to explain each issue you don't understand but then I would be wasting a lot of patience and making the mistake that Hhtura did with you. Try reading my post again.

This is not to mention the history of forcing indigenous peoples into 'civilized' systems such as capitalism. This is not to mention that capitalism is a winners game, in that the more capital one acquires, the more advantage one has in acquiring more capital (don't say 'risk'), as well as an ability to maintain that capital by profit through renting it out.

Not to mention, I find it strange that I rarely, very-very-curiously-rarely find corpses despite the immense birth and death happening constantly - but without questioning physical reality of birth and death, the empirical observation is that the crow, seagull, deer, seem to have a passed down consciousness that I can observe over all my years of life to this present day.

How does this work with humans? Perhaps infinitely more complicated, especially given our history of wiping out whole peoples, celtics, native americans, random Chinese rural regions etc. while interbreeding here and there.

Also, I tend to think that the magic of it all is distorted or destroyed when we make claims on physical reality, such as in our hyper Science oriented society."
