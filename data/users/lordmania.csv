RATS,ff8iace,t3_es0d0s,1579679745.0,Never be sorry for sharing this cuteness.
Scary,ff8i5md,t3_erzt1w,1579679568.0,I fucking love this.
iamverysmart,ff8i2nz,t3_es7qfz,1579679462.0,"More proof that an education doesn't neccesarily equate to high intelligence. One who's legitimately intelligent doesn't need to fucking brag about it constantly. Also, even people of average intelligence know what a colloquialism/slang is and that words often take on different/various meanings as time progresses. This Harvard douche isn't as smart and/or knowledgeable as he/she/they think they are."
Drag,ff8h8if,t3_erwokb,1579678385.0,Yellow is a beautiful color on you. I love this whole look.
RBI,ff8h66a,t1_ff8byij,1579678302.0,"u/BlueStoneArt is correct. My mother does forensic hand writing analysis and I've learned a lot from her over the years. This note was written deliberately to look like choppy childrens' handwriting, but definitely by an amateur. I'm betting it's an older teen or young adult trying to scare OP, but I'd still turn it in to authorities and remain vigilant to be on the safe side."

illnessfakersgonewild,fepufp7,t3_eqa3o3,1579331691.0,Fuck this. I'm trans myself and being trans is no justification for raping or assaulting anyone. This is abhorrent. Never trust a rapist.
CasualConversation,feh3jba,t3_eovfrd,1579108401.0,"I'm so happy for you that you have good friends. Similarly, I once overheard my friends saying nice things about me when they didn't know I could hear them as I stepped out to smoke a cigarette. Having good friends really makes life more bearable at times."
illnessfakersgonewild,feg66eb,t1_fefsg5z,1579078802.0,"I was diagnosed with moderate diabetic gastroparesis 8 years ago, and unfortunately it can't be cured but it absolutely can be managed to the point where there's little to no symptoms. When I was first diagnosed I was vomiting at least once every hour a day, sometimes more. Now I have fewer symptoms because I don't eat foods that trigger an episode. Severe cases of gastroesoparesis can cause the stomach to become so paralyzed that one can no longer vomit. That being said, she has multiple photos of herself out eating at diners and fast food joints. If she were at the point where her stomach was too paralyzed to even vomit, then she wouldn't be eating fast food and would definitely have a tube by now. She's probably lying, or got it mixed up with her gastric pacemaker (likely both), *but* the only thing the pacemaker really does is ease nausea, so maybe she's saying that her nausea isn't bad enough to vomit? In any case, we can't really rely on what she says because she's clearly not being honest."

iamverysmart,fcx9dfj,t3_ej8p30,1578056297.0,"You'd think someone who's ""super smart"" would realize that language changes and adapts. Also, language is used to communicate. If you can understand what someone said, then the purpose has been fulfilled."

askfuneraldirectors,fcmvhsx,t3_ei0jr3,1577794190.0,"Do you not know who GG Allin is? That's exactly how he'd want his funeral and wake. They also had to remove his tomb stone because his fans kept using it as a toilet. He wasn't exactly a great person, but is iconic in the punk subculture. You can view his death and wake photos at The Museum of Death in LA.

Edit: I'm sorry if this comment seems rude. I feel a bit bad after re-reading it. Just trying to explain that this is normal for GG Allin specifically. In any other case I wouldn't condone it."
askfuneraldirectors,fcmfc6e,t3_ehwdpx,1577773176.0,"For me, I had a small stint in crime scene cleanup after highschool and it really helped train me to compartmentalize and eventually become desensitized.

Edit: Also, I guess having a morbid fascination with the human body helped. You need to really be sure this is the career for you. You don't want to end up traumatized because you jumped the gun a bit."

AskReddit,fclg8kf,t1_fcldvqy,1577747070.0,"The copper taste is more common when the vagina is still producing extra protein and iron right after menstruation. So, even after one is done having their period, there will still be that excess production of protein and iron which gives the vagina a copper/metallic taste for a few days."
