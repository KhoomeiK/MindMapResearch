zelda,ff3m0f2,t3_erc7ho,1579543908.0,"Well, I think we have to separate two things here: Link speaking and Link being voiced. Because BotW Link *does* speak, in the form of dialog options. We have him making puns (""Let's seal the deal!""), joking around (""BOO!""), getting impatient (""Paraglider?"") and imitating other people's speech patterns (""Fixin' to buy/Lookin' to sell""). Sometimes we're not even given choices: there's only one option for the player to confirm. So Link is already expressing himself.

The issue is voicing Link. That would be a big step. It would put Link further outside the player's control, and the voice actor's performance would be heavily judged. Personally, I'm fine with it, but it would be an adjustment to hear someone give Link a spoken personality. He'd have inflection and emotion, and it wouldn't satisfy everyone. There's been plenty of criticism for Zelda's voice actors, and Link would probably get double that."

Reformed,feo6cw2,t3_eq6dkj,1579295750.0,"So I went to a small conservative Bible college (no longer in existence, sadly) and I think I can give you some thoughts.

I was raised in a Christian home, having attended a church where the Scripture was preached and studied, so I was coming from a pretty solid Christian perspective, though I graduated from public school. It's true that this little Bible college had its bubble (we students talked about it often enough), but I found the education there valuable. 

All of us had to minor in Biblical studies, so I was taking classes on theology (two semesters), various parts of the Bible, hermeneutics, stuff like that. We had yearly Bible conferences and mission conferences we were required to attend, plus chapel four times a week, and a weekly Christian service requirement (volunteering, etc). Living like that for five years really enriched me. There's no comparison: I have not experienced such in-depth and meaty discussion, such intensive discipleship, before or since. It made my worldview more whole, more cohesive, and robust. It gave me groundwork to continue growing as a Christian ever since, through some very hard times.

But my experience doesn't apply to everyone. God may call anyone to go anywhere. Perhaps he will call you to go to a state university, because you'll learn and grow best by getting your hands dirty and interacting with people of all faiths. Or maybe you would grow too comfortable if you stayed in the bubble. Both things happen! Some of us need the retreat from the world, but we must still at some point go back out and engage.

There isn't a one-size-fits-all solution here. God made us all different, and he has different paths for us to walk, different ways we give him glory. The important thing is to keep our eyes on him and do as he directs us.

I hope that helps."
