TheStaircase,ffcmph6,t1_ffckgrh,1579802728.0,Ok. Sure. (But he was super rich also btw). But if that‚Äôs the case you go stay with a relative or friend. You don‚Äôt stay in the blood soaked house that a very traumatic and life altering thing happened in.
JonBenetRamsey,feuwr44,t1_fet6olp,1579390717.0,Yes that is exactly what I think. The rigor is what threw off the plan and sent them into extra panic mode.
rupaulsdragrace,fesz1js,t1_fe7ny9w,1579370336.0,The New York street scenes were the How I Met Your Mother set as well.
JonBenetRamsey,fen4uoq,t3_eq1ahx,1579277005.0,"I agree with your theory on this. I‚Äôve thought for a long time that they had intended to get rid of the body before police came but something happened that changed their plan. I also believe they thought the police would go looking for JB and were surprised that they never left.

My top theory is that they were going to put her body in the suitcase and dispose of it but that rigor mortis had already set in by the time they were going to do it so she would not fit in there any longer so they panicked. That explains the suitcase in the basement.

However I had not put together what you pointed out about the ‚Äúkidnapper‚Äù telling the Ramseys to ‚Äúbring a big enough attach√©‚Äù which totally fits in with my theory. On your point about the specific bank notes, a good reason to include that would be so that they would have to bring a suit case big enough to fit the amount of smaller bills requested so if neighbors spotted them, they could explain that they had taken the suitcase to fit all the money. 

The ransom note, IMO, was just a cover for the actions of the Ramseys, but it doesn‚Äôt all fit together because they had some last minute complications."
audible,fehurgv,t3_ep32z0,1579124269.0,Yeaaaaaa I also went nuts today. I bought like 6 titles haha. So many things I had on my wishlist were dirt cheap! I kind of keep going back...
honeymoonplanning,feas7vr,t1_feargg6,1578951783.0,"I bet it would be! I am going to warn you, Negril is not the place for marble floors, chandeliers, and swim out pools/jacuzzis in your room. It is a bit rougher around the edges but still nice. It is completely laid back and all about the water and the sunsets. That said, I would go back a million times if I could. I thought I wanted the luxury stuff which is why we did a split stay, but I literally wanted to go home once we switched resorts because Negril was so much prettier and quieter. The sand at the iberostar literally cut my feet haha. Inferior in almost every way!"
honeymoonplanning,fear37x,t3_eo8o8o,1578951465.0,"I highly recommend something in Negril. The beaches there are unparalleled to the other areas. We did our honeymoon at Couples Swept Away (arguably the best beach in Jamaica) for the first part of our honeymoon. Then we switched to Iberostar in Montego Bay, and while it was definitely more luxe and fancy, I really hated it there. The vibe was so different/loud/party central, and the beach was garbage. I would not most likely return to Montego Bay, but I DREAM about Negril. 

I suggest either of the couples resorts in Negril or
Sandals Negril. At couples you won‚Äôt get a swim out pool but you won‚Äôt need it. The beach is EVERYTHING."
TheStaircase,feah4u3,t3_eo8jkz,1578948636.0,That was soooooo disturbing to me. I can‚Äôt imagine living in a home my parents or partner gruesomely died in much less walking over or past the blood stains every day. I could fully imagine getting PTSD from that experience. Not sure why they didn‚Äôt relocate or clean it. Michael never seemed uncomfortable about it which just adds to my suspicion of him already.
SuicideWatch,fe8dmy4,t3_ekbhf5,1578925061.0,"Hey OP, so happy to hear you are ok! üíô"
JonBenetRamsey,fe09vsf,t3_endxix,1578807204.0,Ok so today is the first time I‚Äôm hearing about the other sub being pro Ramsey. Perhaps I have just spent more time on this one and didn‚Äôt notice (but I am subbed to both). Someone called it their legal defense team sub. Is there truth to this?
rupaulsdragrace,fdzft09,t1_fdzfr1a,1578789809.0,I‚Äôm glad to hear that because I want to like it.
rupaulsdragrace,fdzcfih,t1_fdyd5mf,1578788868.0,The writing is also trying way too hard to be cute and clever. It comes off as shallow and unfunny unfortunately. Granted this is just from episode 1 so maybe it gets better?
notliketheothergirls,fdz1bu0,t1_fdz18rg,1578785697.0,That‚Äôs awesome. Thanks for sharing it!
notliketheothergirls,fdys8ga,t1_fdypwgn,1578783033.0,"HUH I didn't see that coming! The post I saw with this cartoon on facebook did NOT have that with it! And the woman who posted it did so un-ironically to an INFJ group with the intent of saying ""this is like us, right?"" ha. So it still counts in my mind."
notliketheothergirls,fdxm1a6,t1_fdxlz91,1578770466.0,If it wasn‚Äôt labeled as a book how would we simple girls know?
AskReddit,fdw8cpv,t3_en3o6k,1578756113.0,The Fountain.
TrueCrime,fdtcr9z,t1_fdswgqp,1578714910.0,I can‚Äôt stand MFM (as I said above haha) but I do think they seem very grateful and devoted to their fans.
TrueCrime,fdsmo36,t1_fdsml5t,1578705212.0,They do! I want to call him George but I can‚Äôt remember.
TrueCrime,fdry6od,t1_fdru9ln,1578691441.0,"Correct. Ben is the only one who just shows up haha. Marcus does the most, Henry is not far behind. Marcus‚Äôs outlines are so well thought out and I am sure take a ton of time in addition to the research."
TrueCrime,fdrxkgk,t1_fdruv36,1578691285.0,I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs patently untrue. They read multiple books and watch multiple docs and stuff for each topic which is pretty crazy considering how much content they put out. They do not just recite Wikipedia facts. It‚Äôs ok if you don‚Äôt like them but you can‚Äôt just discount that they do a lot of work for their pod.
TrueCrime,fdrwwaw,t3_emvgs0,1578690900.0,"I adore Last Podcast on the Left. I like that they use a lot of dark humor and are still extremely well researched IMO, especially Marcus. I can understand it not being for everyone though! I like to mix it in with my more serious content. 

However I cannot get behind thinking My Favorite Murder is not complete trash. They spend an hour to an hour and a half each episode doing fan shout outs and talking about stupid non relevant shit like pants they bought together in the 90s and then do 15 mins of basically Wikipedia level murder explanation.  I have no idea how they are rated so high on ITunes or why anyone can stand them haha so to each their own!

Edited a typo"
Headspace,fdldpcl,t1_fdl971j,1578521818.0,Hahaha I‚Äôm sure the library one is fine for most. I have pretty serious Misophonia so I can‚Äôt handle it üòÇ
Headspace,fdi7717,t3_elhf4a,1578436950.0,My two absolute favorites are Snowville and Midnight Launderette! I also light Light‚Äôs Journey when I‚Äôm in the right mood. They are all pretty great though except the ASMR one because I cannot stand ASMR.
AskReddit,fdhhk54,t1_fdhh81g,1578422787.0,"I like that one a lot too, but I find myself wanting to steal ideas so sometimes I avoid it."
AskReddit,fdhhh14,t1_fdhhb5s,1578422737.0,THANK YOU for this one! These are the kinds of things I was hoping to discover by asking.
AskReddit,fdhhbnk,t1_fdhh9mr,1578422647.0,Thank you for the first one! Never heard of that one. I‚Äôll sub :)
SuicideWatch,fdce4yz,t3_ekbhf5,1578272679.0,"Hey friend, I really hope you are ok and just not answering because you are getting help from family and recovering. We love you. Please update so we know you are ok."
JonBenetRamsey,fdapuoo,t1_fdabe07,1578248822.0,PSA: this book is available to read for free in the kindle library right now!
TrueCrime,fd4l90c,t1_fd4cigg,1578168574.0,That one was so upsetting and so LAYERED. I watched it really having no idea what I was getting into and WOW.
JonBenetRamsey,fd37hqn,t1_fd0qkn9,1578155451.0,"That‚Äôs actually very interesting because according Kolar in his book, Patsy did not want the dog they did have and was allergic I believe."
DisneyPlus,fcxlmx8,t1_fcxlc1a,1578065913.0,Yes! I want this more than anything else.
SuicideWatch,fcxk9pu,t3_ejdwpn,1578064990.0,"I read this whole story too to bottom and honestly couldn‚Äôt think of what to say, but I feel like I need to acknowledge you and your trauma. I am so sorry you‚Äôve had so much bad happen in your life. Your story sounds very painful and scary and isolating. 

I know you were passionate about speaking up on abuse and feel you can‚Äôt because of the incident with your daughter, but I still think you can. One of the best ways to heal in life is by trying to help others heal. Is it possible you could write about your story (as a book?) or create a podcast where you share your story and possibly speak with others on theirs? I think your experiences, while AWFUL, could be valuable to others. That might help put some purpose back in your life. And if you are really lucky, your daughter may one day see/hear it and reconnect with you after seeing you in this light. I can‚Äôt promise that, of course. But it is POSSIBLE."
AskVet,fcwlb4u,t1_fcwl9yd,1578028806.0,"Thank you, will look Into those!"
ExistentialSupport,fcvfnvq,t3_egemwz,1578001104.0,I am SO happy and relieved to see this update. I remembered you (commented on your original post) and decided to check back on you and see if you had made any more posts. I am so glad you did. Thank you for the update and I‚Äôm sending you all the positivity I can towards your healing.
INFJmusic,fcourt3,t3_ei9716,1577842125.0,I remember this one from back in the day when it played on The OC. I learned so ouch about music from that show.
HealthAnxiety,fcm6878,t1_fclt1xw,1577765289.0,"Ah yay! You are welcome! I hope it helps you as much as it helps me! My favorite sleep cast is called Snowville and I have no idea what happens in it because I never make it past 10 -15 mins I think (and they are all 45). 

I think the key thing is finding something relaxing and droning that gives your brain something to focus on that is not yourself and your body. It‚Äôs just enough to be pleasant while not too interesting that you want to stay awake to hear it."
honeymoonplanning,fcldwus,t3_ehsfbd,1577745553.0,"We just went on our honeymoon to negril and for many reasons I would personally recommend an all inclusive resort. I don‚Äôt think I personally would not have felt safe in an Air BnB and also the resorts in negril have the best beaches, particularly couples and sandals, and they all have security right on the beach as well which I liked."
HealthAnxiety,fckqdts,t1_fcklegs,1577730930.0,"Well, I‚Äôm a HUGE fan of headspace these days specifically for sleeping. They‚Äôve actually developed an entire section dedicated to sleeping and I love it SO SO much. They have basic meditations to help you relax and prepare your body for sleep, meditations for when you wake up in the middle of the night and need to o back to sleep, sleeping music, and then my FAVORITE thing which is a giant section of what they call ‚Äúsleep casts‚Äù. They are basically narrated stories designed to put you to sleep. They work so well for me. There are a ton of them and they change them around every day to make sure it‚Äôs not exactly the same so your mind doesn‚Äôt get used to it. They essentially just describe relaxing places haha. I know you can do a 14 day trial for free so I would highly suggest trying it out and seeing if it works for you."
Minerals,fck5vby,t3_ehmbdv,1577717463.0,Based off of the sparkly flecks inside I believe it is orange aventurine.
HealthAnxiety,fck5riq,t3_ehktyg,1577717379.0,"This used to happen to me in very high stress times. Every single night when I would be in those phases. What eventually helped me was downloading the headspace app and using the sleep meditations to get to sleep. Now, I don‚Äôt know what you get on the app for free or not because I am a yearly subscriber, but even if you don‚Äôt want to pay for anything, I‚Äôm sure there are free sleep meditations around you could use to the same effect."
honeymoonplanning,fck48x2,t3_eh7oym,1577716130.0,"Disney World al the way. There‚Äôs so much more to do there. If you want to do 7 days and still want to go to Disney Land, i would consider a second destination for the trip since as others have said, 7 days there is way too much. 

As a side note, I have been to both and I Much prefer the feel of Disney World, especially how in magic kingdom the lands are divided and you feel immersed in them whereas in Disney Land, you can see everything all the time. Not as magical to me, but it‚Äôs just an opinion."
visualsnow,fc1qioi,t3_efo5oh,1577326524.0,Absolutely. It makes it SO hard for me to fall asleep at night. Constant flashing lights.
