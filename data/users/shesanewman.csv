AskReddit,feh5b49,t1_feh57ld,1579109445.0,"The last guy I dated/liked hit me with the “I really enjoyed going out, but I don’t have time to date right now” excuse... nobody really has time to date, you make time. Those are the types of responses I generally get."
AskReddit,feh1cxa,t1_fegsp6c,1579107095.0,"I haven’t, because I don’t think I’d get an honest response."
AskReddit,fegsaeg,t1_fegs5at,1579101369.0,"Honestly - it’s with both cases. 

In situations like case A, it always makes me feel like I wasn’t good enough, therefore, why will it ever happen for me? In addition, if it’s going well between me and the other person, I never understand why they end it 

In situations like case B, I feel discouraged because maybe the person was one of the nicest people I’ve gone out with but usually there was nothing there in terms of connection, attraction or chemistry."

AskReddit,fegr58e,t1_fegr0bh,1579100590.0,"Of course not! But in case B, there’s no drive to go out again with that person & I find myself discouraged in general after dates like that."
AskReddit,fegqe8c,t1_fegq9du,1579100079.0,"Because it’s either one of two scenarios. 

A) great date, like the guy... doesn’t like me back or something happens. 

B) boring date, don’t like the guy... wants another date & I’m uninterested."
AskReddit,fegpyyd,t1_fegpvay,1579099781.0,Come from a more religious background... it’s expected of me & something I really want.
