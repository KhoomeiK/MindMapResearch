DMAcademy,fdfn8vy,t3_el0zxr,1578365616.0,I am a new DM and I have a very new player base as I started a group at my local game shop. I have a player who we will call Sam. Sam decided to play a Minotaur at told me at the start of the campaign “I’m going to do one absolutely stupid thing per session” at first I thought it was funny but after a while It got super annoying. When one of my older players came to me saying he was going to drop out because of Sam I put my foot down. I pulled him aside before the session and told him if he did anything again his character was dead. I had a pretty tough encounter coming up in a abandoned dwarves mine run by insane Warforged. Anyway he calmed down and haven’t had a problem since.
DMAcademy,fdfmsjg,t1_fdf5bf7,1578365317.0,This helped my in my session tonight. Thank you kind sir

AskReddit,fc4ipf6,t3_efz98e,1577417803.0,Imagine what we think of as “god” is just like a player in a civ management game. A player essentially. Like there are tons of gods all over the universe and ours is just the god of a primitive single planet civilization.
