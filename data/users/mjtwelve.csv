In both reality and Tak's fraudulent version of events, the problem had been explaining why a man who can't die kills himself. Tak investigated enough to know no one else could physically have blown Bancroft's head off. Bancroft wouldn't kill himself (he said), and if he did, would have destroyed his backups if he really wanted to end his existence. Short of that, there's no point deleting the local copy when there's an automatic cloud backup and restore system. But he did kill himself. So, why would you blow your stack out when you know you'll just be reset to the prior backup? 

Conclusion: there must be something you wanted to prevent being backed up.

In the missing time, Bancroft had been supposed to close a major business deal. As far as anyone knew, that was exactly what he had done. His usual practice on closing a deal was to blow off steam by engaging in socially unacceptable sexual acts with prostitutes. He sometimes went to high end Houses, sometimes to very low end sex cubicles.

In actuality, his son Isaac had used a copied sleeve to impersonate him in Japan (or more accurately, used a cloned sleeve to walk into the facility and have his stack DHFed to the Japanese facility, where his father's sleeve would be waiting for him - he didn't need a sleeve in Japan, he needed to impersonate his father at the local outgoing transmission point), and the Japanese didn't notice the difference, and Isaac was able to close the deal himself. Isaac was proud of his accomplishment, and went to the fights to celebrate, where his father (who had worked out what he did) found him and beat him. Isaac simply got to Japan early, before his father tried to close the deal. Presumably, his father started getting the legal documents for the closing and realized what had happened.

Afterwards, his father went to blow off steam at House in the Clouds, but this point, his wife had dosed him so that the next person he got sexual with was going to get murdered. Which is exactly what happened. The girl was willing to be murdered as she'd be paid handsomely and resleeved - she thought. Her employers had actually faked Catholic conscience decals to prevent her ever being resleeved or spun up to ask who had murdered her. 

Bigger picture, the blackmail scheme depended on the existing law preventing Catholic murder victims from being spun up or resleeved. Bancroft's influence was to be used to keep that law in place - he would have everything to lose if it were changed. No doubt, however, once the hooks were in that wouldn't be the last bit of blackmail.

Bancroft, for all his many (many) flaws, had something approaching a conscience... or alternatively, he refused to accept that someone could blackmail him. Either way, he realized the only way out of it was to blow his stack out before the regularly scheduled memory backup, thus wiping out his memory of everything since the previous backup. You can't blackmail someone over bad acts they don't know they've committed.

In Takashi's fabricated version of events, he didn't actually change the sequence much, he just substituted a visit to the cabins at the AI club for the Houses, resulting in a nasty memetic virus infection. To make that stick, he had an AI brothel infected with a military grade memetic weapon. If Laurens had been infected, if the virus was still in his mind when he was uploaded, his backup would be corrupted and given the UN's attitude towards mimetic weapons, they'd have quarantined the backup facility and burned it to the ground, effectively killing Bancroft. So, he had to make sure his infected mind wasn't uploaded, so he blew out his own stack. It fit the facts and made Laurens look bad enough he wouldn't want to ask too many questions, while still giving him a measure of heroic determination to survive against all odds. it was carefully crafted to play to his psyche."

DaystromInstitute,fdqzdgb,t1_fdpf45j,1578677315.0,"It should be noted that the Founders launched Changeling infant exploration probes in various directions, expecting their return to take generations by solid time reckoning. The Dominion adopts an extremely long time view in planning, and possibly as a result of their inherent disguise and deception abilities, as formidable as their direct military might is, their focus has always been on intelligence gathering and psychological manipulation and not outright use of force. When they do use force, everything about the Dominion  is lethal.

It is canon that the Dominion, therefore, has long range intelligence assets, deployed decades or centuries ago, and there is every reason to believe they would be dispersed in every direction, including the Delta Quadrant.

Even with no concrete direction to seize or study QSD technology, the infants DO have an implanted compulsion to return home at a certain point. If they were aware of QSD tech, they would likely have no choice but to then seize an equipped ship once a return is triggered. Their ability to do so, given their ability to replace any officer or crew to get aboard, cannot seriously be questioned.

It is literally only a matter of time before a QSD ship arrives in orbit around the Great Link."

On any project like Defiant, you need project managers but also subject matter experts - you want some guys who shoot at things for a living involved in designing weapons systems, deciding what the control layout looks like; you want engineers who are going to have to field service the systems involved when placing systems and laying out Jeffries tube locations; a doctor can tell you immediately that the sick berths are too close together and you won’t be able to fit a crash cart between them. A designer knows starship design, but not every detail of every speciality and the little things matter.
