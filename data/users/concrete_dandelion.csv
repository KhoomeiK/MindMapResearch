What are things that make you feel safe? The voice of a certain person, a song, a hot shower, heavy blankets? The first step to get out of this hole is recognizing it, which you did. The next step is to ground yourself. Use grounding techniques, put yourself in a situation that feels as safe as possible and find back to yourself. You can do this. It's hard, it takes time, but it's possible. 
If you practice meditation, do things to ground yourself daily and build a safe situation over time those bad phases will be rarer  shorter and less intense.
I found a schedule helpful. It gives me structure and helps me to stay busy so anxiety has less options to attack me"

IncelTears,fflmqc5,t3_eu5f9z,1580041498.0,"There are so many kinds of affection. Romantic love, protective love (like for a child or younger sibling), family love (that you can also feel for people you're not biologically related to) like for a parent, grandparent, or sibling (which often times doesn't go with equality in the relationship), sexual attraction, the love of a friend and so many more. Those different kinds can mix up to form new kinds of love (like I love my best friend as a sister and am protective of her while seeing her as equal unlike her younger sister whom I also love as a sister and am protective of but don't see as an equal as I was almost an adult when she was born and she's still a child), I love one friend as a friend and am sexually attracted to them at the same time (which doesn't make me have to have sex with them) and so on.
Fun fact is that those feelings depend on their character, the kind of relationship we have and our unique interpersonal chemistry, it never had anything to do with how they look (the friend that's like a sister to me is really hot, but I don't have any sexual interest, the man I have had the most sex with and who can turn me on within seconds is ugly)."
