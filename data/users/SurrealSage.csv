Every single homebrew game I have ever been in ends up with people disagreeing about what they understand or think the world to be. Either the DM explained something wrong or the DM had an inclination in their head that a player didn't, and so the DM has the world react differently than the player expects, or the cleric wants their god to be one way and didn't get what the DM meant when the DM conceived of the god in a totally different way, and so on and so on and so on.

dndnext,ffdqo5s,t1_ffdkm6g,1579826613.0,"Something to think about with Forgotten Realms is that the world was created at roughly -35,000 DR, and we're at 1490 DR. That means it has been 36,490 years since world creation, and we're still talking about renaissance era fantasy.

Putting this in perspective: In real life, it was 2000 years from Rome to modenr day earth. Toril has gone from Rome to modern day Earth 19 times. Yet, it is again renaissance styled fantasy. Why?

The first great empires of Faerun popped up quickly, primarily the Sarrukh. But they collapsed. They consolidated magic, grew dependent upon magic, and then the phaerimm showed up and caused havoc. The sarrukh tried to drown them out by diverting a sea, but caused a massive ecological disaster that spelled the doom of their empire.

The Jhaamdath was an empire of human psions who arose following the teachings of Jhaam, a favored of Auppenser. They created 12 ""Cities of the Sword"", powerful cities as they become an imperial expansionist power. This means they increase deforestation. The elves see this, and they use Elven High Magic to send a tidal wave from the Sea of Fallen Stars to decimate all twelve cities at once, wiping out the entire civilization and sending the survivors back to the stone age.

The Netherese is an old tale, but one worth noting. They grew powerful with magic, they made their cities float, disease and all that was managed and they were booming. Then the Netherese's hubris lead them to think they could steal the mantle of Goddess of Magic to become even more powerful to fight of the phaerimm, causing all magic to ""turn off"" and collapse the entire civilization. The three enclaves that survived went on to become the foundation of other empires, but before that, they were knocked back into obscurity.

The elves used to have tons of major empires littered throughout Faerun, but thus broke out the Crown Wars and they all began to kill one another in a massive clusterfuck that elves in modern times FR are still deeply embarrassed about and try to keep secret.

So, I think the thing to keep in mind is that while medicine does preserve life longer, magic also creates the ability for advanced civilizations to be entirely destroyed in the blink of an eye, killing massive sums of people. 

Additionally, magic also means food is more easily available, providing for greater security into old age. People don't need to have 16 kids, expecting half to die from a harsh winter/disease/etc., and hoping the other half take care of them into old age. You can go to a temple of Chauntea or something and they probably have a cleric daily going ""Yo, here's a huge feast of magical food! Praise Chauntea!"". This provides a safety net into old age, and I believe a major theory of population growth leveling out in developed countries has to do with people being able to secure themselves in their old age without the help of their younger progeny."
dndnext,ffd7a41,t1_ffd2td2,1579814802.0,This is what I do. I use 5e for mechanics and still run my games in the 1352 and on time period. I'll also go past when the spellplague would normally have occurred to write my own future for the Realms and make it far more homebrew.
dndnext,ffd72vz,t1_ffcggdk,1579814692.0,"This has been Ed Greenwood's approach and what he recommends people to do.

The setting is the stage, the story is the script. You use the setting to give the myriad little details you don't normally think of so you're not making it up on the fly and there is an understanding between the actors as to what the major props are to play with. If the script requires you to change some set pieces, do so. The actors can improvise. Alternatively, set pieces might inspire ideas on what to write into the script.

Honestly, I've found that there is nothing that quite matches everyone at the table having a shared understanding of the world. Whenever I've run homebrew worlds, there's always a lot of, ""Does my character know X?"" or ""You said your god of the Y believes in Z, right?"" and so on. It just bogs the game down."
project1999,ffc2314,t3_esowj4,1579789594.0,"I'm super happy to read some of these replies. Back when I started on this server like... 7 or 8 years ago, there was a general sense that necromancers weren't good for groups.

I'm really, really glad to see the environment has shifted since then!"
project1999,ffc0xzg,t1_ffbcmjz,1579788734.0,"Absolutely the case! Necromancers can do a lot for a group, one just had to adjust how they play their necromancer. Most of the bad stories of necromancers in parties come down to a necromancer trying to solo in a party setting. An enemy that dies in 12 seconds doesn't need a minute and a half DoT placed on it. If the necromancer adjusts their playstyle, they can be a great asset to a party.

The other thing I'd add is that it is good to get into groups regularly. It helps one get to know others at their level. When one solos their way up and then starts grouping, it can be harder to find a group than if you had grouped along the way and met people. Network early! Being able to solo the whole way up has a tendency to lead one to be a bit more isolated from the community."

I worked my ass off and I'd usually bring in a nice good bit during that overtime portion of the year. The rest of the year though, I got no overtime and it made things a lot tougher.

I was brought up for a promotion, and I looked at comparable pay for others doing the same kind of job, calculated the number of hours of overtime I was doing, added those together + 15% and asked them to make that my salary. It spreads the pay out throughout the entirety of the year, which is super convenient for paying bills on the regular, even when I don't have to work or pad my time to 40 hours during the slow parts of the year. Additionally, the more efficiently I get my share of the work done, the less overtime I have done and am still getting paid for that portion embedded in the salary I got.

project1999,fehkr3h,t1_fefpbye,1579118536.0,"Oh, I've no issue with such compromises really, as such things do divide a previously indivisible resource, and that's really the key thing needed. One idea I always liked was to add a stone or something in each raid boss zone. Each week a person with a raid can enter and kill the raid boss. To avoid abuse, we'd probably have to make it so periphery mobs drop no loot or XP, since raid mobs do spawn in regular world zones (like Sev or Trak). This leaves the open world version still on its usual schedule so guilds can race for it and have friendly competition without overly pressuring exclusion and contention. We'd also need to make an ingame raid management system so people could be properly entered into the right instance and get locked appropriately.

Sadly, I can't speak to how the game was by Gates of Discord. Luclin and PoP did a number on necromancer, and while many people liked the increased offensive ability, I love necromancer for its role as a strange support class. So I moved on to DAoC and didn't return until I found P1999.

And yeah, EverQuest showed the need for developers to innovate on raid bosses and raid design. Luckily they did. Sadly, some of the ways they innovated then attacked the basic idea of creating systems of players versus the world that encourage player interdependence. The more player interdependence is removed, the more toxic people generally seem to get. It's a real shame."

project1999,fef27mr,t1_feenf7j,1579046441.0,"Yeah, as much as it may tick off some people to say, I think instancing was something useful that ended up being created. So much of EverQuest's leveling and early on design is, either intentionally or unintentionally, conducive to player interdependence. That is to say, to be efficient and/or successful, it behooves people to make friends, help people in exchange for being helped, and so on. 

Whatever issues arise over camp disputes are generally drowned out by the degree to which the game world is the greatest challenge and every class can help and be helped by other classes in overcoming those challenges. 

Enter endgame, and suddenly we have a very limited resource (raid spawns) that a lot of people want to get. There's not much of a way to easily divide it up without server based rotations, which some communities did create and good on them for it, but otherwise it becomes a major source of contention. What was a system conducive to players working together with the people they come across becomes a system wherein the other guilds around you are all there to take the stuff you want. It encourages scummy behavior and an erosion of the generally positive environment the game created up to that point.

That isn't to say we can't have friendly competition, but the incentive structure is against it. EQ was such a hill to climb that the earliest people to rise to the top were more likely to be those who take the game far more seriously and therefore are less likely to just ""let it go"" if their raid gets a train dropped on them before they get some shiny new drop.

While instancing removes the chance of friendly competition in a guild vs guild type of fashion (there's still a race to get it down first, as in the WoW race to world first type of thing), it makes what was an indivisible resource into something more readily shared. It is the only real thing I'd change about classic.

AskReddit,febo5sq,t1_febkiwh,1578960955.0,"To me, those ideas are not mutually exclusive and differ in only a couple substantive ways which leads me to say that people are only accountable to themselves.

I don't see there being much in the way of anything independent in this world or universe. Everything is in some way conditioned by an insanely complex web of cause and effect that runs all the way back to the big bang. Within a closed system, the net energy will always equal back to the original sum, which means that all the stuff of the universe that is in it right now is as it was before... All that happens is it changed form and got more precise. To liken this to Alan Watts in his ""Out of Your Mind"" lecture series, it's as if someone threw a jar of ink at a wall. At the center, there's a thick concentration of ink that makes everything rather undifferentiated, but as you follow outward you see the streaks of ink grow more complex and precise. In the same way, the big bang has happened and is still happening, and we are one of the more differentiated, complex, and precise outcomes of that energy. I see no evidence yet of anything that exists independent of this system, meaning everything we are and have been is simply a reconfiguration of that original sum total of energy that exploded outward. 

As such, it is like having a big bowl of cookie dough and separating it out, and suddenly each pile thinking it is something unique and different... But it's still just cookie dough. Bake it, it is still that cookie dough, now just baked. Experience leads each of them to be ""separate"" in form, yet they are all still of that original stuff. In exactly the same kind of a way, the separations from person to person are ultimately illusory. Just as stars gather energy, fuse them, and explode to give more richness to this universe with different elements, so too are we gatherings of the same energy that shape how the universe is growing. Similar to how George Carlin once joked that maybe mother nature gave birth to human beings just to create plastic, we are creating new things in the universe just as the stars fused different elements from the elements they had available. We birth the future of all of our growth through our actions. What this means is that my accountability to myself is also my accountability to you, to my family, to my friends, to my community, to this world, for the aliens that most probably live elsewhere in this universe, and so on, as we are all extensions of that same original big bang, that same cookie dough.

I say we are all ultimately accountable to ourselves in particular for two reasons: 1) Understanding and compliance with this type of a philosophy is best achieved by people coming to it in their own desire to seek out. The most others should do, I think, is encourage and make positive the pursuit of knowledge that will lead someone to a path of better understanding of their interdependence with the universe. In other words, a lesson learned is better than a lesson forced. And 2) Related to the last, but for the concentration of energy and matter that has this perception of it being me, it is only me, the observer of my thoughts, that can truly exert any attempt to shape how this conglomeration of matter and energy would behave without me here. No matter how hard people try, there's no one who can make me or anyone else not live enslaved to their natural impulses. It has to be by the force of one's own will that they shape how they will contribute to the growth of this organism of which we are all a part.

There's my philosophy rant for the day. Just in time for D&D! :) The hostility I perceived was from the original comment, coming at me with quite a many assumptions, and then digging back into a comment here from almost a month ago to try and call me out on being wrong about HSA policies. I absolutely agree though that love is the best way forward, which is why regardless of whatever hostility there was, I love you nonetheless. That's how I'd rather this universe grow, so that's what I choose to put out into it."

In the meantime, I'll continue on with the numerous steps I have taken to minimize my impact. I leveraged my education to get a job wherein I only have to commute one day a week, and even that I am working to nullify. Secondly, I chose a car within my budget that gets 40 miles to the gallon when driven at exactly 65 MPH on cruise control with minor acceleration prior to going up hills to try and keep speed without a great deviation in RPMs. Each +/- 2 MPH from 65mph this point is a decrease in mileage to the gallon. I spent about 2 years after getting this car to map out its fuel usage to burn the least petrol. There has been some minor skewing of the numbers over the years as the car has aged, but not by too great a degree since I take care of my car. Third, living further away from the city and having access to land allows me to more safely grow supplemental food, build my own furniture and household essentials, more safely ride my bike to places I need to go with a lesser risk of getting killed by city driving, and more easily leave my windows open without excessive noise pollution which saves on my energy bill to keep this place cool during the summer months without running the AC constantly.

Demand a course of action if you wish, but just as I advised you earlier, we are each our own judge and are accountable to ourselves. I feel I am doing what I can within my ability to survive, so I am happy with my current equilibrium. I don't particularly care if you disagree and think it isn't enough. Short of you offering to spend nearly a million on me alone, I am satisfied with the steps I have taken.

gaming,fe2s8jv,t1_fe2m11i,1578842339.0,"Yeah, I didn't feel she was being selfish in TW3.

That said, it was more a selfishness of obsessive infatuation than it was a full character defining trait. It doesn't pervade the rest of who Triss is. She just isn't a particularly selfish person when she isn't Geralt-crazy. 

Yennefer is a far more selfish of person. She broke ranks with the Lodge to pursue her own goals and ambitions, she disregards other people to get her job done, and she doesn't generally give much weight to contrary opinions to her own. But this selfishness, while it is pervasive in her character, I think this is ""main character"" selfishness. It's like she's the one who has to fix shit, she's the one who always has to solve the problems she's confronted with, so anyone who gets in her way needs to just sit down and shut the fuck up.

Like the necromancy scene in the game, if Geralt isn't on board, she tells him to politely go fuck off as she has to do this to find Ciri.

todayilearned,fdvctns,t1_fdsyeyd,1578746077.0,"Okay, I wrote up this big thorough reply, but I feel like it was a wall of text that would dissuade anyone from reading it. If you'd like to have this expanded upon, let me know.

Basically, the ideas don't translate. A Buddhist's goal isn't to get ""good karma"" like in the title here, but to get rid of good, bad, and neutral karma. Note that Karma literally translates to the word ""Action"", not some grand judge that sits on high balancing the good and bad in the universe. The results of karma are different from karma itself, in the same way an effect is different from a cause. Karma has fruit, fruit which arises out of karma. The law of karma is strikingly similar to (but subtly different from) the law of cause and effect. There is karma/action (cause), and it produces some fruit/consequence (effect).

So is the consequence of any given action good or bad? It's hard to say. We don't live in a universe that is rigid enough to apply a universal law that all bad actions result in bad consequences. Sometimes people doing good things cause bad things to happen, and vice versa. The key thing for a Buddhist is that good, bad, and neutral karma all fuel the cycle of suffering in which we are sort of stuck.

As such, the goal of a Buddhist is to get rid of all karma, good bad and neutral. Now the immediate follow up would be to think that all Buddhists aspire to do nothing... But that's why I mentioned earlier this results in a crazy amount of explanation being necessary to convey the subtle points that differentiate karma. The goal of a Buddhist isn't to do nothing, it is to eliminate karma that is based on ignorance of reality fueled by craving, as the Buddha put forward in the Four Noble Truths. When one realizes Nirvana and there is the cessation of dukkha, one's actions still have effects (hence why I said it is similar to but different from cause/effect), but they are in sync with how reality actually is instead of how we perceive it in ignorance.

Yeah, this was the ""short"" version, lol. There's a lot of things that I just said here that are not fully formulated. If you have any questions, I'll do my best to answer! If you're interested in this philosophy, I recommend starting with Walpola Rahula's book What The Buddha Taught. It is a great general book with limited bias to one tradition over another."
todayilearned,fdspisu,t1_fdsjgc8,1578706273.0,"This is why I clarified that the Buddha means by intend in my last paragraph. This is the translation given by accesstoinsight on that relevant passage. The translation means behavior that we intend to do, something we do with awareness and cognizance. It isn't about the intentions of the action, just that the action is intended. Walpola Rahula in his book What The Buddha Taught refers to the same thing as volition."
todayilearned,fdson5l,t1_fdsjkgp,1578705955.0,"It is consistent with some schools of Buddhist thought, but it does require more explanation. The Buddha taught interdependence and connection between things, a complex web of coarising, or what Watts would call the dance of the universe. When we act volitionally, that is to say with intention through a sense of individual ego or self, that is what is kamma. This is what muddies up the water. By eroding the false sense of self as some independent thing from the universe, we can act wisely as a part of the universe. This is behavior without kamma, and the Buddha tells us that the achievement of this liberation from craving leads to compassion. This is the same compassion that the Buddha decided to follow after achieving nibanna and trying to decide whether or not to turn the wheel of the Dharma. 

When we act like this, as of the universe instead of independent of it, we are not mudding up the waters. This is the way Watts talks about it too, though he slants it in the Zen tradition.

Also a couple notes: In some traditions, one doesn't exactly go to nibanna, one realizes it. Nibanna is the true reality of the universe, that which resides beneath the layers of ignorance and illusion in which we live. By eroding this, we raise nibanna and are freed from it.  

Additionally, in some traditions (such as Theravada), enlightenment isn't quite as you describe. There is no such thing as individual enlightenment, as there is no individual. There is just enlightenment. The idea of enlightenment for the good of all living things was built off of this idea when the Mahayana tradition started and brought up the idea of bodhisattvas. Prior to that, it wasn't so much that Buddhism sought to reach enlightenment and bring all of humanity with you, but instead to realize that you and all of humanity are of the same, so your liberation is their liberation. This is one of those subtle differences between schools.

Please forgive typos and odd words, on phone so autocorrect can be problematic!"
todayilearned,fdsecst,t1_fdsau2z,1578700758.0,"One of my favorite Alan Watts quotes goes something like, ""The best way to clear muddy water is to let it be."" Our intentions might be good, but who is wise enough to truly see the karmic effects of their choices? With how thoroughly interdependent the world is, none. As such, the Buddha's whole argument was to eliminate that kind of behavior, get rid of karma and its fruits, and let the ""water"" that is the world settle. 

Far too often our attempts to control and fix things only cause more issues in the world, when all we really need to do is be able to let muddy water sit. Find a way to live with and as a part of nature rather than asserting ourselves as something independent of it. Or another classic line from someone I can't remember, ""All of humanity's troubles arises out of our inability to sit alone quietly.""."
todayilearned,fdsdxnp,t1_fds9toq,1578700462.0,"Totally with you on this, but I'd like to offer a clarification. In AN 6.63, the Buddha says:

>""Intention, I tell you, is kamma. Intending, one does kamma by way of body, speech, & intellect.""

and

>""And what is the result of kamma? The result of kamma is of three sorts, I tell you: that which arises right here & now, that which arises later [in this lifetime], and that which arises following that...""

In this way, karma is the intentional behavior (intending) we perform by physical action (body), verbal action (words), and intellect (thoughts). That which results from the karma are the consequences of it, often called the ""fruit"" of karma.

The Buddha isn't saying intending in the way of good intentions, but that our intentional actions of body, speech, and mind are karma and produce consequences, the fruits of karma. So for example, lets say we are walking along and beneath a dead leaf there is a slug. We step on the leaf in passing, crushing the slug. The killing of the slug wasn't intentional in body, speech, or thought, so it wasn't karma. To see the slug and then go ""Ewww! I'm going to step on that."" is intentional in body, speech, and mind. That is karma."
todayilearned,fdscptg,t1_fds4uz1,1578699624.0,"Yup. It's why a lot of Buddhist texts say that one has to cultivate both wisdom and compassion, as one without the other doesn't help much. One needs to cultivate both to act skillfully."
todayilearned,fdsche7,t1_fdrt5oo,1578699461.0,"Right? It doesn't make too much sense... The goal of much of Buddhist practice is to eliminate karma and its fruits. As one eliminates dukkha through the eightfold path, one also eliminates karma.

...

>""And what is the result of kamma? The result of kamma is of three sorts, I tell you: that which arises right here & now, that which arises later, and that which arises following that...

>""And what is the cessation of kamma? From the cessation of contact is the cessation of kamma; and just this noble eightfold path — right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration — is the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma."
witcher,fdqxo19,t1_fdqw6ek,1578676282.0,"The way I describe it is that Yen seems like she's the main character in her own game/book series. She's got her own adventures, her own tasks, and she isn't just there to be a character for Geralt. I feel like this shined quite nicely in TW3 with the whole necromancy thing. I could easily see a main character in a RPG doing the same thing Yen did there to get the necessary information, and then when a side character objects, disregarding it and living with the [X will remember that!] thing.

They each have their own stories, and from time to time, those stories overlap and they work well together.

dndmemes,fdq6x7t,t1_fdpn2d6,1578657477.0,"Whenever this topic comes up, I swear I played a different 4e than everyone else. I started back in 2e and I switched editions each time. 3 and 3.5e were so damn crunchy it was insane. I had a buddy in college who made a character who could break a planet in two at level 7. That's how ridiculous 3.5e could be when it came to pulling obscure rules from different books together. Most games I ran would get bogged down on the rules and the math behind it, not to mention just how unsatisfying the early levels were.

Enter 4e. They skimmed the mechanics down so much that combat became a breeze to get through to get back to story and character roleplay. People who liked the crunch could still play 3.5e and Pathfinder, there's nothing wrong with enjoying crunch at all, but 4e then became a game to use when you wanted simple mechanics to focus instead on story and RP.

That said, I am super happy with 5e and am glad with the middle ground they have struck between the crunchy 3.5e and the almost braindead simple 4e. It's just that looking at how some people respond talking about 4e, I'd swear we played entirely different systems. If someone really wants a combat focused tabletop RPG, I feel they'd look for something more complex than 4e. 4e was really useful for people who wanted a low math system to focus instead on playing characters and telling cool stories.

Edit: Also, interesting [video from Matt Coleville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoELQ7px9ws) about 4e. In the comments about it, he also brings up the idea that 4e is discouraging roleplaying:

>""Something I left out, because I felt it would derail the video a little..

>One common criticism of 4E is that it ""discouraged roleplaying."" Now, certainly we had LOTS of roleplaying in my 4E game.

>But there is a problem here and it's down to 4E's Powers. If you give you players a list of cool things to do in combat...they are going to want to do them.

>This may seem obvious, or non-controversial, but what it meant was players got impatient with problems that couldn't be solved with their powers. By making combat super-cool (more fun than any other edition in my opinion) players were eager to get to  combat, and tended to eschew roleplaying.

>Is that a criticism of 4e? Yeah, I think so. Is that the same as ""discouraging roleplaying?"" Mm...not in the sense I think people meant, although maybe the end is the same.

Thinking of it in this way, the groups I played with never really thought of their RP ability as limited by their combat ability. We've always treated it as ""Oh, you can cast a fire cantrip? Okay, you can create a minor fire for RP purposes"" and the like. Mechanics really only dictate the combat side, outside of that RP is far more fluid into what fits the style of character. So perhaps that bridges the gap."
dndmemes,fdmz2lo,t1_fdmxkxt,1578572004.0,"EasyDamus is the best for this. It gives a very solid and deep look at each alignment with relevant D&D sources.

http://easydamus.com/

For some characters, a lawful attitude will show itself through strict adherence to a written law of civilization, such as the worshipers of Helm. Helm exemplified his adherence to written law when he was willing to destroy Mystra to bar her from reaching the heavens as she hadn't satisfied the letter of Ao's request.

However, on the other side, we have a similarly Lawful Neutral god like Hoar who exemplifies almost the total opposite, yet within the same alignment. Hoar doesn't give a single fuck about written law, what he cares about is the truest conception of rendering to each what is due to each. As such, Hoarites often operate outside of the laws of civilization, being renegades and vigilantes that take justice into their own hands. 

So a good clashing comparison of these two types: There's a rich asshole who structured the Kingdom's laws to favor him (a Lawful Evil guy, basically). The rich asshole is a sadist, and so he decides to go to a farmer just outside of town but still under town law. He ties up the farmer and forces the farmer to watch as he tortures and murders his family and children. The farmer is left with nothing. He goes to the town and he demands justice. Helmites look into the issue and find that the rich asshole was acting within the letter of the law. It's a shame, the Helmite would probably truly feel bad and possibly be willing to work on changing the law, but no law was broken so they wouldn't act on it. The farmer returns home and takes an offering, puts it in a pouch, whispers a prayer to Hoar as he buries the gold pouch. 

A Hoarite, known as a Doombringer, comes along and gets the pouch and the prayer begging for justice. The Doombringer investigates, sees that the rich asshole abused the law and is just a total piece of shit. So the Doombringer sneaks into the rich asshole's house, knocks out some of his guards, finds the rich asshole. He proceeds to torture the rich asshole for the night, flaying, fingernail ripping, cutting out large chunks of his flesh, all the stuff the rich asshole did to the farmer's family. The Doombringer then takes the rich asshole up to the roof on the front of the building as day dawns and people are starting to go about their day. The Doombringer forces the rich prick to confess what he had done under threat of more pain. The rich asshole croaks his confession to the gathering crowd.

The Helmites see the Doombringer. The Doombringer is breaking the law, so they start to rush up to stop him. Now, some Helmites who were involved in the farmer's case might... go a bit slower. They might create some bureaucratic slowdown because they recognize what is happening, but it is their duty to restrain the Doombringer. Just as the Helmites break out onto the roof, the Doombringer drops the rich asshole with a noose around his neck to snap it. The Doombringer and Helmite fight, the Helmites needing to restrain and arrest the Doombringer, and the Doombringer needing to get away... Neither of them really want to kill the other, as they both recognize they are different sides of the same coin: Bringing justice to those that deserve it. They may disagree with how justice is best served, but they are both trying to serve justice.

That's my Helmite/Hoarite story to clash these two sides of Lawful Neutrality. Lawful can show up as strict adherence to law, but more than that, lawful generally means that one feels structure, order, consistency between people is better than the alternative. This structure, order, consistency may be letter of written law, or it might be a divine ordinance, or some other type of scripture or structure. It is just structure that best serves to make things run best in the world.

Edit: Oh, we can add a Tyrite to the story too. Tyrites being LG are more open to changing the written law to better reflect Justice, whereas Helmites are reticent to change laws. Given what went down, the Helmites might be more receptive to it, so a Tyrite would probably use this whole scenario as a basis to get Helmite support for changing the laws to increase protection of the underclasses. It would be difficult as the nobility are going to be scared shitless that one of their own just got tortured and strung up inside his own estate and the town guard didn't stop him. To get such a protection law passed, they might have to bargain some new type of privilege law for the nobility... But that's the type of political conflict to expect in a Lawful side of the spectrum storyline!"

A Norseman and a Greek hoplite would have two very different understandings of how the universe worked would they meet and discuss it."

The only thing I am interested in is having a CTRL + F through my hard covered books. VTM gave a PDF code with their most recent book, D&D could do the same, but thus far has not had the push to do the same. I hope they will in time."
