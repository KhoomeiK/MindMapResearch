AskReddit,f8qtk1g,t3_e19f4z,1574723877.0,i was on the ending part of a mission trip to Malaysia and we were spending a day surfing and just having a blast on the beach with the natives. this was around 2018 when the large hurricane hit Japan and the waves started getting huge on the beaches in Malaysia but we didn't know about the hurricane yet. and I was getting some insane waves but then this one wave came in and was probably 20-30 feet high and I was totally unprepared for it and I tried to dive below it but I ended getting caught in it and was slammed into the sand bar about 100 feet from shore. I face planted and scorpioned pretty hard and got caught spinning under water and couldnt pull myself out. My nose was broken and I fractured two of my ribs so I gasped when I got slammed into the sand and pulled in a lot of water. I'm not sure how long I was held under water but I didn't know which way was up and could feel the water in my lungs. I ended up coming to the surface throwing up water and blood streaming down my face. somehow made it back to the beach and my friends said my face looked like a raw hamburger that was dropped in the sand. I'm doing fine now and my nose is a little crooked but im grateful I didn't drown that day because I know many many have from being trapped under the surf.
