To expand on the reasoning its because everyone seemed so fake, well except for Ed and maybe Bill. I get it’s a social networking game but all these relationships were so phony. “We’re best friends” and “I love you” were common phrases repeated over and over and we were thinking.. these people haven’t even met each other in real life or even with video chats. It’s all text messages. Why isn’t anyone acting real? Maybe it’s just the way the show was edited but everything to us seemed so superficial.

funny,fei64wi,t1_fehug1p,1579131129.0,"> You are the reason rural people hate ""liberals"". Not everyone wants to live in the city. Do you understand how you sound when you tell someone that what they want out of life and where they want to live isn't good enough so they deserve to be poor?

What are you even trying to argue? If you can't pay your bills in your current location and they are ZERO jobs for you (unlikely but I'll play along), you don't just stay there looking for a handout from the government... You go to where you can find work. Because LIFE has a cost in America. Unless you already have a nest egg saved up you will have to work because rent isn't free.. food isn't free.. and taxes are a thing. That has nothing to do with your political affiliation. You are an idiot."
funny,fei4dax,t1_fei31us,1579130015.0,I highly doubt your job only exists in Toronto. But let’s says it’s does. So what are your options? Well if you are getting by ok than you can stay put. But if you are struggling and you know what you are doing is not going to be able to sustain you then you really need to think about finding a completely different job than the one you currently have. And when picking a replacement job hopefully you’d do some research and figure out: Does this new job have long term need where I will have job security? Is there room for growth in the field? Can I find an affordable living situation near this job? Again.. Life is tough. People will always bitch and moan which is okay short term. But when you take no actions to better your situation and instead you carry on bitching and moaning.. understand you have become the obstacle in your own way.

But really my statement isn’t limited to financial situations. People put roadblocks up form themselves all the time and decide it’s easier to bitch and moan about whatever there current issue is instead of deciding to take on a scary and challenging new course of action to remedy their issue. It’s hard to feel bad for people who only complain without actually taking steps to resolve whatever ails them. Living life isn’t easy. Complaining about life is."

SandersForPresident,feh7eqi,t3_ep3c8v,1579110701.0,"I really want to know what will happen to medical staff's pay if this is implemented. Medicare does not pay full price when they reimburse hospitals and other medical facilities for services rendered. Will nurses have to continue dealing with being underpaid and overworked as hospitals are already finding it hard to make ends meet? If you have doubts about what I say go talk to nurses and listen how they will tell you there is often a shortage of equipment on hand and the patient load is often too much for the nurses yet they have to carry on even though it is unsafe because they are trying to save the lives of people in need. I want M4A because I believe it is a right not a privilege. You don't let sick people die because they cant afford it. But unless the government is picking up the tab and fairly reimbursing these facilities for the services they provide, I don't understand how the system will work. Is 4% of everyone's income really enough to support M4A?"

politics,fefkc2c,t3_eousl5,1579058150.0,Medicare doesn't reimburse the full cost of care. If everyone is on the government care plan the hospital will be out money. Patient volume is not an alternative to a lack of full reimbursement for services rendered. I am a Bernie supporter but my girl is a nurse who is already overworked and underpaid and so M4A does scare me because there is uncertainty how medical staff will get paid in a system that fewer dollars are flowing into. Its not okay but healthcare is a business in America and doing a major overhaul of the system will have unintended consequences. I'd like to see a plan really laid out that addresses these kind of issues instead of talking points that just go back in forth in the media.

I am kind of bummed we botched the tank and ended up winning as many as we did. Even though it was a sweet victory to stop the Pats from getting a playoff bye I would have rather it didn’t happen and we would of lost 15 game this season to secure the number 1 pick. As it currently stands I would not trade our top picks away as I think we have too many position holes that need filling and there is no guarantee Burrow is going to be everything people hope and assume he will be in the NFL."

skeptic,fdojvwx,t1_fcpbrky,1578606625.0,"I’m late to this thread. I just listened to a ‘This American Life’ podcast about Alex Jones and then did a Reddit search on him. Jones was/is an eccentric conspiracy theorist who at times could have been fun to watch because of how off the wall he was. However I think most sane people lost any fascination with him because of the Sandy Hook shooting denials and his constant pushing that it was fake and the families were actors. 

But I will defend Joe Rogan’s right to give Jones and every other loon an outlet to be interviewed because I believe in free speech. Joe makes podcasts. He brings in people he finds interesting and listens and tries to have a conversation. Just because he doesn’t push back on everything they say doesn’t make him a bad guy. Joe is simply an entertainer. You don’t have to like Joe or any of the guests he has on or his podcast. Your comments here make you look close minded and like a stereotypical caricature that has pushed people far towards the right as they want to get away from know-it-all people like you.
