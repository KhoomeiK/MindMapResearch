facepalm,ffamcxd,t1_ff7qi7p,1579739324.0,"Well then why only deer?  There are many other animals or hazards that are common in some areas but don’t have signs. For instance cows, dogs, squirrels, raccoons, bears... all of them cause accidents but rarely have signs.  Also what about large trucks.  71% of all multi vehicle accident deaths are from large trucks.  And large trucks often utilize the same roads.  Car accidents that cause death are no joke! 

Also, please don’t speak of most without supportive data.  Otherwise it is just your option.  One last question,,, do you drive a Camry?"
facepalm,ff7o1lz,t1_ff4t388,1579654166.0,"So you think those signs are worth the millions of dollars that go into creating, clearing, installing, and maintaining?"
facepalm,ff4pd1v,t1_fev383e,1579569222.0,I see it every month.  I live in a very rural county and commute 38 miles to a city every day.  I am just saying a sign is not going to prevent that tragedy.  I know deer are the deadliest of all animals because of traffic fatalities associated with them.
facepalm,ff4p4my,t1_fev7eos,1579569057.0,Being alert?  Shouldn’t you always be alert when driving?  And if you are not... that is a change.

facepalm,feuvkwq,t3_eqngm1,1579390396.0,Those signs are stupid anyway.  Who has ever changed their driving for a period of time because of a deer crossing sign?  Waste of money.

nutrition,fdwrpbw,t3_emy4lk,1578761717.0,Why did I get so many thumbs down?  The environment differences between almonds and dairy?  Look how much water it takes to raise cows vs. almond trees.  Or just the carbon footprint between the two.  Huge difference not even debatable.
nutrition,fdwpe4c,t1_fdvv7xq,1578761083.0,It’s a food that tends to make the body more acidic.  An acidic balance requires the body to compensate to maintain a very strict acid base balance.  And the most alkalic element in the body is calcium.  So if we eat to much acid forming foods or not enough alkaline forming foods our bodies will pull calcium out to balance the body.  This is why the countries with the highest dairy consumption also have the highest osteopenia.  Well it’s a strong correlation at least.

nutrition,fdsk2iu,t3_emy4lk,1578704153.0,"There are only about 2.5 grams of fat per serving anyway.  Very minimal, even if it does cause inflammation.  Which I agree with the other posts in that it does not.  Dairy milk on the other hand is full of sugar/lactose and is a strong acid forming food.  Not good for the environment or our bodies."
facepalm,fcivopa,t1_fcite8d,1577670932.0,I am not so sure.  Seems like a lot of odd illogical and uninformed references.  I also hope it’s not because this is the funniest thing on here tonight.
facepalm,fciro15,t3_eha34d,1577668206.0,She needs to start lower and increase it slowly.  Just like Uncle Sam.  Amateur hour.
Roadcam,fbcbetu,t3_ecjiv3,1576720080.0,I drove this bridge from the other side. Super scary.  Two way traffic on the same bridge.  And the edge was an infinity edge with just a raised railing.
