People keep saying this but does anyone remember the massive changes that happened right around overwatch's drop.

There was the competitive added to that famously *casual* game! oh and those great community servers, those were actually removed from the search feature, right around the time overwatch dropped (not sure if they ever changed that back). The change was you queue instead of finding a server you like and that tickles your fancy.

On top of that because of these changes the matchmaking took honest to god ages. 

It was miserable

Holy shit, just typing this out gets me worked up, this isnt directed at you btw, its just that game was so fucking awful for that period. Im not sure if its still like that, either!!! because i unisntalled and never reinstalled after 2k hours or so. and bought overwatch. But tf2 was in dire straights, not of losing its players, hell i dont think the game will ever die, but in danger of losing its identity even more.

Note: while im thinking of botches, Dont forget valve cocking up the hat economy

tf2, is basically all but forgotten by its devs, years between actual significant updates. The comics, which were gold have also stopped! With blizzard you have these detailed Kaplan updates, with valve you get absolute contempt. I mean can we all just clap for how good overwatches update videos were conpared to the contempt and silence sandwich valve serves up?

Honestly people are idealizing tf2 based on memories and overwatch is recent and much easier to disparage. But there are real problems with tf2, the game is flawed 6 ways to sunday, as much as overwatch. 



I love the time i spent with tf2. Love the game. Used to love overwatch, too. But changes happened that drove me away to both of them, so i simply dont understand this romanticization of tf2."

politics,ffo01j2,t1_ffnnebs,1580072829.0,"extremely difficult question to answer, becaus ewe may not have a candidate that can get the dems to vote as a block. So Short answer. I don't know, no one in the senate, on the dems part, seems to be capable of the rolem

Long answer:

So right now, Schumer is the obvious pick, being minority leader, but...

The fact dem senators are out there voting against the block, rather than standing strong against an adversarial president, like the republicans did under Obama shows me that he is not capable of arm twisting and ear pulling. Now maybe you could attribute this to mcconell having dirt on each and every senator with an r, but i would imagine its nore in part because hes damn good at what he does and schumer just doesnt have the clout necessary... or something.

 

Also worth noting that I would have never pegged mcconnell to be as good at keeping the block as he is. He was rather unassuming compared to mccain and graham back before the obama era. Heck when trump hit the presidency i figured now the infighting would start, yet the line has been held. This shows how much churning goes on behind the scenes.

On the other hand, the big names may be washed aside in the next election for someone to take the reigns, but i dont know.

Ultimately whoever they nominate will be the one who is best at getting them to vote together, as that is the barest requirement for becoming minority leader. Their best doesn't necesaairly mean good enough. 

Honestly this question has me nervous about our prospective dem leadership. The big names, Neither booker or klobuchar, are any more likely to have more clout than warren, and definitely not more than schiff. Perhaps gillibrand? Schiff is most likely, warren is most likeable, but who is most capable? I havent the faintest idea."

America has a lot of racial pains under the surface. I dont think the fbi ever needed to put a hit on him, all they needed was for angry bigots to be scared and eventually someone would do it."
KOTORmemes,ff41f3b,t1_ff3ls3r,1579553447.0,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news but neither is obsidian. Obsidian had a massive talent drain due to layoffs, and mismanagement, and that was back around fallout  new vegas, well after kotor 2.

Now that being said they did make outerworlds (or was it outerwilds?) Which was a fun, and a great game from what i hear. 

But the fact remains is the obsidian that made kotor 2 is as close to the obsidian today as the bioware of yesteryear is to the bioware of today. 

I'd still trust obsidian more because they arent owned by ea, but lets no rose tint the situation. The people who made those games great probably arent around. Itd be entirely new teams."

AccidentalRenaissance,ff2avwz,t1_ff21myu,1579499080.0,"Actually if i recall correctly, the japanese and american animation industry outsourced to china, and, for a time, south korea (during the 90's and 00s though conditions have probably changed for south South Korea), because labor was cheaper and the animators there were paid less.

So, while japan animators may not be living luxuriously, or even well, it might be the better option of two bad options. I mean there is healthcare, modernized living, it may be considerably more attractive to animate in japan than the country you live in, depending on what coubtry that is. It may be a step down if you l8ve in europe, or a considerable step up if you live in say, Brunei.

Also, i am passing no vindication nor damnation of any particular country. I think it is worth noting the animation industry being exploitive is rather infamous even in the west, though maybe not to the same degree."
