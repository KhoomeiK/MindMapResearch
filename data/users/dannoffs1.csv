NintendoSwitch,ff80tda,t1_ff7yook,1579663032.0,"What part of ""I didn't even state my opinion about whether or not they should have reviews."" Didn't you understand? 

And I'm talking about smash because that's the example the original commenter was talking about. They said review bombing for something like smash is a problem, then op said limiting it to people who have bought it solves that issue, I then said it wouldn't because you'd have to have the game to be upset."
NintendoSwitch,ff7y1eg,t1_ff7x224,1579661068.0,What on Earth are you going on about? I didn't even state my opinion about whether or not they should have reviews. The only thing I've said in this comment thread is that limiting reviews to just people that own the game wouldn't stop review bombing.
trees,ff7vx2i,t1_ff7usrp,1579659623.0,"Gun control is neither of those things.  It's background checks, licensing, caps on magazine size, etc. You know, how we handle other dangerous things like vehicles."
NintendoSwitch,ff7tngn,t1_ff7pr46,1579658086.0,"How could you have possibly gotten that from what I said? I haven't even played smash.

My point was that limiting reviews to just people who own the game would do nothing about review bombing because the only people that would be upset enough to review bomb already own the game."
NintendoSwitch,ff7g74e,t3_es1shd,1579648812.0,"I wish it would recommend other games that people who play similar games to me play, but I'm glad there aren't reviews."
NintendoSwitch,ff7flin,t1_ff7b67b,1579648416.0,That wouldn't address the problem they brought up at all. The only people that would be review bombing smash because of characters added would be people who already own and play smash.

Personally, the quality of life changes made in SwSh made this the first time I've been interested in the competitive aspect of literally any videogame (I have shitty hand-eye coordination)"
NintendoSwitch,feoyymb,t1_feoxncb,1579308436.0,"SwSh at least reviewed well, and if you were never attached to the features they removed (like me, having not played since gen 3) was a competent game.

I know I'm not going to convince you of anything, and honestly even I could you're not worth the effort. So this is for anyone that happens to scroll by.

The only studies controlling for all social, economic, and environmental factors show both black and white people (teens actually, in the case of the studies) commiting violent crime at the same rate.

Anyone can cherry pick statistics.

83 percent of white murders are by other white people and white people murder more white females than black people murder black females. When are we going to accept as a society that white people are genetically predisposed to murder women? That's obviously a dumb argument to make even though the statistics technically back it up, just like 13/50 is a dumb argument.
