SonyAlpha,ffecq3n,t3_et12w9,1579843291.0,"Also, “budget” is very different in FF than in APS-C. You can get excellent APS-C lenses for that a6100 for far less than you can for the a7II. 

The inexpensive “good “ option for the a7II would be the Tamron 28-75 at around $900 or the Sigma 24-70 at around $1200 after tax. If you want the really good lenses, the G Master 24-70 will set you back over $2200. 

There are less expensive alternatives, but less expensive is a relative term. 

My entire APS-C setup, including an a6000, four primes and two zooms cost a good bit less than what I have I just my a7III and Tamron 28-75. 

Also, you mentioned video. If you’re planning to do selfie type videos, FF gear is a lot harder to hold in one hand at arms length , even on a gimbal vs a much lighter APS-C setup with a lot of vloggers use. 

But the FF setup has its good points too. Better low light performance, better for Astro (which is why I went FF), etc. 

Just keep in mind that if you get into FF it becomes far more expensive for everything than if you go with APS-C. Plus FF is heavier and the lenses are much larger than their APS-C counterparts. Go into it with open eyes and enjoy,  no matter what direction you go."

relationships,ffeb5s6,t1_ffe7267,1579841860.0,"Yep. This. I got fired from a Walmart when I was 20 because I was stupid. Lesson learned, never happened again. It happens a lot. And it happens a lot to people who did nothing wrong. That’s the joy of a “Right to Work” state. They can fire you at any time for any reason, or no reason.  

Hell, I lost my high school job at a hobby shop because the woman who ran it didn’t like the fact that I had after-school commitments occasionally. I still remember her words “you need to decide what’s more important. This after-school crap or your job here at Hobby Town”. 

I chose school and she fired me. And that place didn’t last more than another year or so before it went under. It was horribly managed by that woman, who was the franchisee, she ran it into the ground."

sex,ffd5u9n,t3_eszh8p,1579814001.0,"The first thing you can do is ditch that guy. It’s one thing in a successful and committed and most importantly trustful relationship to be able to appreciate attractive people alone and even together. 

My wife often points out attractive ladies when we’re out together and I point out attractive men to her. But we trust and truly love each other and that, for us, is an extension of our mutual love of people watching. And we most certainly do not compare each other to these people, nor do we belittle each other in those comparisons. 

What this guy is doing is looking at and trying to get with other girls behind your back. He’s making you feel like shit deliberately being mentally and emotionally abusive. 

This is abuse. You are being abused.  

Get out and get away from that jerk. You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, not some asshole who is just using you to fulfill an urge while he shops around. 

I guarantee that if he isn’t already physically cheating on you, he will. He doesn’t care about you. He doesn’t love you."
relationships,ffc37h6,t3_estqua,1579790416.0,"Sounds more like he didn't get suspended, sounds like he got fired and just told you he was suspended to avoid telling you he got fired, yet again, from yet another job for something stupid.  Honestly, if he worked for me, and did what you described, I'd have fired him on the spot.

More to your question though, honestly, it sounds like this guy is not capable of actually adulting and you, much as you don't see it, are kinda enabling that, at least mildly.  He needs to get out on his own and support himself and learn to keep a job and not do stupid shit for a while.  Unless, of course, you're ready for a lifetime of this and a future divorce.

I think it would be a bad idea to get married right now, because you have a 7 year history of this guy not being able to keep a job because he does such incredibly stupid stuff and gets fired, repeatedly.  I mean, everyone gets fired once or twice, it happens, it's a learning experience.  But when it happens over and over for years and years, it becomes evident that the problem is not the employers, but the employee.  

So there's your choice.  You can just accept that you're going to be his parent, supporting him while he either doesn't bother working, or works menial jobs he keeps getting fired from and finds it impossible to get a job in his degree field due to having such a bad work history.  OR you can call it off until either he grows up and can show he's capable of supporting himself (and you, should the need arise), or he doesn't and you move on, as painful as that sounds.

In my own experience, my wife can support me if I lose my job.  It's happened, I've been laid off twice due to offshoring, and both times between unemployment payments and her salary, we've survivied, even though it's been crazy tight.  And if my wife quit her job today, I could support us both comfortably for quite some time as well.  But this is a partnership.  She knows I can and will support her should the need arise, and I know she can and will support me should the need arise.  Can you say the same?  If you lost your job today, you and your fiancee would be homeless within a couple months, or you'd burn through whatever savings you have incredibly quickly.  Because he can't seem to keep a job because he thinks blackmailing his boss for more money is a good idea, after reading documents he had no business reading?

There are just too many red flags there..."

AmItheAsshole,ff6dw11,t3_ervar5,1579625068.0,"NAH is what I'm going with.  You, as you said, grieved months ago and to you this was just a sad inevitability.  But also, on their part, they're freshly grieving in their own way, angry and sad, and while they're hurt that you weren't there, they're also trying (mostly, I think) to direct that anger elsewhere.  

You've provided no context that your mom and sister are routinely assholes outside of family tragedy, so I wouldn't worry about it.  But maybe as part of the healing process, you give them time to come to terms with things on their own, and then maybe sit down and explain the situation, both that you had come to terms with her pending death months before, and that you were not able to financially back out of this trip that you'd saved for and paid for very far in advance.  And if they STILL want to be angry over that, well, that's on them at that point, but at least you can give them a fair chance at understanding.

I, personally, would not begrudge someone who had prior plans if they stuck to those plans for whatever reason.  I've missed many funerals due to various things, work travel, illness, distance, etc, and while it's nice to be there with your family, it's just not always possible, because death happens at the most inconvenient times."

A PM doesn't necessarily have to be very tech skilled, they need to have all the management and soft skills that engineers typically lack, and need to be able to interact with engineers and Pointy Haired Bosses and customers.  Tech Leads/managers, on the other hand manage the technical aspects of the project, lead the engineering staff and they DO need to have $CLUE to do that job.

I'm a technical manager / developer and do some PM stuff as well, but I couldn't ever do a full time PM job, I'm nowhere near organized enough, but I have enough organization and soft skills that I can manage my engineers and translate their speech into ""non-tech"" for non-tech savvy PMs, execs and customers if need be, and I put on a mean Dog and Pony show."

Even within the Federation, different races have their own design language. Vulcan ships look different than Human ships which look different than Andorrian, which look different from other members of the federation as far as design language.

As you come up the road from town there are no less than 14 (FOURTEEN) signs along the roadside and painted warnings on the pavement, telling drivers that to continue on the highway they need to take the left exit at the stoplight.  Daily, these drivers (always in 18 wheelers) blow past all fourteen signs, straight through the junction and end up at a four way intersection (the only place to turn around) and either spend 20 - 30 minutes trying to turn a large articulated vehicle around in a small four way intersection, or get stuck doing so and have to sit for an hour or more waiting on a sufficiently large tow truck to pull them back out.  


there's a highway in western NC, 18 wheelers are prohibited because there is one section of road that is nothing but hairpins and switchbacks and it's simply impossible for some trailers (lowboys especially) to navigate because they high center on the off-camber turns.  The signs, very large highway signs, warning them that the road is impassible by 18 wheelers, and that they are, in fact, prohibited, start at least 30 miles out, and repeat every few miles imploring them to turn around, and there are plenty of places for them to turn the rigs around.  Yet every week there is at least one who either ignores the signs, or just doesn't bother reading, who gets stuck on the road in a tight curve and that blocks traffic for hours (sometimes 6 - 8 hours or more) waiting on wreckers to come (sometimes from over 2 hours away) to free the truck (presuming they didn't come around a curve taking up the whole road due to their size and hit a much smaller oncoming car or motorcycle which is an entirely different set of problems."

I don't often dive into post history, but the fact that of every response you got to that post the only two answers that are more than 1 line are 1: someone who is disabled, and CANT work and uses music as therapy, and 2: someone who has had a 40 year career in music starting as a child, neither of which describe you.  The remaining ALL are adult enough to understand the need to work to support themselves and a retirement, while also pursuing their passion of a career in music.  
But you refuse to listen to any of us who know exactly why your mother is panicky, so I doubt you picked up on that nuance of their careers in music production either."

You live at home, in a house your parents pay for, you do not support yourself.  You might not have credit card debt, but you are not paying the bills, you are not buying all the food, you are not paying the rent or mortgage, you are not paying the insurance, you are not providing to support yourself finanically. YOUR PARENTS ARE SUPPORTING YOU FINANCIALLY, even IF you have money stashed away, unless you are doing all of the things I just listed, YOU ARE NOT SUPPORTING YOURSELF FINANCIALLY and do not seem to have the first clue, despite your protestations otherwise, how to actually be a functional, self-sufficient, adult.    


Just own it.  You figured out how to live for free, on your parents' purse.  Good on you, own that shit and don't get upset because everyone else understands EXACTLY why your mom is trying to give you money, and why she's upset her homeless, unemployed adult child is not taking the money she feels you need to survive.  SHOW HER you can support yourself, do all those things listed above, and she'll lay off.  It's that simple."

Right now, she sees her child jobless, homeless, and incapable of providing for herself, so your mother is trying to do what she feels you cannot.  

If you truly don't need her money, then go get your own place, buy your own food, pay your own bills and THEN tell her you don't need her money, nor do you need a job because ""money doesn't support you"".

relationships,feeey92,t1_feear16,1579032367.0,"I didn't paint it any such way.  What I said is that you're an unemployed 31 year old adult who is 100% dependent on her parents to survive while trying to become a music producer.  What I said is that you should absolutely follow your dream but you should do so while actually not eating your parents money up as a 31 year old adult without a job, place to live, or means to provide for herself.

Every one of those examples you gave are of people who actually worked and earned while getting where they want to be, or they started at the ground floor and worked their way up from the proverbial mail room to the proverbial exectuive floor.

People with a knack for fashion don't just appear.  In most cases they work and go to school and learn fashion design.  The ones that do not and are still successful are very rare.  One of my best friends did just this, has a degree in fashion design and works in the industry in NYC.  Know what she calls people ""with a knack for dressing people up"" who think they can study at home and break into the industry?  ""Administrative Assistant"".

People who go into architecture got to a university and get a degree in engineering (sometimes several degrees).

People who love culinary do one of to things.  They go to culinary school and earn their way in and work their way up after several years, or they start as the lowest of the low and work their way up after many, many years.  They don't just sit at home watching YouTube videos and reading cookbooks and then show up at a restaurant expecting any sort of paying job.

People who own a business do something you are not doing.  They work at another job and spend every waking moment of their off hours getting that business off the ground while they work and provide for themselves and their families in the meanwhile, OR they work the job they hate for years ( which leads them to a stronger desire to own their own business) and then they risk their life's savings to open that business.

Point is, not a single one of those things involves people who didn't start at the very bottom adn WORK their way up, most of them involve education and training and in some cases licensing.

Now, maybe you're doing exactly those things, but that's not what you described.  What you described is:

""I have no job and live entirely dependent on my parents and it annoys me that my mom keeps wanting to give me money to live on while I sit at home trying to break into the music industry on my own without any formal education or training.""

My entire point (and the point of everyone else that you've chosen to ignore) is that you should stop complaining about free money from mom, and start providing for yourself as a 31 year old adult, and figure out how to get into the music industry from there.  But don't complain about your parents trying to give you money."
relationships,fee9d9f,t3_eootyj,1579029094.0,"As others have said, she's your mom and she's worried about her very adult aged daughter who is unemployed and living at home because she wants to be a ""producer"" while basically not contributing anything at all to your own future.  

Look, on the one hand, I applaud you for following your dream, I truly do.  People (myself included) should be less willing to abandon their dreams. BUT you're THIRTY ONE YEARS OLD.  It sounds like you need some reality, so here is some reality.  I don't produce music, but I have friends who do.  One friend has been trying to become a producer as long as I've known him (about 20 years at this point).  He still works a ""normal"" job, and still tries to break into the music production biz, and still has not managed to break into it.  The other moved to Hollywood to get into music production and STILL worked a normal job for decades (he's my age, mid-40s) and only got a ""real music job"" as he puts it in the last few years.  He still had to work ""normal"" jobs all that time to pay his rent, bills, buy food, and basically live.

The music industry, like the acting industry, and professional sports have about a million people who think they're good enough to make it big, when in reality the number of people who actually get in are a fraction of a fraction of that number, and the ones that are truly successful at it even fewer.

I'm not saying that you need to abandon your dream, by all means keep at it, I hope, I truly hope that you succeed, but in the mean time, you really, really need to start being an actual, productive adult, rather than eating away at your parents' retirement funds.  If you want it bad enough, you'll figure out how to get there while also working to provide for yourself."
Outdoors,fee2254,t1_fecp00f,1579024772.0,"Hah, yeah... I do enjoy watching the ones that venture into our yard in the mornings while I sip on my coffee, or in the evenings just around and slightly after sunset, especially when they have fawns in tow.  But they are ridiculously overpopulated here, unfortunately, and they do cause havok on the roads (all rural so people dart along at 55-70 depending on the time of day).  That 8-10 per day number I got from the trooper who came to give us a report for insurance purposes when my wife hit hers.  Heck, there was a period in the mid '00s where I hit one every year for about 4 years.  

I was driving 100+ miles a day commuting to and from work, and woud buy cheap (>$1000) cars to tear up on that commute, and for a while I'd total about one a year hitting a deer after dark, especially in the spring and fall.  Heh, at one point I had bought a new (to me) truck and the day after I bought it one came out of the dark and slammed into the bed leaving a nice huge dent as I was driving home from getting groceries.  Hadn't even owned the truck more than 48 hours at that point.

But that one reason we moved back out into the country was to enjoy nature rather than having the neighborhood kids always scoping out what we owned (car break-ins were an epidemic where we were living).  We get a lot of really lovely birds in the yard too, especially in the spring, and occasionally we'll catch Fox in the yard too, usually hunting the rabbits."

I took both the 28-75 and a 16-35 to Paris and found I used the 16-35 more (almost exclusively). So I was considering selling it and just picking up something in the 40-50mm range. 

But then I took both to Taipei and used them about about 50/50 so I suppose maybe I’ll just keep them both or maybe consider swapping for the new Sigma to get that extra 4mm on the wide end. 

If anything, that’s my only complaint about it is that 28mm just doesn’t feel wide enough for me in tight spaces. But I do like it and will be taking it along with me to Germany in March."
