AskReddit,ffpnaud,t3_euii32,1580099383.0,"I copied a poem by Emily Dickinson onto a test from a paper in my pocket. It's a fucking poem, Mrs. Hedderman, not the SAT test. No wonder your kid is always asking my sister to do stuff with him, he wants an excuse to get away from you. And I have you twice in one day. You're a bitch, you hate me, I hate you, just cause I have depression and im suicidal doesn't mean im not capable of doing things without you standing right behind my chair, I have the highest reading level in your class, probably the whole school, my IQ is if not the highest, it's damn near close. I'm enrolling in online school soon because you make me dread school. You're sexist like most female teachers(Sorry for kinda stereotyping some woman teachers), The school resource officer looked at you like you're crazy cause you wanted her to ""talk"" with me when I asked you to leave me alone, im sorry I wanted to be left alone, my 15 year old dog died, im sorry I don't want you to treat me like I need special help.

TL:DR I don't like my English teacher."

AskReddit,ffpm5uc,t3_euij2e,1580098488.0,My friend on Discord jokingly asked for feet pics. But I have hardly any friends so it's not that big of a deal. Also I don't talk to women.
