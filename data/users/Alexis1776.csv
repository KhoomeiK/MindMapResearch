transalute,ffat4af,t3_esjyr3,1579743870.0,"To answer your question, thereâ€™s no regs against wearing typically female underwear. Like was pointed out earlier it would be a good idea to avoid a sports bra while youâ€™re in the field or doing any unnecessarily strenuous activities. 

Although, if yâ€™all ever drop top when itâ€™s hot outside thereâ€™s a good chance your bra will be visible."

I know damn well what Iâ€™m taking about youâ€™re just too indoctrinated to pull your head out of your own ass. Maybe if you actually took time to study sources that werenâ€™t DoD approves youâ€™d actually know something. 

But by all means keep spreading that state propaganda."
transalute,fdcakra,t1_fdc9otc,1578270402.0,"Okay if you honestly think any military ends up being a net force for good, youâ€™re a fucking idiot. Because youâ€™re obviously not getting what Iâ€™m telling you, the military is a political tool to make fucking cash. But hey have some feel good hour because you built a house that we blew up, cool I guess. 

Maybe after you shoot some people you can go patch em up. And then after killing some family meme er we can make more terrorists. And then after that we can make new osama bin laden. Who do you think put those assholes in the position to do what theyâ€™re doing? America. 

We start wars for profit. Weâ€™ve literally been doing the same shit every so many years since to 40s. Why do you think America has been in non stop conflict for 80 years? Itâ€™s certainly not to kill bad guys and squash communism. Itâ€™s never been about that and it never will be as long as boot licking idiots like you keep drinking the koolaide and circle jerking over how many poor brown people you shot last week."
transalute,fdc73li,t1_fdc53wf,1578268391.0,"You think exactly what thy want you to. Of course we donâ€™t generate revenue by shooting poor brown people. We generate it by our purchasing the shit vehicles we use (I donâ€™t care what you mechanics said I twisted an axel IN HALF driving through a pot hole) and buying bullets to shoot brown people with who we then turn around and sell guns to so they can shoot at us. 

And no Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran do not want us there, no one does. Who the fuck do you think weâ€™ve been fighting? The people of those countries."
transalute,fdc3deg,t1_fdc1nio,1578266297.0,"Sure your small experiences can vary I myself have several friends for life from the army but it wasnâ€™t worth it and neither were the benefits. I gave up 4 years of my life to it. 

And yeah the military has been about noting but generating profit since the early 1900s. Why do you think they blow insane amounts of cash for shit hmmwvs or spend hundred of millions of dollars on outdated tech that barely works. Why do you think trump just assassinated an Iranian general?? The military is nothing but a political bargaining chip now. It hasnâ€™t been about national defense for decades."

news,fd0jkvh,t1_fczqdo8,1578119750.0,Thatâ€™s why I said South American countries. America has almost double the firearms per citizen. None of the countries you listed have anywhere near that amount.
news,fczmm2t,t1_fczm5qy,1578104531.0,But that doesnâ€™t explain South American countries with no access to firearms. Which have a higher rate of violence than the US.
