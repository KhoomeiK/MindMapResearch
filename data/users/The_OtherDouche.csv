movies,ffmesmd,t1_ffmb6ix,1580053531.0,I’m jealous. They have one right next to me and it’s an absolute shithole and the most expensive one here. $11 a ticket while the best one here is $9 and has electric recliners
movies,ffk5cgj,t1_ffk4jef,1580016374.0,The director got banned from two studios because of raging over his own incompetence before being fired and replaced by people that tried their best. It’s pretty bad and I was upset because I was pretty excited for it. Many kids movies are incredible in fact they are probably the most consistent.
HuntsvilleAlabama,ffjugqb,t1_ffj2zs2,1580007270.0,I just wish we wouldn’t basically burn a whole metric fuck ton of money in an ignorance barrel for a wall. It’s mind boggling to me how anyone could be stupid enough to believe in it
HuntsvilleAlabama,ffju8q8,t1_ffj8ppc,1580007091.0,No
HuntsvilleAlabama,ffju13c,t1_ffj7oem,1580006924.0,California has a very comfortable climate for homelessness. On top of the odds of them being taken care of is much higher. Democrats have nothing to do with California being such a high cost location. Hell nashville just got listed as one of the most expensive cost of living in the US.
PS4,ffe4jo1,t1_ffe404u,1579836512.0,Jesus they short on employees
PS4,ffe3o99,t1_ffe34hl,1579835862.0,It’s a lot updates for them to not fix things.
PS4,ffe2uxf,t1_ffdeu06,1579835260.0,Imagine being this pretentious about a DBZ game
funny,ffd2059,t1_ffczzc1,1579811845.0,I got to watch someone receive my mastiff when they were trespassing on my parents land when I was a teen. They can fucking *move* when they get into stride and he was not impressed with whoever this man was. Closest I’ve ever been to watching someone’s  sheer panic. I miss that dog.
HuntsvilleAlabama,ffd0swm,t1_ffconvk,1579811174.0,She willingly left with them so who knows what the circumstances are. Never heard HWY 72 called that before either.
insanepeoplefacebook,ffbynho,t1_ffbu8wy,1579786925.0,My teacher told me it was like that. She had been to Germany.
HuntsvilleAlabama,ffbteff,t1_ffba4u3,1579782067.0,I will say the one time I ordered something off menu I got it native and wooooo boi. I love spicy but I had to get paper towels from the restroom to keep up with my nose running. Their buffet it’s incredible though
HuntsvilleAlabama,ffb5gpk,t1_ffatjrt,1579752301.0,It’ll be operational before all the buildings are complete. Realistically they are already operating out of the first building the built but I think it’s temporary. They facilities are pretty over the top huge so I could see the union having things to do for that long.
HuntsvilleAlabama,ffagobb,t1_ffa0pik,1579735318.0,It’s hard to make them as good. Also no jalapeño cheddar sliders either.
cars,ff8xulr,t1_ff8uysp,1579699584.0,Who looks at buying a new car to rag it the fuck out?
HuntsvilleAlabama,ff8uysk,t3_es000e,1579696981.0,That would make me so damn happy. I miss White Castle
HuntsvilleAlabama,ff8uipu,t3_es4j9k,1579696545.0,It’s the Facebook center. I’ve been back there to do some work. They are building three massive buildings. Union member said they’ll be there ~6-7 years.
cars,ff8u6jr,t1_ff8c2aq,1579696210.0,Ahh yes my most important metric of how fast I can tell people my car is while I’m stuck in traffic. Good luck with those teenage years bud.
cars,ff886na,t1_ff6pwb9,1579668798.0,I have an 84 Datsun pickup. Fucking loved that truck. Would have probably kept it as my daily too if I have the know how to replace the fuse box since the AC fuse melted in place. So cheap to work on too.
cars,ff880dp,t1_ff7w8qo,1579668645.0,I don’t understand the point of trying to pretend cars are financial investments. You will 100% lose money. I guess maybe damage control but i would never consider a car more than just an expense.
cars,ff87u5q,t1_ff7nbpo,1579668495.0,If you refer to civics as shitty Japanese cars you could have just started with that so everyone would have known you aren’t worth talking to.
mildlyinteresting,ff86mxh,t1_ff85prs,1579667478.0,I’m super fascinated by their machines. Google is currently installing it county wide around me right now and I see those machines every single day for the past two years
mildlyinteresting,ff86jfn,t1_ff7rpre,1579667394.0,Oh I know. We even had the shit marked when I replaced someone’s sewer last year which means hand dig only. I went to break the patch of sod off the yard with my first dig and broke two lines.
PublicFreakout,ff47z8w,t1_ff4473x,1579557520.0,It was assault but he is obviously a minor. He is definitely not competent enough to be a wrestler though.
PublicFreakout,ff47u3s,t1_ff4251c,1579557431.0,If you intentionally try to injure someone while playing a sport even if “in the heat of the moment” you shouldn’t participate. Hell if at 17 you can’t even keep yourself from doing dangerous shit because you get caught up in the “heat of the moment” you should hang it up because you are wasting everyone’s time because you obviously can’t be trained out of it.
PublicFreakout,ff47goq,t1_ff42vkk,1579557205.0,Suplex is still illegal. Unless he thought he could tuck the guys legs and put him on his stomach which seems pretty ridiculous
PublicFreakout,ff41xt3,t1_ff41m53,1579553771.0,If it was a purposeful move? Absolutely he should be barred. Head injury isn’t a trivial matter it would have absolutely ruined the victims life entirely.
PublicFreakout,ff419jr,t1_ff412yq,1579553353.0,Probably not arrested but he should have be barred from competing again. Match should have been called on the spot.
HuntsvilleAlabama,ff40v6r,t1_ff3zsmb,1579553105.0,I guess it’s unfair to not include I only signed 6 month term. It was only a $20 more a month increase though
movies,ff2cd77,t1_ff2af0o,1579500547.0,I mean you also had to dial it in and have responsibilities. Leo could do fuck all for a decade and still have every bill accounted for. He can wild out with the young ones because he has as little responsibility as them. Which by no means am I implying that as a bad thing. If I were wealthy I’d spend months away from home although it would prob be to take my family to see things.
movies,ff2c84z,t1_ff29g42,1579500404.0,It really is. Radicals spend all their time arguing with normal ass people on Twitter. In reddit they make a community to fester inside of.
HuntsvilleAlabama,ff0wbqh,t1_ff0q3al,1579472881.0,That’s pretty lame
HuntsvilleAlabama,ff0n4dj,t1_fezs07b,1579470448.0,I wish someone’s would try it and let me know too. Don’t feel like throwing $17 at a pizza to feel meh about
HuntsvilleAlabama,fez6fr6,t1_feyuwyw,1579454279.0,I’ll try and find them again to check
HuntsvilleAlabama,feysa66,t1_feycbn6,1579449983.0,The FB comments seem to indicate its a female player
HuntsvilleAlabama,fewjnd8,t1_few916u,1579411987.0,I’d like to update you that she was not eligible due to joining the school year late it seems. Transferred schools and joined mid season is what the FB comments seem to be saying which I guess means something in sports.
HuntsvilleAlabama,fewhzjc,t1_fevxcu9,1579410917.0,It’s 25 miles away
HuntsvilleAlabama,fevx3mk,t1_fev7pty,1579402576.0,They’ll hold back high school graduation over a single penny of it so I wouldn’t put past them. This is from Lincoln county though so it may differ.
HuntsvilleAlabama,fev7cdo,t1_fetjsf3,1579394004.0,You 100% aren’t allowed to graduate. Some schools will hold you back a grade.
funny,fetc81d,t1_fesd53g,1579373815.0,If y’all have a rural king they have a in store brand one for like $15
HuntsvilleAlabama,ferlbiu,t3_eqgakz,1579355390.0,Right I got the page shared with me yesterday. I’m a little skeptical but I hope so. I love zoos.
HuntsvilleAlabama,fep1icw,t3_eq8ru4,1579310043.0,Mine went from ~820 to 920
HuntsvilleAlabama,feolcna,t1_fend8a0,1579301775.0,The majority of its office. The building with the huge parking lot in front has offices. It’s where their slogan “play where you work” came from.
HuntsvilleAlabama,feh0wqk,t1_feh0lbi,1579106822.0,"I’ll just be able to permit work under my own name then, or be able to just start my own company if I’d like. I’m not 100% on my future plans. Could get a job offer for a nice security clearanced maintenance job and ride that to the sunset."
HuntsvilleAlabama,fegxaq1,t1_fegoaqv,1579104602.0,"I find it fairly hard to believe that Kevin came out there. It’s as equally difficult to find Hyde as the “worst construction”. Their three trades (plumbing, HVAC, electrical) are subbed to pretty great companies. They’ve been one of a very few local builders for a while. They are actively doing hundreds of homes a year. These are not symptoms of a failing builder. They don’t have a national chain as back up for their finances. An issue you are describing would end a company their size. You can’t seem the elaborate on a single issue even though I’m asking as a middle man who could even provide answers to your issues. I have nothing to gain from either side but just wanted to try and be helpful. I know the problems they have and even knowing your subdivision name would clarify the obvious ones."
