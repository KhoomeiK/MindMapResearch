AskReddit,ffgic3e,t3_et0asi,1579906893.0,"Went out on one date with this girl and there was no spark, so we never went out again. I thought we parted amicably. Ran into her a few weeks later at the local bowling alley. She was there with her family but spent the whole evening trying to hang out with me and I told her I wasn't interested. Her parents came over to tell her it was time to go home when she introduces me as Morbido, the boy who tried to rape her 3 weeks ago. I go stark fucking white but before I can say anything her mother slaps her, hard, across the face and says ""Goddammit, we are not starting any of that shit again!"" Her dad just shrugs and says sorry and they leave. We have some mutual acquaintances that fill me in later that she has accused several guys of raping her when they don't want to see her anymore. Still makes my pulse race thinking about it 35 years later."

For the most part our ""potential sex partners"" were people we dated first, I mean it was the 80's and we had our share of 1 night stands, but they were actually pretty rare. Myself, I think people have a right to be who they need to be, straight, gay, trans, whatever. Just be happy. As for this particular question, I think the trans person should come clean as soon as they are asked out. Definitely before ANY physical contact, even so much as a kiss. Some guy might flip out 'cause he asked out a trans, but he'll flip out even worse if the trans person had their tongue in his mouth.
