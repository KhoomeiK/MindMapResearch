depression,fefrark,t3_cml6ni,1579062923.0,"I've been feeling worse than ever. A couple of days ago my friend tried to commit suicide but luckily I stopped it by getting the attention of their sister. But after that everything has gotten like 10x worse. My eating habits are really bad (I eat 1 meal a day), I've been trying to hurt myself way more than usual, and I've trying my best to just emotionally and physically hurt myself. I've stopped being social with my friends and my social anxiety has come back which is great. Also, my sleep schedule has gone to crap to the point I sleep in my classes. I wanna tell people but I'm scared that I'm not even depressed and I'm just doing this all for attention so what's the point."
