That said, if you're looking for a morality system like Fallout or Mass Effect, the game doesn't really have that. Your choices can have MASSIVE consequences to the story, but there aren't any game mechanics telling you whether you're being a good or bad person.

If you escape a gatecamp right next to your system, bail and do it another time. Learn the mwd cloak trick if you're using a T1, and always keep an eye on dscan and local.

todayilearned,fds9c8n,t1_fds6dpa,1578697342.0,"Never played AC but the freeform character thing reminded me a lot of Star Wars Galaxies. In the older versions of the game, you were basically dumped into the world with nothing and told to do whatever you felt like. Each action generated a specific type of XP. For instance, skinning an animal would generate scout xp, which was one of the starter professions. Once you got enough of scout xp, you could spend the xp and some credits to buy a new skill in the tree. Those eventually branched off into the advanced trees, which were like specialized versions of the starter trees. Cool thing was you could mix and match skills however you felt like. You had 150 (I think) sp to spend, and as long as you met the specific xp requirements you could spend them on whatever you wanted.

My GF was babysitting them and found a loaded revolver under the cushion of the rocking chair she was sitting on.

I've had a few kills where I didn't even get a hitmarker, always from long range. Seems the game doesn't always understand what you're aiming at if you're far away."
television,fdchq0r,t1_fdbwdnd,1578275181.0,"Yeah, that was the biggest point that bothered me. Like you said, Geralt and the mages looking the same makes sense, but IIRC Jaskier mentions at some point that he'd know Geralt for near a decade, which threw me way off, because Jaskier still looked exactly the same."
television,fdchcaq,t1_fdc2gcr,1578274910.0,The song in general also fits well since Witchers are so hated and distrusted by the time Geralt's story starts. Seems like they get run out of towns after killing the local monsters more often than they actually get paid for it.
television,fdcgr9k,t1_fdbuq6r,1578274501.0,"IIRC the exact extents of his extra mutation aren't really explained, but we can kind of extrapolate based on his abilities. Geralt is one of the most renowned Witchers in record, so if nothing else we can assume his extra mutations further enhanced his strength, stamina, and especially his reaction time. Even among Witchers, Geralt is a martial force to be reckoned with, which lends to the idea that he is physically superior even to normal Witchers."
RedDeadOnline,fdcdxo3,t1_fdcdkid,1578272539.0,"I've been kinda doing the same thing. Notice myself using a single revolver more since i got the navy, and only pulling the second one out when I need it. Feels badass whipping the foot long revolver around one handed and hearing the big bang every time I fire lol."
RedDeadOnline,fdccc9f,t1_fd9vhgk,1578271485.0,"When you can do it, I'd recommend getting bounty hunter up the the level where you get the eagle eye upgrade. being able to use it while moving is a game changer. Plus you get some other cool toys on the way there."
RedDeadOnline,fdcbtoz,t1_fdby3tq,1578271171.0,"I've been running one navy and one schofield for dual wield until I buy my second navy. Navy hits harder and seems more accurate imo, but the Schof reloads MUCH faster. They're both good options from what I can tell."
cars,fdc2pzo,t1_fdbp0za,1578265928.0,"If it's under warranty, I'd say just eat the lost day and get it fixed by a pro. If you try to fix it yourself, you may misdiagnose and replace the wrong part, having to eat the cost. If the shop misdiagnoses it under warranty they get to eat the cost and fix it right the second time."

I wonder if she remembers much of the time between like 1910 and 1930 at this point. I cant even imagine having memories of something that long ago."
RedDeadOnline,fcpd2gs,t1_fcnwovu,1577858883.0,"I wasn't riding at them with my gun out shooting. I was riding at them with my lasso in hand but not swinging. I've also been killed by dick wagon drivers who just shoot everyone while I was sitting in my camp. Having a wagon doesn't just give you free reign to kill everyone around you without repercussion. If you shoot someone, expect to get shot back."
RedDeadOnline,fcjw93c,t1_fcdupbw,1577707774.0,Will try the goat method. Perhaps the gods will see fit to imbue my pc with holy power.
RedDeadOnline,fcjw7o8,t1_fcggnjf,1577707723.0,"No, I was chasing a deer actually. You probly use your wagons as an excuse to be a griefer and shoot everyone you come across. See how easy that is?"
RedDeadOnline,fcdm9th,t1_fcd26cy,1577611369.0,"Not seeing any errors there. I also can't see to replicate the issue in any other game besides GTAO, which is weird. I would think if my gpu was having issues it would show up in other game that use it heavily."
RedDeadOnline,fcd1c78,t1_fcczjeq,1577605139.0,"Yeah, doesn't seem to help. Thanks for the input!"
RedDeadOnline,fccpe25,t1_fccocnw,1577601071.0,"I usually do have chrome running while I play, so lemme give it a shot without that and see how it behaves. I'm not sold on it being a memory issue, since I seem to have at most 50% memory usage most of the time the game is running, but I have had issues with other games while running Chrome which I didn't think of until now.

Thanks for the input!

EDIT: Eliminated browsers. Still had the issue. I'm not convinced it isn't tied to the GPU usage in some way. The usage stats ONLY tank when the fps issues crop up. Almost makes me think the game just stops sending calls to the GPU randomly or something. Gonna continue pruning my list of normally running apps to rule them out.

Edit 2: In the process of messing around I've launched GTAO for the first time since RDR2 came out, and I'm have the same issue there, though not quite as severe. The game randomly freezes and my GPU basically turns off. Tried multiple other non R* game and could not replicate it in those. Interesting."
RedDeadOnline,fccms23,t1_fcclpg0,1577600211.0,I can totally understand that sentiment. Just seems that in my experience there are more people around who just want to be left alone than not. Good luck in your deliveries man!
RedDeadOnline,fccklv6,t1_fccjnpt,1577599482.0,"TBH I usually just have the gun out because I'm hunting. Like I said though, it's kinda the same choice. I could think to put my weapon away when passing you, and you could choose not to shoot me when I haven't even aimed at you (all hypothetical of course). To me though, once someone opens fire on me, that's just inviting to get shot at back. That's why I don't shoot at people passing me with weapons drawn when I'm driving my wagon. They haven't actually done anything to me. 

Maybe give it a shot for a few runs. As I mentioned, I've had very very little trouble running goods using this method, and personally the only time I'll attack a wagon is if they attack me first. Might work out and make your runs a little easier :)"

RedDeadOnline,fcchsso,t1_fccgrcy,1577598547.0,"I can ride down the road with a gun drawn same as you can ride down the road with one drawn. I'm not complaining about getting shot, just saying that if you shoot me first you're gonna get shots back. FWIW, I don't shoot first on delivery missions and almost never get bothered. IMO you make more enemies by shooting first, and if someone really wants to fuck with you they're just gonna pull out a rifle with explosive rounds and blow up your wagon from a mile away anyway."
