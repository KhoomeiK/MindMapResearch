The reason they also want karma (the people buying these) is so they can post to subreddits with a minimum karma amount and also so they can post «ads» that arent really ads and more a «hey guys check out this [] its pretty cool» and you check their profile: normal username, high karma (pretty much means more trustable), lots of activity and high karma (re)posts"

ShouldIbuythisgame,fdc0ora,t1_fdat5x7,1578264852.0,"Theyre both good games (1k hours warframe 500h destiny) but the gameplay is vastly different, and destiny has alot more variety in endgame. 

The whole gameplay loop of warframe is grind for this grind for that, which is great for people who love to grind and get new powerful stuff although it can get old quite fast especially if its something boring with low drop rate (looking at you nidus)

In destiny, you have raids which are not just based on your dmg but require mechanical skill more than «build» skill. PvP is also a thing, in warframe its nonexistent outside of events (for a good reason) I have been seeing alot of people complaining about the armor grind though because of the bad droprates and since i havent played in a while im not sure if its necessary or just minmax

To add i still love warframe because of their dev team and ambition, but i feel like the people who compare them are the same who compare GoT to Witcher"

I didnt notice too much of a difference from the rpgs ive played so i cant speak on the whole JRPG side of things.

It can be grindy if you dont get the parts you need right away but that grind is very fun especially if you try a new weapon while doing it.

There are 14 different weapons each with their own unique playstyle, ranging from hack and slash to 63 combos.

As for multiplayer, there are sos flares where you can join randoms or they can join you and people usually will join. However you can play the entire game solo aside from a couple missions where it scales to 4 players but thats endgame content and not necessary

All in all its a good game and i loved it.
