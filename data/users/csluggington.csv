AskReddit,fdm9q48,t3_elssvy,1578543342.0,"When I was a kid...I wouldn't clean my room and left old food and trash in my room. I would hide food I didn't want to eat so ...obviously...it got moldy. I used to think mold was the same word as mole. My parents would say ""Mold is gonna start growing, clean your room!"" I thought the animal known as a mole would grow from leaving food for too long. The mold would get fuzzy like an animal and eventually I would hear something rustling around under my bed and that confirmed that a mole grew and is now running around my room. Lol Idk how long I believed that. I would see mice and think ""That's a mole."""

bujo,fckbg9a,t3_ehkkcy,1577721542.0,"I prefer dotted over anything else. If anything blank pages are the worst. In my opinion anyways. I used a blank journal for my first journal and it was a mistake. Everything was sloppy and I ended up just throwing it away when I was ""finished"". I got halfway thru the blank one and decided to buy a dotted one. Lol"
bujo,fbztawu,t3_ef6bzq,1577260403.0,Such a great idea. I'm definitely going to use this. Thanks!
