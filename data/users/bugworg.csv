The VA by me NOW is fucking horrible.  Pretty much useless because meds and appointments and all sorts of shit would just not happen.  Lost.. and you didn't know when.  There is no way they don't kill people regularly.  If they're not getting me my meds what do you think happens to SSGT stubbs and his heart meds?  


I have regular insurance that's supposed to be very good.  Every time I use it people tell me or my wife how good our insurance is.   We go to one of the best hospitals in the country.  


I'd rather have a good VA.  Navigating my insurance is way too hard,  even though it's ""good"" I never know what bills will be paid.  I have to provide documentation to my FSA.  My primary care doctor even referred me to the VA as they were legitimately the experts on a few of my issues and she thinks highly of the doctors there.

  
I ended up getting specialist appointments with civilians on my own because I just could not bring myself to deal with the fucking va again, seeing hallways full of one armed, one legged, one eyed vets who are old men, having lived most of their lives in the system.   No particular place to go, sitting pointlessly wherever someone left them.   Probably they'll stay there all day until chow or their next appointment."
lostgeneration,fekdk0j,t1_fek1ddd,1579197799.0,"I don't know how cop training works but I've had probably similar training.   I was trained to shoot to disable with no regard for if they lived or died.   The gun was always a last resort and we were supposed to use an asp or pepper spray or fists to take the fight out of people.   
The fists and asps were presented as potentially deadly weapons as well.  I don't remember much but I do remember stuff like whacking someone's leg right would hurt like hell and probably take the fight out of most people without serious harm.   


There were also a bunch of models and lists made up of triangles, boxes, and flow charts that were supposed to help us decide the correct amount of force.   It was cheesy and it sounds cheesy but the distressing thing is that I watch police in real life and on the news and often they're nowhere near close to what would have been considered right for the amount of force they're using.  So for use it must have worked.

I can tell you we took this training seriously even if we were laughing and joking.   To us it was important to know what to do without spending a lot of time weighing judgements and morals.   We were all aware that we might have to live with to consequences of killing someone who doesn't deserve it or getting a friend killed because we froze up.   
I see less and less of that kind of professionalism from law enforcement all the time.  I remember I signed up for a law enforcement forum because I knew it was a possible career path at a time that I needed a job.    I was banned for arguing with the senior members and most of the guys seemed to have been taught something totally different than what I got.   I have to wonder if a lot of training programs are run by guys with fake military credentials.    As far as I know it was fairly standard training and I had no problem finding slides and stuff from the LEO community that related directly to what I was taught so at least some cops are getting trained properly somewhere.

I It certainly seems like there is a large community of supposed expert badasses who never served when I look at social media,  I have to wonder how many of them offer classes to the police."

There are a lot of other very impractical benefits that I get.  Some of the medical benefits take so much work to use that for higher salaried employees using the benefits costs more in time that just paying cash.

They paid for a smoking cessation program that was supposed to give out free patches.   They told me that since it was covered by my insurance I should make an appointment with my primary care doctor, have her write a prescription and then get the prescription filled.   I think primary care appointments have a $20 copay plus 15 minutes to make the appointment, 2 hours to get there, go to the appointment, and get back.   Then another 20 minutes dealing with the pharmacy.   The real cost to me was well over $100 and so I spent that much on bulk patches online.  Just buying them online took maybe 5 minutes!  


  
Of course these people already wasted a bunch of my time getting me to sign up, make a login and a bunch of other pointless crap, pick a delivery date for my patches.   Then I waited until the were 2 weeks late and called them, was on hold forever, they had to take my number and call me back and let me know that I don't actually qualify for patches directly because I can use my insurance to get ""free"" patches anyhow.

For example if you snitch on people for smoking pot you will be hated, you will not survive.  But if someone pops they are often given deals if they snitch on enough people.   I saw a former cop, with a family, hardass worker and dependable... he was given an OTH discharge for KNOWING that someone had smoked pot despite never doing it himself.  


One of the biggest motivators for me to get out was to collect my honorable discharge while I still could.  A few months later almost my entire division was kicked out.  My chief asked me for 6 more months as a personal favor and I told him no.  I don't know how extensions work but I am under the impression that they're an extension of your original contract.  It hurt me to say no to him but I think I would have lost my GI bill if I'd helped him out.     


The worst part was I had showed the snitch how to smoke weed and pass every time as long as he followed the rules.  He also knew that we could get his sample tossed if it was an emergency... an option he apparently decided not to explore.   But I'm sure that NCIS would have loved to hammer my ass as some sort of mastermind.

I had a few things to be proud of but most of them have turned out badly in the time since I got out.  The only thing I still feel solid proud of is some rescue work but I expect any day now to learn I saved the antichrist.  


So that's why it feels weird to us to thank us.  If americans really gave a shit they'd be seeking vets for quality employment.  Instead employers love fresh vets because you can work the shit out of them, I deal with few other vets at this stage of my career.  
If americans really wanted to thank us for our service they'd stop making cutbacks at the VA.   The post 9/11 GI bill would get additional funding instead of being restructured to save cash.

Our school system is a disaster and the majority of people who talk about manners or respect are just fishing for reasons to push their will on others.  I'm fucking tired of it and want it to become socially unacceptable by the time I'm dead.

1) My interest in taking care of kids is completely selfish.
Look at it this way.  If we allow a kid to starve when we could feed him in school he will grow up with an IQ of wet shit and will end up committing crimes, mooching welfare, and beating/starving his own shitty little kids.   

2) The manners I see promoted the most have very little to do with a functioning society.  They're more about identifying tribes so you know who is ok to fuck with.   I'll know society gives a fuck about manners when I can walk more than a few blocks without some jackass standing where people are obviously trying to walk.  Until then I'm putting my elbows on the table and wearing my hat inside grandma.

3) I think that we have plenty of time to teach math and science but we teach badly. k12 is not hard, it is boring as fuck and wastes a ton of time worrying about hats, coats, exposed shoulders, who farted, cell phones, etc.  When I was in school the principal was obsessed with gangs but it was actually difficult to track down a dime bag of weed because the school was so removed from legitimate organized crime of any kind.   

School is a good place for nazis to hang out when they're too fat for law enforcement and not politically fashionable at the moment."
