If the left is using Pakistani terminolog to describe their territory, India lost Kashmir. I was never more disappointed in being Indian. I swore of saying anything related to Kashmir there"

But it’s fine, as with anything to do with Kashmir lots of propaganda and fake news/sensationalism. Plus since I am a Kashmiri Pandit  thay lived in the valley, people automatically hate me because my community is used a tool for political battles. I am not going to share anything with Kashmir here anymore."

This was circulated In the Pakistani subreddits earlier. Probably to further their agenda, but the armed forces are pretty friendly in Srinagar and will help you if you need be. Areas are usually closed of near encounter areas to prevent militants from being assisted or to escape. Bad apples exist and they should be rooted out, but don’t malign the armed forces in general."
