I don’t get this whole, “I don’t owe anything” movement. We should be humanizing and respecting one another because we can and it’s the right thing to do. 

It isn’t about closure, it’s about maturity. Adults, particularly ones in real relationships, have to have uncomfortable conversations from time to time. Showing you’re grown enough to have them (or not) - regardless of the other person’s potential reaction - speaks volumes."

If I’m speaking to someone really regularly and we’re making plans when he suddenly disappears, I actually begin to worry. Not about it not being a match - I don’t care, there are plenty of dudes out there - but that something may have happened to him. 

I would much rather a person be upfront, as I am.

Not everyone will click or have conversational chemistry/flow. Hell, my mannerisms once reminded a guy of his sister. I don’t want that!

AskReddit,ff57ygx,t3_ergjyj,1579582886.0,"Worked at a bookstore and a woman was having problems with her e-reader. She was well-known for being a challenge, so I asked the team call me out the next time she came in (I love challenging customers and everyone hated this chick).

She was on her cell with tech support, standing in the front of the store, yelling. I eventually convinced her to pick the store or the phone, then escorted her to a computer in a secluded part of the store. 

I’m going through the process of fixing the issue and she’s all wound up from the phone support line. She’s still yelling, definitely cognizant she’s making a scene. 

A fraction short of threatening, I cut her off completely. Said, I get she’s unsatisfied with the support line, but I’m helping now. Gave her the option to take it down to a reasonable volume while I fixed the problem or she could leave the store and phone them back.

There’s no way to convey how grating this lady was, but I rarely lose my cool. Was real close to losing my shit!

raisedbynarcissists,feftdg3,t3_eooitr,1579064610.0,"The the #1 lesson I’ve taken away from having a nparent - everyone has been through and is going through something. And, it’s not a contest. 

There is no such thing as a fair comparison. 

A person who grows up with a supportive family may only know the loss of their family dog. If that’s the worst thing he or she has experienced, it’s the only metric he or she has for understanding loss. That shouldn’t be diminished. 

Another person may have lost his or her entire family, witnessed death, lived on the street. These are things an independent, third party could agree are worse, yet if these are the worst experiences a person knows, it’s the same bar as the first person with losing a dog. 

We relate based on experience and situational understanding, but it’s all subjective. 

My friend doesn’t need to understand what it’s like to have a nparent to empathize or sympathize with the situation. She’ll never understand what it’s like and I’m happy for that! I will never know what it’s like to have anything else and maybe it’s good not to know what I’m missing. 

We all have the opportunity to have empathy, be supportive of, and to validate the emotions of others. 

No one need be left to question if his or her feelings are valid, regardless the severity of the situation. The first person who has to validate and allow you to have emotions or feelings will always be you. Don’t forget to humanize yourself!"
