In a Lord of the Flies environment, I can say ""it's WRONG for you to beat me to a bloody pulp"" and I can HOPE that I can therefore persuade my aggressor not to attack me (or persuade others to help me), but the reality is that if my persuasion doesn't work on the people around me then I'm left to physically defend myself and that's all I have.

But when a Moop tries to tell the police he ""does not consent"" to being arrested, is he actually trying to persuade the police officer that what the officer is doing is *morally* wrong? I don't think so, I think he's trying to persuade the police officer that what the officer is doing is *legally* wrong, which has nothing to do with any lofty ethical arguments like policing by consent. The Moop believes, wrongly, that the law is actually on their side and if they say the right words in the right order then the police or the courts will be legally required to do what the Moop wants regardless of right or wrong."
