tarantulas,ffcxf3y,t3_eshvo8,1579809271.0,"Check out Tom Moran on YouTube, I love watching his rehousings before doing my own. They usually reassure me that things are more than likely going to go smoothly.

That said, I’d recommend just putting a clear deli cup over her and taking her completely out of the enclosure so you can work. Put some kind of hole in the end of the cup just big enough to poke a straw or something similar size into so you can prod her out of the cup"

reptiles,ff9z0an,t1_ff8o0v4,1579724537.0,"US pet stores have misinformation, but they would never mislabel an eastern as an indo. I worked in a specialty reptile shop for a good amount of time. Even we never got easterns because of how expensive they would be. Indo's are fairly cheap and plentiful in the US compared to any australian species. If you want an eastern here, you pretty much have to either order one online or get lucky at a show. OP said they bought it at a pet shop labeled as an indo. It's an indo. If OP somehow managed to accidentally get sold an eastern, they should buy a lotto ticket right now. 

here's an indo that looks almost exactly like OP's. https://www.lllreptile.com/uploads/images/StoreInventoryImage/16083/large"

reptiles,ff8lb0w,t1_ff8ke06,1579684052.0,"so first, if going by color were a reliable way to sex blueys, people wouldnt be constantly unsure of their skinks sex. Also, by your logic then that would be a male skink because in an older post you can clearly see that it has orange-ish eyes (a trait common among indos)

next, i would be willing to put down an unreasonable amount of money that OP has an indo for a few reasons

1. They're in the states. Easterns are stupid hard to find here in america. when you do find them, they're very expensive and the people buying them know exactly what they're buying. They wouldnt be asking on reddit what kind of skink they have. 

2. It was labeled as an indo. Pet stores can be dumb, but i've never heard of one being dumb enough to mix up an indo and an easters, two very easy to distinguish skink species

3. It was bought in a pet store. Nearly every eastern in america that is sold, is done so through a breeder. Finding one at a pet shop would be incredibly uncommon. 

4. the pattern. the skink pictured completely lacks the eastern's trademark ""mask"" pattern on its face. There's no visible orange on its sides in an older post as well, which many easterns typically have"
reptiles,ff8k37w,t1_ff8k03e,1579682226.0,How are you so sure that their skink is a female lol. Blueys are pretty well known to not be sexually dimorphic.

tarantulas,feme20s,t3_epwp07,1579250688.0,"Definitely not true lol. 

Enclosures- honestly if you go for sterilite enclosures, you probably won’t spend more than ten dollars on an enclosure, even for adults. Obviously you can get something nice and that can cost more, but even then it’s not expensive at all.

Heat- unless your home/room is below like, 65f (18c) you shouldn’t need any heat source. Tarantulas are very comfortable at room temp

Diseases- unless you buy a wild caught t, you shouldn’t have any risk of diseases such as nematodes. DKS is another possibility but I believe that’s fairly rare. 

I’ve kept a lot of pets from fish, to lizards, snakes, cats, dogs, chickens, and hermit crabs. My tarantulas are the cheapest and easiest to care for pet that I have."

A question about the handle, I think it might be the original so I’d obviously like to keep the two together. It’s looking a little rough, but really not bad, so I was curious if I should sand it lightly before oiling it."

She should be okay if you put in a cricket and leave it overnight. Usually the only time you should be careful is if she molts and they chew on her while she’s soft. I usually just take stuff out immediately if they don’t seem interested because I have lizards that are more than happy to take the uneaten crickets. If she is starting to show adult colors you can move to once a week or so, that’s what I have mine on and they do great."

You can toss the sponge as they don’t do anything other than harbor bacteria. Tarantulas wont drown if there’s no sponge. Unless your house gets under 60, I really wouldn’t recommend a light or heat mat at all. I’d recommend you take the rock out as well in case she decides to climb and falls on it which could rupture her abdomen. Plastic plants can make nice anchor points for webbing, but since this genus doesn’t web much it’s not a necessity.

If you have imgur you can use that to get a link, or if you have discord we could just move over there."
