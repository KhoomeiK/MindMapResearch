zelda,ff9h6tx,t1_ff9fnof,1579712939.0,"Exactly this; I never felt connected to an NPC community as in this game because you have to interact with and help *everyone* in order to win. There is significance to everyone's life in that game, so it felt like the world is truly worth saving.

In contrast, Skyward Sword could have been stellar if it offered more connection to its characters, but it's rather a mostly empty expanse. Honestly same with BotW for me personally (I know; blasphemy). I didn't feel compelled to save the world despite all the cutscenes."
