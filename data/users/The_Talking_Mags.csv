datingoverthirty,ff400mf,t1_ff3y9bh,1579552574.0,"Hmmm I wouldn’t mention it at all. 

So I have a couple of shitty tattoos, that I got when I was a teenager, and a bit of a tummy, that I can cover up when in clothes but is pretty obvious when naked. I hide all of these with good clothing and shoes (one tattoo is on my foot). 

I don’t mention them at all before naked time because of differing reasons 

1) we all have things that other people don’t like about our bodies. I’ve had men look at my tattoos and tummy and grimace, why did I need to warn them prior exactly? I have friends whose boobs are incredibly saggy. They look like they’ve lost a lot of weight, but they haven’t, potentially just not much elastin in their skin? They wear push-up bras and look great in clothes. I’ve never heard of them mentioning droopy boobs before sexy time.

2) the person you’re going to get freaky with, their body isn’t perfect either.

3) I feel like everyone wants a list of pros and cons to their dates, instead of actually dating them. You do not owe anyone a list of your bad shit so they can opt out early. You’re supposed to get to know one another. Maybe you won’t like something about them before your clothes ever come off. 

Good luck and well done on the weight loss."
