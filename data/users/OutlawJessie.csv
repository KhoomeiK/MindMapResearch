interestingasfuck,ffls37u,t1_ffloihd,1580043366.0,"We had to submit every symptom of colds/flu when one of them was here, you went to a website and answered questions and they decided if you had it based on your answers, I didn't think I had it but I followed suggested protocol and filled in the form, pretty sure I just had a cold, but it deemed me to be infected and gave me a code and time to go get treatment from some isolation clinic, at the chemist out of hours I think, tamiflu? did anyone else do this or remember this happening? Anyway, I didn't go, didn't need to, but it was interesting considering those figures were probably reported as another active case."

MadeMeSmile,ffl2zmj,t1_ffkrjt4,1580033857.0,"Well, my dog hurt her foot and since September I've put on 3 pounds and I think that's entirely because we're doing short little 15 minute walks and not the usual 45 minutes round the big park. The dog looks a bit chunkier too, nothing changed in our eating habits. Maybe exercise is our key?"

We'd prefer to say we're citizens of the world, we don't have strong feelings for our countries, when you've been to enough places you can see there's good and bad everywhere, the same types of people exist in every country, but some have better living and working conditions than others at our financial level."
