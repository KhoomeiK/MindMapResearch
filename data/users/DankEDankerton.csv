AskReddit,ffmtvbp,t3_eu6iol,1580058829.0,Chubby Asians. I hadn’t ever seen a chubby Asian and literally every option was porn.

Art,ffex8mk,t1_ffesay3,1579869180.0,You thought you could enjoy a piece of work without knowing it’s traced? No way we’re gonna downvote you for no reason.
Art,ffex2rl,t1_ffeiezs,1579869017.0,Imagine getting downvoted for enjoying what you though was a genuinely created piece of art.
HistoryMemes,ffep3s3,t1_ffeoqju,1579858335.0,"It was an elder scrolls joke. On a serious note, how will such taxes generate enough money to make 1000 dollars a month viable? That’s 200 billion a month. I think, my math may be wrong. There are 200 million working age adults in the US. How will we tax companies and corporations to a reasonable degree to generate THAT much money."
gonewild,ffel5ow,t3_et30c9,1579852677.0,Theres a piece of lint on your knob.
HistoryMemes,ffekp6c,t1_ffekllv,1579852088.0,My silly mind saw peace dividend and thought of Yang. Freedom dividend is incredibly similar. Surely there is some meme material with him though. Make one!
HistoryMemes,ffekhwg,t3_et73ww,1579851828.0,A thousand dollars a month sounds fantastic. Lets hope his conjuration skill is as good as his speech skill. LMAO

gunpolitics,fevxiqx,t1_fevw0nv,1579402755.0,Seemed as though it was implied. The top comment is quite ambiguous. I shouldn’t have called you retarded though. I apologize.
gunpolitics,fevvnl9,t1_fevozfy,1579401993.0,Are you fucking retarded. Read the rest of the thread.

gunpolitics,fevjkm4,t1_feviiag,1579398132.0,I’m not a fucking NPC. Saying “heh black peoples bad” isn’t a fact. I am not disagreeing that the majority of crime is done by those of quote “minority status.” What I am saying is there is WAY more to it than them being black or brown or whatever. I’m not running a shame program. Fuck you.

sadcringe,fetsqfe,t1_fetbk2r,1579379621.0,Pewdiepies comment section is ass nowadays. No one says anything relevant to the video and when they rarely do they put in like three meme formats. It’s really fucking annoying.
TheRightCantMeme,fepe25a,t1_fepd01n,1579318210.0,Not a big deal. Clearly a lot of people didn’t understand my comment.
TheRightCantMeme,fepcpmi,t1_fepaz2g,1579317295.0,"My guy...... I hope you’re joking. Disregard the following if you are. How would you know my political affiliations from a two word comment? And secondly, relax!"
TheRightCantMeme,fepboit,t1_fepbion,1579316601.0,Yeah. I was using gay in the literal meaning. I never use gay as a pejorative anymore. Synonymous with lame.

TheRightCantMeme,fde3rgz,t1_fde3dtm,1578330526.0,"I guess you’re right. But what I meant was that when trying to represent a whole (like left or right, which I think the whole concept is kind of stupid and we should discuss issues on a per issue base rather than opposite of what my “enemy” thinks) it’s silly to choose a single person and take there word as gospel. There are many stupid people to point to. Like Rush. Or that one person with 15k twitter followers, probably."
TheRightCantMeme,fde2kbh,t1_fddru0x,1578329752.0,I mean someone above chose one quote from Rush Limbaugh to make there point. Granted that’s not really cherry picking. I’m saying giving an example from a single person is not the smartest idea to make your point.
JustBootThings,fdaayro,t1_fd95wm8,1578243903.0,Litre bike or no bike. Start with a 300 or 600?! What is that pussy shit!

Maine,fciyiqn,t1_fcixan8,1577672887.0,But it’s will be going next to existing power lines and won’t harm a thing! According to the ad. It doesn’t help us Mainers in any way so.
