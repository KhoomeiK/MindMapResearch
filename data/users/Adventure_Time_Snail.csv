There was some issue with getting blocked by cops and some intense musical performances. But wild seeing that many trans people in one crowd. Met my bowie look a like friend there.

For non binary relationships Theyfriend for lovers, folks for groups. My family is a chosen family so kin. Queer Language is a root of a lot of new words and its pretty, well, queer. A little weird, a little mystical, I love it. 

with my friends its mostly girls and we use feminine terms like babes, hon, stuff in other languages. I guess for a stranger id just prefer to be addressed in the way youd greet a woman you just met.

In my experience terms like that (dude, mate, bro) are only gender neutral when you are trying to treat someone in a non sexual or non maternal way - like a friend. As soon as femininity is associated through Sexuality or maternal roles then the gender neutral term isn't so neutral. Basically everyone's your dude/dicke/mate/bro except for Madonna and the whore. Which is deeply gendered."
AreTheStraightsOK,fee9atc,t1_fee4ppn,1579029055.0,"I mean only if you date gay ppl. Straights are a minefield even if they date someone who is bi they are often still homophobes when they are confronted with same gender gays and diminishing of other gendered gays. For example Straight men who date bi girls often have very homophobic ideas about the validity of lesbian relationships, and their partners desires. It comes up a lot in polyamory:

'Oh youre insecure about me sleeping with other men, but with girls its fine? You need to learn to validate all relationships cuz stacy makes me cum harder than any man, just cuz she doesn't have a dick doesn't mean im not gonna drop your dick like bad news for a girl that doesn't diminish my Sexuality.'

So watch out for those straights. Even bisexuals/gays can be internalized homophobic as fuck. Hell i know leftist queers who march in the streets but put them in a conversation with a trans girl for five minutes and all those unaddressed biases tumble out. 

The only way to truly filter them out is to be the thing all homophobes hate."

Straight people are so rigid about hetero meaning not an once of gayness this doesn't work the other way though, saying you're straight means you are not bi.

Kind of like how if someone says they're black, they could very well be mixed with a white parent too. But white people are so serious about white being valid only without an once of blackness that this doesn't work the other way though, saying you are white means you are not mixed.

Relevant review i found :

This is a GREAT top coat. But it shouldn't, in my experience, be used the same way that Seche Vite is used. Seche Vite (in the clear bottle) penetrates through still-wet polish to dry it more quickly. Seche Vive (in the blue bottle) dries quickly BUT doesn't also dry the polish underneath. That means it should be used on dry or mostly dry polish. If I try to use it in the same way I use its sibling Seche Vite, my manicure will feel dry to the touch very quickly but will still stay dentable for hours."

Here's some 101 on bisexuality hon, read the ending:

The 1990 Bisexual Manifesto

We are tired of being analyzed, defined and represented by people other than ourselves, or worse yet, not considered at all. We are frustrated by the imposed isolation and invisibility that comes from being told or expected to choose either a homosexual or heterosexual identity.

Monosexuality is a heterosexist dictate used to oppress homosexuals and to negate the validity of bisexuality.

Bisexuality is a whole, fluid identity. Do not assume that bisexuality is binary or duogamous in nature: that we have ""two"" sides or that we must be involved simultaneously with both genders to be fulfilled human beings. In fact, don’t assume that there are only two genders. Do not mistake our fluidity for confusion, irresponsibility, or an inability to commit. Do not equate promiscuity, infidelity, or unsafe sexual behavior with bisexuality. Those are human traits that cross all sexual orientations. Nothing should be assumed about anyone’s sexuality, including your own.

We are angered by those who refuse to accept our existence; our issues; our contributions; our alliances; our voice. It is time for the bisexual voice to be heard. - From the wealth of knowledge that is the Bialogue Tumblr (original attribution: the historic Bay Area Bisexual Network publication Anything That Moves)

The binary implied in the word “bisexual” pertains to our ability to be attracted both to individuals who are the “same” as us and to those are “different” from us — meaning we have the capacity to be attracted to people all across the gender and sexuality spectra."

SapphoAndHerFriend,fcz0dte,t1_fcywa5j,1578091104.0,"uh yea jagger slept with boys. like a huge part of jaggers flair is his queerness. so much of that era's stars packaged the allure of queerness in a non-explicitly queer package so people could enjoy it without acknowledging the gay. See Freddie, Bowie (who jagger slept with by bowies wife and other accounts)."
SapphoAndHerFriend,fcz05jb,t1_fcyvku2,1578090956.0,"the fact that straight men whom ive met dont act flamboyantly is now my fault?? honey, dont blame me for the patriarchal fear of looking gay, i actively support and encourage flamboyance in straight men. 

PS pointing out that there is a problem is not the same as being a problem, youll notice i didnt say straight men cannot or should not be flamboyant, just that i personally have never seen a straight man do jazz hands, hip thrust, and say boom baby. have you? you jumping to criticizing me for simply describing my reality because it includes an ugly truth reminds me of people who think mentioning the existence of oppressive gender roles is the real problem, rather than the oppressive roles themselves.

PPS your name is charming"

""Hate your hair.

Not likely.

Yikes.

Yikes.

Yikes. 

Let me guess you have a great personality?""

Also I've never met a straight man who enters the room with a hip thrust, jazz hands, and ""boom, baby."""

When it feels like you're being chased by monsters, focus on mind control until you can have some control over how you see the shadows. The scary looks from strangers are now just people supporting you. Remember, when in doubt, mind control."
