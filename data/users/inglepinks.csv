I know some tiny chicks who are absolutely vile to the huge guys they are dating/married too. I know one wife who stabbed her husband with a roasting fork. He never hit her back because 'boys shouldn't hit girls"". Stuff that for a joke.

Nobody should put their hands on anybody else without permission. If they do, and they get hit back, then that's on them. My tits are not a free pass to being able to act like a douche noozle without consequences."

And it's not a no other option thing, because my mum's car has the passenger alarm and it doesn't go off. My dad's car has the passenger seat alarm and it drives me bonkers."
JusticeServed,ffxzt35,t1_ffxz7xb,1580335693.0,"He groped the bouncer in a deliberately provocative way. He didn't even get hit for that.

He then mucked about for ages. Didn't get hit for that.

The SECOND time he touched the bouncer without any cause he was shoved away.

If that was a girl doing that, she would have likely received, and deserved the same treatment.

offmychest,ffsfh14,t3_euofsg,1580180414.0,"I have tiny dogs. Seriously tiny, my Yorkie is 2.37kg currently, that's like 5 pounds ish. I would bring that dog everywhere with me if he was fond of traveling. Even though he is tiny he is still a dog. He still exhibits dog-like behaviour. If I am walking down the street with him and my other dog (a Shih Tzu) I gauge how people towards them.

Some people and children get really excited by the tiny dogs, some people tense up. If they tense up I cross the road. My dogs don't know any different, but it means a lot to the other people. Why should I force my animal on someone else? If it was a snake, a crocodile, a spider, or even a moth, people are understanding. People who have them as pets won't force people to interact when you are in their home, so why can't I do that with my dogs?

Anyway people who don't keep their animals under control suck, I'm sorry your daughter is upset."

AnimalsBeingJerks,ffiqssv,t3_etqeza,1579980398.0,That moment when you find out that your dog might be dumb because of her breed. My dog Grape is also a Shih Tzu and she is adorable but dumber than a door knob. She does that same hunting for it thing! The funniest time is when she runs outside to chase birds and they fly away. She will spend ages sniffing around the ground trying to find where they went.

instant_regret,ff114s1,t1_fezwg95,1579474214.0,"I absolutely agree! I have a vibrating collar for my Yorkie. It works great, beeps when he first barks, then beeps and vibrates. My other dog though, she couldn't care less about the beeping and vibrating.

So after a lot of research I got a collar for small dogs (not as high voltage) and then I have it set on the lowest setting. When she barks it beeps, then beeps louder, then gives her a shock. I tried out the collar, the shock feels like the static shock you get from doors and stuff. Not sore, just gives you a bit of a fright.

It works for her. She doesn't get upset by it at all. She gets the shock and looks around to find out who's throwing things at her! She only ever gets the collar on when she gets stuck in a loop barking, and our attempts to shush her aren't working. She gets days where her own tail sets her off barking like a chihuahua on crack.

Anyway my point is that you have to do your research, know your animals, and, in the case of electronic products, test them yourself."

PiratePets,fenw21k,t1_fekuhel,1579291727.0,"When he was about 6 years old he get out from under the groomers gate and went for a wander down a 100km/hr road. A car came around the corner, saw Crush, slowed down and swerved, but still side swiped him. The driver was in no way at fault, but he was very apologetic, and drove Crush and I to my vet. His hip and pelvis were shattered. His tail was broken in 2 places. He had some initial swelling on the brain, but recovered from that. 2 months after surgery to remove his leg and tail, and reconstruct his pelvis, he was racing me up the stairs again!

Now 4 years later he thinks he quite the celebrity because he gets so many pats and cuddles when we go for walks. Every kid that sees him gets told that Crush lost his leg and tail because he was playing on the road. So that is why we have to listen to adults who say we have to keep off the road. There may as well be some sort of lesson in it all."

TalesFromYourServer,fefqyik,t1_fee3jej,1579062659.0,"As someone else said, it means cut out what you are doing, and behave yourself. So if a child was loudly demanding lollies at the shops, then their mum might tell them to pull their head in: meaning shush, calm down, and shop quietly."
TalesFromYourServer,fefqkx5,t1_fed6pte,1579062377.0,"Sadly no. We sold it, after us it was various types of cafes for a while, then briefly a sex toys shop, and I'm not sure now. It was a good location, right next to the Civic theatre, but it really needed a liquor licence to be viable and the liquor licensing trust are a mongrel to deal with, so we moved on.

Yeah I think that the sometimes it's a bit of the British still in a lot of Kiwi's, they don't make a fuss, and don't demand their rights. Whereas America started by telling England to get bent, and they have been telling everyone to do that ever since."
TalesFromYourServer,fefq4bw,t1_feeycxc,1579062026.0,"Ummm I didn't call them scum. Also I am Dutch, as are my parents, that's why we opened a Dutch cafe. It was more that they have this abrupt bluntness about them. I'm sorry for offending you."
TalesFromYourServer,fecsl4b,t1_fecg2h3,1578983012.0,"I loved working in hospitality. But, and it's a huge but: I would only go back if I could run the place/owned it.

I started in hospitality working for a woman who did not believe in the customer is always right. She had no time for shitty people. Then my parents started up a Dutch cafe in a city in New Zealand. My sister and I ran it.  Now Dutch people are rude. They don't have the politeness filter that most people have. But they can take what they dish out for the most part.

I had some fantastic customers, and I had some awful ones. But I ran the place. I loved it. People who were rude were told to pull their head in. People who allowed their children to 'paint' the tables with their drink were given cleaning products or risked being charged extra. Staff were 'family' so they could also stand up for themselves without Karen's having a viable threat. People thought everyone was a daughter of my parents.

The best bits though was being able to care for the awesome customers or the . And our staff loved that as well. The little old lady who fell outside on the footpath was ushered into the cafe and given a free cup of tea and a cake. The favourite customer who couldn't afford coffee with their lunch were given an accidentally made coffee. The customers who were celebrating or distressed were snuck a 'stronger' drink. 

Being able to act as you naturally would was amazing. Being able to tell scammers to take a hike was even better. So yeah, unless I run it  I don't want to go back."

gifs,fdjdntn,t1_fdhbuv1,1578466496.0,"Maybe this might help, a little: yes being a vet involves losing your patients, and having to 'put them down' when the time comes. BUT it also involves having owners come in with their injured pets, and getting to be the fount of knowledge.

In my case, my tiny Yorkie dog who was hit by a car on a 100km an hour road. He was very hurt, and just staring at me with these huge confused eyes. I was a complete mess. My role in his life is to never let anything bad happen to him, and the worst had happened.

I was driven to the vet, by the poor person who hit my dog (not at all his fault, and he tried his best to avoid it) followed by his wife in their car. I was a wreck at the vets, and then they said that his shredded leg wasn't the worrying thing, it was his head injury.

They had to put him on pain relief, and monitor him. He was touch and go for a few days, and then the head swelling went down and they could operate. Everyday for just over a week I had to pick him up at my local vets, at the end of every work day, drive him into the after hours vet to be monitored overnight, then pick him up again in the morning to go back to my local vet.

Eventually he was at a point where I could take him home and medicate etc. every couple of hours at home and work (thank you to understanding bosses), and he was a brand new badass pirate puppy after a few months.

The whole situation was traumatic. My brave and fearless dog was, for the first time in his life, mentally tiny and helpless. Every vet, and every vet nurse, and every receptionist, and every therapist that I encountered along the months long mission that was his surgery, recovery, and physio were amazing.

They got to be the something that could be done. I was helpless. He was helpless. I couldn't fix this. But they could. They could stop his pain, gently send him over the rainbow bridge if that was needed, fix what needed fixing, and share their vast knowledge and expertise.

That is awesome. Even if he had to be put to sleep they could help. I couldn't even reassure him. They gave him relief, and continued quality of life. That ability to know what to do is amazing. Even if the knowledge results in having to end things, knowing that this is the best thing for the animal, that this is the best way to deal with things is powerful,band so appreciated!"

LifeProTips,fd756cb,t3_ek1nsp,1578199571.0,"I love that a lot of these life pro tips are about being a better human being. So often people assume others should know what they know, and they get grumpy when they don't follow those 'rules'.

But there are many 'normal human behaviours' that need to be taught. It's like kids that grow up in messed up families, they think that the way they respond is normal, because that is what they know.

I feel like generations in the past and the whole 'karen' phenomenon is due to people feeling like they must fight to survive. Everyone is an enemy. The modern generation appears to try their best to work together so everyone is happy and their world is safe.

It's an awesome thing to be fighting for, and I have all sorts of 'proud aunty' feelings for these kids that are making the world a better place for everyone!"
