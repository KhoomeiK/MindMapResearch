facepalm,ffk4rvd,t1_ffiejt9,1580015837.0,"N British reality TV shows, everytime I've  seen Ketamine administered it was by EMT techs who never asked the victims weight.
Of course here in the US we cannot even have Entonox gas unless it's in a dentist office. How much better the stress of childbirth or a victim of an accident would be if the medics could administer some simple laughing gas!
I saw one girl that was screaming her head off to the EMTs. Not because of her twisted, possibly torn ACL but because the medic wanted to start a line for Ketamine! Once she breathed in a little Entonoxgas, she relaxed and they got the line in. No more stress to the patient or the poor crew!
America is so afraid of lawyers that patients suffer."

Maybe he is interpreting that sign as meaning that due to the algae bloom the crabs impossible to catch and he's showing everyone how many he caught?
I'm willing to bet this lovely bagel with cream cheese that he is going to try and sell them without giving the buyers the information of when and where they were caught.
If he does and someone falls ill, then the cops should catch a few smaller ones and toss them into his boxers!"

Wow!"

Out of curiosity I've spent the morning reading about the states. Learned a few things like they changed PA's slogan in 2004! 
Thanks for the info."
facepalm,ff9vu0a,t1_ff95mer,1579722618.0,"UPDATE: Back when dinosaur's walked the earth and I was in school, Pa's state slogan was, ""The State of Independence"". However, I've learned today that Pennsylvania changed their slogan in 2004 to, ""Pennsylvania. Pursue your happiness."" 
Her motto was not in Latin. It reads, ""Virtue, liberty and independence""
The tourist slogan is ""You've gotta friend in Pennsylvania""
I sometimes get homesick and wish I could go back to Pittsburgh. I am a Pittsburgher first, then a Pennsylvanian as many of my friends back home would say.
I've always felt that no matter how far I go, no matter how far I may roam, Pittsburgh will always be home. 
Hey, I'm a poet and didn't know it!!"
facepalm,ff9u8du,t1_ff991lw,1579721437.0,"Catholic school and latin was a long time ago, but it's Sic Semper Tyrannis, the literal translation is ""So always tyrants"" but the VA motto says ""Thus ever unto tyrants"".
You're right that those were the words Booth screamed when he assassinated Lincoln."
facepalm,ff95mer,t1_ff8t8ki,1579705401.0,"I was born and raised in the ""commonwealth"" of Pennsylvania and their motto is the Keystone State.
Pennsylvania's essential role in the founding of the United States earned it the nickname, the “Keystone State.” The term “keystone” comes from architecture and refers to the central, wedge-shaped stone in an arch, which holds all the other stones in place.
I now live in Virginia. which happens to be another commonwealth, and its slogan is ""Virginia is for Lovers"". It's been the travel slogan since 1969.
There's a difference between a state's motto and its slogan. The motto is usually in Latin, but I don't remember either states Latin mottos now."
