AskReddit,ff9112p,t1_ff8ruon,1579702136.0,"I suppose so. I can just see people saying ""if you're bored, you're boring."" and trying to apply it to all situations where someone is bored, when that might not be the case."
AskReddit,ff8r4ke,t1_ff8mgpa,1579692691.0,"I wouldn't say this applies all the time though. Individuals who aren't boring can be placed in environments/situations which sap the potential for interesting moments out of them. Sitting in a silent hospital waiting room awaiting uncertain news can be just draining no matter how interesting the people you're with are.

That said, if you're constantly bored, then just maybe there's a common factor there."

Can't confirm how it works out price-wise yet as i've not had to buy any replacements beyond a new cola syrup bottle, but i've basically reduced my plastic bottle count from 15 two-litres bottles a month to zero.

I'd recommend it, if only because if more people bought this stuff then the price of the syrup bottles goes down for everyone, plus the huge plastic reduction."

They were clearly messing with me and just didn't care. I asked for a piece of paper on the spot and wrote it 'I quit your gym', then signed name and ID number before walking out.

This wasn't even a chain. It was the local leisure centre of a small village. The whole thing was stupid."

writing,ff4efqa,t3_erfrik,1579561656.0,"Ooh, i had one of my books end up like this. It's hard to get this kind of thing right but i'll go through my experience as best I can. On my first main draft my editor had issues with it because it left a lot of ambiguity, and it took a few rewrites to make it carry a strong feeling at the end.

1 - Sounds obvious, but make it clear to the reader that the original goal hasn't been established. Don't do this, and it'll make it look like you've forgotten your own plot.

2 - Giving up should still give some sense of conflict to make it clear that it's part of the story. One character could refuse to accept that they're giving up, and try to go on anyway, or something to that effect. As a follow-up to this, make sure that giving up isn't the last thing in your novel (unless you can *really* make it work). Giving up is the type of ending that can suck just because the ideas behind it don't get followed up. You don't want it to be in line with #and then he woke up and it was all just a dream.'

3 - Try to grab the feeling you that you actually want to bring to the ending, one that differs to a feeling of being pissed off because they *just* turned back. 

3a - If you want it to end on a positive note, it should be more that a compromise has been met, rather than an apathetic tragic shrug of giving up. Rather than just turning back, it should be more that they turn back to continue their journey together, which was worth a lot more to them than their eventual goal. There should be a feeling of hopefulness at the end. 

3b - If you want it to end on a negative note, then the choice to give up should create a schism between the characters. There should be a feeling of emptiness at the end.

4 - Probably the most important one, it should feel natural to the reader that giving up was an option. It's essentially a twist ending, even if it feels anti-climatic, so it should follow the usual rules of a 'decent twist' e.g. the clues were there all along, it doesn't feel like an ass-pull, and a second watch through should reveal things that were missed before without the context of giving up.

Hope that helps."

comic_crits,femo5yv,t1_feklied,1579264412.0,"Thanks a lot. I'm over the halfway point now so i just have to keep it up.

It's a little hard to explain how i draw heads, but the construction lines do essentially form a 3D plane (i can be terrible at matching up the eyes, so doing it this way helped a lot). However, it is occurring to me that for the two guards i may be switching to a more cartoon style that skips this on occasion, and when it comes to the smaller panels things can get a little crowded.

I do do gesture drawings but not as much as i should. I do start each figure with a stickman gesture, but then i guess it tends to get heavily modified so maybe that's making it stiffer in the process. I'll keep practising. Thanks again."

Basically, is running on fast days better for losing weight than on non-fast days?"
comic_crits,fekj7sn,t1_fekb5dy,1579201174.0,Thanks a lot. Much appreciated.
comic_crits,fekj71l,t1_fek0x2s,1579201162.0,"Thanks a bunch. I think emphasising line weight is just what I need. I feel like the characters needed a little extra pop to make them stand out so this seems to be what i'm looking for. I'll try the advice on the action's lines too. I'm trying to figure them out as i go along so there's  a few experiments going on here.

I think I may have a way of working another panel in there for the robot, but i'll have to photoshop it in. May have to save that for after the bulk of the challenge when i have some spare moments.

Lilly's hair is meant to be similar to [Goku's magical flipping hair](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/goku_hair_3073.jpg), but if it's looking too static i'll try to up the flow of it. It's not like Goku's doesn't swish all over the place, so the same should happen here.

Your hobbyist opinion is very much appreciated. You're hitting points that i was suspecting myself. I'm posting it all on [my instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sazazezer/) as i make it, but i'll make sure to update here when it's complete too."
comic_crits,fek1aje,t1_fejwhab,1579190469.0,"Thanks. The backgrounds are fun to do, so it's good to hear that they work out.

It occurred to me when i started this that i don't tend to practise drawing children, so i'm definitely screwing up proportions. I'll see about polishing it up.

I've already got a storyboard in place but i'll see if i can switch things up with page layouts. Adding more blacks is kind of scary. It feels like it can overwhelm the page if i'm not careful, but then i probably end up not using them enough as a result. I'll make a point of experimenting.

Thanks a lot."

AskReddit,fejxo3b,t1_fej0151,1579188209.0,"I always wondered, is looking up how to do a Rubik cube breaking the spirit of why people do Rubik's cubes in the first place? I would figure it's a puzzle to be figured out, rather than a list of steps to be memorised.

Sure it looks amazing to see someone solve one in a super quick time, and that speed is a skill in itself, but at its core the cube is a puzzle game. Looking up the algorithm kind of feels like you're just flipping over to the answers page in a crossword book."

writing,fejcyov,t1_feiwu01,1579167858.0,"Aye, it's more like people noticed the pattern after reading a ton of books and then put together a generalised idea of how all stories should go, because we like making patterns and establishing trends.

It can be good for beginners, as a sort of way of ensuring that you book is at least following *some* kind of basic structure if you start getting paranoid that you've just rambled on for a hundred pages. But as a hard standard for how stories should go, it's a big nope.

Art has a similar thing in the 'Golden Spiral'. You get plenty of respectable artists or critics caught in the rush of applying the golden spiral to their artwork as a some kind of measurement for 'good' art. In the process it's far too easy to forget that comparing the art to a spiral after the fact may not be what the piece of art was going for in the first place.

I'll be half awake, remember someone from long ago in my past (like when i was 10 years old, i'm 36 now), and just feel real anxious over it, like it's a long lost part of my past that can never be retrieved. Some of these people will just be kids that went to my school, that I wasn't even friends with. In some cases, it'll just be a name, but the anxiety still grips me.
