tumblr,feo5412,t1_fenupfc,1579295248.0,I'm 25 and I cringe at everything I've ever done or said. I think I'm basically immune at this point.
AskReddit,fe4w0qe,t1_fe19rgs,1578863319.0,"My little brother had a speech delay- I don't think he said his first word until he was nearly 4 years old. When he was young, he had a speech impediment so severe most people couldn't understand him. Teachers would sometimes pull me out of class to translate. Nowadays he is more understandable, but the speech impediment is still obvious.

My brother likes video games, like Pokemon, Minecraft, Megaman, and Portal. He's really good at them. You probably need good spatial reasoning to do well at a puzzle game like Portal, so that makes sense. 

Both of us were into nerdy stuff growing up. We'd watch science and medical documentaries, Mythbusters, Animal Planet, etc. We and our parents would have discussions about what we learned in the shows, and he'd sometimes need extra explanations, but he could hold his own and contribute. It's clear he can understand concepts if they are explained to him the right way.

However, he had severe difficulties in school. His sensory issues and social problems were huge obstacles. He has trouble understanding figures of speech and indirect communication. Even in subjects he was good at, he'd have issues because of things like misunderstanding instructions. You could hand him a worksheet filled with problems he could do *easily*, but if the instructions at the top weren't very clear, direct, and literal, he might become so confused and frustrated that he'd have a meltdown (this actually happened). He had accommodations but still struggled. 

The social difficulties plus the speech impediment, would likely not give the first impression of an intelligent person. Get him talking about a subject he's interested in, though? Boy sounds like an encyclopedia. I think that surprised a lot of adults growing up, realizing this special ed kid they had written off as stupid had a deeper understanding than them on some topics.

Sorry this is so long, but I hope it's a good explanation!"
AskReddit,fdyn187,t1_fdygvko,1578781539.0,"Not OP and not a psychologist, but it's common for people for people with mental disabilities to get uneven results in different areas. My brother, for example, scored high on the nonverbal portion and low in the verbal portion of his IQ test. (Doctor noted I had uneven results as well, but not nearly to the same extent.) My brother and I are autistic, but similar things happen for people with other disabilities. Considering how common conditions like dyslexia are, there is likely a sizable minority of people with uneven intelligence in different areas."
Rammstein,fdbscxz,t1_fdbrozw,1578261199.0,"""Said [x] rights"" is also a meme. Honestly seems like a pretty normal tumblr post to me lol"
Rammstein,fdbr9s1,t1_fd8ikqs,1578260714.0,"It's a tumblr meme. Drinking your ""respect [x] juice"" means you respect [x]. It doesn't make much sense because that's just the way memes are."
todayilearned,fd4id3q,t1_fd3cowf,1578167770.0,"I have lived in small towns and a trailer park. They also had drugs and crime. Over half the population of my hometown lived under the poverty line. Some people lived in decent houses, others lived in decaying, roach-infested shitholes. There was also a meth problem. It's got its own issues, but moving to the city was a huge improvement for me personally."
wholesomememes,fcytnq9,t1_fcya5ib,1578086838.0,No. Sounds like it's poorly made.
wholesomememes,fcytllt,t1_fcy9pwo,1578086803.0,It's okay. I as an autistic person grant you permission to use the sacred autism blankets. lol
wholesomememes,fcysve4,t1_fcy6bz0,1578086353.0,"Yeah, they first got popular with autistic people to help with anxiety and sensory issues. But it's okay, we give y'all permission to use them too."

I wonder if you could make black metal by adding distortion to surf music."
