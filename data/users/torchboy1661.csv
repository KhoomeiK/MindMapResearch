insaneparents,fewpnvy,t1_fewntn1,1579417619.0,"That's the way this sub and much of Reddit goes. This is actually mild compared to how I thought people would react.

Thanks for the upvote!"
insaneparents,feuov9e,t1_feungfx,1579388613.0,"I know my comment may come across as painting a broad stroke but I feel a lot of the, ""You're my parent. You're supposed to do those things..."" get into the realm of ungratefulness and a mentality that it should be expected to get all they have."
CHICubs,feuof1v,t1_fetqd44,1579388453.0,"This is something in which MLB is way behind the curve. They wonder why there isn't a ""national audience"" or marquee superstars like their are in other sports leagues. Then they make it difficult to watch the teams or games you want. They are stuck in an old mentality that cable is king. T.V. deals are still lucrative enough to justify not investing in new technology and new ideas. 

The Cubs situation isn't helped partly because the organization was in such a hurry to capitalize of 2016. They also assumed they would be in the WS every other year like the Giants were. They didn't really think all the nuts and bolts and how to get MLB to play along and change their policies and mentality."
insaneparents,feumuue,t1_fetkr2g,1579388013.0,That's weird how some parents think all the providing they do should be met with some level of respect and appreciation.
CHICubs,feum4rq,t3_eqisje,1579387857.0,I think a camera in center field and a trashcan would have been cheaper.
Showerthoughts,feulp91,t1_ferbr2p,1579387701.0,I was told older financial books used a light yellow paper and green ink because it was easier on the eyes back in the day when not everything was glowing under fluorescent or LED lights.
todayilearned,felx3bb,t1_felu6sx,1579233120.0,Who were they? Why did they come? What did they leave behind? Where did they go? Will they return?
todayilearned,fel4cks,t1_feku308,1579213785.0,"My neighborhood has a skunk problem. There were some nights I would walk my dog around the backyard as opposed to letting her run so she wouldn't go chasing after skunks. Also, if there had been reports of coyotes in the area, I would walk around the yard with my dog at night. We only have a quarter acre and it is big enough to walk a dog just to let it take a leak or something like that. 

Also, while I am not finding buckets in my backyard, I am finding antique keys and bottles. Our house dates from the 1930s so who knows what has stood on or lied in that ground in that time."

Indiana,fds8t79,t1_fds4lsm,1578696967.0,That was my thought exactly. OP must be pro cannabis and anti-Pete. Neither the Mayor or the state of Indiana was mentioned or even hinted at in the article. Just that awkward photo.

AskReddit,fcpsv8x,t3_eic8yl,1577871404.0,"I would not take it. 

In December 2011, I had been married for only 3 months and was in super duper honeymoon love with my wife. Fast forward to January 1, 2020 and I am 8,years, 4 months married and the father to the most wonderful, cool, chill, precious little boy. 

I would not trade all of the dumb shit, ignorance, or mistakes in my past to risk not being where I am right now. 

The universe had a plan for me and I'm down with it."

todayilearned,fc5m6zu,t3_eg77ql,1577461274.0,"My wife's grandfather was Clark Gable's commanding officer. 

He would tell us when there was a bar fight, the local newspapers would list the names of the offenders unless it was Gable who was involved. Then the story would read something like. Person A, Person B, and ""an unnamed individual and his commanding officer."" Then, if there was a PR opportunity, the papers would read, ""Clark Gable with unnamed officers.""

Unfortunately, when I met my wife's grandfather, he could barely talk and didn't like telling stories from the war so that's all I really have for juicey Ckark Gable stories. However, we do have photographs of the two together."
oasis,fbiq124,t1_fbid57u,1576909352.0,"What if they came together to do one show? They play old stuff, a couple new and post Oasis things and you can stream it live or watch it in movie theaters around the world? 

Like a 5 hour mega-event? Or a 3 day festival where they get some good bands to open each night and one night Noel plays some stuff, the other night, Liam. Then the third night they play together for a classic balls to wall reunion show. 

I think it would be worth it. Viewing technology is so much better and almost anyone could access it or see it live in-person."
