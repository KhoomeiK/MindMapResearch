Just the same I’d like to hear what YOU think the best option is for a system of government/economic system?"
HolUp,ff75i09,t1_ff73rfl,1579641522.0,"Power is shared between 3 branches of our democracy which makes it harder to consolidate power, so in that way it is most certainly superior to communist rule.  Capitalism can totally be gamed, but again not as badly as communist economies.  

One has no power at all in a communist society, which is just feudalism rebranded.  Your insinuation that capitalist democracies are equally as bad as communist governments is ridiculous.  Quality of life is consistently far, far worse in a communist country.  In a communist country there is always far less freedom and a much more unfair division of wealth.

I and millions more Americans can afford to donate to political candidates of our choosing.  Capitalism is not perfect but communism is a disaster."

What other countries can you list where communism provided a desirable life for the common people?"
HolUp,ff6965p,t1_ff54pzz,1579622063.0,"I know more people from communist countries than you do, I can assure you, but thank you for the offer of help.  “Communism” in Yugoslavia only worked because of Tito, NOT because of the system just like Fascism worked in Spain only because of Franco.  They were benevolent dictators who actually cared about their countries.  (Tito’s letter to Stalin was one of the finest demonstrations of balls I’ve ever heard of, btw).

People in Cuba were only allowed to start leaving the island in the past few years.  For decades the only ways to *escape* (yes, *escape*) was defecting, jumping on a raft to float the Gulf with only a 50% chance of making it ***OR*** la Lotería.  La Lotería was a quite literally a government Lottery where THE LOSER was forced to stay on the island despite wanting to leave and THE WINNER was allowed to leave.  In Cuba you could request a career but there was no guarantee you would receive that job which meant the government would force you to take the job they saw fit to give you (like in USSR, Vietnam, Cambodia, etc).  If you were caught trying to escape on a raft you were put in prison.  Sounds like paradise, huh?

In Cuba you are TOLD where you will live even if you want to move to another city.  In Cuba if you criticize the government they cut off your “rations” (virtually non existent food and clothing that’s not nearly enough) while the party elite, one of whom I know personally, live like the oligarchs they are.  People in Cuba hate the government and it’s bossy way of running their lives.

Remember all the people being shot as they tried to escape from the East Berlin to West Berlin?  Yeah, also a paradise.  Castro and his family and their children and grandchildren live lives of piglike opulence while the people starve.  Tonito was busted in Mykonos with his entourage and bodyguards having arrived on his $30 million yacht.

Communism is far more susceptible to corruption than US democracy because power is not shared and therefore easier to consolidate (though our current situation proves it’s not impossible).

But back to Yugoslavia, without Tito the whole thing devolved into a nightmarish war and broke the country apart.

Fuck extremism, left or right.  Give me autonomy everyday."

HolUp,fezk2cw,t1_fezi5tm,1579458170.0,"So extraction of resources is your only strategy for the creation of value?  You really ARE a communist!  

“Venezuela is awash with natural resources such as diamonds, bauxite, gold, iron ore, natural gas and petroleum. The GDP of the country was -$389.4 billion as of 2017. The country largely depends on oil revenues, which accounts for about 98% of the export value and around 8% of the country's GDP value.”

Communism is parasitic by its nature and is famous for producing some of the worst engineering failures in the modern era.  

Also, being told what you will do for a living, where you will live and whether or not you can move or what you can own  is exactly as shitty as it sounds."

HolUp,fez2xxb,t1_feywkf5,1579453385.0,"PDVSA, the largest player in their economy is private?

The whole planet including Venezuela disagrees:

“ Oil reserves in Venezuela are the largest in the world and the state-owned PDVSA provides the government of Venezuela with substantial funding resources.[5] Following the Bolivarian Revolution, PDVSA was mainly used as a political tool of the government.[6] Profits were also used to assist the presidency, with funds directed towards allies of the Venezuelan government.[6]

With PDVSA focusing on political projects instead of oil production, mechanical and technical statuses deteriorated while employee expertise was removed following thousands of politically-motivated firings.[6] Incompetence within the company has led to serious inefficiencies and accidents as well as endemic corruption.[7] As a result, thousands of workers have abandoned their work for PDVSA,[8] especially after PDVSA was put under military control.[9]”
