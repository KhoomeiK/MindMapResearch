news,ff9j6ov,t1_ff90uup,1579714144.0,"I live in a small, redneck town and we had something similar happen. FBI investigated. He's no longer a cop.

Edit: actually twice in recent years. One of them was a fish and wildlife officer though. He's currently in jail."
MadeMeSmile,ff7nt2s,t1_ff763ut,1579653998.0,"Then there's people like my mom... She complains ""kids these days just Google everything."" Yet, she'll text me with a problem, I'll google it, and call her and tell her how to fix it. One day she finally said ""wow! You really know a lot of random stuff!"" I said ""yeah, I know how to use Google."" She wasn't impressed, but still thankful. 

I'm just glad she finally got an LG brand smartphone. I've always had LG phones so I can basically walk her through anything from memory."
todayilearned,ff5va64,t1_ff5rxv4,1579611459.0,"This exactly. I've been to quite a few demolition derbys and not once have I seen an actual explosion. Lots and lots of fires and a couple roll overs, yes. No explosions. The worst injury I've also witnessed was 2 cars hitting eachother head-on from across the arena, then dead silence, followed by one dude screaming. The impact had shoved the firewall into the cab, snapping his leg."
nothingeverhappens,ff4v5b5,t1_ff4qxw6,1579573189.0,"On a very basic level, sure, why not? Especially if they have a younger sibling, or cousin, or mom's friend is pregnant. A 2 year old can understand ""mommies grow babies in their belly."""
yesyesyesno,ff4s8j9,t1_ff4r72o,1579571196.0,"Personally, I've always had to force myself to eat SO I can get some sleep. Otherwise I'm up for fucking everrrrrr. It'll be 8 hours since the last bump and I've been up for 30 hours, I ain't sleeping till I force even a little bit of food down."
TwoXChromosomes,ff4r68g,t1_ff4fmhm,1579570467.0,"Yuppppp. My sister's friend's little boy fell on the playground. Cut his throat bad enough he had to be airlifted to a trauma hospital 150 miles away. One helicopter flight, emergency surgery, and ICU stay later.... Daycare's insurance covered it all. I believe it was about a $200,000 bill. $35k just for the flight."
slavelabour,ff0qcu1,t3_eqxnwy,1579471334.0,Sending a PM
TrollXChromosomes,fezager,t1_feyv6hh,1579455343.0,"I had my bra snapped a couple times. Due to growing up in a logging town, most of the boys wore suspenders. Didn't take those jerks very long to realize us girls would snap their suspenders right back, which I was told, really fucking hurt. Much thicker, stronger elastic and across their entire backs."
CleaningTips,fez3ig6,t3_eqx32d,1579453551.0,I'd try rubbing alcohol. We would use alcohol wipes at my last job to get flavored syrup stains off of the counters.
todayilearned,fep0b1k,t1_feoxu2i,1579309280.0,I would definitely check it out. Especially if you got to interact/talk to them. These type of people absolutely *fascinate* me.
Antiques,femuqc3,t1_femt60q,1579270124.0,My grandma has like 500 of these souveniour spoons. They're pretty awesome.

sterileprocessing,feidcwf,t3_ek5hlb,1579135869.0,"I know you posted this 10 days ago... But have you checked into small hospitals? I don't have my certification yet but am getting my certification and on the job training at work. We're a small, rural, critical access hospital."
Damnthatsinteresting,fef3lqj,t1_fee7q0r,1579047377.0,"Shit. To get flown out from my local, rural hospital is *easily* $30,000. In some cases, if other helicopters can't come in, we'll call the fucking *military* to come get you.... I have no idea how much that bill is yet, I don't know anyone personally that has had to use it."
Awwducational,fe43fxn,t1_fe38vo8,1578855424.0,"Same. And I'm 28, and have lived on the coast my entire life."
TrollXChromosomes,fe3e1cp,t1_fe0bstg,1578848424.0,Hey! Mines always my left! We balance each other out haha
EarthPorn,fdzut9x,t1_fdwwvqg,1578796309.0,Are you kidding me? I seriously lived like 15 miles away from this place for 2 years and I never knew it was there! :( now I'm sad.... What a gorgeous place!
MadeMeSmile,fdx3lr4,t1_fdw9hwv,1578764960.0,"I was staying with my ex's dad for awhile and I did something my ex didn't like. (We weren't together at the time) and he told me, ""if you're gonna do that shit, you don't need to be living with my dad."" I said ""K, take me home"" and started packing up my stuff. He backed down pretty fucking quickly when he realized I wasn't bluffing and had other places I could stay, and therefore he had zero control over what I did. 

Glad he's an ex though. That controlling shit was ridiculous."

thewalkingdead,fdqauca,t1_fdoxvnw,1578661495.0,....I just realized he plays Malcom Bright. I knew he looked familar but never thought about it. Long hair and facial hair really can change a person's looks apparently.
AskReddit,fdn6wkp,t1_fdn6mhk,1578578941.0,"Yeah this rule went out the window when I was 8 or 9, simply for the fact I would actually eat. Also, my younger brother is/always been a huge eater. Whereas I am and always have been a small eater... I've always been told I ""eat like a bird"". Which makes the rule make even more sense."
AskReddit,fdn5yxg,t1_fdn5stk,1578578215.0,I just kinda lost interest and then I went down the wrong path in life. I kinda just fell into the job I have now and I absolutely love it.
AskReddit,fdn0zvi,t1_fdmw1js,1578573936.0,"This was a rule at my house for this reason... Because of me. If I were to drink a glass of milk or water, I'd be full enough to not want to eat dinner. After dinner is all over and put away, guess what? I was hungry. So we had to wait till we ate at least most of our food first."
AskReddit,fdm4lwy,t3_em31vg,1578539666.0,"A teacher. 

Now, I'm a central supply aide in a hospital. I basically clean, pack, and sterilize instrumentsz receive incoming packages, and keep various departments and clinics stocked with supplies. It's pretty sweet actually. Lots of potential."

memes,fdatkew,t1_fdaq1ym,1578249962.0,The truck or the turbo?
memes,fdapjuw,t1_fdankli,1578248726.0,"Haha he once told me he loved his truck (the one the turbo was for) more than me, I honestly don't blame him. It's a pretty fucking sweet truck."
memes,fdam0kl,t1_fd9kmm4,1578247528.0,"No, car guys are the best to date. I easily get my alone time cuz he spends so much time at the shop working on his trucks. Getting help working on my car is also a bonus. I also get caught about car systems and can half assed work on my own car now. 

The only downside is my living room is full of hot wheels, model cars he's built, and engine parts. Also, I'm pretty sure at the beginning of the relationship, he loved his turbo more than me. 

His grandpa told me the only things he's ever really loved is a 4 barrel carb, and me."
TalesFromYourServer,fda5nnd,t1_fd8jqf3,1578242029.0,"I just realized it does happen decently frequently in western WA. I don't think anything of it anymore. When I was living in eastern WA though, I don't think it happened once."

aww,fcrr445,t1_fcrr03g,1577905485.0,I can tell.

aww,fcrmt2e,t1_fcrfake,1577903862.0,3 year olds understand commands though. They're just psychotic assholes that do what they want... Which is usually exactly what you *don't* want them to do. Dogs are all good boys and love their human and likes to make them happy.
AskReddit,fcpepbc,t3_eiez88,1577860761.0,"Make him sit and watch a movie from my perspective of the 2 years of hell he put me through. All the mental, emotional, physical and sexual abuse. And make him actually feel what I felt. After I left and realized I was gone for good he apologized by saying something along the lines of ""I know I'll never really understand what I did to you. I know I don't even remember some of it. I will make amends to you by being the best father I can be to my boys."" Sidenote: I essentially was the only parent his kids had for 2 years, their bio-mok has mental health issues and couldn't be left alone with them for more than an hour or two at a time.

So, I would make him know *exactly* what he did. 

I think the story here tells itself, at least a simplied version."
AskReddit,fcpec09,t1_fcpcskk,1577860329.0,Bet that the Seahawks beat the Broncos by more than 14 points. I have no idea what the odds would have been on that but I bet they were crazy.
