depression,fel2vz4,t3_epmgz5,1579212883.0,"It didn't snow once in the Midlands this winter... I'm not sure if this is cuz of global warming but considering it has shifted how cold and warm it is every year I'm almost certain it is because of it.
Last year it snowed in APRIL. that cant be right.

But I feel you. It honestly is a struggle to be on a planet and knowing most of the general population couldn't give a shit. Mostly due to shit parenting or and even shittier education system. I'm looking at you, Americans."

depression,fcpzxwp,t3_eieavt,1577875769.0,Why would you post this bullshit bro. Its a new year. You never know what happens unless you work at it.
facepalm,fcpzres,t1_fcpziqy,1577875658.0,Ah ok. Well welcome lol. It's by far the best socialising app I've been on. There are some toxic people but ignoring them is actually funny. And the up voting system gets abused so often. But it is Defo ðŸ’¯ better than tik tok
facepalm,fcpze0p,t1_fcpimea,1577875432.0,"True but depending where you come from... Or at least from my experience, you get taught about forum websites like reddit. So you're bound to hear about it alongside 4chan etc."
facepalm,fcpzamm,t3_eiee6y,1577875370.0,How can you not know reddit?? How uneducated can some people be.
depression,fcmppnr,t3_ehotyn,1577786090.0,"Yeah I feel you. My two close friends basically embarrassed me in front of a whole pub saying I complain to much and I just need to chill out.


Depression is not something we can just ""chill out"". It's also not a disease. Well as far as I am aware. And I'd rather think its not. People shouldn't bring it up.

As for our friends. Help indirectly. And stop judging someone for who's only crime was to speak their mind. Should show gratitude as we have chosen you to share our secrets with."

rant,fbtykll,t3_ee6gjl,1577102551.0,You know what annoys me. The fact that people get married and have no future plan. What annoys me more is that when others make a plan for you.

diabetes,fbpdfnu,t1_fbpcl2n,1577019959.0,OK Jesus
Physics,fbi3imc,t1_fbi3dxx,1576889738.0,So antimatter became energy? Does energy become back into matter? I think I heard this somewhere that it's possible.
Physics,fbi3btm,t1_fbi363l,1576889586.0,I guess that makes sense. I didn't think about it that way. So what theories are there for antimatter. And why did we even have any in the first place.

sad,fbge8j1,t3_ed4bwa,1576846617.0,One thing that really bothered me about girls who told me this was how they  bent my mind thinking I'm an an asshole. It's not fair to tell a guy this when he is in love with you. I'm sure I speak for the majority of us when I say when we love someone... And take care more of the other person than ourselves is not because we don't like ourselves. We like you more.
depression,fb7un2a,t1_fb7uk8q,1576599764.0,This is why we nerds gotta stick together lmao
