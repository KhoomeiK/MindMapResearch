ShitPostCrusaders,ff27sa1,t1_fezxcwr,1579496276.0,Cuddles and JoJo is always the best! I gotta be careful on this subreddit though because I'm still on part 4.
creepyPMs,fdxvjm7,t1_fdwnqdr,1578773376.0,"Apologies if your notifications spammed you a response, Reddit broke and sent it three times."
creepyPMs,fdxvcgz,t1_fduhwuy,1578773307.0,Thank you for answering! I don't use Grindr so I'm no expert in the subject and appreciate the response!
creepyPMs,fdxuubj,t1_fdwnqdr,1578773120.0,Thank you for informing me! I probably very obviously do not use Grindr so I don't really know about all of the details!
creepyPMs,fdxu8gf,t1_fdxat4a,1578772998.0,"That's absolutely dreadful! I guess sometimes one can really forget how shitty people really are ):
Thank you for answering my question and explaining why so very well, I appreciate it bunches!"
creepyPMs,fducwii,t1_fduc3to,1578731305.0,"I understand being bisexual (which is why I specified males in general who have attraction to other males. That wording may have been bad but it was made to keep things open for other sexualities that could involve two men being together) Your second statement does make sense to me. One would think that someone would leave Grindr after said self discovery, but who am I to predict other's lives. It seems like a perfectly viable option to me. Thank you for your answer, I do feel that it helps a bit. Also don't worry, I've never used Grindr either."
creepyPMs,fdst16w,t3_emt7fe,1578707565.0,"My question will probably come off *extremely* ignorant, but it's something I never understood. If you're a MtF woman as the strange fellow makes it seem, then why are you on Grindr, a place that I believe is for homosexual men(or at least men with a preference towards men.) I can understand FtM on Grindr since they identify as males, gut with MtF it feels like a contradiction to one's identity. I apologize once again if I come off as rude or ignorant, but I would really like it know!"
cats,fcsw38d,t1_fcsvpxe,1577926585.0,Indeed! They both want the catnip but are too effected by it to do anything
cats,fcsu1pm,t3_eiqaii,1577925102.0,Apologies if you see this image posted multiple times! The app broke a little for me and said it wasn't posting so I accidentally posted multiple times!
creepyPMs,fchabd8,t1_fcha3m0,1577648713.0,"Definitely! I can't really say that I know anyone who says,
""Don't worry everyone, I'm going to whip out my singular tit to repent for my crimes!"""
creepyPMs,fcg8jbc,t1_fcg84qn,1577637615.0,"It's all good, I was drunk as hell when he messaged and was mostly fucking around with him, so I guess he reaped what he sowed."
creepyPMs,fcg7mvw,t1_fcf3lur,1577637247.0,"Use it to your heart's content, aye"
creepyPMs,fcg7jge,t1_fcf67i0,1577637213.0,"Because he wanted an excuse to demand titty. Earlier in the conversation he said ""if I give you a good enough reason would you show me your tits?"""
creepyPMs,fcckwol,t1_fcchz6k,1577599581.0,"I love your interpretation but no, sadly he wanted my chest sacks."
creepyPMs,fcbysor,t1_fcbygld,1577592478.0,"Oh I didn't think you meant articles! I thought you meant in general, oops."
creepyPMs,fcby65c,t1_fcbxtv7,1577592281.0,Mostly irregular verbs and proper uses of prepositions.
creepyPMs,fcbxff4,t1_fcbx81u,1577592044.0,When in doubt we go with das. In my class we use das for all the foreign words.
creepyPMs,fcbwm9p,t1_fcbvlsf,1577591782.0,Sometimes you think you got it but then you really don't.
creepyPMs,fcbv567,t1_fcbue5a,1577591323.0,"Alrighty, I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't dummy @-@. And yeah, the grammar can seem to have no logic or like there's random irregular things made to make you suffer."
creepyPMs,fcbt99k,t1_fcbs2ll,1577590717.0,"Huh, I thought it was das Auto. Articles are hard in general though because you've got to just remember them. Also, I get that 100%, I'm the same way when my boyfriend speaks German."
creepyPMs,fcbqosz,t1_fcbq4qo,1577589911.0,"I really like German, I feel like it gets a bad rep for being gutteral and harsh, but honestly I personally like the sound of the more ""aggressive"" languages. Not just that, but my favourite part of learning German is seeing what silly mistakes I make. I haven't really tried dirty talk, but I have made very direct advances."
creepyPMs,fcbpbxn,t1_fcboohp,1577589482.0,My boyfriend is German and also on Reddit! He helps me out with learning. Es geht mir gut! ^^
creepyPMs,fcboff6,t1_fcbo56e,1577589193.0,"Not really, but German tradition runs in my family and I am in the process of learning how to speak it. I am curious as to why you ask!"
