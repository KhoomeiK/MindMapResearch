PublicFreakout,fcp0nm8,t1_fcorhoo,1577846872.0,"I work grave in downtown Seattle with all the bum bitches. Deal with losers like this far more than I care to admit, plus I’m a woman. I‘ve been ten toes down my whole life because I’ve had to be that way, and the consequences of what I could possibly deal with as a result of helping someone in that situation would never outweigh the guilt I would feel had he actually gotten away with her and, God forbid, something horrible happened to her. Quit acting like looking out for someone other than yourself is heroic — it’s human! I’ve done it countless times — even had a woman try to tip me for it a couple of weeks ago. You can pull my card, I’m about that life. Find the subreddit for that."

I would’ve been shocked as well, but doing absolutely nothing about it? Unacceptable — sorry, not sorry. Bystander apathy is one of the biggest things wrong with our society. Stand tf up...so carry on as you were but please don’t tell me wtf to do when it sounds like you wouldn’t even do the right thing."
PublicFreakout,fcmwldn,t3_ehrri5,1577795551.0,"Sooo...the asshole filming this obviously feels moved enough by the weird situation to film it, but does absolutely nothing when homeboy deadass picks up this little girl and just sprints off like nothing happened."

relationship_advice,fc6j4iu,t3_eg3q65,1577481806.0,It was incredibly thoughtful of you to go out of your way to get them gifts in the first place. Insanely rude is an understatement. They wouldn’t be getting anything else from me after that.
