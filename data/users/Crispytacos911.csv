dogs,ff52uro,t1_ff4w1ks,1579578719.0,Yup.  You need to put her back into the crate.  Demote her off the bed.
KimetsuNoYaiba,ff4ilx5,t1_ff0lk40,1579564497.0,The fight could end in 10 chapters but there will be an aftermath arc that should be about another 10 chapters hopefully.  I‚Äôm guessing around 210ish
leagueoflegends,fepcjhl,t1_feooov2,1579317180.0,"Lol nah, I don‚Äôt care."
leagueoflegends,feoon3c,t1_feom01o,1579303154.0,"Sorry, it‚Äôs from castle clash.  My bad"
KimetsuNoYaiba,feja1ov,t1_fej6frl,1579163539.0,"Those 3 are ok.  The pillars have the death flag right now.  When they start falling, Tanjiro will come. Then maybe they might be in danger"
NanatsunoTaizai,feis2m3,t1_feinwnh,1579145769.0,Nabaka isn‚Äôt perfect.  Look how terrible the final DK fight was
KimetsuNoYaiba,fei69q6,t1_fei61xy,1579131216.0,"No I do realize how much this will help.  Although I‚Äôm sure Muzan will still have his 2 arms left.  

Also, Muzan probably has some blood demon arts he hasn‚Äôt used yet.  He ran away from Sunbro but since he‚Äôs cornered here, he‚Äôs gonna have to continue fighting and we‚Äôll see Muzan throughly go all out.  They still have like 1 hour 20 minutes.  That‚Äôs a lot of time."
KimetsuNoYaiba,fei5vii,t1_fei4yb2,1579130963.0,"The author doesn‚Äôt treat the pillars like fodders.  Obani will have his moment before he dies.  If she wanted to kill him off, she wouldn‚Äôt of kept him alive this long.  Obani getting the red blade is the only way they can slow Muzan down till Tanjiro comes"
KimetsuNoYaiba,fei1kka,t1_fei104c,1579128275.0,"Goku didn‚Äôt always beat the final boss.  
Tanjiro will take down Muzan but that doesn‚Äôt mean Obani didn‚Äôt beat him either."
KimetsuNoYaiba,fehtgmy,t1_fehtcdn,1579123535.0,He‚Äôs probably gonna die next chapter or after that.  But boy is he gonna shine before that.  Hopefully he gets all the pussy in the afterlife
KimetsuNoYaiba,feht8ya,t1_fehsor5,1579123414.0,No it‚Äôs obvious he‚Äôs about to do something big.  The author has let every pillar shine.  Obani was the only one who hasn‚Äôt gotten his moment yet.  However the ending of the last chapter shows that his about to turn his blade red and we know what that does to Muzan.  Obani May die but his death won‚Äôt come for free.
sportsbook,fehggkf,t1_feg0rx2,1579116032.0,Bet 365. It‚Äôs a 6 fight parlay.   Cerrone is 3.5 underdog and pettis is 3.0. That alone gives me a big jump
sportsbook,fehgd3y,t1_feg2zwo,1579115977.0,"He looked good last year when he slept wonder boy.  If it wasn‚Äôt for Jorge, that would‚Äôve been ko of the year.  Ya he got worked by diaz but that‚Äôs diaz"
sportsbook,feg46in,t1_feg45bg,1579076123.0,Yes but I‚Äôm willing to make changes on a few picks that are very close in odds.
sportsbook,feg3pw9,t1_feg0jlb,1579075554.0,By hearing their reason.  I haven‚Äôt been thoroughly following every fighter so I wanna know if they‚Äôve looked off lately.  Ya I could just watch their fights and probably will but I still wanna hear other people‚Äôs insight
sportsbook,fefzecx,t1_fefxqzh,1579070486.0,Really?  I know he‚Äôs hit or miss but he‚Äôs only lost to top guys. He‚Äôs still in his prime.  Don‚Äôt forget he used to be the #1 LW when it was the most stacked division
sportsbook,fefzc5z,t1_fefyy9g,1579070420.0,Which ones you disagree with?  I may change Conor and cerrone.  What‚Äôs wrong with the rest
dogs,fefdj75,t1_fee1cwa,1579054001.0,"I wanna get a puppy but I know it‚Äôs hard work.  At the 3 month stage, what is the biggest issue? 

Me and my mom both work part time and usually only 6-7 hour shifts."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fe63dev,t1_fe639vl,1578880872.0,Without the friendship power up.  Deku used 100% and it did nothing.  Then he screams louder and it works lol.
NanatsunoTaizai,fe4ihq6,t1_fe0exnv,1578859656.0,Cause that‚Äôs for escanor
dogs,fe4fqid,t1_fe4f442,1578858767.0,The owner was laughing in the background. Unless he had a kid who was sad
anime,fe4axm9,t3_ddzdtr,1578857406.0,"This list is dumb as fuck.  Don‚Äôt even take recommendation from this guy people.

The fact that you missed Demon slayer, Vinland saga, AOT, and Dr Stone is pathetic"
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fdxku9k,t1_fdxkkan,1578769909.0,"Lol.  It‚Äôs good to know Tomura will go all out soon.  After 4 seasons, I‚Äôm kinda bored by him.  For a guy that can kill anyone by touching you, he hasn‚Äôt done much in 76 episodes.  If his arc can match this one, that‚Äôll be great cause this arc has been my favourite in the franchise"
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fdxjpl0,t1_fdxjgdd,1578769425.0,"We‚Äôll see but so far this guy set the bar.  Tomura hasn‚Äôt fought much at all in 4 season.  The hand on his face is weird too.  

Overhaul is evil as hell.  His obsession and determination.  His quirk is insanely broken.  His transformation."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fdxh763,t1_fdup84p,1578768681.0,I still kinda want nighteye to die for the sake of adding more realism to the show
Dragonballsuper,fdsci12,t1_fdrsl21,1578699473.0,"When champs and Beerus were fighting lol.  

Goku and Beerus also destroyed some planets too when fighting"
bjj,fdscbas,t3_emtor1,1578699344.0,Why not tie the belt right below the belly at the hip?  The instructor on the right has a giant gut too but he tied his fine
dogs,fdqn8d8,t1_fdpzc2p,1578670657.0,"I‚Äôve babysitter dogs for friends here and there when they got on vacations wether it be a few days/weeks/ or even a month.  I know it‚Äôs not the same but the thing is, I get attached to them quickly, even if they have some issues.  

That‚Äôs why I want my very own dog to keep forever. I haven‚Äôt really worked with pups though."
dogs,fdqbvyq,t1_fdq9lb4,1578662431.0,"What do you mean I‚Äôm not ready for that level of responsibility?  If worst comes to worst and the dog attacks, I‚Äôll take the blame.  I won‚Äôt just throw my dog under the bus claiming to be the perfect owner like most bully/pit owners.  However I want to take all the steps to make sure such a thing never happens."
dogs,fdpvx2c,t1_fdpvt8v,1578642704.0,"Ya, it‚Äôs just the off chance another dog gets aggressive and provokes it.  Or if my Mom is walking It and she‚Äôs a small, weaker lady.  Just in case.  Also, I hear bullies have health issues.  Are pocket bullies healthier cause of their size? Also can you confirm that bullies have better temperaments than APBT?"
dogs,fdpv8b0,t1_fdpuod0,1578641871.0,"Thanks.  Ya their dogs seemed to be healthy but I told them they should check the health on their dogs before breeding and they did.  I told them that a lot of buyers will ask for their dogs vet history so they got that checked and it seems fine.  

I‚Äôm gonna wait a couple months before adopting so hopefully they get the dog tested.  I believe they will.  If not, I‚Äôll scold them.  Im getting the dog for free so I might have to do some health check ups at my own expense but buyers will demand health check ups if they have to pay so I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll do that."
BanPitBulls,fdpaw0u,t1_fdpad6h,1578624071.0,"https://youtu.be/zkKGjM407aM

Ya but you gotta do it in their puppy stage"
BanPitBulls,fdp7ofe,t1_fdp7aiz,1578621923.0,"Ya cause there‚Äôs a lot of stray Pitbulls who probably have been abused.  

Pitbulls are one of the most commonly owned dogs.  There‚Äôs so many pure and mix Pitbull breeds.  Of course the ratio will be higher.  Pitbulls are naturally aggressive to animals outside their pack so they need to be trained out of that as a PUPPY.  

All these stories about ‚Äúoh I raised my dog so well as a puppy and she‚Äôs always been good‚Äù is bullshit cause I know people who‚Äôve claimed such things but their close family members have said that was a lie and those dogs were abused by the owner.  

Pitbull owners don‚Äôt want to take responsibility so they lie and say how they never abused their dogs and how they‚Äôve always been well trained.
This isn‚Äôt always the case, but usually it is."
BanPitBulls,fdkqiep,t1_fdkq0y6,1578509048.0,"I agree with their accessibility.  They shouldn‚Äôt be for first time dog owners.  One of my friends had a Pitbull pup for his first dog.  Luckily he raised her right and she‚Äôs more of a pussy these days.  I‚Äôve seen her back off from an aggressive Pomeranian üòÖ

They shouldn‚Äôt be banned for existing.  They are great dogs but unfortunately have been a victim of shitty raising.  Listen, I can see where some of the hate comes from but I feel it‚Äôs too much.  They are great dogs but need to be socialized properly as a puppy."
BanPitBulls,fdkq0ti,t1_fdkpscz,1578508758.0,No but they were used for dog fighting too
BanPitBulls,fdg9aqb,t1_fdfi6we,1578385562.0,"That owner is a grown ass man who was told that the dog is dangerous, untrainable and shouldn‚Äôt be around kids.  Don‚Äôt blame the shelter for that.  They trusted this guy would keep the dog away from kids.

Also, German Shepard‚Äôs are pretty territorial too. Maybe we should ban them"
bjj,fdg4zvv,t1_fdg4wqe,1578380245.0,Using a baseball choke from side control to roll them over to side control.  You call that defensive ?
BanPitBulls,fde44pu,t1_ey77itf,1578330758.0,"German Shepard‚Äôs are pretty dangerous too if they attack.  Maybe we should ban German Shepard‚Äôs.  I mean they were fighting dogs too.  

Let‚Äôs not act like we haven‚Äôt heard of Labrador retrievers Killing babies ."

You didn‚Äôt know it was out because this place only cares about drawings instead of the actual story.  If you want fast updates, this isn‚Äôt the place."

NanatsunoTaizai,fc1619u,t1_fbzwwin,1577309269.0,Some people bitch about anything.  The animation for OPM2 was fine.  Wasn‚Äôt as good as 1 but it was far from trash.
