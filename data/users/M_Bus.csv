nottheonion,ffasl4z,t1_ff9oyaw,1579743521.0,"I feel like this comment makes a mistake in terms of what is racist.

A lot of people are hesitant to call this kind of thing racist. To many, racism has to be people marching with torches shouting racist slogans or whatever. Or people openly expressing hatred for black people. But rules just like this are, in fact, racist. They actually originate with racist ideas and they selectively oppress people in specific racial categories.

It's easy to dodge responsibility for this kind of thing by claiming that it doesn't target black people - any person with hair that long would be in violation - it just happens that it applies to black people in this case.

But remember that these laws were usually made by white people, thinking of other white norms, and sometimes explicitly attempting to rule out norms from other cultures or maybe without any thought at all to other cultures or races. Consider, for example, laws that required prisoners to be clean shaven were in many cases stuck down by courts because (a) black people often have a condition whereby shaving every day is extremely painful and therefore cruel and unusual and (b) it violates inmates' religious freedom if they happen to believe that it is appropriate to grow a beard for religious reasons (as in Judaism or Islam, for example).

If I'm honest, it FEELS like overstating the case to call this blatant racism. But the law is, at best, completely silly, and the district's decision to stick to it is perfectly emblematic of white fragility and our entrenched inability to confront this kind of injustice in an honest way because we're too afraid of being called racist.

It's pathetic, is what it is. It's just the district screaming ""WE'RE NOT RACIST"" because they can't admit they're wrong and the rules they're trying to enforce are stupid."
wikipedia,fdkza5q,t1_fdkxadi,1578514241.0,"Ah! Well I guess I didn't mean to imply that god exists because logic is limited. I guess I thought I said that. I just meant what you stated already about how the notion of a god can be inserted into the necessary gap in logical reasoning without changing logic at all. It's mostly meaningless, but it's interesting at least that there is no way to close every gap."
wikipedia,fdkus3y,t1_fdkothl,1578511583.0,"[No offense, but it's kind of scientific fact!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) And, yeah, mathematicians and logicians were not super thrilled when Godel figured that out. It led to a lot of soul searching by scientists and philosophers.

Now, given that there is a logically consistent proof of this concept - that logic can demonstrate the existence of theorems that cannot be evaluated by logic OR that logic cannot be demonstrated to be internally consistent - I'm afraid you're left with two choices:

a) Godel's incompleteness theorem is correct

b) Godel's incompleteness theorem is incorrect. But in this case, since it was proven USING CONSISTENT LOGIC, we know that logic is self-inconsistent.

Doesn't look good, I'm afraid.

I mean, consider also the fact that there are an uncountably many unique true statements, but language is finite and can only express countably many true things in finite time. Consider the fact that math can prove the existence of [""uncomputable numbers""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_number) and, in fact, uncomputable numbers FAR EXCEED computable ones in number! It's not a stretch to believe that logical systems necessarily have limits. That isn't a comment about the knowability of any specific scientific ""fact,"" just about the broad limits of human reasoning. We know it's limited. We just don't know where the limit is.

That said, I agree with you about ""pointlessly believing that god exists."" I guess that's part of what I'm implying. Since all interesting logical systems can be proven to have limitations, you can (perhaps meaninglessly) put god in all of the limitations outside of the system."
wikipedia,fdkiztm,t3_elsnj6,1578504748.0,"I mean, by Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, you can basically prove (alert: hand-wavey explanation incoming) that no matter how much logic you throw at the universe, there will either be things that we have ""proven"" true that are false (or vice versa) or things that are true or false that we can't say anything about.

That is to say, logic by necessity creates gaps that can only be filled with additional axioms, i.e., beliefs.

In science (or math) those axioms are typically based on what we think represent rational conclusions based on our own observations of the known universe, but I think probably philosophically speaking there is room to argue about what constitutes a ""rational conclusion based on our observations of the known universe"" or the extent to which any base truth is ultimately observable.

So to my way of thinking, the ""god of the gaps"" philosophy is basically tautological. It starts with the necessary finiteness of human understanding and concludes that there is necessarily something that is permanently outside of human understanding. That is actually a fact (per Godel) - there are things that are permanently outside of human understanding. The only problem is... which things are they?"
statistics,fd6f1ze,t1_fd60whu,1578190000.0,"Just to add, the reason they suggest Bayesian regression is that it's mathematically equivalent to ridge regression if your prior is normal. It's a bit easier framework for understanding and for inference, but it's generally much slower because you have to use some fancy sampling techniques to fit it (e.g. pystan).

I admit that on mobile, at least, I'm having trouble following the notation exactly, but I am pretty sure that what you want to do is also okay if you're trying to maximize a penalized likelihood where the penalty is relative to a nonzero value for your coefficients."
politics,fcugl2r,t1_fcuf1v7,1577980458.0,"I feel like we're going in circles already.

The argument I'm putting forward is that the ACA was basically bipartisan legislation that republicans were desperate to get rid of NOT because it was particularly progressive but because they wanted to PAINT it as progressive. By changing the narrative, they make it SEEM like anything even resembling the ACA is a liberal paradise, when actually it is mostly a market-based solution. By making Obama seem more liberal than he is, they were trying to force democrats to be more bipartisan and less progressive overall.

Consider how much the national conversation around healthcare has changed now that some serious candidates have started speaking openly about a national healthcare system. Controlling the narrative is extremely powerful. The whole ""Obama is a super liberal"" dovetailed with the narrative wielded by republicans to attack Hillary as part of some cabal of liberal elite puppet masters.

The argument that Obama is some super-liberal figure just plays into their hands by rewriting history to make it seem like the left moved a lot further left with Obama, when in truth the right has just moved a lot further right. Obama enjoyed support of a lot of independent voters because he was a left-centrist.

I guess I would say that the right's move to the right was actually fueled in part by a cynical attempt to paint liberals as idealistic dreamers with no connection to reality and partly a result of the southern strategy.

Edit: [Here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-liberal-is-president-obama/) is a throwback article to 2011 that talks about it with a little more nuance and figures than I could bring to the table. Obama was liberal, but less so than Clinton or Carter. And if you look at the republican trend, it has been moving significantly to the right since the 1970s, a trend that continued through Obama's presidency. And the source statistical representation of liberal-conservative was updated after that [here](https://legacy.voteview.com/) and shows that while liberals have become only modestly more liberal (mainly as Southern dems join Northern dems), republicans have become significantly more polarized and radically right-wing over time. That's consistent, I think, with data showing that liberals tend to favor liberal policies no matter who is proposing them, but conservatives only favor policies (regardless of the policy) if they are proposed by people they view as being conservative."
politics,fcuei0j,t1_fcuaqjy,1577979042.0,"I'm not sure about right-wing pandering, but he was definitely a moderate. His signature legislation was about as close to bipartisan as you can get - he even took the model from Mitt Romney.

The only way Obama could be thought of as very liberal was because the right went SUPER right in response to anything he did - mostly because of racism as far as I can see.

The argument that he was very moderate was actually advanced really well in the book ""We Were Eight Years In Power"" by Ta-Nehisi Coates, which I would highly recommend to anyone.

The fact that Bernie was often aligned with Obama says to me that Bernie is a pragmatist, which I respect a lot. It doesn't say that Obama was super left."
actuary,fcj0y7g,t3_ehfm4s,1577674553.0,"As someone on the P&C side who reviews a lot of machine learning stuff: definitely not. The data is usually too ""small"" for machine algorithms to be generally applicable, and even when data is ""big,"" a lack of domain knowledge is extremely dangerous. And all the nonlinearities of ML make it a nightmare for regulators...  Point is, it's no panacea. And even if it were, still no.

No, actuaries will not be automated out any time soon. Hopefully there will be some automation that will get rid of the annoying parts of the job, but the idea that AI poses a threat is silly. If anything, actuaries will become more important as actuarial models begin to drive more business decisions, and more actuaries will be employed as a result.

Even for things that can be easily automated, for regulatory reasons, a human is always going to be there pulling the strings.

I don't see it."

My sense has been that they would make an endorsement like that in part because they want Democrats to split the vote and assume Gabbard cannot win, and partly it's to try to muddy the waters. That said, the idea that all KKK members vote Republican is probably false. I know that Republican rhetoric is SERIOUSLY xenophobic, but there are definitely racist Democrats. Fortunately, the Democratic party is at least nominally (and usually also practically) in favor of racial equality."
