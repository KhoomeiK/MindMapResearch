Eldenring,ff2yhqr,t1_ff23h1j,1579528660.0,Huh. Nice colors.
SuicideWatch,fez5utu,t3_eqy9hb,1579454081.0,"Hm. Like a riddle. Technically, there is no future at all. I see your point though. You have no motivation.  
I can help. It's a long one though and not very happy.  
I worked for an old lady a long time ago. She was very very religious and extremely bubbly all the time. She had a husband that was almost a decade younger than herself. He was also an ex-U.S. Navy SEAL and very handsome. He owned a technology office building company, they built technological offices. Very wealthy. It was like seeing a hag standing next to Superman when they were together. Very surreal.  
The old lady had a great life. Lots of money. Plenty of kids. Hot young husband. Weed, so much weed. Big ass house.  
She never talked about any of that though. She mostly talked about one of her kids. This guy, damn, he was one day hanging out with his friends. They were drinking, he wasn't, and generally just kicking back. There were some monkey-bars to play around on close by and as drunks do they decided to play. They practiced hanging upside down and jumping off, all that shit. When it came time for the son's turn he fell and cracked his spine. Bout..a 2-3 foot drop onto his head. The doctors told him that had he been drinking then the depressant would have relaxed his muscles and he would have at best a bruise on his head.  


Instead, he was paralyzed from the chest down for life. I met the old lady about 5 years after this happened. He would try to kill himself a lot over those 5 years. And she would make the 4 hour drive from her home to go see him everytime. Some were just days apart. Even when I knew her she had to leave work once to go see him because he tried to kill himself again.  


He's still alive though. He smokes hella weed and reads a lot. Even has a girlfriend. He's, understandably, still very sad about his life.  He will never leave his bed of his own will again. But, he found a way. And he is a good looking guy. Even has kind of a ""gangstah"" flare to him.  
So, that's how it goes. Is it unfair that he gets so much attention, when you get none? Yeah. He was an idiot and paid the price but now he gets a whole new life. Oh.  


Pay the price. Get your reward."
SuicideWatch,fe53xat,t1_fe50e4d,1578865450.0,"It does matter. There was this guy I met and I thought he didn't matter at all. I was 18 at the time, more than a decade ago. He looked kind of dirty and he was tall. I watched him one day while I was at work because I was high and bored on my lunch break. In the parking lot I saw him bend down by a sewer grate and in as few words he removed the grate and reached down and pulled out a kitten.  


To this day, I have no idea how a kitten got in there. How he found it. Or what the fuck. He gave it to a lady and she left with it. Then I never saw either the kitten or the man again.  
But, that guy was definitely homeless and definitely someone who has been on the low end all of his life. And yet, he has saved more kittens than I probably ever will in my entire life.  


So, just remember, it does matter. Your life can go to absolute shit but it does matter. One day your kitten will come and your chance to show off your true nature. And maybe you won't even know you did or know that anyone saw. Like that guy, no one will ever bring it up to him in his whole life again probably. But, I'll remember that thing he did. Til my last days. And all the while I will share that story with everyone I meet.  


Sorry, I am terribly long-winded. I am never going to preach to you how to feel. This is an academic exercise for us to look at the variability of situations and lives and how important each one is. In about a hour or a day you will forget most of this conversation. Because I am passing stranger and you should not hold my words with water.  
And saving a kitten is really just an example of a good thing that came from that man's long suffering.  


You will become wise if you can control your suffering. And one day you will see, like I did, that it does matter."
SuicideWatch,fe4yz2f,t3_entayx,1578864146.0,"It's ok not to care about your family.  She will be sad. I mean, some people are probably sad for you just reading this. It's human nature. Family issues are very complex, though. There are a lot of energies and societal virtues that conflict. You are what is important. If you can still contact your family then it would be wise to do so. There will be a time when you no longer have that option.  


Your belief that your mom will be sad is also a false one. Since you cannot know what she will do after you're dead. She might jump for joy. She might learn karate. It doesn't matter. See? What she thinks doesn't matter. You will not come out ahead by hurting your parent and certainly not by self-terminating because of what they put you through. They will move on as well too.  


So, we can sort of see that this ""mom will be sad"" meme is erroneous. Because you haven't self-terminated so we can't see her reaction to report it in some statistics website.  
Or you can find that one thing you like, a youtube channel or book or yelling on the internet, and do it. Hold it dear. Make it your best thing. One best thing that no one else can hold or touch.  


For me, yelling on the internet about whatever random notion crossed my mind made me very good at arguments. It also helped me vent, sweet. I am skilled in writing because I wanted to win stupid internet fights. Now, I write stories for fun that people tell me are good and I just keep writing anyway. Because, I might be able to write a story, a very good one, but it's not my thing. My thing is yelling on the internet.  


What's yours?"
SuicideWatch,fdz7r69,t1_fdxvdwp,1578787525.0,"Yeah, kind of a drag. You can start fights by stealing stuff in front of guards but civilians just run away. It's not as open-world as it seems. Every marker is pre-designated and enemies will rubber band back to their spawn point if they move too far or chase you forever which I'm sure is a glitch.

So, nothing really roams around like Monster Hunter World or Skyrim. More an action game with a decidedly illusive main story makes it seem like there is a lot of freedom but every encounter has been pre-fabricated. It's still fun though and the narrative surrounding even mundane situations will leave you slightly chilled or mystified.

There are a lot of things to find in the game, not designated by markers and will never appear on your map. Such as a mysterious pair of lovers, similar looking and dead laying next to each other. Was it a gay pair? A bet from some tavern? A doppelganger being outwitted by its prey? We never get to know. Lots of stuff like that.

Anyway, if you watch the show before you play the games you will get a better understanding of the scale and breadth of the main story coursing through all the media. It is a very good primer.

The Witcher has its main themes surrounding the idea of cyclical time and patterns present in everything. Even your quest text in the games has hidden messages. It's a very deep game but only if you enjoy sort of theory-crafting because quite a few important plot points are never resolved or are resolved in a way that leaves more questions than answers."
SuicideWatch,fdxeo01,t1_fdrfyzz,1578768025.0,"Because deep down I realized I loved myself the most out of anything in the world. I love me so I can't do it to me.  
I have had a lot of people tell me they love me. But, it always seemed lackluster.  
It was when I could truly love myself, a person I considered one of the worst, that I realized how shallow and short death is.  
I don't take offense. I have been here before 5 years ago with a different username. And I will probably leave again for awhile and come back in 5 years with another amount of shit I'd like to get off my chest. There is a power in understanding death, it is the closest opposite to life we have, you will learn the beauty of life through the tragedy of death as well.  


But, truly. I come back here also for another reason. I had a friend who did kill himself. He was only 20 years old. One of the smartest, funniest and nicest punks you'd ever meet. He died 10 years ago. His name was Bryan. I loved him a lot.  
So, I come here to see the Bryans I'll never meet and maybe I can try to talk to him through you guys.  


There it is."
SuicideWatch,fdxb6tg,t3_enanml,1578767097.0,"I know the ibuprofen mixed in will definitely fuck with things. Whiskey is not a multiplier. That is just common talk. What it really does is fucks your liver so it cannot process the other toxins as well. Thus a build up of toxins will eventually get passed your liver and into every bit of you.  
With cyanide, for example, it is constructed to immediately choke your cells, all of them, until they suffocate and die pretty much simultaneously. Imagine your whole body, every inch, suffocating.  


So, cyanide is just a very powerful toxin. The affect of your chemical cocktail will not be as immediate or as deadly but will be many times more uncomfortable. You will probably get incredibly nauseous and vomit it up then have an insane headache for awhile. Probably gotta go to the hospital at that point or you will just suffer needlessly for hours until you pass out and wake up feeling even worse.  


Don't worry about becoming a vegetable or something. Losing brain function or any of that. But, do look forward to some early dialysis or the incredibly painful death by cirrhosis of the liver."

SuicideWatch,fdx2026,t3_en9icl,1578764502.0,"I had a similar thing happen to me. Except when I was 18 they did kick me out ASAP. It was a pretty rough way to start my adult life. I know it will be hard to see it this way but your family means well even if they are blindingly ignorant. Do what they say for now. Trust me. There are way way worse things out there than submitting to your parents for a place to stay.   


I ended up at a homeless shelter that forced us to read the bible and remain sober. Which meant no smoking or anything and if they caught a whiff of it they threw your ass out and never let you back. Never happened to me but you don't want to be in a spot where anyone is forcing you to read anything.  
Love your family. To love is to listen and understand. Show your Mum some respect even for her outlandish hurtful statements and she will slowly back off.  


Don't get emotional or they will see it as being mentally unstable. You'll get through this."
SuicideWatch,fdr9srf,t3_emt8x9,1578681520.0,"I can't explain it. I can explain human nature and philosophy and science and color and etc. but the exact quality of suicide is totally unknown. No one has yet, after billions of deaths, come back to life and told us about it. Likewise, we have zero scientific instruments that can even detect an afterlife or even an aspect of that afterlife.  


So, we cannot know what it means to kill yourself versus dying naturally. Some believe they are same thing. Some believe they are both bad outcomes. All we can know for sure is that once a human being no longer is alive then they are dead. When they are dead they can no longer speak, think, love, live, dance, cry, stab, kill, learn, shoot, etc. All aspects of humanity have left their body. In time the rest of it will rot away.  


The question, in my opinion, comes down to; is being dead more advantageous for anyone than being alive?   
The answer is no.  
Death is the ultimate punishment. It's why we call it capital punishment."
SuicideWatch,fdr6xux,t3_emun15,1578680289.0,"There is a concept known as the ""fundamental attribution error"" which basically means that people will make up their own reason for someone's action rather than what is actually going on.  


An example of this is when someone gets cut off by another driver and they think ""Wow, what a jerk!"" but in reality we do not know the second driver's situation. He may have a sick child or he may just be an asshole. It doesn't really matter because the point is that we often mistake people's motivations.  


Don't mirror that fallacy back at people and they will see you as wise for your patience and respectable in demeanor. Always see the angles even for silly things. Eventually it will become easy for you and at once you will be able to use these lessons on yourself.  


You're at the best part. Finding out life is not as well shaped as we'd like and that your deeds are only calculable to yourself. You are on a good path, if you'll accept my judgement. Next, you will learn that the happy people are just the sad people who kept going."
SuicideWatch,fdr2ij3,t3_emu8n3,1578678634.0,"You're correct. Nobody does understand you. The only one with that capability is yourself. Self-help books are popular for a reason. Understanding yourself is a complex endeavor that some people will never achieve.  


But, I do commiserate with you. I have fucked up as well. It wasn't really my fault though. I learned that. Even though it seems like it's a matter of blame or fault, it's not. In a very simple way if blame falls on one person then it can just as easily fall on any other. The part of life that makes you mature is understanding that a loss can be a win and a win can be a loss. Often without you ever knowing which is which.  


I know you don't want to be talked out of it but you might consider not using an overdose. The risks are incredibly high that you will fail the self-termination and instead end up in a hospital with an impressive list of new symptoms and problems. You do not want this, some would say it is a fate worse than death.  


Isn't that interesting? ""Fate worse than death."" so, logically, there should be a ""fate better than death"", right?"
SuicideWatch,fdqyo69,t3_emtsxr,1578676892.0,"I don't think you should do it. I don't have any questions. Reading through suicide after suicide for years gave me a thorough examination on the subject. I have been to all the oldest sites and the scariest ones. I have read hundreds of suicide notes. One from 18 or younger. Ones from 18 or older.I have seen good deaths and bad deaths. I have seen blogs that have gone for years after the author self-terminated run by their parents, for decades in some cases. Posts celebrating an imaginary birthday. Maybe a mom heard their favorite song and just decided to post about it.All the famous ones too; Martin Manley(highly recommend looking at his self-published eulogy before he self-terminated), the Beautiful Death photo of the girl jumping to her death, Kurt Cobain and the numerous on-air deaths for mainstream television, long before the internet ever existed.

So, I don't think you should do it. It's been done. Do something new. Like that guy who grew his fingernails really long and got on TV. Or the youngsters who are lost and need help. They are many more than you could imagine.

Do whatever. But, the one thing I don't think you should do is it.

dauntless,fc34u0z,t3_efhtme,1577381455.0,"Actually, no, it isn't growth. It is the assimilation of a missing market. A cross-platform game will always have more players when it, not surprisingly, extends to other platforms. Would you call it community growth if we didn't allow one minority access to community actions and then we let them? No, that is some twisted and fascist logic. Which works well if you're trying to sell a point and the point being a lie you made up.  


Growth would be if there was a massive uptake in players on platforms the game already existed on but there wasn't and isn't going to be. To use the earlier analogy, consider politicians need for votes and how every group, or demographic, has a particular need. They already consider that they will get votes from every demographic so the growth in those votes is what is important.  


Adding your game onto a new console, or adding in another demographic, isn't growth. It is a desperate move to get more money for they failed to add real growth in existing markets.  


But, the point is to lie and puff up your game so I'll not disavow your intellect further."

You won't get the true lore using any wiki since it has been retconned to hell and back. The implied truth is that humans had developed an energy source that would later become aether and the animals which ate it mutated so they could survive. But, their planet did too and it is implied that the past humans did something to the core of the planet and then tried to stop it by using some type of force field.  


Just as in many games it's not super important, the setting. It's about characters. John Darnielle told me that once. Anyway, look around, see the huge spears and war torn islands? Those are not weapons used to fight Behemoths. Shit went down with some magic/technology a long time before the game takes place."

Dude.  


Try this math on for size; 100 thousand people try Dauntless on the first day. Roughly 30% will quit and never turn it back on before they fight the first boss.   


That is 30 thousand people quitting but also 30 thousand accounts staying which will count as a ""player"" for reasons that have everything to do with money.   
Now, the second day only 90k people, because it is older, will try and again 30% will quit but also another 20% will quit before they get a third of the way through but who got past the first day. Again, that is 30\~ thousand accounts left for reasons which have nothing to do with the longevity of the game.  


And so on. It's not made up numbers. I used trophy data collected from my PS4. Right now less than 15% of all PS4 players have cooked an epic cell with the middle man. That is an achievement which is hard without spending money for most people with busy lives. Though, with a small amount of money they could earn that trophy very easily.  


This means that while there were at some point many players, they have left and never completed even that small trifle. Didn't even deign to spend their money on it.  


If there truly were 15 million people playing this game then the achievement rate for that trophy, which requires some amount of time or money invested but which requires no skill would be above 50%. But, the numbers tell a different story.  
For contrast consider that only 7% of ALL Bloodborne players have gained the final boss trophy which requires much more time than the middle-man.  


Tl;dr: anyone can see that it is a dying game. Not a thriving one."
