By your logic, you get the right to choose what her online presence is because you dont like what she chooses to post for no other reason than being her partner?

Edit: another commenter said it well: you threatened to end the relationship instead of communicating your feelings to her. There are other ways to discuss things like this, like sitting down and explaining your feelings to her and seeking a solution from there. You instead told her ‚Äúif you dont do what i say, were done‚Äù.

Even if what she did was out of spite, you still broke up with her because she didnt let you control her."

You did the right thing by breaking up with her because both of you need to grow in your own ways. You obsess over her body and how she presents herself to other people and tried to control her by using your relationship as leverage.

Drawing from reference pictures from royalty free image websites is a really great way to do anatomy practice. Recreating pictures of figures in dynamic poses also helps with a further understanding of anatomy, for male or female figures. 

If you‚Äôre interested in figure drawing and drawing in exact relation to anatomy from there, my suggestion above to recreate royalty free images of humans is a really good beginning. From there, the r/drawing reddit would definitely have some people willing to help critique your work as far as expanding your expertise in figure drawing!"
