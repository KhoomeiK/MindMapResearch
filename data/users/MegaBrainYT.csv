AMA,fde7tlh,t1_fde7d4v,1578333072.0,"Hi same here, just thought some people might have questions.

So if my plans on doung something he just does it no matter what. He‘s always the first in the office. He wakes up at 4 am to do a workout and at 5 am - 5 30 he drives to work. There he works for 5 hours, has a break (where he mostly meets with clients) and then he keeps working for 10 H. After he comes home he does one more workout and then eats abd sleeps at around 9-10 pm. I think mostly doing more than everyone around really helped him and he‘s also very into these motivational speeches by Arnold schwarzenegger abd stuff. Those make him do anything..."

depression,fdcpwme,t1_fdcpgsg,1578281073.0,"It's all good I even made an r/AMA post about it, I pretty open.

After falling down I felt a mix of relief and a strong wave off emptiness. I was happy bc something told me that I wasn't ready to die yet and I could work thru it.

I regreted it but also felt like things weren't fixed. When I have these phases it feels like everything I already achieved just didn't work 

Right now I don't want to try again and hope I won't ever try but that's the same way I felt after my first time so let's hope I fin a solution but until then I just keep writing bc it really makes me feel better :)

 Glad you liked it <3"

AMA,fdc1dai,t1_fdbxyqu,1578265204.0,"To be totaly honest, lately there aren't really a lot of thing that I cherish in life. The money my family has isn't really a thing that makes me happy or sad. Essentially when I think about it the things in life that really matter to me are that my dog, nothing makes me more happy than her and I like that it's something that is available for anyone :D I know that if you don't have as much money it's something you wanna have. So I think the best thing is to actualy notice that you don't need material things and you can find happiness in things that everyone can have ;)

edit: I know how it is when you don't have a lot of money. When I grew up my family lived in a 2 bedroom apartment and we didnt have a lot of money and there I always wanted to have a lot of money."
