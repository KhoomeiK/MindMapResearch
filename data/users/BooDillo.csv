usatravel,fdp1052,t1_fdp0twe,1578617432.0,"So Washington, Oregon, colorado, Utah, etc most of those states are a lot of outdoorsy type stuff unless you stick to the cities. Lots of hiking camping etc."
usatravel,fdlrs41,t3_elylx1,1578530953.0,What kind of things interest you? How long is this trip? Our public transportation isnt great unless you plan on being in the same large city the whole stay.
Chonkers,fd9mnpu,t3_ejzhdx,1578235370.0,I require more of gato Fred
cats,fd963ct,t1_fd6zwo1,1578228965.0,So much truth.
clothdiaps,fd6i8g6,t1_fd6hukd,1578191434.0,Yeah we usually dont. We usually just put an insert on top of the pocket however at night we stuff.
cactus,fd6a52e,t1_fd69nh6,1578187855.0,"Really? The windows are quite large, about 5 feet by 5 feet. I should have mentioned that"
clothdiaps,fd66rw4,t1_fd5wt1m,1578186345.0,I don't wash the whole thing every time. Maybe I'm wrong but i only wash the diaper itself when it is wet or soiled otherwise I reuse the cover like you would for just a cover diaper with an insert. I use our pockets with a microfiber in the pocket then a cotton insert on top.
ireland,fd629tb,t3_ek0g9g,1578184560.0,I think i have this same spot photo from our first trip over there. It's hanging above our telly in our living room.
cactus,fd620rm,t1_fd60uoo,1578184453.0,I live near Tampa isnt quite that predictable foe rain but no i was thinking to just leave them in the garage. I too use about 50% perilite about 25% sand/pebbles and 25% soil.
cats,fd61n7i,t3_ek36w2,1578184288.0,Adorable. There seems to be an assumption here that you can control a cat and make it not roll in whatever the fuck it wants to. Hmm. These people must not have cats.
clothdiaps,fd4zui2,t3_ejz6xx,1578172777.0,There is an Aldi about 40 minutes from me and im willing to go there if theyre fairly priced and decent. I like alvababy a lot but im willing to get other brands.

moderatelygranolamoms,fcsqvng,t3_eioztn,1577922818.0,"I live near Tampa. I can say there are some up and coming areas, however i dont frequent the beach and im not super crunchy or liberal so you need to look in the more hipster areas. Seminole Heights in tampa is going through gentrification and is becoming a more ""hip"" place, I would suggest contacting someone from Community Roots Collective in Tampa and asking their opinion. I live about 30 minutes north of Tampa and in my city its mostly rednecks and snowbirds. A lot of florida is like that though plus a lot of homeless depending on the area. Definitely find a job here before you move because the job market is very iffy a lot of people move here assuming we have tons of jobs but thats not true."
beyondthebump,fcbbfmb,t3_egwp5m,1577584813.0,This is so true. This makes me feel badly however I know that I have more opportunities to improve just dealing with a 1 year old thinking he's a full blown toddler is difficult.
