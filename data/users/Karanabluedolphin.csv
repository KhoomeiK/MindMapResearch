AskReddit,ffeae5h,t1_ffdxtc2,1579841180.0,That’s “Shall we play a game”. I thought about that too.
AskReddit,ffeacfo,t3_esyko6,1579841139.0,May the odds be ever in your favor.
AskReddit,ffddf8f,t3_esse9d,1579818543.0,"It was 1977 and I was 7 or 8 and my mom picked up a stranger. And old man carrying home groceries in very hot weather.  When we reached the man’s home he thanked my mother for the ride and offered me a candy bar since she would not accept money. I very much wanted it because we didn’t often get candy, but I was afraid to take it. My mom said it was okay. 
It was a “ZERO” candy bar and they became my favorites for a long time."

StarWars,ffdc20s,t1_ffd292d,1579817682.0,How disappointing. Thanks for the heads up.
StarWars,ffcrz3n,t1_ffcrnnv,1579806041.0,"I am a hick from the sticks. It is literally 125 miles to the nearest comic book store. That’s why I was looking online in the first place. But, I have a daughter that lives in a big city so she may be drafted into looking for me.

Edit: I looked up midtown comics and found an app. Is that what you meant?"
StarWars,ffcrbxg,t1_ffcp0yr,1579805655.0,Amazon is asking $25. I think I’ll keep looking.

reylo,ffb5gzp,t3_esmg1d,1579752307.0,"Heartbreakingly beautiful, but it stopped so abruptly, just like the character it was made for.  I didn’t know how much I need this theme till I heard it."
starwarsspeculation,ff540vd,t3_ern3ia,1579579621.0,Exactly my thoughts!  That was the absolutely best part of it for me! And when it was done I stayed in the theater sobbing until the very last word of the credits rolled. Not ready for it be over!
reylo,ff2yc4z,t1_ff2lpx0,1579528523.0,Or the more appropriate response... what I said is true.....”from a certain point of view”.

I’m just making a parallel."
reylo,ff2xnhy,t1_ff2lpx0,1579527899.0,True enough. But he never would have been in that position in the first place if he hadn’t gone after power.
AskReddit,fefu3zm,t3_eou6il,1579065255.0,I’ve been wishing to meet the cast of Star Wars for 40 years. I would still like to do that.

Showerthoughts,fcpcaar,t3_ei864s,1577858011.0,"My husband is a work-a-holic. He has his own mechanic shop and usually works 8am-10pm 6 days a week and midnight is not unusual. 
He tends to work late because during the day phone calls and customers interrupt his work. Late at night when everyone is gone is when he gets the most accomplished. Once he gets on a roll he hates to stop. And since he doesn’t get paid till a job is finished, stopping to come home feels like delaying his income. 
The other thing is his personality... when he is not working on something he gets grumpy. He wanders around looking for things to fix/do.  Sometimes he just doesn’t know when to shut it down.

PS: we have been married for almost 32 years, think if homelife  was so bad that he need to avoid us, we probably wouldn’t have made it this long."
Showerthoughts,fcpbi63,t1_fcp0igx,1577857194.0,Sometimes circumstances change. Maybe they could afford the children when they had them and then lost a job or something.  Can you guarantee that you will have the job/ income you have now or want 5-10 years down the road?

aww,fcp3ic3,t3_eia3rl,1577849344.0,Have you never heard the saying “Two shakes of a lambs tail”? It’s an idiom for something that can be done quickly.
aww,fc7l4cl,t1_fc4qntn,1577510949.0,"I think it was meant to be a fireplace insert. But we just use it as a fireplace. It used to have glass in the doors, but after the glass got broken we replaced with sheet iron."

aww,fc5utgl,t1_fc4w9l3,1577466384.0,"Name is still being debated by the kids. We never name a new pet right away because I like to wait to see if a personality trait shows us a name. Also had been waiting to see if anyone near us was missing a cat and didn’t want to get attached by naming if he wasn’t staying.

Current names being considered....
It is a male

Ming Ming (daughter’s suggestion)
Sashimi  (son’s suggestion) our other cat is named Sushi
Hermy (Husbands’s suggestion) 

I haven’t found a name I’m happy with enough to put into the vote."

aww,fc5twt0,t1_fc4t9n7,1577465794.0,He was definitely someone’s cat before he showed up . I know he was eating good. But no one has claimed him and so he just became another family member.
aww,fc5tp4h,t1_fc4t92x,1577465654.0,It used to have glass in the doors many years ago. But logs rolled into them and broke them so they were replaced with cast iron. That is why we have to have the doors open if we want to watch the fire.

aww,fc5sxin,t1_fc4wpcv,1577465157.0,"Actually, the old and bones hurting sounds more like my husband than the cat. Hubby sometimes sits down there to warm up when he come home and yes sometimes even dozed off."

House does not have central heat/air. Kitchen-dining sea and living room are heated by wood stove in winter and swamp cooler in summer. Bedrooms are heated by electric oil radiators and only heated when in use."

Idk how old he is, but I suspect not quite fully grown."
aww,fc5renp,t1_fc4p2bq,1577464255.0,We have had other cats off and on over the years. None of them have every jumper on the stove when it was going. A few have jumped on it cold. I believe the heat is uncomfortably warm even from a distance to their senses. They draw back from it just like you would.
aww,fc5r42l,t1_fc4osn5,1577464095.0,He usually moves to the human bed when we turn everything off for the night. Hasn’t been interested in the cat bed at all.
aww,fc5qor3,t1_fc4ospt,1577463867.0,"Yes, desperately. But have let the kids off chores the last 2 days while we have been Christmasing. That spot it on a direct path from the front door to the kitchen and gets shmutz tracked in faster than you can imagine.
Edit: we vacuum around the hearthstones area when fire is not going so we don’t suck up any live coals and start a fire in the vacuum cleaner."

aww,fc5ps0q,t1_fc5ah5x,1577463359.0,That’s exactly why we have the bricks. However we have had coals pop out farther than the hearth. So we don’t leave the doors open unattended.

My aunt survived polio as a child. They tell how my  grandfather massage her legs and worked them every day, even when she cried, so that she didn’t become crippled.
My dad talks about  a bad drought in the 50s.  How they would hang wet sheets over the doors and windows to catch the blowing sand. And even so it ended up in the beds and inside the refrigerator."
