The Switch and BOTW brought me back, and I also want to say Mario Odyssey is a fantastic game that is neck and neck with my favorite on the system. I also got a chance to play all the games I missed when I wasn't gaming, such as Dark Souls, Skyrim, and (currently) Witcher 3. It's so liberating being able to play them in bed right before I got to sleep, or to take them with me when I travel.

One of the only reasons Ozuna is so highly regarded is because he had one really, really stellar season in 2017. That was the only season he finished with an OBP that wasn't in the .320's (with an admittedly stellar .376 OBP). He also clubbed 37 HR that season, which explains why he generated 5.8 WAR.

Outside of that one amazing season, Ozuna has put up fairly pedestrian numbers. Yes, he has a bit of power, but he really can't get on base. In case you don't know, an OBP below .330, which Ozuna has done every year except 2017, is considered average at best. .340 is solid, .360 is very good, and anything above that is great.

I don't know, I just don't see why Ozuna is seen as some kind of great savior on offense, when in reality he's only ever-so-slightly above average thanks to a little extra power. His OPS+ the last two seasons were 106 and 107, 100 is considered league average.

You think it's worth paying $18 million for slightly above average offense and poor defense?

I think this article sums it up well:

>As we all well know, the free-agent landscape has been notoriously cruel over the last two years, and Ozuna feels like a player who could be strongly affected by the evolving market. As a bat-first left fielder nearing his thirties, teams might be reluctant to invest heavily in a profile that depends mostly on offensive production—which, generally speaking, has been underwhelming since Ozuna joined the Cardinals.

>Another point of concern will be Ozuna’s defensive shortcomings. Although there’s a Gold Glove Award on his mantle, Ozuna has provided little value as an outfielder since departing Miami. He grades as below-average in Statcast’s outs above average and outfielder jump metrics—ranking in the 13th and 29th percentile, respectively. On the positive side, he is credited with 2 DRS, thanks in large part to a strong throwing arm. That’s not a bad mark at all, but teams may be hesitant to project that performance into his thirties as he seeks a multi-year deal.

I dunno, I've always considered myself more of an '80s kid. I don't consider teen years to be a ""kid"" any more, so I say my ""childhood memories"" really go from '84 to about '94, then I became a teen and got into grunge, gansta rap, started watching more mature movies like ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Clerks"" and so on (the first ""R"" rated movie I remember my whole family watching together at home was Terminator 2 when it was still new, so I guess that was probably '92 when I was 11).

On a final note, my parents were born in '47 and '49, so I feel like they provided different cultural touchstones for me and my sisters compared to most of our friends who had parents who were born in the mid-to-late 50's. Our parents were 50's kids and the perfect age to get caught up in the hippie counter-culture movement that swept through universities, while most of our friends parents were still in middle and high school while all that was going on.

So yeah, all of this is to say, there can be other factors involved that just your birth year to help figure out where your cultural touchstones come from."

One time, she was cutting vegetables in the kitchen, and I walked behind her to get some water from the fridge. Just as I was about to open the door, she turned and was going to get something from the fridge too, then she saw me, gasped/scremed, raised the knife, and I seriously thought she was about to bury the carving knife right in my skull.

No, it's not. It's the definition YOU chose to apply to make you argument.

Is the only thing that differentiates a ""smart"" fridge from a ""dumb"" fridge a touchscreen? Or does it need to connect to wifi be considered ""smart""?

gout,feu0j5e,t3_eqlkoe,1579381923.0,"I have honestly never heard of anyone having UA levels that high.

You are probably going to have to go on a fairly high dose eventually (500+mg)to really bring your UA levels down, and it's going to take time to build up to that.

That said, you made the right choice getting on Allo. It was inevitable, and it has shown great results in helping people control their gout, no matter their starting point. The next few months aren't going to be fun, but make sure you are taking colchicine and also have access to ibuprofen/naproxen, as well as an emergency stash of prednisone for the really dark days if/when they come. You might not start seeing real progress until early summer, but STICK WITH IT. You have to nip this in the bud now, or it's only going to get worse.

Drink lots and lots of water. Uric acid is excreted through urine, so you want to make sure your kidneys are constantly working and flushing the bad stuff out of your system. Also, get plenty of sleep. Stress is a huge factor that can lead to gout attacks, and not getting enough sleep can trigger the release of the stress hormone which in turn can lead to elevated UA levels. Also try to do some light exercise every day, like walking a mile or two or taking some stairs. Keeping you blood moving will help keep the UA crystals moving, and hopefully they will be broken down and excreted through your kidneys sooner rather than later.

Long story short, you're not screwed, but you very likely have some rough months ahead of you. But if you take what I said to heart, you have a good chance of minimising the negative impacts. Always remember: The darkest hour is just before dawn. Get through this, and get it under control, then get on with your life.

Good luck!"

If I had to guess, I would say Samsung is going to go to an alternating release schedule for watches, Galaxy Watch in even number years, Galaxy Watch Active in odd number years.

I think in general, people are less inclined to upgrade their watches than they are their phones, so Samsung wants to keep the watches on the market as long as possible before offering an upgraded version.

That's just my guess, though, maybe they'll surprise us. I agree with you, the only thing holding back the Galaxy Watch from being the perfect watch (besides lack of apps) is the baffling low amount of storage. Even 16 GB would be great, and it seems like that should be very doable without bumping up the price much. Everything else about the watch is already perfect, although if they made it 1 or 2 mm thinner, that would also be awesome."
