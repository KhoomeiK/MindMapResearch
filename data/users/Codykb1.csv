medlabprofessionals,ffmdd8j,t3_eu3b3f,1580052840.0,Just print out a “that would be great” meme and slap it somewhere relevant! I did that when people wouldn’t put open dates on shit and it helped a bit lol.
medlabprofessionals,fff61jj,t1_fff5knh,1579876617.0,"oh wow, i wasn't expecting a big city! that's awesome! I'm down in Columbus, I know there's always openings at the big hospitals here but I haven't heard anything about sign on bonuses.  We were happy just to get a nice market adjustment last summer."
medlabprofessionals,fff397q,t1_ffevsdx,1579874520.0,"where in ohio did you get a signing bonus? i get a lot of recruiters pitching me on Zanesville with a relocation/signing bonus, i think for Genesis Health care?"
medlabprofessionals,fff34eu,t3_et9brh,1579874415.0,"I just filed my taxes, my gross income was \~$50k.  We got a $3/hr market adjustment in july 2019 that bumped that up a bit.  My hourly is \~$23/hr.  MLT with 7 years of experience.  No bachelors degree is holding me back, but whatevs.  I'm in Columbus, OH."
49ers,ff75qsh,t3_es0tjc,1579641660.0,I remember this take after running the ball down the Vikings throat. Only 8 pass plays against GB. He for sure has some stuff that hasn’t been on film all season.

medlabprofessionals,fencaef,t3_epy3d5,1579281615.0,"My schedule is awesome, I only work a handful of weekends a year and about one holiday, the other holidays i get PTO (of which there are 10 because I work for the state).  I get a pension (although i can't see myself staying here for the full 32 year service, you get reduced benefits starting at year 5).  The benefits here are pretty good, health and education wise.

My Manager and leads are awesome.  I don't really get excited about lab work anymore but I enjoy my coworkers a lot.  This is huge for me.  The work feels somewhat meaningful, since I'm in flow and we deal a ton with leukemias and lymphoma's, as well as bone marrow transplant testing.  Before this I was in Toxicology, and after awhile I felt like the testing I did was not very important clinically."
aww,fellkkl,t3_epnbwl,1579225079.0,"Thanks, ill keep this in mind!"
aww,fellg0c,t3_epnbwl,1579224993.0,He was hanging around us eating treats and gave my gf’s finger a sniff tonight so some head scratching might be soon!
aww,felcmzq,t1_felbi7k,1579219043.0,This is good to hear!
aww,felc59h,t1_felbxu4,1579218719.0,There’s been no attempts at touching yet. Currently on the second attempt of just hanging out with soft food as a motivator and it’s working!
aww,felbqk6,t1_fel8rlj,1579218448.0,"Awe good on you! I worry about some thing being hardwired, I’m hopeful that him being 7 months is a positive in this regard. 

He’s due for a vet trip next week because he had an ear infection when we adopted him, I’m not looking forward to trying to get him in a crate :("
aww,felbgws,t1_fel8kew,1579218273.0,We are trying to establish that association for sure!
aww,fel45ov,t1_fekypm3,1579213667.0,"It’s only been two weeks, right now we flip flop between just completely giving him his space (the spare room is all his) or spending time in the room so he gets used to us there. If we peek around to see him in his spot he usually gives us a little hiss and then meow.   

This morning felt like a breakthrough when we put out some soft food and sat on the floor away from it, not facing towards to him. After awhile he actually did come out, took a quick few bites and then back to his spot lol. But he came back out a minute later and ate the whole plate!"
aww,fekj706,t1_fekhraa,1579201161.0,"awe thanks!  We just have to keep telling ourselves to be patient, we just want to love him!"
aww,fekj4br,t3_epnbwl,1579201117.0,"Could you share your experience taking in this sweetie? I rescued a feral from the shelter that's 7 months, I've had him for 2 weeks now and he is still shy around my girlfriend and I.  We are trying to coax him out of his hiding spot to eat soft food in the room while we're in there.  We have a pet cam and he does all the normal kitty stuff when we're not around, but won't give any attention to toys or catnip or treats when we're in there.  any advice would be appreciated!"
aww,fekh3bt,t3_epm4dg,1579199909.0,"2 weeks after adoption and my shelter cat still wants nothing to do with us, but we got him to come out and eat with us in the same room so there's progress!  He was a feral and went straight to the shelter, only 7 months old so hopefully we can condition him to loving us as much as we love hims :D"
