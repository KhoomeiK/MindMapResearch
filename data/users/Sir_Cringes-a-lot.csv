I scribble down the first alphabet of every letter (including a small intelligible line continuing with it) while listening to the lectures, this makes me concentrate on the exact words uttered. Hence, I'm able to answer every question they ask since most of the ""Listening Section"" questions are basically up to the point. However, questions associated with Conversations are quite easier, just assume the people in the convo as your classmates and get that eavesdropping vibe. In case, when I'm stuck with ""second guesses"", I recall the convo ask myself which option seems more appropriate, because after you do this you'll be left with an impression which cannot change no matter what (believe me, I basically get the questions correct while following this).

ToeflAdvice,fcxgdvh,t3_eje2ga,1578062243.0,"alright! I suck at Reading too, but Listening is particularly easy for me. I follow few ridiculous techniques which may seem extremely ridiculous to you.

I scribble down the first alphabet of every letter (including a small intelligible line continuing with it) while listening to the lectures, this makes me concentrate on the exact words uttered. Hence, I'm able to answer every question they ask since most of the ""Listening Section"" questions are basically up to the point. However, questions associated with Conversations are quite easier, just assume the people in the convo as your classmates and get that eavesdropping vibe. In case, when I'm stuck with ""second guesses"", I recall the convo ask myself which option seems more appropriate, because after you do this you'll be left with an impression which cannot change no matter what (believe me, I basically get the questions correct while following this). I get 91-97% in Listening while doing the Official Tests that they provide with the Official ETS books.
