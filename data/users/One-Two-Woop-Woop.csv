pcmasterrace,ffunmaw,t3_ev6lit,1580245746.0,The gameplay looks extremely pedestrian. It's a tech demo at best... The gimmick is neat to look at but looks incredibly dull to actually play... I mean the stick death era had more interesting gameplay on web browsers.

news,fdmc6ky,t1_fdl625n,1578545281.0,"The one on forensics has some incredibly incorrect conclusions about fingerprints. The Mayfield case (and every other case they bring up) are gross human error. There's nothing wrong about the science, it's only when it's incorrectly applied. Fingerprint comparison science (or ridgeology) is foundationally valid as determined by many independent scientific bodies, including PCAST.

The criticisms on lie detectors and eye witness testimony may be valid but none of it is forensic science... So that in itself is massively misleading as forensic science only deals with physical evidence.

If you also look up the sources of their information, none of it is from a scientifically published journal. They basically found one time that people massively fucked up and said ""see!!! The science is wrong!!!"" It's a travesty that the show did not redact that episode as it taints jurors."

First, I'm not a cop. Second, you have stated ""facts"" without supporting evidence. Third, when confronted with actual evidence you run away.

Stop spreading lies from your blogs. Do a little research with actual scientific journals and textbooks. If you want a good starter text try The fingerprint sourcebook. It's free and online. Careful though, it's provided by the ""government"". So shady, I know. I'm sure your sources are way more reliable."
todayilearned,fcuqgep,t1_fctp3sx,1577986427.0,"You have the burden of proof to provide actual scientific evidence that the science is not sound. You made that claim. I have literal hundreds of years of peer reviewed and published studies and you have a claim that it's junk based on.... Oh wait based on basically nothing.

If you can't back up your claims with actual peer reviewed articles then don't spew lies. The problem isn't with forensic science itself, it's with the inappropriate application of the science by unqualified people or overstatement of facts. If you bothered reading any ACTUAL criticisms, those which are published and peer reviewed instead of blogs, you would know that.

I've already posted a list of issues with some of the field from a Presidential Council. You should start your reading there and see what changes have been made post PCAST. I'll introduce you to OSAC next. The PCAST already outlines what areas are deemed scientifically valid by third parties (note that these were deemed valid by people outside the forensic science field, like your absolute bullshit post claimed never happens)."
todayilearned,fctkcyq,t1_fctdtav,1577946401.0,"He's clearly trying to spread the same bullshit that gets put on reddit all the time by idiots who watch an episode of Adam ruins everything and think they know everything about hundreds of years of tested science. Yes, the application of forensics has been shoddy - and that has clearly been shown. The actual science behind it has merit and has been tested. This is why it still holds in court.

If anyone is doubtful of the findings they can start their own study, publish it and become billionaires. But no, clearly it is just some huge conspiracy from ""big forensics"" lmao."
todayilearned,fct454l,t1_fcsw2lu,1577932399.0,"Lmao and where is your source for this? Let me guess, some ridiculous website with a .net affix written on an obscure blog. Do you even know how ""science"" is published? It goes in appropriate journals. If anyone wants to discredit them they can review the work and make a rebuttal.

Don't begin to talk about forensics when you don't understand the basic premises of it. The forensic investigation is separate from the police investigation. The forensic exam is independent and collects physical evidence to show who was at the crime scene.

If you really want to attack forensics, at least attack the ones that are proven to be faulty due to overstatement of fact (which is human error, not one with the science). This is hair/fiber, bitemark and possibly toolmark impression evidence. The rest of it stands vigor as it properly follows scientific principals.

If you want a crappy review of it using ""scientists"" who weren't related to the field of forensics (as they didn't both consulting forensic examiners to do it):
