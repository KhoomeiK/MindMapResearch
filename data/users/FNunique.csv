MarvelStrikeForce,ffgmp7i,t1_ffglser,1579909812.0,"Yeah but I like to take its time, in blitz mostly so I don't have to worry about time.

 Plus x3 w/dynamic camera on kinda hurts my eyes with all the quick movements

Edit: Also noticed that the audio and movements of toons get out of synch when in x3 with audio on"
MarvelStrikeForce,ffgk1i4,t3_ethobp,1579908022.0,"I agree with you. Sometimes I like to play with the sound on and x1 speed, just to see the occasional fightcut scene, and there's certain levels that just kill your speakers or ears. It deafening! I figured after all these updates it would've been fixed but alas, nothing."

StarWars,ffdxxk0,t1_ffdjh6r,1579831683.0,I thought it got destroyed in TFA after they shoot off Starkiller base? It was a small scene but I could've swore it showed a cityscape like Coruscant but I could be remembering wrong.

news,fessri6,t1_feshbi7,1579368642.0,I know what video you're talking about. Have a group chat that my friends and I send dark memes. Had a buddy forward that video with no context and definitely was gnarly.
StarWars,febmcu9,t1_febkh2b,1578960353.0,"I see it more as the end of the Skywalker prophecy and hopefully an open to a new prophecy or material. Something different than what's been given in the span of three trilogies. That's why I liked Solo, Rogue One, and The Mando, same universe but different stories. I can see where trouble could arise with 'Grey' Jedi coming across light and siding with them but there are extremists in the SW universe. Who's to say there isn't a light sided extremists? I mean Saw Guerra was that type wasn't he?"
StarWars,febllkq,t3_eocqto,1578960044.0,"No, to me it doesn't capture the StarWars feeling. They play the same tropes from the original (Death Star/Starbase Killer and there's a scene in TRoS but no spoilers. The Mandolrian on the other hand breathes the SW universe by reintroducing old, forgotten concepts (like the 70's era trooper transport toy) and bringing new life to it."
