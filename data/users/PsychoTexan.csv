You’re simply removing a balancing mechanic by pressing the 2 key and negating the strength of opposing tanks for absolutely no trade off in performance. Its like arguing that the type 5 heavy needed the extra damage gold rounds because HE damage is heavily RNG based. FFS what is the opposing heavy supposed to do. Go hull down against 334mm pen? This is higher pen than the gold rounds on most T10 light, medium, and heavy tanks. His only defense is to not be seen.

TankPorn,ffasuch,t1_ffalyvl,1579743690.0,"Eh not that bad really. The whole Soviet heavy tank line was designed for a different era. The armor was good but that’s not enough and the sacrifices made for the armor and gun spelled the doom of the series. The biggest impact that the IS series had on the post war world was spurring the main gun requirements of MBTs from 90mm to 105mm and finally to 120mm/125mm. 


A quick example: 

“During the early 1950s, all IS-3s were modernized as IS-3M models. The Egyptian Army acquired about 100 IS-3M tanks from the Soviet Union. During the Six-Day War, a single regiment of IS-3M tanks was stationed with the Egyptian 7th Infantry Division at Rafah and the 125th Tank Brigade of the 6th Mechanized Division at Kuntilla was also equipped with about 60 IS-3M tanks. Israeli infantry and paratrooper units had considerable difficulty with the IS-3M when it was encountered due to its thick armor, which shrugged off hits from normal infantry anti-tank weapons such as the bazooka. Even the 90 mm AP shell fired by the main gun of the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) M48 Patton tanks could not penetrate the frontal armor of the IS-3s at normal battle ranges. There were a number of engagements between the M48A2 Pattons of the IDF 7th Armored Brigade and IS-3s supporting Egyptian positions at Rafah in which several M48A2s were knocked out in the fighting.

However, in one engagement between a battalion of IS-3s and 90 mm gun-armed M48A3's, seven IS-3s were destroyed. The slow rate of fire, poor engine performance (the engine was not well suited to hot-climate operations), and rudimentary fire control of the IS-3s proved to be a significant handicap, and about 73 IS-3s were lost in the 1967 war. Most Egyptian IS-3 tanks were withdrawn from service, though at least one regiment was retained in service as late as the 1973 October war. The IDF itself experimented with a few captured IS-3M tanks, but found them ill-suited to fast-moving desert tank warfare; those that were not scrapped were turned into stationary defensive pillbox emplacements in the Jordan River area. “"

tanks,ff4045k,t3_ere8bi,1579552634.0,"Okay so I couldn’t find any penetration tests but I did the math. I am on mobile so I’ll describe it. I got my numbers by using a projectile motion calculator with air resistance, the muzzle velocities of the 6 cwt and 7cwt, and the AP ammo penetration tests of the 7 cwt. 


I used the max elevation, muzzle velocity, and max range of the 7 Cwt to find the drag on the shell and made the assumption that both 6 pndr AP rounds would share similar drag. (A)

Calculated the final velocities for the 7 cwt at the penetration ranges tested. Calculated the final v for the 6 cwt using the drag from (A) at each of the 7 cwt penetration test ranges. (B)

So sue me I assumed a linear model for the 7 cwt final velocities vs penetration. I know it’s not linear but it’s the best I can do on mobile. Applied that model to the numbers from (B) to produce my final results for the 6 cwt. 

500m ~47mm

1000m ~35mm

1500m ~26.6mm

2000m ~19.2mm
