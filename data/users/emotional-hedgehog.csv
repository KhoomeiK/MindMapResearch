AskReddit,ff3j2jp,t1_ff3in5v,1579542111.0,Disagree. Most men peak around 25-30. 20 is very  young and a lot of men still look more like boys than men at that age.
AskReddit,ff3ivwc,t3_ergguz,1579541996.0,"24. In my country I'd been driving and legally drinking for 6 years by that point. It's still young, but not so young that you get treated like a kid. Also, it's not so old yet, that people expect you to have your life together, be married, or have children. 24 is a good year to enjoy adulthood without having too much pressure of other people's expectations. Also, it was a good year for my skin."

Bit girly, I know, but you just have to find the things that work for you. And, the most important thing, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, check their social media."
