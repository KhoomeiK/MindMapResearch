MultipleSclerosis,fedkdgl,t3_eohjt1,1579013708.0,"Do you live in the US?  If so, they cannot just cancel your insurance.  If you request it, they must offer you COBRA coverage.  It is where you would have to pay the premium, but you can keep your insurance for a period of time after you leave your job.  Not a lot of consolation if you don't have the money to pay the premiums...but, if you are just afraid of not being able to have your MRI, this could help.  But, YOU have to initiate it.  In other words, you have to tell your employer you want it and contact the insurance co to sign the paperwork required."
MultipleSclerosis,fedim8l,t3_eoh7rq,1579012476.0,"I think you are going to do ok.  Anyone that cares enough to seek out ways to better themselves in order to help...that's #1 in my book.

Anyway, the first advice I could give would be to just understand EVERYDAY is different.  She does not know how she will feel tomorrow and planning things in advance will become very stressful for her (at some point as it progresses) because she will not want to cancel at the last minute when she feels bad and can't attend.  Patience. Understanding. Kindness (even when she is not being very nice to you...you know, turn the other cheek thing ;).

Good luck and I believe you are starting out right...I will pray for you and her."

My friend got bit on her thigh and ended up having to have a softball size chunk removed...after 2 months at 'this stage'.  She now has a massively deformed thigh.  Yes, she could have plastic surgery, she doesn't want to, it doesn't bother her to look like someone shot her with a shotgun at close range."
MultipleSclerosis,fcxvee6,t3_ejffx4,1578071036.0,"Welcome to my world!  I am cold, but I know if I bundle up at bedtime, I will wake up with my sheets and night clothes literally wet (and its not urine, lol).  I frequently wake with my legs and sometimes my arms seemingly frozen, no feeling, ice cold, numb and unable to move.  Then, after a minute or two the feeling begins to return and it is all ok...and my sheets are usually wet from sweat...insane.  Sometimes it happens during the day, I will get insanely hot in a split-second, strip off as much clothing as I can, turn off the heat and turn a fan on...then back to freezing in a few minutes.  The 'hot' is so miserable, I tend to leave my house pretty cold and just put a heating pad on me for warmth..."

conspiracy,fc3r99o,t3_eg01by,1577396615.0,"Worse than that...not only will they not release any drug that could 'cure' a disease, if they find out someone else has found something promising...they will force them to sell to them (and then put that research under lock and key) and/or the person will be literally run out of the country or mysteriously die and all their research disappear."
cats,fc3pe04,t3_efzgqj,1577395307.0,"I got my cats one of those...2 years ago.  We left it in the den for over a year and finally gave up...they don't like it apparently.  No idea why, we moved it to many different locations, including right in front of the heater, which they love...no dice, they both hated it.  Maybe it had been returned and smelled like another animal or something?  No idea."

conspiracy,fc3b85j,t3_efvqg9,1577385918.0,"Since way, way back, like the 50's (not sure when, but it has been a long time) they have taken a foot print and sample of blood of every baby born in a hospital in the US.  They don't ask, they just bring your baby back to you and there is a bandaid on their foot...and the certificate has a picture of the footprint."
