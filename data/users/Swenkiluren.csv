ShouldIbuythisgame,ffi7sue,t3_etnqjd,1579967327.0,"Garry's mod. A sandbox and a roleplay game for like €10 off sale. It has workshop too, it is literally an endless sandbox. I personally put 3600 hours in to it, and I don't regret a second of it. Plenty of players and gamemodes. Whether you end up rp'ing on one of the many many many options such as DarkRP, StarwarsRP, MilitaryRP or more questionable ones like MethRP and *SchoolShooterRP*, or just play singleplayer or multiplayer sandbox with friends, this game has it all and plenty to spare. If you like Sandbox or RP, this game is a must have for your Steam library."
