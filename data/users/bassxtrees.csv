When i got what i thought was some decent gear together, any time i got a light upgrade, i had to buy a module from gunsmith. I was perpetually strapped for recourses. With how random gear stats are, swapping pieces out for the new one was not really an option unless you are one of those guys who dont care much about optimizing. Iv since gotten past that ordeal, but the clunkiness of it all is memorable."

However, on two especially shitty days, the notes were exactly what i needed to pull through. Iv tossed out a countless number of them, before and since, but i cant part with either of those.
