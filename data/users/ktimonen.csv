aww,fem1kzb,t1_fel8pj9,1579236782.0,They are okay now that they are in a safe place. Unfortunately their moms probably died in the fires that have been ravishing Australia
USPS,fekzkc6,t3_epq07r,1579210878.0,Your drivers license is fine no matter where you actually are staying but you will need another form on non-photo ID like vehicle registration or a voter's card for example.
Horses,feirwao,t3_ep8wf3,1579145646.0,I lost my best friend this past August due to an impaction in his intestines. A total chance thing to happen. I got Dream when I was 10 and he was 3 or 4 and had him for 15 years in May. I bragged to everyone how I would have him for at least another 10. I grew up with him as he did me. We were so in touch with one another. I trusted him %100 even when he was bratty. I know I won't have another like him and that's a hard truth to swallow. It's hard trying not to compare other horses to him either. I'd trade mt best day to ride him one last time.

USPS,fechw5q,t3_eof2dw,1578974310.0,"I am a PSE and love it. I work in a super small town though so I have my own office and only have one carrier out of it. I literally get paid to read and watch netflix once my mail is sorted. But if it's for a bigger office, it could be a totally different ball game. I only know how the small town offices work."

USPS,fdpicqq,t3_emkcup,1578629420.0,I have a customer who checks his PO box once every month if that. Well his box rent was due and obviously he didn't get the notices because he doesn't check his mail so his mail box got closed and all his mail sent back. Oooo did he suddenly find the time to come to the office and yell and me how it was my fault he wasn't informed and i should have at least called him to tell him🙄🤦🏼‍♀️

Along with monetary donations, I have seen a donation page where you can knit, sew, or crochet little pouches for bats, koalas, and joeys and send them to a place in Australia. I don't know the exact site because my boss showed me, but she just googled it and found free patterns and a place to send the donations."
