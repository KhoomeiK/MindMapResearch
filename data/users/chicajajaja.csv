It’s my go-to though, and days when I’m a bit tired or off I put some on and it adds life to my face! Have fun playing with it! Your skin looks lovely."
makeupexchange,ffb37ms,t1_ffb2jho,1579750638.0,Thanks!

MUAontheCheap,ffavun2,t1_ffav33a,1579745679.0,"Thanks again! This is great— will def check out the boxes. Had only ever bought lipstick at stores (I love browsing), and hadn’t come across the minis until now."

MakeupAddiction,ffau6ak,t3_esjzrd,1579744571.0,"I really like this! I would say just a teeny bit of blush would make this even warmer, and something nude/light like Milk stick in werk on your lips to bring it all together (i find it really moisturizing and goes on easily, can even pop some on while I’m walking to work)."
MakeupAddiction,ffatlcx,t1_ffarr7v,1579744186.0,Was going to say exactly this! CUTE CUTE CUTE. I make the same “brave face”. I hope something amazing comes your way really soon.
MUAontheCheap,ffar77u,t3_es907e,1579742590.0,"Hi everyone! First time asking here— apologies in advance if I’m doing this wrong. I’m obsessed with small things of big things, and recently the tiny Bite Beauty lipsticks captured my heart. Thing is, only place I can find them is on makeupexchange, not anywhere else. Where do people get ds/mini lipsticks? Do brands like MAC also make them?"
makeupexchange,ffaqmw1,t1_ff936b6,1579742207.0,"Sorry was working all day! Thanks for getting back to me, I’ll pass for now. You’ve got a great inventory!"

makeupexchange,fdotvbu,t3_em0on7,1578612753.0,"Wow, your review is so excellent! I really appreciate you took the time to write it. I think I’ll take both! Do they come with any brushes?"

makeupexchange,fdlwde1,t3_elhxia,1578534091.0,Hi! How much would it be to ship the Milk Makeup mini lip+cheek to 10025? Thanks!
MakeupRehab,fdkdo7k,t3_elt919,1578501669.0,"Rather than going out and spending it just because it’s there, if I were you I’d draw up a list of things that I want or need (sometimes it’s difficult to tell the difference) and then sit with it for a while, say, for at least a month. By then, unless you really needed something and have gone out to get it, the urge to just spend/get might be gone and you can do a more moderate shop that won’t leave you feeling bad. I think it’s great to get yourself something you really want, but you can still take the time to consider whether you really want it at all."
makeupexchange,fdisgby,t3_ehdr8s,1578450023.0,I’ll take a chance on them :) thanks for letting me know.
AskLiteraryStudies,fdiq15t,t3_elknvk,1578448468.0,"Hi! I’m in a PhD program in English and Comparative Literature and I can relate to a lot of what you’re saying. First of all, if this is really what you want, then go for it. I had also taken a significant amount of time off and I think it’s served me well, I came into the program fired up and hungry for it. It sounds like you have a plan regarding your work situation, which is good, but I would be flexible to the possibility of that changing. That is, I’m not sure how much time your work studying (and maybe teaching) and your current work would take up, but there’s no rule to how you do this, and if you can balance both, then great. When I applied I already had an MA in literature, but wanted to change the field I had worked on for my MA thesis, so I wrote a completely new essay on a topic that reflected my current interests and used that as my writing sample. I don’t think any program expects you to have worked out your dissertation topic from the beginning. The way I understand it, they’re looking for potential, so this is something you can speak about in your “letter of intent” or personal essay if your program asks for it— find some way to show your scholarly interests and how they relate to future topics you’d like to work on, and mention how specific people in the department and resources at the institution (libraries, archives, museums in the area) can help you get there. About signing up for a course— it sounds like a great idea if you can find something you’re interested in (and it would also potentially get you a letter of recommendation from a person in academia). That’s all I have for now, but feel free to reach out with more questions. Hope my reply is at least a bit helpful. Good luck!"
makeupexchange,fdidpb8,t1_fdhtphi,1578440563.0,"That’s okay, sounds good! It’s the two little lipsticks in the picture, right? They’re so cute."
makeupexchange,fdhe5eu,t3_ehdr8s,1578420748.0,Hello! How much would you charge for both Bite Beauty mini lipsticks + 2 Ipsy bags to 10025? Thank you!

MakeupRehab,fddjf7l,t1_fddir4j,1578314661.0,"Yes, this is great advice. I think Sephora allows returns, even if the product is used. I’m not sure what their time limit is, but you could find out. You could also sell some things on makeup exchange (I’m sorry, don’t know how to link it here). It seems you’ve been collecting for a while, and it’s okay to not deal with it all in one day— adding them up has already been a task and a shock, I’d say take it one day at a time and eventually you’ll be seeing improvement. I hope you feel better soon. Good luck with everything!"
food,fdcjrpd,t3_eklmpp,1578276636.0,This is beautiful— I love the shape. Looks like something I’d happily break off with my hands and eat.

bookscirclejerk,fcltky1,t3_ehtet2,1577756138.0,"When I know someone is coming over I usually press play on my YouTube Beethoven (I keep a tab open at all times for this exact situation) and then place a single well-chosen book (open at random) anywhere I know they will walk past (often I just open the door with it in my hands), and that lets them know who’s boss. Oh and 1984 works every single time— I can just see it in their eyes that they think I’m clever, possibly intimidatingly so."
