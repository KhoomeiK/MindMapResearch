Something about that is just incredibly fitting and touching. 

Of course, I imagine Seiya will forget about her all over again, but such is the lot of deities who fall in love with mortals. I just wish I could know how she changes and how that next quest works out (though I don't want a second season, because that was a good ending right there)."

I think for the first time in an isekai, I'm not totally sure how this will turn out. This show hasn't really done any **POWER OF FRIENDSHIP!!** things I think, so it wouldn't surprise me if they didn't start now. 

On the other hand, if they don't, I'm not sure how this will play out. Mile actually might just be dead. At the start of the show it was explained that her power is the average of the weakest creature, and the strongest (an elder dragon, which they are now facing). This means, for probably the first time in an isekai, the MC is absurdly and hopelessly outmatched (and possibly dead). Add to that, everyone in Mile's party is significantly weaker than her.

This also isn't the show to allow any type of tragedy (aside from Reina's backstory), as we saw with that grandpa. So I wonder how they'll get out of this. I guess really there are only 3 options as I see them: 1) The Crimson Vow utilizes the power of friendship to defeat the dragon. 2) They fail and spend the last episode trying to escape with Mile and their lives. 3) Mile is now dead, but is brought to the same resurrection table as when she died on Earth, but this time she chooses not to be average so she can save her friends and comes back a veritable god."

The LoV offered him nothing, but as soon ass someone offers him unbridled power, the power to be the best, he'll take it. He might hesitate, initially refuse, but he'll take it. He doesn't want to *lose to Midoriya* far more than he doesn't want to *be a villain*. 

In truth, he may not even end up as a villain doing evil things, maybe he'll come around.

This leads meat-eaters, who are therefore expecting the vegetarian thing to taste like the meat thing (as exemplified by the language of *substitute vs. real thing*), to ultimately be disappointed. 

Not even necessarily because the vegetarian thing itself is bad, but because *it wasn't what they were expecting.* Because it attempts to be like meat, but ultimately falls short, it places itself into this uncanny valley of being just enough like meat, but just enough not like meat, that it ends up seeming very weird. 

If you ask someone to try a vegan steak they will almost certainly flinch and, even if they do try it, they will still have this idea of what a steak *should* taste in their minds. But if you ask the same person to try a ""vegan salad"" they'll probably be very confused because salads **are** vegan. No substitute, no comparison, no uncanny valley. Why? Because a salad does not claim to be a steak.

Everyone else must be a soulless husk (though I don't think I used quite those words). 

When I asked my parents about it with great concern, not knowing whether or not I had a soul, they informed me that of course I had a soul because I had forgotten to factor in all the animals and insects that died and were reborn. Naturally, everything living has a soul, which is reborn when it does. 

Later on (around 14 I think), I came to the conclusion that, if you are reborn with no memories of your previous life then, logically, you should not be able to exist at all to your knowledge. If you were in a pitch-black room and someone lit a candle, only to erase your memory of it completely once it was gone, then asked you at the very end how many candles you'd burned through, your response would be, *""what candles?""*

Thus, in order for you to perceive your own existence, or anything at all, you would have to not be *you*, the you that you see when you look in a mirror. Instead, you must be someone who has achieved enlightenment and is currently viewing and reliving their past lives. Or you would have to be someone who has already achieved enlightenment, but has chosen to remain inside the cycle of rebirth, thus allowing you to remember your own past and perceive your existence.

I just started DMing, having previously been a player for a couple years, and alignment is something that's suddenly become very relevant after I never cared about it before. Like I said, when I make a character, I don't usually consider what their alignment might be, I just go *""this is the character, this is what they believe in, this is how they act.""* At some point, someone will probably tell me what alignment I am, but I never bothered too much with it.

It's weird that now, when I DM, I notice one or two of my players have a huge obsession with alignment. They're always asking about it (e.g. *""what's his alignment? If it's evil, my Divine Sense would tell me that""*), or doing shit and going *""It's what my alignment would do!""* I guess they've done that before, I've just somehow never noticed it before. 

I'm with you, I'm not a fan of the alignment system. People don't fit into neat boxes, and trying to shove them into one only hurts RP I think, since you are now playing ""A CG Paladin"" instead of ""Drenn the Paladin.""

Animedubs,fdcfstn,t1_fdbh159,1578273830.0,"Season 2 is also great, but I think it's main problem is that it turned the attention away from Saitama. I can see their reasoning, a character that OP just winning everything 0 effort may have gotten pretty One Note Man eventually. Putting the focus on him entirely, using that for comedy, made a lot of sense in the first season when we still didn't fully grasp the outlandish power he possessed. For us the audience, discovering that power as he beat enemies, and watching people underestimate him (both monsters and heroes) was a lot of fun.

The problem is, now that we do know his power, the author runs the risk of the series turning into a bunch of different jokes that all somehow have the same One Punchline Man. So he's switched the focus instead to the wider world and thrown in the drama of the Monster Association and (mainly) Garo. While there's been some good fun in that, the problem is that the extra drama has come at the cost of the comedy. Saitama's completely bored and nonchalant attitude towards every fight, especially coupled with Genos who worshiped the ground he walked on and took **everything** way too seriously, was hilarious. 

By contrast, most of this season has featured more ""reasonable"" characters and lots of cool action. I personally think this season has been great from that perspective. The story has been pretty good, the drama is neat, the action is spectacular. But, like I said, a lot of that action and drama and (very importantly, as the first season lacked this) *plot*. It has abandoned the more Slice of Life format of the first season. 

The second season is, I think, very good in its own right and judged on its own. I'm enjoying it a lot. But it's *extremely* different from the first and that, I think, is what does it the most harm. If it were it's own show, or a spinoff, it would probably be a lot more well liked (not that it isn't now, but I definitely see more negative things about S2 than I did about S1). What people wanted, what people expected when this was announced was 12 more episodes of S1. That's not what they've gotten. I think that the primary, if not the sole problem with S2 of OPM is that it **is** **S2 of OPM**.

This is going to make for one hell of a development when they realise Overhaul can manufacture bullets that permanently destroy a quirk (unless they rescue Eri, but even then he can still do it 4 more times). 

I suppose this makes Deku the best candidate for One For All again, at least that's probably what story will lean into. I imagine we'll be seeing a bit more of Night Eye accepting Deku as Allmight's true successor in the next few episodes. That, or he'll push even harder to make Togata the successor, since I don't think that bullet erased the ability to **acquire** a quirk.

Finally, this was a quiet episode for the League of Villains. I'm excited to see what they're next move is, and I'd also like to know how they managed to say ""No"" when the Confession guy asked them if Shiguraki told them to betray Overhaul. I guess Shiguraki could have just actually not said anything?

Her dad is a jealous teddy bear, her mom is great, her sister is amazing, Lutz totally has the hots for her. 

I keep wondering how that romance will go, though, because Main was a teenager until like 2 months ago. Her current body might be that of a 5yo, but her mind is absolutely still teenage, and I can't imagine many teenagers being able to fall in love with a 5yo.

Otto is great, and Gunther's reactions when Main kept saying she loved him were fucking gold. Except for the part where he got all sulky and angry, but that only lasted about as long as it took her to say ""Daddy,"" so it's fine.

I'm still waiting for people to be appropriately impressed at the absolutely astonishing brilliance of what looks to them like a 5 year old uneducated commoner girl. She can read and write (which she learned extremely quickly), perform complex mathematics in her head, cook and make baskets super well with literally 0 prior experience (as far as they can tell), she straight up invented the crochet hook and therefore a new type of textile.

""*Flouring flourer Flower Flowers* **[addressee, whose job it is to flour things, and who is currently flouring something]**! *Flowering flour flower flourer* **[one who flours the flowers called flour flowers as they flower]** *Flour Flours* **[name of 3rd person]** *floured flowering flour flowers with floured flowered flour flower flour* [**the aforementioned flour flowers were floured with flour made from other flour flowers as they flowered, and that flour was itself made from flour flowers which were floured as they flowered]**. *Flower Flowers* **[expression of concern]**? *Flour Flours, flour flower flourer Flower Flowers* **[call for Flour Flours to flour the flour flower flourer named Flower Flowers]**!""

There is some cheating in here, I will admit. Like how *flourer* is not actually a word, though it does follow the standard English convention of verb+er (er meaning *""he who""*), also the act of using both Flour and Flower as names for people (though there is ample precedent for the use of a noun as a name), or the invention of a flower called a flour flower and the repeated use of its name throughout the paragraph.

Innkeeper's a dick and you joke that you wish they were dead? He'll leave the severed head on your pillow and hide behind the curtains, waiting happily to see your surprised and overjoyed face like a giant murderous house cat bringing you a dead mouse. He doesn't care what happens to him, so long as his friends are happy.
