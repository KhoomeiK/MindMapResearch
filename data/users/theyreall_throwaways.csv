AmItheAsshole,fdpekxk,t1_fdo3bvs,1578626624.0,"NTA. Wanted to let you know that in this sub you should only upvote the post if the person is an asshole. So, I won't upvote your post bc you are clearly not the asshole. I didn't know this at first and still have to catch myself from upvoting. Best of luck with everything"
cancer,fdkak0m,t1_fdk8gf7,1578499782.0,"It's a brand/ certain type of radiation treatment. It's considered a more accurate radiation treatment, to within a few millimeters of a tumors edge. (it's on a huge computer controlled arm) Accuracy is always important for the least amount of damage to healthy tissue, but can be esp important for certain areas like brain."
cancer,fdjyfeu,t3_elrblb,1578491374.0,"Well, cancer sucks and I'm sorry you are all having to deal with it. Stats are very scary, but always remember that they are just averages and every person is so very different.  My Mom is about  6 yrs out from this diagnosis.

Mom had stage 3 breast cancer, it progressed to stage 4 and has came back a few different times. She had brain cancer twice. First time ~6 yrs ago she had surgery and chemo, and it seemed to clear. Came back in a different area, that time she had cyberknife and chemo. No cancer signs or treatment for about 4.5 yrs after that. No real lasting problems from the surgery or radiation. 

Cancer recently presented itself again, but she has finished chemo (is still on an immune checkpoint inhibitor) and scans are coming back clear. 

I know she had been very lucky (as lucky as you can be for having cancer) and has always responded very well to treatment. Not everyone is so lucky. 

Try to keep in mind that there is usually some lag in updated survival rates. Treatments progress so quickly that it takes time for revised rates to catch up. Childhood cancer (overall) is an example of this. It's gone from a 10% survival rate to 80+% in the last 40 yrs or so.  There are so many new treatments and drugs in the last 8-10 yrs just for my mom's specific cancer, it's amazing.

as another user said, terminal doesn't have to mean dying within the next few months. I actually watched a vice special on cancer a few yrs ago and there was a woman on there that had been living with terminal cancer for almost 20 yrs. We just never really know how each patient will respond to treatment. 

Best of luck to you and your family."

Brochet,fd9hbhn,t1_fd8c8hm,1578233365.0,That's awesome to hear. I hope to hear about all the cool stuff your son and nephew (and you) come up with!
Brochet,fd6nj42,t3_ek4pac,1578193469.0,"I just wanted to say this is really awesome. Its great that you shared this with him, novice or not. I'm interested in what he wants to make. At first it's just exciting that you created something, a piece of fabric from a single string. But then you start imagining scarves, hats, toys, etc.  Hope you both have lots of fun with the new hobby."

crochet,fcu1m3m,t1_fctwip8,1577969529.0,A soap saver is basically a bag to put bar soap into (they were orig made out of Terry cloth washcloths).  You wet the bag with the soap inside and wash that way. You're less likely to drop the soap and it allows you to use up every sliver of bar soaps. I'm assuming her soap saver is the bag in the front with the white tie string. Hope that makes sense.

Edit: duh, Google is a thing. Google said irritating :-)

It's also one of the few words in another language that i was close on the pronunciation. Also, the Google translate voice seemed bored/annoyed that she had to say it aloud."
aww,fcnu268,t1_fcmyknn,1577818416.0,"They actually say straw is the best for stray cats. Straw (not hay) won't attract pests, doesn't mold easily and dries quickly. Towels/ blankets aren't good if you are somewhere wet and cold. Once the fabric gets wet it can actually make the cats colder. Depending on your climate this may not be an issue. (Read too much about this when befriending a stray pregnant cat). That being said, it's awesome what you're doing. That cat looks very appreciative, good job"

Indoors at about 75 degrees i sleep with one on my back (they have a sleeve and elastic straps) and 8 hrs later they are still cold. Not ice cold, but much colder than cold tap water in the summer. They don't sweat and come in a variety of sizes. Good luck."
