* Wow, TV news. That's new. Well, I'm just gonna say I haven't watched Pucard. Because STD was dogshite, and CBS seem to be greenlighting fifty dofferent Star Trek thing. So, I have been extremely hesitant towards Picard, I'm scared it will ruin Jean-Luc Picard, and Star Trek as a whole... well, STD already did that, but still. Also, I think Dan just admitted that Star Trek Enterprise wasn't that bad. 

* Avenue 5 is on my to-do list. I got halfway through episode one, but then I had to leave.

* Never seen Good Place.

* Okay, vidya game news. A low graphic city builder sounds nifty to poor fuckers, who cannot take high res sidewalk textures. 

* The 2020 Sonic Initiative sounds weird, but hey, if we get another fangame turned into a real game, I'm game. SEGA, go buy Sonic Utopia, and let them do whatever, fans love making sonic games. 

* Also, the Sonic movie has a sponsorship. You know how Sonic loves Chilidogs? Did you know there is a restaurant called Sonic? They sell chillidogs. And the movie was sponsored by an unrelated Taco place. I won't even watch the film, I refuse to support an Anti-Vaxxer like Jim Carrey.

* Remaking obscure games is a weird flex, but ok. Also, bring back Headz.

* S L E E V E

* And now for shit that wasn't in this week. EA are rumoured to be making a Knights of the Old Republic remake. This is groovy, because I wanted to play it. But scary, since they may edit it to fit within Disney Canon. No kickass violence, streamlined story, Revan is a puppy, and 40,000 years worth of lore. They might neuter it into the next Mass Effect.

* Mass Effect might be getting remastered. Be dissapointed with the end of the trilogy all over again. And blue alien asses. 

* Dying Light 2 has been delayed... indefinitely... I feel bad for those fans. Now you can join the Dead Island 2 fans.

* All classic Half-Life games are now free for a limited time. If you haven't played Half-Life yet, go play it. Opposing Force is great, and one of the few Gearbox games I like. 

* Stardew Valley has sold 10 Million copies. Not bad for basically a single developer. Thanks for everything ConcernedApe!
