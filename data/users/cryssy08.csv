AskReddit,fg87bp5,t3_exagml,1580611441.0,"I wish I would've tried out for sports. I really liked volleyball and softball but was too nervous to try out for some stupid reason or another. I remember thinking I didn't want to try out for volleyball because the girls' shorts were way too short for my taste and I didn't try out for softball because I felt like only the preppy girls made the team. Ugh, high school."

Advice,ffs3g2o,t3_euth98,1580172183.0,"I don't know if this will work or not, but I have very moody teenage girls and usually when they get in their depressed moods, I try to find an activity that they like and suggest we do it. Once I get them into an activity, they tend to get distracted from their minds for a bit and loosen up. I then try to start casual conversation with them, which sometimes turns into deeper conversations about what's really bothering them. By the end of the activity they seem to be in a better mood. I can't really say it's a cure-all, but it helps. For example, one of my daughters likes shopping so we'll go to the store. The other daughter likes crafts and creative things, so we'll do that. Sometimes they just need distraction and to talk."

Lyrics: 
We chase misprinted lies
We face the path of time
And yet I fight
And yet I fight
This battle all alone
No one to cry to
No place to call home

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

My gift of self is raped
My privacy is raked
And yet I find
And yet I find
Repeating in my head
If I can't be my own
I'd feel better dead"

Advice,fe2lg4p,t3_enjhwg,1578839943.0,"Maybe it's because you have been so emotionally abused that any time someone starts yelling, you fear what is coming next. Appropriate response I would say. Also, I grew up in a similar household and still have anxiety caused by yelling and really loud noises. I would suggest some counseling if you can get some. Take care."
