Or star wars been more impactful if the catch phrase was ""may the mother effing force be with you""? Some of the absolute greatest movies of all time had little to no profanity. Usually when it gets heavy it just gets distracting and feels forget to me."

aww,fgeovpx,t1_fge9m8w,1580705169.0,I had three 5-8 year olds watch that movie a couple years ago... They didn't flinch at Little foots mom dying... Then when he saw his shadow and thought it was her they straight up laughed... I think I know 3 very young serial killers in the making...

instant_regret,fg6falc,t1_fg6amcm,1580566301.0,What makes it even better is assuming no one saw this happen he had to have thought it was so funny that he told them about it and suggested they go back and look at the video. Haha
