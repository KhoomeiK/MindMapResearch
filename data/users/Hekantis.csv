todayilearned,ff3sg02,t1_ff2oab7,1579547859.0,Gilead is the name of the dystopian country from The Handmaids Tale by Margaret Attwood. Why in the world would you name your company after that? Its like they are proud of being the bad guys.
todayilearned,ff2ngwj,t1_ff2i067,1579514823.0,Wait wait wait a sec. Hol'up. There is a pharma corp called Gilead?
tifu,femcgok,t1_fejz2dm,1579248510.0,"Dude, I was tasked doing this for a short spell in my late teens. The IT guy/gal has seen it all before and generally do not care beyond making sure that the laptop they're working on cant be seen flashing 'deep anal bbc with horny stepsis' as a file title to other costumers.

Edit: though it never happened to me, any serious indication of child porn would go straight to the police but since we did not personally opened every file after recovery we might have missed it too if it had a normal enough title."

books,fej5zeo,t1_fej3noz,1579158269.0,"Ok, pitch it to me. Why just this one?"
books,fej5wn2,t1_fej0lif,1579158178.0,"Why though? Assuming the same text is read, in the same font, without any further distractions present, the medium you read it on should not affect the social aspect you experience from the story. I mean, I get that some might get a light headache or eyestrain by reading from a backlid screan but e-readers dont have that problem. I personally read nearly exclusively from backlit screens but switching to print does not diminish my enjoyment of the story. 

You could see a text like a cheese cake. You can serve it on a nice, antique plate with a silver fork or on a paper plate with a plastic fork or on a rustic slab of stone with a wooden spoon, its not going to change the nutritional content of the cheesecake."
todayilearned,fej3o36,t1_feio7nm,1579155693.0,That abd I guess learning some make-up skills and get a good looking wig for the photo op. Then change your name and location right after. I wonder how and what they use in europe now gdpr is getting taken seriously
privacy,feh5w2g,t1_feh1lwx,1579109795.0,Holland already has those for a while. I had to be fingerprinted at the condulate the last time I updated my passport. Took ages because I have zombie fingers.

menwritingwomen,fdgnunc,t1_fdfnbnh,1578403483.0,Uh... no? And certainly not while looking good. Not even YouTubes best beauty gurus can do mascara without making a gawpy fishface and they are experts in doing makeup prittely
menwritingwomen,fdgn9or,t1_fdftey4,1578402973.0,"That is to assume you are the property tycoon, of course."
menwritingwomen,fdgltzo,t1_fdfk7oj,1578401660.0,"It is still the author that decides to put it in there in the first place. The rest can be decided from the rest of the text. Does this women end up with agency of her own or is she limited by the text (not even the protagonist per se, just the rest of the story) to be a sex object? What about the other women in the story? What about the women in his other books?"
menwritingwomen,fdgliby,t1_fdfsqwb,1578401352.0,Yes and no. A characters point of view and an authors one do not need to be the same but there is overlap. Differentiating between the two can be hard because there is often more than enough to support the sexist views in the work but a whole lot less clear cut evidence to support its source. Author or character. You usually end up with having to read the rest of his work to get anywhere.
todayilearned,fcws5xh,t1_fcwq4ty,1578035439.0,"Everyone does that. Everyone sees things that others miss and at the same time miss a lot themselves. You're not allone in that. But because we all muse about different things its sometimes hard to listen to other peoples musings. They just aren't always interesting to them. Also, a lot depends on how willing someone is to have that conversation. Often its a lot like listening to someone else accounting their dreams. 

Don't put other people below you because you are tempted to think they aren't the same as you. The experience you're describing is not unique. 

On talent. Well, a talent is basically nothing more than opportunity combined with motivation. If you think that you might be really good at something all you have to do is go do it. Opportunity can be created and motivation is in your own hands. Go do it!"
KneadyCats,fcwqnwj,t1_fcuxvqv,1578033823.0,"At 4 weeks she should still be getting milk. Poor thing is probably hungry but unsure about what to do with with solids yet. Make sure to weight her often to make sure she is gaining like it should. Sometimes it can't be helped to adopt them out at such a young age. I mean, there is a reason why the legal adoption age is at 12 weeks (in Sweden that is)."
KneadyCats,fcujtdq,t1_fcu5jqo,1577982625.0,Its not too uncommen behaviour for cats that have been weened too early and those just being weened and dont quite get solids yet.

todayilearned,fc2dq53,t1_fc1aikg,1577354221.0,As it should be everywhere else too.
todayilearned,fc188ky,t1_fc17l95,1577311057.0,"I am lucky that mine are seldom longer than 16 but often there is only 8 hours between each shift. Calculate travel time from and to work, food, a shower and a change of clothes I often don't get more than 5 hours actual sleep. If I'm lucky. This is fine for a day or two but 5 days in a row and I start making dumber and dumber mistakes. I'd not trust me in traffic after that but its also the only way home."
