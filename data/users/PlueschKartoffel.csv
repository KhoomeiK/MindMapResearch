I honestly don't understand it.

The amount of men saying ""She's hot, though. Can't blame the boy."" or ""I wish she was my teacher when I was 13"" is absurd.
Exactly, ""can't blame the boy"" because it's the TEACHER/ADULT who's to blame, which apparently doesn't happen in the brain of many men."

Which is OBVIOUSLY wrong."
unpopularopinion,ff5runo,t3_eroexl,1579607820.0,"Well, according to the comment section this is quite the controversial topic.
At first I thought ""Not unpopular, just common sense"", but to I can also understand some of the comments against your post.

One of your sentence that threw me off was: ""Racism isn't a big deal anymore""
If anything, it was never gone and is becoming a bigger deal again nowadays. 
""Cassual"" racism is also still a big thing. Even in my work place. We have a couple of foreign cleaning ladies, they're doing a good job in my opinion. I'm always polite and I thank them for their work when they're done with my office.
But many people here don't. Simply based on their skin tone and their strong accent, most people here assume that these ladies are doing a poor job or even that they would steal anything from the desks when given the oppurtunity. Only based on their ethnicity. Not because they can actually prove that these ladies are doing a poor job (which they don't). It's just an assumption and thus apparently for them a reason for them to not even greet them or to be rude even. Or deeper skinned full time employees that are new here. ""Oh and btw have you seen the new colleague? You know that negro looking, black man. He's got such a weird name as well. How am I supposed to pronounce that?! If he speaks french, then why isn't his name at least somewhat european?! Also, I've heard that he's not even working properly and that he's on his phone all the time... But anything for the quota I guess."" 
Which were literally the things people tried to gossip with me about, but never based on actual ""proof"". They've never seem him on his phone themselves (which is stupid nevertheless, because we ALL are on our phones from time to time during work), they weren't even in the same team to comment on his performance.
It was all just rumors spread by I don't even want to know who, based on a strong french accent, a not-typically-european name and his skin tone. 

Not to mention the very apparent and seemingly uprising racism. Fascist or right-winged parties are gaining more and more approval in some countries, which shows in many election statistics. In some interviews people even openly say racist things about the current refugee situation or about deeper skinned foreigners in general. 
Of course people don't have to accept everything that happens around them, but to be racist again people that are in need for a safe place because their own country is literally in pieces, is beyond my understanding."

unpopularopinion,fddp9u3,t3_ekm2ze,1578320254.0,"I've learned that communication is crucial.
If you don't/can't talk about the things you'd like to try out then it's probably a good thing to reconsider the relationship.
Of course people can have their difficulties in expressing what they want/need and I've also had more than enough bad experiences with men that completely disregarded my desires or tried to do things with me that I said I didn't want to do multiple times, which led to me feeling uncomfortable with the topic in general and thus not wanting to talk about it. I reconsidered my relationships and if I wanted to stay with someone that disregards such an important factor in a relationship. 

There are people out there that are willing to make an effort. My husband was extremely patient with me in the beginning of the relationship because I told him about my bad experiences.
Nowadays we can just talk freely about anything. What we like, what we maybe didn't like that much, things we want to try out in bed. Our sexlife has improved so incredibly much just by talking to each other without building up pressure to do certain things.
If you can't do that, if your partner (regardless of gender) flips out or makes a scene just because you adressed your guys current sex life, I honestly suggest reconsidering the relationship."
unpopularopinion,fddgr0u,t1_fddfrr7,1578311565.0,"Thank you! Couldn't have put it better.
Communication is crucial for a good sex life but if none of the involved parties actually voice their needs/desires - of course it's going to be not that good.

I've had my fair share of problems talking about sex with my now husband. Not because of him, but in previous relationships sex was really only focused on the man. I needed stimulation in order to get wet or generally in the mood, they were annoyed and all like ""Can't we just use lube and stick it in?!"" or when I said that I didn't want to do anal, because I was afraid of it, most of the dudes just tried to ""sneakily"" force their weiner in without lube regardless and were surprised that I got mad at them for it.

Luckily it's all different now and we both talk very freely about what we like or things we want to try out. There is no pressure to do certain things, no weird expectations. It makes the entire experience much more carefree."
