The state requires the kids be there less than 10 hours. she's usually there 8.5 for us. There are places I could take her that would give me a discount of like 10% but they're only so much more convenient and would require a big shift for my daughter. And again that is assuming there are openings which usually there are not. I recently was told 6 to 9 months until an opening if we were waitlisted. Or we could try and get in part time and hope for a sooner opening. Most places dont do part time so that doesnt work.

In general it's expensive to live here. Rent for 500 sq.ft. studios is around 2k (or much higher for some luxury buildings). The daycare workers have to live somewhere. It's also fairly competitive, lots of population growth lately has a compounding effect. Not to mention everyone wants their kids to go to a ""good"" daycare (whatever that means) so every place tries to sell the same simple educational benefits. For example, second language training starting at like 2 or 3). The food is all prepped on site and they have doctor/nutritionist planned meals.

There are also ways of saving some pretax dollars for daycare which we do, but yeah compared to the cost it's peanuts.

What is amusing to me is that most of these chains really push that they teach spanish (lots of these daycares are basically franchises of large daycare chains). However my area is much more than half asian and indian. Many of the parents would pay a premium to have this second language be either mandarin or a language from india (sorry I'm not as familiar with these languages). Yet the daycare providers are almost entirely from the U.S. and have the experience that spanish is a good second language. They're always confused when my wife (who is chinese) asks about chinese language offerings. They seem to think it's a niche request when they just finished telling us that like half of the kids are asian and speak chinese at home."
personalfinance,fdqoxdo,t1_fdqkbcv,1578671718.0,"Extreme example, my wife and I live in an hcol area and pay a bit over 2600 a month for one toddler (with annual increases it's basically what we paid as an infant). More than we paid in rent a couple years ago, but way less than our mortgage. 

My sister, who lives in our home town of ~5k ppl, was complaining to me the other day that costs went up at her daycare to more than 130 a week or something for two kids. Now, granted her kids are school age now so they only go afternoons. But, I know when they were both going full time she paid 400 a few years ago.

There are cheaper places here (closer to 2k with discounts from work), this one is across the street from my wife's old job. Our daughter likes it so we didnt want to transition her when the other places we looked at when my wife switched jobs weren't quite as nice and were almost the same drive anyway."
politics,fcxzf24,t1_fcwniaq,1578072575.0,"Not to mention all of that expensive fracking starts to look better with more expensive oil, so u.s. production actually increases quite a bit. Since there are restrictions on exporting oil from the u.s. stays a little more stable, because we have a lot of fracking potential. Meanwhile worldwide oil gets more expensive and other countries start warring for oil."
todayilearned,fcmgo7r,t1_fcmgls2,1577774560.0,Agreed. Easily my favorite podcast.
todayilearned,fcmao6u,t1_fcm9tav,1577768868.0,"The podcast is called Faculty of Horror and it's excellent. Looking at it, it wasnt a recent episode it's from 2013, I only discovered this podcast in the last year and plowed through it. I think what I was thinking of is that they recently started doing additional content for patreon subscribers and one of the things they did was a commentary track for Candyman.

The episode itself is episode 8, they talk about candyman and urban legend."
todayilearned,fcm9a5g,t1_fcm3cv9,1577767697.0,I recently rewatched it after a podcast I like did an episode about it. It really holds up. It is very good and you get a lot more out of it as an adult.
personalfinance,fcbi332,t1_fc951la,1577587133.0,I started one with 2500 a year-ish ago in WA state
compsci,fbijrn1,t1_fbi2yq6,1576903120.0,Is fracking kind of like taking a survey? What's the analogy here XD
