EatCheapAndHealthy,fgn1hfl,t1_fgn1aad,1580935881.0,Probably the same thing. Also eating sugar I've heard makes your stomach expand.. So leaving room for dessert is a thing. Also might explain why sugary sodas are forced down our gullet our whole lives.

Also putting a teaspoon of baking soda in the water with the potatoes will help with a crisper potato. You can also bake them for a longer time in the oven if you want them super crispy. One YouTuber I watch did them at 450 for 45 minutes then rearranged/flipped them and did it for another 45. And coated them in olive oil Ahead of time to impart crispier skin too but not sure how healthy that last part is."

confession,fgm6on3,t3_ezaeq3,1580918973.0,I'm 30 and I've had sex with 60 women in 12 years. I'm ashamed though and don't tell women cause it looks bad. It's just when I'm single I tend to play the field until I find what I want in a relationship-aspect. Or people can't stand me for more than sex.

BrandNewSentence,fglyevl,t1_fglxonf,1580913974.0,I didn't even say they were private cause even the state/publicly/government ones are for profit. It's literal slave labor cause it's been a law since the times of slavery. The minimum wage for slave labor hasn't gone up since they first enacted it iirc.
BrandNewSentence,fglwsch,t1_fglq8gm,1580912836.0,"Once you get in trouble for something petty it basically can become a snowball effect where you're basically institutionalized. And that's how they like it. Most prisons are for-profit in the US, if not all of them, so it's advantageous for them to keep you stuck in a perpetual loop of going in and out of prison.

Also say you do get in prison but get out and are mandated to probation and drug court.. How is someone with a felony supposed to pay for drug court and probation if they're much harder to be employed? And even if they find a job, odds are it won't be one that's high paying. Yeah maybe they can get those charges expunged from their record if they complete the drug court and the probation but good luck being able to support yourself and do that."
