Otherwise, the longest I’ve ever listened to them was like 45 minutes to an hour. At which point I need to usually do something else that requires all my attention.


However I realize this isn’t the case for everyone - and some people may need longer battery life. Which is okay. These people can just get other wireless headphones that work for them."

Unless of course they’re saying that the random “n” sample size is reddit - and since there’s soooo many people on here that there’s bound to be close usernames.


But then at that point it doesn’t seem like it’s part of this paradox. Just some other statistic.
