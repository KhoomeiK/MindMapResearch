gis,fffa755,t3_etaqng,1579879473.0,"I wish there was more info on how this was calculated. Are these global numbers? Is it based on downloads, licenses, or surveys of users? I don't really see a way that you get get this over over the years reliably, but the end seems like it might be about right. I would have thought ArcGIS would be an even higher percentage."
WearOS,ffaytzk,t1_ffaiuk6,1579747654.0,I use Google Pay with it all the time.  That's one of my favorite features that my previous watch didn't have .
WearOS,ffaymdk,t1_ffavvxu,1579747513.0,I'm thinking about deleting it. I do like some of the metrics it has better then Google Fit.
WearOS,ffao5rg,t3_esh5vl,1579740544.0,"I got a Gen 5 a couple of weeks ago. I really like. As far as battery goes, I did have to change the frequency that the Cardiogram app takes heart rates. I think the default was 5 minutes and the battery was almost dead by bedtime. I changed it to hourly and now I have about 40% left at bed time That's with AOD on, WiFi on, and tilt to wake off.  I see people turn off WiFi, but I think that is necessary I tend to walk around the house and office with my phone on the desk or dresser so I think WiFi is necessary to get notifications from a longer distance."
WearOS,ffanpw1,t1_ffa9oz3,1579740246.0,I was about to give up and move to Apple until I got a Gen 5. I'm happy again for now ..
Moto_Z,ff24eit,t1_fdrm6oe,1579493499.0,"I thought about it, but you can get a Pixel 3 on Swappa for the same price as a Z4. I just can't support Motorola any longer. I'm so disappointed in the availability of mods and backs for the 3 and 4 generations.  I've had Moto phones for over a decade, but it seems like innovation went away after Google sold Motorola to Lenovo."
WearOS,fen8qc7,t1_fen7jv9,1579279426.0,I could have got another 4gen.
WearOS,femx4ej,t1_femtix2,1579271896.0,"No, but I did just go to the Fossil store last week to exchange my Gen 4 when the back fell off. Make sure you keep your receipt and original band  to get a new one. I actually ended up getting credit for the Gen 4 and applied that to a Gen 5."
WearOS,fely3ej,t3_eppcba,1579233875.0,"The good news is that it's a 2 year warrantee, and it restarts when they repair or replace the watch. There is no way  the replacement will last 2 years so you can just keep replacing it until they come out with a generation that fixes it. I  just upgraded to a 5 gen because they didn't have my exact same model of 4 gen. I did have to pay the difference."
WearOS,felxwgj,t1_felmkdq,1579233726.0,I miss that charger. I hate these stupid flat chargers they have now.
WearOS,felxd5k,t3_epsvb1,1579233325.0,"I really liked my Moto 360 gen 2, but even when new it seemed like it barely made it a day with AOD. Eventually the battery died and could barely make it 8 hours so I stopped wearing it. I just got a Fossil Gen 5 and I am very happy with it. Reminds me of when I first got my Moto360. To bad the bands don't fit."
baylor,feliz4x,t1_felf00c,1579223310.0,"I agree. I thought the VT guy would be a step down. This is a step up. Rhule was great, but it was apparent during the bowl games that there was still a lot of work to do to get to the level of LSU or even Georgia. It's hard to do that without too recruits. Hopefully this hire will take us to that next level."
baylor,fel0rsl,t3_eppvk9,1579211595.0,"I really like this hire. He's got the National Title experience, and can continue to build on the strength of Baylor's defense. Hopefully he has the ability to recruit top talent  I think he's the right fit to take Baylor to the next level."
