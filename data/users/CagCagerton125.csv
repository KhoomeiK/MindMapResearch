Eldenring,feooiqq,t3_eq6gfv,1579303084.0,I'm going to be honest I look at this subreddit all the time and I am certain we are no longer sane. Haha.
ShouldIbuythisgame,fenkwdj,t3_eq4ami,1579286875.0,My recommendation would probably go to Doom 2016. Its an excellent level based shooter with a fun story. Not a lot of acting from our main character though. You would also be getting caught up just in time for Doom Eternal in March if you find you enjoy the game.
ShouldIbuythisgame,fenkh84,t3_eq3348,1579286621.0,"All of these suggestions are great! Darkest Dungeon is an extremely deep and challenging game with tons of customization options. It's also great on switch. Character death is permanent, so you will very much have to think about continuing on if a dungeon is getting the better of you. 

If you want tough choices that can have major story implications I highly recommend the Banner Saga. If you have Microsoft PC game pass I know Banner Saga 1 and Banner Saga 2 are on there. 

There are a few other turn based games that come to mind to me as well. Most the dungeon crawler rougelike games like Tales of Maj'Eyal come to mind as well as less combat focused games like Wayward (this is a survival rougelike with turn based movement. Try to survive on an island. You will die a lot, but its great fun.) If you like Into the Breach I would also highly recommend FTL. It isn't turn based as such, but definitely presents you with a plethora of tough choices."
Malazan,fels4qh,t1_felkayx,1579229582.0,I think this and honestly the other comments in this thread are spot on. it seems anyone with enough aptitude can create one. Makes me wonder what someone like Quick Ben  could do if he was loyal to one Warren. That being said the series seems to show that loyalty to a single Warren almost enforces weakness. That being said Tayschren and Banaschar are hard to explain. Most of the destriants actually.

ShouldIbuythisgame,feibr0b,t3_ep6716,1579134793.0,"*I see more than a few survival games in there. I loved Ark, Rust, Seven Days to Die etc... Have you tried any of the lifestyle sims like Stardew Valley or My Time at Portia? As a fan of the competitive survival games like those I find that these scratch a similar itch. Its basically the gathering, base design, and survival elements without worrying about dying every 5 minutes.*"
Warhammer40k,feiasgw,t1_fegkfdh,1579134149.0,I wish he'd snap me in half...
Malazan,febx7ad,t1_febqdb5,1578963772.0,Please! I need this as a shirt. Haha.
Malazan,fe8vl55,t1_fe8v1l5,1578931523.0,100% this. There is a reason Shadowthrone avoids this one. haha.
ShouldIbuythisgame,fe8vg02,t1_fe8n7z6,1578931467.0,"If you like MH games. Monster Hunter World is amazing. 100+ hours of content is a very conservative estimate, especially with Iceborne out. The community is incredibly patient and helpful, and it is just a wonderful world to immerse yourself in."
Malazan,fdsyw1t,t1_fdspj5s,1578709743.0,"Deadhouse Gates and memories of Ice are the books that stuck with me the most after finishing all of the main series and all the extras. That being said there is a lot to be gained in this order. I would still recommend the main series followed by everything else, but the extras are great."
Malazan,fdlsh8j,t1_fdllch5,1578531430.0,"Kallor won me back over to be honest. For several reasons. Just wait.

Edit: https://youtu.be/y64KTlk6N_s this song kinda says it all without having any spoilers."
Malazan,fdkwn6b,t1_fdkwhpq,1578512685.0,"That's true. I really loved Lister's Dujek, but not so much Page's. The opposite for Kalam and in the long run Quick Ben as well."
Malazan,fdku9ae,t3_elv344,1578511275.0,"There are definitely a few bootleg versions. If you are audible or have physical copies it should be Page. I like Page, but I missed Lister a lot."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fdi0s7a,t3_elhpy8,1578433695.0,"I believe I am at about halfway through the game. I think it depends on how you feel about slower paced games. I really enjoy the game play loop it provides, but there isn't a lot of game play unless you really dig in to find it. 

To me it feels less like a game, and more like a conversation with Hideo Kojima. It's almost like he is sitting in front of you telling you his thoughts about the world, then every once in awhile he plays you a song he likes. Its a lot of fun, but is not game like in the traditional sense. If you like Hideo Kojima's world building in prior games you will probably enjoy it though."
IAmA,fd6tnez,t1_fd6t9gk,1578195562.0,Love your outlook. Your app definitely seems to have long term relvence.
IAmA,fd6si2k,t3_ejz5l4,1578195166.0,"I hope this question isn't a bummer, but how do you see yourself and your app staying relevant in the long run? I learned some coding during my biology masters, but have always been afraid to try and use it due to the above fears."
aww,fd6s28l,t1_fd6s090,1578195014.0,Might be a little high pitched for him.
aww,fd6s090,t1_fd6rqyv,1578194996.0,"I am certain that there are times when that is the case, but our guy was taken to the shelter very young and treated with nothing but love by the shelter workers. He is a sweetheart and clearly trusts humans. The only downside is he doesn't seem to like the audio from Your Lie In April. Haha."
aww,fd6pkhf,t1_fd6mqyt,1578194166.0,"We adopted him from Central Texas Spca in Leander Texas and I cannot recommend it enough. He was treated with nothing not love while he was there and the trust he feels from humans is clear now that he is home with what are essentially two strangers.

Edit: Spelling"
AskReddit,fd4zspi,t3_ejwdpo,1578172772.0,When I was a child no one could convince me it wasn't called a Buick Reg-All.

Eldenring,fcyxtrr,t3_ejkrjs,1578089455.0,That's clearly a Moltress.
ShouldIbuythisgame,fcxi1rp,t3_ejgdi7,1578063448.0,"Not sure about action games in Rome, but Assassin's Creed Odyssey is exactly what you are looking for with Greece. It's great too. A little grindy at times, but only slightly so imo."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fcwnzae,t3_ej5jq4,1578031157.0,"I think that's a good choice. I would definitely read a quick synopsis of the first one before I started, but it's not necessary to play the game."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fcvzy2d,t3_ej5jq4,1578013948.0,"There are tons of these. If you like Uncharted you can't go wrong with the Tomb Raider reboots, and Jedi Fallen Order has some similar mechanics. If you want a big rpg or something my recommendation would be Divinity Original Sin 2."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fcvg2h4,t1_fcvehbn,1578001346.0,This too. I am not sure how that works on other consoles though.
ShouldIbuythisgame,fcve0fk,t1_fcva6gv,1578000127.0,"That is because Bethesda set a system within those games that allows a small number of approved mods to be downloaded onto the PS4 or Xbox versions. It's a very small number of mods compared to what is available on PC, and I believe that all of them have to go through some kind of approval process before being made available on console."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fcv9od4,t3_ej38b5,1577997552.0,"The Forest is really good, but it is infinitely better with friends.

Edit: Did not notice that you were on PS4. One of the things that makes Mount and Blade amazing is the number of great mods for it. I would recommend The Forest for sure if you are on PS4."
Malazan,fcv45r4,t3_eiqrv8,1577994274.0,Thanks! That looks excellent! Very nice work. Now you just need Cotillion and Sorry to go along with it.
ShouldIbuythisgame,fctg39w,t3_eisnhv,1577942140.0,"While I love Fallen Order RDR2 is one of the best stories ever told in gaming. That being said if you are looking for a great gameplay experience to back it up I don't believe RDR2 has it. It's very much an on rails experience where you go one place and shoot a little, see some story, and then do it again. Fallen order has better gameplay from moment to moment, but does fall short of RDR2 with story."

Malazan,fcsyrsi,t1_fcoh03a,1577928490.0,"This comment hasn't gotten enough attention. The sorrow Dassem felt as this was playing out destroyed me. His role as the Lord of Tragedy hurt me so bad here. He knew he was removing one of the greatest forces for good on the world and had no choice in the matter. It's not super explored in the works, but I know Anomander was heartbroken to have to use him like he did. It's so powerful to see a character die and know they felt so horrible for the person who ended there life."

He is master of misleading (but real) kindness, and I love him."

ShouldIbuythisgame,fcl70ry,t3_ehjh98,1577741182.0,"Huge fan of this game. I have only played through it once, but it is of decent length, and really encourages multiple playthroughs. The post above that compared it to Lucas Arts titles is correct, but it is less difficult than those I believe."

Quaint cozy little town that always seems to have some kind of event going on. Stayed here for 3 days and never got bored at all. I mean you can sit on a hotel balcony and just look at mountains for hours and not get bored. Plus the locals are incredibly friendly.
