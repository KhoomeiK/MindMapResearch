nostalgia,ffhimmw,t3_etgyd2,1579936935.0, But most importantly what outfits did u have for him?! Lol I had the adorable winter parka one and a summer one with sandals. I think the outfits came with the appropriate book and cassette.
DerryGirls,ffge6xe,t3_ethhdn,1579904245.0,I love the show as well. My husband enjoys it too. I love how the last episode of season 2 played out. And yes the wedding was golden as was the wake!

nostalgia,ffdhsb1,t1_ffdgyvq,1579821147.0,It took me forever to find this type of sticker book. I kept getting results for the modern actual sticker ones. But yea I had this one too!
nostalgia,ffdc64g,t1_ffd1yim,1579817755.0,Yea! There were quite a few that didn’t smell like anything it was meant to represent and you would keep smelling it and come up with your own name for it.
nostalgia,ffdbwwf,t3_esy6bs,1579817590.0,My high school also had a few that pre cell phone I had to use too.
AskMen,ffck67b,t1_ffc5g4v,1579801193.0,Same. We aren’t ring people so why waste money on something we didn’t want.
AskMen,ffcjwft,t1_ffbwscg,1579801029.0,Same here! Neither of us are ring people so we def didn’t need to waste money on that.  Think in the beginning people used to ask how come we don’t wear rings but pretty much all the family and friends know by now so we may only get questions from strangers but very rarely. So many people do their own thing nowadays with weddings that people are getting used to changes I think.
maui,ffa4b5k,t3_eshkzs,1579727608.0,I think it might have to do with Hawaii being an island. People will say I’m in Chicago or I’m in Oregon but it makes no sense saying I’m on Chicago or I’m on Oregon whereas you can say both with Hawaii or Maui or other islands. You can be on an island bc you have to fly or boat to one so idk it kinda makes sense? People are just used to saying In instead of On for places so that would be my explanation. Unless you are talking of locals using it differently than idk.
CozyPlaces,ff7xjwc,t3_es5d61,1579660731.0,We also have wooden blinds in the majority of our house and loooooove them. Also have white wooden ones but the natural wood color and sunlight coming in is just sooo much calming and nicer to looks at to me 😁
nostalgia,ff6gh92,t3_erwz1e,1579626679.0,I had the top middle one!
nostalgia,ff5xbxs,t3_erqhnv,1579613350.0,I had Ms. Piggy!!
Hawaii,ff5eltv,t1_ff5dms7,1579589569.0,And alway have Kleenex or tissue in case there is no more toilet paper. And yes hand sanitizer bc some parks and it’s not region specific bc I was at a state park in IL and they had wonderful bathrooms with real toilets but absolutely no soap. So glad I had hand sanitizer with.
aww,ff5dx1v,t3_erqr9e,1579588793.0,I do this too! And most of the time it’s not for the occasion it’s just a funny or cute card that I just like to share.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,ff5cexf,t3_erqa5t,1579587163.0,So I’m looking at this photo at night in bed and my brightness is low and legit thought the dog was in a flying saucer lmao but then I see it’s on a huge ass bean bag on a couch. Got a laugh outta me. Good night lol
nostalgia,ff5acil,t3_ero6db,1579585092.0,I must say that the small pony on top and then the regular pony in the back is unique lol I thought at first the small pony is holding the bangs but nope the bangs are down on at least the older girl.
flicks,ff4hlbw,t1_ff1bgqq,1579563800.0,Watched it Friday and was really good. I especially loved their little skit! Don’t want to spoil things but it was so well done...the kids were all great.
nostalgia,ff3yf0a,t3_eriac6,1579551573.0,I as well forgot it existed until I was looking at Disney pc games from back in the day and had my own “forgot it existed until I saw it” moment!
whatisthisthing,ff3jcgi,t3_erecnz,1579542277.0,We once bought a piece of pottery in Colorado kind of in the shape of that and it came with its own  black metal stand to sit in as a souvenir for someone. The person who we bought it for sometimes puts a few dried flower things in it but for the most part the opening is very narrow and it’s just a decorative piece. Maybe that’s what this is kinda?
instant_regret,ff35c4e,t1_ff2sj61,1579534047.0,Yea same. I know you are supposed to have a leash but all my time snowboarding over the states they are really rare to see in use. Though one time my cousin went boarding in flagstaff and did get yelled at for not having a leash by a worker there but that was years ago and I wasn’t with her.
instant_regret,ff34zuq,t1_ff2suck,1579533813.0,Yes! Years back was at a resort in Colorado I don’t remember which one but basically my group decided to go off into the trees by a run. There were plenty of people doing it and I had done it plenty in the past but I didn’t have enough speed to go over this little bump in the snow and so I drifted back off the bump and slowly started sinking in the fresh powder as I was still attached the the board. I sunk in waist deep and was freaking out. People from my group came back and wrestled me out but it took forever bc they were trying not to sink as well. Last time I ever went into the trees. 😖
chicago,ff1pk5o,t3_er40th,1579483324.0,My favorites are Hobohemia and Death Corner.
books,ff0sfzb,t1_ff0o94a,1579471861.0,Yea after struggling to read one of the books I went online and saw a lot of discussion about the same issues I had so was glad to see it wasn’t just me.
mildlyinfuriating,ff05jw9,t1_ff04i0v,1579465405.0,Same. I’m a woman. If you sit more up front on the toilet and your stream is strong it totally will got forward and down the outside of the toilet. Also kids are notorious for not paying attention and as a kid I sometimes didn’t wipe after peeing while I was still seated and I would stand up first thus dribbling on the toilet seat and then it would dribble down the toilet and then I would wipe. Got yelled at enough about that 🤦🏻‍♀️
CozyPlaces,fezy8cm,t3_er0lon,1579463163.0,Ahh love that area of NM!
books,fezt6v6,t3_er0mti,1579461335.0,Wrinkle in time series. I always enjoyed the first book but I got a lovely box set and was trying to make my way through it and I think I made it thru the second book but couldn’t make it thru the third. Kept the first book and gave away the others.

chicago,fezkow9,t1_fezd2t7,1579458337.0,Yes. Garage is best. Not to mention then you don’t need to clean any snow off your car either!
chicago,fezii3g,t1_fezalvg,1579457704.0,Oooo they have one more season left maybe they can fit this in. It can be his last great scheme ha
aww,fezhhyc,t3_eqyx6h,1579457404.0,Aw man cute pup and some nice 101 Dalmatian sheets! I had a few different kinds of my own back in the day ha
poland,fewplzn,t1_fewgtkp,1579417597.0,Can confirm. Lots of polish delis and stores in Chicago and the area and I have bought it multiple times 😁
nostalgia,fewmmqw,t3_eqn1zg,1579414831.0,Sooo much Avon!! For a time it seemed like every woman sold it. My mom bought a lot of the perfume and other things from them. She totally had that bottle for sure.
whatisthisthing,fewfxol,t1_feugeqp,1579409934.0,Came here to say that and now I need to watch it again!
witcher,fevfeq8,t3_eqp4mv,1579396778.0,O man I just noticed the “gooseberries” on the other one!
witcher,fev9k3c,t1_fev9ckp,1579394768.0,Good to hear. I prefer the peaty ones so anything from Islay is a win for me and Ardbeg hasn’t let me down yet.
witcher,fev7mty,t3_eqp4mv,1579394139.0,I love Ardbeg! I have not seen that one though.
nostalgia,feu07zj,t3_eqlle4,1579381811.0,We didn’t have this. Teachers had a pad of hall passes and they would fill one out and rip it off the pad and that was your hall pass! But interesting to see a notebook one!
trashy,fetysrp,t1_fetvor6,1579381420.0,Thank you! I also know there was/is a big Czech population too. I follow a Facebook group called Bohemians in America (I have German and Czech and other things ancestry wise). There are also a lot a posts about Czech things in Texas.
chicago,fetl7lz,t3_eqkypb,1579376489.0,It was on the list of fast food places that we regularly had growing up and was never a fan. Idk if they changed it since I had it back in the day but I remember it just cold cuts and some tough ass bread.
whatsthisplant,fetkc9n,t3_eql2z9,1579376308.0,Oooo yea I bought one from Ikea and was really nice but sadly I killed it somehow 😖
trashy,feti27n,t1_fetgyg8,1579375628.0,Yea that’s what I hear about Austin.  Good to know the specific areas.  Will visit it one day!
trashy,fetf2q5,t1_fes1q8v,1579374792.0,Was up in TC not too long ago and definitely has areas of artsy vibes but then outdoorsy vibes and then we went to a Meadery that was total hippie vibes. Was a cool city to visit but again haven’t spent long there I don’t truly know what it’s like nor the locals.  Would def visit up there again though.
pics,fesu3bw,t1_fesszeh,1579368987.0,Ooooo they have a good amount of mosquitos up there from what I read but maybe only certain areas of Canada get more so than others.
pics,fesss0o,t3_eqg7h7,1579368647.0,I’ve seen a lot of pictures like this but haven’t seen screen doors. Screen doors in addition to the regular door are pretty common in the US I like to think.  You can get some air with it and it’s just an additional security door too. I mean in this case it wouldn’t make a difference with the snow but just an observation from seeing photos like this a lot.
chicago,fepamx2,t1_fep801s,1579315898.0,Kinda like King of the Hill? Ha
aww,fepaizo,t1_fep6fmn,1579315824.0,Awww! That’s even cuter!
aww,fep6750,t3_eqa94e,1579313030.0,💓the island Maui. What a name for a cute pup!
whatisthisthing,feoxxir,t3_eq97dh,1579307793.0,Maybe something  more horizontal like a kayak or skis? Hard to tell how wide or far apart they are.
Vikings_TvSeries,feoh9sa,t1_feoaiqo,1579300104.0,It doesn’t show Travis as being credited with being in the episode. But yea I wish he really had a guest appearance and was something better then a sand outline/image.
Vikings_TvSeries,feo62m1,t1_feo47bo,1579295589.0,O I cried too! I cried when they were all saying good bye to her on her ship and then yes when her and Ragnar were together again. 😭
shameless,fenro9b,t1_fenkhu3,1579289763.0,O no Debbie! Who would get her daughter then?! Maybe Veronica and Kev bc Kev went thru the stage of wanting more kids ha
shameless,fenri3y,t1_fenoelc,1579289710.0,I really really love your idea of the house being torn down and diner after!  They would have to do cgi of the house being torn down or something else unless the current owners would agree to do it ha.
maui,fem441c,t3_eptx0m,1579239099.0,I can only speak for the rest of the US bc I only vacation to Maui and not live there. But he regained popularity in help to Netflix had some of his old stuff for awhile and yea just his philosophy in general. He did some Florida beach scene paintings since he lived there on and off I think so that’s a tropical vibe so maybe that’s why? Just a guess. I know art stores I have been too where I live in the US all have a good size section of just his products.
witcher,felszci,t3_epub4c,1579230177.0,Keep checking B&N online. I looked one day and it wasn’t available to buy. Waited a few days and checked again and it was in stock again and I should be getting it tomorrow yay!
europe,feju704,t1_fejrvus,1579185941.0,Yes! The plan we are thinking at the moment is  road trip from Barcelona to Malaga.
AskReddit,fejosh4,t3_epduqa,1579181905.0,Getting a Masters degree in Library Science to become a Librarian. The only people who I found that found it hard were people who had no library experience at all. Majority of the people in classes already were working at a library so everything was pretty easy myself included. Sounded so scary and hard bc ooooo Masters degree but nope!
nostalgia,fejo8wf,t3_epeajq,1579181442.0,The Honeycomb cereal mascot must be related to them ha
europe,fejn895,t3_epj24s,1579180548.0,Thank you for this. Might be going to Spain this summer and just started researching. Just might have to stop by here. 😁

nostalgia,feidpe3,t1_fei6b0c,1579136103.0,Mentos was a church candy for a bit. My younger brother LOVED them so my mom always had them in her purse for him ha
whatisthisthing,fehnnt9,t1_fehndu0,1579120217.0,Oooo that’s true! I have seen big pots of those in that style pot.
whatisthisthing,fehnhfg,t3_ep7tcl,1579120115.0,"There are a lot of pots made without drainage holes actually.  I only use pots with drainage holes but I have come across a fair share of pots without at Lowe’s, Home Depot etc."
witcher,feh2vbl,t1_feh2mz7,1579108003.0,You are welcome and enjoy reading!!
witcher,feh2c1m,t1_feh22gz,1579107677.0,And it looks like they are all translated by Danusia Stok so should be all the same then.
witcher,feh22gz,t1_fegzkef,1579107521.0,"Yes, from what I understand the Little Brown & Company and the Orbit edition 2008 since they have the same page length and I guess the same main publisher it should be the same book. The other book you listed the Gollancz published one since it has way less page numbers than the Orbit/Little Brown it probably doesn’t have the extra excerpts of other materials in them."
witcher,fegyqgg,t1_fegxynk,1579105498.0,Ah it says the Little Brown and Company is published in the US as Orbit so that’s why it has the same page count as the Orbit one published in 2008.
witcher,fegxo5b,t1_fegxc1f,1579104834.0,Update. Orbit also has an older paperback edition from 2008 that shows 384 pages so I am guessing it’s just more excerpts from other books. The paperback I referenced in my previous comment was published in 2017 and the hardcover from 2019.
witcher,fegxc1f,t3_ep45is,1579104625.0,I only know of the Orbit published versions in the the US. There is a hardcover and paperback and according to Barnes and Noble website they have the same page length at 352. I have the hardcover and there are extras in it. There is an excerpt of another Witcher book and an excerpt from another fantasy book by a different author.  What publisher are you looking at?
chicago,feggnoz,t1_fegf5tl,1579092138.0,Omg he does!
boardgames,feft09e,t1_fed1d7p,1579064298.0,IT IS THE WAY
Libraries,fefimjj,t3_emge72,1579057100.0,Also patrons call to ask about something on their account but don’t have their library card ready. We always need to get the card number due to numerous reasons and the regulars always go “oops I forgot again! Hang on!” While I wait minutes on end...

AnimalsBeingDerps,fedr8s9,t1_fedq1ux,1579018166.0,Omg I remember the metal blinds and those could do serious damage! They were noisy too.
pics,feddb9q,t1_fed332t,1579008293.0,"Mini splits! They are awesome! We have them in our house in the US bc it is old and has radiator heating so was less of a mess to install mini splits rather then traditional central ac. Saw a lot of mini splits in Florida’s keys, Italy, Maui, etc. they are more expensive but worth it."
witcher,fecoqw8,t1_fecoip0,1578979349.0,This is correct. I am just finishing up Last Wish and all I have found online are lists saying that Sword of Destiny is the second books so that’s what I plan on doing.
whatsthatbook,fecm4rg,t1_feclg13,1578977315.0,It was in the first Percy movie so Wikipedia says so must be in the first book.

nostalgia,fe92f23,t1_fe8txsd,1578933415.0,Yay! Glad I found someone who has seen it! Yes! Especially since I first saw it when I was around 10 and the cute puppy on the front of the box at Blockbuster didn’t prepare me for the actual movie.
nostalgia,fe8qxfy,t3_eo5l4v,1578929575.0,Ahhh I can smell the plastic and it would absorb the food odors over time too.  Did it have a matching thermos? My family never used the thermoses so I was always jealous of the kids who did and brought like soup or pasta and other things in it.
boardgames,fe7ze49,t3_eo3sq8,1578920810.0,In my experience everyone does love uno....young and old. Easy to understand and easy to carry with you. And there are different versions like Uno Flip that adds just a little more difficulty to it.
nostalgia,fe6l0rr,t3_enx1cs,1578894416.0,At my school parents could opt their kids out. Majority of kids in my class opted out...there were only a few who ever went and afterwards we would questions the kids what went on ha. I mean our family dr. checked us out for this so why would we do it again thru school? Googling this brought up a lot of results wow.
nostalgia,fe6krc4,t3_enyp48,1578894154.0,I had a My Little Pony one!
nottheonion,fe5pm19,t1_fe2xj8f,1578872660.0,Yea I mean it looks like a pretty thin mattress so it wouldn’t be any effort at all to remove it and put in on the floor. And one can always just pile up the blankets on the floor and make a little love nest there ha
whatisthisthing,fe3uqgy,t3_enpmpl,1578853089.0,Off topic but I love your ruler! Ha
poland,fe3u3u7,t1_fdqwhvi,1578852893.0,Yes! We were looking at June and August dates and August by far had some great direct flight deals from Chicago to Kraków.

chicago,fe2w4tn,t1_fe0e1ln,1578843492.0,O one more thing. The law changed recently and citizens and nationals of Poland will be able to travel visa free to the US now. I know it was a hassle sometimes to get a US visa to the states so I imagine that travel will only increase now between the two countries since becoming visa free now.
space,fe2rstu,t1_fe2pc5w,1578842186.0,I have the Nikon coolpix p900 and it has crazy zoom and a moon setting and I get pictures just like this and it’s around $500-$600. There is a newer model that has a much larger zoom but so much heavier and more expensive.
chicago,fe0ck5f,t3_enjry5,1578809829.0,There is still a sizable enough population of polish people in the area since airlines feel there is a need and are offering direct flights. A lot of polish people who were born in the Chicago area have family back in Poland and visit a lot. And a lot of older Polish people have retired back to Poland but still enjoy visiting the Chicago area for family that still live here. I’m not polish but I do have polish family and friends that live in the city and suburbs and can confirm that they do fly to Poland often. Also Lot won’t be the only direct option now...I think American is or will be doing direct flights soon too.
aww,fe0c1lt,t3_enjtq6,1578809283.0,Is there another cat there? Like the back end looks off...but I can’t see two separate cats that distinctly...hmmmm

nostalgia,fdzy9hr,t3_en7xbt,1578798739.0,I have to say it. My favorite part of the show were the Doc and Sprocket parts. I liked the Fraggles too but really wanted a Doc and Sprocket show 😂
Hawaii,fdzxp3i,t3_en3n2z,1578798338.0,Yea idk what he is asking bc we have plenty of stores that have mangos in Chicago. Unlikely though that you would be able to get them specifically from Hawaii.
coolguides,fdzwfiu,t3_enat8e,1578797433.0,When me and my husband bought our first mattress together the Queen bed in the store seemed sooooo huge. Order it and get home and realize after putting blankets and pillows and my body pillow on it it’s not so huge.  We already had a brand new queen bedroom set so we had to stick with the Queen. We will be upgrading to a King next time for sure ha.
