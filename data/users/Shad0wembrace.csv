dogs,ffg2hdt,t1_fffpsdq,1579897032.0,"I used to live in San Antonio, Texas and it is a MAJORLY COMMON THEME there, especially in the southside.  I worked Animal Control so the amount of blatant disregard for animals in that city is just crazy.  I never knew it could be so bad until I moved there and started working animal control.  People let their dogs run free, not spayed or neutered, lots of dog dumpings, lots of dogs with mange, it's really bad there.    


Now I live in Richmond, VA area, and I see it sometimes.    


In fact, my neighbor lets his dogs run free in his yard daily.  Not fenced in.  Because in the city I live (not Richmond) it is LEGAL to allow your dogs off leash on YOUR PROPERTY.   I know this because another neighbor fought with my current neighbor regarding a pit they had that charged at me (and another neighbor) multiple times.  They finally got rid of said dog, but still have another.  He seems more friendly but I haven't been out while he's off leash to see.

UKC is the same thing with it actually being a SERIOUS FAULT if they are over 7lbs.

http://www.americanpomeranianclub.org/about_poms.htm

The Pomeranian standard calls for a dog which is between 3 and 7 pounds; has small erect ears; a thick double coat (long guard hairs held off the body by a soft fluffy undercoat) which is an all-weather protectant against heat, cold, rain or snow; a tail covered with long hair which lies flat over the back; and a pronounced stop which gives it the appearance of a high forehead. Most correctly sized Poms, there is no such thing as a Teacup or Toy Pomeranian - they are a toy breed, are between 4 and 7 pounds.
     It is not uncommon for poorly bred Pomeranians to be ""over standard"" - to exceed the weight limit set forth in the breed standard - with many weighing from 10 to 15 pounds. Poor quality Pomeranians are also usually lacking an undercoat to hold up the guard hairs and do not have a pronounced stop causing their heads to resemble their larger Nordic cousins. All Poms should have small, almond shaped eyes but it is not uncommon for both normal sized and over standard Poms to have large, round eyes."

In fact I sucked so hard I only made 4 points the entire time playing for 2 years (for both jr Varsity and varsity).  Well we were playing a home game and I actually got the ball, was wide open, and sunk it.  I don't really remember the score, if we were winning or losing (I imagine winning as we didn't lose but one or two games the entire time), but my entire school went ballistic.   Acting like it was a home game game winning shot.

My dad had died in 08, and my mom was my  best friend and when she died she was my rock... so it was everything I knew, the one person I could go to day in and day out, was gone.  My best friend ever in this entire world who I always could depend on was no longer a person I could ever talk to, see or be with again.    


I became super depressed.  I ended up quitting my job.  I spent her insurance money on frivolous things to make myself happy..trips to Las Vegas, New York, California...   Sure, I had fun with these trips, the memories I made were great, but I still was depressed.  I'd sleep in for 12-18 hours a day.  I wouldn't eat.  I tried meds, but I hated how they made me feel, so I decided I needed/wanted a dog.  I ended up contacting a breeder referred to me by a friend.  And in August I went and picked up my two puppies I purchased.    


It was like...a life changing experience.  No longer could I just sit in bed for 18 hours and not get out/up.  I was responsible for another living being that had to go out every few hours for potty training, that needed socializing, training, love.  That had to be fed.   People saw a difference in me too.. I started going out more, I was happier.

Pets,fcky1qg,t3_ehnpsl,1577735641.0,"My dogs recently started sleeping with me..probably 3-4 days out of the week.  The reason they weren't sleeping with me before is because I had an elderly blind cat that they were too rough with/wouldn't pay attention to and it was too dangerous for her to keep them out and TBH I spoiled her so she got whatever she wanted which was to sleep with me.  I was finally forced to put her down about 3 weeks ago because her organ failure got too much and she stopped walking.  Ever since then the girls sleep with me on and off.    


I have noticed my bed gets a bit more dirt in it, but I just make sure to keep a blanket over the top and just shake it out before we get in.  Normally one dog lays down by my feet, the other two lay on either side of me, or on my left side together (more room for b oth of them).  I have three dogs total, one is around 28lbs, the other two are 35-45lbs, and standard poodles.    


They all get weekly/monthly baths so never really any dirt.  I normally decide if they'll be crated or sleep with me depending on how tired I am and how late it is.  If it's the weekend they normally sleep with em til about 7-8, then we go outside, tehy come in, I crate them for a few hours and get extended sleeping in. xD"

Does anyone else think that Leia had sort of ""possessed"" Kylo Ren after Rey saved him?  I don't think Kylo would've just up and decided to change his ways after almost dying and being saved by Rey.  I think Leia possessed him to help save Rey because Leia knew it was the only way they would win.  It's why Kylo doesn't appear at the end with Luke and Leia at the Skywalker house.    


Also, I hate the kiss they did at the end with Kylo and Rey, absolutely unnecessary."
AKC,fcktxjt,t3_ehibps,1577733115.0,"1. Are the parents on site?  Can you meet them? 
2. Where are the puppies raised?  Inside?  outside?  With or without puppy culture?
3. Are they shown?  Do they have CH or GC parents?  If not shown, why not?
4. OFA and CHIC testing for each breed is different, make sure they are GENETICALLY TESTED for diseases the breed may carry and OFA done for at least Hips and Heart I think are generally done on every breed.  Sometimes Elbow and eyes depending on breed. 
5. Google the breed, read the breed standard, look up the parent club for the breed and make sure they don't have any issues/what their issues are.  An example, is people are currently monetizing the ""Merle Poodle"".  The Merle gene does not exist in the Poodle, but there are people out there who are lying about it and saying their merle poodle is a purebred poodle. 
6. Make sure they have their own questionnaire.  If a breeder says ""you can just have a puppy"", they aren't in it for the long run.  A responsible breeder will screen their buyers as well.  
7. Social media presence involving website.  Does it look okay?    


A HUGE RED FLAG is just someone that says ""Breeds AKC Champions"".  And the dogs aren't actually shown.  They are just monetizing on a dog or dogs in the pedigree that were shown.  I ALWAYS go with someone who is currently showing, whether in UKC or AKC."

Plus the shipping was about $15.  So overall, $70 for a 16oz ear cleaner.  I thought, this can't be right.  Decided to see if Amazon had it.  They did.  for $20.  That's right.  The vet marked it up an extra $24.

blizzcon,fca0fxs,t1_fc9lysh,1577560948.0,"Why do people keep saying they are at least $400 a night?  It can be if you wait til the last minute.  

Last year, my stay from 29th-5th was $2,060.00.  Each night was $248.64.  

The year before that, in a KING SUITE I paid $364 a night for a total of $3k.  [TBH, I splurged more that year then past years, that's why I got the suite which obviously was more expensive then normal rooms.]

In 2016 I stayed at the Marriott but booked through my work so I'm not sure how much I paid.  I had The Hilton booked and it was a total of $1,694 for 4th-10th for Nov so I'm guessing around $285 a night.  

In 2015 I stayed Nov 4-10th at the Marriott and paid $249.00 a night.  Ever since that year, I haven't seen Marriott available for anything less than $500 a night.  Even the week of the convention, or months ahead of time.  I think that Blizzard bought out at that hotel for their staff.  

2014 I stayed at Marriott again, rooms were $159.00 a night.  

The last itinerary I have saved after that was in 2011 but it won't let me see it and keeps saying it's unavailable.  But I know that was the year I stayed at Hilton as well."

What you mean to say is you cannot define an animal by its breed if it's a mixed OR if the breed is bred by irresponsible, back yard breeders.

A morally, ethical and responsible breeder will be able to tell you the standard personality of the breed it's breeding."
