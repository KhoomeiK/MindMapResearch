Unfortunately there are shitty people out there who will fabricate situations like this to try and scam people out of their money.

Don't fool yourself into thinking that these deniers actually don't believe in climate change and that they haven't already heavily invested in the technologies that we are going to need to effect positive climate change.

cybersecurity,fencso1,t3_eq2yv3,1579281927.0,Most networks do not use encryption internally. Main reason is so that your employer can track what you are doing. They will probably claim it eliminates overhead blah blah blah. It's so you can be tracked. Any HTTPS connection you initiate externally will likely be going a proxy so not private either (from your employers point of view).  Bottom line if an attacker can get on your network that http connection is the least of your concerns. Never allow http connections to enter or leave your network if you can avoid it.
todayilearned,fenaze1,t3_eq2zfk,1579280812.0,FYI even if they are both positive (infected from other people) they still need to use protection because of HIVs high mutation rate they likely have different strains. They could get another infection of HIV which would likely accelerate full immune failure (AIDS).

NoStupidQuestions,fen9uxs,t3_eq2o7t,1579280114.0,"ELI5, proceating with closely related relatives can be dangerous for offspring. Bad genes are usually recessive (weak), rare, and can run in families (carriers) without any issues, so they often remain hidden. So when you meet a random person, the chances of them also having a bad gene is low. They most likely have the dominant (strong) version of the gene which will make the offspring healthy. The problem with keeping it in the family is that if you are both carriers then the child can only get a recessive (weak) version of the gene and they will be affected. If you look at pictures and histories of royal families who inter-bred extensively you can see how bad genes where passed from generation to generation. 

TL;DR. It's usually unacceptable, mainly to keep the population healthy."
assholedesign,fen9307,t3_eq2o9f,1579279640.0,Its the way it needs to be. If you don't force people to do updates they won't do them. It's those computers with known vulnerabilities which are easily taken over and wreak Havok on everyone else. Stupid people need to be protected from themselves sometimes.

You can make it a point to rinse your mouth out regularly at work letting people casually know you do it. The cough syrup would only work periodically. All in all don't recommend going to work with alcohol. If something were to happen to you, or even worse someone else because of you. You would probably be denied coverage or charged."
