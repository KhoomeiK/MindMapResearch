WhiskeyTribe,fexo9mk,t1_fewqfrx,1579433938.0,"I see now. Just looked around and found that liquor ads are on TV now. I've not have any cable for the last 10 years and as such catch very little actual TV. So, I was still under the impression that they were not on the boobtube and only in magazines or online. 

Live and learn."
WhiskeyTribe,fewo4j1,t1_fewiaxs,1579416701.0,What marketing? All I ever see on whisk(e)y forums is word of mouth and the lack of distribution making people then more willing to pay the markup  when they do find it.
cats,fewntj3,t1_fewf6n9,1579416155.0,Right. Wants your attention comes and gets it. Doesn't need you to be there 25 hours a day. But misses you if you don't follow your normal patern.

cats,fec6b4w,t1_fe9t10f,1578967360.0,I'm not being clever. Just pointing out the real reason. A lot of people confuse cat behavior for the wrong thing. To us to looks sweet. And is because he is accepting the little guy into his family.
cats,fe7u0jj,t3_eo2bnd,1578919240.0,Looks sweet to us but is just the cat marking territory. He has claimed the little one as his.
Warframe,fe7ti15,t1_fe7mlbm,1578919102.0,"That's a bullshit answer and poor excuse not to do something. They know what is being built and can write a script to crawl through the data and refund any excess mats that are changed while in current builds and inventory. If you scrapped them after building then you are SOL.

&#x200B;

Or barring that. They can scrape the data and give and average of mats used back to everyone regardless of having built or not."

WhiskeyTribe,fdmgcaa,t3_elumq0,1578548957.0,"Hey it's me. Your friend. 

Joking aside. Great find. I found a bottle of  the SR for 30 in a local  liquor store. After talking to a couple of other store owners  found they were going for 45. And the price will be higher the next shipment.  

Needless to say I went back a grabbed the one for 30. It's a screw top. But I got it."
WhiskeyTribe,fdk9bmq,t1_fdjxm6y,1578499005.0,You don't want to try to age at 80 proof. Would lose too much to evaporation and then would turn into wood flavored water.
WhiskeyTribe,fdjltxk,t1_fdje6sp,1578477074.0,"That age statement is the part that always gets me. I keep thinking that it has to be aged a minimum of 2 years to be called a whiskey.

&#x200B;

So, by US law that is a whiskey and not moonshine. I hate technically correct sometimes."
WhiskeyTribe,fdj83k5,t3_elj6iz,1578461138.0,I have headache just looking at it. Can that even be called whiskey?

Thanks for the heads up you MB SD brother. And you are welcome too."
WhiskeyTribe,fdcjxcu,t1_fdcfw16,1578276748.0,"Ah misread the store line. I'd say that if you are close enough to the border then it's like not living there. Glad to hear you can find things.

WhiskeyTribe,fdcfj7k,t1_fdcezdy,1578273644.0,Nice to be in a non controlled state right.
WhiskeyTribe,fd20c0l,t1_fd1qix2,1578139669.0,"I would guess that because after the repeal of the 18th amendment the federal government didn't set up any rules for alcohol and left it up for each state to decide. 

As some states elected to remain in full control/limiting of their alcohol sales. I guess it's mainly to prevent the residents of those states from bypassing the price fixing the the state has on the sales of alcohol. You know it's what every form of government hates the most, Tax evasion."
WhiskeyTribe,fd0hspn,t1_fcxopd6,1578118998.0,For my area. The 3 bottle samplers are $25. For a 750ml of the 12 yr its $50-55. Is the 750 higher for you?
bladesinthedark,fcugkg3,t3_eixqfp,1577980446.0,"If you don't want it to derail your current focus. Downplay it. Have the main contact brush it aside like you have played. 

If the players press the issue you can remind them that they would not be here without their help. Treat it as a debt to be repaided.

If you want to keep it as a thread for later then go conspiracy like lean in and tell them they need to do more to find out.

As for what it is go with what you want it to be or what the group thinks up on the fly. Your players can give you better ideas if you just tease the idea of something more than what is there."

WhiskeyTribe,fckg3j8,t1_fckd83y,1577724550.0,"That is great to hear but, again depending where he lives he could be breaking the law. And as such I'd caution to not post on a public forum until he is legally able to purchase/consume. 

These are the only states that allow private home consumption without parental consent. 

 Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, Oklahoma, South Carolina 

&#x200B;

Please respect your local laws regarding this. I know it's fun to do things that could get you into trouble if reported. But it is not worth the cost of your freedom and money if someone decides to out you."
WhiskeyTribe,fckci58,t3_ehmcm9,1577722241.0,"Err on the side of caution. 

If ""your"" friend is just under 21. Lurk. Gather information on the styles and plot a course for when you can legally enter the fray (USA is my basis). 

&#x200B;

Enjoy the tomfoolery and shenanigans.

&#x200B;

""He"" would really want to think about posting/participating on a Sprites related forum  on a public social media platform if ""he"" is further under than 20. 

&#x200B;

Realize that this is a place for the enjoyment of the various forms whisk(e)y can take and not about getting drunk. Since ""he"" can't legally (in most cases) have alcohol (in the US).

Please have ""him"" look here  [https://drinkingage.procon.org/states-that-allow-underage-under-21-alcohol-consumption/](https://drinkingage.procon.org/states-that-allow-underage-under-21-alcohol-consumption/) 

and look over any local  county and city ordinances for further information on what is allowed where ""he"" lives. ""He"" wouldn't want to get others into trouble for providing him with alcohol."
