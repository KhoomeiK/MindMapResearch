Yet, I don't understand when this subreddit became so focused around posts about pets who've died. Sure, that definitely sucks, but that's *way* too much suck for what this subreddit seems to aim for.

 I thought this subreddit was for things like gifs of a dude bailing a skateboard trick and having it fall down a stormdrain, or a girl dancing at a party and falling over and spilling her beer over herself. You know, things that suck *but are funny to watch*

Again, I feel for OP, but this sub detracts value from my life by now making me think about losing my own dog on a weekly basis. 

It's just /r/pics, a regular photo with a gut-wrenching title that only makes you sad/virtue signalled.

Maybe make something like /r/mourning or the like for posts like this instead. People can post and view expecting that, not us whose feeds now consist of funny gif, funny gif, dead pet, funny picture. 

This sub just has way too weird of a divide. I don't wanna leave and lose the funny stuff, but the sad stuff just fucks my day too much to warrant staying subbed here.

If that's the new direction the mods want, they should sticky a post or something so those of us who don't want to bear this can fuck off"
