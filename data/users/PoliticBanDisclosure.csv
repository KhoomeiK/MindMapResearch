teenagers,ffe6q1f,t3_et0g04,1579838167.0,"Not a teenager, but I have teenagers. Some parents are just shitty at communicating. Some are just shitty people. I had a shitty parenting situation and the one thing I learned from it as a kid is thats exactly how I would never realize my kids.

If you take anything from this situation, take the fact that you now know exactly what not to do one day when you have your own child.

Good luck."

politics,ffe33t7,t1_ffe08qx,1579835444.0,"Seriously? What if they did that in their mid 30s with kids? Theyre saddled with large loans plus trying to take care of the kids?

Youre delusional if you think its going to make a wealth gap with the middle class. If you have a family that has special needs youd be amazed how quickly any extra money goes to things like therapy, medicines, special clothing, the list literally goes on.

Wiping out student debt which was created by colleges jacking up rates because the government increased loans willingly to match these college rates is the only right thing to do as well as making education free for all.

If you make 100k a year, 16k of that roughly goes to healthcare. Taxes each another roughly 23%

Youre making roughly 60k after that. 60k doesnt go very far at all when you account for those things I just mentioned. Theres no money left to put away for savings or for your kids. It all goes to increased food bills, excessive medical costs, constant car repairs, increasing rents or mortgages.

We were on SNAP and state healthcare for most of our lives until we had the chance to supposedly pull ourselves up by the bootstraps and take on massive student debt. We were less stressed out then than we are now. Mostly because we knew our kids would get the health care they needed. Now we cant afford 80% of the prescribed therapies and the state wont pay for the tools needed to help them because we make too much.

So no, I fully disagree with you assuming there will she a wealth gap. Thats some centrist democrat messaging if I ever heard it."
politics,ffdy9v4,t1_ffdwql3,1579831928.0,"Were not at that point yet? Look I dont mean to come off rash but that sounds like a point of privilege your comment is being made from.

Our family was on SNAP and State health for 7 years. We lived in projects with bars on windows. Only able to afford food that was horrible for you.
We managed to dig out only because of sheer luck.

For a large portion of this country it is the same. Too poor to move out of rural areas because theres no jobs to build a fund with. Too poor to afford an education because your family was poor. The recession, companies may have recovered but the fabric of our society sure as hell didnt.

So Im going to strongly disagree with you in that were not at that point yet. Couple all that with the people we have on the street because of no mental health care... it makes the ramifications of Black Tuesday a joke."

politics,ffdknrf,t1_ffdigly,1579822898.0,"Exactly! Capitalism DOES work! When its WELL REGULATED!

The GOP has done its damndest to deregulate anything and everything and theres been plenty of cooperate Dems to blame as well.

Capitalism with an integrated social system well managed and regulated is what America will thrive under.

You cant have just one of them. Not just capitalism. Not just social policies. They are two systems that need to be married together. It will literally make America great again.

Well be better educated because of better education from free college/ trade systems.

Well have better infrastructure from unionized trade deals.

Well all have housing because its a basic human right.

Well all have medical care because its a basic human right.

This means we have more jobs in trades and medical which we can quickly fill because well have free education that EVERYONE can use whether they are poor OR rich!

And how do we pay for this? 

Easy! Medicare for all is cheaper than our current bloated system by several trillion dollars. The Koch brothers ran their own study on it and found the damning truth themselves.

Well also defund the military because the current contracts are mismanaged like hell and were in forever wars all over the place that we dont need to be in. We protect our own soil and invest in better defenses and cyber training .. again more jobs from that free education system.

Anyone telling you this is a pipe dream or fairy tail is someone trying to make sure we have no equality and share of power and wealth.

The progressive movement is real and its not just sanders or warren. Together they are bringing something to the forefront that my generation has been trying to do since Occupy Wall Street. We were young dumb and ignorant but now we understand and we have maneuvered ourselves in to positions of power to implement the change we have been begging for for decades."

A server handles thousands of players spread amongst various zones vs a server handling thousands people in just a few zones. One breaks the system and requires further optimization but part of the help is people out leveling areas and moving in to new zones.

This is every mmo ever. WoW on release for the first few weeks had massive server problems. Part of it was sheer load of people and they needed more hardware and part of it was tough love where people just had to put up with the ups and downs until the population got streamlined more through the zones.

Claire McCaskill said something similar of him,  I believe. That he approached things from a moral superiority stand point. No one wants to work with someone who isnt going to enrich them when it comes to the US Senate.

The biggest joke all along is the fact that the US Senate is the premiere oligarch system in the world. They profit off of the people and do nothing for them.

Sanders has a decades long track record of not doing that. So Clinton makes herself an easy target as god knows what she did and said in the 90s. She has her own track record and it isnt one of helping people.

The fact theyre trying to paint Sanders as a misogynistic insane. Hes literally stated for decades that a woman could be President and he has helped many women start their political careers.

Anything Clinton says should be laughed at."
politics,ff9q2qw,t1_ff9mhdx,1579718438.0,"Trump came to office with the support of independents who were low information voters. Trump literally said during a rally he loves the uneducated. The uneducated took that to mean he loved them and wanted to help them; not that he loved them because he could easily exploit them.

They realize they were conned now but the base is so rabid the congress cant do anything without being tweeted at lest they lose their power.

Ultimately we must remember that the GOP and a fair amount of Dems are not there to make our lives better. They are there for the power they get.

Its time we remind them of that and I strongly believe that 2020 will make 2018 look like a ripple in terms of the disapproval the American people have of the way the GOP led senate and White House are operating.

America works because there is some guise of fairness. We all know its not fair, especially if you are a female or you are not white or if you dont conform to a prescribed sexuality. Im a white male with children that are trans, lesbian, and one that is autistic. Seeing the hardships they go through on a weekly basis will wake any parent up in a hurry and thats the majority of this country at this time.

2020 is going to be a seismic shift in values.. weve been trending right for far too long, the course correction Martin Luther King had us on will be focused on once again.

But for some context, we were on food stamps, state health care, all while working low paying medical jobs with 3 kids(our last one ended up being special needs so I had to stay home) and going to school taking on massive student loan debt.

Because of those welfare programs my wife was able to finish a masters degree and after another certification in 2 years we may go from making 80k(we made 32k before she got her masters) a year to making maybe 200k a year if everything pans out.

We had to take on 20k in medical debt even with premium health insurance. Were filing for bankruptcy but will be able to keep our house due to state exemptions. Its going to give us a restart button.

Establishment Dems might be marginally better but people like myself arent going to care about getting out to vote if theyre in the position we used to be in. Our lives were already miserable. If it GOP and establishment Dems are a difference between shit and not as shit, this demographic just doesnt vote. Only if you come at them showing youre taking them in your back and carrying them with you to a better life will they get on the ground and pound doors for you.

So yes there is some merit to keep you asleep but theres a lot of context missing as to why progressives are a fickle voting bloc. Its very simple. Candidates fighting for great change and a better overall life are candidates that win handedly. Time and time again.

But sanders has great ideas too and I would be absolutely thrilled if he wins the nomination. Theyre just as scared of him as they are warren.

You’re delusional if you think it’s going to make a wealth gap with the middle class. If you have a family that has special needs you’d be amazed how quickly any ‘extra’ money goes to things like therapy, medicines, special clothing, the list literally goes on.

Wiping out student debt which was created by colleges jacking up rates because the government increased loans willingly to match these college rates is the only right thing to do as well as making education free for all.

If you make 100k a year, 16k of that roughly goes to healthcare. Taxes each another roughly 23%

You’re making roughly 60k after that. 60k doesn’t go very far at all when you account for those things I just mentioned. There’s no money left to put away for savings or for your kids. It all goes to increased food bills, excessive medical costs, constant car repairs, increasing rents or mortgages.

We were on SNAP and state healthcare for most of our lives until we had the chance to supposedly pull ourselves up by the bootstraps and take on massive student debt. We were less stressed out then than we are now. Mostly because we knew our kids would get the health care they needed. Now we can’t afford 80% of the prescribed therapies and the state won’t pay for the tools needed to help them because we ‘make too much’.

So no, I fully disagree with you assuming there will she a wealth gap. That’s some centrist democrat messaging if I ever heard it."

We managed to dig out only because of sheer luck.

For a large portion of this country it is the same. Too poor to move out of rural areas because there’s no jobs to build a fund with. Too poor to afford an education because your family was poor. The recession, companies may have recovered but the fabric of our society sure as hell didnt.

So I’m going to strongly disagree with you in that we’re not at that point yet. Couple all that with the people we have on the street because of no mental health care... it makes the ramifications of Black Tuesday a joke."

The GOP has done its damndest to deregulate anything and everything and there’s been plenty of cooperate Dems to blame as well.

Capitalism with an integrated social system well managed and regulated is what America will thrive under.

You can’t have just one of them. Not just capitalism. Not just social policies. They are two systems that need to be married together. It will literally make America great again.

We’ll be better educated because of better education from free college/ trade systems.

We’ll have better infrastructure from unionized trade deals.

We’ll all have housing because it’s a basic human right.

We’ll all have medical care because it’s a basic human right.

This means we have more jobs in trades and medical which we can quickly fill because we’ll have free education that EVERYONE can use whether they are poor OR rich!

And how do we pay for this? 

Easy! Medicare for all is cheaper than our current bloated system by several trillion dollars. The Koch brothers ran their own study on it and found the damning truth themselves.

We’ll also defund the military because the current contracts are mismanaged like hell and were in forever wars all over the place that we don’t need to be in. We protect our own soil and invest in better defenses and cyber training .. again more jobs from that free education system.

Anyone telling you this is a pipe dream or fairy tail is someone trying to make sure we have no equality and share of power and wealth.

The progressive movement is real and it’s not just sanders or warren. Together they are bringing something to the forefront that my generation has been trying to do since Occupy Wall Street.

But you need to have the right candidates first. And Biden won’t do that for them."
politics,ff4zdj8,t1_ff4yyr7,1579576125.0,What about it?
politics,ff4ii1n,t1_ff4hi4r,1579564423.0,"Right. Totally agree. But for some context, we were on food stamps, state health care, all while working low paying medical jobs with 3 kids(our last one ended up being special needs so I had to stay home) and going to school taking on massive student loan debt.

Because of those ‘welfare’ programs my wife was able to finish a masters degree and after another certification in 2 years we may go from making 80k(we made 32k before she got her masters) a year to making maybe 200k a year if everything pans out.

We had to take on 20k in medical debt even with premium health insurance. We’re filing for bankruptcy but will be able to keep our house due to state exemptions. It’s going to give us a restart button.

Establishment Dems might be marginally better but people like myself aren’t going to care about getting out to vote if they’re in the position we used to be in. Our lives were already miserable. If it GOP and establishment Dems are a difference between shit and not as shit, this demographic just doesn’t vote. Only if you come at them showing you’re taking them in your back and carrying them with you to a better life will they get on the ground and pound doors for you.

So yes there is some merit to ‘keep you asleep’ but there’s a lot of context missing as to why ‘progressives’ are a fickle voting bloc. It’s very simple. Candidates fighting for great change and a better overall life are candidates that win handedly. Time and time again.

Just wanted to give some insight in to how I viewed our situation and why I view establishment Dems the way I do. Yea they’re not as bad as the GOP, but are they going to make my shorty life better or keep it the same?"
politics,ff4gzlo,t1_ff4gd4c,1579563384.0,"No different than I tell my kids, you can mess things up for a long time but what’s important is to acknowledge when you are wrong, apologize, and do what you can to help fix the situation you helped cause.

In reality, thank Warren and Sanders for running campaigns that really speak to people like myself.

They’re who we need. Establishment Dems message certainly didn’t ‘wake’ me up."

politics,ff4ejma,t1_ff4djtl,1579561729.0,"This is what republicans tried to game out during the house meetings. They acted like a travesty had occurred when Nadler said they’d meet back the next day to vote in the light of day.

It’s obvious what’s happening.

We will remember this come the election. I voted republican for 25 years. I switched to democrat in 2018. 

Lots of reasons why, mostly I was raised in the south and getting out of that indoctrination is a feat itself.

There are thousands like me. The GOP can thank trump for that. He really lay bare what the GOP was really about for idiots like myself. They’re going to be shocked and awed when 2020 happens. They’re so out of touch they don’t know how bad it is yet.

My grandfather, before he passed, talked to me a bit about the Korean War he was sent to fight in. He never wanted to talk about it when he was healthy but when he was on his death bed he realized I’d never get answers to questions I’d asked him for years as a kid.

The right wing went further right and many of those people in power wanted to keep power so they shifted to the other party as they could retain their ‘moderate’ lane. 

The reality is we have close to 3 distinct parties right now. Right wing extremists, moderates, and progressives.

The problem with a progressive voter base is they do not show up if they don’t think a candidate is going to do anything to change. Why show up to vote if it’s just more of the same broken system? They should show up because they don’t want it to be even worse?

Reality check here for all the privileged internet keyboard warriors: those people are more concerned about their 2nd and 3rd shift jobs and where money for the next doctors bill or grocery bill is coming from.

You want to get those people out to vote? You put up a candidate that is going to make those peoples lives better and that party will win the vote. Every time we’ve had a vote on those grounds the progressive base has turned out in force and real change has been possible."
