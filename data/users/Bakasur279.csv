Art,ffbgdnn,t1_ff9fak5,1579764102.0,Thanks but I don't plan to. I rarely get time to play with paints.
Art,ff8zcf5,t1_ff8yboz,1579700808.0,"Thank you very much. And yes, made out of just coffee grounds and water for shades.

Actually, it's got a backstory. I forgot to bring a gift to my friend's birthday and was embarrassed. So, I told her to give me anything and I'll make her a gift out of it and some topic. She gave me coffee as a medium and book which she was reading currently named 'Siddhartha' by Herman Hesse for topic. Hence, the result.

I actually don't know if she will frame it or keep it somewhere else. Also, I've never sold any of my art till now and I just pursue it as a hobby, not my profession at all."

CasualConversation,ff2rs7o,t1_ff2o6i6,1579521269.0,Tbh they don't know much about me anyway. I keep them away from my personal life and avoid meeting them on weekends.
