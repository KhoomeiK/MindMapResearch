1. You did a nice thing. If, as your girlfriend says, you're gullible, then that's on you to accept an deal with.

2. I'm not sure if you made her stay, or she chose to stay. Either way, it's daytime and she's a big girl, she can walk on her own. You're in a relationship, not tied at the hip. (i.e. you like and do different things, this is a think you like, she doesn't, and she chose to stay.)

3. There is a great opportunity for you to sit down with her and find out why her reaction was as it was. Listen to get about germs, homeless men (another poster suggested they sexually harass women), and for you to put forward your feelings about doing nice (though potentially gullible) things."
