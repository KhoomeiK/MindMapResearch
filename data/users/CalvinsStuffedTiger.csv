Downsides of solar are clearly storage, and (in america) the Midwest and Northeast won’t get enough sun during the winter, so nuclear makes a lot of sense 

In the Southwest, you can generate all the power you need, batteries are still an issue but to a lesser degree since there is such an abundance of sunlight, but in the Southwest you need water to clean the panels and water is a scarce commodity in this area.  

I like wind too but same problems as solar with the storage

I think those things would do more than any of my crazy incentive strategies"

nursing,fehh9oz,t3_ep5x3b,1579116504.0,"Not alone, I too was faced with an existential dilemma where I was burnt to a crisp (figuratively), and found a job on the admin side which is way more chill and pays the same 

The dilemma i was facing is that if I’m constantly promoting leaving the bedside to my friends that are also really good at the bedside as I was, who is going to be left at the bedside.  Angry, cold, jaded nurses and new grads? 

If it gives you any hope at all, know that in my time writing blogs and podcasting I came across a nurse executive who rose to become the actual CEO of their hospital system and (according to her) made it her mission to take care of the nurses, as in making sure everyone is fully staffed, actually showing up on the unit to talk to nurses, (this next one was a big one) said when the shit hit the fan, she , the CEO , was not afraid to step in and start taking helping at the bedside doing lines and med red recs and shit.  (I know she lurks on this subreddit so shoutout to you if you’re reading this, you should publish some numbers)

Again, this is all here say so she could have been bullshitting me, but she said if you focus on nurse retention , then you don’t have to spend money on travelers or recruiting, and then you can hire more support staff which means nurses don’t waste their time doing other people’s jobs, which in turn retains more nurses, etc 

I mean this is all stuff we already know but it’s good knowing there are people actually trying this stuff out and succeeding 

I’m slowly working up the ranks in my organization and have been planting some seeds, but a few things I am certain will succeed if implemented are: 

We know from our data that there is a drop-off in people leaving the organization at 2 years and at 6 years and if they stay over 10 they basically stay forever. 

So i propose that we develop a scholarship program for support staff like OR Scrub Techs, CNAs, etc, where every x months/years, there is a process where the staff, managers, and doctors all nominate a support staff member and we pay for their nursing school.  The stipulation is that you have to have been an employee for 4 years (with recommendations from all of the above), and you work Sat/Sun + one day during the week while in school, and you sign a 4-year contract. 

This system will bridge the gap between the 2-6 years when everyone leaves the hospital, and has a contract that runs through the 10 year mark where they will stay forever.  We will also ensure that we get the best support staff in the city because people know that they can get free nursing school and dramatically increase their earning potential by working at our hospital.  

So Imagine if you had twice as many support staff as you do today and they were all comprised of the best CNAs you’ve ever had.  How much easier would your job be? 

John Muir in Walnut Creek also has a really cool program where if you create a program and can prove that it saves the hospital money, you get a bonus of 3-5% of the money you saved the hospital up to $10k. 

If we had that here I would have been paid more than the CEO probably lol. 

Last but not least once we actually get enough support staff and nursing staff that everyone isn’t being ran into the ground, then we can implement a bonus system where referring friends gets you paid more and more the longer they work here.

All of this sounds very pie in the sky and “expensive” but I’ve proven that the most expensive nursing related things we have are: hiring/training new nurses only to have them leave immediately, nurses that get hurt get put on modified or eat up a FTE on leave for 2 years, travel nurses, and hiring incentives.

All of those expenses can be diverted straight into nurse retention if we focus on not making the job suck ass so badly that people feel compelled to leave. It doesn’t require any additional money except for the first few years maybe."

Strategically sure, they are unexpected but if opponent is moving around most of the time it’s not really an issue 

An underrated strategy imo is southpaw vs orthodox, both fighters are trained to drift toward the lead hand side away from the straight punch or the roundhouse, so a technique in this situation is to throw spinning attacks to make the opponent think twice about drifting toward that side 

Conor Mcgregor when he isn’t busy sucker punching old people actually utilizes this strategy often in his fights.  He throws spinning back kicks and wheel kicks constantly to get the opponent to freeze along the cage then he throws his crazy long left hand and the fighters don’t have enough space behind them to back up and don’t realize how long mcgregor is and they get put down 

Watch the brandao fight, siver, Mendez, Alvarez, they all got put down with this exact setup.  Mcgregor throws the straight left at a “normal” distance just gauging the distance, getting the fighters used to that range, then he starts throwing push kicks and straight lefts to back them toward the cage, then he throws spinning attacks, and then BAM he lunges with a straight left and the opponent thinks they are at a safe distance but they get cracked.

I think the solution is honestly to blanket ban: political ads, pharmaceutical ads (this includes ads about vaccines and medications), religious ads, articles that promote violence against others, addictive consumables (products with sugar, caffeine, nicotine, alcohol) 

And that’s that.  If we say, “no fake news” well what does that even mean? Where’s the line? 20 years ago it would have been fake news to say high fat low carb diets are healthier than the food pyramid which emphasizes breads and grains as the bulk of the caloric intake.  Now we are almost certain this is true.  

To your point it’s not really fake news to say that there is a controversy.  There’s a controversy because people are retarded and can’t read, but the controversy still exists 

And where do you draw the line? To illustrate this point I think someone should post two ads.  One advertising the “is Mark Zuckerberg a robot?” Controversy and it’s just a pamphlet showing clips of him sipping water. HES NOT EVEN DRINKING IT, only a fucking robot sips water like that! 

And then another ad talking about the Holocaust denier controversy 

All three are absurd (except for the robot one which is probably true) and determining which one should be banned requires making a decision on ethics or morality.  

I think if we ban social media companies from advertising all of these things, then allow them if they declare they are a journalist organization which would make them accountable for spreading fake news, a lot of these problems will be solved

Though I will say as someone whose entire family works in medicine and have personally worked in multiple facets of the industry, I can say pretty confidently that universal healthcare is the best solution, BUT the other side has arguments that are fair. 

TL;DR healthcare arguments in the U.S. are very nuanced. 

The arguments pro-private healthcare people will make are that yes healthcare in America is way more expensive than anywhere else (they’ll leave out that the outcomes overall aren’t as good), the major breakthroughs in technology, medications, research, etc are mostly happening in the United States because so many people are able to get stupid rich off of said breakthroughs 

Also, nurses like me, doctors, etc, all get paid significantly more than our counterparts in countries with universal healthcare which is true (there have been doctor / nurse strikes over wages and working conditions in France, Germany, UK).  We have strikes here too but it’s not as bad, and definitely not very many (if any at all) doctor strikes over wages. 

My counter-argument is I’d happily get paid less for my job if it meant not having to worry about my family members going bankrupt over medical debt.  My amazing corporate health insurance only extends to my immediate family, so if my parents, or siblings,have some catastrophic illness...who do you think will foot that bill? 

The other major argument I have for pro-universal healthcare is that from an economics perspective demand for healthcare is in elastic, which means the demand for care isn’t coupled with price.  For example if you get in a car wreck and are bleeding out in the street, whether I charge you $5k, $10k, $20k, or $100k for the helicopter life flight out of there, you are going to pay it.  Same thing with life saving cures for rare illnesses.  With private healthcare and lax regulations, you will ALWAYS get price gouging.  There’s no way around it because people are horrible, and because of this reason alone I believe we necessarily have to shift toward universal healthcare

The counter-point pro-private healthcare advocates would make is that if all of healthcare is free, then there will be a lot of price gouging the government as there is no dis-incentive for spending as much money on someone’s healthcare as possible.  Vs. in a private world a patient with, say, stage 4 pancreatic cancer can balance the decision between spending $1 million trying to fight the cancer, or saving the money and dying at home. 

My final argument for universal healthcare and one that I’m surprised presidential candidates don’t talk about ad nauseum during debates are getting rid of insurance companies.  Literally no one has been like, “yeah I had a really good experience with my insurance company and getting my claims denied for x,y,z reason.  And don’t forget about that random PA on my case that’s an out of network provider, really enjoyed getting billed $15k for someone I didn’t know existed and who cared for me while I was unconscious and my family was out of the room.  God I love insurance companies”. 

I’m not sure if anyone will care or read this, but if these are the best arguments on both sides of the aisle, and if you are like me and believe that the only path forward is to get Universal Healthcare.  Vote for Bernie in the primaries and general election and try to convince white people in swing states to start voting out republicans because that’s literally the only thing stopping this transition from happening."

before threadripper it was hard to get something with a lot of cores in a consumer grade platform, so If you were running a bunch virtual machines you may run out of cores.  

One of the major downsides imho is noise.  Servers are SO LOUD it’s like a whiny jet engine, so unless you have a closet or garage with good airflow it will drive your family crazy.  For that reason I think the strategy for most home users that want to do self hosting + multiple VMs will be to go Threadripper + a bunch of GPUs.
