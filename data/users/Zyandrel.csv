Find yourself a girl that does not care and respect those who do. And don’t fucking manipulate people.

Also I don’t believe you.

Who the fuck cares if it is a selfie honestly. I see this advice repeated here *all the time* and I just don't get it. The gym thing too... It's a hobby, I like knowing about hobbies and frankly would want to be with a guy who is fairly active, that's really attractive.

You look really good, you have a nice smile in the third picture. Maybe just have one picture of closer to your face?"

I do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and my gym is definitely my safe space, I would not want to date anyone who goes there. It depends what kind if gym, maybe the OP and his date go to an MMA gym too."

Is there something in particular you would like to know? Like how to find housing or you want maybe things to do and food recommendations?

One thing I can think of is people in Montréal are very nice and it’s very multicultural and the vast majority of people speak English. But there are a few French-Canadians that don’t like to have to speak English to foreigners (Maybe you speak French?, they will roll their eyes and huff and puff don’t let them affect you."

Tinder,fc41a6y,t1_fc3mf6e,1577403998.0,I think pictures 6 and 8 are the best ones. But maybe it is because I like the little blase look to the side. Fitness pictures are nice because some of us girls are into it and it nice to have some things in common.

I joined a gym near me though that I really really love. So far as I know the gym owner also has kids but I don't know about others (there is mostly young guys). I don't think it would be appropriate to bring my son with me... I literally just joined so maybe when I know them better? But then there is also the problem of him never sitting still lol.

I donâ€™t know how I ended up here but Iâ€™m glad I found your comment."

Tinder,fe05wjx,t1_fdza820,1578803842.0,"Okay so first of all I donâ€™t care if you live at your momâ€™s appartement or she lives at your house (which one the fuck is it?) especially if it is not because you are a basement dweller.

Lie to me though, try to TRAP me (seriously dude what the FUCK?) Into liking you before saying something that is a dealbreaker to some people (deal with it!) and I will just walk the fuck away because you know what is a red flag? LIARS!

Find yourself a girl that does not care and respect those who do. And donâ€™t fucking manipulate people.

Also I donâ€™t believe you. 

You are definitely not as much as a catch as you think you are and I can tell youâ€™re already fucking lying. Stop blaming the girls and take a look at yourself."
Tinder,fe05fx3,t1_fdzw7th,1578803505.0,"Yep, sheâ€™s not interested."
AmItheAsshole,fdzg6ls,t1_fdxwk4k,1578789946.0,Honestly if my spouse drove drunk I would leave them. There is NO excuse and I would never respect them again.

reactiongifs,fdqnwro,t1_fdqn2h2,1578671082.0,"I agree with you :D Itâ€™s definitely a big step up from just texting.

Maybe itâ€™s because I have playing online games for almost 15 years now and used a LOT xD of voice chat that I feel this way.
But you can definitely get very close to someone by talking to them regularly with voice."
reactiongifs,fdqjgka,t1_fdqhxl0,1578668163.0,"I donâ€™t know who is the idiot who downvoted you is but youâ€™re right. I have been texting a guy I am interested in for a little over two months now, we havenâ€™t been able to meet yet but we have talked on the phone and also video call, and that definitely helped :)"
Tinder,fdomv1y,t1_fdomn0x,1578608376.0,One a day for a week is shitty still. 7-8 dates in any kind of short time is shitty.

Tinder,fdokekx,t1_fdmkk6h,1578606922.0,"I donâ€™t understand youâ€™re pretty cute, and you have a genuine bio that you actually talk about yourself (I would take out the open minded bit though, to me it always sounds weird)

Youâ€™re attractive honestly and you have nice pictures so I donâ€™t know why you have no matches."
Tinder,fdoi402,t1_fdmxvd9,1578605602.0,"Also female here, youâ€™re really really cute. I would just add more pictures, it kinda feels like three is the bare minimum.

I agree maybe something in the bio, like a thing or two about you so a girl has something to say when she matches with you."
Tinder,fdoco80,t1_fdo4naw,1578602752.0,"Not 7 or 8 in a fucking weekend asshole.

Even just two dates in one day is tacky as fuck."

Tinder,fddt3ua,t1_fdcx8hh,1578323290.0,I needed to hear that too actually. It's shitty to be rejected :(
Tinder,fda9nyk,t1_fda4y8y,1578243350.0,Why do you guys think crude jokes like that are funny? Theyâ€™re really not.
Tinder,fd50irw,t1_fd4vt35,1578172957.0,Ya definitely could do better. Itâ€™s not a good joke

Tinder,fd4g2vm,t1_fd2sous,1578167175.0,"I agree that you're definitely cute xD Someone already said the second pic works best as first and I agree, I think the updated version is good but I really liked th picture with the glasses actually, you look really cute on that one and if I was you I would make it the second or third picture."
Tinder,fd4drlm,t1_fd3n3eb,1578166679.0,"Your bio is fine too, not sure I understand the part about making an effort in a liberal way (?) My German is not that good xD  


The rest is fine, and makes you seem nice :)"
Tinder,fd4djmw,t1_fd42nwv,1578166615.0," I like to go to the gym, love to be in bed watching Netflix. I am fun with everyone and have nothing against spontaneity. I am a little crazy and often make an effort in a liberal way (?) but it pays off. Otherwise I love long nights spent laughing. 

I tried"
Tinder,fd4bfd5,t1_fd3n3eb,1578166076.0,"You're cute. And am I like the only girl who does not care about mirror or gym selfies or even selfies in general? Who the fuck cares if it is a selfie honestly. I see this advice repeated here *all the time* and I just don't get it. The gym thing too... It's a hobby, I like knowing about hobbies and frankly would want to be with a guy who is fairly active, that's really attractive.

You look really good, you have a nice smile in the third picture. Maybe just have one picture of closer to your face?"

You know actually, I care! Whatâ€™s something that you like about your culture? I am genuinely interested :)"

It is fucking insulting 

Do not do that"
Tinder,fcxjwj2,t1_fcxgbnr,1578064743.0,Iâ€™m a girl and I found them flattering. I still will only swipe right if the guy is attractive to me though.

Tinder,fcw6v5q,t1_fcvvg12,1578018508.0,"Is that true? Your last sentence?

Cause now am I little scared that is happening to me... I just thought maybe he isnâ€™t that interested but then again he seems really interested.

I donâ€™t know, your explanation about pen pals kinda makes sense :/ 

Iâ€™m sad now, I really like talking to him and I do want to meet him."
Tinder,fcozffg,t1_fcowt62,1577845860.0,"I donâ€™t think it takes the cake, I would react the same way she did.

I do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and my gym is definitely my safe space, I would not want to date anyone who goes there. It depends what kind if gym, maybe the OP and his date go to an MMA gym too."
bjj,fcnq944,t1_fclz1tk,1577816388.0,"I shall definitely try :D Thank you! 

Was it your first time in MontrÃ©al?"
bjj,fcnq26k,t1_fcmci0g,1577816288.0,"Oh that is so nice you are moving here :D Where are you coming from?

Is there something in particular you would like to know? Like how to find housing or you want maybe things to do and food recommendations?

One thing I can think of is people in MontrÃ©al are very nice and itâ€™s very multicultural and the vast majority of people speak English. But there are a few French-Canadians that donâ€™t like to have to speak English to foreigners (Maybe you speak French?, they will roll their eyes and huff and puff donâ€™t let them affect you."

You reply made me realize it has nothing to do with me. Iâ€™ll need to remember though"

Tinder,fcfhc8f,t1_fcedfum,1577629929.0,"Aaaah okay I see what you mean now.

Tinder,fc41a6y,t1_fc3mf6e,1577403998.0,I think pictures 6 and 8 are the best ones. But maybe it is because I like the little blase look to the side. Fitness pictures are nice because some of us girls are into it and it nice to have some things in common.

I joined a gym near me though that I really really love. So far as I know the gym owner also has kids but I don't know about others (there is mostly young guys). I don't think it would be appropriate to bring my son with me... I literally just joined so maybe when I know them better? But then there is also the problem of him never sitting still lol.  


They do offer a little monkeys BJJ for 3-4 year olds and I was thinking of trying that with him :D Maybe he will like it."
