espresso,ffe3run,t1_ffabxx6,1579835937.0,"For OP's relatively heavy use, I'd think the PID on the Classic would be almost a necessity to help get consistent shots. It is a great choice for a starter machine, though. I don't have experience with the Breville grinder, but I'd also recommend looking for a refurb or even a lightly used Sette 270wi to stay on budget. They do come up now and then-—I for mine on eBay and it was practically brand new."

A bit more info will help with recommendations. I'm sure the Hobby would be a fine choice, but depending on your needs, there might be other options for less money."

""In an interview with the Independent in 1990, months before his death, he described himself as antisemitic and railed against the “Jewish-owned” media.

He told the publication: “It began in 1982 when the Israelis invaded Lebanon. They killed 22,000 civilians when they bombed Beirut. It was very much hushed up in the newspapers because they are primarily Jewish-owned …

“I’m certainly anti-Israeli and I’ve become antisemitic in as much as that you get a Jewish person in another country like England strongly supporting Zionism. I think they should see both sides. It’s the same old thing: we all know about Jews and the rest of it. There aren’t any non-Jewish publishers anywhere, they control the media – jolly clever thing to do – that’s why the president of the United States has to sell all this stuff to Israel … ”
