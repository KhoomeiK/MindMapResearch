Trump is such a huge national security threat. I like E. Warrens proposals that if sheâ€™s elected, sheâ€™ll have her justice department have an entire unit devoted to rooting out ANY corruption that may have occurred under Trump.!!!"

And if he thinks you are really wanting to tell him something, he definitely set his jaw and not want to hear it. 
He is exhibits behaviors most people outgrow when theyâ€™re 10.

Trump is so ignorant he really thought it was a one and done like El Bagdadhi was. Iâ€™ve heard 3 times on CSPAN that this was almost the worst mistake he couldâ€™ve made. This will definitely define the next year. Itâ€™s bad because NO ONE really knows who convinced him to do this. 
At the end of December, Russia China and Iran conducted Naval exercises together for 4 days... Whatever thatâ€™s about,  itâ€™s not good.

It is most unfortunate that the folks teaching you new voters on how this all works, failed to tell you the #1 rule... if you donâ€™t vote because you didnâ€™t like who was on the ballot. Your EMPTY VOTE is a vote for whomever you liked the LEAST. 
Voting only works if you participate. Sometimes it seems like choosing the lesser of two evils. I DID NOT want to vote for Clinton either. But Iâ€™ve been voting for 40 years. Always been engaged in current events and politically aware. 
Donald Trump is the worst national security threat we have ever faced. Ever."

Mitch led the Senate and John Boehner was Speaker for the last 6 of Obamaâ€™s 8 years. They declared Obama a one term President and called themselves the party of NO. Itâ€™s not a stretch to say they were looking for whatever they couldâ€™ve found to impeach him. Or discredit Democrats however they could. They had full control! So if Joe Biden and  Hunter were so corrupt, why didnâ€™t the GOP take them out?!? 
The Democrats currently only have the House and weâ€™re running roughshod over Trump.
