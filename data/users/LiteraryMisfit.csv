Trump has fucked up a lot of foreign policy but he undoubtedly hit the Iran incident square on the head. He waited to kill Soleimani until it was patently obvious to everyone that he was evil incarnate, then made it clear to Iran that if they kept misbehaving, he'd send swarms of drones until they were dictators of a parking lot-BUT he was willing to let them off the hook if they didn't throw too much of a tantrum. Crude, but effective.

> If a US general interfered in Iran, resulting in the deaths of Iranian citizens, would you see Iran as being justified in killing him or her unilaterally? I imagine you would not.  

Are you sure you wrote what you meant to say? I'm a little confused. See, the thing is, if a US general was over in Iran engaging in terrorist attacks and killing unarmed civilians, then yes, Iran would be justified in killing him or her. I'd welcome that, though I'd wager we'd get to that general first. But that's essentially the situation, except Soleimani wasn't an American general. He was an Iranian military leader and member of the government who killed civilians and non-combatants in Iran and elsewhere.

Whereas in contrast, with Iran, the US took out a bad guy, and Iran was so scared that they purposely missed when retaliating via missile, and then signaled that they were prepared to let bygones be bygones as long as the US let them be.

Indeed, which was a gross and disgusting restriction on the rights of Americans (even though luckily that wording didn't make it into the amendment.) Gun control has always been rooted in the oppression of subjugation of minority individuals. The first 'modern' gun control laws were passed in order to disarm the Black Panthers, for example. 

As for the Supreme Court, I'm just going to repeat what I said to another person commenting because I'm tired.

> Just as the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of slavery, school segregation, and second-class status for various groups of Americans in the past. Eventually, they rectified their mistakes and now in hindsight we look back on those instances as disgusting examples of American tyranny. Just as we will look back on gun control laws approved by the Court one day. The Amendment itself is very clear; if it imposes any restrictions, it would be that all able-bodied Americans of military age are supposed to be regularly training in a militia. Absolutely no where does it say anything about restricting actual firearms rights. You can't just add stuff to an amendment and then pretend it 'allows' something. If you want it to read a different way, amend it. In the meantime, all gun control laws are technically illegal.

Essentially, just because something is on the books or a 'law' doesn't mean it's right, or even morally tolerable."

I usually just sear it with the copious amounts of butter splattering up and cooking the outside, so it's the same principle. I didn't even think I was doing things the proper way, I just had a piece of raw meat, a skillet, and an appetite and now I don't even go to steakhouses anymore."

politics,ffbhdnp,t1_ffahaqx,1579765375.0,"I should have been more clear; I'm aware that these laws will likely go on the books and that's that. But just because a law is a law does not mean it is morally right, or even valid. The Constitution is the highest law in the land-everything else defers to it. Therefore, it's simply a fact that gun control laws are 100% illegal, and as a result are not legitimate. 


This has historical parallels-people helping escaped slaves in pre-Civil War America, people hiding Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe, people watching airdropped Hollywood movies in North Korea, civil disobedience during the Civil Rights movement, and so on. In fact, you could argue it's the civic duty of liberty-minded people everywhere to ignore/subvert such laws."

Your points are completely valid. I never said that there weren't huge institutional obstacles and outright persecution in the past that adversely affected some races more than others. I was simply stating that perhaps it's time to move past the divisiveness, because it's done nothing but increase tensions in this country for the past 25 years."
