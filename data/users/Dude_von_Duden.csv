AskReddit,ffdehcz,t1_ffddj3r,1579819174.0,"You should get a full psychiatric examination. Not just for something your councelor thinks you have. Also it might not be psychological. Various brain issues (physical damage, brain tumor etc.) can cause hallucinations. If nothing helps, you should visit a neurologist asap. I don't know your exact situation, but please do not underestimates this."
AskReddit,ffdd6zi,t3_et0e8k,1579818401.0,"I don't, but a friend of mine does. When he was a teenager he started hearing sound and voices that weren't there. For example, he was on a school trip, went to take a piss at night and heard his mother speaking to him. It sounded so uncomfortable the way he told me. His life is also like roller coaster, but that might be the depression as well. He's fine most of the time when he takes meds, but can get really weird without them. I don't mean it in a bad way, his mind must be going through hell, but he can really creep/scare the shit out of me sometimes. He's quiet for a while and then screams something completely out of context. Ubfortunately he also suffers from mental breakdowns. He's perfectly fine for a few months, find a girlfriend etc. Everything seems fine and then he just crashes, like a car against invisible wall and he ends up in a psychiatric hospital for a few weeks. Overall, I'd say it's like your brain is trying to trick you with voices, sound, sometimes even visions that seem 100% real, it is happening to you and it's so difficult to tell, you need help."

My point is, we´re not just walking brains. We are the whole thing. The hair, the scars, the short legs that made you so insecure, the muscles that made you so proud, your genitalia and where they lead you in life lol. Sure the brain might pull the strings, but the puppeteer is so much more imo."
