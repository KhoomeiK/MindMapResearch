Eucalyptus has evolved to help spread wildfires if they are unhealthy so the fire burns hotter and goes farther to help remove competing plants so the eucalyptus has a better chance on succeeding generations.

The \*only\* thing out of the ordinary is just how widespread and severe they are.  This is because  

1: Climate change, yeah you know, things dry as fuck.  

2: The bigger problem is that people(everywhere, not just Australia) do not allow the healthy, small, bush fires to occur as they used to.  We obviously don't want our homes to burn down but those frequent small fires allow fuel to be eaten up little by little.  When we fuck this process up we effectively end up with TONNES.  This fuel burns extra hot and is close enough to other fuel areas to ignite them as well.  (or you know, in Australia's case, you can also get windblown embers once a bush fire burns hot enough)"
