I realized at the 3-month mark that I had feelings for her. 

I told her. She said she wasn't looking for anything serious. And even if she was, I was only living in Lyon for a year, so it wouldn't go anywhere anyway. (I would literally consider moving to Lyon for her). 

I told her it wasn't going to be a good idea for me to see her anymore. 

She texted me the next day like we never had the conversation.  So I dropped it and try to just... stay fuck buddies.

It was going just ok for another 3 months.. then she asks me if I was interested in joining her and her friend (female) for a threesome. FB is bisexual so she's cool with it. 

We did it, and it was fun.. but weird. After that, for a couple of weeks... she kept talking about her.. on.. and on.. and on.. it was making me pretty mad.. I wish I didn't do it tbh.. seeing her fuck another girl.

Then she mentioned a threesome with another dude and I just got really mad.  Honestly I'd probably get mad even if it was another girl. She asked me why I was being such an asshole. I told her that I still had really strong feelings for her and wanted a relationship. 

Her reply to my entire speech was, ""don't"".

So I told her I was done with her. 

Again, she started texting me like that conversation never happened. 

I told her she needed to stop.
