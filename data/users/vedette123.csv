pilates,fcxur75,t1_fcxsa3k,1578070699.0,You're welcome! I provided a detailed explanation of the issues with CP in response to another commenter's thread below.
pilates,fcxuf71,t1_fcxsc8n,1578070645.0,"I would not recommend CP for a number of reasons: first, my experience in any class varied widely depending on the instructor. Some classes I wouldn't even break a sweat whereas in others, I'd be drenched in it, some did a lot of yoga moves, and others did a log of work with weights. I started to wonder if there was actually a method involved or if my experience depended entirely on whoever happened to be leading the class that day.

Second, there is very little individual instruction. The purpose of pilates as I understand it is to produce proper alignment and correct issues that arise from poor posture and movement. This requires a high degree of one-on-one attention between the instructor and student, which can be impossible in a 12-person class where everyone is pumping away. I definitely built muscle while doing club pilates, but my poor form went uncorrected for a year, leading me to develop a problem with my hip. I'm 31 and very thin (5'6"" and 105 lbs). This would not have happened had I been using my body correctly. 

Finally, Club Pilates is a franchise that employs many people. Strange charges showed up on my credit card that their new employees denied. They were also unresponsive to questions I would ask. 

Club Pilates is cheaper than classical studios but still expensive. I paid $280 a month essentially to be able to use reformers without learning how to use my body. What I plan to do from here is join a classical pilates studio and take either mat classes or a month of reformer classes until mastering all the moves with confidence. If I don't continue with my studio, I will join the much recommended pilatesology membership that is loved in this community."
