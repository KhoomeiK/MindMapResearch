AskUK,ff4sv8p,t3_erhj69,1579571636.0,"I had a twatty Manager and had to have a Hysterectomy at the age of 38. He tried to force me to come back to work after only 6 weeks off despite me having complications. Anyway, I demanded to speak to the company Doctor about the various intimate details as my boss was such a twat and he was not qualified to make any medical judgments. You don’t need to go into the gory details. Flash the letter under his nose to prove where you’re going and when. You are allowed to have paid leave for hospital appointments. If he wants the details tell him it’s personal & to mind his business (nicely) is there some sort of Company helpline you can contact apart from HR. The thing is, if you need any further procedures doing after, the last thing you need is to be stressing over this plonker."
