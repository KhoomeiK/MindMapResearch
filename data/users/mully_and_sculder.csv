Im strongly against devolving power to the feds, and i dont agree that a majority of people want this either.  The federal government whoever is in power, is terrible at front line service delivery, has proven itself to be relentlessly corrupt, and the competing sovereignty of the states is what makes federalism strong.  Wed be much better off if states could levy more direct taxes and had their industrial relations powers back."
