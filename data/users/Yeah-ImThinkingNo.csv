todayilearned,fenywam,t1_fenhvpb,1579292834.0,"Nothing that intense but I used to smoke weed and one time (it was potentially laced with something?) the vibrancy of the colors looked like they were coming out of people's mouths as they said words and things on the walls started changing to their word-color as I noticed them. It was like living in a surrealist painting. I hated it.

Edited: missed opportunity for me to say nothing other than ""refer to my username"" but the story seemed worth telling."
todayilearned,fenxl1u,t1_fenmk8f,1579292308.0,"I found out freshman year of college. I was highlighting my textbooks and getting frazzled about organization when I was trying to explain to a friend in my class why I cared about certain words being certain colors and they thought I was high. Someone overheard and said he had synesthesia too, that he gets it. I said something like ""I don't have a disease, I'm just overwhelmed!"" but he explained it later. 

 I have the racetrack thing for months of the year too but the spatial stuff is far less developed for me. I might be wrong but I think there tends to be crossover for most of us. I've met others through studies who have wildly complex versions where they can't eat certain food or say certain words because of the associations."
todayilearned,fenebwm,t1_fen94w6,1579282860.0,"It's never bothered me. I have always been really good at word searches so obviously that makes it entirely positive.. If colors are ""wrong"" I see the color they're printed in first until I focus up. It only effects me negatively when I'm trying to read colored letters out loud - I'll jumble up my speech a lot. This happens mostly when I'm reading kids books to my children.

It helps me remember plans without a reminder because I associate the appointment/activity with the color of each day. I can recall ""oh, it was a Tuesday"" without actively thinking about it (because that's like a specific sunset gradient color) and it's just attached to the thing I'm remembering. 

Typing it, I realize it sounds a little bonkers, but it's hard to explain."

 Sometimes if a lot of the same letters in a word are similar, like red/orange letters are together, then the whole word looks a shade of red/orange. Think of it like how you can see heat on a hot black road. It just sort of radiates that color. If I'm not focusing on the letter or word, it's not like it holds the color when I'm out of focus like those kids alphabet magnets."
