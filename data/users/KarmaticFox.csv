AskReddit,ff1sofs,t3_er59yq,1579485308.0,"Anything sexual for no reason other than the fact that I'm a female usually makes the most ""disturbing/weird"" lists.

The most recent has been happening in WOW. I'm camping (on and off), for a rare mount and there is this player who won't get the hint. He follows me when I'm in the area and says vulgar things such as ""I just farted and it smells like you."", to follow up with ""Licks you, flirts with you."".

He may say something innocent before reverting back to his inappropriate behavior.

On the first day (this was 5 days ago), he did what I mentioned above for over 45 minutes before logging off. Then he came back around 6 hours later and started again. Mind you, I ignored him and acted like he wasn't there. I never said a word to him.

In the end, I decided to not block him so I could get plenty of screencaps to send to a GM in a very detailed ticket. I got a reply from a GM saying that it was concerning and that they would look into it.

Shortly after the GM replied to my ticket, the player logged off.

Last night he showed up again. He claimed that he missed me, called me his ""friend"", and continued on with the toxic behavior. I reported him again and added him to my block list. I'm fairly certain he will use an alt or just follow me around. He has done this with other players in the area, but seems to have a weird fixation on me. At this point, I don't think he is a troll. I think he's socially inept.

Other not so recent disturbing things include people who wanted me to engage in ""private chats"", after hearing my voice or figuring out that I am a female if I don't bother talking to them. These people will then promise to buy me games, DLCs, and even game accessories if I get sexual with them over the mic or via social media.

This happens so much that people think I'm lying out of my ass. My own husband didn't even believe me until I had him sit down and listen to what is said to me during in-game chats in a 2 hour period. He wasn't shocked by what he heard. He was more shocked at how often it happened during this 2 hour period.

And that is why I don't interact with players who are not close friends/family and why I usually keep most in game chats turned off. In my experience, it's not worth the B.S."

For example; Back when Myspace was real big, I had two accounts. One was my main and the other was an account I set up to do RP with a few online friends that I had met on some forum site. The RP account blew up and I used it more than my main. I made the mistake of leaving the RP account open when I had family over and yeah... RIP.

- How did you meet these people?
- Why are you private messaging this person?

- You really like [insert fandom here]? I didn't know that.

- Oh God, you like [insert fandom here] too. 
- Why?
- That's so stupid. Can I add this account?

He's also a sore loser to the point of making excuses, calling his opponent cheap and in the case of video games will ""ban"" certain weapons, characters, and maps being used.

Anyway...

Most times it's cool. I get my food and go or maybe I chat up the staff for a quick moment.

Other times it's annoying because they can pick up on my eating habits and feel the need to comment on it. It's interesting since the ones that do this to me are usually health nuts or just happen to be on the heavy side.

Here are some quick stories...

Cafeteria 1 - If they weren't selling anything that I wanted, then I went to the deli and ordered a tuna sandwich/wrap with chips, fruit or something sweet. When the staff noticed it was cool because they knew exactly how to make my food, but once in a while they seemed annoyed in the way they would say ""Tuna sandwich?"". I remember one particular time where one of the girls at the deli asked me what I wanted and her coworker rolled his eyes and said: ""You know she's gonna want tuna."". I stopped going to them shortly after that.

Cafeteria 2 - They have these delicious M&M and chocolate chip cookies that is literally the only reason why I stop by. One cashier, in particular, noticed that I stopped by only for them. He went out of his way one day to say ""Again? I don't know how you do it."". Sometimes he'll say ""Cookie?"" or ""Cookie again?"", and shake his head. I don't bother buying anything if this guy is at the register.

Cafeteria 3 - They are by far the coolest. They love striking quick conversations while preparing the food. A few of them already know what I'll want, but still, ask me just in case. Recently, one of the workers has noticed that sometimes I'll get inventive and combine certain foods together into it's own meal. She'll try it out for herself and come up to me, later on, to tell me that she enjoyed the food."
