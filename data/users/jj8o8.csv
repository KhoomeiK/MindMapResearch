AskMen,ffcx5rq,t3_esruuu,1579809117.0,I never take it off. I have a 2nd ring my wife gave me before we married and that one doesnt come off either.
politics,ff76iir,t1_ff73v0f,1579642088.0,"Nope, this is the fault of the Democratic party for backing her when he was the clear choice. This is the fault of the Republican party for backing that ""person"". I didn't owe her my vote in any way, shape or form."
politics,ff73qnu,t3_erxx8y,1579640519.0,"Because of her I voted for the Green Party last election. I absolutely could NOT support her and there was no way in hell I was going to vote for ""He that shall not me named""."

ShamelesslyStolen,ff3f4yg,t3_erd33o,1579539795.0,"Left out a lot of parts. Like the shaping of the handle, the polishing of the head, and much more I bet. Cant stand gifs like that."
HistoryMemes,ff39y7q,t1_ff3853a,1579537121.0,"Oh I didnt and still dont understand it either but I believe her and accept it. In my experience people (throughout the world not just in the US) pick and choose what they want to accept or believe in their particular religious texts to support their world view and/or prejudices.

I grew up in North Augusta, SC and have seen and experienced a lot of things that were deemed acceptable just because it fit someone's interpretation of a particular religious text. Saw even more of it during my 20 yrs of service in the US Navy when visiting and travelling to and through other countries. Especially in the Middle East."
HistoryMemes,ff37auq,t1_ff36u1q,1579535395.0,From what I have been told the teacher thought that writing with the left hand was somehow connected to the Devil. Yay religion! She doesn't like to talk about it so I cant really pry too much. This was in NC in the mid to late 70's. She says she told her dad but he never did a thing about it. He was a Pastor back in those days so I guess he agreed or didn't care.  Again...Yay religion!
godtiersuperpowers,ff30b27,t1_ff2v6qd,1579530218.0,Sleeping when he/she sleeps is key. I have 3 kids and this little rule will save your lives. Or if y'all can swing it alternate sleeping while the other cleans/gets things done.
HistoryMemes,ff2yycs,t3_erbexz,1579529074.0,"My wife started off life left handed but during school she was forced to learn to write with he right hand. By ""forced"" I mean physically and mentally punished if she wrote or did anything left handed."

science,fe8pjtr,t1_fe7ukh3,1578928922.0,Why not both? Heat loss reduction from insulation and heat exchangers will never reach 100% so why not use the left over to generate electricity.

Eyebleach,fdqpz2u,t3_emk7yx,1578672378.0,I cover by doggo up with her blanket and she always squirms out of it. So cute!
aww,fdqedhv,t1_fdq6wvh,1578664477.0,"Kids just cry sometimes for no reason at all. They are still learning to deal with their emotions and some things just get the better of them. It could have been a temper tantrum or even crying cause she wanted something that she shouldn't or couldn't have for all we know. The person filming probably knew why the girl was crying and knew that it wasn't anything critical or world ending hence the filming. The dog just knew someone in the ""family"" was in distress and responded accordingly. 

We only have what we see in the video and shouldn't make snap judgments on such little information."

nosleep,fculjo7,t3_eikb1e,1577983648.0,I am so glad that my older vehicle has minimal computer controls. I'm just old enough that I learned how to live without computer support. I am an IT by trade but computers are still minimized  to pure support and entertainment roles in my house.

dndmemes,fcimt9r,t1_fcikc32,1577665193.0,"Seriously? A ""wizard"" is able to totally disregard the law of mass conservation (and probably many more laws) by being able to ""shrink"" cannonballs down to the size and weight of musket balls but you are having issues with the firing of said musket balls from the musket with a normal load of gunpowder?"
dndmemes,fcilvcc,t3_eh99fe,1577664741.0,Came to this thread expecting to see people using physics as reasons why this wouldn't work in a game where just about every spell violates some known law. Wasn't disappointed.
AbandonedPorn,fbesdon,t3_ecum5n,1576792814.0,I would so be taking all those books. There might be some great literature in there.
