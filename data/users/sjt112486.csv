worldnews,fdiljez,t1_fdikocw,1578445592.0,"‚ÄúOver 6,900 US service members and over 7,800 contractors have died in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

An unusually high percentage of young veterans have died since returning home, many as a result of drug overdoses, vehicle crashes, or suicide.

Coalition partners have died in large numbers: approximately 110,000 uniformed Afghans, Iraqis and other allies have died as of November 2018.‚Äù

2,977 died on 9/11.... so, no longer true. 

The coalition partner deaths is pretty staggering and sad."

Let‚Äôs say your target you are throwing at is a bullseye. You throw 3 darts and they all hit triple 6. This is an example of precision (all darts hit the same spot!) but not accurate (you missed your target!). 

On the contrary, let‚Äôs say your are aiming for 20. First dart hits the very top of the 20, the second hits the very lowest point of the 20, and the third hits the 20 somewhere near the triple 20. This is an example of accurate (you hit all 20‚Äôs!) but not precise (they were still scattered all over the 20 and not grouped together!)

When running tests or experiments you want those darts to be right at your target and grouped very tightly together. Hope this helps clarify!"
