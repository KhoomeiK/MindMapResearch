AskReddit,ffckpl7,t1_ffbt8mc,1579801522.0,"If you’re unsure of where to start looking, I highly recommend you browse and try out any of your city/county (usually it’s the city you reside in) community classes. They’re usually one day a week, generally in the evenings, and are an inexpensive way to branch out and learn new skills.

Note that this is different from junior college (community college), but the idea is the same. And often, if you want to go down the road of education for a career switch, taking a city recreational and continuing education class can help you in that endeavor. I.e.: interested in learning Microsoft Suites? Take a inexpensive class via your city, then if you really liked it, pursue it in junior college and it could turn into a career change for you."

AskReddit,ffad9kj,t1_ff9p7d6,1579732826.0,"I see and understand your view, but I have to ask one thing: do most guys assume that if they’re hanging out with a woman in her sweats and t-shirt, with hair not obviously in a time consuming style that she must be comfortable enough around then to not be all primped up? Aaaaand not just because maybe that’s what she prefers to wear as opposed to other women who prefer to look their nines?

I can attest that I genuinely enjoy wearing comfortable sweats and joggers with an unremarkable t-shirt, and my hair in a low-effort ponytail regardless of the situation when I’m hanging out with friends (in general). Unless, of course, we’re planning a safari outing into the wilds of Jumanji—then I’m going prepared ;P

Edit: style*, not side xo"

tifu,ff86ro7,t3_es489q,1579667589.0,"I’m so, so sorry to learn about how upset you are in your marriage. You don’t deserve this, and I hope you decide to take action for yourself and your welfare that best supports you.

On that note...should you go a legal route, make sure that if you consider a legal separation or divorce—which may be the healthiest option for your mental, physical and spiritual wellbeing, that you seek out *good* legal counseling or any organization that can help you navigate the process of legal separations. Especially on what to expect. 

Depending on which state you’re in, you could be tied up hard in settlement since the courts have a bad habit of favoring children with their mothers, and spousal alimony for women (harsh truth, unfortunately). I’d hate to see you lose everything to her.

Secondly, if I’m not mistaken, marriage is a vow by both parties that have obligations they willingly acknowledge and, well, vow to uphold right? Sounds to me like you’ve been doing your end well to meet her needs when she wants them met—and her? Not so much for your needs (I assume she’s been an attentive mother to your children). But anyway, I bring this up because I can only see this as valuable material for settlement agreements during any proceedings—if she’s not upholding what she’s promised you as a dutiful spouse (supportive etc.) then you e got a right to seek separation. 

Good luck to you.

Edit: wanted to add this—lots of well made points in the comments (my deepest sympathies to you all who’ve had to grow up in a difficult family situation, you have my support and I hope you’re all better off now) *and* I don’t want to see you eaten alive in the process for everything (money, assets, etc.) by her. Prep carefully and be careful. Also, protection (unless you also want more children, which is totally your prerogative)."
