Also, wasn't Big Bang kind of ""western"" and they were the biggest group in kpop? Wasn't kpop rooted in and very influenced by a kind of ""western"" tone, in that it borrowed the hip hop look and sound, while adding something new and different? What exactly  is ""western"" sound?

I felt like you are feeling now once, when I was going to university, and I dropped out in my 3rd year due to depression. I really want you to hear me out here.

For the rest of your life, you will have this prize that no one can ever take away from you. Your degree. It will guarantee you a better chance in life, a rewarding career. You can make friends later.
