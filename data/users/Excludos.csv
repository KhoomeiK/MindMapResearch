And your assumption is wrong. This keeper got a simple cramp after sprinting and diving for the ball 20 minutes into overtime. It's a completely reasonable thing to happen, as it happened to several players from both sides during that match, and if you've ever gotten proper leg cramps, you know that they hurt like hell.  


The truth is faking injuries it doesn't happen more in soccer than any other sport on the planet. It's just that a lot of people are playing it, and it tends to get highlighted when it happens. It speaks volumes of the general ignorance of the Reddit community if unsportsmanlike behaviour like picking up an injured player is met with cheers."

Singling out soccer is unreasonable because it doesn't happen more often than other places, it's just that you see a lot more of it because a lot of people play it, and it tends to get highlighted. What you don't see as often (but also regularly happens) is refs who see through it and either tells them to stop, or cards them.

In this particular example, the keeper got a cramp after sprinting and diving for the ball, 20 minutes into overtime. People from both teams were cramping left and right during that match, and it's a completely reasonable thing to happen at that point. What's not reasonable is to pick up an injured player and shove him over like he's trash for it."

I don't care what religion you might or might not have, you are to treat your fellow humans, and especially your children, with respect. I believe Jesus said something similar, but who cares about that part anyways..?"
