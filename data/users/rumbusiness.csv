I've already convinced them that the late 90s indie compilation 'Ladykillers' is the best album in the world."
MorbidReality,fgn0uw3,t1_fgmyn2r,1580935545.0,Is it the wine and popcorn or the puking that you wanted to join in with? Either way is fine

MorbidReality,fgmrxlf,t1_fgmosbe,1580930823.0,Me too. Was watching this while eating popcorn and drinking wine and now feel like I might actually throw up.
TwoXSex,fgmrkt8,t1_fgmr3ag,1580930617.0,But that's not what women say. Not even in this thread. Communicating with your partner is better than thinking you can try a 'trick' to get her body to 'perform' in a way it doesn't naturally.
MNTrolls,fgmqtbw,t1_fgmqht3,1580930173.0,It's a revelation to me because (pre-2018) I always lived in shoeboxes before (for 20+ years). This is the first time I've ever lived anywhere that could even potentially look nice. I do love my house even though it's falling to bits.
TwoXSex,fgmqo4h,t1_fgmppwf,1580930090.0,Why is it even a plus though?
TwoXSex,fgmqjre,t1_fglyyps,1580930019.0,I don't think any women ever label a man 'a great lover'.

About to make a rum and coke. My house is lovely and clean because we had guests and I'm still revelling in the tidy empty illusion."
MNTrolls,fgmq2ul,t1_fgmn0vl,1580929748.0,Hot water. Honey/sugar. Fresh lemon juice and lemon wedge. Fucking loads of whisky.

weddingshaming,fglenn9,t1_fgka4ke,1580893825.0,"Of course you can. But I hate it when people pretend that they're asking for gifts as a favour to other people. Just be honest and say you want to be given things,  don't try to dress it up as altruism (not you, the previous poster that I replied to).

Food bank instead of favours is a great idea."
fatlogic,fgleiju,t1_fgkij2n,1580893618.0,I'm usually on the normal side of the line between underweight and healthy BMI. I was referred for treatment here but what's on offer (NHS) is an absolute joke. A friend of mine did the same programme and said it was actively unhelpful and made her worse.

AskWomenOver30,fgjqq9w,t1_fgj414n,1580849532.0,"Yup. I'm 39. Last year a teenage boy shouted at me in a park that I ""looked sexy in my gym gear"" (I was walking home from the gym). I shouted back that I was old enough to be his mother.

fatlogic,fgjpbmq,t1_fgitnjw,1580848726.0,"That's scary. I'm the same height as you and weigh 126 at the moment and I feel huge. When I was actually anorexic I weighed just over 100 lbs and that did look thin. (and even that was way higher than many anorexics)

I like the way I feel between 110-120, and I get there most summers, but it's a struggle to stay there."
fatlogic,fgjp5qd,t1_fgj6req,1580848631.0,Yep. I'm 126 lbs at 5'8 and I fucking feel it when I gain or lose three pounds. I feel great at 118. HUGE at 130.

\> The phrasing could be tacky, but there's functionally no difference between ""I'm getting married, buy me towels so I can use MY money for something else I want"" and ""Give me money to do what I want or pay for the thing I actually want."" 

There is, however, a HUGE functional difference between either of those and ""no thank you, we don't want anything."""

You wanted to get people to buy you expensive stuff; at least own it."
weddingshaming,fgjh8yg,t1_fgiu7v1,1580844002.0,"We did the same, mutatis mutandis (not religious). It was a legal formality as far as I was concerned, not an opportunity to screech LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME for a day."
weddingshaming,fgjh5nk,t1_fgj5aqp,1580843948.0,Respect. I have said the same to my husband about any form of surprise party. Fortunately he feels exactly the same way.
weddingshaming,fgjgzr6,t1_fgixbqc,1580843850.0,Who cares what they say? We had a registry office marriage without guests and were back in work/at home with the kids by 2pm. We had two brilliant holidays that year.
weddingshaming,fgjgx04,t1_fgj6ctv,1580843804.0,"> These couples out there are spending like a year organizing an experience for y'all to enjoy, prepare food, keep your preferences in mind, seat you with people you like etc.

Nope. They're spending a year (and then some) organising a giant celebration of themselves and the fact that they've managed to get someone to agree to be legally obliged to have sex with them for the foreseeable."

I have kids, am married, and have three degrees. I've never had a birthday party, engagement party, wedding party, baby shower, or attended a graduation. 

I think that it's more about what kind of person you are, rather than whether or not you've done these specific things. You can go through the life events without choosing to engage in the narcissistic attention-seeking money-grabbing ego-fests."
