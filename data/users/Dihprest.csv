alcoholicsanonymous,ff4fuln,t1_ff4eou0,1579562605.0,"I need to seek a AA 

I need to before the grip gets tighter than it already is."
depression,fekolht,t1_fe4g3s5,1579204381.0,Thanks I read it all and I will try
prozac,fdqje7f,t1_fdntkhy,1578668118.0,Cocaine and prozac is good
prozac,fdqj39e,t3_emkwzy,1578667910.0,"I wouldn't worry about smoking weed and using prozac. I drink alcohol quite often on prozac and I'm on 40mg. 

I've experienced the chemical burp and yes it's horrific. Try drinking a glass of water with your pill so it goes right into your stomach and dissolves quickly.

I've had stomach cramps too, first 3 weeks off using prozac. It surpasses soon."
prozac,fdqiw70,t3_emi83n,1578667774.0,I use to take it before sleep and I use to suffer with insomnia. Try switching to mornings. It helped me.
depression,fdd96td,t3_ekl0zq,1578300640.0,"I wish I agreed but I dont. I cant get lost in music like i use to and have a song on repeat. It's like I've dried out every music genre. I love music in general a big fan of the older stuff. But I just cant get wildly lost like I use too. Hopefully it comes back to me one day.

I was watching a movie and at the end this song came on the credits, films called 'Wild'

Sometimes you gotta sit through a 2 hour movie to find a gem."
depression,fdd92ao,t3_eklvc2,1578300460.0,School was shite for me too. Having to deal with people. That's a problem for me too. Having to listen to the shit that comes out of some people's mouth is so degrading and tiring.
depression,fdd8yby,t3_ekl4wl,1578300301.0,Sometimes I have vivid dreams of dying. The last dream I had someone stabbed me in the side and I slowly bled out. It felt so real.
depression,fdd8wpu,t3_ekfp0m,1578300236.0,Yeah I spend way more time than I should in neverland. But it's a escape and it's not the worst strategy I use either.

TopsAndBottoms,fcny88r,t1_fcny2u6,1577820754.0,You'll recover. Herpes is curable. But make it a lesson. Hopefully you will find someone in 2020.
