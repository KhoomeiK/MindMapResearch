The whole thing is made of iron, with the thinnest layer of zinc to protect it from the weather. Patrolled continuously, constantly monitored for signs of a breach, it looms over the land behind it.

Captain Arnmundr Einarsson touches the tattoo on his wrist as he looked at the gate. An intricately detailed outline of a feather, only a third of the barbs were coloured. Each barb a kill, one day it would hopefully match the one on his other wrist.

He touches the bare blade of his knife as he thought of _Them_. Monstrous creatures from another world, they'd poured through portals over a decade ago. Every corner of the Earth had been affected, but the worst attacks came where belief in _Them_ had persisted. Where the old tales had still been told.

He had been just a child then. He'd fled on his father's fishing boat, him and his sister and his father's dead body floating in the sea until picked up by the British Royal Navy.

Arnmundr had vowed vengeance, and when offered a place on Operation Verja he had jumped at the opportunity. Joining the fleet that patrolled his childhood home's coast, he'd watched as the giant fence was constructed, and killed to defend its builders.

Other nations had caged their portals, wrapping them in iron to stop _Them_ from crossing over. But that wasn't possible here. The portals were too numerous, the enemy too many. So the entire island had been encircled in iron and fire, with a gate to allow small recon vessels through.

One day, Arnmundr hoped, they'd be able to reclaim his home. One day, he hoped, Iceland would belong to humans again.

An advantage because it means that most trails are easily accessible to a large portion of the population. Even as a non-driver I can access quite a few decent ones (although being on the edge of the Peak District gives me a leg up there). A disadvantage because so many people have easy access, and therefore can get out onto the trails without having to learn _how_ to share them with other users. Or, for that matter, use them safely, much to the annoyance of Mountain Rescue.

I've called ""on your left"" before and had people panic and move into that space, or split up so I'm forced to run between them (something I dislike doing). Others just turn immobile, forcing me to go off the path if I want to go around. Dogwalkers don't seem to realise that such a call also means that they need to shorten their dog's lead.

Sadly, there isn't actually any real, formally recognised etiquette to be observed on trails or on pavements.

I've only asked a TM to try and get a train held once. I was on an EMR service Norwich-Nottingham that had been delayed near Ely due to signalling issues. We were, as a result, due to pull into Nottingham at the same time as my next train, an XC to Birmingham, was due to depart. To his credit, he did try, but XC was only willing to cooperate to a point, waiting for just five minutes...and unfortunately there was a further delay outside of Nottingham, so as we all piled off the Sprinter on 11C we heard the whistles blowing on 9B and saw the TurboStar start to pull away.

The TM had told me when I asked that this might happen, because it wasn't the last train to Birmingham. Apparently if it had been, then they'd have been required to wait a little longer, because the EMR train wasn't excessively delayed.
