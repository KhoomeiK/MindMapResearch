crows,ff3kor0,t3_er6n5x,1579543095.0,We had a youngster with Avian pox on his feet and around his beak.  We kept feeding him and he eventually healed up.   What gets them is they do not have the strength or community to help them get enough to eat or drink.  So you are doing the right thing.  You might want to read up on how contagious it is & then clean accordingly.
crows,ff1thxr,t3_eqvrt8,1579485824.0,I was going to suggest Kaeli too.  She got her degree here at the U of Washington under John M. Marzluff who one of the best in the crow world research.  Her Twitter is always informative.  Give her a try!!
crows,fepghjf,t3_epyrqm,1579319898.0,This is kind of like asking if the cat or dog in the house is the master of the house are the humans.   The answer is cloudy to some to others it is obvious.  Hence Crows being smarter than the cats & dogs must be in charge 100%
crows,fel58uy,t3_epp0ou,1579214336.0,Great pic with the red caboose and your new crow friend.  It will get really special when they begin to recognize you and the mob shows up.  I have learned to dole out the peanuts to make sure each gets one.  There is always a dominate male who will load his mouth up and scare the youngsters off.  Guess it takes a referee to keep peace in the murder.
cats,fek23nn,t1_fej1qq3,1579190969.0,Maybe it is the bed. BoBo was one of those outdoor cats my husband adopted since he seemed a bit skinny.  We figured he would go home for a bit and then decide he wanted to roam his hood.  Include peeking on GiGi.
cats,fek1ybs,t1_feimwjv,1579190879.0,That made me laugh.  I never thought about BoBo wanting to get GiGi's goat.
cats,fek1w37,t1_feidphp,1579190841.0,I posted a video of her attacking thru the window another cat.  I think in this case she was just sleeping and not fully awoke to realize BoBo loomed big behind her.  Love our goofy kids!!
crows,fefs56d,t3_eok2gk,1579063582.0,Score !!  you are on your way to being friends with them.  I have found that if they don't quite trust you they won't eat while you look at them.  I have to do what you did... walk away and then sneak a look.  But then after awhile or if they are really hungry they will start to get closer & closer to you while you watch.  Give em time!  They need to adopt you into the murder.  :)
crows,feafcm1,t3_enz29s,1578948001.0,"OMG - I agree with Novelcheek & that crow must have figured he was a goner more than once.   Crows don't swim well at all.  No webbed feet to get traction.

I wrote an article on my blog about a poor crow that was attacked by a gull and did not make it out of the water.  I was frantic and contemplated swimming out to save him in the frigid waters.  However, I convinced myself that was suicide for me so I had to walk away.  Here is the link - I warn that it is super sad affair no matter how you look at it.

MapPorn,fdtj10d,t3_emafpq,1578717458.0,"Seattle did the same thing - put in rail to places where the land was for sale.  We destroyed our rail and trollys in the 30s & 40s in favor of buses.  They were sold as being more mobile but it was really a ploy to get us to use oil and make tires.  Ugggg think if we had maintained and upgraded these rail lines how much better traffic would be and we would not be spending millions to rebuild it all.  One good thing is a lot of the railway roadbed has become walking, biking and jogging trails up here.  

Progress?"
cats,fdtedz6,t3_emuo1h,1578715563.0,"Reggie my big boy kitty loves to play with his kibble.  He pulls it out of the bowl with a paw & then chases it around.  When he catches it he eats it just like prey.  Don't think it is whisker fatigue cause he eats it out of the bowl too.

My old girl GiGi (she is 17 plus) loves a cup of water on the kitchen counter.  Just a bit spoiled since I hate to see her jump down if she does't need to.  

That is my two kids funny behavior that we just love."
crows,fdtbqdo,t3_emwi9s,1578714507.0,"Oh you are so good.  I have had a couple of disabled crows over the years I have made sure got fed when I am passing thru their territory.  My 39th St Crow has been gimpy (has a disabled claw) since 2012.  I saw her when I drove by just yesterday.  Her is a link to my blog post talking about her from 2012 thru 2018.  Hope you all enjoy this.

crows,fdr8fzu,t1_fdpjkj3,1578680949.0,That is too punny!!  Thanx
cats,fdex6bt,t3_el17il,1578348478.0,I thought he had wet feet but this was dry as can be.  It is actually imprinted into the carpet.  Pretty cool huh?
crows,fdevlqt,t3_ekqoug,1578347522.0,"Oh he is so cute - all beak and feet just like a puppy.  Like silverwarbler thinks I too believe this is a baby crow.  And is this a recent baby?  Here in North America tis the wrong season for this goofy baby crows or ravens.

Thanx for sharing"
crows,fcrdk8x,t3_eiftly,1577900386.0,"It is very sad about Canuck & I too am so sad to see Shawn's emails.  

This photo is related to some police activity and partly how this wonderful Crow became famous.  Here is the news story around that.

crows,fbrttlg,t3_ee89q3,1577046228.0,Wow - this is a tough one but I am siding on the crow.  Seems more slender in his general build and if I use the boards as a benchmark for size that makes him/her not big enough for a raven.  Fun puzzle to sort out.  Thanx
