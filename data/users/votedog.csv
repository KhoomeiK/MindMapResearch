raisedbynarcissists,fffrjwe,t3_etb3vj,1579890249.0,"When I went NC with my father, my Grandfather freaked out. He'd take new photos of the family (Where my father was not invited to attend) and have old photos of my father added so it looked like he was there. He said pretty much the same thing your Mom is, trying to convince me that my father changed or that I was overreacting. 

The thing is - we both know we aren't overreacting and for sure, our Ndad's haven't changed. Until the day he died, my Grandfather did not let go of the hope we'd all be a family again. I hated to see him disappointed but he didn't endure the abuse from my father, I did. The same goes for you OP. Your Mom may say this stuff until the day she dies, but that doesn't mean you have to do anything with it. You know what is best for you and if that means not having your Dad in your life, so be it. This is about you and nobody else can dictate how you should feel when they weren't the ones to go through it."
raisedbynarcissists,fffpnx5,t3_etchhs,1579889082.0,">I honestly don't know what to do or how to correct my relationship with her.

It may be that you can't. She is who she is and people don't often change unless they want to. The best thing to do is just work on you. Maybe in time you can work together in therapy but for now, do what's best for you and your sanity/health.

>she threatens to bring me back by force to Morocco and marry me against my will if I don't resolve my financial situation.

If you're an adult, how would they force you to return to somewhere you don't want to be? I'm sorry you lost your job but I bet you'll find another soon. Keep your head up, we're here for you!"

raisedbynarcissists,fffoexu,t1_fffobya,1579888311.0,Im so happy to hear that! We've all been where you are and we know there really is a light at the end of the tunnel.
raisedbynarcissists,fffo8sd,t3_etcr35,1579888208.0,"OP, you aren't alone. I know it feels like it will never get better but I promise you, it will. If you are seriously considering suicide, please, please, please seek help from a guidance counselor at school or maybe a teacher. 

You're not a bad person, in any way. They are the bad ones for treating you like they do and it's not your fault. You can get through this, we're here for you and always will be!"
raisedbynarcissists,fffntcb,t3_etcwuu,1579887949.0,"Man, I'm so sorry OP. I know how you feel, my parents favored my little sister too and I began to resent her for it. As a kid, like you, I could do nothing about it and it was frustrating and depressing. Now as an adult, I'm not close to my sister because she is used to being the one they loved the most and used it to her advantage.

Therapy is what saved me but I wasn't able to do that until I was older. You aren't alone though, many of us know how this feels and how much it hurts. Keep us posted and keep your head up.

You did not overreact at all so ignore those that say that. You do what's right for you and your fuzzy kids. Just because you are blood related to someone does not mean you need to have a close relationship, or any relationship at all. Keep a distance from people who tell you aren't living your life right, cause fuck them, it's your life and you can do what makes you happy.

EntitledBitch,fff4p0a,t1_fff13el,1579875624.0,"Someone else’s kids are not my responsibility, nor my concern. I do not owe parents, or their kids, anything. If someone decides to have children, it’s 199% their job to make them into decent, respectful, human beings, not mine. 

It’s interesting that you see disrespecting someone’s rules and boundaries as “anti child”. Some people don’t like kids, so what? Some people don’t like chocolate too and even though I don’t understand it, I respect it by not shoving chocolate at them. You’re the person who believes that every human needs to be just like you and that’s simply selfish and entitled."

I wasn't all that comfortable with them being in the house but I wanted to learn how to use them because if she wasn't home and something happened, I'd want to be able to protect myself. I'm still not 100% around them but I respect the power they have and know how to use them safely. Compromise is the key!"

Iâ€™d rather read the testimony of the doctors who are licensed in this kind of thing.

His parents refused to take their names off his bank account (a small random bank not found everywhere) and they went over his bank statements with a fine tooth comb. EM would call and criticize him, also texting me and my wife photos of the statement with rude comments about where he spent his money. One day I showed him the texts and told him it was time to start adulting. We opened him a new account at a more common bank and he stopped using the other one. His EM was PISSED. Said she had a right to see his banking and demanded copies now that she wasnâ€™t able to view them on her own. He and I both said nope. She claimed it was to help him learn about finances and she was only trying to help. I told her since he lived with me now, Iâ€™d help! She didnâ€™t talk to me for nearly two months hahaha"

atheism,fehkaqe,t3_ep51iz,1579118277.0,"Many moons ago I decided to become a surrogate and carry a baby for a childless couple. 99% of the people who contacted me were dead set against adopting because the baby would then not look like them (I always asked why they opted not to adopt). They all said the same thing ""we're praying to have our own"" as if prayer would somehow put a baby in their doppelgÃ¤nger, allowing them to have a new mini-me. For that reason, I insisted on only working with gay couples. Straight couples can adopt so much easier than gays, they just refuse to. I pissed off a lot of couples when I told them I'd never work with someone who cared more about what the child looked like rather than their health. They got even madder when I suggested maybe their 'god' was telling them not to have their own. After 6-10 years of trying, maybe it's just not meant to be? They insisted that wasn't the case, 'god' just had not yet blessed them yet. Riiight."
