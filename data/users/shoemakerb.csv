Some people make it into a liquid marinade by adding soy sauce and calamansi juice.  It's a small fruit that's sort of like a lemon or lime."
LifeProTips,ffhdk4n,t3_etb8je,1579930929.0,"And let's not forget my favorite name of all time, held by the famous racecar driver, Dick Trickle."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffhcn0y,t3_etf4m1,1579929997.0,"I heard something recently that I hadn't before.  Supposedly the wooded area near where he was last heard from includes some swamp.

I don't recall which podcast this was on, but the scenario, if the above is accurate is both plausible and the most likely explanation.

He's walking around in an unfamiliar area in the middle of the night, drunk.  He walks into the swamp and falls in.  He drowns and his cell phone dies from being submerged in water.  

Even if it's only a few inches of water, he could be too uncoordinated to get up, and may be too drunk to realize there's no air, not until he begins to inhale water.

When people go looking for him, he's either submerged, or he's hidden by brush (I just heard about a murder victim who was found--right in one of the areas teams had already searched.  People walked right by her, in some cases over her, due to her being well hidden by her surroundings.

I think the cops, etc. have a good idea of what might have happened.  We haven't heard much about the case lately.  They don't want to give TOO much publicity to a case that's likely to be a drunken fall.  Also one where local and imported search teams failed to find a body that was right near them."
sex,ffca65p,t3_esqxbv,1579795024.0,"Stay with what you have, if you can resist the impulse.  I am only one guy, but I'll bet most guys like big breasts because they're from ""the luck of the draw."" Implants aren't all that great because anyone can buy them ""off the rack.""

Your breasts are unique, just like the rest of you.  Anyone who loves you, loves them.  If you really want them, that's fine, but get them only because you're 100 percent OK with the idea.

And yes, implants can reduce the sensations in breasts.  They can make lumps more difficult to discover, too!"

I had been going to one--way out of my way-- where I got a happy ending first time, and was told in advance it didn't cost extra.  The girl was happy with a $20 tip. This was the case every time.

Then a new place opened right near me.  It looked the same as the other, so I gave it a try.  She did the happy ending without asking then refused my $20, demanding $40.  I gave it to her, and she said ""$60 would be better.""  

I wound up giving it to her to get out of there without incident, because I saw no one else there to talk to.  And I never went back!"

Filipino Fried Chicken, if you're not making it in a restaurant, is done by seasoning it, steaming it, then deep frying it to make the skin crispy.  

It makes perfect sense to do it the way shown here.  You skip a step and avoid drying out the chicken.  I can't do it the ""homemade"" way without drying it out!"

I no longer feel like initiating sex since I realized she was doing it out of a sense of obligation more than anything. Even though the sex itself was OK."

I'm not, but I wish I was.  We're doing counseling.  I had told the therapist what all I thought was wrong before my wife started coming to sessions, and the therapist seemed optimistic. 

 However, we still haven't done enough work on our differences.  I can't muster enough enthusiasm to initiate sex, and she never has during our whole marriage (severe cultural and communication difficulties exist)."

His later movies were even better.  All the female stars were former Playboy playmates or Penthouse Pets, and there were always parts played by semi-famous actors like Erik Estrada or Pat Morita."

They had my car and license plate info right.  Only trouble is, I haven't been in VA for a couple of years, and this is the first I've heard about it.  

It was one of those traffic cameras and I never got any notification from the state of my violation.  (can't recall if this newest letter contained any photo or info).

People saw him talking to someone in a car in the store's parking lot, but no one saw the actual shot which left him dead in the street.

This happened in 1986 and is still unsolved."

ketorecipes,fdo9ooq,t1_fdnunq5,1578601301.0,"The recipe uses erythitrol, which is the main ingredient in Swerve, and the filler ingredient in the monkfruit ingredient that measures the same as sugar.

Personally, I think erythitrol has an unpleasant aftertaste which is much less noticeable in recipes using fruit, especially citrus.  No one else seems to notice it, until I read this thread.

My favorite sweetener for baking is this new one, Allulose.  It tastes good, and doesn't cause gastric distress like the sugar alcohols like erythitrol.

Plus it browns, and hangs on to moisture--like sugar, unlike most artificial sweeteners.  That means whatever you've made is moist and doesn't go stale almost immediately."

AskReddit,fcb6f9e,t1_fc9j20h,1577582965.0,"You Just reminded me of The Portsmouth Sinfonia.

They were an orchestra in Great Britain in the 1970s.  The only requirement to join was that you showed up.  You didn't have to have any musical ability, or even the ability to play your chosen instrument (maybe it was they required that you didn't have the ability).

Anyway, Brian Eno of Roxy Music helped them get going and they were fairly popular.

UnresolvedMysteries,fcauq32,t1_fc9dfaz,1577576990.0,"Now that they know who, they can work backwards and figure out the how and why.  That's what happened in a high profile case in PA, Bucks County I think.  

A school teacher got really savagely murdered in her living room, right as she was leaving for school in the morning. Cops were baffled.  It seemed like a very personal crime, but everyone she knew was eventually eliminated.  

As for a ""stranger danger"" crime, who commits a random, super violent rape/ murder in someone's house at 8 in the morning? AND is nowhere on the cops' radar?  When they finally tested the DNA, there was no match in the database.

The case was unsolved for decades, until they tried checking ""familial DNA""  This eventually led them to an unlikely suspect--a very popular club/event DJ in town.  A local celebrity. 

 Then they got a positive match using discarded DNA, did some investigating based on that, and found out he knew the woman from the club where he worked.  He was interested in her and  she rebuked his advances.  He stopped by her house one morning, probably was rejected again, he flew into a rage, and that was the connection and motive that had eluded them.  

They had no problem convicting him."
