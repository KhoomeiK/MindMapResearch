But if you're already in a relationship with that person and you get strange cues on and on, and end up having to ask people on the internet then you're def gonna suffer due a lack of communication"

morbidquestions,fez1jzs,t3_eqxwpk,1579453066.0,"I've read that we are all born with the instinct to be murderers, it's in our DNA, in order to survive we had to hunt, defend ourselves from neighboring clans etc...

As we grow up, society, proper parenting, environmental conditions etc... teach us that we don't need this in order to survive, so we kind of dropped this ""killer instinct"" we once had. 

I believe the instinct to kill comes back in the case of a crisis like defending a loved one or killing for food for most people."

serialkillers,fdmlcrt,t1_fdmkenm,1578554276.0,"I've been to therapists before but they never diagnosed me with anything or at least they didn't tell me what I had

I relate to him in the sense that I was and still am socially awkward and very shy.

serialkillers,fdmcm30,t3_em01w8,1578545639.0,"I think Derf and his friends didn't mean harm to Jeffrey, they just thought he was funny and strange. Jeff wasn't the talkative type either so how could they have known? They were teenagers at the time too, probably focused on girls, grades and other things regular teenagers focus on. I'd blame the adults in his life and the adults at school that failed to see that this kid was in tremendous pain, drowning his sorrow in alcohol (homosexuality in an intolerant environment obviously, his parents constant fighting and a huge chance he was physically/psychologically and/or sexually abused in some way, which he was in complete denial of)

Jeff pulled off some inappropriate crap too, I watched a video off the oxygen website, one of his friends (if we can call her that after hearing how she talks about him...) mentions an incident at pizza hut where he was doing his usual dahmerisms and completely destroyed the pizza, with that I can understand why they were sometimes reluctant to hang out with him outside school

I believe reading somewhere he really was a fan of Neil Sedaka lol, the other kid he was friends with in the movie, I don't know if he existed

When he had that party I think they were stoner kids from the neighborhood and school (not 100% sure though)"
cats,fdanadh,t1_fd9s84b,1578247919.0,"Mine was an alpha too, he was FIV positive I think he caught it because he was fighting all the time (even if he was neutered, but I named him Caesar so I guess he had the soul of a conqueror lol). He was very tired in the end but I fed him good food and would bring him outside to enjoy nature. I brought him to the vet to put to sleep because one day he couldn't take it anymore and tried to jump off the balcony. I really miss him, but I know I did my best to give him a great life ‚ù§"

SuicideWatch,fcssmmo,t1_fcsluxb,1577924083.0,"I tried living with my dad a while but he's an alcoholic and is very irresponsible, I had to move back to my mom's, as the years have passed by my mom made me feel responsible for what has happened to me, the brainwashing was very efficient because she's a psychologist (real shocking thinking back, they're supposed to help people not bring them down). The responsibility made me feel weak and incapable of doing anything on my own. I lived with ex boyfriends but it always ended up being a disaster

I started recovery with a great therapist and then found 12 step groups such as SIA which have helped me recover immensely in only 6 months, I know I still have lots of recovering to do but I'm learning to love myself now which is something I didn't know how to do"
SuicideWatch,fcs84um,t3_eimyj9,1577912785.0,"We have similar abuse stories

I've been abused by my step dad's brother at age 10 and my step dad continued on after that, it happened until I was 15, my mom read my diary one day when I was seeing my dad for vacation, that's how she found out. The abuse stopped after that but she blamed me for seducing him and he's still with her to this day. What our mothers did is devastating to our sense of self worth.

I'm 31 now and still healing from my scars, but I can assure you that life for me today is worth every second. Even when I have dark thoughts that come back I know they're not permanent anymore. I'm in multiple self help programs and they work for me, I've never felt better about myself.

It's good you express yourself about this

Take care ‚ù§"
SuicideWatch,fcs50lt,t3_einblb,1577911553.0,"First of all I am sorry you feel that way

Second I've had suicidal thoughts in my past, I wont go into detail but I almost tried one day, my pets are really what kept me from doing it, I didn't want them to end up in a bad home or put down. I'm glad I had that moment of lucidity. Life is sometimes unbearable, the thoughts of killing myself sometimes come back but I do my best not to keep them.

The present moment must be hard for you, but try to remember that the future will have good things for you too, it's how life works. I can't stop you from doing it behind my phone, I hope you'll change your mind and come to realize how important it is to live your life."

raisedbynarcissists,fc3zwt9,t1_fc3wqbc,1577402967.0,"I used to punch myself because it wouldn't leave any visible marks

Narcissists are good at making others feel responsible, my mom went as far as to blame me for how pregnancy changed her body... 

It'll get easier once you fully accept that you have NEVER been responsible for the pain she's going through. You've already took the first step by acknowledging she is a narcissist. You aren't responsible for whatever she blames you for as a child, whatever reaction you had or whatever mistake you did. Get away from her as soon as you can."
raisedbynarcissists,fc3vezv,t3_eg1oh0,1577399625.0,"I am so sorry to hear that, none of this is your fault. My mom used to start drama on my special days and on Christmas on a regular basis. Now that I live far away from her the drama is over. I know the feeling of having those inner voices telling me how ""worthless"" or ""stupid"" I am. I even used to punch myself in the head when the pressure was too big

You probably already know this but your mom obviously has trauma from her past, now this doesn't mean she's in her right to treat you the way she does.

ACA (Adult Children of Alcoholics or other dysfunctional families Anonymous) meetings and the 12 step program (which I still am working on) have helped me a lot in understanding my trauma and the whole family dysfunction. I've had a wonderful therapist help me too.

I don't know your current life situation, if you're still a minor most self help groups are for adults but maybe a school social worker can help with healthy coping mechanisms.

I hope you'll find a solution quickly, I'm sending you all the cyber love I can ‚ù§
