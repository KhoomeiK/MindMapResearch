Alcott herself never married, and so the film basically takes two stances on what happens to its version of Jo. The version of Jo who writes the novel never marries (as Alcott never did) and the fictional version of herself does. This is why the negotiation scene is edited to begin before her and Frederic's first kiss.

The mistreatment of animals is a problem. I can acknowledge this while still eating meat. However, it is a second-order issue in a world where we as humans don't even know how to treat each other. We have to achieve a society in which we value each other's lives over capital. Only then can we get to the business of either improving farming practices or transforming diets and food practices, etc. Look at what is happening in Kashmir and then tell me those folks should be talking about the plight of chickens more.
