Edit: The fatlogic-y, or at least worrisome, part is that it sounds like you're stuffing yourself with food even when you're not particularly hungry. And based on your other comment, if you're binging at night, you may not be eating during the day in a way that's right for you.

Edit 2: Per other's replies, your numbers indicate you are underweight for your height. While meal timing is still less important than total calories consumed, you may want to find a way to consume more calories overall. Being underweight is just as dangerous to your health as being obese."

Also, lessons learned from this holiday season. It's ok to have Feast days. Even one a week, depending on how many legitimate celebrations there are. It's also ok to intersperse those feast days with deficit days and maintenance days, depending on my needs and how hectic the season becomes. 

However, for me, it is absolutely NOT ok to treat the season as an opportunity to careen off the rails and stay there in my train wreck of dietary choices for weeks on end, *even if I cut weight ahead of time to account for the train wreck*.

I'm not too far into it yet, but so far it seems to be about dismantling the cultural norms that prevent men from understanding and engaging with their full range of emotions.

Hooks says, however, that by even daring to engage with men, rather than just writing them off as hopeless, she has been branded a traitor to the feminist movement.

I have a young son too, almost two years old. I am a masculine lesbian ""dad"" (my wife is Mom) and it's been a trip so far, negotiating what masculinity means, and how it is and isn't tied to maleness, and what it means to be a ""good man"".

However, multiple people on this sub have noted that in female-dominated fitness/health groups, the emphasis tends to be on creating ""safe spaces"" for people's feelings, which at its most extreme, leads to coddling people and their excuses and prioritizing group harmony over personal accountability and achievement. 

Likewise, male-dominated, achievement-oriented, ""no bullshit"" spaces can go too far in the other direction, treating participants as the ""girlie men"" referenced in the quote if they fail to measure up."

Humans are inherently social primates. We are interdependent creatures, to the point that an adult in a traditional society who gets ostracized from their community will probably not survive for long on their own. A human being who is truly on their own is exquisitely vulnerable. ""Modern"" adults may have forgotten this, because Western society allows us never to leave the house if we don't want to. 

But kids? Kids are inherently vulnerable humans, and *they know it*. They know, deep down, that if they cease to be under the protection of the adults in their lives, they will be at the mercy of any human predators out there. This is one of the reasons why kids are so sensitive to any form of unfairness or the sense of being negatively singled out - it indicates that the adults on whom they depend are willing to treat them poorly compared to others in their family.

If a cookie is a prized resource in one's family, and a child perceives that they're being denied their ""fair share"" of that resource, then yes, that cookie *does* represent love and stability. From an evolutionary perspective, being treated as unworthy of that cookie when the others in the family are not must be a deeply unsettling experience, because it indicates that in some way, they don't quite belong."

I actually agree with her in the sense that our body is ours to do with as we wish, whether that's base jumping, face tattoos, or eating shellfish while having a known shellfish allergy. The right of self-ownership includes the right to do stupid stuff and accept the consequences for it.

However, to quote Marcus Aurelius, ""Pleasures taken too far become punishments."" To be truly free, we must be able to master ourselves such that we can direct our energies toward creating our best self, not succumbing to every whim that crosses our path."
fatlogic,fckdtif,t1_fck56lp,1577723090.0,"I can see how that would work for kids who aren't too fat and will be able to hold steady until their height catches up to their weight. Some kids, though, are so fat that they'll likely never be able to grow into their weight- like 11yo girls who are already 200lb, for example. But that hypothetical kid should probably be medically supervised, like you mentioned."

Hey y'all! Anyone (u/ElizaPornberry and u/Roadless_Soul, maybe lookin at you?)  interested in doing Dry January to help get back on track after the debauchery of the holidays? Running from Mon, Jan 6 thru Sun, Feb 2, because all worthwhile things must start on a Monday?"
fatlogic,fc2hi3s,t3_efhh7r,1577360522.0,"I have been eating and drinking like a glorious food-dumpster for a bit over a week now. Have not stepped on the scale. I'm sure I'm up a pound or two of fat and an unholy amount of water weight. But I planned for this by cutting hard going into the season, so I'm not worried. 

However, I gotta admit, I feel so much better when I eat a balanced diet, that I'm happy to get back on track sooner rather than later."
