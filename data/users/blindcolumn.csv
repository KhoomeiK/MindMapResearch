neoliberal,fek1u79,t1_fejlh06,1579190808.0,Policy positions are only a small part of what makes a good president. The president's role in directing policy is much smaller than a lot of people seem to think. Temperament and political prowess are much more important.

wokekids,feedj3u,t1_feecvp9,1579031527.0,"Yeah it's used to imply that liberals/leftists are all ""cucks"" who want their wives to cheat on them. There's also often a racial element, with the ""wife's son"" portrayed as black or mixed race.

This is because alt-righters are highly insecure and spend a lot of time worrying that non-white men are stealing ""their"" women."
