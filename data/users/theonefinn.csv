Technically this is considered a bad configuration and allows the DNS server to be weaponised for (D)DOS attacks.

There are generally two types of queries, recursive queries and authoritative queries.

A recursive query is when you ask for something the server doesn’t know first hand about, like asking your ISP’s DNS server for www.google.com, the server doesn’t know so then has to query another server (hence recursive).

An authoritative query is asking a DNS server for something it does know about first hand, for instance the above google lookup will finish when one of the servers in the chain finally asks a google DNS server for the address (caching can affect this but isn’t really relevant to the discussion)

In general, unless you are google, you should only have recursive lookups enabled from local networks. I.E. an ISP would only allow recursive lookups from their own customers, not from any random address on the web. The DNS server would still answer authoritative requests from anyone, it has to, to allow people to look up the ISP’s domain, but there is no reason for it to provide recursive lookups to a random third party."

Each hydrogen cooling regulator is worth almost 18 degrees per kilo per second of sour gas. Given that you can also exchange heat between the various input/output stages (eg cool your sour gas with your input oil/petrol and then your methane) the cooling requirements are less than something like a LOX cooler where you need somewhere to move/delete the heat.

It’s definitely a viable build pre-space, the hardest bit is the “hot side” and getting the sour gas reliably down to the 275 degrees needed to pump it with steel."
