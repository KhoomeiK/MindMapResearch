Libertarian,ffov877,t1_ffomgj2,1580082203.0,"What other tool do we have?  “Our votes”?  Lol, we just ping pong between two shitty parties.  We need to use SOME tool to get that screw in the wall, or else it will continue to be left on the table unused forever.

And the framers of the constitution provided that tool.  Impeachment.  Impeach every president who violates the spirit or letter of the constitution.  Impeach early, impeach often."

insanepeoplefacebook,ffou45t,t1_ffopxvu,1580081866.0,You’re right.  Taking two hours each quarter to make a spreadsheet means they should be paid far more than people with equivalent or greater education who work more hours.

Libertarian,ffoszln,t1_ffoc5m2,1580081356.0,"Being intelligent doesn’t mean being an expert on everything.  Usually you have a specialty, and ideally you listen to other intelligent people with different specialties to inform your decisions on things you don’t specialize in.

But if you don’t do that, yeah, you’ll probably make some bad decisions."

A beefy plastic lower for an AR platform, with the upper and barrel in steel?  I’d take that over an axe any day.

It should be legal, don’t get me wrong.  But some uses for 3D firearms printing are quite effective if you also have access to legit firearms parts."
Libertarian,ffoqoex,t3_eu7rjg,1580080502.0,"I’m too biased on taxes to feel confident in my ability to logically analyze it.  I recognize the need for them to some degree, but some types of taxes I find much more distasteful than others.  Not because of a logical or financial reason, just a gut feeling of it being “more wrong”.  I really don’t like taxes on passive things like wealth or property, but I recognize that my negative reaction to them as opposed to taxes on actions is largely not objective."

Libertarian,ffom400,t1_ffoknd9,1580079021.0,"The standards are too low and need to go up.  I don’t know how any libertarian could argue with that.  

Ordering trillions of dollars in drone strikes and invasions should not be the normal thing for a president to do.  Neither should funneling money into your own pocket through your office.  Neither should a lot of things."
Libertarian,ffokg56,t1_ffo0u1f,1580078558.0,Sure it can.  You still need the house to impeach and 3/4 of the senate to remove.  It’s not like it’s too easy.  If it was I think we would see more removals.
insanepeoplefacebook,ffoh0og,t3_eubgfi,1580077557.0,$60k for 9 months of work seems a little high for a minimum wage.  That’s the equivalent of $80k for 12 months.  That’s high for a starting engineering salary.  Sounds like a good way to get larger class sizes and fewer jobs.
Libertarian,ffnoeyo,t1_ffmdizr,1580068534.0,No.  It was deliberately set up to be in any case of misbehavior or maladministration (or worse).

StarWars,ffkpvud,t1_ffkmbml,1580026816.0,It’s basically just some cosmetic changes to an Mauser C96 design (from 1896) chambered in 9mm.  So it’d be legal anywhere a 9mm semiauto pistol is legal.

Everyone’s saying how much I won.  I won that fight very much.  I won.  I always win.  Everyone knows I always win.  That’s why I win.  Nobody wins more than me.  Everyone always says how nobody wins more than me.  Look... everyone already knows I won, so why are we still talking about the fact that I won?  I won and that’s all, let’s move on.

Libertarian,ffk12uk,t1_ffjwqoq,1580012571.0,"But seriously, yes I’ve seen the videos.  They analyze trump’s tactics and explain why they work on some people.  It’s very basic stuff, and in many cases the guy says “don’t do this, people will dislike you and mistrust you”.  

How is any of that essential proof that trump is in any way charismatic?  Why would some random YouTuber be essential viewing *required* for talking about a politician?  

I’m beginning to think you may not even know what the word charisma actually means."

A persistent vegetative state and brain damage is not the same thing as having no regular brainwaves.  If she had no regular brainwaves then there would have been no controversy, the doctors would have just declared time of death and then taken her body off of life support, as is standard practice."
