You can easily see and feel the poor dude's terror and confusion. He did his best to comply with conflicting orders, while drunk and confused, and still got murdered. Fucking bullshit that the cop who fired got acquitted. Disgusting."
insanepeoplefacebook,ffhcnm3,t1_ffgw1ri,1579930012.0,"I'm completely *certain* he has. They need to come forward.. unfortunately that's asking a lot, knowing his insane base would just call them liars and all sorts of other disgusting things."

MorbidReality,ffgzu7l,t1_ffgx1ih,1579919334.0,I'm sure they'd go for manslaughter as it would be easier to prove. Murder is a fairly high bar and something like this would probably be too iffy when dealing with a jury. But it really just seems to me (especially since she said she knew it would be in the breast milk) that she knew what she was doing. It's just sickening. That's a really fucking terrible way to die and she did that to her little tiny baby.

Politics aside, please try to enjoy your older relatives while they're around, as much as possible. Cancer took my dad a few months ago; we only had about three months' warning. I miss him a lot and would do anything to have one more good-natured argument with him."

Thanks for sharing your experience with me! That must have been extra confusing, happening when you were that young.. mine was just a couple years ago, in my 30s. I'm really glad it stopped; it leaves you feeling kind of out of control. It's really freaky!"
