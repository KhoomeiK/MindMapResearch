I just couldn't figure out how your towels were getting so trashed, towels aren't cheap! You might save some towels by using a soap dauber and an old toothbrush for your soap+water, and just using your hands to rub the oil in. Most leather conditioners are body safe, it shouldn't cause harm to have it on your hands (also tbh I think a lot of the conditioners smell nice and they're good for skin too, like a very masculine hand lotion). I do keep separate towels for leather care, but I keep enough on hand to work through 10+ pairs in a night if I need to, just having one or two hand towels to reuse should be okay. I can see how the grease would be tough to get out for sure."

First, you need to know if you're boot/shoe is oil tanned leather, or something else; high shine, suede, and nubuck are your most likely other options. I'd hazard a guess that about 95% of the time, if not more, what you've got is an oil tan. Oil tanned leather is soft, supple, has a more [matte surface](https://www.picclickimg.com/d/l400/pict/143240526250_/Double-H-5008-Black-Oiltan-LEATHER-HARNESS-Work-Motorcycle.jpg), it's both [more durable](https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-s62r70/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/204/4908/Carolina-905-linesman-boot__43124.1462392544.jpg?c=2) and more comfortable than highshine so is used more. About the only place you see highshine is on some [military boots](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YNWMODHLsVc/maxresdefault.jpg) and [fancy dress shoes](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/24/17/a1/2417a17e0ee60a8b61fe95bf1cd4e0f3.jpg). Suede and nubuck both have almost a [hairy](https://cache.mrporter.com/images/products/1200812/1200812_mrp_cu_l.jpg) look to them, they are extremely soft to the touch, almost like velvet. I'm happy to give pointers for those processes to if you need them, but the boots above are oil tan, so here we go with that.

Okay, so you're pretty sure you have oil tan leather. You're going to want: a [**soap dauber**](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/PEPgfaNiL9FZikAI3pBJLkfPa_pqTqU9NdztdqHxZiGLyF-avX6r8Cu53_pLZ1il1_cGmUPoPf2Shz_rfuVXMFzvM6nu8jIv3S-za92Bk3JGKIVn), some kind of **saddle soap** (tons of brands out there, Kiwi and Fiebing's seem easiest to find, at least in the states) **or glycerin soap** (like Neutrogena facial soap, skip ones with extra scents or additives), **a spray bottle** full of water, a **towel/rag/old T-shirt**,a **leather oil or conditioner** (more on this below). Optional add-ons are an old toothbrush, Q-tips, a boot buffing brush, and possibly a **dubbin** (also more on this below)

There are LOTS of possible conditioning products, all are a little different, people have favorites sometimes for all sorts of reasons: your grandpappy used it, you like the smell, you need it to be vegan, you're allergic to some of them, whatever. I personally like [Huberd's Shoe Grease](http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRwi6SJ7f6Wg4bOTLU4TNGoCPoW-d3BgIB3TEhAkUemUZ31HzGzHNMqPnrytG07yhuBmx4s_DU&usqp=CAc) because it smells good, is a largely natural list of ingredients, and is fairly safe to put on skin. I personally avoid products that are made from animals (neatsfoot oil, mink oil) because I worry that they may go rancid over time but some people swear by them. A conditioner/oil works the same way that lotion works on your skin, it adds fats that keep the leather from drying out, as well as forming a water-repellent layer, because water beads up off of oil. If you take your boots into very very wet places often, you may want a dubbin--a dubbin is harder, usually waxier, than a conditioner. Although it provides some conditioning (so does the saddle soap, btw), it is more about water-proofing the leather more than a conditioner is able to. Products like Sno-Seal or Chelsea Dubbin Leatherfood are dubbins. 

Okay, the actual steps. Sorry, I'm long-winded about this I guess.

1. Take off the laces then wash that dirty boot. Spray some water on your boot and on your soap dauber. Get some soap on the dauber. Swirly whirly it on the boot. Add more soap and/or water as needed. If you've really got some mud/salt/whatever caked into the space between the leather and sole (called the 'catwalk', btw), you can go after it with an old toothbrush.
2. Get your yucky soap off that boot. Use more water, your towel, Q-tips if you need to get some out from the eyelets. Be thorough, dried on soap isn't terrible for the leather but it's better for it to be clean. You don't like walking around with soap crusties on your face, right?
3. Let the first boot dry while you do the same thing to the other boot. If you really had to get it wet to get it clean, prop it up by a fan or baseboard heater to help out. You can repeat these steps as many times as you need if your boots are super dirty, if they're regular dirty just once is usually sufficient.
4. Time to condition. Use your fingertips to scoop up a *very small* amount of conditioner. Rub your hands together to get, again I cannot stress this enough, a *thin* layer of oil/grease/conditioner on your hands. They should look a little oily, you shouldn't have pools or rivers of grease on your hands. You can always add more if your leather is thirsty, but adding too much is harder to deal with, and if you really overdo it you will weaken your leather.
5. Give your boots a massage with your lightly oiled hands. The heat and motion from your hands helps work it into the leather. Do the second boot. Look at your first boot again. Are there spots that still look dry? Rub a little bit more into those spots. Again, don't overdo it. You can always come back to it later, it's better to under-condition than over-condition. If you have a boot brush you can use this to buff the boot at this point, but it isn't necessary. It just evens out any remaining oil on the surface. If you do this, only use that boot brush for oil tan boots! If you try to use it on high shine boots after you're going to have a harder time getting a good shine, oil and polish don't play together nicely.
6. If you're going to put on a dubbin, now's the time. Same style, use your hands, rub it in. Some people like heating up their boots in an oven set on a very low temperature first, as it helps the waxes in the dubbin really melt and seep into the pores of the leather. Again, dubbins are useful for more thorough water-proofing if you need it.
7. Put your laces back on, you're all done! Also now your hands are conditioned and probably smell nice, bonus."

Frugal,fewkdni,t1_fet6bse,1579412559.0,"I love learning about how folks use different products and techniques, especially ones passed down from older generations! I had never heard of Johnson's paste wax before, I can see how it would waterproof the leather over time. I'm assuming you like the results you've gotten with it in your other leather shoes/boots? Can you describe what it smells like? Sometimes the petroleum distillate products smell really... well, plastic-y. I personally tend to prefer products that are more natural and body safe (though personally avoid things like neatsfoot oil, as I've heard it can go rancid), though polishes usually aren't, and different strokes for different folks and all that. 

I think you were correct in not conditioning these boots before dying, you would want the leather to be a little ""dry"" to soak up the liquid dye best. I haven't had cause to dye a pair of boots yet (someday hopefully, I want to try!) but I don't believe you should need to seal the dye in, as long as you've wiped off any excess and let the leather dry out before wearing them. The color in the dye should seep into the leather, staining it the new, darker color. I have heard of folks going over boots with dye more than once if they found it didn't take evenly the first time, but I assume it's a bit like putting a Sharpie to a piece of paper--once the color is in, it's in.

Anyway, I'm fully of the mind that as long as it's working for you, it's a good technique. Bootblacks have all manner of preferred methods, products, techniques, and different things work differently for different people! I think if I had been presented with boots I needed to dye, I'd have washed them with my preferred glycerin soap ([Rebel Suds](https://www.rebelandrefuge.com/rubs-and-suds/)), applied the dye, let it sit for a day or so, dried and washed them again (maybe a few times to make sure the dye really wasn't going to run). If they needed a second coat of dye would repeat the process. Then condition with Huberd's Boot Grease, then maybe add a dubbin for water-proofing purposes; probably Chelsea's Leather Food if it were for lighter indoor wear, probably something beeswax based if they were for heavy outdoor use or in a city that salts the roads heavily, maybe SnoSeal or the little tub of homemade stuff someone gifted me, just to try it out. This is well past the point of frugality I will admit! I suspect my kit has around $200 worth of products and tools in it, and I can always name just one more thing I'd like to add to it..."
Frugal,fet2qru,t3_epdqga,1579371295.0,"Hey, you did a great job here, but as someone who does this as a hobby I do want to chime in. These boots look like oil tan leather to me, which is what I'd expect in work boots. Oil tan leather is softer and more supple than high shine leather, which is what you'd see on something like military dress boots. There are other leather types used in boots but these are the common two you end up needing to distinguish between.

You're probably going to find that the polish will crack and flake off of these over time. Polish is made of a hard wax, it isn't flexible, which is why you can get that mirror polish ""spit shine"" look on military boots. But that leather is stiff and inflexible so it doesn't bend the wax. This leather is more flexible, so the creasing and flexing will cause the polish to flake off. This isn't bad for the boot, it just won't be protecting the leather and may not look as nice as you want, also you may start leaving polish bits around.

What you want for oil tan leather is saddle soap to clean them and a leather conditioner to both condition and water proof (to some extent) the leather. There are lots of conditioners out there, Huberds is very well respected, Chelsea's makes one with black dye in it that will keep the color saturated in the leather (though the dye you used should hold up well over time). Only use a little bit of conditioner, you aren't trying to make the leather sopping wet, just working a little grease into it. You'll want to remove the polish before conditioning the first time, the two products don't react well with each other, they'll make a goopy mess probably. You can likely remove the polish just with a good scrubbing of saddle soap, as it probably didn't bond well to the oil tan leather to begin with. YouTube has many offerings on how to learn to condition oil tan boots.

And of course, you can always do what you want with your own boots if you're pleased with the results. I've known people who manage to get a very high shine on oil tan boots just because they felt like it (it just took a lot of layers and patience). I'm not trying to rag on your job, it looks great!

Dogtraining,fdubq2k,t1_fdovz8s,1578730889.0,"I don't think this is just a case of him losing control of his bladder because he's excited. If that were the case, he would just pee as soon as you came home, because he's clearly very excited at that time. My guess is that this is a submissive gesture that is meant to preemptively appease you. Especially the fact that after he does it he then goes into the corner, another appeasing gesture. 

Something in your body language is making him feel as though he needs to appease you. It very well could be something as minor as you looking at him. When you get home, try not to look at him and as calmly and non-threateningly as possible, get his leash on so you can get him outside to go to the bathroom. This is even easier if you have a yard, because all you have to do is calmly open the door for him. Be mindful of ""looming"" over him, when you go to clip the leash on his collar do it from a kneeling or crouching position, so you can come in from below rather than from above. You can try talking really slowly and gently at him while you do it, make sure your tone is upbeat and happy, not too low, which can be interpreted as anger and set off the appeasement gestures.

My dog will do this too sometimes, though thankfully hers is just the tiniest sprinkle and it's only when she already needed to go, like if I was getting home from work. I just talk to her in a happy but laidback tone, don't make too much eye contact or loom, and get her outside as quickly but calmly as possible. Going after her to give her pets seems to set it off, though not if I just leave my hand in one place and she rubs against it to get pet. I wonder if this started happening after the holidays because your dog got used to going out more frequently, or maybe because the switch to the schedule is making him feel a little insecure after he got used to having so much bonding time with you. My dog is definitely more insecure on Mondays, after she's gotten used to having me around all weekend to hang out with. :)"

Also, should have mentioned this earlier, but make that puppy work for everything if you can, no more puzzle toys unless you can't get the training time in for some reason. Dog food kibbles make excellent treats for a hungry puppy, he gets those when you're doing your training time, with some higher value treats every once in a while. ""No free lunch."" You can do some of this simultaneously while walking him as well. Your husband needs to be helping out with this too, not just exercising him.

Dogtraining,fdto4du,t3_emlk3p,1578719599.0,"Couple thoughts. First, this is relatively normal puppy behavior. Puppies have needle-sharp teeth expressively for the purpose of biting the hell out of each other and learning how hard is too hard. Unfortunately, people are made of thinner skin, so these bites can be quite painful while the puppy is still learning how to use their mouth in social situations. They also have a lot of energy, and hounds in particular have a lot of it. I have to say, I think it was selfish and bone-headed of your husband to foist this dog on you. You are doing a LOT more work with this dog than he is, on top of taking care of three young children and working. A puppy was not the right choice, a hound was not the right choice, and his dream gets to take a backseat to the reality that he helped create. That might mean rehoming the dog, it might mean seeking a dog walker or trainer for the evenings. It actually might be easier to find a dog walker in the evening, maybe an enterprising high schooler in your area who would take the pup off your hands for 30 minutes and wear him out?

I think you're right to be crating him when he gets like this. There's no getting through to them once they reach that state of being wound up. Your dog is not being damaged by not spending time with the whole family at once, he gets lot of attention, training and exercise from you already. Hopefully (if you are not truly ready to throw in the towel) he will soon calm down into an adult version that your children enjoy being around, and then he can form deeper emotional bonds with them. Right now you all just have to survive his rampaging. I know it's hard, but try not to take it personally that he bites during these times, no more than you would it personally when a baby poops on you or your toddler screams at you. He's a baby too, he's still learning, and his body is so full of energy and stupid puppy brain.

For training, I would back off of learning brand new tricks every week. Figure out what basics he needs for all of you to stay sane and safe. In my toolkit I would want: go to your crate, go lay down on your bed, down-stay in general, drop it, leave it, look at me when I say your name, come here right now (obviously these are the long human versions, you'll want single command words for them all). You don't need to give him a treat every time he does something. In fact, you shouldn't be. You are a slot machine, not a vending machine. Treats are not the only positive reinforcement, either. Maybe playing with a toy is. Maybe you using a happy voice to tell him how good he is is what he gets this time. Work on making your basics strong and reliable, they are far more important than tricks. Work on the three D's: duration, distance, distraction. Not all at once, work on each separately, in that order. Tricks come later, when he is fun to live with."

You are insisting that you be the expert about something that you have never had to deal with and that she has been dealing with since before she hit puberty. Why can you not trust that she is the expert here? You are being told by many people from many different walks of life that this is not a situation you can control, because it's not even a situation she can control. Creepy men are going to be creepy men. There is often no way to tell at first blush who are creepy men and who are not. Trying to control her, even in the same of keeping her safe, is a creepy man thing to do.

If you want help, ask her what you can do to help. Don't try to give advice because I promise you you have no advice to give that is going to be helpful, and in fact is likely to be hurtful, because you are making it sound like you believe these creepy men are her fault. It's okay to want to help and keep her safe but you are going about it in ways that just make it sound like you think she's a child who has no idea how the world works, as opposed to a grown adult woman who has managed to live her life without your advice up until now.

Do you have any other women you can talk to about this, to prove to yourself that women know what they are talking about and have been conditioned since childhood in how to avoid sexual harassment and assault in a way that you haven't ever had to do? Like a family member or a friend? Because a thread full of redditors clearly isn't getting through."

Women get hit on by men All The Fucking Time No Matter What They Do. They get it walking down the street, sitting on the bus, at the DMV, at the park, at the bar, at the grocery store. It does not matter what they are wearing, how they act, or what they say. Were you just asleep during the #metoo stuff or do you just not believe women when they say that they have experienced sexual harassment?

She is allowed to be a social human being, and your insistence that YOU know more about how she ought to move through the world than she does is controlling as hell. Should she also stop dressing in the clothes that might attract a man? Should she never go out at night without you? She is being very up front with you about what is happening and is putting distance between herself and these men when they make their intentions clear. Ask her what she wants you to do in these situations and then listen to her, do what she asks you to do, and stop thinking you know more than she does. It's conceited and frankly misogynistic."
aww,fdc2dc0,t1_fdbqfdl,1578265735.0,"A few dogs do smile when happy, but it doesn't look like this. It can almost look like a snarl, because the top of the muzzle wrinkles and they show their front teeth--except all the rest of the their body is very clearly overjoyed. I remember watching a dog training show way back when where a dog that did this was given up by its owners because they thought she was aggressive, but she actually just had a ridiculously exaggerated smile (it may have been Cesar Milan, and fuck that guy in particular, but this was one instance in which he admitted that the dog was perfectly fine and didn't need any of his ""training,"" just more understanding owners).

Anyway, my old dog does this when you come home and let him out of his crate, I want to get a picture but he's always wiggling and prancing too fast to capture it. Wrinkles his face and shows his front teeth and runs around sneezing and wiggling."
todayilearned,fd43osf,t1_fd3daul,1578164113.0,The only edit I would add is that the project yells at you EVEN WHEN YOU ARE DOING IT RIGHT. The project requires some boundaries to help it become a fully functioning adult and also just to not kill itself and the project HATES YOU for being the creator and enforcer of those boundaries. Sometimes it hates your for doing exactly the thing it asked you to do. It can feel so thankless and isolating if you aren't cut out for it.
actuallesbians,fcmjkl2,t1_fcmba0o,1577777895.0,"Hell yeah, that's the spirit! I promise you're not the first or last to do such a thing, haha. Last time I did this I ended up all the way across town at a pizza place, wandered through the whole place twice looking very confused, until the very nice cute queer waiter had to tell me that I was in fact 24 hours early. They were very kind to not make fun of me when I showed up the next day too.

Anyway for sure tell everyone all about it, get some laughs, and look damn fine in public one way or another."
