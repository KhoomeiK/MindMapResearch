depression,ff4zkwc,t3_eroa32,1579576275.0,"Apathy from depression is definitely a thing.  From what you're saying it sounds like your partner made a general criticism about gratitude.  

Emotions can explain our actions, but they don't excuse them.  Having said that, we need the people in our lives to meet us halfway.  If someone said to me that I should be grateful that my life isn't worse, or grateful because someone else is suffering more, that doesn't help.  We can know ourselves, care about others, and still be really depressed.  

There's no forcing yourself to flip a switch.  But you can ask yourself if either you or your partner are talking past each other or not giving each other the benefit of the doubt.  You can also decide how much energy you want to invest in being consciously grateful.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy helped me a bit in this regard because of its mindfulness component.  I've become someone who says ""thank you"" a lot more.  

You sound like you're being a little hard on yourself.  Here's wishing you a peaceful evening."

When you say you think you might not be here for the right reasons, maybe there are no right reasons.  It also sounds like you're comparing yourself to some folks in your family.  You're pretty hard on yourself.  I can relate to that, doing a bit of trash talking toward yourself can almost feel comfortable when you're depressed.  I've also known from a young age that I didn't want to be a parent so if marriage and kids are something you're serious about, good for you.  But you don't have to be a parent to live a fulfilling life or be a decent person.

You mentioned trying to get to the gym or improve your nutrition.  It can be super hard to do that when you're depressed, but you deserve to feel good about yourself.  I know there are times when I'm low and fitness just falls off.  Over the years I've gotten better at being kind to myself.  Even if I'm depressed and think I'm worthless, by body needs good food everyday.  But I had a lot of help to get to that point.

Wanted to add that the older I get the better I understand that I was anxious for a long time, I just worked very hard to ignore it for most of my life.  It took years to get in touch with what anxiety is actually like in my body, if that makes sense.  So not only can it hit you at any age, you could be better tuned into your body at a particular age/time.

depression,felquvr,t3_eptmly,1579228717.0,"Good on you for finding a treatment program. That’s a big thing. People have different ways of making their way through problems. Knowing yourself well enough to recognize the structure of the workbook helps is good insight.  

Having a marriage evolve into a mostly co-parenting relationship must be difficult. Even if everything in someone’s life were squared away, like even if there’re no money worries or health problems, kids are a lot of work. It’s exhausting and it’s natural to put their needs ahead of your own. When you add to the basic being there for the kid every day (you know the bits of energy that go into everything from helping them stay clean and fed to making sure their school work is squared away), when you add to that being depressed and feeling stress at work … that’s incredibly hard.

Defining your marriage might be something you explore in therapy, or not. Maybe your personal recovery is separate from your relationship. It sounds like you’re on different pages with regard to parenting style and finances. These are huge areas that probably need to be addressed to get the most out of your relationship. Some of the differences might be misperceptions that can get brought into alignment with better communications. Other differences you might be able to learn to live with or each make changes. People want recognition for the good they do in the context of a relationship. Family/couples therapy could be a vehicle for getting clearer communication, but it’s easy for me to sit here and suggest that.  

From the outside looking in, and with respect to how stressed you seem, I’m hopeful that you’re concerned about the state of things. Worrying about your marriage could give you enough time to make the moves that build a stronger relationship. Glad you’re doing the work. All the best to you."

depression,fekjnrv,t3_epn1ei,1579201442.0,"This hits home because I took a meandering path to my degree and did apply to medical school only to decide I didn't want to do it.  I thought I was an older student in my 20s but when I told my advisor I was worried about this he said, ""The goal isn't to be a doctor before you're thirty.  It's to have been a doctor for a few years before you're 35.""  

Your MCAT scores are good for five years so if you take it an hit it out of the park you can wait to apply or apply and defer.  Also doing post-bacc courses to boost your GPA is super common, cannot overstate it.  

There are some free medical schools in the US.  I imagine they are all fiercely competitive.  There are also D.O. programs and medical schools in the Caribbean islands or Mexico.  You do a fifth year pathway with your residency in the US but this is a respected path to become a physician.  The cost is messed up, I wish I had some magic to sprinkle on the situation.  

There is also no rule that says you have to be a doctor.  It's okay to seek out something that fits you like a slipper as opposed to fixating on what you think you should be.  That's a huge question and maybe we spend our whole lives answering it.  Or maybe I'm projecting and your commitment is different from mine.

The professionals I know now in my 30s weren't perfect.  Even the ones who went straight through school an into their chosen fields had their hardships.  Struggling with depression doesn't disqualify you from your future."
depression,feki9qf,t3_epnha6,1579200607.0,"It sounds like you're really fixated on your looks.  Feeling that you are conventionally unattractive can be real or perceived.  Bear with me for a moment, because body dysmorphia and facial dismorphia can warp our expectation of how we're seen by the world.  It's also true that some people have actual disfigurements.  They deserve respect and love but some people react in ways that are judgmental or hurtful.  All that said, the level of self-hatred that it sounds like you're feeling deserves to be addressed in therapy if at all possible.

My experience with seeing people navigate relationships is different from what you're relaying.  If you find someone you can trust in irl, whether it is a therapist or not, you'll give yourself a chance to acknowledge the possibility that looks are not the chief determining factor in finding happiness.

I have had some relief with medication in the past.  Was lucky enough to find a doctor who I could communicate with.  There are so many options for medication it wouldn't make sense to game out what they might suggest.  You can see a doctor and be honest about hesitancy with medication and alcohol use.  IMO most providers want to help so if you're hesitant about medication maybe they have a therapist they usually refer to.

Sometimes medicine doesn't work.  Sometimes it has some effect but not what we're hoping for.  Sometimes it seems like it stops working.  It's not a terrible idea to try medical intervention for the sake of learning how you respond.  You fears are valid, but some people do respond to medication.  With mental health we're vulnerable to stigma even if we're not actively aware of it.  I thought for years that I would be ""cured"" when I no longer needed medication.  This was a wrong-headed idea that I internalized from a family member.  It's hard to let go of these ideas, at least for me so I sympathize with the feeling of worry over needing meds forever.

You don't lose credit for fighting depression if you get help form a doc.

Full disclosure, right now I'm not on meds.  If I tried again I would invest in a genetic test to see what medication I had the best chance to respond to.

americandad,fcouht8,t3_eiafjm,1577841903.0,Surely you mean the black/blue dress.
depression,fcotlau,t3_eibsvh,1577841195.0,This is really positive.  Writing is a great thing to do for yourself and sharing it is really brave.
depression,fcoteru,t3_eibo5d,1577841051.0,"You're not alone thinking that suicide is something to keep as an option.  In a bizarre way telling yourself it's an option can keep you going, if that makes sense?  

It sounds like you worry a lot about being a burden.  It's okay to feel that and that fact that you're thinking about how you affect other people is a positive trait in a person.  

There are times when all I want to do is apologize for exisiting, but a few years ago I tried something different.  I started saying ""thank you"" a lot.  Like, all the time.  For a long time I thought it was dumb but it was something small I could do to feel like less of a burden.

So thanks for sharing.  Wishing you a new year with less shame."
depression,fcosziy,t3_eibp3f,1577840717.0,"It's a positive thing that you try to affirm yourself, telling yourself that you're ok.  It's okay to have doubt too.  It sucks to feel that low.  You aren't alone with these thoughts.  All the best."
nba,fcose5p,t3_eibkjt,1577840271.0,"Not VAR but a narrow application of a system like Cyclops in tennis.  Something that was only applied to the boundary line and that returned near instant results.  

If we're talking pie-in-the-sky maybe a fabric that senses reaction with an outer surface.  You could develop a uniform material that sensed if it was touched by another player."
politics,fc6mzxt,t1_fc6bnde,1577484433.0,This is it right here.  It's about activating voters who skip elections.  There are enough folks out there for this to happen.  It's not about deprogramming cult members or buying into fantasies about safe candidates.  That didn't work in 2004 and it won't work now.
depression,fc4br7v,t3_eg41vh,1577412092.0,Getting help is a project.  You really hit the nail on the head with your list.
depression,fc4blh3,t3_eg4epr,1577411961.0,"You're describing a familiar struggle.  We need more good therapists, the difficulty of getting to see one has a lot to do with where you are, and insurance needs to evolve.

The phone calls are daunting.  You're doing a good thing for yourself by taking this on, it's not easy.  You deserve credit for working the process.

Getting in to see *someone* is what matters.  It's true that you might not click, but you'll have accomplished something by getting to that first appointment.  

I was scared out of my mind to talk to a male therapist.  But in the end I tried and I learned something new about myself.  You know yourself best, so if you know you're saving time and emotional energy by focusing on finding a provider who is a woman, do that.

You can also ask to be placed on cancellation lists and work with your primary doctor to come up with a plan to manage the wait.  My doc at one point prescibed Saphris.  I was on other meds, but Saphris was a self imposed chemical restraint, it was my safety to keep me from hurting myself or others.  

You can do it."
movies,fc48kiw,t3_efww2d,1577409544.0,"This feeling happens to be a lot where I imagine a slightly shorter or more expanded view of a movie.  I'm not about to sit here and say I wouldn't change a frame of OUATIH, but anyone else's version would be different than T's.  As soon as the movie ended I wanted to rewatch it and I'm not tired of it yet.  

I also think I prepared myself to enjoy the movie.  I used to not care if I got spoiled, didn't think it affected me.  But with this movie, I took care to avoid spoilers and even avoid marketing if I could.  Went into the theatre with this one thought, that if T could kill Hitler, he could definitely stop the Manson family from murdering.  

There's also a personal connection in that my mom often speaks of seeing Hollywood Blvd. as a kid and how excited she was to be in California.  

It's a pretty conservative movie in the sense that the hippies are the bad guys and the protagonists know they place in the Hollywood hierarchy.  It's not like all hippies were murderers or something.  There's also some quesitons the movie doesn't definitively answer on screen.  Did Cliff actually kill his wife and does Rick get back into movies?  I think the answer is yes to both, but I can't prove it."
