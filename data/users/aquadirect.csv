getdisciplined,fe8rw9z,t3_eo2gsf,1578929973.0,"My God, that's what I do. I want everything to change at once. In the past, I got all revved up. I even made huge changes! But all that quick ""progress"" only lasted a couple of days. Then I'd get disillusioned and wouldn't even try anymore. Life is the journey, not just the destination - and life happens every day. So small steps are OK! You're going to get older every day anyway, might as well be where you want when you get there!"
