Cruise,ffqfpl5,t1_ffq6rge,1580133240.0,"Costco's lag getting new ships and cruises in their search have pushed me to book directly a few times.  They also were a pain when my cruises were chartered--not enough advocacy on my behalf.  I frequently was updating whomever I was talking to there with the latest news.

Their Costco rebate was sure easy to spend 6 weeks later when it finally came in, though!!"
Cruise,ffqfdyc,t3_eumed0,1580132960.0,"Your friend doesn't care which cabin they get, so they wait for their <prob Caribbean> cruise to go on fire sale?

Lots of boats in the Caribbean, so it is a good strategy for /them/.  For an Alaskan cruise on NCL, I would personally book a balcony on Bliss, so I would book as early as possible.  I took my husband on RCI to celebrate him getting his Masters, so I got a specific Grand Suite (limited inventory on a smaller boat) at a better price via booking VERY early.

Budget Queen on Cruise Critic does multiple Alaskan cruises a year, and jumps on good deals when she finds them.  She lives at the port and isn't picky about the cruise line or the cabin.  You have a time of year AND a specific cruise line chosen, so your options are more limited.

Check cruisefish or cruiseplum to see pricing histories for what scope you have in mind.  Balconies for Alaska hit $5k rather quickly."
