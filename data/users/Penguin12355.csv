Hell, a few weeks ago I ordered pizza and those damn parmesan bites that I might likely sell my soul for. Accidentally (I have no idea what I was thinking), I ordered 3 orders. Now, it's just me and my kids, and no one in the house is going to eat that many parm bites. I paid by card so I called the store when I realized it and told the person who answered. Of course, my luck, that person was new and had no idea what to do in this situation. The poor kid on the phone sounded so frazzled, so I said, ""look, this is probably an extenuating circumstance that you won't have to deal with often, so is there someone else I can talk to and explain the situation to?"" Gladly he gets someone on the phone, happened to be the shift manager. I explained the situation and because it was paid by card it couldn't be removed. They'd have to cancel the whole order, refund it, and start over (seriously Domino's, get an easier way to correct these situations!). He told me, ""We don't have to send 3 orders, just next time you order, call in and let us know and we will send the rest when you order."" Well, my memory is shit, so I told him I would never remember to do that, so just don't worry about it and give the bites to someone, or just don't make them, whatever the case, just don't worry about it. He, of course, asked if I was sure, and I said absolutely because it was my mistake. Apparently there are no free meals from this franchise, and the manager was working a double, and I guess I fed him because I ordered a pizza for my kids last night, and he delivered it personally to thank me (which I hadn't even remembered about it, but I guess he had).

Private or not, the school has to have insurance. It happened on school grounds, so the school is liable. The principle isn't making enough effort to get to the bottom of it, fine. Let her pay, I promise it's not coming out of her pocket. Your parents realize the gravity of the situation, they are going to have to pay for something they have no control over. If you are on their insurance, their rates will go up if they take accountability for this. I am not going to go so far as to say you or the school are assholes, but someone needs to own up to this, and it needs to be the school.
