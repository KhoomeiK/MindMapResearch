Games,fek5z3t,t3_epkyc5,1579193312.0,"Plague tale was not a good game in my book. Every single level was just hiding to get past very easy NPC enemies. I would get past that if the game had great characters and story. However, the main character and child have an extremely unnatural dialogue all the time.

The emotional atmosphere changes on a whim, such as in one level (slight spoilers) where you are chased by a swarm of the infected rats, get into a basement, and you're suddenly happy that the young alchemist teaches you fire stone throwing. Theres literally man eating cursed rats hissing at you in the corners of the room, and the main character is just so pleased to receive sparky rocks.

I cleared the entire game in about 3 hours. The pros is that the gameplay is pretty smooth and the environments are well crafted with very detailed textures and lighting. The game was absolutely gorgeous and the player models were also 10/10. But it really really bugs me that others review it as this ""amazing story"" and ""unforgettable experience""  One reviewer on steam said ""this game will make you laugh and cry"". I did neither. The beginning of the game makes you feel on edge and they did really well with the ""inquisition"" coming through, but after that it's just yesterday's paper. Nothing ever changes from that point forward. 

One criticism I've heard of the game is that the studio wasn't trying to make a game, they we're trying to make a movie. I agree with that sentiment, and you can tell they did REALLY try to make some involving gameplay, but just ran out of either ideas to spice up the game or technical constraints. Again, the graphics, lighting, and player movement is really pleasant and never unimmersed me, but even being immersed in the game, I just felt like the characters we're an inch deep, and flip flopped their personalities so very much. The main character kills a big bad guard boss type NPC and shows next to zero remorse and her kid brother is like ""y did u kill that man"", hardly alarmed that you bludgeoned a man to death with a rock. If they took more of a last of us approach and really got some good voice acting and facial expressions, it'd skyrocket the games sense of realism SO much that I would easily rate it a 8/10.

I went into this game excited as hell too because of the reviews and the sweet discount, but really was disappointed. 4/10 game overall."
Games,fek4idc,t1_fek4907,1579192437.0,"for sure, I think it's the bad character personalities and poorly English scripted dialogue that does me in. Kind of like most dubbed anime, the mannerisms and dialogue is unnatural and unrealistic. which would be fine if the gameplay made up for it, but fire emblem never did it for me. Dragon quest was much better in that regard."
