news,ffpa0oc,t1_ffmgnk6,1580089882.0,"Chemical splash goggles are sold in the home improvement section. It’s what’s used in micro labs, I still have mine from classes. Like $2 at walmart. Pass it on"
parrots,ffox5yt,t3_eudo3a,1580082885.0, Alright now I *have* to watch it
China_Flu,ffk74pa,t1_ffk724z,1580018000.0,The original commentor’s figure was dead over infected. My initial reply was dead over cured. This guy reminded me of the true formula though (dead over (dead + cured))
China_Flu,ffjpz1v,t1_ffjppdv,1580004007.0,"You’re cool. Just figured I’d clear up confusion cause if I mistook it as a mortality calculation, others probably will too."
China_Flu,ffjofn1,t3_eu01yy,1580002972.0,"So the united states CDC recommends having supplies on hand at all times, not just for disasters like these, but a lot of people can’t afford to always be prepared or don’t make time for it. Here are some of the things they recommend combined with some things I would recommend:

Hand-crank radio: needs no batteries, keeps you updated in the event of power-loss

Water for 2 weeks (this is a tall order but can at least be considered a long-term goal)

Food for 3 days.
Things like rice, beans, canned food, dried food, and some level of comfort food.

First aid supplies like rubbing alcohol, gauze, bandages, anti-inflammatories, general things like that

Make sure you have your prescriptions filled and your car topped off with gas. 

If you have pets, make sure to stay stocked on their food. 

I’m sure I’m forgetting some things but that’s what I can offer right now."
China_Flu,ffjms1t,t1_ffjmg0f,1580001856.0,Ahhhhhh thank you I knew something wasn’t adding up. Will edit. Sorry it’s been awhile since my epidemiology classes.
China_Flu,ffjlx94,t1_ffjk621,1580001276.0,Actually true mortality rate is number of dead divided by (number of dead plus number of cured). At this stage that number is wildly inaccurate
Pandemic,ffib30t,t3_etrwg9,1579969627.0,"The problem is no one knows right now. But the threat at least seems to be very possible. The info we’re getting swings between factual but possibly censored to alarmist to outright exaggerated and fake. We as individual people can’t be expected to parse out the difference ourselves, but as a community we can focus on verified news sources and help stop misinformation. Panic itself can be deadlier than the cause of the panic. As my global health teacher always said: Stay calm. Stay informed. Don’t underestimate a pathogen."
news,ffdvq8v,t1_ffd620u,1579830113.0,Can I get a source on that 1:17 Ro? Doing my best to amass all info I can but I haven’t heard of that one yet.
draconiagame,ffcit7b,t1_ffcimia,1579800373.0,"Yeah like I said my only real complaint is where the string sits. It just needs to be father back, on the tips of the bow. Both for realism and design aesthetic. It’ll look nicer that way."
