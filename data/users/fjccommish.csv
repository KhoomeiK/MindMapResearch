If the number of dots is evenly divisible by the number of dots Shannon counts to eliminate, then the pattern will keep repeating.

A, C and D are out because 90 is evenly divisible by 3, 5, and 6.

Try 4, starting at dot 90, count and eliminate 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30...60...90 pattern repeats.  4 is out.

Each drawer holds 7.5 inches, and each folder is .45 inches.  7.5/.45 = 16.something.  So 16 folders fit per drawer.

3/(x\^2 - 9) = 3/(x-3)(x+3)

6/(x\^2 + 3x - 18) = 6/(x+6)(x-3)

The common denominator is (x+6)(x-3)(x+3):  Eliminate A, C, and D

C's denominator factors to (x-3)(2x+9)

The only part of the denominator missing in the first fraction is (x+6):  3(x+6) = 3x+18

The only part of the denominator missing in the second fraction is (x+3):  6(x+3) = 6x+18

Add the numerators:  3x+18 + 6x + 18 = 9x + 36.  That's E

You can also try a number for x.  Plug it into the original expression and the answer choices.  x=2, for example, only matches the original expression with E.

60  Exponents and Radicals UG2 (2.14)	

Try to get the exponents with the same denominator:  1/3 and 5/4 has 12 as a common denominator.

1/3 = 4/12 and 5/4 = 15/12. so it's x\^(4/12) \* y \^ (15/12)>

That's the 12throot of (x\^4 \* y\^15) 

You can remove x or y to 12's.  Subtract from the power.

y\*12throot(x\^4 \* y\^3)

You could also pick numbers for x and y.  Compare the original expression to the answer choices.  You may have to try different numbers until you eliminate all but one answer choice.

SATACTprep,ffjsse6,t3_eqsyy0,1580005968.0,"Yes.  I have students who were flagged because of it, and CB or ACT demanded proof of not cheating.  In every case, the student (family) sent in proof of prep and a lot of other material demanded.  In every case, CB and ACT made them re-take the test - get a certain score, and their original higher score would be certified.

For example, one student scored 15 three times.  After working hard including me tutoring him, he raised the score to a 28.  His family sent in all the information, but he still had to re-take the test.  He needed a minimum of a 24 for ACT to reinstate his 28.  He scored 26 on that next test, and his 28 was reinstated/certified.

However, if they accuse you of cheating, first demand their proof.  It's not up to you to prove your innocence.  It's up to them to prove your guilt.  There was a case of a student accused of copying from another student - her answers were ""too similar"" to the answers of another student.  However, she was the only person in the room the day she took the test.  Of course answers are going to be similar - the more you get right, the more similar answers you have with others who score high.  Also, students tend to miss the same questions because some questions are harder than others.

Mark the distance 1000 on your answer sheet. Use it as a ruler to measure the unknown length line. The unknown line is around 800.

Use the calculator to find the value of A-E. Only D is close to 800 (it's 815).

I used a PDF measure tool to calculate, via measuring, the length in question. It came out to the exact value of answer choice D.

Use Law of Sin to find a side length when you have one angle and the length opposite it, and another angle (opposite the unknown side).

(sin 110) / 1000 = (sin 50) / x

AskTrumpSupporters,fffjsw3,t1_fff3e2w,1579885488.0,"Trump didn't withhold aid.  The deadline for sending the aid was Sept 30.  The aid was in Ukraine's hands on Sept. 12.

Trump did not have to send aid by that deadline.  Throughout history, Presidents have made decisions about Congressionally allocated funds - spend it, not spend it, when to send it.  Jefferson was the first to do that.  Obama did it.

It is the duty of a President to ensure funds are spent correctly and that aid isn't sent so that the aid goes into the pockets of corrupt people.  The U.S. and Ukraine also have a treaty to mutually investigate corruption.

The corruption involved Hunter and Quid Pro Joe Biden.  It is central to the issue, so we should hear from them.  If someone is accused of murder, but someone else committed the murder, then that someone else's testimony is taken in the murder trial.  The question of whether there was corruption is important.

Pencil Neck Schiff read into the Congressional record, before his committee, a transcript of the Ukraine call supposedly revealed by the Fakeblower.  The next day, after GEOTUS had released the real transcript, Pencil Neck claimed he had been doing a ""parody"" of the call.  In addition, again before Congress, Pencil Neck lied about he or his staff having been in contact with the Fakeblower prior to him filing his complaint.  The Fakeblower's testimony is important since his complaint is the basis of the impeachment, and since it appears there was coordination between Schiff (his staff) and the Fakeblower prior to the filing (second) filing of the complaint.

Not one of the witnesses the Dems called during the House hearings could testify that they heard Trump or ""anyone in this universe"" say there was an expectation of something in return for the aid (which was sent early - before the deadline.)  The only person who placed conditions on Ukraine aid was Quid Pro Joe Biden."
