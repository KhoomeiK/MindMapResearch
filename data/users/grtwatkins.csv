You know how you can usually pick out someone saying your name in a loud crowd? Or when someone you don't know is having casual conversation on the other side of the restaurant and addresses someone at the table who happens to have the same name as you, and even though you couldn't hear their quiet conversation you caught your name being said clear as day? That's because your brain picks up your name (or radio callsign) and knows that someone is addressing you even if you aren't actively listening.


When someone starts by saying that they are calling you, even if you aren't actively paying attention, your brain catches it and snaps to attention just in time to hear the next line, which tells you who it is that's calling."
