For example, before starting my new job I was hypomanic and needed a wardrobe.  I spent a lot of money, yes, but I needed it.  I wasn’t shy about asking store reps for help.  I did a ton of research as I only ever had a job where I wore a uniform.   I got exactly what I needed and look great for work.  Now I get noticed in a positive way.  

Then there is the Ikea trips, those have really helped me improve my living space.  I’m more organized.  

Oh!  And of course my doggo.  Natsu helps keep me sane and gives me something to cling to.  Now if i have suicidal thoughts I think of my dog and how I couldn’t leave him.  

That doesn’t make up for all the hyper-sexuality and bad decisions.  But, sometimes, things work out and you can actually get what you need.  If that thing is a roomba that helps you keep your house clean while in the depths of despair, than so be it."
