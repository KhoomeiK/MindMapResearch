I sometimes wonder if Sonic had more responsive acceleration at a standstill if it would make the games better in the platforming category. I know this game is all about speed but taking a moment to stop and loot around shouldn’t be a chore to control."
personalfinance,ff3zooc,t3_erfd25,1579552369.0,"What would it take for you to leave, what would it take for you to stay.  Write it down and compare the two columns. Do this before telling anyone, and as you talk to people continue to update the list. Call out the unknowns, worst that can happen, and what likely will happen.

Write down your goals. Write down “the why” behind those goals. Write down different ways to reach those goals.  Write down alternative goals. Try to avoid specific solutions in life,

For example:

Goal: I want to be on the moon.

Why: I like the idea of being in space away from the familiarity of earth.

How: I will become an astronaut.

Or: maybe I will build my own space rocket.

Alternate Goal: I will go somewhere foreign.

Alternate Why: I like the idea of being in a completely different place far from what I am familiar with.

How: I will save up to travel over seas.

The further you can dig into “the why” the more options you give yourself to accomplish your goals.  Changing jobs is a big deal and can help you meet or miss your goals.  That said, a shitty hostile job is a shitty hostile job."

For road trips you’ll have to bump the map view along the travel route and take note of any place that reviews well.  When franchises start to hit the top there’s a reason for that.

I do product management now, so it’s my job to dig into the business and find ways to grow our product.  While I have my areas of focus, there’s not really a limit on what I can try to make a change to—but you have to be diligent about picking your battles and building your case for change.

An arcade stick is for somebody that is a die he’s fighting game fan. Something you get at high levels of play where you really care about input precision and the speed in which you can enter your input.

I recommend playing story mode to get the input basics. It can be a boring slog though, and the Android Arc forces you to play with the same two-person team for way too long.  Arcade is a more entertaining vs. AI experience.  Just be aware the AI fights nothing like human players do."

I would expect an articles that hit the front page like this to at least mention what has changed since the last time this hit the front page.  I thought Warren was rather close to Bernie in terms of support and motivation yet I never see articles mentioning her.

Something like:

Bernie’s Student Debt Forgiveness Program Unifies gains more support than other Candidates Programs.

Bernie’s hard stance against Trump’s military action in Iran has lead to increase in campaign donations.

Bernie and Warren’s policies show greater motivation in supporters to vote than other Democratic candidates in most recent poll.
