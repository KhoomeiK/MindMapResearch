meettransgirls,ffmpao2,t1_ffkbg46,1580057480.0,"Well, despite the name of the sub, there really aren't many trans girls around here. That's on us, and we should be more honest about it. We're mostly trans *women*. We have all the issues of *real women*--being discriminated against, being condescended to, being objectified, raped, beaten, etc.--with the added bonuses of being born the wrong gender and generally having a mortal fear of (and fascination with) mirrors. The vast majority of us who *have* penises (penii?) don't like em.

You might be in luck, though. I'm one of the weirdos who likes the factory-installed bits, so I might trip your trigger. Of course you'll have to get past the age, jawline, shoulders, biceps, yada yada. If you don't have daddy issues now..."

Sticking your whole head into a pile of clean laundry. Catching someone checking you out.

Life is worth living. If you have depression, you'll have to try to find ways to right the chemical fuckups in your head, and that takes time and effort and sometimes *really* sucks during the trial-and-error stage.

questioning,ff916kf,t3_es83sj,1579702253.0,"I would suggest you employ the scientific method. Experiment. You're young and just figuring out what you like. It's kind of silly to get rid of half the menu without even trying it. Girls are yummy. Worst case scenario is that you'll figure out you don't like playing with girls. It's kind of like trying a new kind of food. You can eat at the same four or five restaurants all your life and know everything that's on the menu. You'll always know what you're getting and it won't disappoint, but it will never be anything amazing, either. Alternatively, you can try the occasional little weird hole-in-the-wall restaurant with food from Whereverthefuckistan. You'll get some meals that are just gross (with the cool side benefit that you get to tell people about how gross it was) but occasionally you'll get something totally amazing that may completely expand your horizons. If it's awful, it was just one meal. If it was amazing you win.

One thing I can tell you for absolute certain: If you think there's *any* chance you might enjoy experimenting with girls, do it. Give it a fair trial, too; don't just try it once and say, ""Ew."" Some things are an acquired taste. Avocados. Caviar. Sushi. Speaking from sad experience, I can tell you that it's one of life's great sadnesses to look back from your fifties and realize just how much fun you passed up because of decisions you made out of youthful ignorance."

There aren't many feelings in the world that compete with ""dress go spinny,"" but being trans day-to-day is a full-on dumpster fire emotionally, socially, medically, and financially.
