germanshepherds,ffgfcf0,t1_ffgexrm,1579904971.0,"Thank you! She's just under that currently at 21"". She may still get a little taller, who knows! And no, no papers for this girl. She came from a rough situation and we're still working daily to help reset her so her first 8 weeks don't affect her next 8 years."
germanshepherds,ffgbv09,t1_ffg9dwg,1579902806.0,"That's one huge reason why I'm glad she's lean! I think I'll be worried about her hips/elbows until I get them checked out. But I give her supplements, the correct exercise, don't overfeed her, etc."
germanshepherds,ffgbpdd,t1_ffgb4l9,1579902710.0,"The vets never say anything about her weight/body type. So I assume she's good! People have definitely mentioned that to me lately, filling out. Just not sure what it actually would look like on my girl."
germanshepherds,ffgbfn4,t1_ffg3zx5,1579902544.0,Ohhh my god YES. She loves to sit and lay on me and I end up bruised. She'll put all 60lbs on me through her boney ass elbows
germanshepherds,ffg3sok,t1_ffg3dls,1579897840.0,I know that females are usually smaller than males. So I didn't expect her to be huge and frankly I think she's the perfect size as she can still sit on my lap!
germanshepherds,ffg1v8c,t1_fffzkkm,1579896652.0,I saw the video of them wrestling on you! I have a giant husky. I got so used to mine that when I see a small one I think awh a baby! But it may be full grown. It's just not a giant like mine! I think that's what's happening here. Bc she's the right height and length and everything. Maybe people are just used to seeing huge GSD's
Dogtraining,fffgx15,t3_etalzo,1579883710.0,"If we see a ""nervous"" dog lead or harness or a do not pet, etc. We stay away! I do NOT let my dogs greet it. I don't even make eye contact with the dog. If someone feels the need to order the labeling harness/lead and put it on the dog, I take it as a serious warning. Bc I also have a nervous dog now. And that's how I want people to interact with her. Especially if she's on a lead. She feels kinda trapped in the situation so her only option in her brain is to lash out."

Dogtraining,ffccmmh,t3_estevw,1579796565.0,"My first dog was an absolute demon for the first few years. I learnt to get a better trash can, even better if you can put it in a cabinet under the sink.(so long as they can't open cabinets) And you really can't leave food out. Have a meeting with your roommates and ask them to please help you with that. If they're not assholes, they should be able to at least try to not leave their plates at easy access points. Otherwise, just know, they turn into seniors. Your pup will slow down in the future and it'll kill you. I remember when my old demon didn't get up when the pizza came. Cried so bad I couldn't eat. So just hang in there and use this as a time to practice the whole slow to anger quick to forgive thing. It'll get better as long as you keep working with him! It sounds like you're trying extremely hard and it will pay off."
Dogtraining,ffalop4,t3_esinz9,1579738866.0,"I have a GSD who barks at basically anything she thinks is weird. Of course she has her bark command. But she also has a ""quiet"" command. When she stops barking, I tell her good quiet! Give her a treat. I never yell at her for barking though. Sometimes I tell her ""that's enough"". For us, it works to just have a command that signifies stop barking. When I'm not home, I don't know what happens but I haven't received any complaints of excessive barking."

science,ff8130l,t3_erw0p7,1579663226.0,"I was in solitary my entire jail stay which was luckily only 3 days. But lemme tell ya, 3 days alone made me weird as hell. When I got out, I was afraid to speak out loud, riding in the car scared me, I couldn't handle being alone. Years later, I still have to constantly have some kind of background noise. I only cried bc I missed my dog and was worried he was scared. But when I was in solitary, it was Winter in NC. So it was cold af. Sleeping on a steel cot, being stripped and only having the turtle suit, they even took my glasses. I can't say if it would have been better if I wasn't in solitary and I hope to never find out. They put me in there bc the officers wouldn't get my medication. I wasn't being bad or a snitch or anything. Just have mental shit that's genetic. And now I'm absolutely even worse as far as social interactions go. I can't even watch the Kalief Browder Story. I think it's one thing if you fear for your safety and go to solitary, that's kinda a personal choice. But to just put people in there for whatever reason and leave them. It's completely inhumane. I wouldn't even do it to an animal."
Dogtraining,ff73pe7,t1_ff6jlqs,1579640499.0,"We just got back! They did a fecal exam and checked for parasites. Asked if there was any blood in his stool and I said no. They said to give him fortiflora and metronidazole. Sent us home with the metronidazole and I ordered the fortiflora on amazon. The vet said it should be better in 48 hours, if not, bring him back in. As long as he still has an appetite and is drinking water they think it's not a big deal. Probably just ate something he shouldn't have or a virus."
Dogtraining,ff6pc22,t1_ff6jlqs,1579632069.0,"We have the collapsing crate. I just block him into the kitchen at night. Keeps the mess away from the carpet, I can hear his feet on the floor in there, and I feel like he's less inclined to potty there bc then he's stuck with it right by him. It's not so bad on him but definitely cuts down his freedom of where he can potty. We live in a not great area and just had a huge swat raid in our building 2 nights ago. Luckily, my senior is well adjusted to the rowdy life. But his baby sister has needed her thundershirt a lot more lately.   


My pup is on a few medications so I often worry about him having issues with one of those. I just know nothing has really changed. I feed my pups at a set time, they clean their bowls, bowls go up, we go out 2 more times before bed. It's a routine. So for him to now suddenly be pooping in the middle of the night, there's definitely something wrong. And the vet said to bring him in because it's been longer than 24 hours. Not sure what they'll do test wise but I'll let you know!"
Dogtraining,ff6huqo,t3_erwuze,1579627526.0,My dog is in the same boat but he's a senior. Poop accidents 2 nights in a row and he hasn't had an accident in 9 years. We're going to the vet in 2 hours. I'll report back with what we're told!
90DayFiance,ff6c2mp,t1_ff69cdl,1579623928.0,"I think she wanted to make him feel bad for getting hurt/upset.. her apology, if she ever gave one, would go something like ""I'm sorry if you felt that way but you just misinterpreted me"""
germanshepherds,ff6bs5m,t1_ff5zxh8,1579623742.0,"If it wasn't for mine being glued to my hip 24/7, even at the park.. I'd have a tough time too. But she stays under me, sitting on my feet, or on my lap. If another pup did that she'd get nasty with em"
germanshepherds,ff54yfh,t3_erngnj,1579580367.0,"Different is a good thing! If all our dogs looked the same, we'd have a hell of a time knowing which is which.

Dogtraining,feyx437,t3_eqrxtd,1579451548.0,"Had to yell at a lady in Lowe's bc she insisted on befriending my nervous GSD. The lady noticed she was scared and said ""awh she doesn't like that cart"". I told her no, she doesn't like strangers. The lady kept on trying to baby talk her and lean down and get closer and I had to yell at her. ""YOU'RE A STRANGER AND SHE DOESN'T LIKE STRANGERS"". I ended up having to tell her she doesn't even like eye contact. I just wish people understood like just bc most dogs like you, doesn't mean ALL dogs will. We're working so hard to show her that strangers aren't scary and you just set us back for your selfish entitled desires."
DoggyDNA,fewcvi2,t3_eqm4w1,1579408530.0,I added a video so you can see him in motion! Big boy! He's considered geriatric by the vet and has arthritis so his fetch game is a little weak.

If she's got a prey drive too, which wouldn't be surprising, yikes! Even with recall down for absolute certain, make sure she's microchipped.

Dogtraining,fene03g,t1_fend67p,1579282658.0,"I'm just a little paranoid about keeping my girl lean. Her husky brother has arthritis and I don't want to see her struggle like he does. I've had her on joint supplements since 8 weeks and put fish oil on both of their food. We utilize the leave it command for food time. Nobody touches the food until I say so. She ate in her crate until she was about 8 months old! If it works for you, keep doing it! You know your pup, y'all live together 24/7."
Dogtraining,fenciwm,t3_eq0f88,1579281762.0,Check out the snuffle mat! We used it for feedings and put a couple treats too. My GSD has such a serious sense of smell that she loved being able to find all the food. Made eating take a little longer too! Using food they don't get extra calories either. It's a good way to stimulate the pup without it potentially hurting the joints.

It's supposed to be good for joints. My old boy has been big his whole life and seeing him struggle to stand up about killed me. But I helped him lose over 20lbs and now he can even play again! He's also on pain medication and anti inflammatory for his arthritis. I've been giving my GSD pup the supplements since she was 8 weeks old. When I got her she seemed badly bred.

When we go near randoms and she gets nervous, I just tell her ""good girl, you're okay"". I'm her advocate so it's up to me to tell people she's scared. Usually I ask people to just ignore her. When she sniffs them I tell her she's a good girl. Seems small but for her, it's huge. It kinda builds her confidence. At first she had no idea what really anything meant. Even ""no"".. she had no idea. But now she knows like reassuring tones and trusts me to keep her safe. We still go to places like today we went to a pet store and Lowe's.

AskCulinary,fdfkj4m,t3_el3ehx,1578363838.0,"I ordered the sodium citrate! After I make my roux and add milk, then add a couple grams of the sodium citrate, then the cheese? How much for like 2 cups of milk?"

AskCulinary,fdfflmm,t1_fdff42v,1578360550.0,"That may be an issue i'm running into, baking it too much. I'll try taking the pot off the heat and then adding the cheese. My burner usually stays really hot even after turning it off"
AskCulinary,fdffdw5,t1_fdfck6b,1578360408.0,I'm not really sure if i'm adding too much starch or not. I just add bacon grease or butter and about an even amount of flour. Cook the raw flour taste out and then start adding my milk.
AskCulinary,fdff9dp,t1_fdfc95x,1578360323.0,I usually just use whole milk but if I don't have that I'll use heavy cream or even evaporated milk. I'm getting mixed messages on turning the heat off or leaving it on but I have been turning it off so I think next time I'll leave it on.
AskCulinary,fdff4im,t1_fdfcbfl,1578360232.0,"That's what I've been doing, turning the heat off and then adding the cheese. And I never buy pre shredded cheese. Always shredded on the bigger side of the grater."
Dogtraining,fdeq7jr,t3_eku965,1578344324.0,Depends on the dog and weather imo. My husky/malamute mix 1000% doesn't need clothes. Short haired GSD pup loves her adidas tracksuits. She's able to play outside for much longer with it on.
Dogtraining,fdady7b,t3_ekc4ku,1578245015.0,"My family used to call me bulldog and nobody ever wanted to wake me up. Even as a toddler I woke up swinging. It's much better to use good scents and sounds. Like put a piece of rotisserie chicken in front of her and say ""good girl"" in a very soft voice. You can even find a crinkly bag of treats and get her well trained that that sound means GOOD THINGS HAPPENING."
