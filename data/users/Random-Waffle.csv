depression,ffss3cf,t1_ffsrpca,1580190436.0,"I don't know who you are. But I just want to say thank you. I just looked through some of the other comments and saw that you are the one who posted the first post asking how people are doing, then you are being a friend to everyone here who needs one. Thank you."
depression,ffsrmxq,t1_ffsrfeb,1580189993.0,sure
depression,ffsrcee,t1_ffsr8zo,1580189715.0,Maybe
depression,ffsr35h,t1_ffsqxfa,1580189476.0,Why is that? Why is it easier to talk to someone you don't know on the internet then someone you do know?
depression,ffsr17d,t3_euxyam,1580189424.0,No your all good. After this conversation we probably won't ever talk again and we don't know each other. So it's fine
depression,ffsqt0a,t1_ffsqodd,1580189211.0,Yeah.
depression,ffsqk51,t1_ffsqb1b,1580188976.0,I don't care that no one has an interest in me. At this point I just want to be left alone.
depression,ffspp87,t3_euxyam,1580188181.0,"Terrible. All I have lately is bad days. I'm sad angry all the time. I love my family but most of the time now I fell more like I hate them and everyone around me. I have no one to talk to and when ever I have tried to talk with people. They look like they just want the conversation to end and forget about and they understand nothing. So I'm trying something new. Don't talk to anyone and hate everyone!

Edit: I hate my fucking life"

depression,fdwv9te,t3_en7336,1578762665.0,"I don't think anyone of us wants depression, but life with out depression is a lot scarier for us then life with depression. I don't know life any other way and it very hard to change to a new life."
