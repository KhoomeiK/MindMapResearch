They were both suspended.

2) I got walking around at lunch banned in my elementary school (5th grade), this girl didnt like me so we planned to fight that day at recess, recess got canceled because of the rain, she started threatening me and telling my friends who told me, I walked over and pulled one of her braids off her head. We both got suspended for three days. 

3) Baseball at recess, my bestfriend got baseballs banned, he and  his  friend were playing catch, he play baseball and hes a good pitcher, he threw the ball, the other guy didnt catch it, it hit a lunch monitor, nobody knew who threw it, nobody really did anything. My friend threw the ball again, other guy didnt catch it hit the glass window on a door, the ball got stuck, not a single person snitched on who did it, his friend shoved the glove in one of the lost and found lunch boxes. He waited till the say when they throw out all the lost and found stuff to go get it."
