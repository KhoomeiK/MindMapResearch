OldSchoolCool,ffb9emx,t1_ffb9548,1579756043.0,I was making a joke at your expense. You probably didn't realize it was a jab at you though because of your poor reading comprehension and even worse social skills. I assure you that no one reading this exchange would label me the fool.
OldSchoolCool,ffb8t2b,t1_ffb8eik,1579755374.0,"No I'm not serious you fucking jackass. No one is even arguing that the red in redneck has anything to do with communism. You just saw the big bad C word and flipped your shit. The original poster was saying that rednecks (often a term used to describe rural white Americans) have very communal values because of how their small society works. You actually know your neighbor and are probably drinking buddies because shit there ain't anyone else around. Next time instead of getting scared of the words how about you try to read and understand them so you can have an actual conversation. Hell it may even make you, dare I say it, more communal."
OldSchoolCool,ffb805n,t1_ffb7haw,1579754491.0,Are you serious dude? Why else would they be called REDnecks if it wasn't alluding to the blood red flag of the French working class? Crack a fucking book sometime would ya?

worldnews,fefbnb1,t1_fef8hil,1579052768.0,There are so many immigrants though I feel that it's the losing battle to try and fix it with those reforms. Why does no one target the fucking guy hiring these people. Throw that piece of shit in jail for extorting immigrant workers and giving the shaft to his countrymen. It's easy to paint the foreigner as an evil job stealing monster but no one bats an eye at the man who pulled the rug from under them.
sports,fdytred,t1_fdxyt0q,1578783468.0,Isn't lunging and reaching for the goal line considered a football move? The whole point of the game is to in fact reach the goal line. He made the quintessential football move.
sports,fdkg56o,t1_fdjrhrr,1578503161.0,Yup. I saw Carson Wentz at the Camden aquarium the year Philly drafted him. I couldn't believe how large he was. Didn't even look human next to the regular size people.
worldnews,fdisyxa,t1_fdiphh3,1578450353.0,You think we don't give those titles to men that have issued even worse orders? Are you active service or just have a gavage style feeding tube pumping you full of the Kool aid?
Jokes,fdga5ww,t1_fdg9xy8,1578386739.0,Oh well congratulations I guess?
Jokes,fdg9cx2,t1_fdg14og,1578385643.0,"...not only is this insensitive, it's not funny in the slightest bit."
news,fdg4kmz,t1_fdg2l30,1578379774.0,Nothing went well but botched implies the officer did something out of line to make a routine situation go awry. A botched traffic stop would be like the  Philando Castile shooting. The one presented in the article is clearly not in the same category
todayilearned,fdf90gl,t1_fdf62ba,1578356117.0,"And then there are ""those people"" that cry logical fallacy when one hasnt been committed. If you would take a moment to read more of the conversation instead of just piggybacking to make your little voice heard perhaps you too could contribute something useful. My response even to them saying i was arguing in bad faith wasn't malicious and i agree my pointed questions were biased. It seems as though you offer absolutely nothing but personal attack just for the sake of commenting ."
todayilearned,fdf6ba6,t1_fdf53wa,1578354302.0,"Those are the two broad strokes of the situation. You can choose to help or not help your countrymen at home and you can choose to abstain from or go to war. Those choices were made long ago, we have not helped first responders nearly enough and we have been fighting for quite some time and have killed many more people than we lost. Im not creating a strawman by asking directed questions that are clearly on topic even though my bias is apparent. they are welcome to refute either point and perhaps even have an option im not considering."
todayilearned,fdf3t5e,t1_fdevq4g,1578352664.0,"I'm really curious what ""made right"" in this situation is to you?  are you saying we should celebrate the heroes who helped in such a tragic time or are you supporting 18 years of                                                    fucking off in the middle east fighting groups that we used to sponsor for proxy wars?"
worldnews,fdet3mo,t1_fdestjx,1578346038.0,The power and weight is vastly different though and how you choose to throw it around lies solely at your feet. Do not make light of a billionaire murderer because they are having internal strife. If they are unfit to handle the position responsibly perhaps they should be removed.
worldnews,fdepm99,t1_fden98x,1578343977.0,Yeah some people suffer in that they don't fit in at school and others suffer in their social circles and start wars costing millions of human lives. Pretty much the same thing.

worldnews,fdam6rw,t1_fd7zqu3,1578247601.0,If you sell out your country you should fear the repercussions. If I sacrificed the safety of the people I'm supposed to lead because of a corporations pressure I would hope they'd drag my body through the streets.
worldnews,fd5ob2t,t1_fd5mrap,1578179627.0,I was more speaking to the pawn bit but if corrupt politicians houses started going up in flames perhaps they would think a bit more about the decisions they make. What's one more burned down house to the Australian people?
worldnews,fd5kfdi,t1_fd546ak,1578178496.0,Everyone is a pawn to some degree in their own life. Does someone holding power over you absolve you of all wrong doing? I would argue it absolutely does not.
worldnews,fd5chjs,t1_fd50lkt,1578176252.0,The fundamental reason for employing people is to have a large enough force to accomplish tasks that need more than a single human. I think you meant whats the point of exploiting people?
politics,fcur660,t1_fcu3jxg,1577986829.0,When one person in a company makes hundreds times more than an other employee. Not twice not even ten times as much. But when someone makes as much as you would in two hundred years....
science,fcupi3v,t1_fctwnsa,1577985902.0,"Well if you are just looking for a one night deal sure I could agree. If you are interested in something more substantial I couldn't disagree more. You have to make connections with humans. If meeting new people and hoping to find someone you vibe with feels like you have ulterior motives than you may never find someone. But that's not how humans work. People have had access to dating sites for what 30 maybe 40 years? Before that it's chance encounters, small talk, building a relationship on a shared interest and maybe it develops into something more. Maybe you should shift the focus to being more social in general. Don't worry so much about finding a mate right now just get out there and meet people and maybe you'll like one of them. Or maybe you'll meet someone youre not romantically interested in but they invite you to a gathering that opens up more opportunities. There isn't anything wrong or scummy about wanting to meet new people."
science,fctsga1,t1_fctrq6f,1577957120.0,"I'm starting to think the location isn't the issue... there are nearly limitless places to meet people. Anywhere there is a person is where you may find your next relationship. Two big keys to this are 1. Do things that other people do ( going out to clubs/bars, get involved with a charity, join an organized event kind of group, do anything but stay in your house. And 2. You have to put yourself out there. Say hello to a stranger. Strike up friendly banter. Introduce yourself. 
People aren't going to fall into your arms. And it might feel uncomfortable sometimes for you, them or the both of you but if you never talk to anyone you will never meet anyone"
politics,fcsz2fc,t1_fcsq6jz,1577928698.0,I think they just also want fair wages.
politics,fcsnh2p,t1_fcsi3pq,1577920393.0,"No they do want fair. Being able to amass billions of dollars is seen as unfair and no ""flat tax"" is going to rectify that."
politics,fcsndjr,t1_fcsf059,1577920320.0,A flat tax on unfair wages? What exactly would that fix?

aww,fcatm96,t1_fcaqp42,1577576367.0,What about herding and retrieving. Dogs that have never even seen a farm animal will herd children and the like. Dogs that have never been on a hunt will bring back a thrown toy with an extraordinarily soft touch. How can we write off violence if it is indeed one of these working traits?

AskReddit,fc5z6st,t3_ega9qc,1577468875.0,When at the dumbbell rack please take your weights and then take 5-10 steps back so other people can grab the weights they need. Its really annoying when someone is doing a set of curls while resting their sack on the weights so no one can grab them
funny,fc4ecck,t1_fc41af5,1577414210.0,I live in a house with 3 other people. I also moved in with the biggest TV and offered to put it in the common room with one little stipulation... the stickers and surrounding protective plastic had to stay on
videos,fbv26v0,t1_fbuw51b,1577124181.0,"Is there really any tragedy in phasing out a breed we created? We made a mistake and it's ok to fix it. You don't need a genocide just stop manufacturing the breed. If humans develop an unsafe vehicle they stop it's production, we don't live with the danger because it's too sad to pull the plug on a failed project"
