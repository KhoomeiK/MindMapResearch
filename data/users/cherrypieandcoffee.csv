I did wonder this...but the fact you still heard the clear ""kreg"" examples as ""Craig"" makes me think that it's actually just something to do with hearing variations. Like my Indian colleague says two sounds in Hindi that to me sound identical are different.

I think you're really underestimating crazy, manipulative people's talent for presenting a skewered but believable version of events here.

I mean I agree, the whole thing is ridiculous and OP has every right to feel aggrieved. I just think the bride sounds sufficiently gross for it to not be worth trying to gain any kind of revenge.

Violating their rules might sound like transgressive fun, but I think it's more likely to make you both look petty and vindictive to other guests, and I feel like it's probably ultimately going to leave you feeling shitty too.

I don’t think that’s necessarily entirely or even mostly a negative thing, mind you. Troubled people can be very challenging and if you love someone then you are willing to tolerate more than you would otherwise and you naturally tend to want to try and “solve” their problems. 

But it’s also true that the wild drama and the unexpected outbursts and the rollercoaster of emotions are really addictive - because they are so outlandish and so heightened compared to the rest of everyday life. I came to dread those moments...while also secretly relishing them.
