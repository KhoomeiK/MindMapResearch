 Photography is a good example, a lot of newer cameras do everything for you, taking away the manual controls you need to get familiar with to wrap your head around how everything works. And when you have less of the fancy features to play with, you learn how to do more with less by mastering fundamentals.

bisexual,ff57p7x,t1_ff33tj7,1579582659.0,"Grammatically speaking the text in the image is more correct for the message you're trying to convey.

Being promiscuous or even having slept with both sexes before are not requirements to knowing if you're bi or not. Being monogamous or having multiple relationships in a row with the same gender also doesn't make you not bi.

However, the use of 'anyone' is also a true statement, and grammatically correct, even if it does change the meaning of the statement slightly from what you intend. It would change it to be a slightly more confrontational, ""I don't need to sleep with any one person, male or female, or indeed anyone at all, to prove that I'm bi.""

This is the cream part of ice cream, which is what makes it creamy. It's also expensive. So to keep costs down, they skimp on the cream, to a percentage low enough that it can no longer be legally called ice cream. Hence, ""frozen dairy dessert."" This is also why these products seemingly don't melt in the heat like they should - fat, like butter for example, has a low melting point. These frozen treats don't contain as much fat as the real thing, so they don't melt as readily.

What makes up the difference in volume then? Usually just air and water. Real ice cream that is slowly churned at a consistent temperature creates nice, small, uniform ice crystals which lend to an ice cream's smooth and creamy mouthfeel. It is also denser as churning it slowly allows air to escape and the smaller ice crystals pack down tighter. Inferior product whose making is rushed and not allowed time to stay in place while it's made so the temperature remains constant, will have large, irregular ice crystals that give it a grainy texture. Churning it quicker also beats extra air into the product that is then frozen and trapped in the mix, both of these things together give it more volume but make it less dense. 

Other ways companies may save on costs are to use cheaper corn syrups in place of real sugar, and binders such as lecthin (made from seaweed) to make it feel more solid and dense than it really is.

If you'd like to know more about the differences between expensive and cheap ice creams, I'll refer you to BA's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lma9TNjj_O8"
videos,ff4qebk,t1_ff45aqo,1579569935.0,"That's what makes it legal.

They can make it however they want, but if they don't meet the standards required, then they forfeit the right to legally call it ice cream. Hence why they are labelled ""frozen dairy product"" or ""frozen dairy dessert."" 

P.S. to no one in particular: I once made this point in a Reddit thread, layered with my disdain for the inferior ""frozen dairy *imposter*"" and even singled out Breyers as the main offender to earn my ire, yet was downvoted for being an ice cream snob.  My opinion shall not be swayed - it is a lesser quality product in every way except price, *which is why the price reflects that.*

She changed into a *completely different person* when she was around him. The rebellious, punk, atheist girl suddenly became, ""you're the best daddy! Sure I'd like to go to church with you this Sunday!"" type. It was fucking freaky. She angrily asked afterwards why I didn't make up an excuse as to why she couldn't go with her father, as she warned me it might happen ahead of time, but she was so into it when she agreed to it I thought there's no way that could be an act. Nothing prepares you for something like that.

I mean, that's probably worst-case scenario and we broke up around the time symptoms of her dad's illness (schizophrenia) started to appear in her and combined with other past traumas she had besides, and her getting back into drugs, she really went off the deep end. 

But I guess my point is, kids growing up in constant fear and uncertainty is almost a guarantee for anxiety, stress, and other issues later in life. I do all these things, and it's definitely not out of courtesy for others even if that's probably what I'd tell people if they asked. It's a learned aversion to making any kind of ripples in the water."

Your sarcasm is accurate, carbs are definitely inferior, even on bikes."
awwwtf,ff3k2df,t1_ff2z2kz,1579542718.0,"Oh wow, that sounds like it'd be amazing. I never got the chance lol, my pet rats had babies (we didn't know they were male/female when we got them, oops) but the mother wouldn't let me touch them. She was named Cheezer (after the beanie baby that was also all-white) and she was normally very sweet and friendly towards me, but straight up bit my hand and drew blood when I got near her babies. 

Luckily there was no problems with them that required human intervention, and she stopped being overly protective when they grew up enough to venture out of their wooden hut over the next couple weeks. We kept two of the babies and the rest went to my mom's friend that loved rats and already had some as pets, and had the extra room to care for them better. They had to be seperated cuz rodents have a habit of killing family members for various reasons, and we didn't want that to happen so new living spaces were in order - which meant more cages, more supplies, and less space. 

Shitty thing about rodents is their short lifespans and susceptibility to tumors and cancer. They were all dead after only a couple of years. They're super smart, friendly, and trainable...but it almost seems wasted when they're gone so soon. I've never kept any rodents after that. They're great pets when you're young and a year feels like forever, don't think I could do it now."

Someone else in this thread mentioned that ""female"" is also the preferred way to reference a woman in the military.

But yeah, outside of those kinds of contexts, I've rarely heard anyone ever use the term ""female"" and agree that it'd sound weird."
insanepeoplefacebook,ff2ie45,t1_ff2hbga,1579507478.0,"It is. Some women may get miffed at the implication that they are old, but that is the proper respectful address of a woman you do not know, or a woman of higher authority than you. It's the feminine equivalent of ""sir.""

People in service and retail jobs refer to customers as ma'am and sir all the time, as a sign of polite respect. And while I've never been in the military, I'm pretty sure that if you don't address a woman who is your superior officer with ""ma'am"" then you're gonna have a bad time for not showing her due respect, regardless of her age.

If they are young/unmarried and not in a position of authority over you (or they choose to be referred to as such) then I suppose you would use ""miss."" The feminine form of mister, which is a polite address but lacks the respect you'd normally show a superior and/or elder."

Illicit drugs and workout supplements can do the same. Again, pretty much never for the better. You'll usually end up with a strong chemical taste/smell.

Bonus fact: iirc there's a supplement out there that can make your semen taste like chocolate, but it's very expensive. Or maybe it was just a comedy skit I'm remembering, might wanna fact-check it before repeating it to anyone."
