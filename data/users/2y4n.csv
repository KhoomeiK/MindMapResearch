movies,ff62t2c,t1_ff60il9,1579617704.0,"I mean there are many movies that drift away from the original ideas/films/books etc. because they want to tell a story that needs the ""universe"" the originals play in. It also makes sense from filmmaking perspective because you can presuppose some facts from that universe without explaining it to the audience (which would make some movies longer). However I cannot see the point why the movie has to play in the Batman ""universe"". For criticism in society you don't need Gotham. For the whole plot you don't need Bruce Wayne or his father (you could instead but someone new superrich). You can still keep the whole Clown thing because it is nothing super specific.
Don't get me wrong I think it is a good movie but the Joker thing kinda ruining it for me."
movies,ff61zcz,t1_ff5ui2q,1579617095.0,Yea I know what you mean. But even in TDK he got beaten up in several scenes. I just wanted to point out that the great age difference kind of makes no sense to me - maybe it's a weak point I got here. Another thing regardless of age I'd like to point out is what u/satellite_uplink said in the comments here. I cannot see how the Joker in Joker becomes a criminal mastermind.
movies,ff5n3ut,t3_ers6fv,1579601198.0,"Thanks for this post! I was almost fighting with my friends who all think it's THE BEST MOVIE!!11!!1! And I think there are many things which did not make it a 10/10 movie. First of all: JP did a great performance. But I think the writing of the character Joker in this film was not so good. For example: What always fascinated me about the Joker was the fact that you can never calculate what he is doing and why he does it. (Burns a shit ton of money, Swapping the hostages so Batman is going to save the wrong one etc.) After watching Joker everyone had ""poor boy"", ""no wonder he had become this crazy"" and ""he is the real victim"" mentality in their heads. Another thing is: The Joker is approximately in his 30s in the film. Bruce Wayne is like 9? So when let's say Bruce Wayne becomes Batman when he is 29, the Joker has to be at least 50 years old. Is a 50-year-old a real Antagonist to a 29-year-old when it comes to fights? Nah.

Let's pretend they named the film ""Psychopath"" or something like that and left all the batman universe out of it, it would have been a great movie. Obviously it would have never generated so much money."

Fitness,fexuk56,t3_equx3z,1579436427.0,"So I see a lot of comments about lactose intolerance and I want to give you a bit of an insight.

First of all: People are not lactose intolerant, they are lactose tolerant. But the majority of western civilization has adapted over the years to be lactose tolerant so we see it as an illness to be lactose intolerant. 

The most babies have an enzyme called Lactase and it makes you lactose tolerant - that's why babies can drink milk from their mothers. And yes there are diseases where babies don't have that enzyme and in the older days babies died from that disease. However: After we don't drink mother milk anymore we lose those enzyms. Some people lose it faster than others, so it's not uncommon that you get more intolerant to lactose with the years. How do you notice it? Well, because you still have Lactase left you can still eat a certain amount of Lactose but if you exceed that amount you get symptoms. That amount you can eat lowers and lowers so you tolerate less and less. And yes, there are some people that never lose an amount so high that they would notice any symptoms.

&#x200B;

Back to your story: I don't know how old you are or how much whey you consume by comparison to your past whey consum. But I think it's lactose intolerance."
