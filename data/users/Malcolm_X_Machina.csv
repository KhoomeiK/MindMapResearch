therewasanattempt,feltqak,t1_fels4yw,1579230708.0,"Strange I I never said club. I was respectful, but in reality, eat  fucking dick. I have seen and heard too many stories of the bullshit in ur community. If u read this thread two people in the community confirmed what I said. So who's are you trying to fool. FOH. You know that shit is rampant in gay communities. Gays treat trans ppl poorly. Many treat bi ppl as if they don't belong. Take your trolling bullshit elsewhere."
therewasanattempt,felpzxd,t1_felotcx,1579228125.0,"I wouldn't know first hand about the lgbt community. My cousin, who is half whit half black has said there is some racism, and he says that in his experience, there are many superficial ppl more than in straight community. I also have a white trans friend who says that he isn't treated the same after transitioning from a girl. I meant no offence, mainly that there is unfortunately more bigotry in our marginalized communities than, say, straight whites. Which I can understand. Marginalization breeds resentment towards those who who treat others poorly. Basically I feel bigotry comes from resentment, lack of empathy and the ilk. Like another poster said: we hate what we don't understand, and it seems the main people who do so, are generally reactionary. 

If you belong to the LGBT community, please enlighten me (respectfully, as I have never disrespected you nor anyone. I've stood up for *anyone* being disrespected, simply because that's the right thing to do, and wish we could all do the same"
therewasanattempt,feljde4,t1_felhm26,1579223583.0,Haha. K. I better go tell both my black parents they got the darkest white kid in the world by accident.
therewasanattempt,feldphk,t1_felczq4,1579219758.0,"Exactly. No matter word you pit. Hate is hate. I'm lucky enough to be from the south where I was hated just for being black and seeing how it felt, then having my cousins marry someone from Damn .ear every continent when moving to CA, learning we all have more in common than not. At the end of the day IMO, it's easier to love than hate, and is way less stressful."

therewasanattempt,fekpxm8,t1_fekcw6a,1579205175.0,"I actually posted this to bpt a while ago, and got 1 comment and like 20 upvotes. Sometimes ~~my race~~ all races don't realize racism goes both ways. It's sad how being marginalized can make you become what you despise. Just like the apparent racism and other hate in the LGBT community.

Edit. Hopefully nobody thinks in putting down blacks as the only culprits. I am black and have seen racism everywhere. I've been called one of the good ones ny my white girlfriend's grandmother, had to teach my gma about saying nip, dealt with way too much bullshit going into the army, and had to check my Mexican best friend for thinking he can say nigga. My main point is, as many if you said, WTF is so hard about not being a POS to people? And why is it that when you explain to you own race, or another, that you are labelled some whiny libtard or some shit?"
