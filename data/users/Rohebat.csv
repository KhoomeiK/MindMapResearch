dragonballfighterz,ffeiz49,t1_ff9mo68,1579849938.0,"You're right and 214H also seemingly has a minimum height if you want to combo out of it, you actually need to late cancel the j2H in this combo if you wanna keep it going, otherwise you don't have the frame advantage to link 5L"

If you can call Cell and also do 3 spirit swords then you'll probably get closer, but I doubt it'll be it. And I don't think you can vanish into DR with these, the hitstun was too high with similar combos attempted prior. Never got these enough to try it myself though.

If anything, I hope these at least give you some ideas to work with? Best of luck to you!"
dbfz,ffbqz2m,t1_ff9qaek,1579779235.0,"Gogeta's BnB is a little wierd but it's just a matter of getting used to it really. As long as you keep grinding at it eventually you'll have gotten it down pat. Remember to take breaks if you get frustrated, too. I had thought up until recently that I wasn't able to do A.Gohan's leg loops at all but I tried them yesterday and managed to get a rep off first try, so sometimes fatigue or tilt can be stopping you from doing what you don't realize you've built the muscle memory for.

As for my sugesstions, I wasn't able to find a way to make using held 236S a true blockstring, and 236LM is reflectable. 236LLL is a true blockstring so you can do that into assist into blockstring no problem."
StreetFighter,ffbqtlf,t1_ff9oovs,1579779038.0,"Yeah what I meant by combowise is that it's very hard to hit confirm something into light tatsu since the cancel has to be done almost point blank. I tried CH st.lp > cr.hp xx lk.tatsu after writing this comment and found that even that was too far out to get both tatsu hits. Maybe CH cr.mp > st.mp since st.mp moves you closer to the opponent? I'll give that a shot.

Given it a shot, you do get both hits of lk.tatsu but hp.dp doesn't connect, not does EX.dp, so it's not worth. Also found out that CH st.lp > cr.hp was a terrible way to test closeness as the normal links from st.lp (b.mp, st.lk) both get the two hits of lk.tatsu, even if both are similarly unable to get hp.dp afterwards."
dragonballfighterz,ff9hvj3,t3_esejey,1579713357.0,"I have 2 ideas:

Get rid of the jM jM before j2H j214H, add more hits after the 214H. It looks like the 214H itself does a lot of damage, so you'll want to get that as early in the combo as you can to stop it scaling as much as possible. Make up for the lost jM hits by adding them later in the combo. If you remove even the j2H you might have enough time to get in a rep of 5H jc iad j5H 5H and still do the rest of the combo.

OR

instead of ending with 236L Vanish DR, do 214L vanish DR to keep them in the corner and more importantly close to Vegito, as he gets more hits of 236LM the closer to the opponent he is."
dbfz,ff95zha,t1_ff8guet,1579705646.0,"Gogeta I usually do the SSJ Goku route and end in the 236A rekkas. If you want, you can call your assist before or during 5H (depends on its startup) and do 236S instead, holding S and either leaving the stick neutral to go into 2L/2M or holding forward to go for an IAD overhead. Unless you have a high blockstun assist though, it won't be an airtight blockstring so they'd be able to reflect or reversal. Another option is to do 236LM + assist, doing the M version of the second rekka puts your airborn and you can airdash for a high/low mixup. I think there's a gap between the first rekka and second though."
StreetFighter,ff8o62l,t1_ff8o1u9,1579688447.0,"Yeah, it's just tight because he needs to get both hits of L.Tatsu and afaik that only works combowise from st.hp xx VS1 > L.tatsu. He also only gets 2 hits of H.DP usually, only only getting the full connect in VT1.

M.Tatsu into EX DP is actually damage optimal if you can get it, though it'd have to be either a stun combo or you're punishing something very minus and up close."
tumblr,ff8nued,t1_ff87ka1,1579687962.0,wait you mean they're not talking about stuff like Refreshers when they say candy bars?
StreetFighter,ff8lx7e,t1_ff6dcwc,1579684995.0,No? Ken gets H.DP after L.Tatsu (easier in VT1) and EX.DP after M.Tatsu. Kage's are just more optimal.
worldnews,ff2t5ks,t1_ff2ptrj,1579523084.0,"It apparently was at its worst last year:

>In 2017, Trump made 1,999 false or misleading claims. In 2018, he added 5,689 more, for a total of 7,688. And in 2019, he made 8,155 suspect claims.

>In other words, in a single year, the president doubled the total number of false or misleading claims he had made in the previous two years combined. Put another way: He averaged six such claims a day in 2017, nearly 16 a day in 2018 and more than 22 a day in 2019.

from the article. He's only been ramping it up as his presidency has continued:

>In 2018 and 2019, October and November ranked as the months in which Trump made the most false or misleading claims: October 2018: 1,205; October 2019: 1,159; November 2019: 903; and November 2018: 867.

for anyone wondering what sort of metrics they're using:

>The president added to his total on Sunday evening with more than 20 Trumpian claims — many old favorites — during a triumphant speech at the annual conference of the American Farm Bureau. He incorrectly described trade agreements — suggesting Canadian dairy tariffs were eliminated and an agreement with Japan to reduce tariffs on $7 billion of farm products was “a $40 billion deal” — and also falsely asserted that “tough” farmers and ranchers were crying as he signed a repeal of Obama-era regulations. A [video of the event](https://youtu.be/ca73cWtySvE) shows no one crying.

dbfz,ff246zj,t1_ff23gak,1579493335.0,"Read through ~~both~~ all 3 of your comments, you make very solid points across the board. Thank you for taking the time to write all that out for me.

From what I gather from this (and for anyone else reading these these are MY own thoughts based off my new understanding so if it's a dumb conclusion heckle me not Willoh2), the reason for the ""either you're winning or not playing"" mentality is because people have a tendency to practice offence much more than they practice defense, and so most don't properly mix up their defensive options or know the situations where one option can get them a clean break?"
dbfz,ff20d98,t1_feyxcpc,1579490448.0,"Looking at all of these on a list, it does feel like DBFZ has a lot of defensive options, but looking at each one individually I think I can make an argument against it.

* Frame 1 reflect nullifying everything it comes in contact with

It's a fantastic defensive tool if you can press it safely, but there's various ways of just not letting them do that. Most blockstrings done are true blockstrings specifically to prevent them from being reflectable, forcing you to guess high/low. You can't mash it here either, since you have to stand to reflect. Reflecting on wakeup gets ~~stuffed~~ worse if they use a long duration assist like GT Goku's, as they have time to react and respond to the reflect. 

* Invincible GC

That is unsafe on block and can be beaten straight up by certain normals like 2H and also by assists. Most times I've seen this used either the one using it gets punished for doing so or at best causes some sort of trade thanks to an assist and gets a scramble situation, but almost never just a clean reset to neutral.

* Up tech negating all mix ups

Perhaps too hyperbole? It negates a lot, but there are some characters who can do safe jump IAD j5Hs and still catch uptech just with the tip of their hitbox. Some characters like A.Gohan have good ways of covering uptech whilst also covering other options. Assists like, once again GT Goku's, are able to catch uptech and force them straight back into a blockstring. Certainly against some matchups uptech is very useful, but not all of them.

* Delay tech variable between 1 and 30 frames

I don't have an argument against this one, this is a very good defensive tool. Usually the wakeup animation is fast enough to be unreactable, with many delay wakeup -> mash resulting in the defender winning, and you have to spend assists if you want to ensure coverage of all possible timings.

* No chip damage

Chip damage is incredibly low, yes. I don't get the impression that DBFZ was really designed for it to have any impact anyways, with how offence is designed around using chaining and assists, there's no safely spacing Sonic Boom around here.

* Rare strong mix ups, and even rarer strong SOLO mix ups

They are rare, but from my perspective their rare overall but not rare per character, which is why the top tiers are where they are; they have the strongest mixups. Since most professional players use the top tiers there's many more strong mixups shown in their games. If I can mention Kid Buu's assist again, which gives a 4-way mixup just because you got them to block 5LL2M.

* TOD only from certain rare starters.

Isn't this how it should be? Would you mind explaining further for me, I don't want to disagree because I'm mininterpreting your words.

* Rarely any plus moves

In my mind this relates back to how offence is designed around chain cancelling and plus frames. All the plus frame moves are deliberately slow and interruptable, encouraging taking a risk each time you want to stagger pressure. Even with this, stagger pressure works because of the reward given to the offence if they hit the opponent with a delayed chain cancel, usually resulting in an unscaled starter. Defenders are discouraged from reflecting should they not delay and use 2M, which would hit them for not blocking low, or even if they stagger by just ending their blockstring, meaning that they might punish the reflect attempt. Vanishing is another option but if they scout that it can be 2Hed, and even if not they can vanish it themselves, meaning you've now taken a hit and lost a bar. There's rarely any plus moves because they're not necessary for a strong offence.

* Backdash

Can I get further explanation for this one too?

* Blue life

I agree in terms of functionality, that blue life effectively increases character's health and allows them to live longer, but in terms of semantics I don't see this as a defensive option, since it does nothing to help you get out of pressure.

And you didn't mention this one but I want to talk about it anyways;

* Sparking out of blockstun

A very strong reversal and a very welcome change when it was added. It is only once per round, though. As further questioning, is sparking offence the kind of offence you'd like to see if they buffed offensive options? With options like hold vanish, jump cancelling blocked normals, and superdash/6M allowing you to continue offence even on block?"
dragonballfighterz,feww64k,t1_fewvf03,1579420427.0,"Yeah, exactly. Even just looking at their autocombos, SSGSS Goku gets a mixup between 5LLL and delayed 2M, and Base Goku gets to set up spirit bomb or do corner combos with his. SSJ Goku's amazing beam assist, Base Goku's lockdown assist, and Blue Goku. SSJ Goku's amazing damage from most hits thanks to 236M/H and sparking ki loops. Really, Goku Black and SSJ Goku have more in common and they don't share a single animation. My only comment is the tendency people have of seeing re-used assets or animations and having a knee jerk reaction to them."
dbfz,fewvb4b,t1_fewuzus,1579420047.0,"I'm not actually quite sure I agree with that, people already have a ""you're either winning or not being allowed to play the game"" attitude about it. If they bring everyone to GT level, they'd have to buff defensive options to go with it. Maybe buffs to guard cancel?

And thinking on it more, it doesn't seem like ArcSys' style since they've been removing most simple/low-cost 50/50s there were in the game, like Bardock's level 3 oki or Gotenks 5LLL assist 50/50. I wouldn't actually be too surprised to see a nerf to Kid Buu's assist next season."
dbfz,fewucbj,t1_feweznz,1579419615.0,"S2 started with Videl and Jiren, right? With people calling Videl's rekkas ""what 17 should have gotten"" iirc, and Jiren's moveset certainly being unique (command grab 5H, no scaling 2L). Even though they ended up being low tier I like what ArcSys was trying with them, and Gogeta and DBS Broly have really shown their A-game in giving characters combo variety, especially DBS Broly. I'm honestly really excited to see how characters are in S3, and here's hoping the re-balancing that comes with it means less GTku in every team at tournaments."
dragonballfighterz,fewtllv,t1_fewit07,1579419297.0,"I agree with you that they play completely different but they do share a large movepool in terms of normals. 5L, 2M, 5H (excluding Base), 2H, 5S, jL, jM, jH and j2H, along with jS sharing animation even if it has a different function. Like, yeah, it's goku. Of course it's the same animation, it's the same person. There's just the common thought of re-used assets -> bad design. Not saying it's wrong, not saying it's right, just saying that the thought's there and can make some people jump to a negative impression."

dragonballfighterz,fe6dxpx,t3_enqpqy,1578888072.0,"I have an idea for a change to the super that could be horifficly bad but here goes anyways.

Let the super still be combo'd into, but make the move air techable after it throws the opponent up and have the spirit ball move far enough away from GT Goku that the only possible followup for him to get would be 214H. This way, his oki is much worse if not completely neutered since whilst he would still get an SKD he would be very far from the opponent and might not even land soon enough to get off his own super, so you'd have to call in another character with their level 3 if you want oki from the spirit bomb.

For the problems this addresses in the meme, whilst it is still easy to hit with really good damage from comboing into another super it shouldn't have any mixup potential anymore. It also would take an additional bar to perform the additional supers. In short, the super's still great if you've got the bar to dump for the kill, or you're fine with dumping 7 bars for a level 3 mixup with a different character. But for only 3 bars, it becomes a pretty crap level 3 and his other level 3 would become preferable in most situations.

Alternate idea is to completely remove the pop-up from the spirit bomb so it gives similar oki to base goku's, just without the damage. So to keep it relevant compared to his other level 3, when you have 2 or less teammates you can spend an extra 2 bars after the super to go SSJ4 and perform a grounded Dragon Fist. Overall, this would give better damage and oki then his powered up level 3."
