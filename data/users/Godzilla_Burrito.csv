If you want a suggestion, how about writing a mini novel to let some feelings out. It helps"
sad,fcnoii0,t3_eh3wo0,1577815410.0,"Bro. It'll be okay. I miss my ex too. And she cheated on me. We'll get trough it. Sure, we'll remember what happened and all we miss about them, but we have to keep walking. Even if it's slow. Let's do something we can grow so we can get distracted. I'm starting guitar by myself and on day 3 of both. Wanna try something too?"
