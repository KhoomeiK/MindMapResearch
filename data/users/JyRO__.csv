ForHonorVikings,ff8bcn1,t3_erwyy3,1579671739.0,Damn time is passing ... it almost feels like yesterday that I chose to be a viking in the beta. Feels good to be one tbh.

depression,ff2bsqy,t1_ff27xq9,1579499979.0,I wouldn't necessarily say that narcissism is deeper than depression but I get what you saying.
anime,fej6dxp,t3_epfm5u,1579158757.0,"One of my own personal favourites is the soundtrack from Darker than Black.

Yoko Kanno did an amazing job there imo."

depression,fe6ullr,t3_env9a0,1578905637.0,"I absolutely refuse to work for approximately 40 years from now on.

I hate how this world functions, if I don't find a cure for myself to make things better or even bearable I'm going to commit suicide by the time I become 30 yo (I'm 24 btw)

I hope that I have the courage to do it, I just want to end the fucking suffering."

depression,fdczzfb,t3_ekmksg,1578289478.0,"I'm not particularly happy when listening to music, but I enjoy it on a kind of deeper level of understanding.
Idk it's hard to explain, being alone and feeling the music is an experience I can hardly describe, but it feels astonishing.

Does that even make sense? idk tbh ..."
