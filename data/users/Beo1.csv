worldnews,ffgwssw,t1_ffgwpic,1579917061.0,"> Perhaps most-frightening is the estimate that the the basic reproductive number of the infection -- which is the way of saying how many people will be infected by each person who has it -- is 3.6-4.0. That means unless 75% of the people who have it are treated and quarantined, it will continue to spread unabated. That compares to estimates of 1.1-4.2 for SARS

> SARS, however, didn't spread as fast in its first few weeks as the coronavirus, according to WHO data. It took almost two months for SARS to spread to 456 people. By comparison, the 2019 coronavirus has already infected more than 900 people in less than a month."

I’m assuming this is the same U.K. group that wrote an article estimating about 1,600 infected a week or so ago, when China was still saying, what, less than 100? It’s a good thing the fatality rate is below 5%, and that it’s fairly unlikely to rise above that."
