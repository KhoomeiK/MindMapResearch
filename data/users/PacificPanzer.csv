boone,ffaufpu,t3_eskf1i,1579744743.0,"I wouldn't be surprised if it was a county ordinance, similar to how Boone was dry until relatively recently."
Antiques,fevbuu4,t3_eqp5zb,1579395541.0,"My parents have some of these that we inherited. All I know is ""valuable.""

It's interesting that yours is cut in half. Does it come apart to hold something? It also appears to be pen illustrations instead of etchings? Unless I'm just not looking close enough."
bourbon,fevb6fc,t3_eqnyv4,1579395315.0,Knob Creek Maple makes a really good Old Fashioned.
Militariacollecting,femw4cv,t3_eptx8s,1579271160.0,"Haha. Still pretty ""modern."" Those are basic issue and inspectable items for every transportation vehicle in the Army."
shittytechnicals,femvntp,t3_epvc64,1579270822.0,I know someone who needs this
cats,fef6lic,t3_eoqsyn,1579049398.0,Woah. I wonder what spooked him?
Tacomaworld,fee0jqf,t3_eoogut,1579023847.0,I am interested in what you find out. I love my 2020.
cats,fedvj0z,t3_eojhp9,1579020784.0,Maybe he had a headache. That's adorable
MilitaryPorn,fdqcwbv,t3_emmgtn,1578663287.0,"I love how ordinary that overpass looks, but for most Americans, that would have been the first time they had been on a highway (Autobahn), and the first overpass they had seen."
savannah,fdm02ct,t3_em2wz1,1578536603.0,"Congratulations! It doesn't have a view, but Garibaldi's on Congress is a very good/romantic place. My wife and I went for our first anniversary. It's Italian seafood, but my wife ordered a steak and I ordered duck. It also won't absolutely kill your wallet."
RoastMe,fdiv73p,t3_elm4hd,1578451771.0,"2005 called, it wants it's Livestrong bracelet back."
witcher,fdgoom6,t1_fdgl5xr,1578404189.0,Probably not as much time as he spent fighting it.

Warthunder,fdcn18j,t3_eknb5a,1578278970.0,"I completely agree. It's fun, but I'd really like to see all of those LS's rush some cruisers."
army,fd9k1y6,t3_ekd8vp,1578234479.0,"Relax, you're probably going to NTC."
appstate,fd9axyd,t1_fd91kpw,1578230922.0,"I was there when a water pipe broke on the 4th floor on the Ihop side. It froze in the stairwell and it was a complete disaster. 

When I was there, the poop wasn't too bad of an issue. I wouldn't mind living at the Standard if I hadn't lived right over the hot tub."
JustBootThings,fd6l2m6,t1_fd6jyra,1578192599.0,"Ah, I'm Army, so I was unaware that Marines are getting cool shit now. You're definitely right about the clearly recognizable lady instead of large animal in the photo."
Tinder,fd6izzb,t3_ek6mz5,1578191771.0,Are you trying to match with her on purpose??
ToyotaTacoma,fd6gwts,t3_ek6h2s,1578190837.0,Sick! That's the best one I've seen

witcher,fcyynsn,t3_ejmd6r,1578089993.0,"I agree! I'm not sure I would call game Yennefer ""beautiful"", but Anya Chalotra just doesn't quite do it for me."
Warthunder,fcywpnv,t3_ejmga2,1578088746.0,"I agree. 9/10 times I get absolutely wrecked in Air RB. Shit, I get wrecked in the arcade NPC missions too."
MilitaryHistory,fcynm5e,t3_ejk05i,1578083414.0,"Really cool idea. Honestly, most of the high tech stuff we have on the Army side is maintained by civilians. Vehicles to computer networks. I imagine it's almost the same for the Navy/Marines. So maybe introduce some DoD contractors if it doesn't mess up your plot. 

I'm fairly certain the hardest part about working together would be a mistranslation in jargon, i.e., head:latrine, Gunnery Sergeant (Gunny): Sergeant First Class, Deck:Floor. 

Most prevalent to your proposed plot, the Marine Corps doesn't have ""Medics"" in their infantry. The Navy attaches ""corpsmen"" to their formations. Same job, different ""boss?"" 

Additionally, the Marines rely on the Navy to support a lot of administrative functions and to staff hospitals. The Army is entirely self sufficient, with doctors, nurses, lawyers, and finance staff. 

As far as hand-me-downs, I can't think of any recent examples of equipment being moved from Army inventory to the (Navy) Marine Corps. I think it happened with the M1 Abrams in the 80s and perhaps some small arms in the 60s/70s."

savannah,fct4ei8,t3_cudxqm,1577932590.0,"I scrolled and scrolled, hoping you would mention my friends and my favorite bars before being vindicated by the ""I JUST WANT TO GET FUCKED UP"" section. 

You mentioned Treylor Park as a good place for dinner, but I LOVE drinking there."
ToyotaTacoma,fct16ai,t1_fct1002,1577930204.0,Crap. I missed out on that. I'm starting to wish my salesman had done a better job.
TankPorn,fcsydt8,t3_eipz89,1577928218.0,I'm sure that's a tough one to open with no power or if hydraulics are out.
