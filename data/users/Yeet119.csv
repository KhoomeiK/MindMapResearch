SuicideWatch,ferkjnq,t1_ferj9i7,1579355084.0,Thanks that’s some great advice and I believe that I can’t do it. Thanks for the great advice
SuicideWatch,ferg8dn,t3_eq147c,1579353519.0,"To everyone that was really concerned about me yesterday. It really means a lot and shows me that people do care even if I’ve never met them before. Thanks to everyone who reached out to me yesterday it means everything to me but I still feel the need to talk to some genuine people online and offline like a meet up. Do any of you live in South Africa, Johannesburg so we could meet and I would like to thank you in person but I’m thanking everyone else here as well. All of you opened my eyes and I saw that there is still people in this fucked up world that still cares about other people. So thank you all"
SuicideWatch,ferfl1p,t1_ferdanb,1579353329.0,Thanks for that message. My dream is to go into music but where I come from it’s challenging. But I guess I’ll just try and make it I guess.
SuicideWatch,fendsir,t1_fendoq7,1579282529.0,I wish there were more people like you
SuicideWatch,fend44c,t1_fend0yq,1579282120.0,But the eagle thinks of every move it does
SuicideWatch,fenbzqq,t1_fenbr4b,1579281432.0,I don’t feel strong
SuicideWatch,fenbxsk,t1_fenbsu2,1579281400.0,I don’t know if it will make me happy. I’m just at a point where death seems as a better option. Why would you miss you someone who don’t even know.
SuicideWatch,fen9onz,t1_fen9nej,1579280005.0,That would be nice
SuicideWatch,fen9ja7,t1_fen9elg,1579279914.0,I wish my dad would say that but I guess dreams aren’t real
depression,f8phoki,t1_f2su0xp,1574701706.0,Yeah but what if your family sees you as a disappointment or failure for not doing good in school even though they know you don’t cope well in school
