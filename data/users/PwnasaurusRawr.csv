The fault here is with the developer, because I use dozens of ad-supported apps and not a single one has ever shown me porn.

editors,fdhgi7g,t3_el2o78,1578422151.0,"Just wanted to throw my perspective in here: in my experience working under people who were contracted to create things for clients, in general the only way the client got project files was by buying them from us at an extra cost. 

The logic of my superiors, I think, being that the project files were not the final product that the client was purchasing, in the same way that if you go to a restaurant the chef doesn’t owe you the recipe for your meal, and that giving the client project files was most likely allowing them to make future edits on their own, costing us future business.

I’m not saying this is necessarily the right way to go about it, but it’s what I’ve seen people do and it makes sense to me and works for them. That being said, I don’t think you should ever flat-out refuse to give a client project files (unless that was pre-negotiated in the contract), I think if you really don’t want them to have them then you should just charge more for them than you think they will pay. I will warn, however, that I have never been the one in charge of contracts and negotiations, so take my ideas with a grain of salt."
