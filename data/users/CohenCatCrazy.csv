AskReddit,ffehdre,t1_ffegxdr,1579848076.0,"LOL it was embarrassing enough going back to school the next day and having to tell all the other kids why I left early to the hospital...

I couldn’t imagine being now 30, with no eyesight in my left eye, and having to tell fellow adults about that fucking ant haha I guess I was lucky?"
AskReddit,ffduwn1,t3_esy81b,1579829531.0,"In 4th grade an ant fell into my eye, bit it, and died. The ant had to be surgically removed from my eye to prevent loss of eyesight. 

People never even believe me when I tell that story haha"
depression,ffdrgu5,t1_ffdrc70,1579827120.0,Thank you. It just seems like everything I've gone after the last 5 years has put me in increasingly worse situations. So frustrating; like the universe has it out for me. Hoping for some positive change soon :)

vegaslocals,ffal8n0,t1_ffakc7w,1579738554.0,"I’ve built a career around being an Executive and Administrative Specialist, something that in CA (LA & Central Coast Area, two markets I’ve worked in), pays between $20-$34 per hour. Here, all Administrative jobs seem to pay $13-$16 max; I’ve only seen about 1/2 dozen that pay near $20, but expect candidates to have a Masters. 

For us, rent is only about $400 less per month, yet a job for me would pay about $18,000 less per year than I made in California; making me about $13,000 short per year."
vegaslocals,ffahj28,t1_ffah52v,1579735876.0,"Good for you! 

We wish we hadn’t moved some crappy place like Vegas haha but we have so many friends out here who kept speaking highly of Henderson and how nice it was and blah blah blah. 

Needless to say, we’ve been actively looking for jobs back in the LA suburb of Santa Clarita; hoping we can just move back at the end of our lease. If we’re going to struggle financially, it might was well be someplace we like and close to family again."
AskReddit,ffabokj,t3_esedhp,1579731764.0,"When it comes to conversations I’m not very lady-like. 

I’m sarcastic, I swear, I don’t get offended by raunchy jokes (sometimes I’ll even join in), and I speak my mind. I assume people think my personality is maybe just a little intense & outrageous."

Lol."
vegas,ffaaxb1,t1_ffa0wdg,1579731324.0,"Agreed, definitely don’t expect freebies for your Bachelorette. Vegas would lose so much money giving away freebies to the thousands of Bachelorette parties that come through every year haha 

BUT, telling your hotel when you check in may get you some freebies. For my Bachelorette, we stayed at Vdara and mentioned at check-in that it was my Bachelorette. Minutes after checking into the room, they sent up complimentary bottle of $65 champagne and a platter of chocolate covered strawberries with a “congratulations” card! It was a nice gesture and made me feel special."
