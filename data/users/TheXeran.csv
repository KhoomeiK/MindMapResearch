MoBo - $55

16gb ddr4 3k mhz ram - $60

At work so sorry if I left anything off. Mind you the $650 number is assuming you already have a monitor you're okay with, and a keyboard and mouse. Also, like I said before a lot of shopping around for open box items that are marked as ""like new"" helped shave a lot off this total. For more HD space I'm just using an old external HD in my usb 3.0 slot, and it gets the job done just fine.

 I did buy windows from a grey market retailer so that could add another $100 to your total. If you know any college students you can get it highly discounted from them as well

As for games I've been playing Modern Warfare and Borderlands 3 at max settings with no issues.  For $1,000 though you could build something in a completely different tier than what I built, including peripherals"
