AyyMD,ff9gw8b,t1_ff9frhj,1579712757.0,I didn't know anandtech made such mistakes but well. They are human. So the new  BIOS is for all 5600xt models then?

AyyMD,ff8ewsd,t1_ff8epdi,1579675544.0,I think price/performance 1660Super is still better than 5600XT and RTX 2060 maintains similar price/performance (+6% perf for +7% price IIRC). I personally do think 5600XT is a sweet spot card but it's not particularly innovative. Just priced competitively to counter nvidia.  Yeah 1600Ti is decimated though.
AyyMD,ff8ejif,t3_es7iar,1579675123.0,I mean you should've felt jebaited after 1660 Super. You must have become accustomed now :P

pcmasterrace,fe6s9vo,t1_fe6pxs2,1578903008.0,I don't think there is a RX570 Fatboy. You might actually have a RX590 which is a overclocked RX580 that draws way too much power.

insanepeoplefacebook,fe08pqa,t1_fdyitgd,1578806146.0,"They exist mostly to stick it up to Democrats, liberals, immigrants, and everyone else they find intelligent than themselves. They do this to get a raise out of people and partially to assuage their repressed racist tendencies. Trump is the demagogue they wanted for a long time, someone that everyone else finds repulsive, can match their racism and act macho without any real substance. They are not stupid, just overcome with emotion to see the truth. The more people in the left get angry over trump, harder they will try to support trump. Only way is to actually stop giving orange man attention and focus on real goals."
