Changing someone's palate is really difficult.  Is he worth it?  If so, then get ready for a hard slog.  He obviously has a very remedial relationship to food, probably through his childhood.   He isn't wrong, per se, since it's probably not his fault.  You might want to test him out on what foods he might be willing to try, since variety is important to you (and food is a marvelous connection between people, especially couples.) Has he ever watched Anthony Bourdain?  He's very good at introducing guys (in particular) to new foods because he was sort of a wise-ass, street smart, curmudgeon himself.
