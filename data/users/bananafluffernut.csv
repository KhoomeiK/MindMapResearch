BanPitBulls,ff59gnq,t1_ff4ypbn,1579584257.0,"I mean, I have a chihuahua, the most hated Reddit breed. I think she’s pretty cute, but anytime someone posts that they were once “attacked” by one and they’re all evil, I don’t post a pic of mine wearing a flower crown. I acknowledge that she can be an asshole to other people, so I get why lots of people don’t want one. I do appreciate the irony though of, “All chihuahuas are the devil!” vs. “It’s all how you train and treat pits! Mine is the sweetest!” If pointed out, nutters revert to, “Well, people don’t usually train little dogs.” There’s probably some truth to this, but they’re also feisty little hellions who aren’t easily trainable. I accept my dog’s genetic failures, especially since it isn’t going to cost anyone their life, and I don’t have a huge chip on my shoulder for people who don’t like the breed."

BanPitBulls,fel73n1,t3_eplbkz,1579215475.0,"I haven’t watched it, don’t know if I’m going to be able to. The sad thing is, is that some idiot out there, probably several of them, will claim that the pit was abused and therefore triggered and therefore it’s not his fault."
relationship_advice,feiw889,t1_feifw7g,1579148904.0,"She’s manipulating you by throwing around the word “abuse” every time she hears something she doesn’t like. Arguing, suggesting, and disagreeing are not abuse, especially when she is dead wrong. Blowing a budget she doesn’t contribute at all to, becoming morbidly obese and denying there’s a problem, and acting like a lazy slob and not pulling her weight (pun intended) around the house are not acceptable actions from a partner. And on top of that, she angrily declares that YOU are the problem, not her, and is against any form of change. Is this how you see your life for the next 30 years, or however long her heart can last? If not, get out now while you’re still young."

FuckYouKaren,fedwvxp,t1_feduwik,1579021601.0,So women with short hair are uptight bitches? Reddit is looking so good on the gender role stereotypes today.

legaladvice,fe4vshy,t1_fe47okz,1578863240.0,"You also need to check that the pit is up to date on its rabies vaccine, and make sure there’s a record of its bite for when it does this to someone else in the future, if it’s released back to the owner. And medical costs and pain and suffering should be paid by the homeowners’ insurance. And don’t feel badly if people try to say the dog will be put down now that you’ve reported it - a dog biting someone and holding on for 3 seconds is not normal, wanted guarding behavior. A dog should always give plenty of warning to back off - this is a dangerous dog."
