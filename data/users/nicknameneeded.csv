facepalm,ffrpgvs,t1_ffrh9kk,1580162922.0,"well you sadly are sorely mistaken

1. snapdragon 855 is a strong chip but a13 mops the floor with it in almost every, if not every score due to difference in age

2. late 2019 iPhone's cameras are almost guaranteed to be better than mid 2019 upper midrange LG phone's and they basically are, with dual pixel autofocus against phase detection and apple's processing; yeah the iPhone is missing a telephoto but it's main camera is good enough even for cropping photos.

3. iPhone 11 has 4gb ram while g8s has 6gb, however iOS ram consumption is much lower and it can run just fine with 2gb (compared to android which stutters even at 4gb)

minor details: 

1. iPhone is rated for 2m for 30 minutes against 1.5m for 30 minutes on LG

2. lg has a slightly larger battery and a usb-c port but has a slightly weaker frame (6000 vs 7000 aluminum)

3. lg has an oled while iPhone has an lcd; both have their advantages but an iPhone lcd is much closer to an oled than an android lcd usually

now, g8s is a lot more ""bang for the buck"", as they say, than an iPhone, but your claim that the specs are the same is invalid. at this point a13 dominates the SoC world, at least until 865 comes out."
