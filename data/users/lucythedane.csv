dogs,ffacr1f,t3_esicks,1579732477.0,"First thing, and I know you say you listed it for the looks, but I would avoid Cockapoo's and all other designer mixes. Reason: there are no reputably bred designer mixes, and because the breeding stock is 9 times out of 10 not health or temperament tested, there is an elevated risk for your dog having heath or temperament problems. 

Second, even though it's a smaller breed, Norwich Terriers are still a terrier - and terriers were bred to catch and kill small rodents and pests. There are definitely examples of terriers that get along with other pets (cats), especially if raised from puppyhood with them, but in general it can turn into a bad combo. If it were me I wouldn't completely rule them out, but it's a good thing to keep in mind.

Out of just the breeds you listed, I think a Bichon Frise could be a really good fit! They're stellar companion dogs, and you obviously already like their look.

Outside of your list, and looking towards slightly larger breeds, what about a Golden? A well bred female is somewhere in the 55-65 lbs range, while a male can hit 65-75 lbs. Not exactly Mastiff size, but also not toy sized either."
dogs,ff9uq8s,t3_esg8pf,1579721831.0,"Yeah that feels a little weird to me. Those are some genuine concerns for not wanting a female dog, and choosing the sex of a dog is a lot different than wanting to pick a dog based on appearance with no consideration given to the early temperament. Gender has an affect on how the puppy matures while something like color does not. 

Something to keep in mind - I believe most or at leas a lot of breeders have a spay/neuter stipulation in their contracts for dogs not intended to be used in future breeding programs. I'm looking at GSD breeders in the TX area right now, and all 3 of the kennels I've narrowed down to required pet dogs to be fixed at min of 18 months, and I think the max range they give is 2.5/3 years. Not entirely sure what the consequence for not following through on that is, or how they enforce it, but it IS in their contracts. 

Anyways, probably you should look for a different breeder."
dogs,ff061g1,t3_er18qm,1579465588.0,"Why specifically do you want a goldendoodle? Is it the coat? The look? 

If it's either of those, then why not just a golden or poodle? Doodles of any kind are not guaranteed the perfect hypoallergenic coat their advertised as having, and it's basically a toss up on what type of coat they inherit - and you can't really tell until their adult coat starts coming in, at which point you've had the puppy for awhile. 

If it's how they look, then just know you can clip a regular poodle to look like that too. It's generally called a puppy cut, and is generally what the doodles are cut to look like. [Here's a link that shows a few variations](https://iheartdogs.com/beyond-shaved-feet-popular-poodle-cuts/). There's nothing stopping you from having a poodle with the same cut though.

Additionally, the breeders charging $3k for a doodle and calling themselves reputable are 99.99% likely not. Reputable doodle breeders are brought up on this sub pretty often, and so far there hasn't been a single reputable one found. There's probably one out there (hence the .01%) but they haven't been discovered yet."
dogs,fezeypd,t1_feynwae,1579456628.0,"Got a couple suggestions for you to look at then! 

First one, a Bernese Mountain Dog. They're very athletic, affectionate, and super smart. They like to be around their owners, and are typically more reserved around strangers. Their weight range is about 80lbs - 110 lbs, and they might be a little to slobbery for you, but can make really great active companion dogs. It's possible they could be on restricted lists though, breed specifically or just because of their weight. 

Second dog to look at are Vizslas. They're a lot smaller (45lbs - 60lbs), but make excellent active companions. They're also a lot more friendly to strangers than BMD (could be a good thing if you meet lots of people on trails, or bring your pup lots of different places) and really like to be around you. They do look a bit different from the examples you've said you like though.

German Shepherds could be an option too, but again they're smaller than the weight range you're looking for. Looking to the more giant breeds, Leonbergers are dogs to look at as well. They're a bit larger than your ideal weight range, but can make good active/hiking companion. The handful of Leonberger breeders I'm aware of will basically only sell to individuals/families that are demonstratively active and want to bring their dog places. Again, slobber might be a dealbreaker here. I wouldn't recommend any of the other larger/giant breeds, since most are either too large for what you're looking for (by a lot), wouldn't do good with that type of lifestyle, or aren't typically dogs someone with less experience would have a good time with. Honestly, Leonbergers are kinda pushing it too...they can be a bit pushy and independent. 

Last recommendation to look at: If you like rotties, I would say they're not out of the question. They fit your ideal weight range, and you have experience with them.

Hope this helps!"
dogs,feymvzw,t3_eqvykq,1579447725.0,"Large to EX large dogs are often restricted in apartments. It’s not really about specific breeds either, a lot of time it can just be a weight restriction. I’m in TX so obviously a bit different, but off the top of my head I can list a few apartment complexes around here that either a) restrict you 60lbs or under, or b) have a very long list of banned breeds that includes basically every well known dog over 75lbs (Newfoundland’s, Great Danes, St. Bernards are all included on these lists). I would definitely keep this in mind the closer you get to bring a dog home. 

A few questions...you say large-ex large, but it looks like maybe GD would be too large? What would an ideal weight range be for you?

You also mention a chihuahua - would this dog be coming with you?

dogs,fee2383,t3_eon31z,1579024791.0,"At the moment, I have a male Newf and a female Dane. No issues between the two of them, and my Dane does extremely well with other males at the dog park. However, she has criteria for what female dogs she’ll tolerate. 

They have to be between about 35-65 lbs - smaller, and she plays too rough and can trample them accidentally and any larger and she refuses to interact with them. There also seems to be specific breeds she likes/dislikes more than others. For example, if we meet a lab or golden, she’s all over them. She does not like huskies though, and won’t have anything to do with them. 

She’s lived peacefully with other female dogs in the past though. When I still lived at home, my parents had a female Australian Shepherd that’s about 5 years older than her. They got along for the most part, but if they were left unmonitored during play there was always a chance my Dane would get a little nasty. It got worse after she (the Dane) had her first heat, and while they could coexist in the same room after that, they could no longer be left alone. 

I’m looking to add another puppy now, and knowing her pickiness with other female dogs, I personally will be getting another male. Overall, I think it has more to do with 1) breed friendliness 2) the environment they’re raised in/general socialization and 3) individual personality. Hope this helps!"

dogs,fdjyepw,t3_elnzyj,1578491358.0,"Not a bad idea at all! 2 years ago, I had just my 3 yr Newfoundland. Decided I wanted another dog, and ended up with a Great Dane puppy. They were instant beat friends :) I have a picture from the night I brought her home of my Newf laying on the floor and her curled up into his neck. They’ve been inseparable since. 

My parents have 2 dogs of their own - a Newf and an Australian Shepherd. They also foster puppies and young dogs, which means the puppies often have to stay with them for a few months before they’re ready to be adopted out. My parents dogs adore all their foster siblings that come through, and the puppies love them too. 

Also, growing up my family has always had multiple dogs. Some we got as puppies, some as adult dogs, and all at different times. There’s always some sort of adjustment period, but even the most lovey lap dog can learn to get along with another dog just fine. 

I will say, because your current dog is so small, looking at another small breed puppy may be a good option. Puppies are playful and clumsy, and a 20+ lbs puppy may accidentally hurt your dog without meaning too. A 10-19lbs puppy runs the risk too. Also, while most dogs do get along with other dogs, there’s always the chance one of them may not like the other, even if they get along with every other dog on the planet. 

At one point, my family had a St. Bernard that was a couple years old. We brought another Newf puppy into the house, and they got along perfectly fine until the pup was about 1 1/2 years old. Then it was like a flip switched, and the two absolutely HATED each other. We had to keep them 100% separate, otherwise it would be an instant fight to the death. We ruled out medical issues, and even saw a behavioralist, who in the end told us it was unlikely the two would ever get along. My sister took one when she moved out, and they both lived their beat lives separate from each other, and never had a problem with any other dog for the rest of their lives.

My dogs are under control when we're out, but there's only so much I can do when a tiny little unsupervised chihuahua runs up and tries to bite my dogs feet - and my dogs are 150lbs and 130lbs, so one bite from them and these loose dogs are bite-sized toast.

Dawn soap kills fleas and is safe to bath animals with. If you can’t get your roommate to wash his cats, then your best bet will be to give them a dawn soap bath. 

DE (I recommend the food grade bag on Amazon) is a fine powder that also kills fleas. It’s made of crushed fossils (basically) and will shred bugs on a tiny level then dehydrate them to death.

I would recommend you get some of both, rub a ring of the Earth around each cats neck, wash them with the dawn soap, and then sprinkle the Earth around the house. Fleas will run to the head when the cat gets wet, so putting a ring of Earth around their necks will force the fleas to run through it and get shredded. Any fleas left behind will get washed out by the soap. 

If you get the food safe stuff then it’s fine to dust it onto furniture and carpets and beds. After all bed sheets/blankets/other have been put through the wash, you might even want to dust them too.

And honestly, it's good advice, but I fee likes it should be aimed more at people who want puppies and have zero experience with dogs in general...which isn't you. I know plenty of people who adopted dogs during college, some who could handle it and some who couldn't. A lot of the ones who couldn't were just generally unprepared though, and there are other questions you should be asking yourself as well that are arguably more important than just age.

What do you want from your dog? As in, do you want a super chill dog that's fine hanging around the house with you and doesn't require a ton of exercise, or do you want one with more energy that needs more attention/mental stimulation?

Would you want to take your dog places with you? On errands around town, or to outdoorsy dog friendly events?

Will this dog be around children or other animals frequently?

What size dog do you want? What behaviors could you not tolerate? Ex. frequent barking, potential dog aggression, etc.

How much time can you dedicate to the pup on average each day? How much exercise? How much non-exercise time?Are you willing to make accommodations for a dog that may need extra training? Would you be willing to pay a trainer if your pup develops behavioral problems that you can't manage on your own?

Age would depend a bit more on some of your answers, but in general I'd look for a pup 2 years or older. I would also recommend looking at dogs in foster homes or from rescues, as those dogs have typically had some sort of handling/temperament assessment/vet check/rehab/etc. that will give you a better idea of if the dog will be a good fit for you. Not to say that shelters don't do those things, but depending on your location they will be less likely to have done any of those things. My neighbor adopted a dog from a shelter a few weeks ago that had been picked up literally the day prior. Pup has some behavior issues, was covered in fleas, and needed some minor medical attention (which they were prepared for). I'm in Central TX though so that type of thing isn't uncommon here. Don't know what shelters look like where you're at. 

A third option could be to contact a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html) near you, not for a puppy, but to see if they or anyone in their circle is looking to re-home an adult dog. A reputable breeder will require a dog be returned to them if the owner can no longer care for them, so sometimes they'll have an older dog that needs a home. Adult dogs that are no longer needed for their programs will also typically be re-homed, and occasionally a puppy will be raised with the intention of entering their programs but be disqualified for one reason or another. 

Final thoughts: I would recommend you fill out this subs [breed questionnaire](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/4qc6lb/meta_breed_questionnaire_updated_june_2016/). Even if you plan to rescue, it will give you a general idea of the type of dog to look for that will best fit your situation. Good luck!"

dogs,fc5u0vq,t3_egc3kk,1577465867.0,"Gonna agree with everything being said about Huskies. They're great dogs, but definitely not a good first time dog, and really definitely not the best to bring around small children or small pets. I will say that I do know someone with 3 rabbits and 2 huskies, but in order to keep the harmony the animals are 100% separate. There's a rabbit side of the house, and a dog side of the house. Additionally, this person takes her pups everywhere, and trains for triathlons with them in tow, so they're getting way more than an hour per day. 

As someone who grew up with an Australian Shepherd, I'd say they're also not the best first time dog. They're very high energy, and can get very nippy and will herd your kid around the house...which for a small kid, means getting knocked around a lot. This will be a general fact for pretty much all of the herding dogs.

Goldens and Labs could be a good choice, but they will typically need more exercise/mental stimulation than most people will tell you they do. I think an hour/day could work out, especially since you say someone will always be home.  

You mention you're willing to look at dogs from M - XL. I would say stick with M sized dogs, and only maybe look at L dogs. XL dogs (such as Newfoundlands, St. Bernards, Mastiffs, Great Danes, etc) have reputations as gentle giants that are good with kids, and they are and can be, but they can also be absolute nightmare puppies. An XL breed puppy can outweigh your kid within a few months, but still have the same clumsy puppy energy. One good bump from a 100lbs puppy and your kid can get hurt - these dogs stay puppies until close to 3 years too, which means excitable puppy energy for 3 years. XL dogs aren't ones I'd normally recommend to first time dog owners and/or owners with kids under 7/8 years old, and even then I'd hesitate. 10+ would be a better age range for those I think.

Also going to be seconding waiting until your kids a bit older to get any dog at all. It's not impossible to raise a kid and puppy together, but does essentially double your work. The final decision is up to you and what you're willing to commit to, but I would personally wait until 4/5 before bringing home a pup. 

Last bit of info: finding a dog. If you go the shelter route, I would pass on any young puppies and look at dogs that are at least a year old. Still young, but you'll have a better idea of how the dog will be around your kid/other pets.

For a rescue (breed specific or otherwise) I would also follow the same rule. Rescues can be picky about who they re-home dogs to though, and the process can be a lot longer than adopting from a shelter. But, dogs from rescues will typically have been handled for a bit and someone will be able to help you find a personality that will really fit well in your home. In both situations (shelter and rescue) I would consider doing a foster to adopt program, to make sure your new dog will get along ok with everyone in the house. 

And finally, if you decide to look at a dog from a breeder, you've actually got two different options. First option is a puppy. Second option is purchasing a returned dog, or a dog that was removed from their breeding program. Dogs get returned or dropped for a variety of different reason...could be health or temperamental, but that doesn't mean the dog will be unhealthy or nasty. Could just be they don't have the right instinct to justify breeding them (ex. my Dane comes from an active hunting line, and her first owner returned her because she refused to leave his side and follow the other dogs out...she preferred to stick to him like glue) or that they're carriers for something and the breeder doesn't want to risk passing that down. 

Anyways, this is a lot of info and I hope it helps!"

You're definitely gonna want to dig into whoever you choose before committing, but hopefully you can have some luck there. 

Depending on your location, rescues can be very picky about who they re-home to. If you can't seem to find a good match, reaching out to a reputable breeder could also be an option. Not for a puppy though - for various reasons, adult dogs can sometimes be returned and need homes. Breeders will also sometimes keep puppies for future breeding, but for one reason or another, remove them from their program once they're adults. This could be for health or temperamental reasons, but doesn't necessarily mean these dogs are unhealthy or have a bad attitude...they could be carriers of something that the breeder doesn't want to risk passing down, or just a little too excitable (or in some cases, not excitable enough) to justify breeding them. They'll be looking for homes for these dogs as well. 

Hope this helps!"
