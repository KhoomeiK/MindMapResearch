""John Stuart Mill argued that the chief threat to free speech in democracies was not the state, but the “social tyranny” of one’s fellow citizens.""

When the rights of all become the privilege of a few, who just happen to have the ""right"" words, and those who have the ""wrong"" words are oppressed, neither liberty nor equality can last. This is the entire soap box that free speech was built on centuries ago. Fully libre speech allows truly bad ideas to enter the free marketplace of ideas, yes, but the marketplace will simply respond by not buying into those ideas and ""dragging"" the person posting them. If that person is silenced, they miss an opportunity to be educated by their peers, and will just sit in resentful silence, their internal bubble making their ideas angrier and worse over time."
