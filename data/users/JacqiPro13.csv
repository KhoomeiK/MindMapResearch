happy,ffdsh53,t1_ffdhmxa,1579827796.0,"Hey, I completely get where you’re coming from, and it’s okay. So, so sorry for the novel, I tried keeping it brief and failed... I’d be happy to chat privately more about it if you would like

The biggest thing is being prepared to create and embrace a total lifestyle change, and by that, I mean becoming incredibly conscious of spending, and cutting out most anything that wasn’t a necessity. 

I make budgets for every paycheck both my boyfriend and I bring home, check what bills are due with each week, and make sure they’re paid (and ON TIME; late = late fees) first and foremost. Of course I’m a bit neurotic about it and I make my budget all months ahead, and adjust as we are paid. It eases my anxiety.

I also keep a strict budget for groceries, you’d be surprised how far a change in your grocery budget and food choices can take you (shop the sales, coupon, buy off brand- it’s almost always the exact same product as a name brand and what generally makes name brands more expensive is, of course, just the name- but be sure to compare ingredients/product), go somewhere like a Walmart or cheap equivalent for household necessities, canned goods, etc., then buy your meats and produce at a better grocery store, but still stick to those deals and weekly specials. Gotta cut out the fast food if it’s applicable, it’s insane how much coffees, quick lunches/dinners, etc. add up...seriously. When we started this process and I went over our spending I damn near had a heart attack because it felt like we barely spent any money going out.


I wrote out my debts: the type of debt, the amount, if it’s time sensitive, the minimum monthly payments, and most importantly the interest rate, and paid them down by highest interest rate first. Of course another great way to approach your debt is by paying them off by the smallest debt first, also known as the snowball method. It’s incredibly encouraging seeing them disappear one by one no matter how small.

No matter how much or how little is left after bills- *put it away*. Every single penny will add up, and whether it’s $5, $50, or $500, that’s more saved than what you had before. It’s tempting to spend, so make sure you allow yourself small rewards now and then. Also finding free and inexpensive hobbies and pastimes really helps keep you sane.

Get rid of the unnecessary bills, like streaming subscriptions. It stinks especially if you don’t have cable, but it’s helpful and there’s alternatives online. 

Shop around to possibly lower bills like car insurance, cell phone bill, things that aren’t necessarily stuck at a set rate. 

If you can’t handle or don’t have the time for multiple jobs, I recommend looking into gig apps, survey apps, online work, etc. I’ve been doing it for a year and it’s helped so much, even if just gotten me that gas I needed for the few days before the next pay 

It’ll be uncomfortable, it’ll be stressful, and annoying, but trust the process. It *will* pay off and you’ll be thanking yourself. I know it’s overwhelming, but you’re awesome and doing future you an amazing favor by starting and trying. You’ve got this. And I’m here if you have any other questions or wanna talk!"

happy,ffcgl1l,t3_esvawc,1579799008.0,"A little background: My boyfriend and I have been on a two year long get-out-of-debt-and-build-a-savings plan, all the while I’ve been working on a lot of my personal goals. All of 2019 was incredibly stressful but we worked hard, sacrificed, went through some setbacks, I kicked my own ass into gear, and now we’re starting to see the payoff. I was always self conscious because my teeth were pretty gapped, so I did smile direct. I lost 25lbs over 8 months (shoutout intermittent fasting), finally developed a healthy relationship with food, and I finally figured out a career path I want to pursue (and can afford, and pays really well!!) after stopping due to both my mental health and realizing my original major was just too expensive (Psychology)...anyway I just reenrolled in school, and my boyfriend starts his new job in a couple weeks after months of looking. I’ve suffered with mental health and related body issues for quite a long time and the stress of the last two years only exacerbated it but even with my insurance I couldn’t afford treatment. Thankfully just after the new year I discovered an app that finally got me with a doctor and started a treatment plan without wondering how I’ll be able to afford it (K Health, *highly* recommend). And with so much ahead, my bf and I can finally move back into our own place and move forward with our lives together. We’re going to kick 2020’s **ASS!** I’m sorry if this sounds braggy, I don’t mean it to be. I’ve just felt hopeless for a long time, it’s damn near euphoric feeling so optimistic now and I’m glad I didn’t give up on myself :)"
happy,ffcefuh,t1_ffcce5v,1579797693.0,Thank you so much! And you're so right. It felt like I'd never see any pay off but I finally am and it feels good. Very worth it.
personalfinance,ff9irek,t1_ff9heal,1579713890.0,"Makes total sense when you put it that way, and maximizing my company's match is actually what I finally worked comfortably up to late last year, so when I'm ready to increase future contributions, I will open an IRA.

Seriously, thank you for all of your input. It's incredibly helpful as I try to teach myself all of these important things and do what's best for my future. I know there are resources out there, but sometimes talking to an actual person makes it easier to understand."
personalfinance,ff9h3eu,t1_ff9gmpg,1579712881.0,"Ahhh okay, I gotcha now. Looks like it *was* a Roth 401k, not an IRA. Thank you for clarifying this to me. Always learning...

And yes it still shows me the same contributions I had when we were with PNC, so I'm good to go. I appreciate your insight!

Last question before I go purge the Wiki again, would it be at all beneficial to open my own Roth IRA if I have a Roth 401k?"
personalfinance,ff9giqu,t1_ff9g6vy,1579712526.0,"Ah I see, thank you. It looks like I'll have to call Fidelity and PNC about this because now I'm wondering if it really was a Roth IRA, or a Roth 401k..."
personalfinance,ff9gee7,t1_ff9g43v,1579712452.0,"Hmmm, now you have me wondering. I seriously thought it was a Roth IRA account, but if my company couldn't access it maybe it was a Roth 401k...pardon my ignorance, but what's the difference between a 401k and a Roth 401k, if any?

All I know is that when we used PNC, I had two different accounts with my employee login, one for sure a 401k."

povertyfinance,fdkhzuk,t3_elryxp,1578504250.0,"I don't say this lightly. You have truly helped me more than you could know by posting this. I've been worrying and fretting over seeing a mental health professional for over a year because every place I've called and looked into is a minimum $150-$200 just for a consult/diagnosis, and I simply do not have that kind of money to spend after monthly bills and what have you, even with my insurance I have to meet a deductible before I get any coverage for the services I need. I've been battling with worsening anxiety and symptoms of adult ADHD, and have felt nothing short of hopeless about it. But now I've just signed up for K Health and am currently waiting to speak to a doctor now, all at an *affordable* price.

OP, you're a rockstar. Thank you *thank you.* And thank you to everyone who contributed to this amazing list!

&#x200B;

Edit/update: after filling in my info, waited \~25 mins for a doctor to speak to me. Did a 2 minute meet via video call, then went back to chat where he diagnosed me officially and is now sending medication to try right to my door. I can reach out any time for help or with questions, and he will follow up in a couple weeks. I'm in awe how easy this was, and the relief of not having to worry how I'll afford this is overwhelming. Give this a try if needed, folks! Good luck to you all!

Edit 2: Sorry, I should clarify I’m being sent anti-anxiety medication, not something for ADHD. The doctor could not prescribe me a controlled substance through the app but could diagnose and refer me to somebody in person who could. I hope this helps!"

Original price was $298 (tag even verifies it), I started the listing for it at 50% of original retail plus free shipping, now it's down to $100 and still nothing. I've tried Mercari, Let Go, and FB Marketplace. I'm super new to selling things so I'm not sure what else I can do. I prefer not listing anything for local pickup because I currently live with my boyfriend's family so I don't feel it's respectful to have people showing up to their home."

intermittentfasting,fcuetzh,t1_fct9l3g,1577979254.0,"Yes, there are multiple phases in fasting based on how long you go: ketosis/heavy ketosis (starts at hour 14), autophagy, growth hormone, insulin reduction, and immune cell-rejuvenation. Without writing a novel, [here’s an article](https://lifeapps.io/fasting/the-5-stages-of-intermittent-fasting/)  that explains them pretty well (which I got through my “Life” app that I use to track my fasts. It’s pretty cool! Just scroll a bit past the intro and it’ll tell you about each phase) :)"
intermittentfasting,fcsazga,t1_fcryvbu,1577914006.0,"Thank you so much! And hey that's great, you've got this my friend! (Apologies for the ramble ahead...)

Well I work 9am-6pm Monday through Friday and I keep busy most of the time, so honestly after getting through the couple weeks of adjustment, it became rather easy to just stick it out until dinner time. I also drink a lotttt of water (and on the struggle days hot green tea and black coffee because that's allowed while fasting), so that definitely helps keep my appetite at bay.

Socially it definitely is a struggle and I empathize feeling like an inconvenience, but you absolutely shouldn't. Your choices with diet and food have no affect on those around you, and I hope they can be respectful of your choices as you are theirs! It's a lifestyle change, not just another ""fad"" which I know a lot of people may think from an outside perspective, ya know? I don't find myself in too many social situations where this is an issue simply because my bf and I have been trying to save money this last year so we didn't go out much, but if ever social occasions did come up, I would just plan ahead and alter my fast so that by the time the event came around I could participate. If ever I *couldn't* eat anything, I would keep a beverage in my hand at all times. I've found it helps keep people from asking a bunch of questions or giving you a hard time lol.

I will say after the first few months, I started getting more lax because I was seeing results, so I allowed myself flexibility on weekends and didn't always fast, just was mindful of my calorie intake and never eat right before bed!

Sorry, I too went on a ramble lol. Point is, keep up with it! I plateau'd myself after dropping initial water weight, so I played around with my fasting windows and my calorie allowances, and found that doing at *least* 18:6 and keeping my daily calories at 1200, while a bit difficult, was what got me my results! They were slow and steady, but it was a healthy loss per month at 2lbs. Walking helps a lot, too. You don't need to workout like crazy if you don't want. Don't give up, sometimes we just need to make adjustments and see what works best for our bodies, because everyone's is different! Also idk if you use any of those fasting apps, but I've been using the LIFE app, and being part of the Reddit group and also looking back and seeing my progress helped keep me motivated. :)"

intermittentfasting,fcrlps0,t3_eilljh,1577903451.0,"I began this journey and took those photos April 21st, 2019. I started out doing 16:8-18:6 daily at a calorie allowance of 1200. I did this for a couple of months with success and I loved how I felt doing it, so I’ve upped my fasts to minimum 18:6, but typically do between 20:4-22:2 and OMAD with a 1200 calorie allowance. I started hitting the gym 3-4x a week by mid summer, so on my workout days, I upped my calorie allowance to 1450, as I loooove to lift and get pretty into it. After vacation in September, I got lax and have only hit the gym a handful of times since, just stuck with my OMAD/20:4 IF. Since October I started only doing fasts Monday-Friday and gave myself more leeway on the weekends. After my initial 10lb drop between April and June, my weight loss was about 2lbs per month, which I think was pretty healthy and steady! The last pics seen above/my last weigh in was December 28th, 2019. Now that I’m at my goal weight I will keep my calorie allowance to my BMR, which is 1400!

I haven’t weighed this weight since 8th grade, when I stopped growing vertically lol. Without divulging my whole life story I’ve struggled with my relationship with food and disordered eating since I was about 13-14 years old. I couldn’t truly say I loved myself since basically puberty. I was in a dark place. My entire life from age 3 until about 19 I was an athlete. But after several injuries from high school sports left me too worse for wear to continue being active in sports, it just made things worse mentally. I got physical therapy and now thrive on being able to embrace my athleticism and go hard in the gym. My weight loss goals have been met, but now my focus is on gaining back muscle I’ve lost during this process and toning up entirely. Along with continuing my improved mental health journey.

Anyways, sorry for the tangent. This community has really kept me motivated. I see everyone’s posts and feel so much pride for you all, whether you’ve been at this a while or are just starting, I swear it’s worth it! Happy New Year everyone :)"
