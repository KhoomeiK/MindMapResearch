horror,ffb2bh5,t1_ffb0phs,1579750015.0,"One of the best parts of the Halloween movies is that there is so little gore, and it's still terrifying. They do get bloodier as time goes on, and the franchise is worthless after H2O in my opinion, but none of them are like torture porn. It's all about that tension, that's what separates horror from someone with a budget's morbid curiosities about torture, rape and murder, which is what all Rob Zombie's movies are if you ask me."

I just remember that before grade school even, my favorite movies were the Halloween, Poltergeist, Critters the Ghoulies etc... So maybe I was born a horror junkie?"

depression,fevfd9f,t1_feutnpe,1579396761.0,"Reformative justice is something we don't do well in the US, which is unfortunate. That said: an abuser or person that does bad things has to WANT to reform or it will never work. People that hurt others and show no remorse, and make no attempt to help themselves grow and change are people I have no trouble passing judgment on."
depression,feve6lj,t1_feu2jof,1579396407.0,"There is a statute of limitations on sexual abuse, regardless of age. It's an awful truth. If you have the right lawyer, they can help find loopholes (blocked memories, attempting to tell and being stopped or not believed) but it's not easy."

buffy,fdbwq7x,t1_fdbk7nm,1578263060.0,"I think both arguments have validity. I loved the way got too see Andrew grow, though I believe he remained flawed. His shaming of Angel for getting in bed with Wolfram & Hart was misguided. But so were Angel's ideas about the ramifications of his collusion with the enemy. I think Andrew was unjustly vicious and sanctimonious, especially considering his own history. I also think it was important for someone to hold a mirror (ha!) up to Angel regarding that decision and it might as well be someone who understands evil from the point of view of having done evil. They are both good, and both capable of bad. 

The same is true for Johnathan, who was introduced as character before Andrew and thus had more opportunities for redemption, but also, to make more wrong turns. His flaws include his willingness to be manipulated into doing bad things and hoping we'll feel sorry for him and his weak his weak will. Would watching him grow have been less valuable than watching Andrew, or would it just hold different lessons, learned in a different way?

My main point here is: I believe in reformative and restorative justice. Whedon's works all include examples of the opportunity to give and receive a chance to change, for better or worse. All characters are given the opportunity to ""do bad"" or ""do good"" things. Sometimes they disappoint us, sometimes they surprise us. But for the most part, they all try really hard,  when they fail and mis step, we can see their capacity for good, even when they are doing bad things.  They're real. They're us. This is why we love them. Because they're both and so are we.

(Faith is another great example for this discussion, but we're talking evil nerds right now)"
buffy,fdba2hm,t1_fd9ucwd,1578255355.0,"Perhaps, though his character's value is not lost on me. Do you think that largely held opinion is linked to some folks thinking Johnathan should have been the one given a chance at redemption? A notion I don't disagree with, but Whedon's willingness to take things/people from us (the viewers) is part of why his works have so much power. ""Fairness is not reality"""

dollhouse,f8bnu41,t3_cueknp,1574441228.0,"I believe the episodes Epitaph 1 (S1 finale) & 2 (series finale) were where the series was to head as it progressed. I think Joss and the staff already knew they wouldn't get the opportunity to tell their story by the time they wrote Epitaph 1, and that's why S2 is turned up to 11 from the start, where S1 gave us a slow, but thorough and interesting introduction to the characters, S2 is the begining of a war, Epitaph 2 is where they hoped to end up. This is my favorite work by Joss, and given the way they had to rush it, I think it was beautifully executed."
