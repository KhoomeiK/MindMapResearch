bulletjournal,feyw7cy,t3_eqok2s,1579451218.0,"i actually do the opposite, because i dont like setting up dailies/weeklies. i use my bujo for havit tracking, chore tracking, keeping track of birthdays, recipes i want to try, etc. then, i keep track of all my school things in a separate planner. however, this probably only works for a student, or someone who has a lot of tasks for work. probably once i graduate, i’ll move everything to my bujo. if’s honestly whatever works for you, thats the beauty of bujo! good luck :)"

AmItheAsshole,fej4zm3,t3_epfly9,1579157121.0,"NTA - in general, you should never feel bad for switching therapists. even if it just wasnt working for you, and the therapist isnt doing anything inherently “wrong.” i think his flippant attitude towards this very traumatizing violation of your privacy is more than enough reason to find a new therapist."
Frasier,feizunb,t1_fdzxo3e,1579151966.0,"my absolute favorite episode. i usually show people this one when introducing them to the show, although sadly i think some of the maris jokes probably go over the heads of first time watchers"
Frasier,feizr27,t3_enqz1i,1579151879.0,"does someone have the quote? i’ve only seen it on Netflix and live TV as well, so i’m curious what she says... maybe it was edited out due to trigger warnings, although suicide is mentioned a couple of other times throughout the show so it seems odd"

bulletjournal,fcclc51,t3_egz361,1577599726.0,"if you cant decide, theres no reason not to do both, unless you would find it too annoying to fill out a mood tracker twice in one day. you could also consider having a year in pixels mood tracker, and the track something specific for the month, like anxiety, for instance."

bulletjournal,fc4f4iy,t1_fc4e41z,1577414849.0,"I don’t mind at all! Basically, I just decided how much I want to save for each thing and drew the sprinkles with different dollar amounts on them. Then, when I out away that amount of money that I want to dedicate to that fund, I’ll color the sprinkle. Once I reach the goal, I’ll color the icing. The one drawback is, I’d have to decide to save a whole $100 or so to get to the next sprinkle, but I usually just take some money off my paycheck, so I want to save in larger amounts anyways, rather than in $20 increments or something."
