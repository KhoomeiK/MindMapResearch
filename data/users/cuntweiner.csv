nyc,ffdx3a9,t1_ffd04dz,1579831082.0,"smh people downvoting this man for generously providing us with such revelatory information. Thank you kind google master. However, upon reflection, I'm afraid I shall also down vote in disagreement of your assertion that 5'11"" is ""as average as you can get."" You see, your precious Google states that the average American man stands at 5'9"", therefore 5'11"" is not in fact as average as you can get–it's above average, which could reasonably be asserted as 'tall'. Nothing you have stated is factually correct and your misguided spirit sings loudly in the wrong key. Your edit, a smug display of desperation and arrogance, will not save you this time, or anytime really. The almighty arrow will soon take the podium, and your words will plunge deep down to the fiery pits of eternal damnation. Sorry brah"

AskNYC,ff4qfvr,t1_ff4hd3e,1579569967.0,"I have used UPS Access Points and Amazon Lockers with success(as a last resort) when I lived in a more lively neighborhood. No big deal, I would just pick it up next day at the print shop two blocks away. With my new apartment, my packages are straight up disappearing from Amazon's tracking or getting sent back, and the closest locker is like a mile away. I don't want this to be my main option for parcel delivery, because that's just ridiculous tbh. This has never been an issue for me or any of my friends. Everywhere I've lived, there was a package room or my packages appeared at my door. Never lived anywhere fancy, so I was not aware that getting your packages delivered to your address is a luxury. Seems like a pretty simple feature to implement, and not having it is causing me so much stress right now. Going to the post office is a freaking nightmare, and I've had the same experience you had with the 11211 station."

AskNYC,feuxnz4,t1_feueaz3,1579390988.0,"If you get a light roast single origin at a place with inexperienced baristas, it'll probably end up under extracted, and thus sour. If a place is serving high quality coffee, make sure they also have high quality baristas–this takes a little research or trial and error, but if you talk to the barista and they seem confident about their opinion of the flavor profile, there's a good chance they have the palate to get the brew right or dial in the espresso correctly. Lot's of baristas are newbies and don't give a shit. I've worked at many hyped local shops only to encounter baristas that have no idea what they're doing."
recording,feujo4m,t1_fet21j6,1579387179.0,"I have the same Bugera model. I hated the darkness at first but simple mods did wonders for mine. Replace the crappy Chinese tubes with a Sovtek or Tung Sol EL84, and an EHX 12ax7. Makes a yuuuge difference, and will only set you back $30. The preamp tube alone is fun to experiment with. JJs are good but a little too thick sounding for this amp imo. I use the EXH for more complex clarity and grittiness. Upgrading the speaker will make a huge difference too. The stock speaker is pretty muddy. And lastly, forget about conventional EQ settings for this amp. I just play it with bass on 1 and treble on 10. This might seem extreme, but also it’s how Tony Iommi set his Laney amps in the early Sabbath days, and his tone was thick as hell so it’s not that crazy!"
AskNYC,feu36ge,t1_fetnh2x,1579382704.0,"All of the coffee you mentioned in your first paragraph is corporate shit. Even Blue Bottle is owned by Nestle, which is reason enough to never go there. I worked with La Colombe for two years. The reason their coffee is decent is that they don’t allow baristas to touch the espresso machine until they complete hours of training and pass certification, but their roasts are nothing special. Corsica in particular is barely on par with burnt Starbucks crap. 

If you want good coffee, there’s plenty of roasters in the city with high QC standards and devoted baristas. Check out Sey or Partners in Brooklyn. Birch and Stumptown are pretty good too. None of the cafes you mentioned have any real quality oversight, that’s probably why they’re shit."

I've lived along the A,F, and G lines and ""signal problems at Jay street"" is a phrase that will forever trigger me. The L's route is certainly not the best, and most have to transfer to another line in Manhattan, but conversely, it's also pretty great to be able transfer to any north-south line in the city, and right in the middle of the two major business districts.
