I live in a white-minority, low-income city. After being a single dad engineer for 20yrs, I quit my job after my son graduated college to find something more meaningful to do. One of the things I tried last year was teaching in their HS as those kids are just as good as the kids in the suburbs, but hardly any of them go onto being self-sufficient let alone middle class. Around my city are many career options within their reach that could raise them to a stable middle class income. There’s nobody pointing them in the direction of these practical decisions though. They’re more likely to have people telling them to “follow their dreams” even though that’s a recipe for 99% of them to never eacape poverty. It is so heartbreaking to see smart kids, proud of being the first in their family to go to college, come back in a worse situation because they’re deep in debt for a dream-following-degree which only results in careers for a fraction of its graduates (and usually only the wealthy and well-connected).
