offmychest,fdccceo,t3_eki8ru,1578271487.0,Thank you. I needed to hear this . I’m turning 40 this year and would really like to go back to school and just learn about something I’m interested in instead of just jumping through a hoop to get employed.
TwoXChromosomes,fd72f5g,t3_ejyuic,1578198592.0,❤️. Sometimes the best and most selfless decisions are the hardest. It takes strength and courage to do what’s right. ❤️

aww,fcuxq88,t3_eiyvyy,1577990629.0,He is so beautiful!  ❤️❤️❤️. I just lost my shepherd/husky x who had huge ears like Meatloaf’s. Those ears were so soft and my favourite part of my dog. This picture brings back good memories and makes me happy. Thanks for posting. 😀
