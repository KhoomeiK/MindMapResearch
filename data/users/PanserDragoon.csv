AskReddit,fcg7ug2,t3_egzbk7,1577637327.0,"People who vote controversially but then cant actually name any tangible policy or reason for why they vote that way. I'm perfectly prepared to accept people who dont see the worlds solutions the same way as me but when people vote for harmful politics and cant even say why that vote was perceived to benefit them, then I start getting annoyed. Seems all that matters in politics these days is slogans, smear and scandal."
AskReddit,fcbp1dw,t3_egzz5g,1577589388.0,That allowing other humans to suffer and die is acceptable when the alternative is loss of profit... Hopefully anyway. Probably not though.
cats,fcbkbyl,t1_fcbb1o9,1577587866.0,"He certainly looks it :) Grey fur with silvery highlights, that face and shape are spot on as well. If his eyes are green (or amber turning green if he's younger) then he's very likely a Russian Blue. They're lovely cats, though my little one is a bit mischievous because he has a little too much energy for his own good ^_^"
cats,fcba0s3,t3_egvuje,1577584310.0,Russian Blue? Absolutely amazingly loyal and affectionate cats :) I'm sat with my baby curled up on my feet right now :) He also runs to meet us at the door :)

cats,fc8koca,t3_egpd29,1577536914.0,Oh that is one handsome brooding cat :D
cats,fc793gh,t3_egk37v,1577500783.0,"Was just thinking that tank is a terrible pick for Goldfish then saw other people already commenting which is good to see. But yeah, Goldfish are messy fish, they need space and good filtration to get by. If you want fish for a large jar like that maybe look into Beta fish, they're pretty and are happy to live in spaces even smaller than that though you cant have more than one Male per tank, they WILL kill each other :/"
cats,fc6owgy,t3_egg081,1577485784.0,Love the scratch marks in his chair. That resonates with me xD
