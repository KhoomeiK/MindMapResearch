Maybe the built in one is soldered on instead of being removable. Maybe it can only slot 4gb of ram or has an outdated processor. Its hard to tell from what the stores publish.

3. Power supply. This deserves special mention, because its the one component of your pc that **can burn your house down**. GPUs draw a lot of power, and need a power supply that is rated to deliver that amount of power for an extended period of time.

So on the one hand the risk of exposing your child to dirt is minimal, but on the other hand they won't suddenly become immune to chickenpox because you let them play in the sandbox: this is not a substitute for vaccines.

However, the one thing environmental exposure from a young age is good for is preventing allergies. The idea is that as young children not only is your immune system learning what's dangerous, its also learning what *isn't*. Allergies happen when your immune system comes across some non-dangerous thing it hasn't seen before and freaks out and tries to attack it as though its an infection. By exposing your kids to dirt, animals, pollen, peanuts, etc. from a young age you can teach their immune systems that those are normal parts of the environment that don't need to be attacked, and lessen their risk of developing allergies."

However, the one thing environmental exposure from a young age is good for is preventing allergies. The idea is that as young children not only is your immune system learning what's dangerous, its also learning what *isn't*. Allergies happen when your immune system comes across some non-dangerous thing it hasn't seen before and freaks out and tries to attack it as though its an infection. By exposing your kids to dirt, animals, pollen, peanuts, etc. from a young age you can teach their immune systems that those are normal parts of the environment that don't need to be attacked, and lessen their risk of developing allergies."
