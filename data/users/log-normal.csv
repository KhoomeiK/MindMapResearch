AskReddit,ffp0eoq,t1_ffoqppl,1580083989.0,"> as far as people who actually believe the earth is flat. its probably like 100 people with actual mental disabilities and a bunch of trolls

Unfortunately, there are many reasons for people to believe things other than ""what has the most support"".  There are people who think eating rhino horn is an aphrodisiac and cures cancer.  Some people believe things out of desparation.  Some people are lonely and will believe things in order to belong to a community (which, IMO, is most religions - if there were no community around it and holy books were just another book on the shelf in a library, very few people would be religious).  Some people don't trust ""authority"" and actively want to have something where that ""authority"" is wrong to make themselves feel better.  

I totally believe that there are people out there who believe, for one reason or another, that the earth is flat.  What to do about that, I have no idea.  You also don't want to prevent people from thinking strange things.  Some of our greatest accomplishments in science have occurred from people who researched in defiance of ""authority"", like Galileo.  As long as the vast majority of people (99%+?) believe the things that are the prevailing school of thought in science, I'm OK with there being a very small contingent of people who don't believe and want to prove it wrong.  The downside is we have some people who think weird things, but hopefully it doesn't affect the rest of the population."

AmItheAsshole,ffi7w1o,t1_ffi6y53,1579967391.0,"> But the fact that she got him fired

I would disagree with this.  It was a business trip, and it wasn't her saying anything malicious or false that got him fired.  It was his actions while he was representing the company, and showing poor judgment in exposing the company to risk.  

I agree that I would probably have pressed to not room with a woman if possible just to avoid even the appearance of something potentially improper going on, but I'm also mid-career and OP sounds much younger.  OP also says:

> I take it upon myself to tell HR and they contact his boss from his office.

So I don't think she contacted his boss; she told her HR and then they contacted his boss, and his boss made the decision to cancel the contract.  

This reminds me a lot of the infamous [DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS](https://www.removeddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9eore0/my_boss_just_informed_me_that_in_the_morning_hr/) thread on r/legaladvice, which is a great read."
AmItheAsshole,ffi6nhp,t1_ffi6czg,1579966493.0,"Well, I guess that's just where we'll have to agree to disagree.  I agree that those numbers would imply cutting risk in half, but there are many things that we do on a day to day basis where we could cut the risk of negative things happening in half or lower, but we don't do it.  And just because we don't do it doesn't mean that suddenly the victim is at fault.  

In general, I think that the online discussion (especially on reddit) about these 'woke' issues trends too far to the left (and I've gotten my share of downvotes for arguing against them), but I don't think this is one of those cases.  The way I see it, the roommate is 100% TA, the business is probably 50% of an AH for requiring employees to room together in the first place, and she is probably in the range of 10% AH, which is low enough for me to classify her as not TA.  

That's an NTA from me, dawg.

AmItheAsshole,ffi684i,t1_ffi52z7,1579966177.0,"I'm more of a numbers person and less of an emotions person.  So let's say that with a male roommate, there is a 2% chance of an adverse event happening, and with a female roommate there is a 1% chance of an adverse event happening.  Note that I don't have any evidence that the percentages would be different or slanted in this direction, but just for the sake of argument let's assume this directionality and magnitude.  So is OP TA for not reducing the possibility of an adverse event happening from 2% to 1%? 

Or what are you saying is the magnitude of the risk she should have known she was taking in not requesting a switch to a female roommate?"
legaladvice,ffi5oq3,t1_ffi34cw,1579965762.0,"The reason that income sharing agreements can work is because while they may have some students who don't get any jobs (and cost the schools money), the ones who do get jobs likely get paid well, and pay more than they would have if they had just paid for a bootcamp upfront.

If your argument is that they didn't deliver what they promised in their contract, then you'll need a lawyer to help make that argument.

Assume the cheapest might be a community college degree where you can get away paying $10k / year for 4 years = $40k.  That still implies OP would make $333k over that time, or $83k per year.  OP can afford a brief consult with a lawyer."
AmItheAsshole,ffi4un9,t1_ffi40b8,1579965121.0,"> But she could and should have switched.

What would your response be if OP had a female roommate, and that female roommate brought a bunch of guys and girls back to the room in the wee hours of the morning?  What if the female roommate had said ""I'm planning on partying really hard tonight"" and the boss said that OP could switch rooms if she wanted to? 

She *could* have changed rooms.  She also could have not taken this job.  She could also have gone into a different career field to avoid this specific incident.  The problem is not that she *could* have prevented it, but rather that the roommate was unprofessional.  Most of the time, people *could have* prevented bad things that happened.  In a car accident?  You could have been driving in a different lane and avoided the AH driver.  Got robbed on your way home?  You could have taken a different path.  The question is whether the original choice (whether or not to switch roommates) was made with the full knowledge of the consequences.  I would argue in OPs case it was not.  It's pretty clear that if the roommate had said ""I will be propping the door open and starting the afterparty in our room at 4 AM"" that OP would have switched rooms.  But that was not what she agreed to - she agreed to share a hotel room with a coworker that was the same gender but would presumably otherwise act in a professional manner. 

I mean, it's unprofessional to begin with for the company to require employees to have roommates.  In the US at least I would be shocked if that happened, that's so much liability for the company."
AmItheAsshole,ffi3qac,t1_ffi14w6,1579964205.0,"I'd go NTA to be honest.  Yes, she agreed to room with a male peer who presumably would act professionally throughout the business trip.  Regardless of gender, she didn't agree to have her roommate bring a bunch of strangers back after the clubs close.  This is 100% on the roommate.  It's not the fact that he's male that's the problem, it's the fact that he's an asshole that's the problem."
