>Q5.  
>  
>I think foreign military intervention needs to be severely reigned in  
>  
>I'm fairly certain on most of my stances, but this is actually the one I struggle with still, even after years of pondering the pros and cons. My personal philosophy has me advocating for the most amount of 'good' (happiness / prosperity) and the least amount of 'bad' (suffering / struggle). On one hand, I recognize that even 10% of the yearly budget towards international military intervention going towards domestic issues could help create a lot less suffering within USA, but I'm not sure if that's worth sacrificing the attempt to bring less suffering to the international stage (I could write pages on my thoughts here, so I'll try and shorten it up and skip to the point) I think I need to learn and hear more opinions here before I can start to really buckle down on my ideas. For my question:

I understand your point here, but all too often, we do more harm than good.  Those are the situations that I'm talking about. Especially considering the rise of ISIS after the US came in.

There are certainly situations where we can be the protectors, and I think there are cases where we should.  But there are issues happening all over the world, yet we seem singularly focused on the middle east and parts of Asia.  How much do you hear about US intervention in South America or Africa?

>If you can take 5% ($30 billion) of last year's military budget and remove it from military, where do you put that into instead? The caveat is healthcare is already funded in this scenario.

There's plenty of room for humanitarian aid.  Yes, sometimes we need to fight those who would fight us, or defend those who would unjustly harm others.  But there are also people, civilians, in some of these war torn areas that we just ignore basically.  So in my mind, the US came in, deposed officials, and to coin a phrase from GWB, we were greeted as liberators.  That much is the truth.  But we didn't support the recovery.  We left a power vacuum. Things got worse, the fighting got worse, people started dying, drone strikes, bombs, etc...  And what of the civilians who just wanted to live their lives? It is no surprise that more and more of them became radicalized against the US.  Their perceptions shifted, we were no longer the liberators, we were the agitators and aggressors.

So, if I were going to do as you suggest, I would put that money right back into the same areas, and perhaps even using the same military resources to help rebuild and stabilize these war-torn places. I see it as our responsibility at this point.  And I know that this diverges from my anti-intervention stance, but I feel we helped create the mess, we should help clean it up.

.

>\*\*Q6.\*\*What are your thoughts on 3d printed gun components? Does a restriction start to slip into treading on 2A rights?

I see that more as a first amendment rights violation as much as a second amendment concern. I'm somewhat torn on it, but ultimately I think we should stay out of legislating it until it becomes apparent that we need to.  So far, I haven't heard of a single case of a home 3D printed gun being used in any significant crime.  There are bigger issues to debate and solve.

.

>Q7. Do you live in a more rural or urban area?

Chicago - very urban.  I grew up in a area that was suburban but very close to the more rural farm areas until the population started exploding there.

>Last but not least:  
>  
>.  
>  
>Q8. You mentioned Republican a couple of times and I'm curious how you define 'Republican'?

Its nebulous to me even these days.  I thought I knew until I saw such fervent support for a person like Donald Trump.  I believe the republican party has drifted so far from what they once stood for or at least claimed to stand for.

I don't know that I have a simple definition, but in general, I would say a true republican is more fiscally and socially conservative.   I don't think the republican party we see today represents that any longer.  It is undeniable that they are also the party of big business these days.

What I see is a ton of propaganda and decision making that typically supports massive corporations and the immensely wealthy.  The regulations that are being rolled back, the actions toward the CPFB, EPA, FCC, not to mention the huge tax cuts for top earners all exemplify that.

None of those changes have been good for everyday citizens, but they will always position them as though they are.  They will tell you that there should be less government regulation in order to allow businesses to grow and operate freely.  But they conveniently forget that minimal regulation is what led to the economy crashing in the mid-late 2000's.

One other perception that I have is that it seems to be the party of choice for Christians.  I was going to type up a little bit more about it, but it's hard to get my thoughts out in a concise manner right now.

There's a little talk here about how the Republican party became the party of Evangelicals, and the importance of that over the last 50 years or so:  [https://www.npr.org/2019/11/14/779465137/who-is-an-evangelical-looks-at-history-of-evangelical-christians-and-the-gop](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/14/779465137/who-is-an-evangelical-looks-at-history-of-evangelical-christians-and-the-gop)

It is a fascinating topic to dive into a bit more if you've got the time.

>  
>government assistance programs, again, on the more fiscally conservative side. I think it's reasonable to put safeguards in place to prevent abuse.  
>  
>Can you clarify your use of abuse here? Do you mean abuse in the government inflating those budgets, or abuse by the recipients?

Mostly abuse by recipients and taking advantage of the system.  People who claim disability but are perfectly able to work.  People who don't truly need the assistance.  From what I understand, those abusers of the systems are in the minority, but if there's a way to further prevent people from collecting benefits that they don't need or shouldn't be entitled to, then I'm for that.  There are enough people who truly do need the assistance, and those are the people who should receive the benefits.

.

>Q2. What are your thoughts on Universal Basic Income (Yang's or just the general concept)

I don't know yet.  My gut reaction is that it seems like a bad idea. If universal basic income is necessary, then I think there is something wrong with the system, and we need to look deeper.  I've also read mixed reviews on how effective it has been in other places.

I understand the intent though - basic needs like food, water, shelter should ideally be available to everyone.  I just don't think universal basic income is the answer.

.

>Q3. What are your thoughts on drug legalization? Marijuana and all drug legalization?

I'm all for marijuana legalization.  I believe the effects of alcohol are much more severe in almost every way than marijuana.

When it comes to other drugs, I do think many should be illegal still, but I don't necessarily agree with the punishments.

Psychedelics like shrooms should probably be legalized as well. Again, they're relatively safe.

Things like heroin, meth, other super hard drugs should remain illegal.  However we need to approach them from two sides, and we're only really doing one right now.  Yes, we need police enforcement, but we also need more accessibility and availability of addition support services.

.

>Q4.  
>  
>I also think that if you use the argument that those people are receiving government money and so are subject to additional scrutiny, any congress person who votes for such scrutiny should be willing to subject themselves to the same.  
>  
>I haven't considered this aspect before. I'd like to hear your thoughts with an example, even if you can only think of an unrealistic scenario. How are those people held accountable? Do we use that additional scrutiny to help guide a decision on who should be voted in positions of power? If so, how would we, the electorate, use that knowledge?

For example, there was a big issue a while back about florida voting to give drug tests to people receiving welfare:  [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/us/no-savings-found-in-florida-welfare-drug-tests.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/us/no-savings-found-in-florida-welfare-drug-tests.html)

The idea was to disallow people who were using drugs from receiving the funds.  And in removing people from the services, the state would ultimately save money.  But it turns out that there weren't many cases of people receiving welfare being drug users.  So few in fact that the program to test recipients ended up costing the state more than they saved.  I believe that it was just a way to harass people on welfare - it ultimately did nothing except cost taxpayers money and cause those receiving benefits heartache.

The Daily Show did an awesome bit where they asked the state governor to subject himself to the same drug test - as he too receives money from the government - a taxpayer funded salary.  [http://www.cc.com/video-clips/vra301/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-poor-pee-ple](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/vra301/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-poor-pee-ple)"

Totally agree on all points. 

>> To be clear, I'm not anti-republican (in terms of what their political stances used to be), and in fact I used to be a more moderate voter
>
>1. I'm curious what you mean by this. Can you describe those political stances?

Sure:

Healthcare is very important to me, one of my top issues. I used to be pretty opposed to nationalized health care because I didn't believe that it was financially feasible. The more I've learned and looked into it, the more I realize that it may indeed solve the problem because the problem has a lot more to do with the insurance industry and the astronomical cost of medical care as compared to other countries.

I used to be more opposed to government assistance programs, again, on the more fiscally conservative side. I think it's reasonable to put safeguards in place to prevent abuse. I also think that if you use the argument that those people are receiving government money and so are subject to additional scrutiny, any congress person who votes for such scrutiny should be willing to subject themselves to the same. 

I'm very much in favor of protecting second amendment rights but I'm not rabid about it like some. I think there are reasonable precautions that we can take such as background checks, and certain stronger restrictions. I'm on the fence about assault weapons bans as I think they have a tendency to be too restrictive, but I don't know what a better answer would be to reduce the number of mass shootings. Still, you can do a lot of damage with a couple hand guns and a couple extra magazines, so I'm not sure if it will be the answer either.

I'm also very much in favor of equal rights. Personally, I don't care what people do or how they want to live their lives, or what feels right to them so long as it doesn't affect me negatively. I think governments being involved in marriage is a violation of the separation of church and state. There should be a separation between the governmental aspect (civil union for example) and religion based marriage. You can do both at the same time, but the government should have no say in two consenting adults getting married.

I think foreign military intervention needs to be severely reigned in, but I hate the way Trump has gone about it, especially with respect to Turkey and Iran. Obama was terrible on that front too. 

We absolutely must do something about climate change. Trump has been a disaster on that front. Rolling back EPA regulations instead of increasing pressure on business to do the right thing, pulling out of the Paris accord.

Healthcare, Climate change, and constant wars

PublicFreakout,fgaqvcd,t1_fg9e5d3,1580654345.0,Harrison Ford might have been a bad example here. I'm convinced he could possibly be a better candidate than at least half of the options we've been presented with in primaries for the last two elections
CrappyDesign,fg8so9c,t1_fg8qcz2,1580629037.0,Even the mouse? That's crazy to me. Typically Apple products are in design/media related functions or businesses. Artists can be very particular about their tools. Seems odd to me that a person couldn't purchase their own mouse if they wanted.

PublicFreakout,fg8qu8z,t1_fg7m3cv,1580628238.0,Noob noob was also held in contempt of court for his disrespectful remarks.
PublicFreakout,fg8qk90,t1_fg7l4cq,1580628106.0,"It isn't technically illegal in and of itself. Look up ""contempt of court"". Basically, a judge can order that a person be jailed in their courtroom at any time - usually for being disruptive, disrespectful, or refusing to follow a court order. If it's something minor, they will usually give you a warning or tell you to leave the room. 

The judge said 93 days just to scare the shit out of the woman and help her understand just how disgustingly disrespectful she was being. Realistically, the woman was only going to serve a day or two of time, which is exactly what happened. She was released within about 24 hours after she apologized to the court."

PublicFreakout,fg8pcvp,t1_fg8chwx,1580627464.0,The lady actually was out in about a day after she apologized. The 93 days thing was just to send a message. She was never going to serve 93 days for that.
PublicFreakout,fg8p62u,t1_fg8cwhz,1580627342.0,"Sometimes they do. In this case the judge decided that the level of disrespect was so egregious that it warranted a contempt charge. She said 93 days to scare the woman. It was more like 24 hours that the woman spent in jail.

However, there are cases where a court can hold a person until they comply with the court's orders."

battlestations,fg7vbfk,t1_fg7nxoc,1580602368.0,"Wild. Something similar happened to me. Not quite to that extent, but I had a skull fracture when I was 12. It was a stupid accident, but a portion of my skull collapsed into my sinus cavity and actually put some pressure on my brain. Luckily the sinus acted like an airbag for my brain - anywhere else on my head and it could have been much more serious. Reconstructive surgery on my skull, same deal ear-to-ear scar across the top of my head. My surgeon used some self disintegrating stitches internally and surgical staples across the top of my head. Scar is mostly hidden by my hair, but it'll show up as my hair keeps falling out lol.

But yeah, I think it was two or three weeks in the hospital because they didn't want me to get any sort of infection and wanted to make sure brainy parts still think good."

 At that point, I would say that it's not a right, but I'm just arguing semantics. I say that because government doesn't prevent you from traveling in general, but they may prevent you from driving a car on public roads. 

I agree with your analogy though. 

Although I suppose there are exceptions to every government granted right. Freedom of speech is a guaranteed right, but slander and libel are still illegal as is making certain threats.

Hmmm... Maybe you're right after all."

Your crazy SC laws you're quoting mention travel, but seem to be silent on driving a car. Therefore, my position is that your interpretation of your own crazy ""laws"" is wrong.

bullybackfire,fg5z0se,t1_fg5xvg7,1580545191.0,"As many as you like. Making the same argument over and over doesn't make it a good argument. The fact is, there is enough context to decide how you feel about the situation and how you want to interpret it.

If you want to interpret it as ""the woman had it coming"", that's fine. But there's zero evidence for that. On the other hand, you could just interpret what was shown in the video - a man suddenly becoming aggressive with a woman and hitting her, and another man stepping in. There's your context.  If that's not enough for you to draw any sort of conclusion at all, then I genuinely worry for you.  Seriously. Because I can't imagine how you'd react if something like that happened in your life. Hopefully you wouldn't just sit back and wait for more context. 

There's plenty of information in the video to draw an initial conclusion. It's also possible to change your mind later if presented with new or different information. Until I'm presented with evidence to the contrary, I know my stance. 

You can call me names all you want. It doesn't make you any more right about the situation. It doesn't help you make your point."

Yes. I disagree with you. You haven't made a single persuasive argument. You keep going back to context. A sane and reasonable person is perfectly capable of making reasonable assumptions using context clues and previous experience.
