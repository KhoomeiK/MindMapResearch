but it probably has something to do with the current surrounding Antarctica.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circumpolar_Current#Structure

here's an article from scientific American 

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-reason-antarctica-is-melting-shifting-winds-driven-by-global-warming/

Climate scientists first began to notice that all was not right with West Antarctica’s ice a couple of decades ago, but its melt proved a bit enigmatic. For the most part, air temperatures are still too cold for surface melting to explain why the ice is thinning. That fact suggested the ocean was likely the culprit—yet the top layer of seawater is also too cold to thaw the ice. And while there is a deeper layer of warm ocean water that sometimes reaches the Amundsen Sea and laps away at the undersides of two giant glaciers in the region—called Pine Island and Thwaites—rising global temperatures were not directly warming that water.

“This is an area where the [warm] ocean waters that melt the ice have been out of contact with the atmosphere for thousands of years,” explains Paul Holland, an ice-ocean scientist at the British Antarctic Survey and one of the authors of the new study. “They're very old waters, so they wouldn’t have been [heated] by global warming.” Thus, the question for Holland and his team was if—and how—climate change had affected these deep-ocean waters. They suspected that wind might be the missing connection.
Holland and his colleagues combined wind data, satellite observations of sea-ice drift and climate-model simulations to understand how wind patterns near Antarctica have evolved since the 1920s (which is how far back the simulations extend) and how any changes may have affected glaciers that flow into the Amundsen Sea. They compared different simulations to parse which effects came from natural fluctuations in the climate versus anthropogenic climate change.
They found that wind patterns indeed appear to have changed over the past century—and in a way that can explain the increased melting of the West Antarctic ice sheet. In the 1920s, the team reports, the winds over the Amundsen Sea would have predominantly blown toward the west, mostly keeping the warm ocean water at bay. But today the wind patterns flip-flop between blowing eastward and westward. When the waters blow toward the east, the deep layer of warm ocean water can creep in. “When the wind blows east, you get these rivers of warm water coming into the [Amundsen Sea] and melting the ice,” Holland explains. “It’s basically like turning on a hot tap when the wind blows toward the east and turning off the tap when the wind blows toward the west.”"
