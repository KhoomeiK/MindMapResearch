werewolves,ffbcp7q,t3_eskltp,1579759835.0,"8-10 minutes. Your genetics and body type also play some part in it. The 8-10 minutes is a rough estimate for someone of average weight and health. Height doesn’t matter all that much in the length of your transformation. But of course, if you have more to change, it’s gonna take a bit longer. Short people luck out in this. If you’re overweight or obese, you’re gonna be there screaming for a lot longer and you’re gonna end up as a mostly chonky boy. If you even survive, that is. Underweight people also have a problem. Where can you gather energy from? Not from many places, so the transformation is gonna be a lot more energy consuming and longer. Better eat an extra large sandwich atleast a hour before the moon goes up.

Speeding it up is well, kinda pointless. You just risk really hurting yourself in the process if you try to ”push” it out faster. It does work but the body can do only so much. Think like it’s squeezing ketchup from a mostly empty bottle. You can’t get it all out at once, you have to wait for it to drop down, then squeeze. Holding it works to some degree, but that isn’t recommended either. Just let it happen and focus on maintaining control. Unless you’re really in a hurry, or somewhere with people you would like to stay alive."

werewolves,ff6rrk8,t3_erxa8r,1579633518.0,"She took almost leaping steps, leading her deeper and deeper into the forest. The scar of the bite burned with more and more intensity. She knew the time was coming, just from the headaches and other pains. Her breathing grew more and more distressed. Her mind was replaying the events of the night that put her into this whole mess. She looked down at her phone to check how long she’d have to walk. She couldn’t afford running. The ground is too uneven for that.

The memory is getting more accurate each time it plays. Every detail, down to the single leaf. Every little bruise and drop of blood. The bite. That nasty bite that hurt more than anything she had ever experienced. She couldn’t stand it anymore and rolled up a sleeve to look at the scar. Nothing. Not even red. She rolled the sleeve back down as she was nearly where she needed to get to. They could help her with this. Hopefully it wouldn’t be too late by the time she got there. 

Her mind was just empty enough again for the memory to play again. To make her feel even more stressed out and scared. Now it felt like she was reliving that same fateful night. The monstrous thing running behind her, breathing loudly while making sounds that sound like barking but not quite. No. She doesn’t want another reminder, and tries to clear out her head.

But it’s no use. She has to watch it again. Her panicked panting drowns into the howling wind that’s pushing against her. The thing is still after her. The werewolf. She can feel it. She’s just barely out of its reach. Until an unfortunate rock lands in her path. She unwillingly dove right into the dirt and bare roots of the trees. The werewolf stepped over her, its claws stinging her back.

Not again, she begged silently. She had seen and experienced it too many times now, but the memory keeps going. She lifted her face from the moist dirt and foliage, only to see 2 hairy feet with massive claws for nails. She didn’t even have time to look up before the werewolf grabbed and pulled her up by her hair. Face to face. She could smell and taste the death and blood on its breath. All she could let out was a small whimper.

The wolf then opened its mouth, ready to take a bite. She instinctively raised her arms, which just made the werewolf bite into one of them. She didn’t know if it was her bloodcurdling scream, the well timed lightning strike, or just something else which drove the beast to drop her and run away. Leaving her wounded and bleeding on the wet ground.

She sighs from some relief, which is followed by more relief, and then full shock. She reached her destination. An open, even patch in the middle of nowhere. But there is nothing there. No one else. No one to help her. They lied to her. Said the place would help. The alarm she set to ring started. She turned it off and threw the phone. Not even sure how to feel anymore. Angry, sad, happy? She looked at the full moon with her arms spread. Just embracing its mind numbing, overwhelming beauty."
