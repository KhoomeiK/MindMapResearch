For that matter we can’t say for sure that she would just automatically absorb her memories back. Because there’s the possibility that she only absorbed the memories because Namine was fixing Sora’s memory.

In KH3 she is just a replica made up of leftover data, no memories should be in her. And no power either yet she still wields a Keyblade. There’s also no evidence of her stealing Sora’s powers or taking her memories from him. The evidence points to her already having a heart, but no memory of anything."
