AskReddit,ff4kub0,t3_erhu3x,1579566048.0,"I once dreamt I was dating a high luxury model with whom I used to travel from my native South america to Europe back and forth. Life was just perfect, and I was starting to get used to it when my alarm went off and I woke up in my filthy 2m*2m bedroom with my boring depressed life. 

I tried for the life of me to get back to the dream but there was no use. It's already been 3 years and I never woke up from a dream feeling as dispaired and helpless as that time. I still bring it up from time to time"

Learn to feel okay and safe with the notion that you're already moving towards a version of you whose skin you'll feel at home with and won't feel the need to jump out of (or not as often at least).

I'm here with you for every single step of the way if you need someone, just DM."

I hope you and yours have fine days ahead"

argentina,fdwt7fw,t1_fdso9ca,1578762097.0,"Literalmente, si vos estás en la ""miseria"", imaginate cómo esta el resto.

Haciendo eco de otro comment que te dejaron acá, vengo ganando 16k hace dos años, y alquilo y me mantengo solo. Lamentablemente es la realidad de muchos hoy en día tener que andar contando las monedas. No creo que sacarle la guita a la gente a puro impuesto sea la solución, solo te comento esto para que pienses antes de catalogar tu sueldo como ""miseria"" y entiendas que, en la realidad actual que maneja este país, tenés suerte."
AskReddit,fdw7em3,t1_fduogdc,1578755880.0,"Just a little follow up on this, I used to be a huge Stephen King fan and people who despise his works usually don't realize the underlinings that the stories present.

This horror novel that seems supernatural? it's actually about substance abuse, loneliness and depression. The man just has a knack to hide it in plain sight."
SuicideWatch,fdw4xbt,t3_en8bhe,1578755107.0,"Hey, I've been like that in my days as well, you just keep picturing these situations and thoughts in your head and it hurts a shit ton because of course you'll think the worst out of you right now; your current mindset is literally gonna push you towards thinking like that.

There's nothing wrong with feeling like you need help. Take a moment to realize that this is you thinking about taking care of yourself, and that that's a step forward to feeling better."
SuicideWatch,fdw0sib,t3_en3mit,1578753833.0,"Hey, don't underestimate the power a hug can have in you.

I find that being embraced makes me feel safe, cared for and like im worth something to someone.
The thing is, eventually you'll learn to fill yourself with that energy, that confidence that a hug can give you, but only when you realize that that very same hug comes from the love or care that said person has for you.
I feel like I spent way too long not recognizing my peers and family's affection as love; something in my head just didn't make that translation for me. Empathy can be a huge tool to keep at hand; it'll help you not waste the loving of others and learn to take the best out of it.

I'd like to believe that my days of thinking about suicide have been put on hold for a while, or at least I hope so. All of these ideas are currently helping me out.

I'd give you a hug, my friend, no matter wherever you are in the world."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fc3593d,t1_fc2wuil,1577381757.0,"Hey bud, ever been to /r/leaves ? Might be the answer you're looking for. 

Btw I don't think it's very cool for you to be smoking if you don't wanna, just 'cause your friends be smoking.
Do it only when and if you feel like it, and if any of 'em try to peer pressure you, you should learn to recognize it and throw it back at 'em, gently.

I don't mean to tell you what to do or how to do it, just a little observation for a fellow ent who might be in need."
