HumansBeingBros,ffgfnow,t1_ffgaxzn,1579905169.0,I have really tiny hands that are always cold. Once I snuck up behind a friend 3x my size and quickly wrapped all my little fingers around one of his sausage fingers. I’ve never seen that man shriek so loudly or move so quickly. Luckily he laughed it off instead of breaking all my fingers.

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffgd3gv,t1_ffga2pf,1579903563.0,Yeah i was wondering how confusing that must be to a young child when your siblings have a douchebag variety pack of Dads.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffgcolu,t1_ffgca5c,1579903308.0,Yeah i know better than to wear high waisted jeans with a cutoff sweatshirt. It makes me feel like Mike Wazowski.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffg1r8i,t1_ffg1dq5,1579896583.0,Right??! Wheres your boo? Oh hes just scoring goals and talking shit to children on xbox. I never have to worry where he is or who hes talking to.
beyondthebump,ffg0eek,t1_ffexi2c,1579895749.0,"Yes! My babies love my big pink contigo waterbottle. But its so heavy when its full and I worry about them dropping it on their little toes. So I purchased two mini versions with the “click open/closed” option. They still oooh and aaaah at the pink bottle, but the little bottles work as a perfect substitution/distraction."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffc8cl6,t1_ffavpx1,1579793865.0,I do that too!! She sounds like she talks with rocks in her mouth.
MadeMeSmile,ff7fegk,t3_eruo1v,1579648288.0,"How many nostrils you need, Miss Alicia Haithe?"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff70e4j,t1_ff65up4,1579638608.0,I agree. I could see her collecting & trading silly bands and cute smelly erasers with friends at school. Then riding bikes around with neighberhood kids.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff6zq4f,t1_ff6719x,1579638219.0,"You never really know with kids though. My friends have posted hundreds of insta-perfect pictures & videos of their kids. They look & sound so smart, sweet, quiet, and adorable. But plenty of times I’ve met the kids and ... well .... they’re loud, spoiled, and dumb.

(I’m not trying to insult the kids, just stating my opinion). An example is how angelic little Ryder seems when shes around her mom. Then as soon as she doesnt get her way, she is inconsolable. Yes kids have bad days, especially when its close to nap time, but that little girl is definitely not as innocent & behaved as she looks. She gets SO much love and attention that it makes sense why she believes the world revolves around her. Because ”at the end of the day, it’s all about Ryder”.

EDIT: And yes, parents should focus their energy towards making their childrens lives better. However - there is a time when a parent should be able to put their foot down and say “no” without the child ripping a phone out the wall at an air b&b and yelling “MINE!”"
