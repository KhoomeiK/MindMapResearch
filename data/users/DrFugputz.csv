todayilearned,fcwsyc9,t1_fcwgoqq,1578036337.0,I thought sailing around the world didn't happen again until... Cook? Will have to check this guy out!
todayilearned,fcwswj6,t3_ej92qw,1578036278.0,"To be fair, though, Magellan did the heavy lifting. He was captaining the armada through unknown waters. The guys who made it back were sailing through known seas, though they were narrowly dodging hostile Portuguese ships along the way. The first guy to travel around the world, if not circumnavigate it, was Enrique of Malacca, Magellan's slave. I guess when they showed up in the Philippines everybody was pleasantly shocked when Enrique was able to communicate with the natives... he had been enslaved from there as a boy and later purchased by Magellan."
