AskReddit,ff969z5,t1_ff6rph1,1579705844.0,"Not who you asked and in the US, but I get pec massages because my whole upper body gets issues not just my back, so this means my masseuse touches my breasts. He doesn't touch the nipples though, and looks away while he's massaging.

askwomenadvice,ff5v5hp,t3_erpuws,1579611335.0,"Soap isn’t needed as the vagina is self cleaning. Soap/fragrances can actually cause serious issues. If she has odors it’s more likely to be an issue inside the vagina, like yeast infection. She needs to be using hot water on her underwear and perhaps a sensitive skin formula detergent. Some ladies are extra sensitive to fragrance and detergent and yes things can get irritated down there. I personally have to use a free and clear detergent and I don’t use fabric softeners. I also get irritation from deodorant so I pick sensitive skin formulas or fragrance free and I also have to rotate them out every few weeks or I will start breaking out in a rash on my underarms."

How does he treat you in real life? Does he take issue with you doing things without him or try to control who you see and where you go, or do you both have healthy lives outside of each other?"
AskWomen,ff3l2wd,t3_eqvpek,1579543334.0,"""This is terrible""/ ashamed/ upset. 

My mother hadn't talked to me much about it, and I got my period age 11 at my grandmother's house while on a month long vacation. I woke up, took a step out of bed, HUGE amount of blood and clots fell out of me and onto the beige carpet. I was so ashamed and tried desperately to clean the carpet and clean myself and my clothes. Luckily it was time for a trip into town for groceries, as my granny only did that once a month. I kept trying to steer her to the feminine product aisle but was too embarrassed to say why. Finally she figured it out and after I stared at the aisle for a solid minute she said, ""Well what do you normally buy?"" and I broke down crying and said ""I don't knooowwww!!!"" So she shoved a few things in the buggy and we left. 

When my mother picked me up a few weeks later she was upset with me. I guess I had developed breasts somewhat and she got mad at me for it. She made me feel like my body was something to be ashamed of, that I should feel bad, that I had done something wrong, and it had a lifelong impact on me.

I encourage everyone to normalize menstruation and puberty because no one should have to go through such trauma."
AskWomen,ff3kjy0,t3_eqxwpp,1579543012.0,"Doing yardwork and he wanted to take a break and go inside but I said I was okay and would keep working, but told him he should go inside and take all the time he needed, no big deal. Apparently that insulted his masculinity or something. 

Also same guy got upset because I put a pan in the oven in a way that it clanged on the metal rack, on accident. It 'meant I was upset at him'. ?? 

Also if I didn't sit a certain way or if my face looked a certain way it 'meant I was upset, at him specifically'. 

Yeah, that relationship did not work out."
AskReddit,fephmfr,t3_eq9k9o,1579320717.0,"Stone Temple Pilots circa 2008. He was too fucked up to concentrate on anything. Told jokes that were just sentences strung together. Didn’t sing well. Very sad. 

I also saw Fuel more than once. The first time they were great. The last time, it was after the lead singer had had a lot of vocal chord trouble and he couldn’t hit or hold a lot of notes and it made me depressed. 

A Perfect Circle sounded good but performed the entire set behind a screen and you couldn’t see anything, so... that one was weird."

She found them stuffed in a hole under her sons mattress and was horrified. But, turns out he really enjoys dressing as a woman and didn’t know how else to go about getting women’s clothing as his family is very religious and he was ashamed. Once everything was out in the open though, the family eventually came to mostly accept the son as he was and now he is openly dressing in women’s clothing and very happy. The key was communication."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fcv0tnq,t3_eiwp42,1577992333.0,"Yes go get a check up, discuss contraceptives, and start getting familiar with Pap smears. I waited a few years to start going and turns out I had cervical cancer from HPV. No symptoms. Going to the doctor just wasn’t something we did in my family unless it was something serious. But the whole point of preventative checkups and tests is so you can handle things before they become a bigger problem. If my abnormal cervical cells had been caught earlier I would have had a fairly simple procedure to remove them. But instead I had to have an expensive hospital procedure where they sliced out part of my cervix and now I have scar tissue that causes me pain and I would likely have trouble having kids. Obviously this is a rare case, but I always tell people it’s better to be safe than sorry. If you’re not okay with a male, ask for referrals to a female gyno or doctor."

And though I cannot find the proof of me specifically, I am sure my photos have also been shared without my consent. There is no coming back from that. And no, he showed no remorse. I absolutely believe it stems from his low self esteem and seeking validation, but it's 100% not okay and I told him if I found proof of him sharing pics of me I would go to the police."

I would always run to that wall and call for help and no one ever listened. It’s absolutely maddening when no one wants to “get involved” or it’s “none of their business”. I also got choked til I almost passed out, in the middle of Walmart in my home town, again...nothing. He said, “see, no one cares what I do to you” and he was right. Things like that make it even harder to leave an abusive relationship because you really do feel like no one cares and you’re worthless.

askwomenadvice,fcn9zhn,t3_ehxkrq,1577807040.0,"I don’t enjoy fingering much. However, sex is different. There’s more going on than something just being inside you. Your clit is often rubbing against something or you can touch it for extra stimulation. A penis is different than fingers and reaches different places and feels a different way. I like to move my hips and grind against someone and then I’m getting a lot of clitoral stimulation as well as penetration that feels good to me, less of an “in and out” and more of a moving around. 

Honestly it just takes a little time and experimenting to find what feels good for you. I never finger myself when masturbating, doesn’t do anything for me. When someone else fingers me it gets old quickly unless they are also licking my clit or I am rubbing it myself. 

I almost exclusively use toys for masturbation. Look into a vibrator that has an additional piece that goes against your clit. Those are really nice."

Yes ideally she’d back off on someone who has a girlfriend, but that’s not always how it works out. It’s up to your boyfriend to set boundaries, and cut contact if she will not respect them. The issue is your boyfriend isn’t cutting contact when she keeps pushing and he knows this upsets you. It’s disrespectful to you. If she was nothing special then he’d have no issues just blocking her. Sounds like he enjoys the attention or he wants to keep his options open.  Either way it’s an issue. You’ve told him what your expectations and boundaries are and he doesn’t seem to care. Don’t get mad at this girl, get mad at him. Or both of them. But for sure hold him accountable too.
