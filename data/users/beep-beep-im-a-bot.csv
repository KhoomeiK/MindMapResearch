So how confident are you that a second, third of forth re-write won’t be necessary ?

I find It worrying that It doesn’t look like this test net is going particularly well and it’s not even the final testnet and it’s already 2020.

cardano,fdpagnv,t1_fdp4j7b,1578623783.0,"That’s what you hope, i doubt  it though. I’ve followed this project closely from the beginning and it looks like there has been a colossal problem identified with the Haskell code and plan B was put into action. It’s possibly the problem was the code was far too slow and the the ability to train up coders took far too long whilst the early attempts to hit the target were far too wide of the mark and cardano will be written mostly in Rust. 

This of course hasn’t been admitted yet but if Haskell isn’t implemented and we are left with a project sold on Haskell but botched by rust we have been mis-sold an inferior product."
