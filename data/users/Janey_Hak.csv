Borderline,fghu32d,t3_eykr8f,1580793894.0,"We can’t diagnose anyone, including your mother. It sounds like she’s been emotionally abusive to you for your whole life. Maybe she does have her own trauma or diagnosis, but it seems like she’s in no way ready to admit that or explore it with a therapist or talk about it. Having borderline does not equal or excuse being abusive in the way that she has been. So it’s not too relevant because she’s not going to accept help or reconsider her actions. 

My view is that you need to take care of yourself until you are able to get away from your mum. Maybe this means when you finish school you get a job and share an apartment with friends, or go away to college, I’m not sure of your situation. But I really think that she’s not taking care of you, she’s actively hurting you more, and it’s bad enough that you should get out as soon as you can. 

Do you have an older sibling or aunt or family friend or some other adult (doesn’t seem like your Dad is helpful) that you could talk to for some help? Is your dads family better? Maybe your mums family know what she’s like and would help you? Do you have other friends who want to move out of home as soon as they’re old enough? 

Besides all of this - I want you to know that you are not alone. What she is doing is majorly shitty. I believe you. It is not your fault. You deserve a loving caring supportive family and home. You do not have to stay in touch with anyone who is abusive like this, even if they’re your mother, even if they’re dying of cancer or blah blah blah excuses to try and get you to come back so they can be awful to you again. You never ever have to put up with that. You are your own person and you get to make that decision. 

Keep talking to your therapist. I’m assuming you’re in the USA and I’m not sure on the mandatory reporting laws - I think they only have to disclose information to parents/social services/police if they believe you are in danger, from yourself or someone else e.g. a parent, or they think you are a danger to someone else. I’m not sure if what’s happening to you is enough for social services to be called, sorry I don’t know enough about those rules, I’m in Australia. 

Please come back and keep talking if you want to. There are lots of people on reddit who will listen and talk and we care about you. This is not fair and it sucks, but you are strong and you can make it through. Stay safe friend."
trashy,fghcwsa,t1_fgg7arn,1580782035.0,"An Aussie guy made a documentary called “that sugar film” or possibly “that sugar movie”. He went into the history of the sugar industry and how it’s been pushed as an ingredient despite us knowing how bad it is. It’s as disturbing as alcohol, tobacco and guns. He visited the states and met a dentist with a mobile clinic who was treating patients with “Mountain Dew mouth”, first time I had heard of it. It was terrifying to watch. He then went to a remote regional community in Australia, where there is only one store to buy food and drink, and looked at the health implications when you have no food choices. Like the “food deserts” in big cities where you can’t find fresh food for many blocks, this community was in the actual desert that a lot of Australia is. It is very expensive to truck in fresh fruit and veg thousands of kilometres to a small town, where people with low income cannot afford the high prices to offset that transport cost. So of course people bought the cheapest and easiest food. The cemetery was full of people who died far too young from diabetes related conditions. A government program was started so the only store started selling healthy foods, at affordable prices, there were cooking glasses and free drinking water taps. But then the funding for the program stopped and it just went back to how it was. 

It’s so fucked how people have the odds stacked so much against them from the start. Not to disempower people, but it’s clear to me that by growing up in certain locations and circumstances, a lot of people have a lot to work against to get to a healthier point.
