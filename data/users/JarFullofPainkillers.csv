bulletjournal,femn5im,t1_femjzos,1579263349.0,"It’s your personal preference, but keeping track of sex along with your period is a good way to notice patterns on your cycle. For example, you can feel more frisky during certain times throughout the month than others, so it’s good to see if there’s a correlation. Not to mention that it’s an easy way to plan for a pregnancy or avoid it. 

The period app I use actually has more information on it. If you have the app Clue, you can go into the sex track and press i for more info. It’s one of my favorite apps because of the info it gives you on the things you track. C:"

To be honest, this is my first time bullet journaling so I just went to Walmart and bought a cheap one. If I’m not mistaken, it’s from class act stationery. Though I tried to look for it online and couldn’t find the exact same one I have."

bulletjournal,fejyttt,t3_epcyzr,1579188944.0,"Thank you! I just started and I’m still on the skeleton of the journal, but I’m using it as I go. Though some sections are not fully made yet. 

Thanks for your kind words!"
bulletjournal,fejyqf9,t1_fejvnq8,1579188884.0,"Haha, glad I could be of help. :’D"
bulletjournal,fejo0yb,t1_fejnrl2,1579181251.0,"Actually I don’t, I’m sorry. 

But what I did was use the dot grid of the journal and some math to calculate the positioning so that it’s centered, and literally connected the dots to make the shapes. I also did a skeleton of it in a light pencil mark first until I was happy, then I lined it with a fineliner pen and, once it dried, erased the pencil marks. 

If you zoom in and notice, the numbers and the calendars are lined with the dots. If you have a dotted journal you can use those to your advantage. 

Also, a ruler for the crisp lines, lol. Hope this helps you out a bit. C:"

Thank you for your encouraging words! I’m so happy you guys like it."
bulletjournal,fejhe1w,t1_feiy8b9,1579174338.0,Thank you! After I posted this I added some last details to the key page and now it’s done done for real! Even though it takes me for ever I find it super satisfying.

AskWomen,fdz8pld,t1_fdz7fj8,1578787775.0,"I mean, I didn’t like Tamlin either. My favorite character is actually Lucien. I find that he’s, ironically enough, the most human. 

I’ve not read the novella yet. I literally have it next to me but I’m just... I can’t read any more ACoTaR. I need a palette cleanser one shot."

AskWomen,fcukkc4,t1_fcujh4v,1577983077.0,"Omg, literally opposites! The second book was the hardest one for me to read. The first and third were the best imo. 

My issue was that I didn’t like Feyre at all. And the second book is too much about her and not plot oriented as much as the first and third ones. I feel the world of ACoTaR has so much potential and instead it’s too focused on her person. I’ve been told that that’s the purpose of the story itself, it’s a romantic fantasy or whatever after all. But I was a lot more excited for the plot itself. And in the second book barely anything happens that has to do with the actual plot. 

Feyre herself I just don’t like her. Her personality and mine don’t click, I find her too stubborn, naive, and after she was turned I feel she lacked flaws that made her relatable. It was too perfect, and everything catered around her sometimes. It was frustrating to me. And, like I said before, since the book is written in first person it was a real struggle to read. When you don’t like someone you don’t want to have to see anything through their eyes, and that’s all that happened with her. 

Basically I felt the story had a lot of unused potential that was lost to focus instead on a character that, as the story progresses, seems to turn less and less relatable. 

What about you? Since we’re opposites here is like to hear what you think too. C:"
AskWomen,fct8dnz,t3_eisd24,1577935595.0,"“A Court of Frost and Starlight” by Sarah J. Mass

I chose it because it’s the last book of that series that I’ve yet to read and I want to be done with it. I enjoyed the first book, but I mostly hate read the rest of the series. Not badly written, just never really liked the main character which, considering it’s written in first person, made it hard to connect to the story fully."
suggestmeabook,fciif3d,t1_fci62lc,1577663071.0,"I’m glad this series was mentioned because I was about to mention it to you. It’s honestly a good read, plus each book is about the size of the first Harry Potter book, maybe a little thinner, so they should be easy reads. Plus it’s dark and scary like you’d like, but also marketed to young adults so it’s a relatively easy read too. I personally am not a big fan of fantasy books and yet I own every single book in this series. I think you’ll like it so I second this option."
spirograph,fcigj78,t3_eh43ux,1577662194.0,Yes. This is awesome. I love the colors too.
