creepyPMs,fftjqqh,t1_ffteqax,1580222363.0,">why the hate for feminists?

I understand the basic idea of feminism and I think it's needed in countries where women have no rights, like Saudi Arabia and other Middle East countries.

But in civilized countries? Yes, there are still areas where women are not equal to men. But there is no big system ""patriarchy"" behind. There are too many reasons that feminists a lot of times don't want to see and rather blame just patriarchy. Also I do believe that the world would be just as bad if the roles were reversed.

The word feminism is a problem itself. While it can also be used to address men, it's commonly not used for that.

Above all I prefer equality or even more so equal chances for all people. No matther their gender, skin color or heritage. This means not only that women should have equal chances to men but vice versa. There are a lot of areas where men are still in disadvantage. For example child custody.

But we also have to consider biological differences between woman and men. Men are generally stronger and are more useful on hard labour. Women may get pregnant and since they carry the next generations, they need to be protected.

And men are more driven by sexual hormones. While most of us have learned to keep those in check, there still are a lot that harass females, because they can't control their sex drive. Yes, mostly men.

But most of us can. And you still focus on those who don't and put men in one bucket. And this is what pisses me off. You did say ""not all men"" and still your attacking the gender instead of just this one idiot who happens to be male. And yes men do this kind of generalisation, too."
