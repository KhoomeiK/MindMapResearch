Love our little therapy felines. We're so lucky."

relationships,ff4wycv,t1_ff489wy,1579574435.0,"Yeah, I was raised by a super controlling and violent as hell mother with so many rules and constant hovering. I never felt like I was trusted in my own home, so by the time I hit 15 I was like fuck it, if I'm gonna be treated this way I may as well have fun and do what I want. Since my mom was always overreacting, I didn't trust her judgement when she said no, nor would I trust that she had my best interests at heart and more that she wanted to be right and control me. I was a really good socially awkward total overachiever in school like sports, arts, math contests, insanely good grades, even worked part time. But yep, also started smoking weed at 15 and binge drinking to feel some escape and had major self-esteem issues that made me easy prey for shitty dudes. My younger sister? She left the house at 16 to escape my mother's controlling right into the arms of a 31 year old pedophile. She did come back a year later and never got pregnant nor dropped out of school and had a normal teenage life as much as she could, but it definitely messed my sister up for a long time.

Cautionary tale right here folks."

TwoXChromosomes,fewm8mj,t1_fewa7j8,1579414406.0,Yes! Thank you. It's infuriating that some people will only see other's point of view once they're stuck in their circumstances. Complete lack of empathy until they're personally affected.

My mom got her engineering degree in our home country, and made sure she got accredited and approved by our provincial engineering body to receive her iron ring 5 hours before my ceremony, so she could be the one to give me my iron ring.

It was such a symbolic moment, we cried so much when she handed it to me. One of the happiest moments of my life.

Now whenever people notice our iron rings she can't wait to tell everyone about what it means and how she got hers and I got mine."

You want people to respect your way of living? You can't be putting down other people's choices as bad because you can't understand how they'd make anyone happy, aka they'd never make you happy. You're basically acting just like your acquaintances."

TrollXChromosomes,fby2wma,t1_fbq48vg,1577206783.0,"Oh shit, are you possibly talking about the Vasa museum in Stockholm? I visited 2 years ago, and one of the exhibitions was about showing the less talked about but very important role women had in the construction of the ship and in the society in general. Many of the labour jobs were also done by women out of sheer necessity, sometimes from the more wealthy noble classes the women would be the bankrollers and signing or approving things in their husbands stead.

I absolutely loved it."
