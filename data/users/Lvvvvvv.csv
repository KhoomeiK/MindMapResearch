desabafos,ff9dnfx,t1_ff71t0w,1579710728.0,Boderline também é hardcore. Li que passa ou tende a melhorar depois dos 40. Foca nisso. Te aprecio pelo seu comentário.
BipolarReddit,ff9c87l,t1_ff98bfj,1579709679.0,"Thank you for this throughout answer! 
I started risperidone 3 weeks ago and quetiapine 2 days ago. I guess I’m gonna switch. I generally take no antipsychotic. 

I’ll try the subreddit. Truly, many thanks!"
BipolarReddit,ff8v7d5,t1_ff8tdhi,1579697211.0,"A doctor told me fasting (which I love to do) raises the noradrenaline and I don’t want that. Portion reduction is so much harder; just resisting is next to impossible. 

Good luck with your diet!"

bipolar,ff8huwb,t3_es63sh,1579679179.0,"The story of your brother is very common. The relapse when travelling might be because he wasn’t taking his medication properly. That has happened to me when I flew to Rome to see the Pope and ended up living on the streets for 5 days. It was like I’ve been hypnotized. 

The best advice I can give him is cut down stress. Although I too relapse every year. 

Good luck and thank you for being such a good brother. I too was the popular Big Sis, now I’m happy if I just survive."

I took xanax last year for 2 weeks and ended up in the hospital with withdraw, having to wean of lorazepam for 3 weeks. I keep reminding myself of that, because - as much as the panic is bad - I keep hearing benzos can make it even worse. Much worse. 

I take 2 lorazepam in my emergency meds bag, but I refrain from reaching out to it. Hope I can continue to soldier on. Otherwise I‘ll be getting into the last years of my life - as least that‘s how I see it.
