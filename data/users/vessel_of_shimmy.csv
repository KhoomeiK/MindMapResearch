aww,fd4hvjv,t1_fd3e5u8,1578167613.0,"His veterinarian and I donâ€™t think so. Heâ€™s just...a bit of a weirdo. Pica in animals besides humans is usually due to a dietary insufficiency or illness. The Colonelâ€™s bloodwork is always very healthy. In my experience Iâ€™ve found that some animals find the adhesive used for plastic bag handles very attractive. One barium follow-through for a handle of a plastic bag was enough for us. Not cheap! We did have a kitty several years ago who developed pica (clay litter) and obsessive grooming at the same time. He had lymphoma. With getting him to the vet early and starting chemo early he went into remission! If you want to see Colonel and his big olâ€™ feet I think a recent post I made to 
r/curledfeetsies should be at the top of my post history. Thank you for being concerned about The Colonel!!!"
aww,fd33vn5,t1_fd2imny,1578154497.0,"And peaches, and cherries, and bananas, and watermelon, and kefir, and yogurt, and plastic bags? ðŸ˜‚ Heâ€™s such a weirdo. If plastic has to be in the house it is under lock and key! Interesting about the cantaloupe. Iâ€™ll check that out! Thanks!"
aww,fd28epv,t1_fd1lpe1,1578143324.0,We have to hide cantaloupe from one of our cats. We have to put him outside so we can cut one up. We keep a printout on our fridge of things that are dangerous for pets because he is such a weirdo about fruit!
dementia,fcn0sce,t3_ei2mpl,1577799930.0,Both of my parents have dementia. My Mom enjoys puzzles and my Dad enjoys word searches. Maybe puzzles with fewer and larger pieces or large print word search books? It is tough to find activities that are challenging enough but not frustrating. I also play Doodle Dice with my Dad and it makes him laugh. Not sure if youâ€™re familiar with it? The dice have different symbols/shapes. You draw a card and roll the dice to try and make that picture. We bend the rules as Dad is pretty far along so we only make the doodles for cards with three or less dice. Iâ€™m not sure I explained that well. I hope this helps!
cats,fc5op8e,t3_eg9eht,1577462766.0,"What a beauty!!!
I have a kitty that was found the same way. She was my parentsâ€™ cat and when she was a kitten she would stop in the middle of playing like crazy and run up on your chest and lick your face. It felt like she was checking to see if someone was still there and still loved her. My parents both have dementia now so I took her in. She is nine now. She sleeps in my arms and I swear she chooses that over going to the bathroom or getting fed. She licks my face and sheâ€™s so awkward. If I cover my face she paws the blanket to get closer. I love little Wendy so much!"
