TheWayWeWere,fdytqi6,t1_fdxkkyj,1578783458.0,">It really hurt financially to leave for many years and learn up a new trade, but he did well. Few ever make that leap.

I feel bad for the families suffering because of all of this, but not as much for the actual people who had plenty of warning and didn't take the initiative to seek out alternative job options. Planning your whole life around, and relying on one company in your town to not move away or go out of business is just stupid. If I worked at a store and it's other locations kept shutting down,  I'd be expecting to need a new job at some point in the future.

I know it's probably not as easy as I make it out to be. I'm just sick of hearing about this handful of people who are apparently allergic to leaving their town and doing something other than mining."
