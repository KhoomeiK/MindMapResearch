SuicideWatch,fel5yoy,t1_fek04pf,1579214773.0,"Same here. It was the closest thing to that feeling for me, sort of gave me a reason to hold on and rethink my decisions."
SuicideWatch,fek270a,t1_fejhtls,1579191027.0,Like how tf are they so sure that itâ€™s just a permanent problem?? Yall dont even know me lol
SuicideWatch,feigr3a,t1_feib6f5,1579138155.0,"I honestly don't know. I can't see myself being happy with anything. I can be making six figures and still want to die. Being with my ex was the closest thing to living a life worth living for me but even then I still felt like killing myself. I don't really fall for people so if anyone's going to make a romance-related suggestion it's not going to happen, I'm sorry for sounding so stubborn but I've decided to stay single for the rest of my life, romance is overrated and it's just not worth it for me. 

I feel like a lot of things would have to change from the start for that to happen."
SuicideWatch,fei3zp9,t3_ep9vhw,1579129777.0,"to the user who deleted their comment: I don't expect things to be sunshine and rainbows all the time, but its really just not worth it anymore for me. I don't really get the difference between those two things, its just a way to rephrase things for me. How can you have the motivation to live if you're not living to be happy? How can you when you're not looking forward to that possibility of you being happy again? Why do you hang on to your life when you don't find any joy in it? How can you find joy in being alive when you have nothing left? I'm sorry this is just how i see it."
SuicideWatch,fei2wbq,t3_ep62lw,1579129089.0,"I feel that. I always feel like I have to ""clean things up"" before I go. Make things less traumatic, they don't have to know about all my ramblings and secrets. I want to help my family reach a financially stable situation before I die and meet my loved ones for one last time before I leave. I want to show up incredibly well dressed and successful, I want to make them happy and proud of me before I go, let them know that I've gave all those years my all and that I've had a somewhat ""fulfilling"" life (at least from the looks of it). Ultimately I just want a painless suicide. No matter how fulfilling things are I'll never be happy and those thoughts will always come back."
SuicideWatch,fei255j,t3_ep6c47,1579128623.0,I feel the same way about old friends. People drift apart so fast.
BreakUps,fei0mak,t1_feg0m4t,1579127698.0,I feel like at this point relationships are just not worth it. Romance is fucking overrated.
BreakUps,fefpjbj,t1_fefkwwi,1579061594.0,Don't know why I've shared that but it makes me feel better when I talk to someone. If you want someone to talk to I'm always here btw.
BreakUps,fefpgjx,t1_fefkwwi,1579061539.0,"I hope things will get better for you. I'm planning to give my life one last push, if that makes sense. Try as hard as I can to live a somewhat fulfilling or successful life on my own, then make the exit knowing that I've pretty much experienced most of the ""wonders"" life has to offer. Plus I want to help my parents out first, become financially stable, stuff like that. I've lost basically every single reason to stay and remain here in this world till old age. Never wanted to stay from the start but my ex sort of held me back from actually committing to it."
FrugalFemaleFashion,fdyzevs,t1_fdq9tpy,1578785139.0,Thank you!
FrugalFemaleFashion,fdjd84g,t3_ekwid7,1578466024.0,I'm trying to find good high-waisted shorts! Any suggestions?
SuicideWatch,fcmbs03,t3_ehsio5,1577769830.0,I used to but I don't think I can wait till then. Since finance is the biggest issue right now I'll make sure to take care of that for them before I die. I also don't wanna see them die. Yeah call me selfish I don't care. There's really no point for me to be here any longer past 45-50. Never asked to be born.
SuicideWatch,fc4m897,t3_eg359h,1577420837.0,"All the time, at this point it is pretty much reflex"
SuicideWatch,fbx751r,t3_eewe30,1577172315.0,"That's exactly how I feel with my ex bf sometimes. He tells me that none of it is my fault but idk I can't help but feel like I fucked up. I think I did. I didn't think about settling down getting married and having kids before I met him and I know it sounds dramatic considering how he's only my first ""real"" relationship but I love him so much. I think I fucked it up idk. Wish I could just end it all honestly but I have people to take care of. Planning to die in my 40s. And to be honest I don't believe in ""the one"" , I believe in making things work, if that makes sense.  When people tell me that I'm going to find ""somebody better"" it just upsets me because 1. I'm like borderline aromantic or something, I don't know, it's just really difficult for me to fall for people 2. I'm not going to disregard what we've had like that. 3. A part of me does not believe in the concept of romance, I think that it's just a mix of infatuation, lust, and friendship. People rely way too much on ""romantic feelings"" and I honestly think that it's just bs. That's infatuation and it doesn't last."
