college,ffrszyb,t3_eutcv7,1580165159.0,"the procrastination i did in high school worked with assignments and tests, and i did fairly well and graduated with a 3.5. in college, the assignments are a lot easier to procrastinate on and do well on than studying last minute and doing well, at least in my experience. i can write a 10 page paper in 2 nights and get a low A, but in a difficult class if i only give myself 2 nights to study, i’m fucked."

Shitty_Car_Mods,fdql9zy,t1_fdq2nd8,1578669384.0,the car in the post is too far but if you like anime and want to put on or 2 tasteful peeker decals there’s nothing wrong with it. i drive a black mustang and on the left rear window i have a sasuke peeker and don’t get any shit for it and it goes with the car. as long as it’s not over the top it’s fine

Mustang,fcvd0i4,t1_fcv12j3,1577999529.0,"i’d like to answer this as a mature person unlike the other guy :) so the reason i went with the ecoboost wasn’t due to the price, gas mileage, etc. that a lot of people give when asked this question. in all honesty, i really was never a muscle car guy at all and wasn’t in to mustangs... until the s550. the s550 is in my top 3 favorite car designs of all time. that being said, i’ve always been a fan of smaller engines that use forced induction rather than big ones that are NA. it’s just that i love how boosted engines feel. and of course i would prefer a twin turbo/supercharged gt over anything, but that’s not really in my budget. hope that makes sense :)

tldr; it just comes down to the fact that i’ve always been a jdm tuner car guy but the s550 is fucking gorgeous and the ecoboost gives me the car “feel” i’m used to while also giving me one of my favorite designs."
