Edit - Also curious as to whether the necessary score increases each year, or perhaps after each win."

boardgames,fe7j4er,t3_eo2mph,1578915258.0,"I got my dad Colt Express for Christmas. It’s awesome - doesn’t use a board at all, instead you build a 3D train whose carriage order changes each time you play, and the players move around inside the train and run along the top. I appreciate the big box with compartments to put all the constructed carriages! Super immersive “board” and the game itself is great fun too."
Pixar,fdro0vo,t3_emuxgd,1578687246.0,"The blue umbrella has been my favourite ever since seeing MU in theatre - the animation is some of the best I’ve ever seen, and totally shocked me at the time."
NonBinary,fdjnlnh,t1_fdixna7,1578479641.0,"Reminder that there isn’t a way to “present as non-binary”. People equate it with presenting androgynously, but the two are different things. No matter how you look or how people perceive you, if you are non-binary then however you present is, therefore, non-binary too. It’s sad that we still feel pressure to conform to something even after escaping our binary identities. You’re just as non-binary as somebody who is totally androgynous, you do you!"

bulletjournal,fc6n037,t1_fc6ltdf,1577484436.0,Hand drawn! Took way too long but I love how it looks
bulletjournal,fc02us7,t1_fbzknkv,1577275804.0,Continuing the current one - I’m a student so I started a new one in August 😊
bulletjournal,fc02tpo,t1_fbzbdqe,1577275758.0,"Thank you! It took about 4 hours spread over 2 days, definitely the longest I’ve ever spent on one spread!"
ftm,fbyz044,t3_ef1vx0,1577230219.0,I used to wipe my game every couple weeks to start over with a new character and pray for the day we could have multiple saves so I could change my mind every day and not screw up my progress.
