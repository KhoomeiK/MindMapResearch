 I just worry that the press will attack any gov that might question the oligarchy the UK is threatening to become, and their attacks matter because people sincerely believed Ed Milliband and Corbyn were ""unelectable"" based on what was printed.

I write down a moment I know is not right (eating is just turning food to paste until i swallow and it's so dull I'd rather just stop, I dropped the milk and considered suicide for my idiocy) and I focus on how I felt *then*.

These issues are solvable. They arent cryptic mysteries.
