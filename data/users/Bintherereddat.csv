>If people were listening to his music with a clean slate do you really think albums like Revival would hit #1 on the charts. 

I think his Stans (particularly ones who don't otherwise listen to hip hop) are the ones who drive his sales. His projects can be good, bad, a surprise and he will sell (and go number 1 apparently).

> I think it's the Stans that have the warped view not the ""haters""

I didn't understand this

> Which is another thing, how is calling his new music not good being a hater? 

"" I haven't found really anything he put out since like Eminem Show as truly good. Encore would have been good if he cut it down to like 8 songs as just like an EP or something but definitely after that his music has been serviceable at best...Eminem's recent shit is like the stuff you'd see praised on music by people who call rap is crap. The same type who think rap died after the 90's, or only listen to like Eminem and Kendrick""

You said this before I said he has passionate haters, which he does

>he's one of my most listened to artist of all time so why would I just randomly say fuck it Im going to pretend all his music is trash now. There isn't some conspiracy, a lot of people say his music has been bad for a while now definitely find it bad. 99.99% Of Hip Hop fans love Em's good music, there's absolutely no incentive to just start hating his music...unless of course it just really isn't good.

The haters imo are the ones who go into these albums expecting early stuff (ie some of the best hip hop work ever), and complain after a cursory listen or not listening at all.

> Like you are really tryna tell me his last like 5 albums have all just happened to be masterpieces and earned the #1 spots and acclaim because they were just that much better than everything else...nah I don't believe it, I mean come on use some objectivity. As Eminem himself has said if he was black he woulda sold half, he definitely get's a boost from his mainstream status.

Personally I hardly listened to MMLP2 and Revival, I gave them a shot and moved on....His projects can be good, bad, a surprise and he will sell (and go number 1 apparently). I'm spinning Circles much more than MTBMB. I don't think Taylor Swifts albums are better than everything else when she goes number 1 either.

>I'm no huge Tyler The Creator fan but he's right, anyone actually with artistic integrity or plugged into the rap scene knows Em's best days have long passed, and once again he's always been a huge Em fan but nah criticism now means you're a harter.

Not sure who you are arguing with or what your point was here so I didn't reply. I am a big fan of Tyler (one of the brighter musical minds in hiphop) and he said this after revival dropped.  

> Also way to use gatekeeping as a way to dodge critique

My first impression was that you were one of those ex Stans who wrote him off long ago because he wasn't recreating his old magic and have been extra critical of music you've barely listened to since the Eminem show.  My buddy is one of these people.  

I am a huge kanye fan, but not any new stuff (outside of the gospel). I give all his albums 2x listens and I don't spend time critiquing everything I disliked about his stuff on threads celebrating his success.  Eminem has a ton of these ""fans""

Your opinion does feel a few years dated to me, but Ill trust its not and you suck at analyzing music.

> It's weird how little self awareness you have. You are talking about haters and not judging stuff on their own merit then are quick to basically try personally attack my credibility or good faith in an argument rather than anything I actually said.

Umm.  I addressed every line that I understood.  Let me know if you need clarification."
Music,ffvfp77,t1_ffv8kn1,1580263038.0,"I'm not fully sure which part you are addressing but let me clear my point up a little. 

Eminem is massive.  I think his Stans (particularly ones who don't otherwise listen to hip hop) are the ones who drive his sales.  His projects can be good, bad, a surprise and he will sell (and go number 1 apparently).  I'm spinning Circles much more than MTBMB.  I don't think Taylor Swifts albums are better than everything else when she goes number 1 either.  I wasn't saying anything about the quality of his recent albums except Kamikaze and MTBMB.  Personally I hardly listened to MMLP2 and Revival, I gave them a shot and moved on. 

The haters imo are the ones who go into these albums expecting early stuff (ie some of the best hip hop work ever), and complain after a cursory listen or not listening at all.  That's why I asked whether you listened to the new projects and whether you are a hip hop fan - in my experience most hip hope fans acknowledge he has been evolving/expanding his comfort zone on his last two projects, after having declined for a while.  I trust that you don't like Marshall but you aren't unique, you are parroting the same criticism people have for years (almost verbatim).  My apologies for jumping to conclusions, Eminem is not for everyone."
Music,ffuy3em,t1_ffum9cq,1580251546.0,"Dude we have a very different experience on hiphopheads, checking those impressions threads will let you know what people are saying about the albums rather than having to make assumptions.  I mostly agree with your take on Kamikaze but I still enjoyed it and enjoyed MTBMB much more.   Of course he has a ton of fans (that's why he can drop bad albums or albums with no promo that go #1).  The haters I am referring to are people like yourself who listen to his music through this 90s lens, comparing before and after rather than just listening with a clean slate. There is lots of popular trash out there, you probably like some artists today that you would call trash had they had dropped the slim shady LP 20 years ago.

Why should my opinion be based on the fact that you think Dumba is comparable to Nylander? You think Bouchard + a pick to Minnesota means that Bouchard is worth less than Dumba, and Dumba = Nylander so why would they do that?
