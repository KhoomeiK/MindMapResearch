AskReddit,ff4zjuu,t3_erhu3x,1579576253.0,"I have this dream since I was a child in which I am being chased through a neighborhood next to mine that in real life has these pizza shape streets (a lot of diagonals streets). I'm always running but there is something odd with my legs because it's like I'm running through mud or something that slow me and if I see my legs there's nothing wrong, I'm just running like in slow motion but just for me because time for everything else it's the same, and I remember the anxiety of knowing that whatever it's chasing me it's getting close but I can't run faster. 

The thing that chases me it always changes, when I was little I used to be so scared to things like zombies, or bigfoot, or even the broccolies on the powerpuff girls haha, and those were the things that chased me, now I know they are mostly people that I don't know. 

 I always wake up before they grab me and I want the dream to continue to see if I can fight them or what happens with me afterwards, I know it sounds weird to wanting something like this to continue but I want to know why they are chasing me."
astrology,ff383nx,t1_ff2syi1,1579535926.0,">happened the same to me, I felt anxious all day but in another level at nights. Also today I'm feeling way better, I didn't wanted to get up out of bed because I was so amazed at how good I could sleep, finally."

AskReddit,fdmiiu7,t3_em2vfz,1578551139.0,"I learned to be pretty quiet because we lived with an schizophrenic uncle and sometimes the noise just made him so mad, nobody explained that to me so I just thought that that was the rule when you were inside. I got so used to that that I thought families were that quiet. I remember a friend once hanging out at my house and I thought she was being rude for talking ""aloud"""

depression,fdlx77w,t3_elycos,1578534650.0,"Oh it set me back and it frustrates me a lot! When I was not depressed I was the best of my classes at university, I did my hobbies, mantained a relationship, hanged out with friends, did voluntary work at an NGO... all I wanted to do was possible and I got it. Now? Well now I don't have a job and sometimes I just don't want to wake up nor go outside, and off course I don't want to talk with anyone. So yeah, I get what you say."
depression,fdlmw59,t3_elwq1m,1578527635.0,"I´ll buy but only if you're commited to make quality clothes, fast fashion would make your bussiness go into oblivion because that's not what new consumers are wanting anymore and because that's not what the planet needs. You can focus on create some few quality pieces that maybe also can have in them references to your cause which is mental health, maybe a small logo or a detail that you can associate with the cause. You can be recognized as a brand later by those few but quality items and by your cause."

I know there are others who have more stars in that skill but Veli also has a star in politics and a star in research so it's good if you want to focus on one  vizier's talent. Certainly helps with arena too."
AskReddit,fc4pirg,t3_eg6nio,1577423821.0,"In my case it helped me to differenciate my sadness to my depression, we all can be sad and that's ok but when you know you're depressed you can start to handle it better if you recognize it; in my case I know I'm depressed if I lose all motivation (I'm usually a pretty optimistic, idealist and goal oriented person even if I am being melancholic). I have had for many years depression, and I have been on medication and I've been even hospitalized for it, so I already know which are the things that are red flags for me, when I see one I try to do these things (even if are little) for coping with it, like making sure I am eating, going outside, finding spaces to take time for myself, and obviously look for help.  

I don't think I'm cured so I don't think I beated but I can handle it way better than before, sometimes I still have really dark moments though, but it's not as terrible as it was before."

AskReddit,fc299ci,t1_fbr3zkl,1577346647.0,"Then it's never going to be a fit time to dwell, if you look at it like that. I had a breakup when I was studying too and I tried to do the same as you and focus only on my studies, I did terrible on those, at the end I wasn't dwelling nor I was focusing.

If you need time to cry and feel like sh*t then find the space, do the things you like, talk with your friends about your ex whatever helps you cope, just find the space."
