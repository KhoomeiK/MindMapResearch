keto,fff6h8x,t3_et17yz,1579876936.0,This has inspired me to give it another shot after sort of giving up a couple weeks ago. Thank you and congratulations !
witchcraft,fff0yfz,t1_ffe6v0z,1579872658.0,"Why so ? Someone calling themselves a ""baby witch"" still deserves the help (or etc) they are potentially seeking in a post. Ignoring anyone who calls themselves a ""baby witch"" simply because *you* don't like the term doesn't seem very nice. I personally don't mind the term at all, I actually dislike ""newbie"" more but I would never ignore posts that use it just because I personally don't like it.

Forgive me, not trying to stir the cauldron or anything, just found it odd that a word would prevent you from reading a potentially good post or helping a new witch out."
