CanadianMOMs,ffx6gob,t1_ffut4zi,1580318754.0,Mota is either under dosed or WAY over dosed. I've had both sides of the Mota products. Fking idiots over there imo
CanadianMOMs,ffx6aar,t1_ffuj0t3,1580318647.0,"Lmao, this happened to me as well. I thought I could take as much as I wanted as I'd had a couple 400 mg choc bars that didnt do much for me at all. Then I got a 250 mg cookie from bcbudstore and I thought I was gonna die. Lol, my tolerance is pretty high but that day I found out that I def did have a limit to how much edibles I can consume. Goes to show how rare it is to get properly dosed edibles. I just use distillate now and take about 125-150 mg and I'm real good."
CanadianMOMs,ffqjn3w,t3_euk8xr,1580136421.0,I haven't ordered from them in a while but I was always very impressed with their flower. Especially their Purple Space Cookies. It's the best and most flavorful PSC I've ever had. I think I may have to place an order with them soon...lol

MOMpics,ffj1fmx,t1_ffirwku,1579987979.0,"It's one of the highest priced places tho. But, they have always had some of the rarer strains that look fking phenomenal. I've never pulled the trigger there either tho. Need some sort of windfall to go through with an order with them."
CanadianMOMs,ffj19qj,t3_esz1ru,1579987860.0,"I know that when you get a real quality edible and the right dose for you, you WILL know when you're high. Make sure you eat something fatty like cheese before you ingest edibles. They need something to attach to to release properly. THC takes a long time to uptake into our systems iirc so if you take them on an empty stomach, they'll pass through without fully releasing their dose. I may be wrong but edibles always work for me if they are properly dosed. I like about 150-200 mg to get me fkd up and sleeping like the dead...lol"
CanadianMOMs,ffizljf,t1_ffdptc4,1579986642.0,"Yes, the safest way is to research the IG moms here, I know I have and found a few really great places from reading multiple reviews and seeing pics and then reaching out to them for a menu. The only other ""safe"" way to try a new place is through word of mouth from good friends imo."
CanadianMOMs,ffiy8se,t1_ffhc2u2,1579985661.0,Gas Garden has some that's apparently got an absolute strawberry nose and nice potency. I've had this strain a couple times. The best version being from Kootenay Craft. It had a beautiful strawberry scent and was the perfect strain for golfing I found. I REALLY enjoyed Straw Jer.
CanadianMOMs,ffiy0so,t1_ffecmdr,1579985501.0,What a great strain that is. Just the PERFECT high for really any time of the day. Fantastic stuff!!
CanadianMOMs,ffixxd1,t1_fffkdlm,1579985431.0,"I'm feelin this comment all too much my man. This is exactly what I've gone through over the last 3 years. I did stick with HSP for quite a while there but I'm back to searching those sick pics, reviews and good prices! I just placed an order with LPB so we'll see how that goes. Walter opened a new shop over at buybcbud that I ordered from recently. REALLY good prices on concentrates (like 50 for 2 gs of the house brand amber shatter or 2 gs of terp sauce, both are great!) and hes always got some bomb flower going on within his selection. I got some of the wheelchair and I'm loving it, although I just found a mature seed in it. Still nice, potent indica and I'll give that seed to my buddy that grows. Fk I Love shopping for weed online."
CanadianMOMs,ffijl0u,t1_ffienzc,1579975411.0,I've noticed their scale fees are some of the highest I've ever seen. 220 an oz but 80 a q. I hate to see that. It def makes you feel shitty if you dont get the full oz.
Waxpen,ffido6f,t3_etm2ep,1579971392.0,"Get a dtv4 for the pico. I use this setup and I cant say enough how much I love this device! Get the TI buckets for it tho, they are so much easier to use than the quartz (just easier and quicker to achieve nice big clouds) for those that dont have a lot of experience. You just have to always give the v4 a 10 sec heat up then give it a hit. You cant go wrong with this attachment imo"
CanadianMOMs,ffic7oi,t1_ffi78r5,1579970403.0,"Lol, this place is unreal, you literally provided exactly what OP was looking for. I was looking at the wedding cake there yesterday (it looks amazing) but I went with the Tyson. I am already feeling regret...lol"

CanadianMOMs,ffiawzv,t1_ffdkatn,1579969513.0,"Exactly, the seal certainly helps keep everything fresh, Especially when they put a bovada in with it, but the preservation of the bud structure and trichomes is really the biggest advantage to these containers imo. I end up putting all my flower into mason jars with bovadas or Integras as soon as I get it anyway."

Waxpen,ffd8mpx,t1_ffd6abg,1579815562.0,I find if I leave the cap off for my 10 sec pre heat I can get one or two extra hits with a cool mouthpiece. I notice a very small amount of vapour coming off but nothing I would worry about

Waxpen,ff6cub5,t1_ff68tlq,1579624414.0,"You nailed it. It simply outperforms the sai in pretty much every way. Better clouds, easier to clean, more consistent performance. The only thing better about the sai imo is the mouthpiece is glass and doesn't get too hot like the v4 does. I also highly recommend the v4 over the sai"
Waxpen,feo3e1i,t1_fen6cy1,1579294602.0,I definitely let it get to temp. I fire it for at least 10 seconds and that usually brings it right up to temp then refire and pull and I get massive clouds
Waxpen,feo33m0,t1_fen9chb,1579294507.0,It would be the heating disk that heats the bucket. If you way over do the wattage these will break. At 60w I think this may be what's happened.
MOMpics,fennfa6,t1_feneqzl,1579288173.0,And you sir are doing some world class trolling...lmao
Waxpen,fen3qn5,t3_eprml1,1579276305.0,You may have blown the coil due to such high wattage?
Waxpen,fen32le,t1_femvbtr,1579275881.0,If you're using a dtv4 I use almost the exact same settings (I go 390f is the only difference) and mine will get it ALL with 6 or 7 hits. It keeps going until the bucket is dry. This is one of the reasons I MUCH prefer the v4 to the sai taf ti bucket as well as the consistency in clouds and density of vapor from the v4. The sai always leaves far too much reclaim imo.
Waxpen,fen2ian,t3_eq005c,1579275519.0,"Bump your watts up to 30-33w and see if that helps. 25 seems too low for the sai. I dont use the quartz coils, I have a ti bucket and it works quite well at 33w. Not sure how much different the quartz coils are for how much power they need but if you're not getting enough vapor, the first fix is to try bumping up the watts a little at a time."

Waxpen,fea4obg,t1_fe9vw53,1578944339.0,That was really informative. I have a dtv4 and I like my settings but I think I've got a lil tweaking to do based on your info. Cheers!

MOMpics,fe615fp,t1_fe4evwk,1578879461.0,So their flower comes in at 59%? That's about perfect imo. To each their own tho

Waxpen,fdzapuu,t1_fdyzu38,1578788264.0,"I find the Sai is inconsistent for clouds in the most confusing way. I gave up on it when I first got it but picked it back up one day and boom, MASSIVE rip, pretty much put me on my knees in a coughing fit so although it's not exactly reliable for good hits, the potential is definitely there. Sometimes I'll load up a large dab in a clean bucket and no clouds, just pools up. Then the next bowl will be massive clouds, bucket basically clean...at the same battery strength so performance isn't based on a low battery for me. My setting are always locked into 33w  420 .68 ohms and its hit and miss to say the least. I just use the dtv4 I picked up and its way more consistent. You can count on it to give you some big rips! If you have the means I HIGHLY suggest getting one and maybe a buddy of yours will take the sai off your hands."

There is no reasoning with people that have mental issues (such as bi polar disorder which is what I live with) at times and that can be very difficult. Proper medication goes a long way in helping with these issues and I thank god that my wife finally talked to her doctor after me GENTLY bringing it to her attention that there was a problem.

Waxpen,fdiab1r,t1_fdhommi,1578438579.0,The pin underneath holds the heater donut and spacer on the bucket. Try taking your v4 apart completely at some point to familiarize yourself with all the components and to learn how to rebuild it in case you drop it and break the spacer or something like I did. It's really not too difficult and definitely good to know how to do. I was able to seemingly get rid of some of the wobble in the bucket by taking it apart and putting it back together again. Good times!
