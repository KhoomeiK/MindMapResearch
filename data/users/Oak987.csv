At the time, the Commodore hotel was a failed hotel where prostitution and drugs took place right in the middle of the city. Trump wanted to buy the hotel and renovate it. But he wanted a long term tax incentive. 

Owning a hotel is a huge business risk. (As we know from Trumps failed casino ventures), so asking the government for a tax break in exchange for renovating a property that is falling apart, is a source of crime and is not generating any taxes anyways is a good deal for everyone."

But seriously. Water softener is a must in areas with hard water. Otherwise the minerals will clog up your water heater and reduce the efficiency and life expectancy. Just for comparison, call around to see how much your local guys charge for tankless heater de scaling. My guess is it will cost about as much as a new softener."

books,ff3ik2b,t1_ff3d4ho,1579541793.0,"Nothing *needs* to change. Books are a form of technology for storing and delivering information. As we develop more efficient methods, books will be replaced. There will still be a place for them. Kind of like vinyl records still exist, but for a special market of audio enthusiasts.

Edit: some of you think I mean ebooks. I don't.

Example: I used to own a Chilton's book for every car I owned. I don't for my current one. Every single fix I needed to do, I learned from you tube.

I used to buy several books every time I needed to upgrade my work skills. Not any more. I am currently subscribed to an e-learning course and love it. Just about to sign up for level 2 and will do level 3 after.
