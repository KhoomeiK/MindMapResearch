movies,ff2c2fe,t1_ff12wii,1579500243.0,I feel like by the time you made this thread and asked a bunch of anonymous assholes for their stupid opinions you could’ve been well into the first sequel.
movies,fezw7x7,t1_fezupxo,1579462459.0,I’m just not sure that’s accurate. Your assertion that “nobody” does is pretty presumptuous.
movies,fezt1tk,t1_fezfvx4,1579461284.0,"Did it? I mean, it’s not being discussed daily, but I’m not sure anyone thinks it’s irrelevant."
movies,fezqbxq,t1_fewq827,1579460315.0,I found your use of the word “entertainment” chilling
todayilearned,feygqlb,t1_fey9nci,1579445307.0,"This wasn’t even that long ago. I mean, this was my primary use for Netflix until like 2014."
movies,fejoj9t,t3_epiyj4,1579181690.0,No I didn’t want his last film to be Star Trek but boy was I curious to see what that looked like...
movies,fe8686j,t3_eo33nc,1578922999.0,Sometimes the trailer is what makes you wanna see a movie though...
movies,fe5ttay,t1_fe3lxgh,1578874785.0,"Yeah I found the pacing, especially on the front end, to be very snappy without feeling rushed."

todayilearned,fdkcyss,t1_fdk025h,1578501251.0,And the good people of New Orleans love it.
movies,fdjxsgr,t1_fdjx5k5,1578490859.0,Or else!
movies,fdcebb6,t1_fd1iwv9,1578272801.0,It’s not unfair. If it’s put up on the screen then it’s going to be part of the conversation.
todayilearned,fcyxp9i,t3_ejhww1,1578089374.0,I wonder if this inspired the movie Martin?
movies,fcy0mmd,t3_ejh958,1578073091.0,"And I mean these directors are producers as well. Some are very hands on. Del Toro and Spielberg, for instance, tend to be very involved producers."

movies,fcibdoj,t1_fcgn312,1577660084.0,Universal is just a distributor on this
movies,fchd9u4,t1_fcfyeej,1577649446.0,I don’t think it’s that far removed. Days of Heaven is definitely full of trademark Malick flourishes. I think it’s more that he’s become overly indulgent in these choices.
MovieDetails,fc72qaj,t1_fbyinju,1577495962.0,You’re not a freak! It’s not as popular as I always thought it was but I’ve definitely known plenty of people who do this.
