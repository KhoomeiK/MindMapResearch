Your own mother is sexualizing you. This is gross.

You did nothing wrong. Your brother isnt checking you out.."

AmItheAsshole,ffedys2,t3_eszvls,1579844480.0,"I'd say YTA but not really in a harsh way. If I was told to cook for a vegan, I'd be stumped. I wouldnt even know what to cook, because I would also need to know more about what they like eating. And its an entirely different kind of cooking. 

Did you make the dressing? If you did, you couldve simply made 2 seperate batches. Take all the ingredients together minus the honey, and split it in half. Then figure out a sub for honey in the vegan batch. 

Or, you couldve bought a dressing that doesnt use honey."

weed,ffed709,t3_et1qm3,1579843736.0,"Why would you do that though

Just roll a fucking fat one before you go on lmao"
AnimalsBeingDerps,ffe65hb,t3_esyuhd,1579837726.0,"Anyone ever realize that these puppies are basically the same as a human baby?

They're clueless, innocent, curious and want to explore. Except, the puppy has 4 legs and full mobility.  

I feel like we'd see equal chaos if babies had full mobility.."
AmItheAsshole,ffe5y5j,t3_et09ar,1579837570.0,"NTA. You werent asking him to do anything complicated. You're literally just asking him to use different color markers that you even provided him with. It sounds like you made it fairly easy for him to accomodate your disability. 

I think the suspension is deserved. Its not the same as him being fired anyways. Hopefully he learns his lesson and doesnt do some petty shit like that again to another student."
ThriftStoreHauls,ffdkjh9,t3_et02gx,1579822827.0,"Those things look so damn cool. 

Ima start looking for one of these on FB marketplace and craigslist. Ive never bought one because they're ridiculously expensive.

EDIT: Cheapest one I saw was a $100 desk ring fan. The one you have people are still selling for at least $150 and up. That is an amazing steal."
blursedimages,ffdkbu4,t3_esut42,1579822699.0,"I get the feeling that this isnt that great for the charging port. 

The phone pulls down on the cable, and then it in turn is constantly pulling on the charger inside the port. Which eventually could lead to your port not working.

Even if this doesnt hurt the port, that cable for sure wont last long."
