oculus,ffgqdtp,t3_etegqw,1579912397.0,I had the same issue.  Rolling back fixed it.  Shame you have to use some scuffed hacky bullshit to do it instead of just clicking a button in the app to roll back to previous versions.
oculus,ffgq16z,t3_etexug,1579912144.0,"I deleted my facebook account and have no interest in any of this stuff.  If I want to be social in VR, I'll do it over Discord.  Piss off Facebook."
oculus,ffgpld0,t3_et84pe,1579911835.0,"It should all be options, making decisions for everybody just draws in the people you cater to while pushing others away.

I don't want to crouch physically, because doing that as I need to in my day to day life is not an issue, but doing it as often as I do in most games I play where crouching is part of the controls would just be painful.  I'm almost 40 years old and my knees aren't what they used to be.  So I wouldn't want to be forced to do it, just like you shouldn't be forced to not be able to.

Same goes for the whole teleportation vs smooth locomotion thing.  Teleporting around completely breaks immersion for me and actually bothers me physically after a while, because it's jarring.  Smooth locomotion does give me a bit of motion sickness if I haven't done it in a while, but taking breaks until I adjust to it makes that go away, and it's overall a much more enjoyable experience once the motion sickness is gone.   I refuse to play games that force me to teleport and don't give me the option of smooth locomotion because I find them impossible to enjoy.  And I can understand why others would refuse to play games that did not give them that option.

**What VR users really want is to be able to tailor the experience to their own preferences.** Not everyone has the same mobility, physical fitness, or space available to them to play in VR the same ways that others do.  Developers should be as accommodating as reasonably possible to as many people as they can."

I personally find it completely immersion breaking and can't enjoy games that limit you to it.  And like some others, the teleporting itself actually starts to physically bother me after a while, and I can't adjust to it the way I can to other VR sickness inducing motion."
facepalm,ffg9gmt,t1_fffzno8,1579901334.0,"Well, it's a bit more complicated than that, which was addressed in [the article](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-205049/Women-work-longer-hours-men.html).  Pay raises and bonuses for salaried executives, who are mostly men, outpaced increased earnings from an extra 4 hours a week for carer jobs which are largely filled by women.  Though I view that conclusion with the same skepticism as the rest of the article, since the article itself seems less interested in sober analysis of what the study found and what it means, and more interested in latching on to cherry picked data points and presenting them in a sensational manner."

But please, feel free to point me in the direction of these studies about how women end up in their jobs and men end up in theirs.  I'm sure they're all peer reviewed, accepted and cited many times by other social scientists, especially if they point out these massive glaring errors in what I say that you keep hinting at but seem unable to clearly state."
facepalm,ffg3pgo,t1_fffywem,1579897786.0,">There’s so many things wrong with what you just said, but I have to much to do to explain.

If you're unwilling to present any evidence to the contrary, then I'll have to assume that you're in the camp I was talking about where you disagree because it ""feels"" wrong or because you just don't like the answers that social science and statistical analysis have come up with.  It's not like anything I've said is remotely controversial among people who have actually taken the time to look into the issue.

I'm not denying that there are deeper reasons behind other statistics, but making vague implications about them without any type of statistics or data to work with isn't very helpful or informative.

Of course we can say that society places different expectations on men and women, so therefore men are more likely to take a job as, say, a prison guard while women are more likely to take a job working in a day care.  And I wouldn't necessarily disagree with that.  But that's not exactly quantifiable, is it?  And what studies have been done about just the kind of 'deeper reasons' I suspect you're hinting at have produced [paradoxical results.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719?journalCode=pssa)

It goes without saying that the job you have is not necessarily the same as the job you want.  That's true for men and women so I don't see how that's particularly relevant.  Plenty of guys working in shitty factory jobs or warehouse jobs that would much rather be doing just about anything else, but don't because either the opportunities aren't available or the pay isn't as good.   And I'm sure there are plenty of women working in offices who would rather be anywhere else than in a cubicle for 8 hours a day.  

That's not some deep insight, nor is it a rebuttal to anything I've presented.  Because even assuming that these ""deeper reasons"" are a factor, they're only one factor out of many other quantifiable factors.

Also, where do you live that people are 'given' jobs and don't have any choice in the matter?  People do have choice.  Circumstances dictate some things of course, where you live, what the economy is like, education, social connections, skills, etc etc.  But to act like people don't have any choice in the matter is frankly absurd, plenty of people have choice, and plenty of people settle for 'good enough' because it's safe.  Which is actually one of those personality differences I was talking about between men and women, since men are more likely to take risk while women are more risk averse, generally speaking.    Men are more likely to uproot their life and move somewhere else for a better job than women.  Etc etc etc.  Again, go read the studies, it's not like they're top secret.

None of what I said is just pulled out of thin air because it 'feels' right.  This is all backed up by statistical analysis and social science.

https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/public-policy/hr-public-policy-issues/Documents/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf

Feel free to do some googling for more studies and analysis if that isn't enough for you.

The gender ""pay gap"" is actually a gender ""earnings gap"" and it exists not because men and women aren't being paid the same wage for the same work, but because of all the reasons I listed, and more.   Certainly, societal attitudes, discrimination and other ""deeper reasons"" are a part of it.  But they're not *all of it* and you can't just ignore the mountains of evidence for the other stuff which accounts for *most of it*.   If you disagree with that, then either show me some actual evidence of where my summary is incorrect, or keep your baseless objections to yourself."
facepalm,fffw2dr,t1_fffg8y0,1579893057.0,"I don't want to say the pay gap is a myth, because it isn't, but the people who just look at the pay gap and think ""well that's 100% wrong and needs to change"" either don't really understand *why* it exists or are the types of people that desire equality of outcome and don't care about the negative implications. 

Put simply, it mostly has to do with career choices, personality differences, hours worked, and prioritizing career over family.  

Men work more dangerous and less desirable jobs, and they are compensated differently as a result.   There aren't many women willing to go work on an oil rig, or a fishing boat, or a container ship, or driving a truck cross country.   They exist, but they're rare.   There are plenty of men willing to do these jobs.

There are an abundance of men willing to put in 60 or 70 hour weeks in hyper-competitive fields to reach the peak of their professions, where they are lavishly compensated.   Women, not so much.  They exist, but there are just far less of them.  I would guess mostly because women *generally* want to have children, and working 70 hours a week for 10-15 years to make partner or end up with an executive title doesn't leave much time for raising kids.  And there is a biological time limit for women.  Men can father children at 50.  Women can't become mothers at 50 without medical intervention or adoption.

Men and women *generally* have different interests.  If you were to take a sample of all people interested in working with machines, the vast majority of them would be men.  If you were to take a sample of all people interested in counseling people, the vast majority of them would be women.   And the differences only become more pronounced the more egalitarian a society is. 

That doesn't mean that men can't be nurses or women can't be engineers, of course.  It just means that *generally speaking*, men and women have different interests.

Another big issue is that men tend to be more assertive than women, generally.  That doesn't mean that assertive women do not exist.  And I do think that women being assertive are more likely to be seen in a negative light than men being assertive, so that's an area where society could use a bit of work.  But generally speaking, men are more willing to go and ask for a raise and lay out why they deserve one.  Women are less likely to do this.

Overall it's a complex issue, certainly one that should be talked about and examined, but I don't think that articles like this that cherry pick statistics and ignore the wider context are very helpful for informed discussion."
KerbalSpaceProgram,fffqgu8,t1_fffn7us,1579889581.0,">Secondly. I understand the stock cooler argument, I use the stock cooler and it's been good, however some people are having issues with 3rd gen cooling so it's mostly just a suggestion.

Nobody is having issues with 3rd gen cooling if they get a case with good airflow like the one I suggested and aren't trying to overclock.  

>Heres why I chose 6 cores. KSP is almost strictly single core bound game. 1 craft per thread. Bigger craft require stronger single thread performance. Ryzen 5 3600 has better single core performance than the 3700x. Not by much but because the 3600 is cheaper it makes more sense.

The Ryzen 5 3600 does not have better single core performance than the 3700X.  I don't know where you heard that, but it's simply not true.  Maybe you're confusing 3700X with 3900X? 

As far as it being cheaper and making more sense, nobody buys a computer strictly for one game.  Even if that were the case, there are better options for raw single core performance for less money, by that standard.   I mean by that standard you could just say go and get an i3 9100F which is under $100 since the single core performance is comparable and the extra cores don't really matter, right?

Hell, if we're talking strictly KSP, then the 5700 XT is complete overkill.  Even with mods and running at 1440p, a video card that cost roughly half as much would be perfectly adequate.  Clearly we're talking about building a PC for more than KSP here.

I don't want to speculate on KSP 2, since I don't have any data to go on.  What I do know is that more than ever before, games are developed from the outset for both consoles and PCs.  And when we have spec sheets saying that both the PS5 and Xbox Series X are going to have 8 core 16 thread processors, and indications that they're both likely to arrive for the holiday season this year, buying a 6 core gaming PC in 2020 doesn't make much sense.  Especially when the difference in cost is so small.

>Now the motherboard you chose has poor power delivery and likely would hinder the performance of the 3700x.

It doesn't have *poor* power delivery.  There's a difference between ""poor"" and ""not best.""  The difference here is about $35, or 16GB of RAM vs 32GB of RAM.  The VRM on the Asrock B450M Pro 4 will not limit the performance of a 3700X.  It would likely limit a 3900X.  

Nor will the VRM on the $35 more expensive motherboard you chose enhance the performance of the 3700X.  Unless we're talking about overclocking.  And I'm not, because overclocking is no longer a way to pick up ""free"" performance, but a way to sucker dummies into spending extra money on voodoo like better load line calibration to stabilize their overclock.

The fact of the matter is that the 3700X is fine out of the box, and [isn't worth overclocking.](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/overclocking-amd-ryzen-7-3700x)  So there's no reason to spend extra money on ""better power delivery.""

>However it is important to keep the speed high and the timings low to improve performance of the infinity fabric. 3200-3600mhz is about the sweet spot for price-perfromamce.

Timings don't make *that* much of a difference unless you're spending big money on incredibly low timings for overclocking headroom, or you're the type of person that masturbates over synthetic benchmarks.  The only effective difference between the memory kit I chose and the memory kit you chose were that mine was twice as large with slightly looser CL16 timings. 

CL16vs15v14 is not worth paying more than $5 or so for as a consumer. The latency difference is only about 13%.  We're talking nanoseconds here.  In games it wouldn't even be measurable. 

I would challenge anyone to blind test two computers that were identical other than having C15 DDR4 3000 vs C16 DDR4 3000 memory and point out any appreciable difference.  The differences would show on a synthetic benchmark but nobody is going to sit down to play KSP and say *damn I wish I had splurged on CL15 memory*."
KerbalSpaceProgram,fffbf09,t1_ffe2h38,1579880253.0,"I really wouldn't recommend buying a 6 core or 16gb of ram anymore.

6 core is fine *now* but 8c/16t consoles are just around the corner and that's what many games will be optimizing for going forward.  RAM is so cheap that it just doesn't make sense to only get 16GB, especially for KSP which is literally the only game that I've ever crashed by running out of memory on a 16GB machine.

Also don't really see the point in buying a Hyper 212 when AMD processors come with a perfectly adequate cooler.  Unless you're getting something substantially better (the Hyper 212 isn't) that money would be better spent on more cores, more memory or a better PSU.

KerbalSpaceProgram,ffeu5a8,t3_eqwhvc,1579865644.0,"I use both.  KER for the info panels, because it's more customizable.  I like having mechjeb for the maneuver planner.  After playing this game for many years, doing *everything* manually and overshooting maneuver nodes because of a GC stutter while warping just gets tedious after a while.  Being able to create the maneuver node myself and then just press a button and let MechJeb warp to and execute the node perfectly is a big time saver.  O also feel that it's more realistic since astronauts aren't manually sitting there with a stopwatch waiting to throttle up and down for routine maneuvers.  Perhaps they were in the early days but that's already modeled by the progression in the mod, with automation unlocking as you reach certain milestones.

Things I dislike?  I wish the mechjeb menus fit in with the appearance of the stock game more.  Also some of the calculated maneuvers are so inefficient that they're pointless to use.   Like automated launches.   Which is a plus and a minus since really you should be able to do them yourself before just pressing a button to do it, but if I can do an efficient gravity turn that only requires under 50ms of dV to circularize, and the GravityTurn mod can do it, then why can't MechJeb?"

todayilearned,ff2lswk,t1_ff2fvqb,1579512235.0,"just keep in mind that quitting cigarettes is difficult, and that a lot of people you see smoking didn't start when packs cost 6-7 dollars.

When I started, I wasn't even a teenager yet, cigarettes could be bought out of a machine for a couple of quarters no questions asked.  I was a latchkey kid so when I wanted cigarettes I would just make myself a PBJ for lunch before school.  By the time my mother figured out that I was smoking I was a teenager and there was little she could really do to stop me from doing it.  She tried to force me to quit by cutting off money, grounding me and all of that stuff but I wore her down until she just accepted it.  It became a 'choose your battles' kind of thing.

25 years later I was spending a car payment on cigarettes every month.  It was a bitch and a half to quit.  I haven't had a cigarette in over 5 years and sometimes I still think about having one.

Warthunder,ferjm1o,t3_eqg3uf,1579354728.0,"Look for [this indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_and_slip_indicator) in your instrument panel.  It will help you trim your aircraft for straight and level flight.

I'm no expert so maybe someone else wants to chime in and correct me here, but typically what I do is once I take off, I climb out to about 1500m, level out to cruising speed. Then I start trimming the aircraft to counter-act any torque first.  The ball at the bottom of that indicator will move in the direction that you want to apply rudder trim.  So if it is to the left you apply negative, to the right you apply positive.  I usually apply a few percentage points of aileron trim first to start counteracting the torque, then refer to the slip indicator and adjust the rudder accordingly.  Sometimes you may need to go back and adjust the aileron and rudder until you find a good balance as adjusting one will throw the other out of whack.  I don't think I've ever encountered an aircraft that needed more than a few percentage points in any direction, maybe 10% at the most.

One thing to keep in mind, however, is that you are trimming the aircraft for straight and level flight.  What I've noticed is that in a climb I will then start to slip in one direction, and in a dive I will slip in the opposite.  Also, different speeds can make your trim less effective, even when flying straight and level, like after a dive if you're chasing someone.  If you're able to take your hand off the stick in straight and level flight at 400kph due to your trim settings, they're probably not going to work at 250kph, or 600kph.  

Some planes just cannot be trimmed out perfectly, for whatever reason.    On those you just do the best you can and have to deal with making adjustments on the stick.  I don't know if it is a problem with flight models or just inherent instability in the aircraft or what.  It's definitely annoying though.

Also, some planes do not have the ability to trim on every (or any) axis in an actual match, but can be trimmed in test flight.  In those cases you can use the button for trim fixation after you find good settings in test flight to hold those settings for every time you fly out the aircraft, but you will be unable to adjust them without going back into a test flight.   It's a good idea to go through your lineups for each EC bracket and trim out every one in test flight so that the settings are loaded each time you get in the plane, saves you having to do it every time."

Warthunder,fe2k8o8,t1_fe2jaey,1578839400.0,"Yeah, the lower tier machine guns can be harder to use than the mid tier cannons for that reason.  The earliest guns are pretty easy because the planes are so fragile, by 2.7ish the MGs start to struggle a little bit unless you've got good aim, but then you start getting into 6x.50 cals and cannons.  Some of the planes around that transition point struggle a bit, like the early cannon 109s you posted about.  The same thing happens when you get into jets, suddenly .50 cals become less effective and 30mm+ cannons become the new hotness, certain planes around that transition struggle too."
Warthunder,fe2gp61,t1_fe2dhbm,1578838146.0,"Arcade is best for grinding crew levels.  For SL, it's a wash between RB and AB, depends on your skill, the plane, and the team composition.  Kills are worth more in RB but if you're flying allies between 3.0-5.3 and getting roflstomped 9/10 rounds that doesn't matter much, and if you're flying axis and struggling to get kills because everyone else is getting there first the same applies.  I find that I earn more SL in arcade given the faster pace, I can get more kills and finish 2-3 rounds in the time in takes to finish one RB round.  Plus in RB, especially at higher tiers, the repair costs can become an issue.

For RP grinding, sim is the way to go.  A bit more time consuming until you get the hang of it but once you can get kills consistently, jumping into EC matches with 30m to an hour left and grabbing a couple of kills is a great way to earn some RP.  Especially if you use a premium plane, a talisman, and/or a premium account.   Aside from sim, RB is probably better if you can get kills consistently.

Honestly though, the best way to grind is to just not grind.   Play to have fun.  Try to enjoy the planes you have, learn to fly the ones that you have and are struggling in until you're not struggling in them as much.  It will make you a better pilot for later.  The truth of the matter is that the game doesn't get 'better' the further into the tree you go.  If you're focused on having fun and not worrying about trying to move on to the next unlock as soon as possible, you'll find planes that you enjoy, learn to perform well in them, and the RP/SL will accumulate.  

Given your questions, I'm guessing you're pretty new, so definitely slow down, don't try and rush your way out of the lower tiers."
Warthunder,fe2a24w,t3_eneoni,1578836114.0,"MG FFs are tricky in arcade, because the marker shows up way before the effective range of the gun, which lures you into firing well before you should.  Also if you're used to American .50s, going from death lasers that can melt people from 1.5km away to low velocity cannons that require you to be close enough to breathe your target's exhaust fumes is a big adjustment

What you want to do is close to ~400m before firing it.  I recommend having a separate button for just machine guns so you can spray down people from further away, though you'll want to use a belt with tracer rounds so you can actually aim them effectively since the aim marker is set for the cannon unless it's out of ammo.  

Problems with the gun disappear in RB or Sim where they're more effective as long as you're in range since the damage model is different, or once you get to MG151s (109 F4 and beyond) which have more than double the effective range.

Edit:  Also, don't uninstall the game just because you're struggling right now.  That's part of the process, and you will repeat it often, because all planes in this game have their own strengths and weaknesses, enemies they face that they do well against, and enemies that they don't.  You're going to eat shit for a while when you get into a new style of plane, or switch from one set of guns to another, or have to fly out a plane without upgrades against fully upgraded opponents.   Doubly so when you're just starting out in a plane and facing people in higher tiers who have tons of experience in theirs. Just try to relax and not get tilted over it.  And if you start getting frustrated, take a break, go fly some stuff you do well in.  You can always come back to it later when you're less frustrated."
