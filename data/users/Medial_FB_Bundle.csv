dataisbeautiful,fffvkjl,t1_fffr1cc,1579892743.0,Actually that sounds kinda good.
RoomPorn,ffdcoao,t1_ffda67m,1579818076.0,"See how close it is to the water, on ground level, and a very nice interior? I'm not saying it's impossible to pull that off in USA east coast, but if you think about it for a second you can see why it wouldn't be a good idea."
socialism,ffcxaqt,t1_ffc3f6g,1579809198.0,"As well as a lot of people having left the work force or people working part time, etc."
Justrolledintotheshop,ffcr5rd,t1_ffcpwq5,1579805549.0,Right? They're crazy expensive. Like a base model low end sedan will run 15k new if you can find a deal. A decent car or truck is 23-30k.
RoomPorn,ffcpm6s,t1_ffcgym7,1579804531.0,Yeah I feel like this photo is kinda obviously not any where in the US east coast.
worldnews,ffc4dq8,t1_ffc1ohe,1579791242.0,That's pretty expensive by American standards! That's like $14-$15 for a pound of unroasted beans. It better be fair trade! That's the price for some of the best locally roasted stuff I could buy.
worldnews,ffc1fe1,t1_ffbpgfo,1579789101.0,"Actually, you got a point. The big industrial operations are horrible for the environment and their slave wage employees."
worldnews,ffa896z,t1_ffa3r80,1579729808.0,"Re-using plastic bags and aluminum foil is a lot easier than people give credit for, though I assume a product that's marketed as re-usable would be robust enough to be sanitized. The only time I don't reuse my plastic bags is when they've been used to marinate raw meat. And heavy duty aluminum foil can be rinsed, dried and carefully folded."
worldnews,ffa7xx5,t1_ffa11sz,1579729632.0,"I know, coffee, chocolate, palm oil. All of the tropical goods that get shipped all around the world and are consumed in virtually every country on Earth. Climate change is going to fuck up the coffee, cacao, tea, palm, etc. growing regions first."
worldnews,ffa7bhr,t1_ffa5bs3,1579729284.0,"Firehall, is that the fire department station house?"
CatastrophicFailure,ffa6pa6,t1_ff9x045,1579728941.0,"Oh yeah, I don't think anyone would be letting kids run around in fire suppressor foam these days. But it might have been a nontoxic variety, who knows."
quityourbullshit,ff9bk3w,t1_ff8wf46,1579709217.0,Ain't nothing pseudoscientific about rapidly rising sea levels.
collapse,ff869kz,t1_ff7hbxe,1579667168.0,"I've been saying it for years, our society is profoundly fucked up. Some people never realize it, others learn to cope, others destroy themselves trying."

environment,ff775lv,t1_ff75b23,1579642453.0,"Right? I respond to a position and I'm asked to provide articles, but it's literally just my opinion based on the issues as I understand them. r/environment doesn't like nuclear, I get that, but the pressing issue is carbon, not radiation."
collapse,ff7106b,t1_ff6y7t2,1579638967.0,"The surveillance state wants to have the ability to identify everyone with or without their consent. DNA, fingerprints, gait analysis, surveillance cameras, surveillance drones (!). It's a matter of time before a drone is used to execute an American citizen in country."
collapse,ff70l70,t1_ff6x3a4,1579638721.0,You mean 110 degrees and dry as a bone all summer? There great plains are going to get pretty shitty in the not so distant future.
environment,ff6zyrn,t1_ff6xaco,1579638359.0,"None of that really matters when nuclear reactors can provide such a huge amount of energy in an easily regulable way for so long. It's not about price, or waste storage, it's about replacing carbon fuels. As it stands there's no way in hell we're ever going to be able to sustain our energy needs with renewables alone, at least not as quickly as we need.  And we need *more* energy, the population is growing, standards of living are rising, and besides fueling that growth we need an excess of carbon neutral energy so we can adequately sequester atmospheric carbon.

There are valid criticisms of nuclear but we're in crisis mode and we need to use every carbon neutral source in our energy mix. There's just no other way."
environment,ff6z2wv,t1_ff6oxpl,1579637841.0,"It's so ridiculous that he keeps running for president. There's no way in hell he could ever get elected, you'd think he would know that."
TopMindsOfReddit,ff6rpfw,t1_ff6oc5w,1579633482.0,At 100% tax rate it's basically just all communal property at that point. Which would be awesome if it could be made to work.
PoliticalHumor,ff6ppcu,t1_ff6fdd2,1579632289.0,"Wow, that is about the most disingenuous thing I've ever heard. The Republican party of the 50s was to the left of the current Democratic party! The current GOP shares nothing but a name with the GOP of old."
HistoryPorn,ff6ky16,t1_ff6ial1,1579629412.0,Truth really is stranger than fiction.
Awwducational,ff68fdo,t1_ff5y911,1579621582.0,"Actually, now that I think about it, trash might be a good way to build up port cities to protect them from sea level rise. Why bury the stuff in 200 foot tall hills when we could shore up our seaboards."

ProRevenge,ff4vuva,t1_ff4rytr,1579573679.0,"Dude, the pee tape is almost certainly real, Trump was set up by the Russians specifically so they could film him doing some fucked up shit. It's fucking KGB-101. Even if the pee tape isn't real, there's something equally as juicy out there."
