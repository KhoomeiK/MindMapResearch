BipolarReddit,ffcq33s,t1_ffcoumo,1579804840.0,"Depakote works on my mood, but after a year or so I seem to relapse for some reason.

I constantly gain weight from the get go. No craving, no change in appetite, I just gained 10kg in a year or so. Almost lost them in maybe 3 months of Topamax.

I would say Topamax *lowers* the mood a bit, or *averages* it out a bit. On the other hand, I may have made a mistake in stopping antidepressants at the same time as Depakote, so take my experience with a grain of salt. Now I'm back on track.

To be honest, I'm in awe at this medication's potential. I started it because I was in the same situation as you. Now, even after Christmas, new year, and some other time of binges, I expect a bump up on the scale, and somehow, I still manage to drop. Of course, there's still some regular workout and heavy sweating involved. It's not entirely free, but there is hope."

Sanda is already something of a hybrid style. It has kickboxing strikes, but no knees or elbows. It has grabs and throws, but no follow-up. In and of itself, it's already a lot, especially considering that the area is open.

If raised fast enough, chassés can be used to knock down any kicks, pretty much.

To answer your question, in my case, there's usually a point when I snap and the decision to cut is made. The action doesn't have to follow immediately, but once I'm set, I'll generally do it at my usually time later on. It takes an extraordinary event or medication to distract me from my goal."
martialarts,fdxwpxv,t3_enazgr,1578773707.0,"Heard about it. It's theoretically a blend of shaolin for long range, southern praying mantis for close range, and vovinam for the legs. Additionally there's some weapons forms with the cool but useless stuff (nunchaku) and the boring but practical (staff, spear...). Not sure about any sanda or other sport format, probably depends on the country, but going on a limb here, I'll assume it varies between schools.

The problem with the style and other lesser known styles is that they are not available in other places. I've only ever heard of QKD in one country, so were you to take up training, take rank, then move to another place, you'd have nowhere to train further.

It only really matters if you care about rank and all that stuff, or if the curriculum of the style makes it critical. Training in rare sparring heavy styles is no big deal since whatever you learn translates to other styles. The same can not be said about empty hand forms.

Now, if you're mostly a hobbyist, go there and have fun. If you find what you want in it, everything else is inconsequential. If you want to go further, you can still look into the parent arts."

To answer your question, reaching the grade of black belt means that one has learned the basics and can now move towards mastery. Or at least, that's the expected answer, to make it short.

To some, and for some styles, it's also the key to some stages of competition. It means that you're now technically mature enough to take part in certain event, and also that you may do your part as a referee or jury at some point.

Finally, and that's more personal, a black belt is one of the requirements to teach the art yourself. It kind of makes sense to prove your own mastery and technical knowledge before you're sent off to transmit it to your pupils. Granted, there is generally a pedagogical training in-between but still. There's knowing the skill and knowing how to teach it.
