relationship_advice,ff20w8t,t3_er75ys,1579490829.0,"I went through something similar in high school.  Although my friend didn't explicitly say she was going to cut herself, she gave obvious signs almost like a cry for help.  I was 15 at the time and didn't know how to handle it, so I just talked to my parents.  They talked to her parents for me and she got some counseling.  She was never mad, but it's not uncommon for her to be mad.  We did end up dating for a while after that.  We're in our late 20s now and I haven't talked to her in probably close to 10 years, but it seems like she's in a happy relationship and has a good life.

I think you should talk to your parents or her parents dorectly and tell them calmly what's on your mind.  If she IS already cutting, she needs to see someone.  If she's just using it as a threat to control you, then that's a pretty shitty thing to do to your significant other and you should re-evaluate your involvement with her.

Edit:  As hard as it can be to deal with that, hanging up on her is probably the wrong move.  I would recommend trying to have a calm talk about how you feel about her saying those things.  And again, if it doesn't improve after the talk, you might want to think about why you're going to be in a relationship with her.  Getting her help should be priority number one though."
