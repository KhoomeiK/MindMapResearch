Wellthatsucks,ffaq4lf,t1_ffan3ja,1579741870.0,"I think we beat them this year. Anecdotal but when I visited LA at least people let me change lanes when I used my blinker, here they just speed up to prevent you from changing or merging."
Wellthatsucks,ffafdas,t1_ffadeb7,1579734434.0,"Honestly it's primarily the native people between 21 and 50 that make up the majority of the assholes here. They feel so entitled to the road that they drive like lunatics causing accidents left and right. There's a reason Miami is voted worst city to commute, angriest drivers and worst drivers."

BeAmazed,ff81dkk,t1_ff7lxae,1579663439.0,"No you're right, it's all about leg placement. Sumo means you're starting with a really wide stance so your range of motion overall is much shorter than traditional Romanian deadlift. The hand placement is irrelevant because no one is going to pull outside of their legs during a heavy sumo DL."
BeAmazed,ff80csw,t1_ff7x2ki,1579662705.0,Only if you're pushing way too much weight than you're used to. When doing any sort of heavy compound lift like squats or deadlift you want to create a strong internal pressure against your abdominal to keep a stiff rigid core so you don't throw out your back. There's always a risk of injury but that's why you got to start slow and work your way up.
UpliftingNews,ff6zvfw,t1_ff6wwr6,1579638305.0,Depends how long you're at the range. I've done ok with just plugs if I'm spending less than an hour. Any more then I'll need big muffs but they get in the way of good practice aiming imo and then my ears start cramping. Silencers aren't even that quiet they just help muffle the sound slightly.
SandersForPresident,ff672ji,t1_ff618kl,1579620679.0,Like banks? Cause apparently they were just fine up until they realized no one could pay back their debts but then the American tax payers bailed them out anyway. If this issue isn't taking care now it WILL explode in 10-20 years and everyone our age looking to retire is going to face a huge crisis.
SandersForPresident,ff66wsn,t1_ff5rsq3,1579620575.0,Worked for the banks in 2008 just fine creating the strongest economic boom of the 21st century.
instantkarma,ff3fee9,t1_ff3edd0,1579539941.0,"I mean looking at the footage we see a number of things.

Dog is standing in the middle of the street.  
Driver begins swerving left possibly to get around him on the free side not expecting the dog to get up and turn around.  
Dog gets up immediately turns around in direction of bikes path.  
Dog does a 180 and goes the other way.  
Bike makes same manuveour almost simultaneously.   
Dog sees this and does another 180.  
Bike again turns almost immediately in the same direction upon which he loses control and goes into the fence.   


Either this guy has really great reflexes for running over small objects or it was just a panic situation. It's easy to see this from both sides but Reddit seems to always jump on the worst case scenario."
CompetitiveEDH,few3mma,t1_feur5hx,1579404876.0,I find it quite the opposite. Our pod has been 3-man for over a year now and most games come down to one player deciding the winner. It's usually Player A deciding to swing/lethal B or C leaving the other an opening to retaliate.
AskReddit,few2q5u,t1_few1jc1,1579404643.0,"I am so confused the, according to searches.

Déjà vu is the feeling of familiarity, that what's currently taking place has already happened.   
Déjà Rêvé is the feeling of already having been dreamed or feeling like your in that dream.   


I guess to me they sound functionally the same. I've never been able to differentiate between them."
AskReddit,few0hol,t1_fevxtrl,1579403722.0,"Pretty sure that's just regular Déjà vu. Essentially the events currently taking place feel like they already did at some point and as the events are taking place you feel like you can literally recall what's happening ahead of time. I've had it multiple times in my life. Usually an event is taking place but then I'll recall that I recalled that event a year ago, or maybe a week. Apparently it has something to do with a glitch in your brain processing a current event into a memory bank that makes you feel like it took place in the past, shit's wild."

rareinsults,fesxpyj,t1_fes1sqo,1579370001.0,"I do this during my commute and when they make eye contact I just slowly lift my coffee, take a sip and nod disappointingly. Then I immediately crank up the music. It infuriates people when they see you having a good time. Like bitch, we're both going to be in the same bumper to bumper traffic for the next 45 minutes, get over yourself."

EarthPorn,fes7zwd,t1_fes43nr,1579362338.0,"Been in the area and yeah it's nowhere near this bright but compared to being in a city, holy shit is it amazing. Nothing like kicking back on the back porch surrounded by the darkest of nights and smoking the fattest of doobs."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fes7c2c,t1_fes5wq5,1579362160.0,"Instagram stories don't have to be video's, you just need to have a picture or video to post them. He overheard the conversation then posted a picture with the overlaid text so he could put it on IG."

starterpacks,fepn5gi,t1_fepg0up,1579324964.0,"Same, especially when you start branching out and going to major tournies. Went to 1 or 2 Smash majors back in 2016(?) and holy hell. There were just pockets of noxious gas around some of those friendly setups. I understand fighting games are intense and sometimes build up a sweat but for the LOVE OF GOD SHOWER AND GET DEO! Also I saw many smash players sleeping/living out of their car. It's a pretty poor e-sport so a lot of these guys either share hotels or just sleep in the parking lots."
MapPorn,feplak8,t1_feoypk6,1579323485.0,Overrated stretch of road with white trash and overpriced alcohol.

HumansBeingBros,fep9aru,t1_fep64h5,1579315024.0,"True, you know a good prime rib from a bad one when it's available all day. Most decent restaurants usually offer it with a window like after 5PM or something because it's been slow roasting all day. Everything else is just pre-sliced and quickly seared which makes for a tough piece of meat."
wholesomebpt,feozrwn,t1_feop2qg,1579308948.0,Anyone who reads this and thinks that is probably already in the club.
wholesomebpt,feozf0z,t1_feoyddm,1579308719.0,Thus creating a vicious cycle. Sometime's it's nice just being nice.
HumansBeingBros,feougdo,t1_feoh6uh,1579305690.0,"That's weird, a well cooked slow roasted prime rib is usually incredibly tender and breaks apart rather easily. Maybe it's just so delicious they're inhaling their food."
ThatsInsane,fekp886,t1_fekm9fv,1579204752.0,Michael Jackson kinda did as a move but for no more than a second or two.

trashy,fei1zge,t1_fehgdlh,1579128527.0,Howard Stern is the perfect example. They get listeners and viewers specifically because they say controversial shit.
Miami,fehc4ac,t1_fe5v7rk,1579113510.0,As a privileged white man I don't understand why immigrants or people in poverty have such an issue with tackling capitalism or at least redistributing wealth. Many top ranking billionaires feel they should give more to society. The majority against increased taxes would be the ones that benefit the most from them. People seem to think it will create the next Castro or Maduro.
Miami,fehada2,t1_feetmn9,1579112466.0,To work and live in downtown you're spending an average of half your income or more on rent/association costs alone and I make a damn good salary. It's fucking bullshit. My best chance at reasonable proximity living is for my family to die off so I can inherit property as morbid as that is. This city is going the way of Jersey and NYC.
Miami,feha0im,t3_eopxfy,1579112252.0,Carnie cinnamon rolls is where it's at. But I am not paying $30 to walk into Santa's or the Youth Fair just to buy junk food. I'd rate Knaus as #2 because I can't seem to find store bought rolls that are anywhere near as good except maybe Cinnabon fresh.
SandersForPresident,feh1azp,t1_fegy2do,1579107061.0,That situation is very different from today. The DNC torched their own campaign by pushing a candidate that most were already on the fence about to begin with. The same started with Biden but that's slowly losing traction. We have a much better chance now than if we were to just smear everyone else with baseless accusations. Bernie has shown that he has the knowledge to refute them. He's grown much more as an aggressive candidate than last time.
pcgaming,fegmnqc,t3_eoisok,1579097374.0,Caesar was my childhood jam! Will definitely give this a shot when I get a chance.
dankmemes,fegl4kk,t1_fegepv2,1579096145.0,Doesn't help all the Reddit hosted images. Imgur took hits now and then but Reddits image host feels like it goes down a few times a day.
Wellthatsucks,fegkup4,t1_fegktcr,1579095900.0,Welcome to Reddit. Gotta squeeze the outrage juice where they can.
Wellthatsucks,fegkt45,t1_fegddf3,1579095857.0,Oh shit.. now I know why this would happen to me everytime I went to Disney.
Wellthatsucks,fegkkuv,t1_fegi1cq,1579095620.0,Nah regular pants even jeans look like skinnies on big calved people. Pain in the ass to put on and off. I tend to get boot cut or anything that doesn't taper at the leg but rather the thigh.
science,fef9l8d,t1_fef59h0,1579051412.0,"Same here friend, anecdotal but weed helped me lose 120lbs and get in the best shape of my life. It's like I can finally focus on something while blocking out the mundanity of life or my intrusive thoughts."
worldnews,fef7oji,t1_fef5w0q,1579050130.0,Would it be possible to get a statistic of how much the locals siphon vs the Chinese owner? Regardless I would expect locals to have the priority to harvest their own water supply vs an outsider who just so happened to be running a hotel on said area.
pcgaming,feegd9s,t1_feefjbh,1579033201.0,Valve knows this and Epic knows this. Their main goal is to establish a large enough user base that they can then sustain themselves organically. We'll see a slow down in how many new IP's Epic tries to scoop up for exclusivity once they reach that critical user count.
BlackPeopleTwitter,feb3elb,t1_fean8yt,1578955058.0,My friends group chat is 8 people and even that gets hectic. I can already imagine going through a day at work and coming back to 500+ unread messages.

pcgaming,fe9e5kg,t3_eo74b3,1578936746.0,"For those who do own the game, Xliveless.dll works great. Although you may need to downgrade and prevent updates but I been running it like this for 10 years."
pcgaming,fe8na0v,t1_fdxklmj,1578928215.0,I put in a Steam refund and wrote the 144 refresh rate as being one of the major reasons in my decision. Hopefully they take note.
ManufacturingPorn,fe8khq5,t1_fe7ddu7,1578927172.0,Yep much healthier to digest raw fats. All that pure rendered oil with butter flavor is not the greatest for us.
ManufacturingPorn,fe8jf3k,t1_fe898j6,1578926789.0,"Usually it's a product of repurposing opportunity. ""Hey we have all this left over oil from so and so, we'll sell it to you on the cheap."" ""Sure, hmm I wonder what I can do with all this cheap by-product."""

BokuNoHeroAcademia,fe3zdqh,t1_fe15za8,1578854287.0,I don't think he's physically gone beyond yet. It seems we saw him using 100% of what he's mentally able to push but there's definitely room for growth.
therewasanattempt,fe2vq9d,t1_fe2cptb,1578843370.0,"Miami here, I leave my car unlocked and my window still got smashed. Idiots, if you want to go through my glove box just open the door! It is annoying to come back to a a strewn about glovebox. Has only happened twice in the last 5 years though."

interestingasfuck,fdqwv6p,t1_fdqt4a8,1578676025.0,Well there was the time a town tried to clear a beached whale carcass with TNT. I assume it would be similar to that. Maybe less raining of chunks and more horizontal splash.
pcgaming,fdqu4lp,t1_fdqnp3c,1578674921.0,The hidden blade stopped being a 1-hit kill with Origins I believe. You needed to spec into it using the talent tree. But yeah the game become less about the story and gameplay and more micromanaging monotonous details.
reactiongifs,fdqdpdw,t1_fdqdev7,1578663946.0,Then it will be awkward.

Yeah being a celebrity sucks but that's the downside to being rich and famous, the people are what made you."
aww,fdlh0vn,t1_fdl0zkv,1578523836.0,When you've gone a bit too far in edibles it's like you don't even want to move your hands. You lift your arms but it feels like being puppeted with strings.
worldnews,fdlg93f,t1_fdlfnu8,1578523368.0,It's possible to make points without insulting people.
MovieDetails,fdl8q6v,t1_fdkiya0,1578518956.0,His nametag came off after a week for me. And this was a first gen model I bought at Disney the year the movie came out.

science,fdjyyoa,t1_fdjyled,1578491800.0,Yep the spectrum of autism has branched out significantly in the last decade thus a correlation with an increase in autism because more people are being diagnosed. Unfortunately people use that statistic way out of context to further their misguided agenda.

educationalgifs,fdgr4oy,t1_fdgpkv8,1578406159.0,Some government jobs are like this as well. I've had a friend who tested positive and was sent home for 2 weeks.

wholesomebpt,fdglkz0,t3_el8reg,1578401419.0,I was throwing away a mirror so I put it by the curb. Next morning there was a peacock staring at his reflection for half an hour. Had to put something over it so the damn thing wouldn't stand in the middle of the street.
todayilearned,fdfdcmb,t1_fdf8nl7,1578359036.0,"So this sounds like a typical situation where the government has to ""officially"" throw stuff out even if it's usable/fixable because it's not worth the cost or the insurance has already been paid out. This guy saw the cars about to be tossed and decided to take them and fix them. So yeah it wasn't really direct theft."

Games,fdem6ha,t1_fdeg1sl,1578341961.0,"That's the problem, I hate that my ISP's function like a god damn lease I have to go renew every year. I already hate going to a dealership I shouldn't have to negotiate with my ISP too."
Games,fdem0lr,t1_fde4ii5,1578341864.0,"It's a shame too, I have a few ranch buddies, they would die for a real horse simulator game. One of them plays Red Dead specifically to enjoy the horse riding/taming and nothing else. He spends all his gold just accessorizing his horses. Simulators feel gender neutral anyway, I loved pet caring games as a kid, Petz/Nintendogs/Creatures. Heck I still play Sims every now and then, something about just watching the progress of virtual life unfold before your eyes can be soothing."

pcgaming,fdek4kk,t1_fdejskl,1578340727.0,"You just listed my childhood. I started a bit later at 11 with Anarchy Online but yep played almost all those post-AO. The MMO culture was strongly ingrained from an early age for me, these kids grew up buying loot boxes and spamming erector sets."
funny,fdefg8k,t1_fdedz1c,1578337865.0,"It's a fine line, I have had gatherings with close friends, toast a glass of whisky by the fire stuff like that and have a good time but when it comes to nightlife and ""club girls"" they can get really pushy, some guys too. I think it makes them feel weird so I'll force myself to get an incredibly watered down gin and tonic or just sneak to the bar and get a ginger ale. Basically if I am not holding a drink I just get weird looks. I feel bad for genuine recovering alcoholics, you really need to make a complete lifestyle change to get away from it including cutting off some friends and ""family""."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fdee542,t1_fde81n7,1578337048.0,"Same tbh, for native Florida people it's too fucking hot to wear clothes so most are already half naked anyway. Seeing someone's leg isn't very sexual. You can literally sexualize anything anyway."
funny,fdeb0p9,t1_fde9ygq,1578335096.0,That's just alcohol culture in general unfortunately. I've had people get upset at me for NOT drinking.
pcgaming,fdeaa4r,t1_fde9ol1,1578334630.0,It's not so much the platform as it is the service and infrastructure. Until there's nationwide improvements and reduced/removed bandwidth caps Stadia is only attractive to a much smaller portion of users.
pcgaming,fde8f0l,t1_fde76d8,1578333448.0,"Outrage culture is definitely a factor when it comes to Reddit discussion. Sadly you can thank the karma system for that. It's easier to poke fun and gain points than to put the effort to defend the thing you love which will be downvoted into obscurity. At least you're enjoying it, that's all that matters. I just don't think the infrastructure is in place for most people yet for game streaming to take off."

pcgaming,fddq7ox,t1_fdc9vhh,1578321039.0,"Toxicity was at it's lowest when stats and arrangements were done outside of the platform. Like Counter-Strike 1.6, you had people who just casual played using the server browser or you had to join a website like CAL which kept its own stat tracking and community for competitive purposes. You also had to build your own team from scratch, none of this matchmaking rando shit. This kept both communities entirely separated which made it harder to troll. You couldn't really troll in competitive because you'd be blacklisted immediately and in casual it was hard to troll because no one really gave a fuck."
pcgaming,fddps2b,t1_fd9x8kb,1578320684.0,Love to watch TI but yeah the DOTA(MOBA) community is fucking horrid in game. No one wants to be berated for an hour before losing and trying again. Yeah I could mute the chat but this is suppose to be a team game.
pcgaming,fddpl48,t1_fdbg4w0,1578320520.0,"We're living in a generation where kids born post-WoW don't really have a strong grasp of MMO basics and mechanics. Most of us grew up playing MMO after MMO for years and have a good grasp on interface and controls cause lets face it, almost every MMO post-WoW has tried to recreate that same feel. Tried to get my 10/yo Fortnite nephews on the MMO bandwagon once and it took them quite awhile to adapt to it but they eventually got bored because they felt it was too slow.

Any more then I'll need big muffs but they get in the way of good practice aiming imo and then my ears start cramping. Silencers aren't even that quiet they just help muffle the sound slightly.

Dog is standing in the middle of the street.  
Driver begins swerving left possibly to get around him on the free side not expecting the dog to get up and turn around.  
Dog gets up immediately turns around in direction of bikes path.  
Dog does a 180 and goes the other way.  
Bike makes same manuveour almost simultaneously.   
Dog sees this and does another 180.  
Bike again turns almost immediately in the same direction upon which he loses control and goes into the fence.
