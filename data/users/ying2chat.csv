MealPrepSunday,ff9xxxi,t3_eshdzu,1579723909.0,"Made 16 breakfast burritos to freeze and consume, had one today for lunch and was so proud of myself haha.

These are so easy:
Breakfast sausage 
Eggs
Spinach
Diced potatoes
Mexican blend cheese
Salsa (from a jar - not homemade)

In the freezer! I‚Äôm hoping to become better at meal prep but this was a small start."
puppy101,ff8baem,t1_ff7soh6,1579671678.0,"I did this too! I do think my pup is lower energy and that contributes, but he also gets out at least 4 miles a day of energy and training in 10 min spurts.

When he was a baby I wouldn‚Äôt feed him with a bowl, I‚Äôd take his allocated kibble and hand feed him every couple seconds when I was chilling. 

He‚Äôs almost 1 year old but he‚Äôs been really great about settling since 7-8 months. 
I recommend making sure your guy is exhausted from outdoor activity, comes home to cool down, then gets to chill"

puppy101,ff4feco,t3_eriqtz,1579562300.0,"Outdoor decorations. 

Those stone lions some people have as a decoration outside their homes. It‚Äôs so funny because my puppy has walked right past those stone lions 100s of times. There are like three houses on our usual route that have them out. 

However one night it was late and dark, and he suddenly decided those stone lions were horrifying. He was crying and trying to run away. He‚Äôs now gone back to ignoring them though. 
He is always scared of any like garden gnome or wreath that just shows up sometimes. Christmas decorations did not please him."
puppy101,ff4f2dh,t1_ff495uj,1579562075.0,"Same with my puppy! I think I socialized him too much with kids when he was a baby. We had some adorable and rambunctious toddler and kid neighbors and they would jump all over him, let him knock them over and kiss them, and they would run around together at the park for hours. 

So great, he‚Äôs good with kids right? No... now that he‚Äôs about 50 lbs heavier I don‚Äôt even let him around smaller children cause he play bows and then proceeds to jump on them and knock them over. If he sees a kid sitting down, it‚Äôs all over. He bum rushes them and whines in excitement and tries to lick off their ears. Most kids don‚Äôt love it."

puppy101,fencown,t3_epya6m,1579281863.0,"I was walking my guy when he was around 6 months old, as usual he spotted another dog across the street and was whining and pulling to get over there.

Before I could use my treat arsenal to distract him and keep going this super old man comes up to me and said, ""you probably shouldn't have him if you can't control him...JUST SAYING YOU MIGHT WANT TO GIVE HIM UP""

I just found it so off putting cause clearly I CAN control him (he was pulling the leash and not pulling me) and also just kind of hilarious because at the time my guy was max 35 lbs. and why would I give up my baby?

I could go on about so many people stopping me and saying weird things like ""oh he really wants to go hunting"" and ""he needs a coat!"" or ""He don't need that coat"" depending on the day."

relationship_advice,fel2eqp,t3_epmn97,1579212585.0,"Ok, I want to preface this by saying I love my dog, I let my dog sleep with us in bed (on top of the sheets only). I am a big dog person. That being said.

Wow what? Her dog sounds disgusting and out of control. The fact that he growls at you and has drawn blood is a BIG warning sign. He seems to be resource guarding her and you never know if he could snap at you and rip your face off in the middle of the night.

Secondly, has this dog ever been trained or bathed or anything? Does it not go to the vet? Why does it have a yeast infection between its toes? If your gf won't compromise on not letting the dog sleep on the bed, will she at least get doggie wipes and wipe his feet before bed? Also take him to the groomer jesus christ. 

Also, does your girlfriend not clean? You say the sheets are itchy and blankets stink. Why don't you suggest washing the sheets and blankets more often? Even replacing them is an option.

&#x200B;

Finally, she had him for 6 years and just hasn't trained him one bit? I struggle to see how she can afford a million dollar home but also take him out 15x a day while catering to his every need but also not care enough or be too poor to take him to the vet/groomers/training  classes.

Honestly, the advice I can offer is: If you want to continue this relationship just tell her you don't want to sleep over as much and list off these reasons as why. Of course you can use a bit more tact here. Even offer to help her clean or help take the dog to the vet to get the ball rolling. He doesn't sound like a bad dog, she just sounds like a crap dog owner."
Toreba,fekwed7,t1_feku4r3,1579208986.0,"Thank you! I have already started doing that and I'm having fun with it :) of course selling them will not come close to making my money back, but it will lessen the pain haha.

Dogtraining,fekowbr,t1_fekh2f3,1579204557.0,"Thanks for the tips! I have been toying with getting a basic camera for the living room to keep tabs on him while we are away. I think I will end up getting him one and setting it up just to make sure he's not anxious.

He used to be crated and that's when he ate kongs and everything very well. Now he has full reign of the house, I wonder if he is more comfortable being crated. The only thing is, he never seems anxious when we get back. Sometimes he's actually sleeping on the couch or his bed and makes a huge lazy show of yawning and stretching before greeting me. Even right now, I am working from home so in an office with the door open. He's gone off to sleep on the couch.

We did the classic separation work when he was a puppy so it may be time to just go back to the basics. Admittedly we have been a bit lazier on his training and trusting him a lot these days.

Thanks again for your helpful response!"
Dogtraining,fekf1vt,t1_fejw08b,1579198691.0,"Yeah, he used to get one when we had to leave. I hope it's not the case, any tidbits on how to stop it from starting? He doesn't seem like an overly anxious guy and like I mentioned doesn't whine or bark when we leave."
Dogtraining,fejmtsq,t1_fej8gny,1579180185.0,We switched kibble a few weeks ago and he was happily eating it for the first two or three weeks. So not really sure if that‚Äôs the true reason.
Dogtraining,fej1ybv,t1_feia82n,1579153944.0,"Of course, I always tell him he doesn't pay rent so he has no right to be picky! I'll try switching his food around or at least doing half and half of his more preferred kibble. Thanks!"
Dogtraining,fej1vfb,t1_fei7gwk,1579153867.0,"I was thinking that might be the solution, but I'm worried that it will teach my dog to be even more dependent on me and not eat when I'm not around.

I'm hoping that's not the case and he's just being a brat about his kibble or something"
Dogtraining,fei7wau,t1_fei72om,1579132257.0,"Kibble strike hahaha I hate that they do it but I love the term you gave it! 

He takes any and all treats and just got a teeth cleaning a month ago with a clean bill of health from the vet so that might be it! I‚Äôm worried he just doesn‚Äôt like Pro Plan. My SO bought a 25 lb bag üò∞üòÖ"

AmItheAsshole,fedxp0a,t3_eoley4,1579022087.0,"Just throwing another YTA out there. Yes I agree, weddings are expensive and wedding dresses are expensive - but for good reason. 

You sound like you don‚Äôt realize the cost of clothing items, especially women‚Äôs clothing. Not saying that‚Äôs a bad thing in general, but he would behoove you to defer to your wife and future MIL to make these decisions. 

$50-100 is cheap for a dress. I have casual summer dresses that cost more than $100. 

As excuse me ‚Äúrecommended app Wish‚Äù recommended by WHO? I don‚Äôt even trust wish for basic tank tops or camisoles. Much less a wedding dress.

Finally, this is your future wife. This is not a hill to die on, you need to be comfortable trusting her choices and not be policing her money."

I would say keep at it! Maybe just use the small crate for night time when you guys can‚Äôt really watch her like a hawk? 

For the nipping, could it be she‚Äôs over tired? When my guy got nippy I stuck him in the crate and he would always pass out in a few minutes!"

11 weeks is too small to really hold it for like more than a few hours at a time. I recommend taking her out immediately after eating, drinking, and playing! If you can catch her in the act of potty inside her crate a quick ‚Äúno!‚Äù And pick her up and take her outside. (Yes you may get peed on).

Make sure you‚Äôre praising her with a party and treats when she does go outside! Good luck!!!"

Dogtraining,fb53ipg,t3_ebi323,1576520308.0,"Does your 10 month old object to being in the crate? I would just be nervous about making the puppy dependent on the 10 month old to settle.

Plus, I'm sure your 10 month old would like to have her own space and not have to be with the baby all the time. You've kind of trained the puppy to whine and think that whining will get her sister in the crate with her.

I would recommend getting each their own crate (can be put close together) and feeding them their meals in the crate. Or, if the 10 month old no longer likes/needs crate time, just putting the pup in the crate. How long is the puppy in the crate for? I would reward every time she is silent and settles in on her own. Those puppy whines are super annoying but try not to give in! you can do it :)"
