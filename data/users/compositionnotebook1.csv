I read the summary for the way of kings and I totally see what you mean!! I’m gonna start this tonight, thanks!"
StarWars,ff7jrp7,t1_ff7jlp7,1579651196.0,"Working on the Pinterest board. The funny thing is that I had already been thinking about a fanfic idea where two Jedis in training are friends at the temple in coruscant, through their education and then begin to deviate as they experience life as a Padawan. One stays a Jedi, the other becomes a sith, so it’d be like the before and after as they have to face each other once again when they’re become their individual titles. But this medieval setting would be perfect for it!! Ancient orders, low tech, not totally explained magical components that seem blasphemous to outsiders, more space to make it less of an Ahsoka/Anakin copy cat.

I’ll look into it! I’ve never read any of his books but I’ve heard good things. Thanks for the rec."
StarWars,ff7fbsj,t1_ff7eor8,1579648238.0,"I was thinking about the whole good vs evil aspect (what would a medieval force look like or a medieval Jedi Order vs Sith) that could exist within that time frame. But your idea sounds cool!!

I’m gonna have to go write some fanfic now..."

bulletjournal,fezzbta,t1_fezz0ua,1579463484.0,It is!! And my comment does detract from how freaking GOOD the insignia with the year. So kudos to you.
aspergirls,fezxb4z,t1_fezd0gq,1579462893.0,Maybe? I guess it’s really person dependent. My SO has hot coffee with hot meals beyond breakfast and my mom has no issues with the hot/hot combo. If anything she likes it too much because she loved to make soup in the middle of summer when I was a kid and of course that’s the worst thing to eat in the summer if you’re sensitive to sensory issues.
bulletjournal,fezx0je,t1_fezvhn6,1579462771.0,"Of course! I meant no offense it was just more like it didn’t exactly match so I found it jarring.

(FWIW, you don’t have to explain yourself to me. It’s your bullet journal and it’s personal. Who cares what a stranger on the internet thinks, y’know?)"

StarWarsEU,feyu87q,t1_feysgki,1579450580.0,Plagueis is also on my list! Plagueis first or should I read the bane books first?
aspergirls,feyu552,t1_feyqu75,1579450548.0,"Thanks a lot for this. I know what you mean about the hot and cold (grew up in California. I need to live somewhere temperate, I feel like there’s no winning).

These are great ideas. I have multiple gloves for different purposes. I just got some heavy duty super warm gloves but I’m gonna also pack my lighter fleece ones so I have options to cool down but not freeze my hands.

Shoes are already broken in, that’s set. I was gifted some wool socks and I was hesitant about them but I’ve gotten a lot of responses to try them so I will. I’ll try wearing them with my more comfortable/fashion boots that don’t overheat my feet. That’ll be a pre-trip test to see how warm they keep me.

Got sunglasses. Snow blindness is real, and I hate it lol. I don’t mind the hat too much, though I do have some big scarves and while they are warm, sometimes it’s just too much, so I’m gonna go find a small one to keep with me. The big ones are great to use as extra pressure or warmth on my lap but around my neck it’s just a lot."
StarWarsEU,feys8ng,t1_feyr3ui,1579449966.0,"It’s on my list! This month so far I read the first Republic Commandos book and Battle Surgeons (first StarMed). I like that they feel like “quiet” Star Wars books (ie not part of the Skywalkers - not a big, sweeping saga). I’m also watching The Clone Wars and am mostly caught up in my rewatch of the prequel movies.

I’m conflicted because I’d like to read something a little different. Definitely very interested in how the Force works and I have the rise of the sith comics on my list. I was thinking about going back to Republic Commandos but I’d like to read one more thing before I do.

This is the long way of me asking if you’d think the Darth bane books should be bumped up? I’ve heard mixed things about it. I’m almost done with reading the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and ready to go back to reading something Star Wars."
StarWarsEU,feyok8q,t3_eqw6h3,1579448345.0,No such thing!! I’m trying to pace myself because I know if I go to overboard I will burnout. Forcing myself to read a non Star Wars graphic novel while I ponder which novel to read next (definitely staying within the prequels/rise of the sith/clone wars era).
bulletjournal,feyo4m9,t1_fexxjvp,1579448110.0,I was thinking the same thing. The rebel insignia doesn’t have much to do with the Mandalorian plot.
aspergirls,feyl3fl,t1_fexsygd,1579447024.0,Nope lol my SO and my mom don’t have that issue. My mom even commented once when I was having a breakfast burrito and a hot coffee. She was like “is your burrito spicy?” (Not that level of spicy). I switched to ice water and then I was fine.
aspergirls,fexz0fd,t1_fexcep5,1579438564.0,"Thanks for this response! I’m going to the winter carnival in Quebec City. I’ve been to Montreal and Toronto before, but not in the dead of winter (Toronto has similar weather to me since we’re pretty close in distance). 

So it’ll be mostly just popping in somewhere for food or a shop, we’ve got some stops on our list (museums, go see the observation deck, aquarium) but most of what we want to do is outside. 

Good to know you also wear fashion boots out!! Those boots are much easier for me to slip in and out of (my winter boots are heavy duty). I wasn’t sure if I could get by wearing my fashion boots as I do now. Keeping my feet colder is definitely helpful in the long run when I move in/out of places."

aspergirls,feul3o0,t1_feto4tu,1579387583.0,"Most of the days I think will be just sightseeing/walking and some minor activity (tabagoning, maybe dog sledding).

I do the unzipping thing when I’m stuck driving and the car gets too warm but it’s too cold to turn the heater off. I’ll definitely do that in public as long as my feet don’t sweat too much hahah

I love the thermos idea. I was already thinking about bringing my insulated water bottle (it’s steel and when it’s filled with cold water it feels nice). I’ll definitely bring it."
aspergirls,feukj4p,t1_feuiy1m,1579387383.0,Okay that’s good to know. Thanks!
aspergirls,feukfju,t1_fety90j,1579387349.0,"Blanket scarves are a great idea, I’ll look into it! Thanks! We also have those big heater blowers pushing hot air in at storefronts. I did buy a fleece zip up and I’ll make sure to bring that with me.

I almost wish we were bringing a stroller now haha it’s just me and my SO, no kids. We’re going to the winter carnival in Quebec City. 😊 Not my first visit to Canada but my first one in the middle of winter, and that far north."
aspergirls,fetn7jl,t1_fetkdqs,1579377102.0,"These are great ideas! Thank you! I had also thought about using my thermals as my base layer with a light sweater on top and then the full jacket, all layers included. At home, I can usually get away with a shirt/thin long sleeve, light sweater, and my more medium- cold weather coat throughout my day at work and school.

I agree with your boot thoughts. They’re definitely my trickiest piece. The boots I wear most days are motorcycle boots but they’re definitely more fashion related and are not lined or waterproof in any way (they do have decent grip for icy days, these are my second pair I’ve owned in 4 years. My old pair I wore every day in winter - snow or not - and they held up surprisingly well). I wonder if it’s just easier to bring these instead of my fuzzy snow boots.

What kinds of socks do you use? My mom sent me wool socks but I’m scared to use them because I’m worried they’ll shrink. Right now I have some softer boot socks but they not very thick."

bulletjournal,fdssrd2,t1_fdsqdvb,1578707465.0,Well they’re ballpoint pens so they should dry much faster than gel pens.

bulletjournal,fdnbuav,t3_elitxx,1578582415.0,"I totally agree! I used one off and on last year, doing the ~aesthetic~ type thing and it kinda sorta worked once I started adding in long form daily journaling and then began tracking my late in life diagnosis of aspergers/attention span issues.

This year I decided to just throw everything at it - daily journaling, mood/sensory tracking, building my own workouts, foods that work with my autism issues, special interest pages, etc in addition to the planner type things around work and school.

What a difference."
bulletjournal,fdn4qp3,t3_em87dq,1578577234.0,"Anyone using a blackout book? How do you use it on the go? Are there metallic pens that aren’t gel pens? I’m thinking about using it for my next bullet journal but I’m concerned about the functionality of the metallic gel pens. If I’m at the doctor, for example, and I write in the next appointment in gel pen, I can’t write it and close it, I have to wait several minutes to dry. What sort of pens are you guys using??"
