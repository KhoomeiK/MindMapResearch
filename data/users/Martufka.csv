Sending you all the love, share it with people around! (And cookies. We need to share more cookies.)"
infp,ffj4mu7,t3_etr83r,1579990275.0,"Like many I upvote when I like something. And I like your art. And I would like it even if it wasn't really good because the most important thing is that what is behind the canvas. Am expression of freedom. The fact that we're not professionals, we don't need to be perfect. We're not products of our capitalistic society, we are people. And love of the most humane thing is to create. No matter what. No matter the quality. Just create. Give it our best. That is why I like it. That is why I like anyone who creates.

Sending you all my love, enjoy a pleasant evening! ^^"

Sokrates was right, listening to your inner voice is really important."
offmychest,fd8tq2k,t3_ekbdgj,1578223308.0,"HI! As I was reading your post, I couldn't help but felt really sorry. Man, such a terrible background. Personally, my parents got separated when I was 6/7 (it's hard to tell, they last saw each other when I was 6 but my father texted me ""happy name-day"" when I was 7...btw, I have birthday two weeks before my name-day. He forgot that one, I guess he just saw my name somewhere in a calendar...), fortunately, my mum isn't all that bad. Truth be told, I was...ostracised by the rest of the family. They held a grudge against me just because I was a daughter of my father, I had his genes and therefore was born a liar, cheat, a terrible person. Evil incarnate. They still tell me sometimes. I am happy though that, unlike you, they at least didn't have me homeschooled. If I didn't go to school, I wouldn't have the friends I have. And without friends...I would be defenceless against my family. Defenceless against anything.  
If all my relationships taught me one thing it is that being open about feelings and thoughts is the best course one can take. It's strangely empowering - you admit first to yourself that you are feeling this and as you say it out loud, it gains power and form. You suddenly see what you've been hiding to yourself is not all that awful. Yes, it can harm you, at times. Especially when you decide to share something with a terrible family member who is trying to manipulate you. Beware of those. But the majority of people...Majority of people you meet in your lifetime are really nice, I can promise you that. They are not evil for evil's sake and will try to help you as much as they can, provided they understand you. Finding trust is not something that comes easy, especially since you've been abandoned many times, basically betrayed by those you cared about. But such is life. If we refuse to grand ourselves the opportunity to experience, we rob ourselves of something amazing - of the greatest adventures and experiences we could have had.  
Stay strong, my man, stay strong. And don't be afraid.  


P.S.: The last sentence made me think of a question I heard recently, an amazing one. ""What would I do if I were not afraid of anything?"""
offmychest,fd8puvw,t3_ekbdjf,1578221582.0,"Hey buddy. Just wanted to say - you cannot be further from the truth. It is not that everything you do is wrong, not at all, the only thing wrong here is your family. You don't deserve to be treated that way, no one does. We all need love to flourish, especially from family. And you, my amazing human being, you don't get it no matter what, no matter how hard you try. And yet you are able to survive. I admire you. In this field, you win by all means.  
Sending you all the virtual hugs - keep on going!"
offmychest,fd86z99,t3_ek5z0a,1578214574.0,"I know that feeling, I very much do. And I feel pity for you, for what's going on in your life. You know, my life is/was no different for the longest time possible. When I was 6-10, I never had a proper friendship. I was always the odd one. The one that was laughed at and sent to play with someone else. And I didn't mind all that much back then since I was quite charismatic and able to convince the other kids to spend some time with me. Time has passed and fortunately, I do have some great friends (great doesn't do it justice, they are totally absolutely amazing) but still, when there's a party, I don't usually get invited. Sometimes I get forgotten. In the past, several years ago, that hurt a lot. Every instance of them leaving me behind...it was like a new scar to what was already an impressive collection. Even this New Year's Eve...I was invited at first but then there were some changes to the organisation and somehow they have forgotten to count me in as well. I was so afraid I would end up alone on New Year's...Fortunately for me, the ""party"" ended up being in my house, it was six of us there.  
Looking back at everything, I don't think people leave us out intentionally.  
For my friends, I guess they thought I don't like to party. And that's right, I don't. I don't like being around strangers drinking, I don't like the atmosphere which is hardly ever safe. But I also don't like being left out.  
Maybe they were trying to go for the lesser evil. Maybe they just had a lot to deal with organisation-wise. Maybe life just got in the way and they really forgot. Guess it has nothing to do with our personality, with us as people whatsoever.  
I don't think there's such thing as ""being number one"". If your friends love you, that's all that's needed, just enjoy your time with them, enjoy their presence and if you want to be included make them see. Say yes to weird things. Say yes to love.  
Have a wonderful day. :)"
offmychest,fd83bhq,t3_ek6u5r,1578213461.0,"Hey, buddy, I am sending you all the love I can, just like everyone here. I really hope it all gets better. And thank you. You, know, from time to time it's great to hear not only supportive words but also the fact that life is not perfect and that despite our struggles being fundamentally different, we end up feeling quite similar emotions - we are all empty inside, tired of all the bs around us, scared of what is to come. Even though you know nothing about me, we're both strangers here on the Internet, I kinda feel understood by you. And for that, of that amazing, liberating feeling, I thank you."
