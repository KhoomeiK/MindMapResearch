those who survive will lead to a future of socially isolated shut ins

i'm joking. only partially. if there is an underlying biological mechanism to asocial behavior, and those are the genes that survive..."

and these price fluctuations are what?

reflections of underlying technical progress? people researching advances and buying on implications to network advancement?

no, the prices are just empty casino games to rob crypto bros

the markets are a joke. con men and suckers"

i don't think i would go to the hospital at all. that's how you would get infected if you weren't

what is the treatment anyway? fluids? there's no cure. it's too late for tamiflu

respiratory help i can see. difficulty breathing. who knows if they have enough equipment/ staff

but then you are at death's door. go then. until then: avoid the hospital, i think. correct me if i'm wrong"
CryptoCurrency,ffi7wut,t1_ffi7bua,1579967407.0,"but isn't that just a casino?

$BTC is a stunted store of value. slow, does not scale, disgusting electricity use for mining, no quantum resistance

but you can play silly financial games with it! yay!

other projects are achieving the dream of DLT

crypto bros have stopped caring about that

are we here to play silly casino games or build the future?"
askscience,ffhh44w,t1_ffhfb1e,1579934985.0,"no

from a strictly personal point of view the risk assessment is the same:

low chance of high deadly is way better than high chance of low deadly in terms of threat to your life

it's just math"

it's way too early to know that. you need to cite that number or it's not trustworthy"
askscience,ffheu6q,t1_ffheiku,1579932312.0,"well yeah we're all going to die. but the topic is ""die soon from this disease."" then it's just math: low lethality but high spreadability is worse for you than high lethality but low spreadabliity. just as a matter of playing the odds. of course, like you say, they're all frightening horrors, and to die miserably matters too, regardless of the odds"
askscience,ffhekt0,t1_ffhdy4g,1579932025.0,"there's a new viral mutations constantly. in one person's sickness there could be hundreds or thousands of mutations. in that one person. it depends upon the virus

it's just that only one out of trillions of mutations confers any sort of real evolutionary advantage. most are random and inconsequential or even defeating to the virus

but the virus just keeps playing those odds. and eventually one little virus particle will hit the lottery jackpot and hit on something genuinely completely new and deadly... and cut a scythe of death across thousands or millions of people"

blass?

also: wow corning, you're impressive. you've been wowing us with this type of materials science innovation for decades. many other big players in many other industries peter out and lose their steam. you just keep chugging along in what at first glance seems dead end: ""plain old"" glass!"
webdev,ffhcabh,t1_ffhatbg,1579929645.0,"There is no such thing as working on a job and not learning anything.

""Learning on the job"" is not a guy going ""not right now boss I'm trying to watch this youtube tutorial"" it's the policies and procedures and methodology which is unique to every job and informs the employee of what makes sense at that company, right or wrong, that adds to what we call experience.

And if a company hires a guy who knows nothing about the primary skillset and needs to actually watch youtube tutorials, that's on the company's shoddy hiring practices."
askscience,ffhbo11,t1_ffhbdcv,1579929033.0,"I'm not gatekeeping. Talk about whatever you want dude.

And that applies to me as well: I'm simply saying the side topic isn't a meaningful evaluation of a threat. Ironically you're gatekeeping by saying I can't say that. Lol!"
askscience,ffhbh0u,t1_ffhaywo,1579928840.0,You're not playing the odds well. Tiny chance of almost certain death is better odds than fifty fifty chance of small possibility of death.

And the low chance of getting it now is true only currently.

It could fizzle out.

It could also not fizzle out. Your chances could leapfrog exponentially. Or not.

No one knows."
askscience,ffhb542,t1_ffhaulh,1579928521.0,"I'm not talking about interesting to I'm talking about meaningfulness.

If we're at a pizza shop and we need to decide what toppings it might be interesting for you to announce that you like anime, but that doesn't help us pick toppings.

Going off on a tangent is perfectly fine. Talk about whatever you want.

I'm saying talking about lethality alone doesn't help us say anything meaningful about the coronavirus.

You think I'm gatekeeping. I'm talking usefulness to evaluating coronovirus."
askscience,ffhag6e,t1_ffhaa52,1579927874.0,"Making that point has no value because it's about lethality and spreadability, not lethality alone. It's not useful to look at lethality alone. Especially on this topic."
askscience,ffh9q2q,t1_ffh7xlh,1579927215.0,"Something that spreads easier but is less lethal is more dangerous.

Think of the odds:

1. 0.5% chance of catching something 90% lethal.

2. 50% chance of catching something 10% lethal.

I'm making these numbers up but a coronavirus (2) is scarier than ebola (1)"
askscience,ffh9fuz,t1_ffh7v0v,1579926961.0,"Because it's brand new and has the potential to be worse than flu.

I can't say it will be. You also can't say it won't be. No one knows."
askscience,ffh92n4,t1_ffh78bt,1579926638.0,"That's couching the problem in such a way that makes it seem better when the person you're replying to accurately described coronavirus as worse than ebola. Which is the real take home here.

It's like this:

Would you rather have a 0.005% chance of getting something that killed you 90% chance?

Or a 50% chance of getting something that killed you 10% chance?

I'm making the numbers up. The point is something that spreads easier, even with a lower mortality rate, is way way more deadly and a much more dangerous threat to you."

We evolved to just slowly outrun our prey as they sprinted and then rested, sprinted then rested, etc... but we never stopped, slowly closing the gap over hours, until they were exhausted and we finished them off.

Kinda creepy.
