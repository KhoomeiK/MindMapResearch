Spanish,ffmgm3w,t1_ffjea65,1580054372.0,"You can guess pretty accurately how it is pronounced by reading it, but accurately writing a word from its pronunciation is a bit more difficult. You have to know which silent letters go where. There is a little bit of that in German (like knowing when to write ss and when to write ﬂ; there are rules for that but they're a bit complicated), but not nearly on as large a scale as French. 

Also, what do you mean by ""ie"" not being pronounced exactly as written? It's always pronounced the same way with very few exceptions (such as Familie), so it's no different than things like ""au"" or ""oi"" in French."
starterpacks,ffmfwft,t3_eu5hkx,1580054124.0,"Reading something that a person wrote online in their non-native language is not an accurate assessment of their actual language skills. It's much easier to write something in your second (or third or fourth) language than it is to speak at a native pace without any grammatical errors. Also, most language learners would rather learn to speak the language like a native would speak it and not like a robotic dictionary."
Spanish,ffj06d8,t1_ffivdz1,1579987065.0,"Yeah but ¸ is pronounced different than u and so on. German spelling is not completely perfect, but it's much more standard than other languages like English and French. When you read a German word, you can pretty accurately guess how it will be pronounced."

Honestly, I think it's best to just remember ""Thirty days hath September, April, June, and November."" Everybody knows the situation with February, and it's easy to remember that the rest have thirty-one."

EnglishLearning,ff38zbl,t1_ff28b1c,1579536509.0,"I know it can refer to a single strand, but I was just clarifying that the word ""hair"" cannot be grammatically plural; it can be either a countable noun referring to a singular strand (for which the plural is ""hairs"") or an uncountable noun referring to the whole mass (for which there exists no plural). It can never be plural, which would allow for sentences like ""My hair are long."""

EnglishLearning,ff26wub,t1_ff08icp,1579495533.0,"""Hair"" can't exactly be a plural noun, but it can be an uncountable noun that refers to all the hairs on your head (or arm, leg, etc.). This is why you could never say something like ""My hair are long."" When you say ""hairs,"" you're emphasizing specific strands of hair, but when you say ""hair,"" you're referring to all of it as a collective unit."
