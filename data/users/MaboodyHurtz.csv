The hypocrisy of it all was just maddening. And this isn't about bashing liberals because this happens constantly every day between groups aligned with any party.

And I am always reminded of one person who did exactly what everyone preaches but never practices - YouTuber Laci Green. 

If you don't know her, she's a liberal sex educator on YouTube. She actually reached out to her biggest anti-feminist internet troll Chris Ray Gun to meet and talk. They eventually started dating and many of her fans and supporters turned against her calling her a traitor. And she unapologetically goes through life despite the hate she gets from all sides. She had the courage to do what everyone loves to say needs to happen and was condemned for it.

Don't be a hypocritical moron. Be like Laci and Chris. There is always common ground and room for understanding if we just take the leap and try."
offmychest,fftgcik,t1_fft493s,1580219756.0,Every time a celebrity or otherwise well known person dies these people come out of the woodwork. To seek attention for a loss of a person you didn't know at all has got to be one of the lowest forms of self victimization I can think of. That shit really irks me.
offmychest,feeaxnp,t3_eog7oh,1579030011.0,"Wow, a lot of negativity here guys. This sub is called offthechest for a reason. A place to get something out that's bothering you and usually it's something that can be controversial.

I had a traumatic childhood myself. I've had friends that had a ""normal"" childhood express the same sentiments as OP. They tell me I'm strong because I don't use it as a crutch to excuse my behavior or go off the rails.

Yes everyone experiences trauma differently and heal differently. That's common sense. But suggesting that it's ok for people to 'deal' with it by using it as a free pass rather than face it and handle it in a healthy way is a disservice to them and to those who have worked so hard to overcome their past."
medical,e74ifn6,t1_e74hh0e,1538613962.0,"Thank you for your response! Muscle spasm makes the most sense to me. However, I didn't have lingering soreness/stiffness like usual after getting a charley horse. I mostly just felt exhausted from the entire experience. 

Another provider I talked to also mentioned sciatica, but the pain didn't radiate down a leg and I haven't had a recurrence since. 

If it was a simple muscle spasm then I suppose there really isn't anything I can do to prevent this from happening again, correct?"
