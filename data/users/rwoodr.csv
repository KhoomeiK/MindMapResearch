corgi,ff545nj,t1_ff40q9o,1579579724.0,Does your corgi ever just bury their nose and push along like a snow plow? Ours comes up with just a face (and whiskers) full of snow and ice. Shakes off. Does it again. The. Entire. Walk. It takes a long time to complete a block some days...
corgi,ff437c1,t1_ff3k93n,1579554551.0,They are just the silliest dogs and endlessly amusing!
corgi,ff3ip6r,t1_ff3c72d,1579541881.0,"He cracks me up because he will go out of his way to make trails all over. He will loop back in big circles and then follow his original trail back. Our backyard clearly shows his habits.

When the snow gets too deep for him, I go out in boots and make trails for him by dragging my feet and scooting along. I do the same when we go out for our walks. I walk ahead of him making a path for him. He always follow along until something catches his nose and then off he goes up over his torso in snow and starts bunny hopping around. Total trip to watch."
corgi,ff3icrf,t1_ff36aap,1579541669.0,I would be all for it. Would have to allow for a mean average as corgi do come in varying sizes. Still better then imperial though!
corgi,f9ci5jr,t1_f9b20w4,1575223989.0,I did immediately after. Couldn't resist!
