JRPG,fgxlutp,t1_fgxigoz,1581174067.0,"Most of the games in the series are not connected, and if they are it's only to the game before it. FE 3 is basically an expansion of FE 1, FE5 takes place as a side story during FE4, FE 7 is a prequel to FE6, FE10 is a sequel to FE9, and FE11 is a remake of FE1. 3 Houses isn't a bad first game, but it is very different than most of the other games. There's two fairly distinct types of Fire Emblem game, ones where you can grind it out on a world map, and ones where you can't. The ones where you can't tend to require more strategy because you can't just grind your units up to being invincible, and IMO are more rewarding. However, the ones with maps are much more newbie friendly. My recommendations for starting points are either Awakening or Three Houses because they have a lot of newbie friendly options, Sacred Stones on the GBA because it's the easiest of the older games by a good margin, Blazing Sword (just called Fire Emblem in English) because that was a lot of people's first FE game and it's a great balance of story and strategy, or Path of Radiance on the GC, because really it's just a great game. I would not recommend starting with Radiant Dawn, because it's both much harder that Path of Radiance and also a sequel, or any of the games from 6 or earlier, because most of them are very hard. 4 and 5 are my favorite games in the series, but they are absolutely not newbie friendly at all.

Tl:dr: Yeah its fine."
