Circular logic? We are discussing if it should be illegal. And what that ""if"" is.

Yes. But making it illegal carries with it much larger issues, that you would probably want less.Example: if we make it illegal to say anything bad about a person in public? Who do you think would exploit that the second it happened?

This is partly due to the problem that the women shy away from authorities and such, as it scares away the customer. IF one girl calls the police on a customer, she won't work lucratively there for very long. They are then left with the option of having criminals protect them, rather than being alone. Some do that of course to. To higher risk for themselves.  

They are also reluctant to approach charity organizations constructed to help them. Why? Because society doesn't treat those women any better even if they aren't chased by police.

Of course they are victims in some ways, but they've chosen to escape their poor lives by selling sexual services in a richer country. Are they any more victims than the 20 year old white female student, sleeping with 50 year old millionaires so she can have the latest iphone and go on luxury vacations?

Perhaps, but that must be because of her coming from a poor country, rather than choosing to sell sexual services to get out of it,  no?

The result of making this shit illegal, no matter the socioeconomic status of the prostitute, is just that it goes underground. And it becomes worse for those women. There isn't a single illegal thing that has ever stopped existing, and believing it would be any different for prostitution is at best naive, at worst...?

aww,feteoph,t1_ferdb8s,1579374654.0,"ugh. heartbreaking.... I've seen how it is to lose a dog. My parents dog got to live a fairly long life, but her going away due to illness at old age, my dad couldn't see her suffering any more, was devastating to both of them. They still talk about her now and then, 10 years after. It was like loosing a child, they say."
aww,fer0z5l,t1_fepzz4u,1579348385.0,They can smell disease on us. Im pretty sure a woman's body going into labor would be super obvious to a dog that cared about it.

AskReddit,fee54hg,t1_fedsdm9,1579026587.0,"Im still thinking it would be slightly biased towards larger penises, just because people volunteering for this would probably be less ""ashamed"" of their penis, and thus probably on the larger side.  


Would be interested to know how they would avoid this bias.  You have any links?"

technology,fdq6x44,t1_fdogysx,1578657474.0,"Im a computer tech and bought an apartment with new appliances around 2012.I shopped around asking questions, ofc the salesperson tried to push expcensive shit with: ""and you have 15 programs instead of just 8!"" ...So I naturally asked: ""And would I ever need those extra 7?"" ...""uuuuh.... ""

Yeh...not thanks. Make the appliances work, be quiet and not break down, and Im good. I know how computers work. I.e they dont.

All my appliances have not had 1 single service call on them. They all work flawlessly.

Protip: dont buy complicated expensive shit you will never use. It WILL break down, and you won't use any of the functions on it anyway. I usually go for the mid-tier stuff."
