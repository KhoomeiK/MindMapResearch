You’re the first guy he has to beat that’s the easy part it’s having enough space so a big can’t come down and swat that shit that’s he’s looking for. If your boys are too low in the paint he will just pull up or pass out. At least if they know how to play basketball

unpopularopinion,fcnqiu1,t1_fcnpz53,1577816533.0,They use a tactic where they flood the FDA with their own tests after a 3rd party puts out a study that shows the negative effects so “the data is in our favor by the sheer amount of ‘data’ we have” Monsanto in particular is quite famous for this. This is why everyone is ‘okay’ with spray diluted agent orange on their crops which is literally poison or how ‘nobody’ is okay with raw milk because “it causes polio” even though we have a vaccine but eating spoon fulls of sugar for breakfast everyday is perfectly ‘okay’ even though it will give you diabetes which you can’t even make a vaccine for.
