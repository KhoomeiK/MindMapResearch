LifeProTips,ffhkc8j,t3_etlpfn,1579939245.0,"Thank you so much, I will try this tomorrow. Needed that.. also a note for people who do get panic attacks, I find sitting on the floor of the shower with warm (/whatever temp soothes you the best) water running on you, while reading every single word on a shampoo bottle out loud (ingredients included) helps you bring you back into focus

Also with a cold juice or something at the same time."
