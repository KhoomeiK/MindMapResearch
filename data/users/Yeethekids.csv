You’re a great person, and I know I don’t know you but everybody is a great person that deserves life, and if they mess up they can start over. This sounds pretty hypocritical considering I cut myself an hour ago, but please don’t harm yourself, you don’t deserve it."

Everyone will know me as that person who tried to kill them self and all that, and everyone will think of me so differently, like I’m a fragile snowflake. Trust me, nothing you say to me can be worse than what I say to myself, you’re just proving my point. Another main point is my friends, like 6 people. I couldn’t do that to them, I couldn’t cause them that sadness, but I also think I’m a burden to them, so I’m stuck."
