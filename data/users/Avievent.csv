The man is dense when it comes to his health) 

His reading was 85- perfectly normal for the human body, especially right before a meal- and he felt like absolute shit because his body is so used to running at over 200. He thought he was dying because he hadn’t seen a number that low in years.

“Eat how you feel like.” Is a good way to eat yourself into HHNS."
fatlogic,ffagir4,t1_ffadscn,1579735216.0,"“Unlikely to lose 100lbs in a year.”

Nah, it’s perfectly possible to lose 100lbs in a year. That’s just around 2lbs a week and when you get to the point you have to lose 100+ pounds, it’s pretty easy if you can eat decent and count calories. 

This coming from someone who finally pulled their head out of their ass in September and has averaged ~2lbs a week down since then."

CleaningTips,ff68czg,t3_erkfrb,1579621537.0,I would probably try OxyClean. I’ve used it before on stained sections of my various chucks. It removed a stain from tomato sauce on a light blue pair- so I would assume it would remove it from white ones too.
CleaningTips,ff66h45,t1_ff5zg2n,1579620289.0,In the picture it’s a bit hard to tell- what are the marks? Pencil? Ink? What it is can make a big difference in what will work to remove it.

CleaningTips,fewzeez,t3_eqfzyt,1579421833.0,This is one instance in which I default to my ArmorAll cleaners. They have a heavy duty one I use in a farm truck I clean for my grandfather like twice a year and it works to help remove six months of build up from a working dairy farm without killing the plastic.

CleaningTips,feibywv,t3_eoc5yy,1579134938.0,"Would a bleach pen be a potential option or are there areas of color you’re trying to avoid?  

I regularly use a gel bleach pen on my white chucks to remove what chucking them in the washer doesn’t."
CleaningTips,feiba7f,t3_eozyw6,1579134479.0,"What worked really well for my shower (fiberglass that had soap scum and hard water build up from years):

Put vinegar in a spray bottle diluted with water (3:1 vinegar to water), dampen the walls and base of the tub with water, sprinkle with baking soda (especially any really bad spots), and then spray with vinegar to make the baking soda bubble. Walk away for ten-fifteen minutes and then come back and scrub with a scouting pad (I used the green scotch-brite ones) my tub  and shower walls are shiny for the first time since we bought the house. I didn’t know they even could be this shiny."
CleaningTips,fe4q4g9,t1_fdzas9q,1578861785.0,"I’m going to second these! We used them when I lived in an apartment with three roommates who absolutely loved sponges for some reason (and two who couldn’t cook and had a tendency to burn everything to a pan). 

I bought them after the normal cheap sponges would stink to high heaven from being left half wet in the corner of the sink and we could use them for 2-4 weeks (depending on who did dishes) before they crumbled but they never really stunk."
CleaningTips,fdpikb8,t1_fdp73h8,1578629584.0,"A seat protector probably wouldn’t be a bad idea simply to add waterproofing, even if you still use a moving blanket over it. My waterproof ‘hammock’ style seat protector was a lifesaver when my dog was sick and we ended up stuck in traffic."
LuLaNo,fdm8mbj,t1_fdlcxwg,1578542513.0,"I’ve just accepted i look like a busted can of biscuits in anything. So I wear my tacky, weird patterned leggings (most aren’t even LLR) and live my life as I work toward *not* looking like the pillsbury dough boy. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
YarnAddicts,fdeuewb,t3_ek7fu4,1578346817.0,"For first starting I definitely recommend a basic, cheaper acrylic yarn (I’m a fan of RedHeart Supersaver because it’s cheap and easy to find) and a basic pack of plastic or metal hooks (sizes G-J for most of your worsted weight yarns) if you have carpal tunnel, arthritis, or any other hand/wrist issues it is worth it to get the ergonomic hooks (no fun trying to get into something and ending up in pain)
Some of the ‘better’ yarns like wool, mohair, alpaca, etc. don’t hold up well to constant frogging and re-crocheting and can be a pain until you learn how to keep your tension. 

Depending on where you’re at will depend on where you have available to buy things. I’m in the middle of nowhere and my options are Walmart, Michaels, JoAnns, and Hobby Lobby or online. If you choose to get stuff at one of the three craft stores- check for coupons! They always have them listed online or in their apps.  

Tips- learn your basic handful of stitches (slip stitch, single, half-double, double, and treble) and practice, practice, practice!!

Welcome to the dark side!"
