5) Ability cards can be interesting

I had another hallucination where I thought I was fighting someone in my backyard, like fighting myself, fight club style. My slightly more sober friend watched this and told me all about it the next day.

I have also had false memories? Like I’ll tell a complete lie of a story while I’m drunk, then when I’m sober, the person will ask me if that story was true and I’m like “no...it was not” but I can vaguely remember telling the story and believing it was true at the time"

RedDeadOnline,ffs05m9,t3_euqtnf,1580169922.0,"What they need to do to save this game is to stop trying to make Wild West GTAO. They need to make this its own thing. People generally want to roleplay in this game, even if they don’t think they do. Even the griefers are just roleplaying the antagonists at the end of the day. There needs to be systems in place that allow the players to create their own stories without the need for cutscenes and rockstar missions.

- Bring back RDR1 Hardcore lobbies that are free-aim only, no player blips unless sprinting/shooting/talking.

- Add text chat

- Put emotes in the weapon wheel, and make them all accessible.

- Add private/invite only sessions

- Decrease player count/Increase dynamic events/animal population. The less players in a lobby, the more rich and detailed the world can be. I would gladly sacrifice player count if it meant me and my friends can enjoy more content in the world like Story Mode has.

- Add player trading, incentivize player interaction and socialization

- In Hardcore Lobbies, players should be spawned back at Camp whenever they are killed to discourage this back-and-forth bullshit. Somebody has to be the dead guy.

- Persistent Posses should be more than just a nametag, they should operate more like the gang in Story Mode in that each member can contribute in some way, be it through chores or donations.

- NPC, Shop, Bank, Train Robberies and Heists. Let us be actual outlaws. This should be top priority, actually. This should go without saying.

- Allow players to remove their gun belts. Allow us to take passive occupations and do immersive, boring shit and play the regular guy for once. Add a shit ton of amazing animation that Rockstar is famous for. The more interaction with any object, the better

-  Add things like a wrist-only lasso, player-on-player robbery, player owned coaches, cabins, apartments, shops, ranches... the community would flourish

I could seriously go on and on. This game can really blow up if they would stop copying GTA and treat it like its own thing, with its own audience."
