Try a standing windmill and gradually raise your hips to be higher and higher. When you feel you're ready, try a handstand to windmill by winding up your legs and swinging down. Remember to use your momentum to guide yourself directly to your upper back and that you don't have to use an elbowstand while going down. Once you have that down you'll want to get a nice coin drop so you can go straight from 90s to your back with one arm. There's some good [coindrop tutorials](https://youtu.be/KK1KILMiMDw) on youtube if you want to check them out. Finally, you can add the tap mill to the coin drop to soften then landing. It's a little scary at first but it becomes a lot easier once you get it down."

pics,ffkxtdx,t1_ffkv8gx,1580030916.0,I did. I answered both. Bernie's campaign will handle the matter internally. We aren't owed the knowledge of Kyle Jurek's fate. Especially since we have no idea what the context was. Jurek has a history of substance abuse and the poor fool looks like he went boozing with someone and got plastered. No one wants to riot.

You operate under the false pretense that a significant number of Bernie supporters are communists when they simply aren't and even less of them are tankies. This comes down to the fact that Bernie does not support them. 


When confronted on the topic Bernie stated.

>“Is it your assumption that I believed in authoritarian communism that was in the Soviet Union? I haven’t, and I opposed it,” Sanders said. “I happen to believe that in the United States, there is something fundamentally wrong when we have three families owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society.”


It goes without saying that Project Veritas is not a journalistic organization, one look at their videos on Kyle Jurek makes that clear even ignoring their well-documented history of muckraking and hoaxes. Jurek will be dealt with internally. Bad hires are inevitable and a radical anomaly does not define us. To judge a movement by its worst members is the foundation of ignorant stereotypes. There is no call to violence among Bernie supporters. If Bernie does not get the nomination no one will be rioting."

You're exceptionally ignorant if you think [Bernie isn't a viable candidate.](https://truthout.org/articles/sanders-leads-democrats-in-new-national-poll/) It's embarrassing that you don't even bother being superficially aware of what's going on like some kind of troglodyte.

Also, if you think one lunatic staffer speaks for millions of Bernie's constituents then you are either a huge hypocrite or woefully misinformed by right-leaning news sources.

• What treatment method are we using, and is it too early to try a different approach?

• Is there anything I can do to increase the efficacy of therapy?

• Could medication help? What about lifestyle changes?
