trees,fflzem0,t1_ffkoomm,1580046118.0,Yup we are tied with Missouri I think.
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,ffjdtoo,t1_ffjcj2x,1579996175.0,How about his multiple rants on trans people. Supporting Alex Jones and repeatedly saying the N word on his platform. I don’t have time to put up sources right now but all you need to do is browse who he has had on to know he is no good.
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,ffj9gom,t3_etxpz7,1579993568.0,Yeah that was a bad bad move by Bernie. Now any transgendered person is gonna see how Sanders is no longer loyal to them. Joes rhetoric is less than ok
WeatherGifs,ffeezaj,t3_eszfzn,1579845491.0,Those are the bendiest trees I’ve ever seen
politics,ffakkwv,t1_ffajkqx,1579738065.0,"I’m not buying it, she seems insincere, she lies. No go for me. Now if it’s between her and trump then I’ll gladly support her, but as long as I have Bernie, Warren is a no go."
politics,ffajh7o,t1_ffag48t,1579737259.0,But instead of admitting she was wrong she doubled down. I’m sorry but she lost all of my respect. Just proves she’s a liar like everyone else. I’ll also add pretending you are a minority is a lot different than thinking oh I’m Italian when you actually aren’t. Native Americans are the most oppressed people in America and what do you know some rich white lady is sitting here pretending she is one of them.
politics,ffafept,t1_ff9wfpw,1579734462.0,Her lies about her heritage is exactly why I’m not voting for her. Yeah that’s a big problem she will have to overcome.
NationalPark,ff895r6,t3_es2bk2,1579669667.0,Looks like the pine beetle is in the valley. That’s always a bummer to see.
geology,ff7o48e,t1_ff7fwox,1579654217.0,That makes more since. But what explains the relatively homogeneous Amazon rainforest having such extraordinary biodiversity in plants and insects. These are the species I’m talking about. It would seem that higher temperatures and lots of isolated landmasses would raise diversity levels.
geology,ff7ehu1,t1_ff6nu2s,1579647688.0,"Serious question, how could we tell if biodiversity was lower when fossils only formed under very specific circumstances. couldn’t their of been huge amounts of species we don’t know about? Especially when you get away from megafauna?"
politics,ff7aesc,t1_ff6xr5p,1579644580.0,Replace the word Hillary with trump and you sound identical to his supporters.

BlackPeopleTwitter,ff5iff1,t1_ff5dpe5,1579594323.0,"Well for one I’m sure guerrilla warfare will be extremely effective in a place like Appalachia. Lots of people are close to the land there, and they have lots of guns."
AskReddit,ff1doe7,t1_ff0iofb,1579477845.0,"Depends how much people make it too. 75 percent of America wouldn’t even know the first thing about hunting, There would be a lot a deaths I imagine the first year."

ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fenh4y9,t1_fenc9zx,1579284575.0,"Joe is spineless, I don’t think his views are that radical, but he gives a platform to people who absolutely don’t deserve it. Alex Jones and that Russian plant named Tulsi are a few. Even the comedians he has on are frequently super racist and sexist. Joe is extremely irresponsible at best."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fengsa1,t1_fempwc2,1579284358.0,Wow imagine trying this hard to defend white people lol.
technology,feng19e,t1_femf1iz,1579283897.0,Seems like something the alt right would say.
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fenewf1,t3_eq2cj4,1579283206.0,Here goes that dumb meathead joe again. God I wish YouTube had the balls to shut him down. He’s indoctrinated so many people I knew into the alt right. He’s seriously a danger to our democracy at the moment.

politics,fel0v2c,t1_fekzg6y,1579211649.0,"Most of his guest of importance are right wing. Other than a few exceptions. And even non political guest especially the comedians are just nasty human beings. They mock anyone who’s not up to their standards relentlessly. MMA guest are meatheads who encourage  toxic masculinity, and hunters, which I shouldn’t even have to explain why that’s wrong to promote. I believe I’ve said enough"
politics,fekynk0,t1_fekyfzm,1579210329.0,That’s 7 million potentially new republicans. If you don’t see a problem in that then I’m done talking to.
politics,fekxbfc,t1_fekwedd,1579209531.0,"I didn’t say Rogan was the only source, but oftentimes he is the bridge between someone sane and alt right. I’ve known a few people who started out normal and slowly succumbed to the disease of alt right all because joe and his posse indoctrinated them. Don’t believe me just browse through the subreddit, filled with absolutely garbage people. I rest my case"
politics,fekw59q,t1_fekvyr9,1579208838.0,"I mean he’s not far off from the truth, why wouldn’t you shame republicans."
politics,fekv4uz,t1_fekupr9,1579208236.0,"Its because easily influenced young get “red-pilled” for his guest like you said Alex Jones among countless others. Need more how bout Milo Yiannopoulus. Stefan Molybeaux. I could go on and on. Also Tulsi, seriously, the Russian plant pro Assad Tulsi. Rogan has immense influence, and so far he is using it to fuel white nationalism and other far right ideas. I don’t know about you but having Bernie on once and Jorda. Peterson on like at least 5 times doesn’t make up for it. Joe should have his platform removed."
politics,fektbp5,t1_feksco4,1579207172.0,"Fucking hell, it’s time to ban that sub, joe Rogan has created such a toxic environment! I bet thousands of young men have been indoctrinated into the alt right because of him and his disgusting guests."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fekmldo,t1_fejz56o,1579203186.0,Farm raised for sure. Deer racks will never ever get this large naturally
NatureIsFuckingLit,fekkzb2,t1_fejx8k9,1579202225.0,Well that’s the whole point of this deer. He was bred to have hideously large antlers so trophy hunters can drive up to him and shoot him. World record my ass a wild deer would never have antlers this large
Showerthoughts,feexq3p,t1_fee0w11,1579043504.0,This is generally not good advice. Birds eat many berries that’ll make us sick. Birds eat poison ivy berries for example. See how well that’ll work out for you.
AskReddit,fecxhzd,t1_fecrfx2,1578988602.0,Not to mention you can basically choke on any object. I can see someone dying from a fern leaf down the throat.
worldnews,fect915,t1_fecnkns,1578983723.0,Maybe it’s real or maybe not. Problem is you can never tell these days
whatsthisplant,fdvrmje,t1_fdue1tm,1578750744.0,Yes this plant doesn’t look like anything I know of in the lower 48. I agree we need someone who knows Mexican flora.
whatsthisplant,fdticix,t1_fdstsbs,1578717177.0,Hickory don’t grow that far south. Sinaloa would be the tropics

worldnews,fdsijxs,t1_fds7sq7,1578703417.0,"Preexisting fires are technically the reason for most new fires. Australian fires were caused either in accident, by arson, or by dry lightning. Once those fires get established embers will carry and start new fires compounding the situation"
worldnews,fdrhs1f,t3_emu1eo,1578684620.0,Well arson is to blame. But climate change made those fires a hundred times worse

worldnews,fdnnit4,t1_fdnm8r7,1578589479.0,"I wouldn’t doubt for a second Thylacine are still around in small numbers. Especially on the extremely remote island of New Guinea. I’ve never heard of the woodpecker, I’ll be looking into that."
worldnews,fdnmepm,t1_fdnm6o0,1578588829.0,Yeah that’s true but on the same hand knowing something is indeed still living is the first step to recovery. Yes their will be genetic issues but it’s all we got. I am unaware of this species range but animals don’t exactly walk up to us. It’s possible their numbers are higher than we think.
worldnews,fdnl71p,t1_fdnkw29,1578588117.0,"Yeah it’s truly a shame. But at the same time it might be worth in a couple of years for researchers to talk to the locals and see. Oftentimes they know more about a particular area than researchers. There are only so much scientists combing through the river.

worldnews,fdhbtgi,t1_fdhajgb,1578419578.0,"You could but humans have been in Australia for a hell of a lot longer than camels have. Also I should add humans have intellect, we can if we have our priorities straight manage wildlife appropriately. Tho includes family planning so less resources are used on our part. Regardless camels have to go for a healthy Australian ecosystem."
worldnews,fdhaor7,t1_fdh5znh,1578418979.0,It might seem that way until you realize camels are an invasive species in Australia. So culling then off will actually benefit native Australian animals. I consider it a win.
worldnews,fdh9h22,t1_fdguqjw,1578418270.0,Camels are invasive species. Humans are not. The whole environment will be better off without them
