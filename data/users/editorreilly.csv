But for insulation I own a couple of CRO, and UGQ quilts, which might be cheaper. But I don't think you could go wrong with the wookie.  If your looking to save weight for backpacking, that setup won't be the lightest out there, but if your car camping, that's pretty much the most deluxe you can get."

LosAngeles,fehn2nv,t3_ep64xf,1579119878.0,"Reality TV editor here:  Office culture in Hollywood can be absolutely horrific.  We all joke about having Human Resources because there literally is no HR in Hollywood except at the big studios.  Producers scream, belittle, sexually harass employees; all under the guise that this business is a creative one and rules like that don't stifle the process.  Sometimes the culture gets very toxic.  Some networks, and/or studios are worse than others.  But this industry is NOT family friendly, it requires long hours in intense environments.  I can see why Hollywood is so full of suicide."

AskReddit,feeyg6w,t3_eojio7,1579043974.0,"I was the Supervising Editor on a hit Reality TV show where the audience is primarily women and gay men.  One of the executive producers (gay male) came into the office and wanted to meet me to congratulate me and my team on a great season.   (I'm a very straight middle aged white Dad - and I look the part)  When he was introduced to me, he gave me a look down and said to me in a condescending tone -  ""You're the Supervising editor?""  And proceeded to belittle me the rest of the meeting.  He apparently thought I would have been gay to hold that position.  The gay mafia does exist."
CampingGear,feeuxrd,t3_eolbyq,1579041759.0,"I made one, and it's ungodly heavy; extremely sturdy though.   I ended up buying a rolling cart so that I could store it on my garage, then wheel it to the bed of my truck.  It's a great thing to have for organization, but I would be thinking about how to cut weight before I even started.  If I were to remake it, I'd be thinking about maybe making it out of Aluminium sheeting, or even find a way to make it out of thick plastic like vinyl siding, etc.  With all that said, they are really great, and I always have a surface to prep food with."

hammockcamping,fe6m0qp,t1_fe5t6f5,1578895452.0,"For quilts go with Cedar Ridge Outdoors, or UGQ.  There are other great cottage vendors, but these are the ones I know are great.  I own several quilts.  For the hammock I use a Warbonnet Traveler XL.  But I like a bare bones Hammock.  The Blackbird is the Cadillac, but relatively heavy.  A buddy of mine has the Dutchware Chameleon and loves it.  For a tarp I have the Warbonnet Mambajamba.   Once I again I like more of a minimalist tarp.  But my buddy likes the WB Superfly.  That thing is like a tent. Then there's the high dollar DCF tarps.  Super light, but super expensive.  I use an UQ protector for 3 season, and for winter, I have the Dutchware winter sock. It gives me more protection from the cold. I hardly use a bugnet since I'm in Southern California.  I'm more of a knot guy and tend to stay away from the fancy Dutchware bling.  But lots of people like the hardware for setup.  It's just a preference.  But I like modularity over the fancy, all in one setups.  But neither route is wrong. Just advantages vs. disadvantages.  It's all about how you like to hang.  There is no one size fits all.  And I doubt you'll get exactly what you want first time out.  I'd keep cruising these forums, see what everyone is talking about, watch gear reviews and see what people are using, then get it there and start hanging!! The hammock community is a great place, and lots of people are always willing to help out."

Look at the protests during the Vietnam war for example.  It's not the old people that are the problem it's the people with all the money trying to protect their cash.  As soon as we all figure out that it wasn't the other generations fault, and realize it's the power elite, the quicker we can solve these problems.  Hopefully your generation can figure it out."
todayilearned,fe383y9,t3_enmk0y,1578846872.0,"Sad thing is, that I'd be willing to bet that the producers had the money, they just wanted to line their pockets with it.  Keanu being the nice guy probably got taken advantage of.  Hollywood producers are some of the slimiest people in the world."

Basically a plastic bag.  One foot in the plastic bag, with a thin silk sock, and the other in my heavy wool sock.   My foot in the plastic bag was much warmer.
