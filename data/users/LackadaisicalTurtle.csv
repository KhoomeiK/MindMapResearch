The government doesn’t automatically  owe them kickbacks just because they chose to die on that hill, they’re lucky they even get that much."

Antibiotics lose effectiveness on bacteria and oh look! by extension lose effectiveness on treatment in the body of the host. See how I just made that up and it isn’t well documented at this point? Stop peddling info that actually endangers people."
facepalm,fghd7t1,t1_fghbpvp,1580782233.0,No stop spreading this shit. Antibiotics are losing effectiveness because so many people think they need them for everything.

Actual heinous shit on both fronts and we’re worried about a phone call. The only reason this is a big deal is people don’t like Trump."
politics,fg8nvar,t1_fg8nliu,1580625910.0,The entire impeachment was a stunt. Trump is a piece of shit yet they brought forth a super weak argument to impeach him on knowing full well it wouldn’t stick. Idk if they’re going for optics or what but it’s not a good look when he gets acquitted.

Everyone knew exactly how the house and senate were gonna vote so I agree it was a waste of time but the political stunts were appalling on both sides.

It’s an Internet forum, people won’t magically stop being racist just because of whatever you say. Racists gonna be racists and literally my entire point was to not get worked up over it and let it go. You’re free to be as upset as you like but that’s gonna be a full time job man"
