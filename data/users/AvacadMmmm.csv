She passed before I got into the Beatles and it was only when I discovered them that it struck me that all those years as a kid she was refereeing to the drummer of the beatles, the greatest band ever. I never got to talk to her about them and honestly have no clue how much she like them, what her favorite songs were, etc and it just crushes me at times.

beatles,fff9d4g,t1_ffeenob,1579878931.0,"They had four songs (two singles, A side and B side) already recorded and ready to go for the album. Those were recorded on two separate days in the months prior as they started to become popular across England. So that’s why it says three days."
beatles,fff96u2,t1_ffeg2vr,1579878816.0,I’ve always felt those  two albums are actually overrated contrary to popular opinion. If Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane we’re kept on Pepper as planned then I’d say it’s one of their best if not the best. Abbey road took several old throwaways to create the medley and again contrary to popular opinion I think it’s just ok. My opinion is their best recorded work was the White Album. The issue with it though is they had so many songs after coming back from India and they made a double album with a handful of throwaways. If they reduced that album to a 14 track Standard LP it would have been the best album they made. The double is still great but most people would agree there are some not so great songs on there.

It’s incredible they wrote all those great songs and recorded them so fast. Even crazier is Lennon wrote the majority of them.
