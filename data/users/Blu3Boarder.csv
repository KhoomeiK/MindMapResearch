Sushi Go! Party, Skull, The Resistance, and Incan Gold (A light press-your-luck game, but loads of fun!).

I wasn’t a big fan of Murder in Hong Kong because the non-criminal players have to pay attention to so many details to find out the murderers. I think The Resistance, Bang! The Dice Game and Secret Hitler are better hidden role games. As for Catan, I agree with other commenters that 5-6 players is suboptimal and has too much downtime. I personally love Scythe, but it is a VERY heavy game; I would consider gauging the interest of your group with a more medium weight game before pulling out Scythe. I would also put Viticulture in the same boat as Scythe."

socialanxiety,fdlhst6,t3_elyymh,1578524315.0,"I recommend trying a sport like cup-in-hand kickball that is non-competitive and silly by nature, or joining a pick-up/social sports league where the emphasis is on meeting people rather than competition. People who do those things are just there to socialize and have a good time, and no one cares if you drop the ball. I’ve done it a couple times, both with people I knew well and people I didn’t, and have had a blast. The anxiety is a pain to deal with at first, but definitely worth pushing through; I looked forward to the games each week despite that. 

I even did volleyball leagues where people were definitely more skilled than me, and no one really cared that much. In fact, they really praised my growth by the end of the season. No one will yell at you or insult you. I promise."

socialanxiety,fdl6bf0,t3_elxw74,1578517784.0,"The best way I’ve dealt with my social phobia is through gradual exposure. No need to become the life of the party right of the way (or ever); you just need to put yourself in a situation that makes you moderately uncomfortable until you’re comfortable, then move up to the next hardest situation. Avoid putting pressure on yourself to be at the level you perceive everyone else to be because it is not helpful. I have wasted far too much time because of this.

Try reading a book in a coffee shop or restaurant to start just to get comfortable being around people, and later you can ask baristas or cashiers how their day is going. They usually appreciate it, and they have to be nice to you because it’s their job :). 

If you want some more advanced exposure therapy, I recommend speed dating.

It may also be worth talking to a psychiatrist to see if medication can help with your symptoms.  Medication can be helpful in taking the edge off, which will help you to function and face your fears.

I hope this helps!"
