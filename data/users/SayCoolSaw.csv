French,fc69prj,t1_fc59ken,1577475512.0,"The equivalent to ""as a swede"" would be ""as a frenchman"". And the equivalent to ""as a french person"" would be ""as a swedish person""."
French,fc69m80,t3_eg6ti8,1577475448.0,"Speaking french with the incorrect genders (or defaulting to one gender all the time) would be like a french speaker saying things like ""He am happy today"" or ""They has big enjoyment"". You would know what they are trying to say, but it will sound bizarre and broken. It really is worth the effort to include it in what you're learning, even though it can be frustrating and feel unnecessary."
French,fc69491,t3_egf952,1577475118.0,"There really is no trick. You just have to keep using it and eventually your brain just learns what sounds correct and incorrect. 

I guess one thing I will say (and I suppose you could think of this as a ""trick"") is to try and not think about french in terms of English whenever possible. When you first start out, it can be helpful to think in terms of English and then work out how to programmatically convert that to French. But once you've learned most of the basics, this kind of approach starts to be much more of a hinderance than a help. 

All languages have things that are just plain different than how English does things. The subject-object-verb order in French is one of those. Even things as simple as the present tense (i.e. english always using the progressive form ""I am walking"" and most other languages using a simple present ""je marche"") is pretty significantly different. Presumably you are pretty comfortable using present tense in french and it doesn't feel odd to write ""je mange"" for ""i am eating"". Eventually, je t'aime or je le déteste will just start to sound like the correct way to say something in french. Until then, you just have to force yourself to try and use it."

\> *Merrick Garland would like to know your location*

I'm aware of how Merrick Garland fits into the concept of elections having consequences. I'm asking what the ""would like to know your location"" part is supposed to be. What exactly is being said about the Merrick Garland/Obama SCOTUS pick that comes from the thing about knowing my location? 

I suspect that the person who said it didn't know what they meant and even now, nobody knows what the hell this ""joke"" is supposed to be saying. Basically the name Merrick Garland showed up and so you sort of know that some kind of joke referencing that was made but you don't actually know what specifically is being said here. And yet you're all pretending like I'm the weird one for asking what the hell that means."
politics,fc1fm6j,t1_fc1figb,1577317314.0,That doesn't explain anything. I'm already aware of the Merrick Garland situation and why it was the thing being referenced. I'm asking about the specific phrasing of the joke and how this works as a joke.
