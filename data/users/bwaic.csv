Like carbon emissions and climate change and environmental impacts. Maybe you’ll see how these grow with human population growth. Maybe you’ll conclude these are just correlation. I’ll say it’s causation. Then we can begin to discuss what the remedy is."

todayilearned,ff6y3s6,t1_ff6qch8,1579637269.0,"The money is the same. I get that. Whether everyone pays as a license or a tax. I get that. But if it is a tax, pushing people to pay it as a license instead of through income tax is a roundabout way to get people to pay it indirectly so it doesn’t show up as a tax increase. So why pay it as a separate tax as a license when it should be paid as a tax? Would you rather pay your military defense separately too? And your healthcare? And your road repairs and weather bureau? And statistics office? Might as well, right?

I don’t know how much we pay for CBC. I could look it up, but it would be upsetting to have to pay it separately as some sort of game we have to play so it doesn’t show up as a tax increase."

Half the number of humans would give the rest of the planet even a chance to even survive, let alone a chance to hopefully recover. Not all disasters to the planet are only disasters if they affect our precious species. The world is getting wiped out in ways we don't care to measure until a scientist can either phrase it in terms of human deaths, or threat to human life. 

Maybe we don't have to look at the rest of the planet as just a reserve for our plundering. Any human increase begets more human increase. It is an excuse to kick the can down the street for another generation to deal with."
