SuicideWatch,fg8br6e,t1_fg8bhbi,1580614910.0,"They won't get better cause we've been down this road before, last time ti lead to 4 months if no contact at all on my decision. If he has to choose he will choose her cause she has his kid and I know he'll choose cause I see the look in his eyes, he's tired of fighting all the time and honestly so am I. I ain't never needed no one, from day one it's just been me and I'm straight with that. Just nice to have people to talk to about shit"

I'm just so tired of being the punching bag because regardless of if I had anything to do with it or not, itll come back on me. I'm at the point where I want to cut her off but I can't do that without cutting him off too cause they're always together social an endless loop"

    My path is mine and mine alone,
    From high on that cold mountain,
    I hear those ancient winds moan,
    No place I shall call home,
    

    From high up on icy mountain,
    I howl my melancholy question,
    And ponder my response,
    To which I fear more,
    The answer or the return,


    I shan't ever feel the warmth of love, 
    For I am cold and lonely,
    Though my will remains unbroken,
    My faith lay shattered in pieces,
    On that warm July day,
    When my love left me,
    With a cold chill I couldn't shake,
    On such a pleasant day,


    These seizures and pains lay my
    body broken and shattered, 
    If only I had a token of hope,
    Maybe I wouldn't have laid me
    down to rest,
    In the lands of the hereafter,
    With all those who came before me,
    As I'd lay here drawing nearer to thee,
    My final breath nearing me,
    My pack that I abandoned comes to me,
    And takes me home,


    From high on lonely mountain,
    I howl my melancholy question,
    And know my answer,
    Of which I fear more,
    I dread the return,
    As I walk down my icy path,
    I look to my left then my right,
    And see that I am walking forever alone,
    For the path of the lone wolf,
    Is mine and mine alone"

dontputyourdickinthat,ff19qdr,t1_fezs130,1579476610.0,"You wanna know something terrifying? Let's say you meet a girl for a date and she starts giving you some tongue action while making out with you. What if she too always licks toilets? There's no way you would ever know beforehand unless you asked. And let's be real here, is that really something you want to ask on a first date and run the high risk of her walking away?"

depression,fcjnrj1,t1_fcjdj0q,1577695624.0,"Me too, I'll just say my doctor said I may have brain cancer, and secretly I've been hoping and praying I do, just so i can be done with the misery I've lived in for the past nearly 14 years. I'm kinda scared of dying, but i know I'll go to Heaven so that comforts me. I deserve the pain of a slow death anyways, all the shit I've done. I'm tired man, the kind of tired you can't sleep off. Everyday i wake up I drag myself out of bed, sometimes throw up or nearly throw up, put on my fake smile and walk my weary ass through the day, then barely make it to my bed before my body gives out and pass out just to do it again, day in and day out. On top of that, seizures have plagued me, and I'm losing control of my body, falling and shit, dropping things. No one knows how bad it's gotten and how worse it'll get, my 2 best friends and my mom know parts of it. I'm just too weak to fight this losing war anymore guys. I've already decided I don't want treatment, I don't wanna prolong the inevitable. Chances of me making it outta this alive, slim to none, less then 20%. So I've been trying to hang out with my best friends as much as I can, and my mom and dog before I'm too weak to. Idk why I said this much, I guess I just needed to vent, even to internet strangers. Anyways, thanks for listening I guess."
