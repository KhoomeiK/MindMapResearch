IdiotsNearlyDying,ffhldre,t1_fekf0yr,1579940749.0,There's a lot more fd up stuff going on in China than most people realize.
IdiotsNearlyDying,ffhlaej,t3_ep99x4,1579940611.0,That's a story she'll be telling for the rest of her life.
IdiotsNearlyDying,ffhl55b,t3_et9ch0,1579940399.0,I bet his mom loves this.
sanmarcos,fdpv4vo,t3_emjxcz,1578641757.0,Did you find it?
Humanoidencounters,fdkn735,t1_fdkji0i,1578507062.0,I'll think about it. Mainly I could really relate to that feeling of truly not being able to process of comprehend what is happening. It's the feeling or reality being torn apart and being terrified at the same time.
Humanoidencounters,fdkmlbv,t1_fdkf417,1578506687.0,I might. I've never written it down before.
sanmarcos,fdk67kv,t3_elqll2,1578496995.0,Garcias.
Humanoidencounters,fdjfyv8,t3_eljuij,1578469145.0,"I can absolutely relate to your feeling of not being able to process it what you just experienced, being terrified, and being in a state of shock.  The reaction you describe reminds me of the main paranormal experience I have had in my life when I was much younger.  I just remember locking the door and moving things in front of the door to barricade it, and going down to the ground praying that God would erase my memory of what I just saw because more than anything didn't want it to be real and didn't want to carry the memory of it with me for the rest of my life.  I've only shared what happened to a few people but it changed my life.  Had I not experienced it then knowing my personality I probably would not believe in anything supernatural, nor would I be on this sub right now."
Gangstalking,fd3oypl,t1_fd3ole0,1578160444.0,I don't know why he did that but except to post this as an example of how it would work. So you just assumed the guy was racist without knowing it for sure? That's not a good thing for society if so. Or do you have evidence?
Gangstalking,fd3nbgm,t1_fd3l5xv,1578159938.0,Do you have anything other than him being an overzealous gun nut? Lots of being falsely being accused of racism these days.
Gangstalking,fd3lhrx,t1_fd3l5xv,1578159462.0,It just says he's an open carry activist.
Gangstalking,fd3l34f,t1_fd3kelc,1578159320.0,Where's the evidence that's he's associated with a white power militia? I'm not seeing it when I search for him.
Gangstalking,fd3k8y3,t1_fd3jhgy,1578159055.0,The YouTube link posted on reddit? I can click on that here. Unless it's another link or something else I don't see where white supremacy comes into play here.
Gangstalking,fd3iq6i,t1_fd2e1c7,1578158703.0,How do you know that's the case?
exredpill,fczcgne,t1_fczcfcc,1578098140.0,Totally agree.
exredpill,fczbmd2,t1_fcx6tow,1578097647.0,I don't understand what point you are trying to get across.
OpenChristian,fcx0z6l,t3_ej83gw,1578046346.0,"Yes that is unhealthy and what you did was wrong sinful. It would be natural and ok to feel ashamed of this.  Some shame is healthy and this would be one of those instances. I think you knew it was wrong before you posted this, but were hoping to rationalize it because you enjoyed the temporary pleasure.  You gotta own up to this one and seek repentance."
Gangstalking,fcwzbtj,t3_ejc7xp,1578044182.0,This is the first thing I've seen that makes me see how some of this stuff could be real.
Apocalypse,fcwzajw,t1_fctw4qg,1578044134.0,I knew this would be the top comment when I clicked the thread.
timetravel,fcwyw5i,t1_fcwcx01,1578043608.0,He might have been trippin on something then.
timetravel,fcwyuns,t3_ej5t2x,1578043553.0,And he wasn't calling the place Time Traveler Coffee?
Reincarnation,fcwyr1n,t3_ej9jq4,1578043421.0,"Well sure but, don't you want to play as a dolphin at least once?  It's got its upsides."
DHMIS,fcwynik,t3_eiyfju,1578043294.0,"Have you ever wondered why we're here.
What's it all about, you've no idea."
mysteriesoftheworld,fcwyfeq,t3_ej3063,1578043010.0,"You probably encountered a projectile from a bagel cannon, you are supposed to catch them.  Did they at least shoot you some cream cheese?"
exredpill,fcwwfvf,t3_ei63eu,1578040503.0,What happened to the detox sticky that used to be on here?  There was some good info in it and it's what pulled me out of my funk a while back.
exredpill,fcww76u,t3_ehqe90,1578040198.0,"True.  I'm a guy and I can say for myself that once I get about 10 messages from people I don't know I get kinda tired of following up on all of them unless there's something about one that really seems interesting.  Can you imagine getting 100+ emails a day from strangers?  I really can't blame women for not responding to most, and just like guy's, there going to be looking for men they are more attracted to.  That's not anything unique or proving a hypergamous theory. That's common sense and us guys are doing this too.  A lot of it is just logistics of the situation.  It does suck if you don't know how to meet women outside of the apps though, I can see how that would create the false impression that there's no hope.... which is the bitterness that RP preys upon."
exredpill,fcwvjka,t3_eiga03,1578039395.0,"I'm not defending the PUA concept, but to be fair there are some that basically just teach you to introduce yourself and have decent conversation skills and don't claim it works on everyone.  I think that's a very healthy thing to learn and I can say it helped me, and not only does it work, it's the only thing that really works.  Where it can get weird is all of the artificial rules and techniques to attract her.  Once you learn true self respect, it's really just a matter of being real and seeing if there's a match.  Admittedly, the non-manipulative techniques still aren't bad to know in some situations and can spark attraction, and you don't want to be so afraid to make a move that you never do it, which a lot of the dating advice teaches, but it really just depends on the personality you're with.  There's definitely some shady stuff in pickup, but there's also some good advice that gives men the training wheels they need to have basic human interactions which can lead to something."
Foodforthought,fcqg0cg,t1_fcowsep,1577885306.0,"I'm not pro GOP, I just don't agree with what the liberal political think tanks tell me I should believe. I'm an independent not a democrat."
Foodforthought,fcow6zm,t1_fcovjh7,1577843248.0,"Lol No, I have better things to do on NYE than talk to you. Go away Bubba."
Foodforthought,fcout1u,t1_fcou57u,1577842152.0,"I could but you're going to believe whatever you're already convinced of. Even if I explain the situation to you, you aren't going to change your mind. So, I'm not wasting my time."
Foodforthought,fcoqvoh,t1_fcoq60c,1577839135.0,"Yeah, people aren't well educated on civics now. I think a lot of the online narcissist behavior comes from alienation. When I get into debates on here I feel like I'm arguing with really young people, and I probably am. This sub used to be a lot cooler a few years ago but I just unsubscribed. I'll let the people here worry and agree with one another about the coming tyrannical authoritarian theocracy in peace."
Foodforthought,fcopl7r,t3_ei3od4,1577838195.0,"There's not going to be a theocratic authoritarian state take over, just like Obama was never going to bring about a communist if dictatorship. It's silly. I'm more interested in figuring out shit like how to improve economic mobility, fix entitlement problems, balance trade, stopping excessive foreign real estate investment, insurance, taxes. That's what I vote over, and I know most working class adults in the real world don't believe in extreme ideas on either side.  This is why independents are always the voting block that decides the results of major elections. People need to chill."

Foodforthought,fco3jw7,t1_fco2pbu,1577823408.0,Couldn't agree with you more.
FinalFantasyVI,fco1mm7,t1_fcnrdem,1577822445.0,Welcome! That was always one of my favorite songs from the game.
Foodforthought,fco1cld,t1_fcnux2e,1577822304.0,"Fear mongering is pushing the perception of threats on the public for political gain while acknowledging actual threats requires clearer thinking which understands the actual point of view of both sides first instead of just demonizing it. Both sides do this because it works, emotional thinking works and galvanizes people. I'm not going to explain the actual political situation going on though, there's information available out there which you can seek out."

One of the biggest things that helped me was learning about complex trauma and how it can create isolation and self loathing. I've got a handle on it now and can recognize the false discouraging thoughts in my mind now, but I still wish I took more action because I know for certain that this is the only thing keeping me from finding what I want."
