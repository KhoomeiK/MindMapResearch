aww,ffzpdsi,t1_ffza1dk,1580388892.0,As a woman I've never heard that. I do leave some of my husky's hair outside after a good brushing. The birds and squirrels do use it for their nests.

BeAmazed,ffwqdt0,t1_ffw9pv3,1580308461.0,"I got this as a kid living in Arizona in the early 90s. I don't remember much, but my mom always says I was sick for like 2 months, and it was terrible."
TrueCrimeDiscussion,ffwoswx,t1_ffvf9ym,1580307311.0,And exactly how is she an unfit guardian? I didn't read anything regarding that informaron. Are you apart of this case? Seems like you've got some inside informaron on this.
Damnthatsinteresting,ffwnauv,t1_ffwioz6,1580306166.0,"I have very curly hair, and when I was really poor this stuff was the only shampoo and conditioner that didn't make me look like a fuzzball.

P.s. Still dirt poor. Just a little less so now."
aww,ffu8pqb,t1_ffu7f7v,1580236839.0,"Holy shit. I need to go back and check out all the links later, but that's terrifying. I really want to know why people are still using it, and why it hasn't been banned. I imagine people with security clearances are using this seeing how popular it is. These videos are everywhere."

relationship_advice,ffjs9lb,t1_ffjkgp1,1580005567.0,"Oh no, I did. You sound pompous, and like someone who has never experienced something like this. Yes let's encourage the minor to give someone, who ignored her boundaries and caused physical and mental harm, one more chance. Then if he does it again (which he has basically already proved he will do it again, since she tried to tell him he hurt her and he ignored her. Which if you had actually read the post she explained that) she should leave him. Oh and good luck! 

If you had a daughter and this happened to her, would you tell her to give that boy one more chance? ""He didn't know honey, just tell him so next time he remembers. I know it can be intimidating, but he should get it"". You actually just proved what a ludicrously evil person you are."

A young girl has just experienced trauma from someone she thought had her best interests at heart, and you want to be sarcastic? It looks like you're into bjj. So when you tap, you think it's ok for someone to keep going? I would hate to be on a mat or in bed with you."
cookiedecorating,ffhc7ig,t3_etkh2b,1579929565.0,Try a bit thicker consistency icing. Also after you mix your icing let it sit for about 15 mins to let all the air bubbles come to the top so you can pop them. It will help your cookie's finished product. Good luck!

trashy,ff2r54l,t3_er6rgd,1579520360.0,"I used to work as a barista for a donut and coffee chain that is popular in 4 or 5 startes in the Midwest. We were popular with the elderly and highschoolers since we were sandwiched in between a HS and a senior center. It only every happened in the mens, and it was always an elderly man. Shit on the floor, smeared on the wall, upper deckers, behind the toilet. It was disgusting, and it was the same man. The manager was a piece of shit so never said anything to the him because he was a regular. Just sent someone to clean it.

kratom,fejvljo,t3_epg2xl,1579186867.0,It all depends on where your CBD came from. Where you purchased it do they have COA or lab results? That will break down exactly what is in it. If the amount of THC is below .3% you should be fine.
antiMLM,feiluim,t3_epbt9o,1579141558.0,"What an absolute piece of garbage. I cannot even put my head into any type space where this would be acceptable. I agree with the other person that said to send her all the comments. I also suggest shaming her on Facebook, where you can use her real name. Show everyone what her ""small business"" is really about. 

Also I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm sending you all the healing energy."
aww,fehsffo,t3_ep6hsq,1579122954.0,Sweet baby puff ball. You should put him back though. Momma rabbits leave their kits alone for periods of time during the day. She will be looking for her little one.
