AskReddit,fep43xc,t3_eq1wzh,1579311695.0,"Selfish to say as it may be, get rid of my student debt. I'll find the job, I'll marry the girl, but man did I screw up there. She is a saint for not letting it be a deal breaker, lol."
getdisciplined,fec4pvr,t3_eo5h83,1578966618.0,"Start small, always. Lots of folk on this sub are proponents of the Pomodoro (feels like I misspell that every time I type it) technique. Work for a set period of time, take a break for a (smaller) set period of time. That's a rough explanation, wouldn't hurt to do some Googlin' yourself. 

You won't find a magic switch to become instantly disciplined. Another comment said to build tiny, daily habits and that's about right. Check out that sub they mentioned, and I would recommend the *Discipline Equals Freedom Field Manual* by Jocko Willink. 

Good luck!"
freefolk,fe5lpvz,t3_enodev,1578871007.0,"Also... and I know this has been discussed before to nauseating lengths, but they had Aegon *fucking* Targaryen in all this mix and he didn't even get to kill the god damn living embodiment of winter. 

Every time I see this sub I am reminded of how much better it could have been, and how much better I hope the final book will be (if it comes out prior to the heat death of the universe)."
AskReddit,fe5keiy,t3_ennslu,1578870525.0,"1. Understand that, more often then not, you are not as trapped as you seem to think you are. If you don't like some aspect of your life (work, friends, physical/mental health), you shouldn't sit and despair. Make a plan and correct that plan as you go. 

2. You're going to need to ask for help a lot, and your life will be unimaginably more difficult if you don't.

3. You will never learn enough. That doesn't mean stop trying to learn, it means *constantly* pursue knowledge it a way that keeps you engaged but also improves you."
getdisciplined,fdlg5cu,t1_fdfqj3e,1578523302.0,"I am so sorry for this taking so long! Honestly, you could just carry a little note pad around and write stuff as you go. I used to do that a lot. Also, it doesn't hurt to plan things out the night before. Major things, that is. That way you go into the day with a game plan in mind and can tackle things as they come, according to severity."
getdisciplined,fdfheip,t3_el1cn6,1578361749.0,"I learned through this subreddit something called ""The Pomodoro technique,"" which I think you might want to consider. Most people can't sit down and do 2+ hours of work at a time. But 2 hours split into 25 minutes intervals, with breaks? Can be very useful.

Having a reward at the end of doing some work might get your brain to gamify your work and really dial in. Check it out and see if it works for you!"
JockoPodcast,fdar6wg,t3_ek6bc1,1578249179.0,I have a copy of Meditations sitting on my night stand. Think it might be next on the list after The Pentagon's Brain.

getdisciplined,fcv9vhz,t3_ej0lh0,1577997668.0,"Yes, but it's always safe to remind people a couple things:

1. Discipline is a never ending challenge. You will never *be there*, you will reach goals and find yourself needing new challenges. Complacency in where you are in your discipline journey will take you off the path and start you right back at the beginning.

2. Don't compare your journey to self-discipline to someone else's. Not everyone is a Jocko Willink and can just *wake up at 4 in the fuckin' morning* (though damn, I'm working on it lol). Start small, and start slowly. If you start big and fast you will fail at a faster rate than when you start small and slow, and it will be a bigger, more demoralizing failure than if you just have a wee goal in mind to better yourself.

3. Read. ReAD. *READ*. As Jim ""Warrior Monk"" Mattis is want to say, ""there is nothing new under the sun."" You aren't reaching your potential, and in fact are holding back your ability to improve by ignoring literary resources that are available to you. 

But man, once you start, you will notice it. You will fail no matter what, so don't let that hold ya' back from making concious efforts to get things under as much control as you can competently muster."

getdisciplined,fclwnff,t3_ehrqv0,1577758272.0,"1. *Extreme Ownership* by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin.
2. *Make Your Bed* by William McRaven.
3. Keep an eye on what your eat. Don't have to go on a super crazy, strict diet. Consider using an app like MyFitnessPal (what I use) and just taking a look at what you eat. It's one thing to say ""drink less soda and eat less shit,"" it is another thing to actually put it down on (digital) paper to look at.
4. Find some time before your day starts to get a workout in. I do it in the mornings, but obviously your schedule is will vary from mine. Find something you like, be it running or calisthenics or weight lifting, and stick to it."
getdisciplined,fchuihg,t3_egvllp,1577654292.0,"These aren't concrete but I've got a few, I think:

1. Save another $500 for my emergency fund.
2. Drop to 240 lbs (currently hovering at 265 and oof). 
3. Wake up consistently at 5:45 (would like to get to 5:30 but I am working slowly at it lol).
4. Continue to read at least a book a month. I make no bones about reading a slow reader, but it's been a good pace for me so far."
getdisciplined,fchs5ra,t3_eh2076,1577653570.0,"I have this same issue when it comes to the summer break between semesters. I think part of the answer lies in breaking down specifically *what* you want to improve/do with your free time. 

You said you have been working at practicing your guitar. Try and look at it from a similar perspective, setting goals on things you want to achieve similar to being dope on guitar. Maybe a fitness goal? ""Be able to do XX number of pushups in a row,"" or something similar. Once you have those goals set, whatever they may be, you have an ability to set your road map and structure you free days to be as productive as you want. And if you find that the map you initially set isn't working, adjust accordingly (same goes for if the goals don't end up being what you wanted!)

Hope this helps, good luck!"
getdisciplined,fchqz8e,t3_eh9vhi,1577653196.0,"You can never go wrong with more reading. This has been the year of nonfiction for me personally, but I definitely have nothing against fiction either! I just finished *Outlaw Platoon* by Sean Parnell, and it was a fantastic read if you are interested.

I am utter shit at it but maybe take up a skill based hobby like drawing? I got a cheap-o notebook from I think Walmart, just been doodling the world around me (first page is a doorway at my school, lol). Set a timer on it and say ""okay, 25 minutes of no internet and practicing X."" 

Also can never go wrong with exercise. Small 5x5 circuits of push ups, sit ups, squats, etc would keep you off the internet and get your blood flowin'. 

Hope this helps, good luck!"
getdisciplined,fcale41,t3_egwkuk,1577571532.0,"Couple thoughts spring to mind:

1. Gotta know why you are doing what you are doing. You'll never wake up early, workout, diet, or improve in general if you don't know why those things will improve you. When things get tough, and you need to lean on yourself, knowing the why helps a hell of a lot.

2. You need to make some things almost ritualistic in nature. When you wake up, you know what you are going to do. When you are getting ready for bed, you know what you are going to do. This doesn't mean map your life out to a T, but having some routines will make things easier in the long run when other elements of your life get chaotic.

3. Consistency is key, regardless of what circumstances might tell you otherwise. Is it your birthday? Go workout still. Rough day? Crank out a chunk of writing. Some mindless holiday people use an excuse to get sloshed and act like an ass? You can join them, or you can avoid the headache and not waste time like that. You've gotta start now, though. Because once you are on the path, it is easier to get done what needs getting done. But if you let yourself fall off the path (*""Well, it has been a while since I just fucked around...""*) it will be THAT much harder to get back on. 

Lastly, (4.) make sure you are starting small. Don't try to conquer all the mountains at once. If you're having trouble writing consistently, set a small daily goal such as ""write for 25 minutes every day,"" at least. Let that build up until it because almost muscle memory. Obviously, I don't know your due dates or any of that good stuff, so you might need to adjust accordingly. Hope this helps, good luck!"
getdisciplined,fc6803q,t3_eg8yba,1577474381.0,"Well, firstly you've gotta give yourself a reason to get up and go. Having some kind of routine to help you step into action should be a good start. A lot of people have trouble getting out of bed because they look at all the raw potential of the day (in not so many words, lol) and instead of tackling the various issues, get overwhelmed and retreat to their devices/vices. If you wake up, and know that you need to brush teeth/get a quick workout/make your bed, it is a good start and a way to spring board into a more productive day.

Set some goals for the day. They don't have to be insane, they don't need to take hours of time. Find some things you want to work at and make it a goal to practice/work on those things. If you expand that idea and make some overarching goals (goals that will take weeks/months to possibly achieve), you will know what you need to do for the days to come. 

Lastly, I see this a lot on this sub and it is always worth repeating: prep for the next day the night before. Lay out clothes, put your shoes near your bed, have your bag ready to rock before you are, maybe even have an idea of what you want to have for breakfast. (Make this a nightly routine and you'll be cookin' with gas, per my first point.)"
getdisciplined,fc3pz8j,t3_efwncg,1577395730.0,"A couple different thoughts:

1. Saw someone else recommend the pomodoro technique and I couldn't agree more. Don't try to crank out 4 straight hours of studying, do 4 hours with lots of breaks (and time to walk around/stretch!). The phone doesn't look quite so tempting when you have a concrete goal (*""just five more minutes!""*)

2. Its cliché, but consider when you get groggy doing some push ups or somethin' that will jolt your system. Gets the blood flowing, forces your attention off whatever you might have been fixated on in the fog of thought and get you back to work. 

3. I touched on this in 1, but break your study/work goals into concrete objectives. Don't ""study for your test."" Instead, say ""I'm going to study chapter X for 25 minutes, and take notes, etc. Then take a break. Then I'll study chapter Y..."" If success is an abstraction, failure still won't be."
