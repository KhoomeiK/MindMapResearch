AskReddit,ffiw6dq,t3_etouc5,1579984171.0,"Local police deputy who taught DARE for years and years. His son was the biggest drug dealer in the area, *everyone* went to him for drugs. He died of an overdose, but his family covered it up by saying he drowned kayaking. Everyone knows what happened, no one bothers to rub it in. Dude couldn't swim and wasn't interested in being outside long enough to smoke a cigarette, he wasn't about to be doing water sports ffs.


One of the biggest land developers/property owners in the area has pretty clear ties to the Mafia. It's talked about, but no one really cares."

aww,ffhu8ja,t1_ffh8fpd,1579954155.0,"This is one of those funny knowledge flexes that cracks me up. It's still a crow. If it was smaller and didn't have a white neck, it'd still be a crow. Or a raven. It's both. It's always both. The distinction between them exists only because we humans are flawed and *need* to name dissimilar looking animals different things. This is as arbitrary as correcting someone offering you a kleenx by telling them it's just a tissue. There is essentially only size that makes a difference between a crow and a raven. If I have a huge golden retriever and you have a smaller golden retriever, they're both the same damn dog.


I do love this flex though, it's right up there with the classic ""it's not a clip! it's a MAGAZINE!!!"" argument. At the end of the day you know what it is, so stop being a dick."

It's not just that moving that smoothly would require inhuman strength, notice how she's on her toes? yeah no, she'd need her heels to have a chance at this.

The actual resolution is wvga, so like 800x600 pixels or so. Its going to look like shit for anything other than.. basically this. Don't be fooled by these ads and think that they'll look like a cheap flatscreen, they're going to look like a toy monitor or something. That's totally fine for this application, or for other decorative use (projecting patterns and stuff on the wall for parties is fun) but don't expect to watch tv/movies/games on one, no matter how good the brightness is. You're still going to be spending in the 250-$300 range for something that looks passable as a tv."
gaming,fev9m6d,t1_feuxg3s,1579394791.0,"a lot of the mods allow you to essentially repeat the same quest over and over again, and those quests are usually like hoard mode dealios where the fun is getting higher scores/lasting longer/getting done faster.

There's also the adult mods, which some have visual novel like questlines, and people like that."

In seconds I can switch from target practice with a .22, to varmint/small predator hunting with .223, to deer with .300 blackout/6.5 grendel then take out some large game with 450 bushmaster/458 socom.

These are all examples of horses working long in modern times though, where we have a very high understanding of animal husbandry. 

The setting suggests that they do not. ""Put that mare down before we go for the dragon"" seems like enough of an indicator that these animals are meant for work, even if Geralt treats his with a lot of respect. Couple that with the highly dangerous job that Roach does on a regular basis in imperfect conditions (jumping horses requires a certain amount of work to the area, no?) and it would seem likely that these animals don't live to their fullest potential."

I didn't think the actress did a bad job, just that she didn't quite look the part. In the books and I think the game she mentioned getting burned and not being able to wear low cut clothing which implied to me that she previously enjoyed wearing it. Show Triss seemed fairly plain compared to the other sorceresses."

My aunt had several pitbulls over the years, and as a dog trainer she was as qualified as possible. They were all loveable goofballs, except for that time one of them snapped and killed the neighbors lab. And the other time one put my cousin in the hospital. These were happy healthy great dogs, that had never once shown any aggression towards anyone or any other dog. Until they did. I've been bit by my rescue terrier too.
