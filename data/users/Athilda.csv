Also, they probably don't see me as a real threat because they see cyclists more frequently than cyclists see them, kwim?

Damned things scare the piss out of me on the regular. I ride my bike on some deeply wooded trails. While I appreciate their right to be there, I wish they'd stop scaring me.

Most times at night, I see their eyes and I'll start making a lot of noise as I'm slowing down. Usually, they'll get out of the path and run into the brush. But sometimes, they stop and stare. That scares me a lot. I'll stop as far away as I can and and start rapping on my helmet and ringing my bell and that makes them leave but it's usually slowly. I'm always worried when I cross their path that they'll come charging out back at me.

But the worst is when I don't see them until I'm crossing in front of them. It makes my blood run cold every time. I'd be in a world of hurt if they ever decide to charge across and hit me."

Some computer security company did a study not too long ago regarding which sites are most likely to have malevelant links  and virus exposure.

Porn sites are by and large some of whew safest of all sites in that regard. They theorized that it was because these sites tend to be making money hand over fist and were willing to pay for top IT talent to ensure their sites were well maintained which in turn  ensures they could maintain a good reputation for their services.

The worst sites, by quite a large margin, were run by chuches. And it's pretty much because of the opposite situation. Churches tend to have amateur IT personnel, and are unwilling to spend money for proper safe guards."
