RBI,ffx23ze,t3_evoonb,1580316108.0,It could potentially be one of the many  online seller brands on amazon or ebay. I haven't found anything yet but that might be a direction to look
YouShouldKnow,ffvk4i4,t3_evbbhu,1580266002.0,"This sounds like the classic scheme where 'experts' buy up thinly traded stocks, artificially increasing their price, then advise their followers to buy, driving the price up further. They then sell, screwing over and profiting off of all of their followers. They're always packaged as learning tools or courses too.

degoogle,ffv7u32,t3_ev73sc,1580257753.0,"If you're still looking for feedback, I think one of the main things that keeps people in the google/microsoft ecosystem is the fact that they have the only two spreadsheet applications that are fully usable and have sufficient features to enable a speedy workflow."
YouShouldKnow,ff3gd35,t1_ff3fkaa,1579540479.0,"Thank you. Between the NYT and WaPo, which would you say is worth subscribing to? I don't have money for both but would like full access to one reputable source of information and investigative journalism"
YouShouldKnow,ff3b7fp,t1_ff3739f,1579537772.0,"I want to support good journalism but I know people personally and have heard of many people who have *had to cancel credit cards* just to get the NYT to stop charging them. Many outlets provide horribly convoluted processes to unsubscribe and I can't risk having to cancel my only credit card if it becomes to much of a financial strain down the road.

TLDR: I want to fund good journalism but sites often mistreat customers

p.s. I have considered using [privacy.com](https://privacy.com) for this in case I need to hard cancel a subscription but am unsure if that would work.

privacytoolsIO,ff3864t,t3_erb8xj,1579535971.0,Can also confirm that its a good service from a user end. Thanks to u/anonaddy (i think)
RBI,fdyjjsm,t3_encsyg,1578780492.0,You may want to check [this website](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to see if you email/credentials have been involved in a breach at ubisoft or another company.
privacy,fd87tr7,t1_fd85n02,1578214929.0,I must have misunderstood you. I thought that you meant that proton mail doesn't have an app out. Sorry about that.
privacy,fd74kto,t1_fd1bxyp,1578199352.0,I totally agree. I hope the mods see this and consider it.
privacy,fd74a59,t1_fd0ky5c,1578199240.0,welcome anyway!
privacy,fd6znms,t1_fczkkqv,1578197685.0,Absolutely. I don't know how to cut out whatsapp without cutting out people or trying to persuade them to switch over to signal or something else. You can only do the best you can and its all a balance.
privacy,fd6z5rj,t1_fcyzy5l,1578197525.0,Are news apps also big privacy offenders?
privacy,fd6yyh2,t1_fcyrgxo,1578197454.0,This is a good comparison that I hadn't thought of before. Thank you!
privacy,fd6y22u,t1_fd0dw1o,1578197136.0,Otherwise there is little hope of large scale legislative changes to the sources of the privacy-invasions that we are trying to avoid.
privacy,fd6xd1y,t1_fcz25nq,1578196897.0,"Well I'm sort of a noob here too, but I've been turbo-lurking here for a couple months and I think the starter kit stuff should really be the things you can easily do in a few minutes to make more of what you do more private. Here are a few of those things that I see recommended often and are also easy enough to implement:

1. If you're able, download Firefox. You don't have to give up chrome if that's what you use at this point. Just try and do more of your personal browsing on firefox if you can. Its also okay if you don't do all the 'privacy hardening' things right away. You can always do those later once you pick the low hanging fruit.
2. Go to the menu on firefox on the top right (the three horozontal bars), click ad ons, and add these add ons for firefox (also if you need to keep your current browser they may be available for that too):
   1. Cookie AutoDelete
   2. uBlock Origin
   3. HTTPS Everywhere
   4. Decentraleyes
   5. Privacy Badger
3. Download a password manager like Bitwarden and start using it for some of your accounts so that you understand how it works. You can then move more and more accounts to Bitwarden or another secure password manager and start to use generated, unique passwords for your stuff.
4. Go through the settings of the apps that you use. Do you show up on snapmap for example? One way to be more private for starters is to change your settings in the apps that you use to not share that data with other people you know or others on the internet. Another example is your venmo if you use that or your social accounts that you don't want to delete? Are those set to private? Even in your google account you can change settings to make it more private. Is it always perfect? no, but its a good start and its way better than doing nothing. 

I hope this is helpful! I'm not too knowledgeable but if you have questions I might be able to point you in the direction of sites that have the answers you're looking for. Good luck!"
privacy,fd6txwu,t1_fcyprwd,1578195670.0,"Man i've spent the past two months working on disentangling myself from google and I still have a ways to go. Their built in password manager has saved every password for years before I even knew what a password manager is. I have to move every one over to bitwarden and i'm about halfway there. Also every login made with google is another thing I have to disentangle. It's taking awhile but slow progress is still progress. Right now I'm the guy who's running firefox and is getting rid of social media accounts.

 I do have one question though, If you or someone else has the time. If I delete my facebook account, do they delete my data or do I just lose some control over it? Would I be better to never use facebook again but keep my inactive account or go ahead and delete it?"
privacy,fd6oif4,t1_fd0zda9,1578193811.0,"Protonmail's IOS app is already out and its well designed

Edit: wanted to add that I'm super excited that theses sorts of services are getting really user friendly for the average skilled person like me"
minimalism,fcmcey8,t3_ehxlv7,1577770393.0,What did you expect to miss before you got rid of it but didn't miss at all once it was gone?
