pornfree,ff8c3go,t1_ff7ydgg,1579672488.0,"I’m extremely uncomfortable with not thinking. I tried to practice mindfulness at one point. But, I kept making excuses: “you can only daydream in bed”, “you can only think about something serious”, “on the weekends you can think and daydream all day”. Eventually I just stopped. Sometimes it’s overwhelming. I’ll have moments where I’m sitting doing homework or on YouTube and I just get up and start pacing. I used to spend hours pacing my room and talking to myself. In public, I’ll start thinking and realize I’m smiling to myself or whispering to myself or walking weirdly.  

I think about money, being able to buy a car, new phones, food, and many cringy moments from my past. The two most consistent things I tend to think about are the things I used to do with my friends and one day being able to rebuy my parent’s home. But, those thoughts always evolve into something upsetting. Like, every time I think about my friends, I remember one moment that really still bothers me. I had a female friend at a time when I was at a really bad place. And I remember vividly watching all those male motivation podcasts and YouTubers that basically spewed TRP bs. I remember the months of being an a genuine asshole and cringy jerk. In every sense of the word, I was sexually harassing someone. Despite being 4 years ago, I think about that probably daily. Despite having tons of friends, I’m always led back to thinking of moments I could’ve done better instead of the moments I had amazing interactions with my friends. And when it comes to daydreaming about success, I always flashback to high school. I remember the last year of high school, I was really proud of getting a 1290 on the SAT and getting into an ok University. But towards the last months of school everyone was getting into crazy schools. We had Cornell acceptance letters, Harvard, Virginia Tech, John Hopkins, UMD. I realized everyone was really working hard during high school while I slacked through. Yet, even with my goal of writing a book, I start to believe that it’s not going to happen and lose motivation. Because everyone else is well on their way to their goals and I’m just starting so late. I feel like I’ve wasted a lot and won’t get there. I’m constantly flipping between thinking of moments that give me extreme encouragement/self-confidence and those that give me remorseful reflection."

I’m a spanish major that tested into Spanish 310 my first year. But you have to PAY to buy back the credits for the classes you tested out of.

pornfree,feconiw,t1_febp1yf,1578979272.0,"Yea I’ve been doing that a lot lately. I feel like I’m right on the verge of a relapse after taking 7 months just to break 2 days. I haven’t had money since starting college. But, every time I get money I dream of spending it on porn or paying for pics or something. For Christmas, I got $400. All I can think about is spending it on porn. You’d think being poor would make me frugal with money. But the thought of blowing my only money on porn is levels of arousing I haven’t felt since I first found porn. And all over something simple. Tomorrow’s going to be a huge struggle to not relapse because I’m literally going through the costs of porn in my head right now.

pornfree,fe5e65y,t1_fe52dgh,1578868245.0,"I should rephrase that for me. I got type 1 diabetes as a child and I have asthma. So the first two days of a cold I’m struggling to get out of bed. A secret between you and me: I was always envious of my friends that would get sick because they’d just power through. I fear getting a job and getting sick because I’m bed-ridden. Most of the time it’s warranted, sometimes it’s just because I’m a baby when it comes to colds.  

I can relate to social anxiety. I always hated hearing people say “just do it”. But, I remember, and yes this is cringy but I don’t go there anymore, I was reading TRP posts in sophomore year of highschool. One of the posts there was about conquering anxiety and interacting with people before you have the chance to overthink it. That was life-changing advice. I finally said “fuck it” and became that guy who said “Hi” to everyone, everyday, until someone started saying it back. I ended highschool extremely popular after having only three friends from 6th grade to 9th grade. I don’t know how old you are but I think the hardest thing about social anxiety is learning when to say no. When you don’t have friends, you’ll accept people into your life that are bad. But, you’ll tolerate it because you don’t like that feeling of not having anyone. Even if they’re detrimental to you. I think once you learn to say “no” to that mindset and take your losses when it comes to interacting with people, you’ll become popular in no time. Not fake popularity, but genuine popularity with people you truly care about and that care for you."

ShitPostCrusaders,fdts0np,t1_fdsmzgt,1578721299.0,"Diavolo states multiple times that he’s invincible in a 1 on 1. But, he also comments that he would never face multiple stand users together because he knows he’d lose. The benefit of King Crimson is that he can re-situate himself anywhere. He can’t re-situate and attack at the same time though when there’s multiple stand users. I argue that any AOE stand could defeat Diavolo.  

With The World, you can nullify AOE stands with by attacking the stand in timestop like Dio did to Kakyoin. If Hierophant’s was set up around Diavolo, it would still be set up when time skip ends. Diavolo can’t interact with the barrier. It’d be the same thing against Vitamin C. Time skip would end and Diavolo would still be close enough to touch Vitamin C’s barrier and melt. Not to mention, having a fast stand.  

Star Platinum, I think, could easily react right after time skip ends. Diavolo doesn’t immediately drop his hand after it ends. He hesitates before he chops his enemy or donuts them. Star Platinum could easily block and counter before Diavolo regains time skip. And, if we go to the extreme and look at Pucci, Made in Heaven would easily move out of the way before Diavolo’s hand makes contact. By extension, Diavolo wouldn’t be able to touch Pucci himself because Pucci rides Made in Heaven.  

So basically, I think any AOE or fast Stand could beat Diavolo without needing a requiem arrow. And any GROUP of stand users would definitely kill Diavolo with maybe one or two casualties."

Also, I don’t know if you’ve ever watched penguinz0, but he always goes on rants about cellshading and how it’s a cheap graphics style. That sketch look looks really trash.

As much as I hate walking around campus, I enjoyed that whenever I wanted, I could go walk somewhere or just sit outside. I wasn’t fortunate enough to be gifted a car in highschool. I live in Maryland and everything cool is about a 30min drive away. So, the one thing I really anticipated in college was being able to walk places and leave when I want to leave.

GooglePixel,fc3ouen,t3_e4iiww,1577394913.0,"Pixel 4 from an IPhone 6s Plus  

I’m looking into buying the base Pixel 4 from my iPhone 6s. The most important factor in choosing all the phones that came out this year were gimmicks and aesthetics. With the pixel, I really love the design and I want to use soli. However, I’m set on the base model because I want a phone I can slip in my pocket instead of my backpack and a phone with which I can reach the entire screen with one hand. However, I wanted to ask these following questions from base users.   

Battery Life: My iPhone 6s has 91% battery health. It’s starting to die pretty fast. I don’t use my phone often. I check messages in the morning and then forget about it for most of the day. Since starting college, the only time my phone leaves my room is when I walk off campus and use Apple Maps to get around. So, the majority of my use is at nighttime/nap time when I lay in bed and look at reddit. The things I’m concerned about are how quickly the phone dies with everything turned on. My first experience with android, I want to keep AOD on, I want all the soli features in, and I’m always on that max brightness life. I planned on buying a $30 portable charger to go with it. But, in the event that I forget it(which I’m certain will happen a lot) how will my battery fare? Will I have to spend the time going through disabling settings? Will I make it the hour or three I usually stay off campus without worrying? So that’s my main question.   

Apple Music - I love Apple Music. On my iPhone, I can play Apple Music, occasionally turning on my screen to switch songs, for a four hour car ride and only lose like 8% battery life. For anyone that uses Apple Music on android, is battery drain the same? Is it still extremely glitchy on android? I check in on r/AppleMusic occasionally and it always sounds like people on android have nothing but problems with it. Making sure I can use Apple Music and reddit at the same time on long car rides without plummeting to like 40% would be really helpful. On my 6s, using reddit, Apple Maps, and Apple Music, at a 100% on a four hour car ride will have me reach my destination at 60%. So will the pixel compare?   

Photos - I don’t ever take photos on my phone. I barely ever receive photos. But all of my friends have iPhones and I read here that the photo quality is really bad. I wanted to know if that’s from like Live Photos or memes and stuff. Like, is it every picture coming via text from an iPhone or if it’s only photos taken on an iPhone sent to a pixel. Additionally, how good is camera zoom on the pixel? Whenever I want to take a picture it’s usually of like birds in a tree or an animal in the distance. But, my 6s pictures are always fuzzy and blurry from the range I usually take pictures. Is the pixel 4 going to do the same or get clearer pictures?   

Thanks to anyone that responds. I’ve noticed a few of comments here don’t get replies, so I hope someone can answer my question. I really don’t want the iPhone 11 cause of the size. And if all of my concerns can get an answer, that’d be killer. Thanks."
