If I got to a point where I couldn't transfer to a planet with a PC crash during the load screen, I would change the crew members for my party, or go solo.

For some reason this would get past the glitch, I'd transfer to the planet, transfer right back to the ship and select the crew I really wanted to bring.  

I have no explanation.  I just know it worked for me.  I was about to give up on the game on a couple of instances before I figured out this 'hack'.

Scylla was by far the worst for me, but it happened in a couple of other spots too."
