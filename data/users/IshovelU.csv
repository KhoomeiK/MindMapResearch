I’m sure by the 3rd one you read you’ll say “these are all completely safe”.  👌. But don’t question it, or you will he pounced on and called names by the internet social justice mob."
facepalm,fefbgb4,t3_eordmm,1579052641.0,I’ll get right on that. What’s a ‘peson’?
facepalm,fef77oq,t3_eordmm,1579049814.0,"Social Justice Warriors unite!  I’m far far from an ‘anti-vaxxer’ but whatever names you gotta call to make you feel like a real boy, go for it.  The fact that you tools think there’s ONE ingredient in the 77 vaccinations (or however many there are now) is ludicrous. I never said anyone shouldn’t vaccinate, I just laugh at the f’n wannabe internet doctors claiming they know all.  Hate to make people actually think about things, when it’s so much easier to call em names and yap about Mac n cheese."

facepalm,feey7f9,t3_eordmm,1579043816.0,Can anyone list the ingredients in any of these shots?  Everyone seems SO knowledgeable.  Maybe start with the swine flu vaccine.  👌

worldnews,f86vjoe,t3_dz3ccs,1574307980.0,"It all is. Every thread I see is some under 25 know it all who thinks they have the goods on American politics. Never cracked a book. I can’t stand all politicians, so I guess I’m Independent, but listening to soapbox morons everyday makes we want to vote Trump just for spite."
