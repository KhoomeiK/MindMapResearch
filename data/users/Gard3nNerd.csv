AmItheAsshole,ff7hdcs,t1_ff42yze,1579649583.0,"he's going to make that baby's life hell too OP. Seriously think about this, does your son have a mean/violent streak to him? would he hurt the baby because it's a product of your wife's? It might be best to not have him around right now as your wife is going through something life changing, as well as the hardest thing she'll ever have to do - give birth! do not stress her out during these crucial last weeks with your son's bullshit, now is the time to take your wife and soon-to-be-child's side."

airplants,fe8v545,t1_fduy2w3,1578931299.0,"air plants like humidity so a very dry room isn't great for them, but no dry rot is caused by a lack of air flow. The base of my air plant was inside the pineapple looking thing and no air could really get to it so it started dry rotting like this"

I had appendicitis a few years ago, Dr didn't want to run all the tests and told me to go home, I refused to leave feeling the way I did. They finally looked at my digestive system (when they were just writing it off as severe cramping in my pelvis, the easiest thing to blame for women right?) and immediately sent me to the hospital for emergency surgery.
