SuicideWatch,femfxix,t3_epwvfr,1579253438.0,"Same. I don't remember what being genuinely happy felt like. Being depressed made me lose interest in so many things, i chose my major based on what i remember liking."

SuicideWatch,fcmw4oe,t1_fclqdiq,1577794990.0,I wish you the best too. Happy New Year
SuicideWatch,fcmvs81,t1_fcmvm3r,1577794557.0,I don't know. I was supposed to go see a therapist two years ago. My parents refused. Now even after turning 18 i can't go cause i can't pay.
SuicideWatch,fcmuoz6,t1_fcm4qfz,1577793147.0,"Same for me here. I'm not going to say all of them are good friends or all of them are bad friends. I used to have a friend that stopped talking to me because i wasn't funny anymore (stopped laughing at jokes and stuff) and whenever i was in a bad mood, sad, even when i lost someone, she would stop talking to me and then come back when i was happy. She only wanted to be friends with me when i was in a good mood. So yeah she didn't about the suicide talk. She ignored me. You can call this a bad friend.

Now my other friends, who still talk to me when i'm at my worst, yeah they're still next to me after the suicide talk. And yeah now they either don't respond or act like they don't care. I asked about it once to a friend, he just said that they all cared a lot, they just didn't know what to do or say, they loved me but most of them didn't understand mental illnesses, they didn't understand why I wasn't happy.

So that was long. For more information, text me on www. (You know how to go to my profile)"
SuicideWatch,fcmu4zk,t1_fckh7x1,1577792387.0,I explained a part of it in the comment below.
SuicideWatch,fcmu1wf,t1_fcl2odj,1577792268.0,"I'm actually the opposite. I always say what i think, say no when i don't want to. I just lost everything. I don't feel happiness anymore, i can't even concentrate anymore, i'm too slow. Like i can't concentrate when my friends are talking, everything is too fast for me and i'm just too slow to make an actual response. So when i don't participate in discussion and stuff i'm just pushing myself out of the group. I used to love reading but i can't read a book anymore like i immediately forget what i just read and i have to repeat. And that's just a book. Let's not talk about my studies. And now I don't enjoy things anymore, don't laugh at jokes anymore, I don't even know if I like this or not."
SuicideWatch,fckgdi6,t1_fckamlf,1577724727.0,"The thing is I'm not searching for my purpose in life. The reason why i want to die isn't because i feel useless or because no one cares. It's actually the opposite, many people care and count on me wich is stopping me from killing myself. I just want to die because I'm tired and unhappy."
SuicideWatch,fck40xd,t1_fcjyv9u,1577715944.0,Haha thank you (didn't know what to respond i guess i'll sound selfish (like yeah i know i'm amazing) whatever i say)
SuicideWatch,fck3rle,t1_fck1stv,1577715720.0,I guess you're right. Maybe I'm too sensitive or overthinking too much
SuicideWatch,fck3c62,t1_fcjy3vk,1577715348.0,Sure
SuicideWatch,fcjxesg,t3_ehfw42,1577709244.0,I'm so glad you're safe. I really don't know what to say. I hope you'll get better and that one day you'll find your reason to live.
SuicideWatch,fcjwt6q,t3_eha0nv,1577708485.0,I swear i care and i wish i could do something
AskReddit,fbu00ps,t1_fbr0yay,1577104151.0,I'm good i guess. Have a nice daaaay
