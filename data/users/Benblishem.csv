Once a dept. starts with white I think they often tend to stay with white as their tradition, just as many stick with traditional red rather than switch to the highly visible greenish yellow (not sure what to call that hi-vis color). With the incredible cost of fire trucks I doubt a price difference between red or white is a huge consideration, though I could well be wrong."
