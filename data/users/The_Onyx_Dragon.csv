unpopularopinion,fchc6z3,t1_fcgzsam,1577649190.0,"Actually pre transitioned youth brains have brains that more accurately fall on the spectrum of their gender. “[Brain activity and structure in transgender adolescents more closely resembles the typical activation patterns of their desired gender, according to new research. The findings suggest that differences in brain function may occur early in development and that brain imaging may be a useful tool for earlier identification of transgenderism in young people.](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180524112351.htm)”"
unpopularopinion,fcgyub3,t1_fcgufd8,1577645439.0,"“Danish parliament struck a blow for transgender rights and became the first country to remove trans people’s classification as “mentally ill.” In this New Year’s Day move the government took official action to destigmatize transgender individuals, separating them from any association with words such as “problem,” “disorder” or dysphoria.”

Couldn’t find any statements from the WHO but this is from an article about why it was removed and what started its removal. It’s really stupid, “activists” are relating this to calling gay a mental illness but unlike homosexuality, gender dysphoria is obviously a mental illness.

“Danish politicians had announced last year that they hoped to spur the World Health Organization (WHO) to remove transgender from a category of mental illnesses in its globally used International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10), whose codes are used to mark health records, track epidemiological trends and inform insurance reimbursement. If WHO did not act by January 1, 2017, Denmark had promised to act unilaterally.”"
unpopularopinion,fcgtr78,t1_fcflfm5,1577643900.0,Yeah it wasn’t added to the DSM - 6 although the page it’s still on the [American Psychiatric Association website](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria). It was probably not added because of backlash from the small but loud part of the trans community that is... special. They are mostly MtFs that believe that they get periods and people of that sort. Have a nice day!

unpopularopinion,fcgqxe3,t1_fcg5jkk,1577643096.0,"I agree that perhaps that is true for gender non conforming people although trauma can’t change the fact that a females brain falls on the male spectrum and vice versa.  “[Findings from neuroimaging studies focusing on brain structure suggest that the brain phenotypes of trans women (MtF) and trans men (FtM) differ in various ways from control men and women with feminine, masculine, demasculinized and defeminized features.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=transgender+brain+study&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DQQwiusr7ikgJ) ” this is an article about such brain scans. Yes, trauma stunts brain growth but it cannot cause sex changes determined in the womb. And yes, there is a lot of self hatred but that is because we are in the wrong body. Our fat placement is wrong, our genitals are wrong, everything is wrong and it causes dysphoria which causes the self hatred."
unpopularopinion,fccy7ir,t1_fcctr0f,1577604073.0,"Well saying trans doesn’t exist is kinda ignorant, saying as it’s a born mental illness that develops in the womb when the brain and body grow with different sexes. Now gender non conforming on the other hand, has no known medical basis and is almost always people trying to get mad at other for “misgendering” others. I do understand where you’re coming from though as it’s a mental illness that hasn’t been researched for awhile and just been called gender dysphoria and swept under the rug. It’s pretty late where I live so I’m gonna go to bed, but if you wanna check out more before I get back online I recommend looking at Blaire White’s YouTube channel. She’s a transgender YouTube who a lot of people have said that she changed their opinions of trannies and they’ve become fans of her. Have a pleasant day, goodnight!"

PewdiepieSubmissions,fc6qgak,t3_eg5i1z,1577486882.0,"It especially sucks when people take experiences from others and argue for them. Like I’m transgender, I agree it’s a mental illness, but some liberal motherfuckers are like “No ItS nOt A mEnTaL IlLnEsS bEcAuSe It MaKeS pEoPlE sAd.” Ok. Sure. It’s not like I wanna neck myself any time I move the wrong way and my body moves the wrong way because of improper development in the womb. And people group us with gender nonconforming people, but we don’t want that but when we disagree we’re somehow transphobic even though we’re trans and they’re not. We have gender dysphoria and they don’t, theres a difference but they don’t respect or acknowledge it."
