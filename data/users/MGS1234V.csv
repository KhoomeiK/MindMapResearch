Smite,ffjs62p,t1_ffi8tx0,1580005490.0,The card art for the skin Sun Wu Xing is pretty nice looking. I also really dig the style. I could see it on a tapestry or cut from stained glass with the black interspersing the colours.
FireEmblemHeroes,ffioix7,t1_ffibgcg,1579978810.0,"This version is so much easier to look at, love it!"
bioniclememes,ffaodoa,t3_esfrph,1579740692.0,And then Galidor came out the next year.
IAmA,ff4gv95,t1_ff4ggcx,1579563301.0,"I don’t need any measurements as you’d be the best judge of their relative size. I am interested to possibly see how well you can palm a basketball or something of similar size. 

Fingers crossed for a clean bill of health on the cardiac side of things, reading over your replies you seem to have a pretty good grasp on your own strengths and weaknesses too. Thanks for doing an AMA!"
IAmA,ff4fdgo,t3_erd8si,1579562283.0,"Other than exceptional height and the question a lot of people are wondering but aren’t asking outright regarding your... physical attributes. how does your arm span correlate to your height? (typically people are around a similar height to their wingspan) I’m curious also if the size of your hands and fingers are drastically larger proportionally? One of my taller friends, not much shorter than you actually, was not allowed to swim or do extended cardio for risk of his heart having problems. Have you experienced any limitations like this?

AlchemistCodeGL,ff3qtdw,t3_erhhpz,1579546861.0,Thank you very much for compiling all this!
AlchemistCodeGL,ff3oy1h,t3_ergcx2,1579545722.0,"Pre farm him for when your lucky day rolls around. His Babel quest can be done daily x3 and you’ll be ready for him when he does show up. 


And very worst case scenario, if you hit 500~600 of his shards you can simply transmute him."
AlchemistCodeGL,ff382mw,t1_ff30yu7,1579535906.0,"There’s a distinct lack of fan art in this sub, I’d hardly call it spamming! Especially with Also Sprach being one of the best written stories in the game."
FireEmblemHeroes,ff1dzo6,t1_ff12eqy,1579477971.0,Ohh! That makes more sense. Love your Reinhardt work as always! Another face for my reaction pics.
FireEmblemHeroes,ff0x7qq,t3_er2omu,1579473169.0,Is that the summoner on the other side of him?

aww,feulaao,t1_feukbwe,1579387634.0,"My old pug was the same way, even if I was getting something and would be gone for a moment he’d stand up and try to follow (I’d usually carry him as his navigation wasn’t always on point). That’s the nicest part of elderly dogs though, You don’t even need to be doing something exciting or directly involving them. They just want to be nearby to a familiar sound or smell of their human."
aww,feujgm6,t3_eqhcc7,1579387106.0,"Deaf or not, I believe it’s always good to talk to them like you do. One of my dogs was deaf and despite not hearing at all (according to the vet) he still seemed to hear the vibration of spoken words. He was also almost entirely blind so I’m not sure if he just managed to detect it through his whiskers or through his paws on the floor or maybe even just through smell. Either way, she is very very sweet. Senior dogs make the best cuddlers too."
AlchemistCodeGL,fesd8fa,t3_eqgbaq,1579364057.0,She’d do even better with her ranger job enhanced.
AlchemistCodeGL,fepi4d3,t3_eqbd8w,1579321087.0,"Sacred spearman and valkyries actually use different weapons. Spears and lance respectively. Sacred spearman rely on critical damage while valkyries either jump (fallen valkyrie) or use attacks that scale off physical defense (holy Valkyrie). Classes like spy and ninja while they may seem similar have different jobs in regard to damage dealing and utility skills. A spy doing more damage and lowering enemy resistance while a ninja will focus on inflicting status such as poison or paralysis. There are no two jobs that are exactly the same, though many can fill a very similar niche. I recommend looking over the database or wiki if you are curious about a skillset. The TAC discord group is also very helpful with specific inquiries."
gaming,fem3fgo,t3_epmk42,1579238462.0,"I’d much rather have to wait for quality versus a rushed mess. There’s also so many other games on my list to play that I can wait without any contempt for this change. I think this is a really respectable move when a lesser company might be like “hey, we already have our deadline. Let’s just speed it along and release as planned”"

AlchemistCodeGL,feicm2v,t3_ep22jq,1579135372.0,Rebecca exists for magical damage and is infinitely more useful and accessible than Blitz... he’s pretty much dead on arrival. Only plus is hopefully since he has lightning spy JE that means Roxanne will also get that spy JE in the near future.
explainlikeimfive,fecr92b,t1_fecl52z,1578981627.0,If they fixed the dryness you wouldn’t need their product anymore.
AlchemistCodeGL,fdyfis7,t3_encyfd,1578779219.0,"On the alchemist code wiki there is a number of pages including farmable gear, along with where to farm it. A general rule of thumb is looking at the base rarity. If 5 stars, typically a vision clear reward or special event item (like Selena’s rose or Armour of wrath). If the item is base 4 star rarity it is usually from paid gacha rolls, three star are typically farmable or common gacha rolls. Two and one stars have predominantly been collab items or gear such as character specific weapons (like Laharl’s sword)."

DeathStranding,fcotbs4,t3_eib8bh,1577840986.0,"Sometimes all you can do is keep on keeping on, and hope that your structure helps even one person. I’d call that a success."
DeathStranding,fcfysix,t1_fcf7kj3,1577634953.0,"One of the main premises of the game is the seemingly aimless wandering. You and Sam will start to “get it” as time goes on, and the game does a pretty good job to make sure you’re not completely lost. Just know the game world expands massively after a few chapters and more options will present themselves to you. The advice people will likely give you will be intentionally vague as to avoid spoilers. Reading about it versus playing it yourself doesn’t do the story justice."
TheMonkeysPaw,fc9q9bm,t3_egqzhq,1577556559.0,Granted. You no longer see ads for things you have purchased but must compulsively buy a product after seeing an ad for it the first time.
Smite,fc66bc7,t3_egeg68,1577473262.0,The look of one who has achieved true enlightenment in Smite.
PetTheDamnDog,fc3hi7o,t3_eftsr5,1577389915.0,OP delivers.
