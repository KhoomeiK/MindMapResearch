One of my parents was born in New York but moved away while still a kid; otherwise I didn't know anyone there and I had never been east of the Pacific time zone. My whole experience was of just not getting it. I was about to leave for school when my parents told me to stay and watch TV, and I complained that I was going to be late if I stayed but they said my teachers would understand. I saw the buildings burning on the TV but I really had no sense of scale for the significance so I didn't get much beyond some people flew planes into some buildings in New York. It wasn't discussed extensively at school and I don't recall anyone being acutely upset, but people were kind of on-edge for a few weeks. Soon after that we coincidentally had a lockdown due to some creeper in the neighborhood, but I think some kids were worried it was related. Around that time I also started watching the Daily Show with my family and when they were still talking about 9/11 every night after like a month, that's when it started to sink in that this was going to affect everything forever. It's weird in retrospect how I learned about the WTC and Pentagon specifically after that event, and my crash introduction to politics, other than Al Gore with climate change, was entirely in the context of whether we were responding to 9/11 appropriately. The only thing I remember from the way it was before is airport screenings."

ABoringDystopia,ffm3hac,t1_ffl5dpc,1580047896.0,"Dunno how average my health insurance is, I suspect it's better than average, but I personally pay around $850 in premiums each year. That's partially subsidized by my employer, so the insurance company is getting more. That's for the high deductible plan, where I have to pay $1500 out of pocket before anything is covered other than ""preventative services"" (like one appointment per year with a primary doc and gynecologist, plus a certain list of screenings and birth control). After I pay for $1500 worth of care, then I pay 20% of the price, up until I've spent $3250 out of pocket in total (on services, not including the premiums). For people who choose a plan with a lower deductible, the premiums are a lot higher so typically they end up paying more, just less of it at the point of service.

This is also more complicated because what things ""cost out of pocket"" is slightly reduced just because I HAVE insurance and they negotiate deals with medical providers. Basically, my insurance isn't ""covering"" anything when I pay my deductible, but it costs me less because the doctor accepts less payment in exchange for getting to see patients under my insurance because nobody wants to see a doctor that isn't covered. Also, because I have what's considered a high deductible plan, I get a Health Savings Account that I get to put money into before it is taxed, so as long as I set enough pre-tax withholding to cover everything I'll need for the year, there's also something like a 20% advantage on the money I'm using to pay for everything.

Treatment wise? If you have any diphenhydramine and know where it is, chew up two pills and hold it under your tongue the best you can. That's the first thing you would get (likely by IV) at the hospital after an epi pen incident. It's not as fast acting as you'd want but it increases the chance you won't close up completely or will get some air again after losing consciousness.

I realize these steps would be difficult to carry out at the same time but if you regularly carry any pills with you maybe throw in a couple of DPH just in case, it can't hurt to have and is nearly free compared to an epi pen (editing to clarify: you should have an epi pen if you have a severe allergy of any kind, but if you've never had a reason to think you might need one, DPH is a cheap item you can hold as insurance against a freak event). You probably have a few minutes before you're incapacitated.

fatlogic,fffva8s,t1_fffrgno,1579892561.0,"Other comments have given good advice on the distinction between satisfied and full, and the mental tricks of transitioning from a surplus to a deficit at all. As a person dieting off vanity pounds by eating not too far above my BMR, I'm going to focus rather narrowly on coping with feeling hungry.

First, I make sure my food is nutritious. I make sure I'm getting a lot of protein and enough fiber, that my carbs are relatively low glycemic, and that I'm eating from all food groups, ideally in the same meal. I don't want actual deficiencies to mess me up unnecessarily. That includes ENOUGH water, not necessarily loads, but drinking before and/or after a meal can make it feel like more.

Second, I make sure my food is stuff I like, stuff that will make my brain go ""yay!"" when I take it out to eat. If I am just not digging the healthy stuff one day for whatever reason, that takes priority, but I might allot 100 calories or even expand my budget for the day by 100 calories to have a ""fun food."" If it's carby, I eat it with a meal so it doesn't cause rebound hunger.

Third, all of this is planned - sometimes the entire day in MFP, sometimes only loosely, but I know what to expect going into the day. You may have to find out whether an IF style approach or a small frequent meal approach works for you, but I think at a certain point you have to decide whether you want to tolerate being quite hungry for some time but get to be completely satisfied when you eat, or come up slightly short most of the time but never be too far from the next one.

What I gather from IFers, especially the OMAD type, is that your body eventually learns not to be hungry if you're not gonna eat at that time of day, but your single meal capacity doesn't necessarily increase to capture the calories you skipped. I go for the small snacks, because it's almost always possible to say ""one more hour,"" or drink water as you mentioned (edit: removed redundancy), or Diet Coke in my case. Diet Coke won't hold me over for 8 hours or even 3 hours and it can seem interminable, but even a 60 calorie snack will give me a little satisfaction for long-enough."

If you're not set on the mini pill, many people have better luck with IUDs for levonorgestrel or Nexplanon for desogestrel/etonogestrel. I didn't like drospirenone for other reasons (don't eat enough sodium to keep up with the diuretic effect) but I'm also not looking for low estrogen options because I like the effect estrogen has on me, so I can double dip in that respect for bleeding control."
birthcontrol,ffbvgsa,t1_ff963h5,1579784119.0,"For Canada, also check into desogestrel and levonorgestrel mini pills! Neither of those are available in the US, but desogestrel is used in Europe and levonorgestrel exists although I'm not sure where it's used. My understanding is that norethindrone is the absolute lowest dose relative to its potency in mini pills, so any of the above should be an improvement for your issues if you can get them, though they don't have all the advantages I described for drospirenone.

Also, as the other commenter alluded to, there are progestin only methods that aren't pills, with levonorgestrel IUDs seeming to have the best reputation for a positive effect on bleeding patterns, but they all require some commitment to wait it out until either it washes out (Depo) or you get it removed by a doctor (IUD or Nexplanon) if you don't like it."

birthcontrol,ff6fph4,t3_erx47r,1579626199.0,"Basically it takes a while to develop an egg, and if it's put on hold for long enough, the old partially developed egg can't be used anymore. So if you take 21 days of active pills, the ovaries can't work on any eggs and the one it may have had before isn't good by the placebo break, so you have to start from scratch and 7 days isn't long enough to make a new one. But if you took only 4 active pills and then miss one, they might be able to pick up the old egg and keep working on it. Conversely if you've taken 17 pills and only have 4 left, you might get a head start on making a new egg which will then get picked up for 7 days on the break. That's why the middle of the active pills is the least risky time to miss a pill.

It's a little more complicated than that but that's the basic idea, your body is always trying to make an egg if it's not suppressed by hormones but it takes time and there's a limit to how long it can hit pause on the same one.

You don't have to take placebo pills though. Most people find they bleed on a regular predictable pattern if they set aside a week per month for it, and otherwise it may be random and get annoying, but medically speaking if you would rather take active pills all the time there's no reason you can't."
