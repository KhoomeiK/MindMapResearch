bettafish,ff935zd,t3_es3mmn,1579703707.0,I had a female betta that was fat like that and it eventually developed into dropsy and she passed away.  Maybe fast for a week or 5 days or something and see if the bloat goes down

Aquariums,feojj3p,t1_feog67u,1579300963.0,Yes. Females have solid blue lines or “beard” on their gill plate while males either have dots or nothing blue. He has nothing blue on his gill plate and a few dots around his eyes.

Mine are at like ten. The amount of molts they have does not determine their health. Ive heard the higher the temperature, the faster they grow"
ATBGE,feifdwv,t3_ep7sv1,1579137238.0,I really like this kind of art
Saxophonics,fefejn0,t3_eovfvz,1579054639.0,I also have problems with practicing at home because I do not sound the way I like. https://youtu.be/4N2cBtqu97w This youtube video helped me get over my frustrations.
Cichlid,fefb25r,t1_fefaflh,1579052384.0,Thats awesome to hear maybe ill tru again with an EBJD one day. Have they ever had off spring? I know that electric pink jack dempseys are a thing.
Cichlid,fef8epz,t3_eoqaza,1579050625.0,Whats your opinion of EBJDs? Ive heard and experienced there poor health due to weak genes. Has this been a problem for you too?

Cichlid,fecbgyx,t1_fecb3gd,1578970144.0,Its a leucistic jack dempey which is like albino but no red eyes. They are called pink jack dempseys or gold jack dempseys

Cichlid,feb17a9,t1_feaxcst,1578954429.0,Very interesting ill probably move him out next weekend anyways
Cichlid,feawrdw,t1_featicl,1578952982.0,Well the peacock is very small and likely going to be removed so he hasnt caused any issues. . It would be a different situation if the peacock was an adult
Cichlid,feawijf,t1_fear0pz,1578952906.0,I tried keeping an ebjd it didn’t live past a few months. Hopefully breeders can find a healthy strain.
Cichlid,feaqfnc,t1_feapc3r,1578951351.0,That is a pink jack dempsey. I called up some of the stores around me and asked if they have any in stock and one happened to have some. If there are none around in stock you can order them online.
Cichlid,feakvvn,t3_eoacce,1578949969.0,"I gave these fish to my friend about a year ago while they were both smaller and just recently got them back into my 75 gallon. They are the only two fish in this tank other than a small OB peacock that I accidentally left behind when taking out the old fish in this tank. Lucky, they all show no aggression to each other. The regular jack dempsey’s got a bit messed up due to a fin rot problem my friend had while it was in his care. He has made big recovery and Im looking forward to seeing him back in shape with proper fins."
Cichlid,fe7hj2l,t1_fe7gwhr,1578914548.0,I might be able to get one later on
Cichlid,fe7hcun,t1_fe5u0uq,1578914468.0,"Females have the blue beard, Not males"
Cichlid,fe7gchs,t3_enyz2d,1578914288.0,Jack dempsey. 90% thats a male. He has very great coloration for that age. The minimum tank they should be kept in as a ten inch adult should be a 55 by it self with heavy filtration but it is heavily argued a 75 is much better . I raised mine in a 40 breeder and eventually put him into a 75.
bettafish,fe6c1f2,t3_envrip,1578886607.0,very impressive
MadeMeSmile,fe6btk5,t3_enr9ha,1578886444.0,As an aquarium owner this brings up a lot of issues

Cichlid,fe65c8y,t1_fe62zko,1578882132.0,One is about 3 years and the other is 2. They are 8 and 7 inches.
Cichlid,fe5yjln,t1_fe5wozm,1578877802.0,Alright Ill consider that
Cichlid,fe5yiaq,t1_fe5wnv9,1578877778.0,I have two canisters. a fluval 206 rated for a 40 gallon and a fluval 306 rated for 70 gallons. The tank is well established and has been running for almost two years.

Aquariums,fdt98xk,t1_fdt3mgt,1578713581.0,"Having that driftwood really helps as a base. I put down the biggest ones before adding sand, then I basically just piled them around the driftwood in spots that were sturdy and didn’t move. The rocks are decently heavy and since I put down the first layer of rocks before the sand, I have never had any issues with fish causing rocks to fall. I really like the look of it and the cichlids swim threw out it all day long."

Aquariums,fdhxuuj,t1_fdht5ec,1578432132.0,He is keeping it in a 75 I do not know how he got it looking so bad perhaps other fish nipping or lack of water changes? I specified that the bin is heated and filtered because I didn’t want people assuming I was putting him in a bin of plain water. He is with a few convicts and a pink jack Dempsey of the same size who us perfectly healthy. They have all been in the tank together for about the same amount of time.
