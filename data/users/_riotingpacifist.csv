There is no fixed formula for `num units that ship at a price` but production cost is rarely a factor (when it is, it's usually due to competition engaging in a race to the bottom or the cost of production being known by consumers, neither of which apply to coke). As coke isn't a hype item (e.g supreme, fashion, etc), it will generally be inversely proportional to price (e.g as price goes up less people buy it).

There is a caveat, and that is that because a lot of people think price is related to production cost, coke could make a fuss about any new law, and convince consumers to pay more, because poor old megacorp will be making slightly less money, but that will only work because so many people are suckers when it comes to corporate propoganda."

That's what regulations on sales are for. Besides if you are talking about extasy pills it takes about 10, which is far more than even a regular user takes, alcohol OTOH is only a 1L of spirits. It's far easier to kill yourself on alcohol than any commonly used drugs (except heroine & meth, but they are both physically addictive so would count as self harm and be very strictly regulated/illegal).

If you are talking about marijuana, it takes over a million joints to kill yourself, so basically impossible.
