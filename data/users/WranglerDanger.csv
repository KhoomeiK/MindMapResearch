Trombone,ffjes8n,t3_etwbn3,1579996733.0,Love the finger ring on the slide. That dates it right there.

sysadmin,ffiks2c,t1_ffh3ucj,1579976239.0,The mere mention of E-Machines made my left eye twitch.
skyrim,ffihvho,t1_ffihked,1579974245.0,Just the one. I too was hoping for a couple.
Trombone,ffihsgs,t1_ffi3n62,1579974189.0,"Yep, fall vs. gliss. ""Dow"" is a great way to put it. Not pyow, beeyow or prrrrrrrrow, but dow."
skyrim,ffiemve,t3_ett9l5,1579972040.0,"So I'm adventuring along with no arrows to the knee minding my own business, and come upon this Dragon. I pop a Flame Atronoch and circle. Hit him a few times and he takes off. I think that's Serana with the lightning. 

Anyway, the dragon turns to fly and starts giving up the ghost when he has an almost full bar. WTF? Now there's a flying dragon skeleton still after us."
todayilearned,ffgqqsy,t1_ffgh5qg,1579912660.0,Not sure if that's an energy joke...
Trombone,ffgjwvv,t1_ffgfuxb,1579907937.0,All sad news. Sorry.
sysadmin,ffggm9b,t1_fffwnez,1579905781.0,"Correct. Some people think that domain-joining a Mac and allowing it to hit a fileshare is what constitutes needing a CAL. If that device gets a DHCP address on that network, uses DNS or Print, it needs a CAL. The exception would be anonymous webserver traffic."

Trombone,ffgeh40,t3_eth1k3,1579904425.0,"Cubital tunnel involves the Ulnar nerve, which affects the pinkie and outside of the hand, including part of the wrist. I have shoulder issues that also effect the Ulnar and Radial nerves. My wrist can hurt, but that is the nerves, not the wrist itself. 

Have they done a follow up scan to see if the surgery cleared up the nerve impairment in your elbow? Do anti-inflammatories and icing the elbow help? 

Mine is hurting after typing this. :("
