boardgames,ffgbgkh,t1_fffkmql,1579902561.0,"I'm game master for my group but I'm like not competitive at all and lose most of the time. I just ""go with my heart"" and make fun plays vs trying to follow every path for the absolute min max moves."
TheRightCantMeme,fffesxf,t1_ffeu36l,1579882398.0,Literally no one supports spending when you can't make bills. The problem is when your bills take 90% of your income and you spend some of the 10% left a month on entertainment and people still give you shit for daring to try to get some enjoyment out of things
AskMen,ff8z7jv,t1_ff8di2x,1579700700.0,Good luck man. I look forward to it! If you ever need play test data or anything let me know. I've helped people with that through tabletop simulator in the past.
AskMen,ff7vjgu,t1_ff788s9,1579659365.0,"That's awesome! I love playing and teaching, recently did demoing at pax unplugged, but I don't feel I have the creativity for design. Mad respect to people who can come up with these amazing games."
AskMen,ff7v44o,t3_erv3sy,1579659078.0,"Playing board games but my favorite part is teaching people new games. It's the best when they love them and I created good memories and a fun night for them.

I recently did game demos at pax unplugged and loved it, first time I put myself out there and did something like that"
boardgames,ff70ei2,t3_erzf0n,1579638613.0,I love the idea. I want to get a printer specifically to do this kind of thing. I'd sub to that right quick!
millionairemakers,fepl4l6,t3_eq81a8,1579323358.0,Cool post
ChoosingBeggars,fejlk6c,t1_fejdtn7,1579178995.0,"Yea, that's basically what I said. The problem is that this is reality right now, and something has to do convince society to change. American work culture is toxic. Women should get way more time off to spend with their kids. This isn't the case now though, so there has to be something to show that the way things are isn't good for families."
ChoosingBeggars,fei874e,t1_fehu78k,1579132449.0,No the answer is don't have kids. The species won't go extinct if a few thousand unprepared people refrain from bringing a being into the world they can't handle financially. Maybe plummeting birth rates will snap the scum that runs our society into realizing the work culture isn't conducive to humanity.
books,fef1x0z,t1_fef1ctj,1579046246.0,"I edited it, poor choice of words on my part. And yes I know it wasn't directed at me but was just contributing why some people like audio books. I found it interesting that you couldn't get into them because audio books can literally make me jump out of my seat (metaphorically, since I'm driving lol) in excitement. This is actually more than normal books for me because a good narrator can put great emotion into a scene. I am an auditory learner though so maybe that is why.

One day I hope to get back reading as much as before, reading is amazing."
books,fef0zhz,t1_fef0syn,1579045624.0,"I didn't have another comment. I used to read much more just dont have the time to sit down and read lately. I mostly just wanted to validate audiobooks because people shit talk them all the time.

Sorry if that came off snobby, but you are pretty rude yourself."
books,fef0gao,t1_feen2la,1579045275.0,"I mostly listen while driving. I havent read read in a long time because I have other things I edit: have to do, so using the downtime of driving is perfect for me."
AskReddit,fe5kvwq,t1_fe5k2j1,1578870728.0,I already know my brain is broken.
AskReddit,fe5kkm3,t1_fe5emx9,1578870614.0,"I use a debit card, but I have the opposite problem. All bills are paid directly from the bank account. If the money isn't on the account, it might as well not exist and therefore I just blow it all."
AskReddit,fe5b3ix,t1_fe491q7,1578867233.0,Mines so high that I've been paying it for 10 years and the principle went down only 2k
AskReddit,fe5akki,t1_fe3uy9k,1578867060.0,That sub just makes me even more depressed
AskReddit,fe5a75m,t1_fe3mrl8,1578866960.0,Lol I can barely make 1 month of all those at a time let alone as reserve
AskReddit,fe56ouw,t1_fe4aupr,1578866091.0,Who even uses cash nowadays I can probably count on one hand the amount of people I know that are under 50 that ever have any one them.
AskReddit,fe55uiu,t1_fe357ne,1578865911.0,Lol i haven't had 1000 in my savings in like 8 years there people live in a whole different world
AskReddit,fe51htm,t1_fe4psgj,1578864812.0,Does nothing but make me miserable and tired. And I've been doing it for a year and a half.
boardgames,fe2psmi,t3_ennmf5,1578841593.0,"I have recently gotten super into Arkham horror the card game. I cannot find the miskatonic museum mythos pack  anywhere. Sold out everywhere online, sold out at every local store and even I'm other states near me."
MurderedByWords,fdtftz7,t1_fdtargh,1578716148.0,"Well the trick is you have to actually be good at it to make money. Contrary to many beliefs, it's very easy to pass college and still be woefully unprepared for the challenges of the job. I worked as one for 4 years made decent money but I wasn't up to the challenges and left the field. I plan on returning some day though."
MurderedByWords,fdtdoj9,t1_fdtbsuo,1578715273.0,"While I am bitter, he was being snarky. He was inferring that it was an obvious choice when he has no idea where we were at in life. Also you have no idea what tech was available when I or anyone else was at the time to make the decision."
suicidebywords,fdt1ss7,t1_fdsm052,1578710810.0,I went from 5 years of it to 10 years and counting without. Never bothered me. Can't rate to most of these comments lol
MurderedByWords,fdss91b,t1_fdspyrq,1578707279.0,"Yea, at 30 year old I definitely understand that better at this point. I know I was naive back then, but it has haunted me ever since. The general feeling that people believe I deserve my situation (I do for some other poor decisions not going to lie) because of being too trusting 13 years ago really sucks. 

I appreciate the convo, I hope it gives people a bit of perspective where some of us are coming from and I learned a bit from yours as well."
MurderedByWords,fdsmv40,t1_fdsj8or,1578705293.0,"Yea there's definitely a lack of understanding on both sides. I don't necessarily fully blame them but I just get a bit riled up when I (and many I know) get shit talked because we took the advice of adults who were supposed to be looking out for our best interests. 

The idea of an apprenticeship and working a trade never crossed my mind because ""the only way to be successful is to go to college"" was rammed into my head for 4+ years, but everyone calls me dumb for getting in to debt in the first place when that was what I assumed ""everyone"" did."
wholesomememes,fdsit88,t1_fdsi5gw,1578703563.0,"I mean yea if someone claims those as aiding in the spiritual and emotional meaning or reference for politics that's a bit difference. I'd argue that emotional is not too farfetched though. I have an emotional connection to Harry Potter for instance because I absolutely hated all books until I read it. It got me into reading and I still enjoy it.

I never considered the other things in any of my comments, just entertainment. I only read for entertainment and very occasionally technical stuff which I fucking hate but have to to learn certain things. 

The opposite can be said as well though, I don't give a fuck what kind of deep spiritual emotional political shit you read, it's not going to make me respect or take you seriously."
wholesomememes,fdsi990,t1_fdshtre,1578703256.0,Ya there is a lot of good themes and overall cool stuff going on. Thanks for being cool :)
MurderedByWords,fdshsjn,t1_fdshf3r,1578703001.0,"Yea I was a trusting 17 year old. Did what I was told. I doubt most 17 year olds (2007) are sitting around doing research and cost benefit analysis of popular future options. If you did, good on you but I did what advisors and parents told me was the way to go."

wholesomememes,fdsgf59,t1_fdsg8vr,1578702220.0,Yea! I was listening to a book earlier than literally had me jumping out of my chair in excitement. That's what I crave in entertainment. I know people who would call it trash but I bet what they consume doesn't do that for them. If it does cool I guess but can't expect that from everyone.
wholesomememes,fdsg653,t1_fdsfuwb,1578702055.0,"Judging someone based on their artistic interests is pretentious as fuck. Then again that might be just the kind of people you find interesting, whereas I don't give a shit. I'm fine missing out on this that might be incredible if it doesn't initially inspire me. Journey before destination."
wholesomememes,fdsfmt4,t1_fdrxk3z,1578701671.0,Ya I'm 30 m and still have blanket I use every night since the day I was born. I can not use it and I won't bring it out places typically but I never sleep as well when it's not there lol
wholesomememes,fdsets9,t1_fdrxj0w,1578701089.0,"Right? They inevitably always suggest some pretentious ass shit that would bore me out of my mind. I know what I like and dont like. If you enjoy that, have at you but it's not for me."
wholesomememes,fdself7,t1_fdrzure,1578700924.0,I'm 30 and sleep with a blanket I got the day I was born. It's falling apart now so eventually I'll have to say goodbye but until it literally disintegrates I'll have it. I can sleep without it but it's never as restful.
wholesomememes,fdse1qb,t1_fds2j59,1578700540.0,"Like what? People keep saying shit like this but I can't really fathom what they mean. Like pretentious shit like ""the classics""? Or self help books or some shit? I honestly don't know lol"
wholesomememes,fdsdiis,t1_fds9qok,1578700171.0,Or it bores you out of your mind. I'm not going to waste time on shit I don't enjoy. I'll try something but I'm not going to finish a movie or a show or a book or an album that I am not liking.

MurderedByWords,fdsaz33,t1_fds2j6d,1578698442.0,"Too late for that idiot. College is constantly pushed by adults (when I was in highschool) so that is all some people know as the only option to be ""successful""."
MurderedByWords,fdsac3n,t1_fdrzg5g,1578698008.0,"Yea but not everyone knows about this shit. Boomers pushed college as the only viable option all through highschool , so I thought that was the way to go. Degree in computer science, good grades in all programming classes, couldn't hack it in the industry. I'd have loved to know of other options."

insanepeoplefacebook,fdr34ts,t1_fdqxmk5,1578678824.0,"No not independently. As in we could actually keep it alive. Normal abortions happen early enough that we couldn't even keep them alive if we tried. Therefore it's not a viable person, regardless of the ""potential""."
insanepeoplefacebook,fdqwp7q,t1_fdqwa52,1578675952.0,"I have my personal one which is if you took it out whole from the womb at the time of the abortion, would it reasonably be able to survive. Normal abortions happen before this would be possible, if it's developed enough that it could survive it would be immoral. This can be superceded by concerns for the mother's health. Mother's health is most important, do what you gotta do to save her."

pics,fdko2d2,t1_fdknsq1,1578507587.0,"Yea I've been paying them for 10 years. I think the principle went down like 2k total out of 80k lol. I'm not interested in chasing higher salaries. Dunno why I'm even going on here. The original point I guess is that not everyone gets to retire. Don't worry about it, Thanks for being friendly I guess."
pics,fdkn4z5,t1_fdkmu8w,1578507026.0,"I work full time and have 2 roommates already. Student loans are almost 30% of my income alone. I am working on meal prep. I sometimes care but not usually, I hate society and their money obsession. I know I'll never retire or live long enough for that to matter."

politics,fdir2n6,t1_fdipct9,1578449139.0,"If they would still vote for him just because people are being mean to them, they don't really feel bad and haven't changed at all. If they ""grew a brain"" and then still vote for him in spite, fuck them."
books,fcvh2oy,t1_fcvgr17,1578001944.0,"Lol no problem. Just was commenting because I found it funny how opposite we are which highlights everyone's different reading tastes. Non-fiction is boring as hell to me, which is what I was going for. 

Anyway hope you find something that he enjoys!"
books,fcvgi6f,t1_fcvgaj3,1578001606.0,"I feel as if there may be some confusion. I only read fiction and read zero autobiographies, travel, or history books. I have no interest in non-fiction for learning or even the classics."
books,fcvg3i6,t1_fcveu04,1578001362.0,"Ah I see, due to a possible lack of reading comprehension I kept thinking of challenging as in hard to read, not challenging as in challenge your outlook. I personally don't have any drive or desire to be a leader or like them so not super interested in what they are reading. I get it now though, thanks for taking the time to clarify."
books,fcvdpfm,t1_fcvd9cd,1577999944.0,I know of twilight and have passed it up as not something for me. Was looking for examples and not pretentiousness.
books,fcv2f2r,t1_fcv1ex3,1577993241.0,"No not particularly, nothing that I can think of."
books,fcuwatd,t1_fcu64vy,1577989836.0,Lol I'm the opposite. I won't read any non-fiction because it's boring as fuck
books,fcuw4uv,t1_fcuq8wq,1577989741.0,"What do you even consider ""challenging"" books?

I'm wondering because I'm going to assume they are snoozefests but wanna see for sure"
boardgames,fchmjnm,t1_fcgeqq0,1577651859.0,Very cool how everyone has something for them. That genre has absolutely zero appeal to me but I respect it having seen many comments like this.
ABoringDystopia,fc9fgv2,t1_fc9bp12,1577551903.0,He meant the parent comment you were repsonding to you dense as hell
relationship_advice,fc69fqa,t1_fc62wcb,1577475327.0,Yea that wouldn't be weird. Who is this guy who keeps coming to visit and hasn't even raised me since I was 3? You think a woman who did this to him and him leaving her would think it's great and not be shit talking him and making him out to be a bad guy for leaving her so this kid grows up with some guy not her father visiting for years while her mother fills her with negativity about him? C'mon how would that work out lol

MurderedByWords,fdsac3n,t1_fdrzg5g,1578698008.0,"Yea but not everyone knows about this shit. Boomers pushed college as the only viable option all through highschool , so I thought that was the way to go. Degree in computer science, good grades in all programming classes, couldn't hack it in the industry. I'd have loved to know of other options."
MurderedByWords,fdsa3zp,t1_fdrsyok,1578697858.0,Rather kill myself
boardgames,fds5335,t1_fds4xtx,1578694541.0,I don't know for sure but I just saw them together the other month at PAX unplugged though.

insanepeoplefacebook,fdr34ts,t1_fdqxmk5,1578678824.0,"No not independently. As in we could actually keep it alive. Normal abortions happen early enough that we couldn't even keep them alive if we tried. Therefore it's not a viable person, regardless of the ""potential""."
insanepeoplefacebook,fdqwp7q,t1_fdqwa52,1578675952.0,"I have my personal one which is if you took it out whole from the womb at the time of the abortion, would it reasonably be able to survive. Normal abortions happen before this would be possible, if it's developed enough that it could survive it would be immoral. This can be superceded by concerns for the mother's health. Mother's health is most important, do what you gotta do to save her."

pics,fdko2d2,t1_fdknsq1,1578507587.0,"Yea I've been paying them for 10 years. I think the principle went down like 2k total out of 80k lol. I'm not interested in chasing higher salaries. Dunno why I'm even going on here. The original point I guess is that not everyone gets to retire. Don't worry about it, Thanks for being friendly I guess."
pics,fdkn4z5,t1_fdkmu8w,1578507026.0,"I work full time and have 2 roommates already. Student loans are almost 30% of my income alone. I am working on meal prep. I sometimes care but not usually, I hate society and their money obsession. I know I'll never retire or live long enough for that to matter."
pics,fdklp9j,t1_fdkkmzd,1578506144.0,"Yea no shit. I have literally $4.11, pretty sure that isn't what doing things right looks like lol"
pics,fdk94xx,t1_fdk5hq9,1578498889.0,Lol retiring. I'll be working till I die or just retire myself permanently at like 55. Pretty much my only options
pics,fdk81uo,t1_fdjujfp,1578498198.0,Lol acting like everyone just has 2k sitting around
politics,fdir2n6,t1_fdipct9,1578449139.0,"If they would still vote for him just because people are being mean to them, they don't really feel bad and haven't changed at all. If they ""grew a brain"" and then still vote for him in spite, fuck them."
books,fcvh2oy,t1_fcvgr17,1578001944.0,"Lol no problem. Just was commenting because I found it funny how opposite we are which highlights everyone's different reading tastes. Non-fiction is boring as hell to me, which is what I was going for. 

Anyway hope you find something that he enjoys!"
books,fcvgi6f,t1_fcvgaj3,1578001606.0,"I feel as if there may be some confusion. I only read fiction and read zero autobiographies, travel, or history books. I have no interest in non-fiction for learning or even the classics."
books,fcvg3i6,t1_fcveu04,1578001362.0,"Ah I see, due to a possible lack of reading comprehension I kept thinking of challenging as in hard to read, not challenging as in challenge your outlook. I personally don't have any drive or desire to be a leader or like them so not super interested in what they are reading. I get it now though, thanks for taking the time to clarify."
books,fcvdpfm,t1_fcvd9cd,1577999944.0,I know of twilight and have passed it up as not something for me. Was looking for examples and not pretentiousness.
books,fcv2f2r,t1_fcv1ex3,1577993241.0,"No not particularly, nothing that I can think of."
books,fcuwatd,t1_fcu64vy,1577989836.0,Lol I'm the opposite. I won't read any non-fiction because it's boring as fuck
books,fcuw4uv,t1_fcuq8wq,1577989741.0,"What do you even consider ""challenging"" books?

I'm wondering because I'm going to assume they are snoozefests but wanna see for sure"
boardgames,fchmjnm,t1_fcgeqq0,1577651859.0,Very cool how everyone has something for them. That genre has absolutely zero appeal to me but I respect it having seen many comments like this.
ABoringDystopia,fc9fgv2,t1_fc9bp12,1577551903.0,He meant the parent comment you were repsonding to you dense as hell
relationship_advice,fc69fqa,t1_fc62wcb,1577475327.0,Yea that wouldn't be weird. Who is this guy who keeps coming to visit and hasn't even raised me since I was 3? You think a woman who did this to him and him leaving her would think it's great and not be shit talking him and making him out to be a bad guy for leaving her so this kid grows up with some guy not her father visiting for years while her mother fills her with negativity about him? C'mon how would that work out lol
atheism,fbwb8au,t1_fbvmffr,1577145375.0,Ya be kind/polite to someone telling you that you are literally why your family is dead. Right. He's literally severely hurting him but he should be thankful? Get out of here with that shit
