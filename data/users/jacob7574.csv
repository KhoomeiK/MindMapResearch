ExpectationVsReality,ff8m1j8,t3_es0bf1,1579685180.0,I think your version looks much better. It's nice and clean looking. The other one makes me irrationally angry. Great job!
velvethippos,ff8l2ou,t3_es2pvp,1579683694.0,This picture is so cool my phone froze. She looks awesome in her glasses.
ComplimentMePlease,ff6eq7k,t3_erv7fn,1579625590.0,"You are beautiful. If this is what it takes for you to see you're true beauty, rock that shit. You look like a beautiful Elven warrior. You look like a very kind person. Your eyes shine like brilliant sapphires, they are immensely captivating. I hope one day you can look into those stunning eyes and recognize the beauty others see in you. Things will get better, hang in there."
ComplimentMePlease,ff4nf3a,t3_erm8yv,1579567852.0,"You are beautiful, even on your off days. You look absolutely stunning in this picture. I feel your pain with the added mental burden. It's a lot easier when you don't walk the path alone. For me meds helped a ton. If that's not your thing at least find someone to talk to, so you can vent the ugly crap inside. Then that person can show you that you're just tripping and make that little voice shut the hell up. Keep your head up, you got this shit! Now get out there and dazzle the hell outta everyone with them big, beautiful brown eyes! You're beautiful and you matter!"
ComplimentMePlease,ff2rmqu,t3_er45q2,1579521058.0,"This is a very nice picture of you, you're hella cute. I hope you find the strength to overcome and work through those insecurities whatever they may be. Good luck in the future. We're all rooting for you. You got this!"
RetroNickelodeon,ff1sjtk,t3_er1t52,1579485227.0,Fuzzy Wuzzy was bear. Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair. Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't really fuzzy was he? Finally I remember where that came from. It's been messing with me for years!

happy,fdkkqd5,t3_eltzc7,1578505607.0,"This is a great picture of you. You look genuinely happy, you can see the smile in your eyes. That shirt looks great on you. Everybody needs a happy shirt, especially a comfy oversized one. Sometimes you can find the best stuff in thrift shops, the whole ""one man's trash is another man's treasure""."

AnimalsBeingBros,fdcxoax,t3_ekkr8n,1578287370.0,"I had a similar experience. At my old apartment there was this super cool black cat who would always come by and hang out for a while. She looked well fed and taken care of so I figured she belonged to someone local. Cats are cool. I've always heard cats pick their people, you confirmed this. Congrats on the new buddy."
velvethippos,fdcwqeu,t1_fdcw57n,1578286552.0,Aww he's still a pup (imo a dog could be 15 and still be a pup. Lol) He looks like a giant teddy bear. Please give him a big hug and a treat for me.

ComplimentMePlease,fcvrfpu,t3_ej5ntj,1578008413.0,"You are naturally beautiful. You don't need all these bullshit Snapchat filters to make you pretty. You  are geprgiuous to make the rest of us stutter over our word's. Don't doubt yourself, you have so much more potential than you know. I hope you find your meaning in life."
hotones,fcvqhbv,t1_fcvnem9,1578007803.0,"I really don't understand some people's  mindset. I mean, I'm all about the golden rule ""Treat others as you'd like to be treated."" (Or something along those lines.)  I understand these guys are under pressure to get a certain amount of deliveris in a set amount of time, but dude, come on. People spent good money on a product they hope is delivered in full (not shattered into a million pieces.) ""Oh it's ok they like pain anyway."" Bullshit. Yeah I like the spicy pain, not the loaded with shards of glass pain. Imagine: you eat the spiciest sauce, only to have it left by the stinging agony that is your butthole. The last line of defense you have. Only to have it succumb to the agony the agony that is the next level."
stevenuniverse,fcvnnk4,t3_disp4a,1578006008.0,"It looks good. You're off to a good start. Just keep practicing when you can and you'll be an excellent artist before you know it. Keep in mind we are our own worst critics. Just keep at it and soon you'll blow yourself away and that little doubtful voice will shut the hell up. That inner monologue is a bitch and nothing is ever good enough to satisfy the monster that is self doubt. You're awesome, you matter and you do awesome work. Don't let the little self win. You're bigger than that, you're stronger than that. You got this! Now get out there and brighten theirs dark world with your awesome art. Shine on you crazy diamond and spiral out, keep going. Keep up sharing that sweet, sweet artwork. Best of luck to you in the future. You're not alone!"
hotones,fcu33ca,t3_eixqvt,1577971086.0,I've read stories of shipping accidents and apparently the company is pretty cool with replacements. I don't know about international support. Wouldn't hurt to contact them and let them know about the mishap and maybe they'll reimburse or ship new. Sorry for your loss I hope you have better luck in the future.

Dude (sorry, from California so I call everyone dude. EVERYONE.) Anyway, dude, I know how you feel. ""Such a happy time of year"" FUCK YOU! HUMBUG! I was gonna write my own bitter post about fuck the holidays and happiness. I saw this and had to comment. If you don't see this that's ok, just know you're not alone in the fuck the holiday spirit. I hope things get better for both of us. Maybe next year. Good luck in the future friend, I  hope it gets easier."
