In soulsborne, however, bloodborne takes the cake."

saltierthancrait,ffaadgt,t1_ff8e0sb,1579731005.0,I feel like the sequel trilogy originally started like a standalone movie idea (cuz lets be real the movies are not coherent enough to actually be considered a trilogy) but then had nostalgia and SJW culture shoehorned in to try to bank on peoples memories and further push kathleen kennedys toxic feminism
saltierthancrait,ffa9ki5,t1_ff9plgi,1579730544.0,"The worst part is they tried, and horribly failed, to give it an explanation with the force dyad bullshit. Like if you can't properly explain what's going on or need to write another fucking comic or book or visual novel to explain ANOTHER movie because the movie didn't do any of it, why even bother adding it? For more fucking novel sales? Just make a good goddamn movie so you don't shit on your own franchise and its fans"
PrequelMemes,ffa0wui,t1_ff9xz2d,1579725650.0,Oh shit I didn't even think about that yet.. The more I think about this movie the worse it gets. At least we can pretend the sequels aren't canon and still have the intended ending of the OT.
PrequelMemes,ff9svcs,t1_ff9g099,1579720518.0,"I watched it with a friend who already saw it (he wanted to see my reactions to the shitshow) and when i saw the death star with glass still intact and sheev his fucking chair still there I pointed it out and we both just laughed out loud. Then again WHEN A FUCKING DOOR STILL WORKED.

Also when that sochi or kochi or whatever his ship is JUST SITTING THERE. in 30 years nobody scrapped it? It didn't erode? It still fucking works perfectly?

I could go on and on, fuck this movie. Worse than Game of Thrones season 8. At least GoT s8 was somewhat of a fun spectacle to watch besides the bad writing, while in ROS everything goes by so fast you have no clue what's happening and can't process anything."
PrequelMemes,ff9apij,t1_ff99rj6,1579708681.0,"I spoiled myself and watched it yesterday in cinema (cinema is cheaper here on Tuesday, 6 bucks for a movie).

Went in with low expectations and was still absolutely stunned at how bad it is. Facepalmed and cringed all the way through. Had a great laugh at some of the horribly written scenes tho.

depression,fer2e56,t3_eq7hc5,1579348834.0,"So sorry for your loss... Lost my dog 2 years ago, heard I almost (god bless my veterinarian sister) lost my own baby cat thursday. I didn't wanna think about how I would've felt if my girl just died unexpectedly so I can't imagine the pain you're going through...   


Losing a pet is definitely like losing a family member, at least in my experience it is. Now, as for your dog, if they keep showing signs of depression you might want to get a new buddy for them. It's what we had to do with our dog that passed 2 years ago when she lost her old buddy about 10 years ago.   


As for yourself, try to find comfort and solace in the fact that you gave your kitty a life worth living. A beautiful life full of love and snacks. If you keep struggling then maybe you need a new cat buddy too. I know I would..."
