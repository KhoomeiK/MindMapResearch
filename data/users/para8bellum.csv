So why do you assume ""women don't"" negotiate? And why do you assume gender discrimination is not an issue?"

We call it black ice, because it's transparent and matches the color of the black, asphalt road pavement.

Check out [Lakes and Legends Brewing](https://lakesandlegends.com/) near downtown. It's a great local spot for beer, and a good place to meet people.

Probably best to get [hockey tickets](https://www.nhl.com/wild) in advance online.

Minneapolis,fdfl7hh,t1_fdfetm4,1578364282.0,"I find the centrism insufferable with respect to the editorial board's opinion pieces and editorial direction. Like that time they made the subjective decision to write a [sympathetic article on the North Minneapolis slumlord](http://strib.mn/342UMZd). Or the opinion piece on conditions on Metro trains. 

And even though I often disagree with the board's opinions/tone/focus, I don't always. And I still respect their reporting of the news, which is a separate matter and subject to ideas of journalistic integrity/ethics. I don't think there's a great deal of criticism to be made about the STrib with regard to their adherence to fact-based reporting, which is why I was asking what u/medathon meant with their comment about inaccuracies in reporting on his field. Maybe I'm mistaken on that belief."
Minneapolis,fdf56vy,t1_fdf3wsm,1578353568.0,"Can I ask what you mean by that? I'd be really curious to see what they reported, and how you found it didn't add up. 

I have also come close to pulling the plug based on reporting I felt was dubious. Not to mention the editorial board is insufferably centrist and suburban. I try to remember one article or one reporter is just that and not representative of the entire value the whole paper, and I stick it out and find enough other good articles to make it seem worth the cost."
Minneapolis,fdes44l,t1_fdeo6gt,1578345453.0,"Agreed, but sadly even subscription fees aren't enough to cover operating costs, so advertising is still critical for funding. 

Other publications, like [MinnPost](https://www.minnpost.com/), are largely ad-free and try to cover all their costs through donations. But they have a much smaller staff, and their operating costs are lower because they don't print. 

MinnPost is actually a really great alternative to STrib for state political coverage. But the STrib really nails the local and variety reporting."
Minneapolis,fdemi52,t1_fde5fvj,1578342151.0,"Just a quick PSA that a digital subscription to the STrib is less than a Netflix subscription, and the subscription fee goes to support local journalism and reporting. 

If we only let advertising pay for journalism, then it's hard for journalists to publish pieces that might damage the reputation of the capitalists who pay the paper for the ads. 

[And it's even worse](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/05/study-when-local-newspaper-close-city-bond-finances-suffer/561422/) if the paper folds altogether.

Not trying to shame you specifically, because I understand we all have different financial situations, just using your comment as a springboard for others who may jump in to complain about paywalls. Reporters have to eat too!"
