It's not silly at all - a lot of times you just need to articulate how you feel and get it outside of your head. When I did it and started listening to myself, for some reason it didn't seem so bad anymore."
ABA,ffsw6h1,t3_ev0hv8,1580194921.0,Have you mentioned any of this to your supervisor? Basically they're billing for a service that they aren't receiving (or aren't receiving enough of). That's very frustrating and I know exactly how you feel.

Too many 'fuck-its' have led me to a desensitization of the ""sting"" of giving up and not reaching my goal, and it becomes a hard cycle to break."

I recently started seeing a therapist who told me I need to try to combat ""all or nothing"" mindset. But the only times I've been successful with diets are when I'm completely obsessed and consumed by it. Just wanted to thank you for describing your struggle in such a way that I can explain it to my therapist."
