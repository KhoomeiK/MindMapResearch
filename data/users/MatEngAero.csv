metallurgy,ff6kbqp,t3_erxzlg,1579629033.0,"Apply to those positions anyway, you are more than qualified for those types of jobs.

I would recommend applying to small companies as they are more likely to hire those without direct job experience.

If you have ANY job experience be sure to put it on your resume, engineering is more than tech work, there’s ALOT of soft skills needed. Customer relations, project management, budgeting are all great things to put on there as well.

Aerospace is seeing a lot of turmoil and turnover right now which makes it easy to work up the corporate ladder, check out the aerospace companies that appeal to you and hit up all jobs that you even remotely qualify for.

Also keep in mind the positions put on the internet do not tell the full tale of a job so don’t discount a position if it doesn’t sound exactly up your alley. There may be more to it and the only way to find out is to talk to them.

If you want to ‘get a foot in the door’ then you may have to bite the bullet for a little and take a job that’s not your bag but will get you to the next step"
