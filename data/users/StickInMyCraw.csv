Obviously today there is a more unified ""white culture"" in America, but that is a more recent phenomenon in the grand scheme of things.

And the history of whiteness leaves out the non-white parts of American culture. Just because the Klan toned down its anti-Catholic rhetoric doesn't mean that they stopped with their white supremacist rhetoric. If 40% of the country is excluded from the melting pot, that's not a melting pot.

I live in one of the most segregated cities in America. This did not start in the fucking 90s. It is the result of a continuous sequence of government policies aimed at dividing people by ethnicity. Get out of your monocultural bubble and you'll realize how diverse this country is. Chinatowns did not spring up in the 90s. Koreatown in LA and the Polish quarter in Chicago are not a product of the 90s. The Amish did not spring from the forest in the 90s.

\>  Timing.  Timing and the unique change that corresponds to the time.  Correlation may not *prove* causation, but nor does it *preclude* it as you are trying to imply.

My point is there is no correlation. We were never a melting pot. Ask a historian and they will tell you that that is a fiction. We've always been a salad bowl, just ask the government that persistently segregated us all this time.

\>  Literally everything you've provided to ""disprove"" my claims has only bolstered them.

Your claim is that America was historically a melting pot and now it is not. I'm showing you how it has always been more of a salad bowl. You're now trying to shift the goalposts and claim that you meant the US was making progress towards being more integrated, but that's not your initial assertion."

The implication being you think it's okay to use Jew as an insult towards people who aren't Jewish.

Ask a gay person if they think your use of their identity as an insult is light-hearted. Ask a mentally disabled person if they think your use of their identity as an insult is light-hearted. Ask a Jewish person if they think your use of their identity as an insult is light-hearted. You don't get to decide that for someone else."

Which you are claiming is early 2010s?

Also obviously not true. African Americans and white people had separate churches, schools, neighborhoods, dialects, etc. from time immemorial.

\>  Court cases from decades before the time period in question aren't particularly relevant here.

Your whole claim is that America was mono-cultural and assimilated different cultures up until the 2010s. Meanwhile in the real world, the state was mandating segregation of cultures and forbade intermarriage between them. Loving v Virginia is relevant because it blows a giant hole in your retcon history.

\>   Provide a more probable cause, then.  If your critique is ""I disagree""  but you provide no countering cause then your critique can be ignored.

You have offered zero evidence for the cause of this breakdown in race relations. Your baseless assertion is not true until disproven, you have to do the work of making your case. And you have not offered one scrap of evidence. It's actually very possible to critique an assertion without offering an alternative. If you told me your skin is blue, I don't have to make the case that I know what color your skin really is to make the case that it's definitely not blue. I have my own thoughts on the causes of those poll results in recent years, but that's not the point of this discussion.

\> Because we're talking about *now*.

We're not though. Your whole thing is that you think America has always been a melting pot until recently. I'm showing how completely ridiculous and ahistorical that is."

UpliftingNews,fffl4if,t1_fffjgwz,1579886311.0,And what's your reasoning for not using Jew as an insult?
Economics,fffl2i8,t1_fffj0j5,1579886278.0,The target population here is homeless people. The cash they have on them is going to be their total savings anyway. And no credit card company is going to sign off on them.

Tell that to Chinatowns that have existed since the 19th century. Tell that to the Polish quarter in Chicago where mass, shops, advertisements, street signs, etc. have been in Polish since the Poles first immigrated. Tell that to African American culture that has been distinct since time immemorial. Tell that to the Amish and Mennonite communities that have lived here for over a century and speak German as a first language and run their own parallel economy and towns all across the country. Tell that to the vicious sectarian violence between Catholics and Protestants throughout most of US history.

And again, if America championed the idea of assimilation and integration, why would marriage between races have been a criminal violation for most of its history? Why would we have had segregated schools and redlining to keep the cultures separate? The truth is that America is a salad bowl and always has been. The ""melting pot"" is a myth, as a historian will tell you.

Again, if you've never read a history book and never left a rural county in Idaho, I can see how you'd have this impression that America is mono-cultural.

\>  addressing my ***actual, non-partisan numbers*** that disprove all of your assertions

Yeah, the fact that race relations have gotten worse in recent years means that Love v Virginia didn't happen. Right. What your links demonstrate, accurately, is that in recent years race relations have gotten worse. That's not causal proof, which what I'm disputing.

Your numbers don't say anything about America's history. They reaffirm that progress is not linear. We take steps forward and we take steps back. But US history is a consistent story of different cultural groups co-existing under one polity. America's success is the success story of multiculturalism. America is the reason the world knows multiculturalism works."

This is ridiculous. The government literally forbid interracial marriage until the late 60s. That is explicitly barring the ingredients of the pot from ""melting."" JFK was seen as unelectable (and barely scraped by in 1960) because of the divisiveness between Catholics and Protestants. If you go to any big American city today you'll find neighborhoods where the signage and advertisements are all in another language than English and that has always been the case. If you closed your eyes on the subway the only way you'd know you were in America isn't that you hear English, but that you hear such a diversity of languages being spoken and few places on earth have the incredible diversity that America has.

Your retconning of American cultural history would be more convincing if it wasn't so immediately disprovable. Have you never stepped foot outside a fucking homestead? The country is incredibly diverse and always has been. That is one of its defining characteristics and greatest strengths."
