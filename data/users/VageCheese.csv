NYU students taking classes about the Simpsons and shit. I'm not talking about the foreign students taking advanced biochem or Econ  majors or  whatever, i mean like they know its expensive and ""choose"" bullshit classes. I mean some of these classes cost like hundred of dollars per session and they sleep through it, or pick joke classes. If anything, college students learn to be an adult and be accountable but too many are still living in a mindset of mommy and daddy finances and goofing off, then hopping on to legitimate cases where the systems failed them."
