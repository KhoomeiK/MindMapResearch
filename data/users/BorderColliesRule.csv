Weighing about 3,500 lb (1,587.6 kg), the Ultravan could cruise at 60 mph (97 km/h) and return fuel economy in the range of 15–20 mpg‑US (16–12 L/100 km; 18–24 mpg‑imp).*

Writer Lin Yutang called Zhang ""the most colorful, legendary, medieval, and unashamed ruler of modern China"". Former Emperor Puyi remembered Zhang as ""a universally detested monster"" whose ugly, bloated face was ""tinged with the livid hue induced by heavy opium smoking"". A brutal man, Zhang was notorious for his hobby of splitting the skulls of prisoners with his sword, which he called ""smashing melons"". He loved to boast about the size of his penis, which become part of his legend. He was nicknamed ""General Eighty-Six"" as his penis when erect was said to measure up to a pile of 86 Mexican silver dollars.[9] He kept some 30 to 50 concubines of different nationalities, who were given numbers since he could not remember their names nor speak their language. He was free with his gifts, lavishly squandering money and concubines on superiors and friends. As a result, his commanders were very loyal to him, contributing to his military success.*

I have a pet theory along these same lines; ie, internal power struggle within Iran and getting rid of Soleimani via the US was an end-goal. No Americans or allies were killed during the Iranian response and allegedly they were warned by the Iranians prior to launch.
