It plays from a bird's-eye perspective with an unforgiving combat style that forces you to time attacks, conserve stamina and anticipate the enemy's moves.

4. Cultivate hatred for your interrogator so you don't fall into his traps and start talking.

Don't let them make you think that silence will only make things worse. They will lie and trick you into confessing and if they had their own way, they wouldn't mind putting their hands on you either."

gamingsuggestions,fc2ir3r,t3_eftijb,1577362399.0,"also try Green Hell, it's more of a psychological horror.

Oh, and Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead if you're interested in super old-school survival. It's a big influence of Project Zomboid too!"
gamingsuggestions,fc2dbx5,t3_eftijb,1577353537.0,"The Long Dark? It's more of a hardcore survival type where the cold is your biggest enemy, managing clothing wetness and staying out of the wind on top of managing hunger, thirst, sickness ect. It's more of a walking simulator up until you hear the howling of hungry wolves or weather playing up on you though.

edit: if you like a scary survival type, Darkwood should suit you. You have to collect supplies, weapons and stuff in preparation for the night cycles, where the forest actively tries to murder your face off in the scariest way possible; by playing with your imagination and building dread as you hide in a dark corner waiting for the morning. scary shit imo"

ftlgame,fc2c7et,t1_fc0ayae,1577351575.0,"I was messing around with cheatengine on the mind control system before. Turns out if you put it onto level 4 and beyond, you can permanently mind-control an enemy crewmember until they die or you ftl jump, but they deal extremely low system and combat damage. it's like a ""mark for death"" system at that point"
AskReddit,fbxrool,t3_eetf7i,1577198648.0,"Way back in primary school, they had metal gates for the toilet block. I had a padlock from the garage back at home.

Unfortunately the staff had boltcutters, obviously prepared for that situation. I think there was maybe 3 or 4 kids in there going nuts, crying and shit before they cut the lock. I would've felt bad for them if I didn't hate almost everyone in that school lmao"
