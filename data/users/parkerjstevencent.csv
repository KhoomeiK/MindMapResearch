I personally don’t know why certain ambient music turns me on and why some does not but it is the only music I can listen to when I work. If I’m feeling anxious it really helps me to calm down and center myself. I used to like ambient with percussion but now I seek ambient without or if it has it in it, it must be very tastefully done."
