depression,ff4lju8,t1_ff4lhrp,1579566541.0,What exactly do you mean? Sorry I don't understand
dxm,ff4jeml,t1_fdcmshe,1579565041.0,"Just drink cough syrup lol. After tripping over 100 times on dxm it's pretty easy to get a few bottles down at once. But makes sure to brush your teeth after it, my teeth went all fucked up after drinking around 2-3 bottles daily for about 6months."
nutmeg,ff4j621,t3_erhnbx,1579564878.0,"If you think you could handle it, try 50 Grams of fresh nutmeg with 1 Gram of DXM. Smoke weed throughout the experience."
depression,ff4iupq,t3_ererwo,1579564663.0,"I understand. I've been a drug addict for 6 years now. Or as my family likes to call me a ""junkie"" lol. I've tried committing suicide a few times but to no success. I've been into rehabs, psyh wards etc. I made a choice a long time ago, that I wasn't going to get better. That I was going to pursue a life of drugs and die an early age. Because deep down, I know il never be happy. I've never had friends, never had a gf etc. I know that il probably overdose again sometime soon and I hope I don't wake up. I'm probably not fit to be giving any advice, but il go ahead anyway. If you want to be happy, it starts with yourself. You, and only you. You have to accept that first. 2nd, if you want to beat depression, you can't just sit around doing the same thing day in day out and expect a change. Start going to the gym, eating well, drinkin 2-3L of water a day. Become healthy. Healthy body = Healthy mind. It sounds cliche but once upon a time it worked for me. If it's you're job and financial situation making you depressed, I'm not exactly sure what to tell you. Those types of things usually take a bit of time and effort in order to see improvement ( maybe you want to quit and move somewhere else, im not sure just having a guess). Right when you wake up in the morning, stretch then go for a little jog. No using your cellphone or laying around in bed watching videos. When you get back, make a healthy breakfast and tell yourself this. I love myself. I love who I am. Other people's opinions don't define who I am. I accept the things I cannot change. I am greatful to be alive, to have food on my plate and a roof over my head. Be thankful and mindful of the little things in life we usually take for granted. Cut off all toxic friends/relationships. You don't need to tell them why, if it benefits you then you don't need to explain yourself at all. Depression isn't easy to get through man and i know where you're at. The real answer is time. Set yourself a goal and don't stop until you get there. Even if you don't achieve them, the pursuit will get you to places you never thought were possible. Sorry if this was just useless rambling. But, I do wish you overcome your battles. Keep your head up and don't give up in life, I believe in you. üëä"
FortniteCompetitive,fepo5iq,t3_eq6am8,1579325812.0,""" I have a Bog Pot for u bro"""
depression,fef0dn2,t3_eojiuf,1579045228.0,"I'm the same. But usually I think like that in the moment. Il think of something to say then my brain will be like "" No dont say that, they will think you're weird"" then I start overthinking everything until I end up sitting there Awkwardly and not saying anything lol. Ahh the struggles man."
nutmeg,fdqr30d,t3_emrc4t,1578673063.0,"I usually use a coffe grinder and 30 - 50 g nutmeg. Grind into a fine powder, then il make a protein shake and take a mouthful of nutmeg powder and swallow. Takes about 5 - 6 tablespoons to get down but you can hardly taste it."
nutmeg,fdp1q1t,t1_fdp0dox,1578617915.0,"Nothing really happened lol. Besides a bit of a headache and yuck taste in your mouth, It really didn't do too much. I've tried smoking it in a joint, out of a bong etc and all have the same effect. Not worth it imo. Nutmeg oil has been the best for me."
depression,fdmgb4z,t3_em30j6,1578548928.0,"I'm in the same boat as you man. I'm 19,never had a girlfriend either. I was addicted to oxycontin and oxycodone when I was 15. I spent the rest of the 3-4years abusing every type of drug I could get my hands on. Its pushed my family away, friends, lost my job etc. Been into a couple of rehabs where I was forced to take anti psychotic meds that made me worse. I just have this feeling that even if I were to achieve my life long goals, I still wouldn't be happy with everything in life. I know you can get through it man. Sometimes its just depressing when everyone else is doing this and that with their boyfriend /girlfriend and you're sitting at home doing nothing feeling like a loser lol."
dxm,fdcojmi,t1_fdcnytb,1578280070.0,"Yeah man. I was seeing deaceased family members and having full conversations. Tried reaching for water that wasn't there and my hand would go through it. Depth perception was very bad, went to open my door and smacked my head on it very hard, had no idea I was 1cm away from it. I couldn't walk, I could hardly talk. I made no sense. I was hallucinating bugs, people, objects and was seeing weird glowing shapes all over ( exactly like lsd) although the texture resembled a grocery bag lol . Music sounded so distorted and evil lol. Just a quick lil write up, there was so much going on whilst tripping I genuinely thought I had fried my brain forever lol. Sorry for the shit explanation im going to write an actual detailed trip report on this experience"
nutmeg,fdcnw7t,t3_ej7exx,1578279590.0,"Hey there. Ive never been a mod, I'm actually pretty new to reddit. I've got alot of experience with nutmeg. I've done it over 100+ times. I've tried seeds, oil, pre ground, fresh, smoking etc. Also, I've done nutmeg with alot of other drugs so Id say I'm well informed üëç"
dxm,fdcndix,t1_fdcmsio,1578279212.0,"Damn man, that's pretty trippy. I forgot to mention I took 500mg dramamine along with 2G DXM and was smoking weed throughout until I literally couldn't comprehend anything anymore. I weigh about 80kg not sure what that is in pounds. I was thinking about writing a trip report about it lol"
nutmeg,fcrdm7x,t1_fcmjvdn,1577900406.0,Lol that's an exaggeration. Maybe after a few years of monthly abuse but not in moderation.
nutmeg,fclvcf4,t1_fclv9m9,1577757366.0,Yep. I've done alot of dph and dramamine too. You described it perfectly man.
nutmeg,fclud1w,t1_fcltsjx,1577756680.0,"Usually this combo is more intense than acid for me, so it's pretty crazy visual and mental wise. Things start warping and my vision gets very shaky. Imagine you're holding a camera and running with it. Whatever the camera records, is what my vision feels like if that makes any sense to you. Depth perception changes, I remember going to reach for something in my closet and then smashing my head against the door ( didn't realise I was so close to it). Things appear different, everything has a weird glowing tint to it. Mentally, I can't talk nor do I make sense. I can hardly walk while on the combo either. I've had full blown hallucinations of dead family members /friends. I've had conversations with them, only to turn around after a few minutes to realise theyre not there. It's funny thinking about it sober but when you're tripping you truly believe they are there and don't even question it until they pull a Houdini on you. I've hallucinated water bottles, went to grab it and my hand went straight through it but I could still see it. Alot of really confusing mental tricks. Sorry for the long paragraph, theres so many visuals it would take me a whole book to describe them to you."
nutmeg,fcltjd9,t1_fcltahi,1577756109.0,"It was awesome. Usually feel a slight weed high after 2-3hrs. Eyes start getting red, my outlook on life changes slowly. Music sounds amazing at about 4-5hrs in. Then the rest is a blur for me, I usually end up relaxing and playing xbox and listening to music/smoking some bud. Really nice and relaxing if you've got nothing to do and just having a quiet night inside lol"
nutmeg,fclr72y,t1_fclqmwy,1577754492.0,"Hmm it's hard to say. First off, thinking clearly is hard. Sometimes I stutter when I speak. It's like I know exactly what I want to say, but it's almost like what comes out of my mouth has no connection to my thoughts if that makes sense to you. I'm usually pretty depressed and go days / weeks without speaking to people. I think this may be from all of my drug abuse. Not too sure what else. Physically I feel fine. Haven't had any gut issues, liver issues etc. Pretty much Just messes me up mentally but I know if I continue using nutmeg daily then eventually the physical side of things will catch up to me."
nutmeg,fclq364,t3_ehrrzl,1577753722.0,"I've been using 50 grams fresh nutmeg everyday for about 6 months. Before I had a tolerance, the first effects would usually become noticeable 3 hours after ingestion. Im not too sure how to describe it. Feels like a weed high at first, but I usually don't notice it too much because nutmeg slowly creeps up on me. By the 4th hour, I'm definitely feeling altered. My outlook on life seems ""different"". Im alot more relaxed. Music sounds great, I get super red eyes and have uncureable munchies. Dry mouth can be bad. Sorry if this wasn't much help, I'm new to reddit lol."
nutmeg,fclonoi,t3_ehbjta,1577752737.0,"5 grams isn't enough. My first time I did 25g, I weigh 75kg. I usually just buy the whole nuts from a supermarket, use a coffee grinder to grind into a find powder. Then, I just grab a bottle of water, a bowl and spoon and take a swig, chuck the nutmeg in your mouth then swallow and repeat."
