politics,ff293py,t3_er1veo,1579497431.0,"My mother passed away from cancer but the treatment, and the quality of it, that she received was entirely covered through the Canadian health care system. Chemo pills that would’ve cost thousands of dollars only cost us $2 per prescription; the pharmacy dispensing fee. These were then refunded to us. When she needed the ambulance, it would’ve cost $4000+ but we paid nothing. When we wanted to change hospitals, they gave us in depth knowledge of every hospital in the region and helped us choose which would suit her better. (My mom was able to get regular treatment at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, one of the top 5 cancer research centres in the world. Of course there was no ridiculous waiting time) When it was too difficult for her to go to the hospitals to receive some specific types of care, we had doctors and nurse come to our HOUSE. Again this was all free of charge. When she was taking her final breaths in palliative care, we were treated with the utmost respect and we are 100% satisfied with our experience. 

My dad currently works a cash job but is slowly switching over to working in an actual registered company because he wants to pay more in taxes “to pay back” for the care that my mom received. If that doesn’t tell you how much we value the Canadian health care system, I don’t know what else you need to hear to believe that our healthcare system is satisfying for so many Canadians.

Edit: also can’t forget that my dad had emergency appendectomy 10mins upon arrival at the hospital. The wait time, that so many Americans use as reason, is actually not that crazy. Of course your wait time depends on how severe your case is but let’s be honest, do Americans not have any wait times?"

changemyview,fewma8m,t3_eqoopv,1579414455.0,"If we lived in a perfect world, I would definitely say “yes I agree”, but we don’t. Even with a general province-wide standard for education there’s a HUGE disparity between what is actually taught, and how efficient they are, in schools that can literally be right next door. If you aren’t willing to shell out the cash to pay for a certification that can save or take a life, you should not be eligible. Let’s face it, even if you ace a test you probably don’t remember the content in the future anyway, it’ll be the exact same for CPR certs but the difference is that messing up can make you a murderer. 

You also have to take into account that most people are not mentally capable of using these skills even if they are not trained. I’ve been in recert classes where a woman who had her certification for many years suddenly went into an extreme panic attack just by mentioning “CPR”. If someone who was willing to pay over $100 discovered IN CLASS that she was no longer capable, think of how many parent complaints you’d receive by forcing every child to learn it."

I’m getting off the bus thinking “I’m such a good tourist, I validated my 7 day pass 5 days ago at the train station in termini cause that’s where the guides told me to validate it”. Yeah those only validate the train passes, not the busses. Obviously I get stopped and I knew there was no way I’m not gonna get a fine since I read that tourists do this often so they don’t buy it anymore. Im about to cry but then they realized that the ticket validation machine on that particular bus was broken so they just let me go. I think it also helped that I was a solo little 19 year old Asian girl who looked 15. Looking back gives me chills though, I was really out there taking the bus for 5 whole days without a validated pass."

AskReddit,fej2dw1,t3_ep9ur1,1579154353.0,"I’m late but I have the memory of an ISIS beheading burned into my memory. I think I was like 15 and came across a viral video on Facebook of all places. There were like 5 men with their faces covered, all holding huge automatic guns and they had a women kneeling between them with a black cloth bag on her head. They ripped off the bag, grabbed her by the hair, and started sawing at her neck. She didn’t seem to be making any sound cause she never opened her mouth but it was also on silent so I don’t know. I tried closing my tab but you know how sometimes your computer freezes but the video keeps playing until it closes completely? I ended up watching these men basically hold up her head like Medusa before it finally got off my screen. I’ve never seen so much blood before but somehow I don’t think I was traumatized by definition, it was shocking yes but I forgot about it until now. I’m pretty sure I was in shock cause I couldn’t get myself to physically get away from the sight but I’m definitely more careful cautious about what I look for online."

The kid clearly needs some tough love. Having a learning disability does not make every person a dependent cripple, And judging by how OP gave the kid choices “go to college or work” shows that he’s probably capable of both. I’m betting that OP would have financially supported the college decision too since they’ve got the financial means to. At 20 the son is now an adult and that means you’ve got to act that way, he needs to understand he is not a trust fund baby and will not be treated like so. His mother not receiving rent may have been her own decision but the fact that they can’t have alcohol in the house without him touching it shows that he probably won’t  have the self control to handle himself at his own wedding, where he wants copious amounts of it."
