Recommended to you, track everything, and round down if you are unsure. Find the macro profile that works for you, and try to stick with it.  For me it was 50 / 30 / 20 Carbs protein fat. I needed higher carbs than most recommended due to the cardio. As soon as you take this seriously, you'll be amazed at how fast you grow and your strength will come with that.
