BABYMETAL,ffbqqee,t1_ff83lxx,1579778923.0,"Don't forget that music is the realm Yui has the most on the job experience with. 

Sure she did some acting, modeling and advertising work. But she has 8 years in music, including international touring, and a writing credit on an internationally sold album. While I'm sure she could go into whatever she wanted, her resume best supports music. So if she does go into music, it wouldn't just be for a quick buck. She she has more experience than many formally trained/educated adults getting into that industry and Amuse most likely keeps that in mind."
BABYMETAL,ffbqizq,t1_ffag6wn,1579778658.0,"I think the Yui fans are loudest because they've experienced loss. We talk about Mikio quite a lot compared to the other Kamis (because he's gone.) I think Yui gets a lot of representation on the sub because we lost her. 

If you go to Youtube there are plenty of comments with people marveling over Su, or gushing over Moa's cuteness. But because Yui isn't in the group anymore I think people are more willing to discuss her. Unlike the other girls, there is a level of sadness associated with Yui now, and talking about it often helps. Hence a lot of Yui talk."

That just comes with the territory. I don't blame someone for mocking me for doing something weird or socially out of ordinary. That's why you try to figure out off hours for establishments ahead of time. But if someone is going to mock or imitate whatever I'm filming, I just try to be glad I've entertained them and hope they don't report me to anyone that works there."

Then they told me that they only deleted my post because they thought it was a spam image post, without checking to see that it was a text report (which is actually encouraged on that sub.) The mod just straight up admitted that he deleted it because he didn't bother looking at my post, and assumed from the title.

Even worse, when I added together all of the karma with the repost karma, it would've been one of the highest ranking posts on that sub. Needless to say, I was furious."

Kid makes an unfunny comment or an unoriginal meme, they get lambasted, and that's that. But now that the internet is more mainstream kids are everywhere. And since their parents aren't joining in too some sites have kids outnumbering the adults. So there aren't enough adults to make them feel bad about it. 

Also, flame culture hasn't aged to well. So the risk of getting flamed doesn't occur to these kids before they post unoriginal shit."

BABYMETAL,fdz2u99,t3_endw2p,1578786096.0,"1. Arcadia - I'ts like Welcome to the Black Parade got mixed with Through the Fire and Flames. Triumphant and powerful. I could see this one becoming the new RoR styled closer.

2. Catch Me If You Can - All the Babymetal parts working as one. Every single member is showing their stuff. Yui and Moa are adorable as hell, and Su sounds like she's having fun. The live version is made amazing by the Kamis.

3. Rondo of Nightmare - Dark and intriguing. Kinda wish a few more songs would explore these kind of themes. The live version is really good (thank you Kamis.)

4. Distortion - A dark song about having fun. The drums hook you in. The synth riff is great. Su shows off two vocal styles and the switch between the two in song is refreshing.

5. Akatsuki - Calming and contemplative sounding. Very hopeful sounding song overall.

6. Onedari Daisakusen - Guilty pleasure song. Hands down one of the best songs in terms of instrumentation. I just wish they reworked the lyrics to be more about shopping and less about swindling ""Papa."" Luckily I don't understand the lyrics so just like listening to the song.

7. Shanti Shanti Shanti - The most creative Babymetal has ever sounded. Not only is it unique to all their other songs, it sucks you into another world. I could see this being used as a boss theme in some kind of adventure video game.

8. Gimme Chocolate - The song that brought me to the party. It gets a lot of love and it earned it. All three girls have something to do, and there are hooks everywhere.

9. From Dusk Til Dawn - Underrated song. Calming and interesting. It acts like a reset button on my mood whenever I hear it. Very sad it didn't get more love from the Babymetal team.

10. Papaya - Instantly induces and adrenaline rush. Makes you want to bust through a brick wall. Instantly restored my faith in Babymetal after their off period."

It looks like it was custom made for the crew. But there is a part at the beginning where a lot of innocents are condemned to Avernus for really unfair reasons. I'm betting that whatever the crew would've had to do to free the Cassalanter kids, it would have lead them to the other group of people who were wrongly condemened. Thus freeing all of these innocents would've been a reason for the crew to go on a grand adventure. While Diath was the one pushing everyone to return to Waterdeep, I could see Evelyn pushing the rest of the group to free this large group of innocents from literal hell."

In that case it wasn't ""logical"" so much as he just didn't care that this might be really disturbing to the local neighborhood, and distract some guards who had better things to do. This neutral character certainly wasn't being logical, he just didn't care about his impact on others around him either way. This was a very popular character among the players."

This is not that. This is a person who has been so terrorized that he's reverted to primal instincts you'd see on a battlefield or when someone is legitimately about to die. Even if the dude is safe, putting someone in that level of distress is not funny. In this case, it's not anybody's fault. No way the girl or the operator could predict a reaction like that.

BABYMETAL,fd7oqer,t1_fcu1ajz,1578207731.0,"Agreed, which is part of why I find it so odd that the Kamis are treated so badly compared to most musicians in other metal bands.

I think the girls are aware that they are a real metal group, even if the roots are pop idol. The kamis seem to know it's a real metal group, while still respecting the pop artifacts that keep them where they are in the group. I'm not sure how Koba views it, and Amuse seems to be in straight up denial about it.

The west especially views this as a metal group first, and an idol group second. Even western publications treat them like a metal band first. It's puzzling that players in Japan aren't noticing/adapting to that."

Sometimes I like to think that Yui is out there practicing some of the new dances, the way she used to practice the Karen Girls dances as a kid.

Stealing Osana's phone can be used in both the explusion, and rejection methods. If I'm not super confident in my ability to pull off one, why couldn't I multi-task and try both at once? And if I did, then would that create any new bugs? Would the conversation between Senpai and Osana change if she tries to show him a picture on her phone, after it was already stolen once? Would you have to steal it multiple times to get both the Monday event for Expulsion and the Wednesday event for Rejection?
