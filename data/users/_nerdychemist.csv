AskReddit,ff2vujh,t3_ercygq,1579526116.0,"My mother in law sticking her nose into my business all the time, for example she wants me to have some of her ugly-ass-cheap-looking curtains. She actually washed and ironed them and now every time my boyfriend and I are visiting his family she prepares them for us to take. We always “forget” them though. She is becoming very passive-aggressive about it. Just last week she told me that we really need to put them up in our “dull kitchen to bright it up a little”....my wonderful 3-colour (white, black, beige) kitchen that I very carefully picked and paid for all by myself!!! Sorry for the rant, I needed it lol"

To the day she died we all called her grandma and she actually was like a third grandma to me. Amazing lady.
