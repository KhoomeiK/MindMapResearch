I was, as a human, pretending to speak as an animal who has, unfortunately, never had the chance to partake in one of your ""tutorials"" or likely even read a book. Honestly, your ""tutorial"" is condescending. Try and relax, these are animal videos on the internet, not an English and syntax lesson. I appreciate your effort to appear more knowledgeable than the rest of us. Cheers!
