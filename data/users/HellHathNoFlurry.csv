I tracked down her brother on FB (who I didn't know), explained what I wanted to do, and sent him a check in his name to ""launder"" the money for me. She posted a really nice thank you on FB to ""whoever sent me this money"" saying it came at a really critical time. She has no idea where it came from. ;)"
