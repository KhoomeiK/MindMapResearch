Poetry,ffhhj4w,t1_ffh8lig,1579935508.0,It can be very hard to unshackle ourselves from the associations of memory.  Hopefully time and distance will help.  It would be such a shame for a poem so beautiful to be ruined for you.
insaneparents,ffhf9ks,t3_ethjom,1579932794.0,"It is so sweet how she has taken your pain and made it all about her.  Like, never mind how you feel, your mom is upset.  How could you? /s (/s /s /s just to be clear!)"
depression,ffhf1t6,t3_etkvgj,1579932544.0,"First of all I think your friend was being a bit of an asshole here.  I don't know what you look like but your friend really went in hard. Is your friend right or not - who can say because beauty is very much in the eye of the beholder.  Secondly, there is a big difference between being good looking and being attractive. Some people are objectively beautiful but sort of ""bland"" and others are not seen as beautiful but are devastatingly attractive. Given a choice, I would rather be attractive because looks fade but that je ne sais quoi does not."
HumansBeingBros,ffhelvt,t3_etl2lz,1579932060.0,Bob Ross was a blessing to humankind. If we could all be a little more like Bob the world would be such a better place.
Mildlynomil,ffhe83v,t1_ffghoua,1579931647.0,Probably not out of nowhere.  There is a super strong possibility that she has been saving that comment up to drop like a bomb at the first opportunity.
horrorlit,ffhcmgw,t3_ethu5i,1579929982.0,Ah crap! More books to add to my list. (Also really looking forward to adding them!)
amiwrong,ffhcjda,t3_etfna7,1579929895.0,"Don't Trash collection companies inform you if they are changing the day? Is it possible your parents were informed and forgot? In any case getting mad and being insulting to someone who has first insulted you is never a good policy. ""Mud thrown is ground lost "" as they say.  Try to stay calm and stick to rationality and facts (easy to say, hard to do). You may not be wrong here but you've not entirely right either."
AskReddit,ff8mp06,t1_ff8jv49,1579686193.0,The friend is weird. It's totally normal to battle with traffic cones. Some people...
depression,ff2n9s5,t3_era8lw,1579514513.0,"The worst pain/suffering you have (physical, psychological or emotional) might not be the worst in the world but it is still the worst you have. The one you have to live with and live through. It is so harmful and invalidating to be told that others have it worse.  If I sprain my wrist and you break your arm should I not be treated just because your injury is worse?"
progresspics,few3tye,t3_eqjyxf,1579404958.0,Really well done.  Congratulations for sticking with it and achieving such great results. You look amazing. It takes a LOT of commitment - I hope you are seriously proud of yourself.

depression,fdq4jvt,t3_emnbdm,1578654520.0,"Your wife betrayed you and your marriage vows. Her response is to blackmail you with the threat of divorce if she can't get what she wants. That is: broken promises, threats, manipulation and extreme selfishness plus a total disregard for your daughters feelings. The best action for you and your daughter (and your mental health) is to make a clean break. There is no room for compromise in the idea of an open marriage - either you want it or you don't. Dragging this out will be worse in the long run. Get your legal ducks in a row with regard to your daughter and leave  because the marriage you thought you had is over. I am so sorry you are going through this."
