memes,ffz7boe,t1_ffz5ify,1580366232.0,He is probably pointing out how retarded basketball is. Its not like he would have done anything constructive for society like code or build something. He developed a god complex from a children's game and ended up raping a woman. And its societies fault for giving someone attention and resources for putting balls into a group of other men's hole. I dont think anyone pays attention to basketball they just gamble on it and snap out of a daydream whenever a whistle is blown.

YangForPresidentHQ,ffyy40k,t1_ffylknv,1580358125.0,I know right I haven't seen them do anything with the millions of dollars. Ive seen one ad and the rest is unpaid work by the poeple.

dankmemes,ffyjtt6,t1_ffyhgt0,1580348134.0,Idiots disagree with me all the time. That's apart of the burden of always being right and sometimes it's a part of proving I am always right.
dankmemes,ffxsrro,t1_ffxp02v,1580331694.0,"If you have an opinion about something you should be able to give reasons and examples why you hold that opinion. Otherwise you are just brainwashed. If he is able to dismantle some ""random college students"" belief system in 5 minutes their belief system is probably flimsy and an end result of propaganda."
dankmemes,ffxqq6w,t1_ffxmyqp,1580330544.0,Its free form and being prepared to debate a subject is how opinions are formed in a free thinking individual. If you have a mob mentality you are probably less prepared and less reasonable. If you are passionate about a subject and cannot form a good argument to support it then that probably means you are just brainwashed. See how I just made a good point. That's all you have to do. You also have time before talking to Crowder to get your thoughts in order its not like he jumps you with a mic you step up when you feel ready. I don't even like the guy so Im just saying. He makes fun of people that look like me all the time so I'm not like a supporter but he has good arguments and bad ones too. Lol this turned into a whole thing. Calm down peeps and creeps.
memes,ffxowjl,t3_evrgg5,1580329515.0,Lol damnit i was so hoping it wouldnt be a bernie meme so i could make the bernie meme....nice one
dankmemes,ffxnclf,t1_ffxjjet,1580328635.0,Looks like you won this debate.
dankmemes,ffxah7p,t3_evp4cv,1580321137.0,Now all Crowder needs to do is start setting these up in front of a sheet of ice and watch them tumble.
