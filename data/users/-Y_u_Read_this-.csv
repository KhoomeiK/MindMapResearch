Yes is hard to learn a language, I get that, however with 10-15 minutes a day you can learn to eorte an essay in no more than 6 monthe. I realize that may seem like a long time, however compare it to real life. People would have spend **Years** achieving knighthood. I should not be a 2-3 week task. It should be a test of determination and mental strength. It shouldn't be something so ewst that it has no value. It should have value, and nothing is more value then achieving something that took a lot of effort to master. I'd addition to that some languages are obviously easier than others, such as those very close to English. Enter Latin. 





Latin is a language which is very systematic and organized. It is close to English, which can help with understanding vocabulary. It is a language wiphich was spoken by the legendary knights templar.




Another language I propose is biblical Hebrew. It has only 8000 words, which makes it relatively easy to learn. In addition it has provided as a basis for some of the most influential texts. And has been important.





These languages are relatively easy, and I speak as a linguist with a masters in linguistics.

3. Make some actual plans. You as the head need to invest more time growing this sub. Right now a lot of people joined, and if they do not see something going g on I can assure many will leave





4. Make a schedule of when each mod will be online.





5. Give us a definite idea of what you are doing. With some rules.

Hello, I have some experience in this field:



1. I am a HUGE history buff and know many things about knights throughout history. I can figure out from what nation and time period the given object or subject is.






2. I have pretty good experience in metal working, casting, and smithing. I know how knight armor and weaponry is made, and can provide valuable information that many do not posess.





3. I have time. I can figure out whether or not the given is a shitpost or good quality. 






4. I have many recourses that are not available to most, I live not to far from the metropolitan museum of art, which has a relatively good knight display. I also have connections at many German museums. 





Please put this into consideration. If I will become moderator I will put in a guild type system. 




People will begin at level 1, and will progress based on quality posts. Quality posts will need to approved. To prevent shotposting I will have a minimum, karma requirement of 1000. I will also try to put other moderators that will share common goals. The hierarchy system will compel good posts. 



System:




Page- Lowest level, lurkers and people with below 5 quality and original posts. Minimum karma is 1000. 





Squire- Middle Level, regulars shouldn't have a hard time getting here. 6-15 original and quality posts. Minimum karma will be 1250.




Knight- High level. Only dedicated members will reach this level. Over 15 original and quality posts. Those who want must apply, only one person per week can become. Over 1500 karma required.







I will also implore a 3 strike system. 1 strike for any of these offenses: 




Reposting




Harrassment 




Nsfw

Breaking sitewide rules
