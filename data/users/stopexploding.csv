As a trainer if adults, sometimes it's easy t I  tell who's speaking up all the time to prove they know stuff to the others in the room, vs trying to prove it to themselves as they learn.  Sometimes it's really hard to tel.the difference."
AnimalsBeingBros,ff7fvqz,t1_ff64y39,1579648605.0,"I was on vacation in Greece a few years ago and went for a run.  A street dog spent about a mile or so with me before turning around and heading back the way we came from.  He was never imposing, just along for the trip.  We saw a lot of dogs hanging out on the street there, and most of them were definitely at least fairly taken care of. 
I'm fact, we saw a guy play fetch with a dog for about 15 minutes near the beach, with a crushed water bottle.  He left and the dog just went about its business."
AnimalsBeingBros,ff7d96g,t1_ff6xsdl,1579646871.0,"When my wife and I were early in our dating, I had a small girl cat named Tank.  Once my then girlfriend starting staying over a little more often, Tank started to get jealous - instead of being friendly with her like she was at first, Tank started being a little standoffish and ignored her.  One night while we were at dinner, Tank decided she had had enough and shit on her side of the bed, right under the pillow.  This had NEVER happened before, and never happened again, hut I'm convinced it was a message."
infp,fewik9f,t1_fevxrcv,1579411260.0,"A Scanner Darkly is one of my favorites, and The Man in the High Castle is also great - and adapted pretty well by Amazon.  VALIS is interesting if you're interested in seeing him work out his paranoia and philosophical thoughts - but it's very bizarre. 
His short stories are great for quick hits of a well thought out universe and exploration of a question."
nonononoyes,ferr8t7,t1_fenxvq3,1579357429.0,"About 15 years ago, I did this for my four year old cousin who was choking on a grape at a family party.  I don't even remember reacting really.  Good Job."
infp,fephyx0,t1_fep7np3,1579320976.0,"I hope it is. 

And if you’re interested in it at all you should definitely read it.  One of my favorites.  

Also watch both BladeRunner movies. But I'd read Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep first.  It's really hard to capture Dick in a movie - even the really good ones."
infp,fejw5ur,t1_fejle5l,1579187237.0,"Interesting. 
I wasn't aware of/had a digital camera until probably 2004 or 5, and it certainly sucked.  
I have been operating under the assumption that this was an actual photograph on film."
infp,fei6mxx,t1_fehxj35,1579131453.0,"What makes you think the camera isn't old, out of curiosity? 
The date definitely says the picture was taken in '98. That being said, it's possible the clock is off."
infp,feh3vac,t1_fegxrtc,1579108597.0,"Yes. It is a date.  
I’m not sure how old you are, but back before we all had supercomputers and cameras in our pockets, some film cameras would include the date on the photograph."
infp,fedyun1,t1_feds94y,1579022781.0,I think it’s 3/5/98.

husky,fdr3k5v,t3_emphdm,1578679018.0,"We've lost two, one husky and one other, over the last six years.  Even with my our two new boys, the pain can feel as fresh as the day of if I let it.  I don't know if that's comforting, but I'm so sorry for your loss. 
The good thing is that the memory is strong, and our two current guys have elements that remind us of both dogs and make us laugh and comfort is every day."
indieheads,fdpd551,t1_fdo8csl,1578625617.0,"The first time I listened to this, close to when it came out, I didn't get it.  I went back to it this fall and can't stop listening to it.  The lyrics are so good - funny, tragic, good stories - and there's something special about the way their voices work together."

LetsTalkMusic,fd30pun,t1_fcyhf4l,1578153653.0,"I used to care about overexposure a lot more than I do now. I'm not really tuned in enough to even recognize over exposure the last few years.  By the time I find out about something it's either ""over"" or the exposure is what got it in front of me to begin with."
LetsTalkMusic,fd30nxd,t1_fcyhf4l,1578153639.0,"The new album i,I has become one of my favorites really quickly.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but for some reason it just felt very comfortable and familiar from first listen.  It feels lush without being over done, and the glitchy and noisy elements seem really balanced by a sense of organic growth rather than construction.  I don't know if that makes any sense at all.  It makes me want to climb inside it and look around.  I'll be curious if it holds up for me over coming years."
LetsTalkMusic,fd2zdr5,t1_fcxqhka,1578153305.0,"Listened all the way through again yesterday while driving around for work.  Forgot how many other high points and subtleties there are.  So many great one liners and jokes - without (usually) seeming ""jokey."""

He's definitely wild. Loves to run with me. 
Not as aloof as a husky can be - I think the ACD in him has made him more snuggly and social."

booksuggestions,fchbnhx,t3_eh64ok,1577649023.0,"Whether you like Dune or not will probably depend on what you look for in science-fiction.  
It's been a while since I've read Dune, but I've read it twice.

It's dense.  I saw somewhere someone referred to it as tedious.  I could see that reaction, but to me it's methodical.  It does operate on a lot of ways as if you know rhe rules of the universe, without a lot of explanation.  If you don't like that kind of thing, the first scene will probably be worth it.  

I may get skewered for this comparison, but it reminds me of the Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) books in that whole there is definitely action packed aspects, it's also hugely about political intrigue. Plans within plans.  

I've enjoyed each time I've read it and plan to read it again at some point.  

I don't know much about the other books - there seems to be really mixed reviews on them."
