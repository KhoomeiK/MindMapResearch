bulletjournal,fdr4okc,t1_fdezr1n,1578679450.0,Glad it helped! It comes from the experience of making these lists and then wishing I had more room to add things when I think of them later.

bulletjournal,fd4y62g,t3_ek1cjq,1578172285.0,"I always leave blank space on my goals pages, because more ideas always come to me later. I'll be going about my day and realize there's this one other thing I've been putting off, so I add it to the list. Some examples of mine are: finally putting up curtains in my office room, doing the paperwork to get my name changed back to my maiden name (post-divorce), and looking for better prices on internet. If there's something you've always wanted to learn how to do, add that. If there's an old friend you want to get back in touch with, add that. The page will fill up faster than you can believe!"
