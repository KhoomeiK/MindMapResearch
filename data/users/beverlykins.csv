pilates,ffo6irw,t3_eud1s1,1580074623.0,Don't compromise the C-shape. Add more padding until it doesn't hurt.
cat,ffjdts5,t3_etursp,1579996177.0,Is Monk his nickname?
TNG,ffjbeu7,t3_etrdzz,1579994764.0,Is the whole season released at once or are they just doing one episode a week? (Why does anyone pay for that sales model anymore???)
seniorkitties,ffh3462,t1_ffgl7t7,1579921811.0,I was going to say that looks like a Burmilla! I have a 6yr old.
Eyebleach,ffgmh20,t1_ffgj9yq,1579909660.0,me too. OP should go back with a sharpie
AnimalsBeingJerks,ffgm9b6,t1_ffgfukv,1579909514.0,"my cats love it. We have it against a wall next to our couch with a cat scratching post next to it. We used to have an old arthritic cat who didn't use it because it was too vertical a climb, but the young ones love it. They like to bounce between the scratching post and the cat tree."

EDIT it's called the Lotus Cat Tree"
oregon,ffg6x6m,t1_fffnaz1,1579899764.0,Right. In NYS you have to literally stand in line the whole time you wait - no getting a ticket and sitting down to wait.
pilates,ffdbnke,t1_ffd0rvc,1579817420.0,awesome thank you! I will definitely donate and take the class! Looking forward to it. What a great idea Shiloh had!

pilates,ff8c4wr,t3_es3bms,1579672528.0,"""100% of the funds collected here, combined with the funds raised in Rael Isacowitz's Mat class on January 25th, will be donated to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)—as requested by Rael's dog, Shiloh."" 

Lol! Well how can I turn Shiloh down? 

Thanks for linking this! I abhor Facebook so I'll do the YouTube class. 👍"

Horticulture,ff7h4jh,t3_ervthf,1579649421.0,"I think this happens in most careers. A lifelong career requires a long attention span. It helps to have hobbies that give us a satisfying gear shift, so we don't get bored from only paying attention to one field forever."
cat,ff7guqi,t1_ff7cvno,1579649241.0,"same with one of my cats. add to the list: tape, silicone kitchen tools, tape, plastic wrapping, tape, Mylar, and did I say tape? He can smell it from a different room. it's really dangerous because it can turn really sharp in a cats' intestines and slice them up from the inside. His nickname is Woo and we have to keep a tight lock down on all Woo Candy."

hummingbirds,fei8zf6,t3_ep8gna,1579132954.0,"hummingbirds brumate at night - they don't feed at night - so as long as your mom goes to sleep well after the sun sets, and wakes up before the sun rises, just bring the feeder in overnight and put it out before the hummers wake up to feed. Set alarm clocks as needed."
hummingbirds,fei8tj1,t1_fei7pgj,1579132847.0,this is the most ingenious method of keeping the nectar liquid that I've heard of. Nice!

TeaPictures,feemerz,t3_eoo7dy,1579036704.0,"wow, nice find! I love the lotus lid handle. is the a dragon on the other side to complement the phoenix on this side?"
tea,feeag4f,t3_eokmi2,1579029725.0,I recommend bringing things in from home and leaving them at work. It's lovely to have a tea station that only I use. I have a zojirushi hot water heater - keeps hot water on tap all day long. I also have a few teacups and teapots along with a colander for catching tea leaves when I rinse my teapots out in the break room sink. When people come into my office for the first time they all remark on how lovely my tea set up is. But no one ever accepts a cup of tea when I offer it. :(

science,febyajv,t1_febto93,1578964221.0,"I find that I have to choose the weed that matches my mood: sunny and happy--sativa; tired and low momentum--indica. If I smoke the opposite of how I feel then I get anxiety. So hybrids always give me anxiety. And then sometimes any THC at all will give me anxiety. CBD in small amounts always helps, as along as I follow my mood with the indica/sativa option. It wasn't till weed was legalized, measured, and labeled that I figured this out."
pilates,feavd0v,t1_feas8py,1578952542.0,Balanced Body has its own training program that is indeed classical. I drove 90min to a neighboring town every 2 weeks for 2 hour lessons for about 8 months for some of my local training. And I traveled to Chicago and Santa Fe for the master training. I did Core Dynamics.
pilates,feaquzz,t3_eoaf3r,1578951410.0,"I started by just being a student of two outstanding classical pilates instructors. They connected me with the people who trained them. As part of the teacher training I had 400hrs of apprentice/student teaching under my local instructors guidance. 

Club Pilates is very different (less thorough) than classical pilates. So you might want to start by finding a classical studio and taking classes in what CP doesn't teach."
AnimalsBeingBros,feaadgl,t1_fe8bojn,1578946252.0,And all the cat shelves. This is a catified house for sure 😻
rickandmorty,fe9zq5v,t1_fe7uo0s,1578942905.0,Exactly what I was thinking--the Buddha already disproved ascetism as one of ego's more self destructive and outright dangerous mind tricks to stay in the center of awareness. And in this case harming the ants. Definitely not a Buddhist meditation session.
rickandmorty,fe6iqw5,t1_fe6ietp,1578892194.0,You waited another half hour? Trespassing on their nest? I'm sure I'll be down voted for this but still...why??? How does that benefit anyone?

seniorkitties,fdtcg10,t3_emwg2f,1578714783.0,"What a magnificent creature. I am SO sorry. I had to put my 13yr old cat down 3 weeks ago. I have 2 other cats but like you, the one I lost was my main guy - my loyal steed as I used to call him. Heart wrenching. The pain we feel now is the price we pay for all the love and loyalty and joy they gave us while they lived. 😿"

highereducation,fdklcnk,t1_fdkhbeo,1578505934.0,"I highly doubt this will come to pass, due to the strength of unionized faculty contracts and the highly educated critical thinkers that bargain better than their administrators."
chan,fdki4gd,t1_fdkcxuc,1578504314.0,"Yes, it was a Japanese style Pure Land temple, now that you mention it. I obviously don't know much about it beyond that one exposure."
chan,fdk5myh,t3_elkv80,1578496616.0,"There's a big difference between Pure Land and Chan. In my experience with one temple that was a few blocks from my house, Pure Land is more like Christian Church and they don't meditate. I didn't feel at home there. Chan is great though. ""Faith In Mind"" by Shen Yun is a book I reread every few years. Teachers are good but don't worry if you don't have any nearby. Read, study, and test everything for yourself. While not Chan, k recommend reading ""The Dhammapada"" and ""the Tao Te Ching"" - those two together helped me orienteer quite a bit. Probably time for me to reread all 3 of those!"
tea,fdiifo3,t3_elhz88,1578443629.0,Agreed. It's a bit lonely to be a tea afficianado in the US. And even the tea shops in town are sub par to what we can all order online. This sub is pretty much my only exposure to other tea peeps. This makes me grateful and sad!

AnimalsBeingBros,fcz8zoe,t1_fcz41z9,1578096088.0,"I used to let my cats outside, until I learned better. They have a very negative impact on local wildlife,.particularly birds, and they get into dangerous, violent fights. I've come to realize the idea of letting cats outside is purely human vanity that they can have a pet that doesn't throw off the natural balance of local ecosystems. The time of humans being reckless with the earth is passing rapidly."
