I ended up eating most of my earnings and taking it to the movies, because I was desperately lonely and there was no one interested in feeding me or talking to me at home.

We weren't really welcome in our own home because it was *her* house and our presence there was a burden on her. We were not allowed to touch anything or do anything other than eat cereal out of the boxes in the pantry. 

This all seemed normal at the time. It was only when I had my own kids did I really how utterly chilling it seems in retrospect."

I would argue that a child (a human!) has a right to have confirmed facts of his or her parentage through his or her life. Self-reporting as far as time and place by the mother/parents is not considered enough in many cases if the child is born out of the hospital, you need additional witnesses (preferably medical pros with licenses to lose). 

All birth certificate reports of parentage should be considered provisional until confirmed by DNA.

First, she wants to believe she's fine and doesn't need any help and she'll get through it. Second, she's a little offended you are trying to outsource her job. Third, she wants you to be so hands-on that you guys don't need help, but you are trying to think bigger picture about to elevate your parenting and your marriage and your life, and she is focused on the details. Fourth, she definitely needs and will appreciate help if it's there, so long as she feels like it's not a subtle attack on her competence. 

So anyway. 

1. If you live in a big city, get all the food delivery and grocery apps on her phone. Make it so delivery is ""free.""
2. Set up subscribe and save for wipes. Diapers, order one off until six months because they go up in size so fast. 
3. Start using babysitting apps and asking for nanny referral from friends. Start using them while she is still pregnant on the pretext ""oh I just want to spend some time with you"" or ""I wanted to give you time to rest.""
4. Housecleaning is also picky. Having a house cleaner can be very shaming. ""The house shouldn't need a cleaner. The house is too disorganized to be cleaned. I feel so uncomfortable giving orders. I don't feel safe having a stranger in the house."" Another one I hear a lot is ""I feel like I have to leave the house when she's here but it's so hard getting the baby and toddler out of the house for four hours."" But she needs and will love a house cleaner if it's there. 

SO:
* have resources on standby
* reassure her that she's doing a great job and you are just trying to use your resources wisely by using your money to reclaim time
* start what you can before the baby comes
* if she doesn't like someone or something, agree with her instinct and help her swap it out."

For example, Sansa kneels a second time, at her wedding to Tyrion, so that he can reach her shoulders to cloak her. She dislikes it at the time but later strongly castigates herself for agreeing to it, as a symbol of Lannister domination to House Stark. 

Kneeling in prayer and kneeling in fealty are clearly correlated in the story as well. Who kneels before the heart trees? Who kneels before the living embodiment of fire, Daenerys Targaryen?"
