depression,fdphvmg,t3_emhzj1,1578629055.0,Yeah man I’ll follow your profile it’d be cool to see what you do.
depression,fdhxqyk,t1_fdgf4x6,1578432077.0,"I feel the same way. The part where everything feels surface level and how it’s hard to follow through. That’s why I guess it’s important to start small. For me, I focus on positive past experiences. Experiences that have shown me there are great people in this world and great moments that make everything else worth it — and I want to be apart of it. Find your positive experience and find solace in it and move forward and eventually you’ll find that reason and you’ll be proud you made it, and you won’t have to look back."
depression,fdgaqhm,t1_fdganl6,1578387531.0,It's almost like we are trying to discredit that vulnerability by downplaying it almost as a projection of our own insecurities -- it's definitely perplexing.
depression,fdganlk,t1_fdg9ygz,1578387417.0,"Thank you. It feels cheap to just reply with that but sincerely this was incredibly insightful and I really appreciate it. It helped quite a bit; I read it three times over. I hope you get some sleep, I will too."

The silver lining is that you can always change. Easy to say, shit, I'm in the same situation. You're not where you want to be and you feel trapped because you want to change but to make that leap to try something different for an endeavor you may or may not even truly want is scary as shit. It sounds like you don't know what will make you happy. You're at a crossroads and it drives you nuts. 

So to start somewhat, you've done the hard part -- you've recognized that where you are is not where you want to be. Needless to say, work from there. Start small. Don't go off in a career change right away. Start with maybe daily exercise for a slight confidence boost. Then try things socially. It's easy to say ""I wAnT tO pUt mYsElF oUt tHeRe MoRe"" so let's also start small. Make small goals like, instead of eating lunch by myself (hypothetically) during work I'll offer to go eat with so-and-so and get to know so-and-so better. OF course this isn't specific in anyway or may not be applicable at all so take it with a grain of salt. Work to get comfortable with yourself in the environment you're already in and then use that momentum and newfound confidence to work towards those big things.

Remember, bottom-line you're not where you want to be. To change that start small and work big. 

I'm in the same situation trying to do the same thing. Change is hard. Change is really fucking hard and I'm doing my best myself. So by human condition, maybe by you trying and me trying, we can help each other. 

Goodnight and good luck my dear friend"
depression,fdg9q83,t3_el8ukn,1578386144.0,We don't like our own weakness. That's what I think. To be vulnerable like that is laughable in a better state of mind.
depression,fdg9mr7,t3_el7fo7,1578386011.0,"This is why I'm afraid to tell anyone about my issues. They may treat you like a basketcase or a freak but you're not. Don;t let that idea consume you, this event that 's happened. You need an opportunity to get away from it.

IT's a scary thought though. My friend hanged himself a year ago a week from today. His mom found him in the garage hanging. No suicide note. No one knew. You're so young, you don;t want to be him. You don;t want to be that person. To be found in the garage by your mom and have an awkward memorial and that's it -- closed book. You end there on a terrible note and that's how you're remembered. It sucks where you are right now, getting help, Treated like this and sectioned, but at least it doesn't end there. You're not dead, and your life has not ended with you in that terrible place as a terrible memory to those around you. You have the power to go above your mental health and to be you. It's not worth it. There's more to life. You don't want to be him.

Just don't let this define you. Don't let this event define you. Don't let them define you. You're more than an attempt and you're more than depression. You write your own story and you have the power to start a new chapter.

Good luck dear friend,"
