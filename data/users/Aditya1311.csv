hyderabad,ffhkh2c,t1_fff9rvr,1579939436.0,"Keep trying, but my advice would be to find at least one flatmate OR you may have to suck it up and pay rent on a 2BHK by yourself - but if you want a flat in the 12-15k range you won't get it anywhere near Banjara/Jubilee main areas. Yousufguda and Srinagar Colony are somewhat closer and much cheaper. You could also look at the area around Khairatabad junction, there's easy access to Banjara Hills from there."
india,fffobt8,t1_fffmo49,1579888259.0,"Ok I don't know wtf you're trying to do here? Your post history seems to be something of a disenchanted koreaboo, it's all just trolling and shit posting on K-pop subs. What exactly is your beef with Koreans?

I work with quite a few Koreans and have spent months at a stretch in Seoul."
AmItheAsshole,fffb9zc,t1_fff2mea,1579880161.0,"FB and IG don't fuck around with copyright infringement either, and they most definitely start monitoring streams when they go live and during the stream, not only after they ended. I have multiple football crazy friends whose phones/computers were completely blocked from all FB/IG access in the middle of streaming a match via Live for the rest of the group to watch."
hyderabad,fff1b3d,t3_et7g1w,1579872954.0,"You will spend months looking for a 1BHK and give up in the end. They just aren't a thing in Hyderabad. Historically real estate here has been significantly cheaper than places like Mumbai and Delhi so there isn't much demand for 1BHKs. This means builders rarely plan and build such flats because nobody will buy them. Most people looking to buy will want at least 2 bedrooms. 

There are a very few I've seen but most are quite shitty. 

Source: been living and renting in Hyderabad since 2010, lived in Banjara until 2016."
india,ffev3qv,t3_esu4h5,1579866839.0,What rubbish. Nobody is being forced to learn Korean. The college probably sees an opportunity to increase placements by giving their students a competitive edge. No need to have this pseudo nationalist ego outburst.
todayilearned,ffeqg39,t1_ffe6anl,1579860380.0,"There is a series of books called the Axis of Time written by John Birmingham. The premise is that a near-future multinational task force is testing advanced technology; somehow they end up creating a time warp and all of them are transported back in time to WW2. 

It's quite interesting as there are Japanese and German vessels included in the group and of course back then these nations were opposed to the Allies. One of the British ships also has a black female captain which causes a fair deal of controversy in the past, not to mention the general concept of women serving in combat roles."

TopMindsOfReddit,ff9kafs,t1_ff9hwqo,1579714799.0,He apparently wrote a program to play Tic Tac Toe on a computer that only had a teletype printer as an output device. When he was 14.
windowsphone,ff68bbz,t1_ff65d9o,1579621506.0,"Insta was like that for everyone back then, it's only in the last couple years that FB has been monetizing it properly. I was managing an advertiser portfolio worth around $1B annually back then and most of my clients barely spent anything on IG. Not because we didn't want to but the features simply weren't there. Now literally everybody wants to get in on those inventory ads and whatnot. It's a completely different ad platform these days. 

That said you're much more likely to get targeted for ads based on your demographic, known interests, etc. There are some niche formats like app download ads but even those are cross platform."

india,ff2tjhz,t1_feyq3d4,1579523556.0,"Famous players participate because of money, money comes from sponsors. The whole thing only works because there are hundreds of millions of people in India itself who will watch, plus the worldwide audience who watch because of the big players. This allows sponsors to make back their money. 

Without that huge base of viewership the whole thing falls down."
india,ff2r79v,t3_er93a6,1579520447.0,Customs scan your bags these days and put you through a metal detector after landing. Last time I landed there were people whose luggage didn't come through on the belt and instead they were asked to go to the customs desk.

IAmA,fexr0ee,t1_fevjrzj,1579434967.0,I used to work at Google and there was a meme on the internal network that went something like 'not sure if g-bike being stolen by hobo or ridden by Distinguished Engineer'.
windowsphone,fewr5h6,t1_fevkngo,1579418260.0,"> The developer of the WP Snapchat app offered the code to Snap for free, and they turned it down. They simply refused to allow the platform, period.

Did said developer (Rudy Huyn I presume?) also commit to paying for the maintenance of the code and accept liability for any vulnerabilities or other defects in his code? Every time I see this stupid argument it makes me laugh, people have no idea what modern software development is like at a corporate level."
india,feud2zd,t1_fesliaf,1579385385.0,Wow such anecdote much evidence. This is like those people saying well I haven't seen discrimination so casteism doesn't exist!
india,fetzmlt,t1_fetfta6,1579381626.0,"The Holy Trinity is in my opinion one of the core beliefs necessary to be considered Christian. Without any of one of God, Jesus or the holy ghost the core myths break down."

india,ferj5qc,t3_eqfxm4,1579354564.0,Two years ago I got a new number and shared it with a limited number of people. Apart from friends and family I only had this number shared with Citibank for otps. Six months ago I added the number to my SBI credit card and that same week I started receiving all sorts of spam texts and calls.
india,fer8tet,t1_feqvb04,1579351261.0,"No, denominations of Christianity all believe slightly different things. They all believe in the basics, Jesus is the son of God, the Holy Trinity etc. But Roman Catholics for example believe the Pope is the earthly representative of God and whatever he says is the final word. Protestants in general don't believe this. Baptists forbid the drinking of alcohol while pretty much every other denomination has no problem with drinking."
india,fer89qb,t1_fer2wwl,1579351033.0,"The word caste does come from Portuguese and it's related to the Latin 'castus' which means chaste or pure. The original Portuguese word was used to refer to clans and other blood lineages or races or breeds

When the Portuguese came to India in the 15th century they encountered the Indian caste system for the first time and they started using the word caste to refer to it. So while the word comes from Europe it originally meant something completely different and it took on the modern meaning specifically to refer to the Indian varna/jati system."

horizon,fengz88,t1_fenghib,1579284477.0,"I don't want any of those things. I want a system that lets me play games with minimum fuss. I don't want to worry about cooling and drivers and any of that nonsense. 

Sure when I was in college with plenty of spare time it was great, now when I have work and other things taking up time I don't have time for it."
horizon,fengbtw,t1_fen8ydu,1579284077.0,"Exactly. I can't sit at a desk after I get home. But I've tried the PC + TV combo and tbh it still doesn't work for me. The UI of the system overall is just not designed for controller. You need a mouse and keyboard for too many things. If I could leave it in Steam Big Picture or something similarly I might be persuaded. But to be honest I could get used to that. The maintenance of the system itself is the real deal breaker for me though. 

I mean, I was a sysadmin once upon a time and I am fully capable and competent to manage a Windows installation, but keeping Windows itself and drivers updated and all the other fluff that goes with it, it's simply not worth it any more to me. I barely get an hour a day and maybe more on weekends to play and I want to spend exactly zero minutes screwing around with Windows."
horizon,fen4c3e,t1_fen2cis,1579276679.0,"I would never want a PC again for gaming simply because I don't want to deal with Windows and sitting at a desk to play. With my PS and Xbox I can bring them out of standby and be playing in seconds, never have to worry about fucking Windows Update."

MawInstallation,fen20n1,t1_fekwdoh,1579275206.0,"If I recall correctly the Republic's medical facilities tried to treat him but he was officially pronounced brain dead by the GAR's medics and was going to be taken off life support. The same thing happens to people all the time today and most likely any Republic citizen could have the same thing happen to them. I don't think this would qualify as euthanisation.

Fi only recovered because Bardan Jusik refused to give up and healed him with the Force after many hours of work. It wasn't like the GAR's medical system decided he wasn't worth the expense of medical care, he was braindead and they had no way to heal him. I doubt Force healing by Jedi was available to most clones."
