Epilepsy,ff9mb10,t1_ff9l58m,1579715983.0,"I can’t have caffeine, as it exacerbates my myoclonics, but I’ve been doing NSAIDs. I imagine it would be even worse without them."
legal,ff9lxy0,t1_fdiagqp,1579715771.0,"So, as a follow up- he served a week in jail for the misdemeanor in September so even though he was out on bail, that was his time served. The plea deal the SA ran by me a few months ago before they knew of the latest arrest stayed the same. He got 30 days and 3 years supervised probation. Only punishment he got was an expedited plea hearing...  When I called the other county, they said they have no way of knowing someone is out on bail. That’s wild to me but nothing surprises me anymore."
introvert,ff9ljo5,t1_ff7lp3p,1579715538.0,"Ok, well then forget all I said. There are legit people who will post things a ton of times. Must have been a bug since Reddit doesn’t usually let you post more than once in ten minutes."
introvert,ff735sd,t3_erxd0b,1579640189.0,You're not being forced by your friend to go. Don't go.
introvert,ff7327b,t3_eryfdt,1579640132.0,"I will tell you, if your energy in bombarding this sub with the same question multiple times is an indication of your friendship style, I would just urge you to chill a little with your introvert friends. Not to speak for all introverts, but for me any hint of more-than-normal pressure to engage sends me in the opposite direction."
depression,ff71fee,t3_erqjbv,1579639215.0,"Yeah, this is not great. I've been clinically depressed for most of my life, but as someone who has also had lifelong epilepsy, I can tell you sitting injured in hospital rooms doesn't make you more visible."
depression,ferpad1,t3_eqcju4,1579356800.0,"That’s why there are mental health professionals. If we spiral out being unfairly frustrated with people who don’t have depression not understanding it, it just makes things worse. Someone who has never had the flu Or isn’t a doctor isn’t going to be able to conceptualize the flu. Someone who hasn’t gone to war or specialize in PTSD isn’t going to get it. It’s not their responsibility any more than it is for you to understand their mindsets, which you state here you don’t. 

I went through this period of time in my lifelong depression and it’s a road to nowhere. Find someone who understands for a living and can help you get to a mental place where  it doesn’t matter to you whether or not people understand your feelings. They’re your friends. They like you. 

Sorry for the tough love, but I’m 20 years into depression and it’s an energy suck trying to control other people’s perception outside of a clinical setting."
Epilepsy,fero5vw,t3_eqeez9,1579356388.0,"Mileage may vary. Even on a day to day basis for individuals based on sleep quality, stress, time of day. There really is no answer to this question, unfortunately. Sure would be nice if there was."
WTF,fernpfm,t3_eq7bo6,1579356207.0,Whoever took this video is an even bigger cunt.

legal,fdzppva,t1_fdysmyu,1578792996.0,"That makes sense. I'm in Florida and there was a huge death row case recently, so I think a lot of the SA's were tied up with that."
legal,fdzpmq0,t1_fdyt2o2,1578792952.0,"Yeah, I actually want to be as far removed from it as possible. He's a creep. I'm not even going to any dates and didn't file for restitution for my broken window."
legal,fdzpgbf,t1_fdysr0w,1578792860.0,Holy crap. I am so sorry. This system is insane!
aww,fdxvd7y,t3_en8enw,1578773314.0,Are these frenchies??
legal,fdhfvc0,t1_fdfgpd5,1578421771.0,Thank you for the info. I hope so too :/ I hate the idea that he is that out of control and free.
depression,fdesp1r,t1_fc5vur0,1578345798.0,"Oh right, grams!"
depression,fb4k4z8,t1_fb3v6x0,1576510464.0,I wish. I can't find a doctor who will do it with my Epilepsy because jury is still out on safety.
