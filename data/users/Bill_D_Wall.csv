AskReddit,fenu1u8,t1_fenich7,1579290704.0,"Either way, it's a mind-bender. Logically, there are two possibilities:

a) something was created from nothing, or
b) something has always existed

Neither one makes any sense to us, because human minds cannot fathom an infinite chain of causality, nor something just being created with no cause."
AskReddit,fensv4l,t1_fenbjyq,1579290236.0,"To be honest, this philosophical problem exists regardless of what you believe. If you believe God created the universe, you are left with the problem of what created God. If you don't believe God created the universe, you are left with the original problem - what did?

Humans just can't get their head around something existing from nothing, or an infinite chain of causality. But that neither suggests nor opposes the existence of a God."
todayilearned,fejwdcc,t1_fejvspc,1579187371.0,"It's clear you don't understand what forgiveness is.

Nobody should deny those things happened, or pretend that they weren't terrible. But there is nothing British people today need to do to ""make up"" for them. That's the point of forgiveness. Seems like you need to get your head around what that actually means, otherwise you're going to be filled with resentment."
todayilearned,fejupl6,t1_fejtxi1,1579186282.0,"Well I agree there. Brexit is the worst decision the UK has made in many years. And I think in a few years we will be coming back with our tail between our legs, begging to be let back in.

The whole NI peace agreement thing is exactly why forgiveness is so important. Only by wiping the slate clean on both sides (loyalist and republican) and forgiving the other side for past actions will the peace agreement be made a lasting one."
todayilearned,fejtlrw,t1_fejsj18,1579185543.0,"I'm British and agree with pretty much everything you say. Churchill is adored here because he beat the Germans, conveniently forgetting the travesties he contributed to or caused.

But this is not an excuse for Irish people (or anyone else) to hate upon British people today. My ancestors might have screwed over your ancestors, that doesn't mean I would do the same, or that I agree with what they did.

'Forgetting' is to deny the past happened, which is never right, but forgiveness is necessary otherwise nobody can move on and make things better. Most European people have forgiven Germany for what the Nazis did. It's time Irish people did the same* tbh...

*Edit: to Britain, I mean."

You're still protected by Section 75 if anything goes wrong after you terminate your CC contract, surely?"
AskReddit,fcvhfug,t1_fcucg76,1578002161.0,"Kinda. ""Average"" doesn't _necessarily_ imply that the sample set is split evenly. For example, if the population is 4 people, three of whom die at 10 years old and one person who lives to be 1000 years old, then clearly more than 50% of the population died below the average life span which would be 257.5.

However, 'average life expectancy' as it is commonly calculated doesn't use the statistical mean, and would be expected to fit more in the middle of the sample set."

Or, just get rid of the process altogether and then you won't have this problem :)

I take your point that prisoners can possibly escape and commit further crimes. I just don't think one can definitively state, without knowing ahead of time, which criminals are beyond rehabilitation and which aren't. There are plenty of reformed murderers and pedophiles, and statistics that show that property and public order offenses have a higher recidivism rate.

I suspect the issue is partly ingrained in culture. Studies have been conducted showing that the reason for higher recidivism in the US compared with many European countries is due to the focus on punishment and keeping criminals away from the public, rather than education and rehabilitation into society. Humans have a need for mutual respect, and they are more likely to commit crimes if they believe they don't have the respect of others. Many European justice systems have realised this and sought to struck a more even balance between punishment and rehabilitation into society."
todayilearned,fc8sbve,t1_fc8pyul,1577541096.0,"I never said all pro-DP people were out for revenge. All I said was that if you take into account the fact that capital punishment is more expensive (which it sounds like you agree with), then there is no quantifiable/objective reason to seek the death penalty. The only *remaining* reason would be to see vengeance done.  The convicted person is in prison for life without parole anyway, so you are not protecting any members of the public by killing them.

If you're advocating removing the legal checks and balances surrounding the execution of an inmate and just popping a cap in their head as soon as the trial is over, then I suggest you go live in some backwater country with a dodgy legal system and see how you like it when friends or relatives are summarily executed for some political bullshit reason. Developed societies have evolved through that crappy situation, decades or hundreds of years ago, and quite frankly we've realised the absolute stupidity of it and moved on."
todayilearned,fc815tc,t1_fc7apq3,1577524117.0,">I do not like seeing people like the criminal in this story get a lifetime of free room and board and hot meals on my dime

Nobody *likes* the thought of paying for housing criminals, but most people realise that it's a necessary cost of maintaining a functioning society. The death penalty costs more due to the legal processes involved, so you as a taxpayer are actually getting a better deal (financially) than if the death penalty existed."
todayilearned,fc7zwkh,t1_fc6szus,1577523120.0,"Proportionally very few, yes. But still far too many in my opinion. Executing any number of innocent people is absolutely not a price worth paying.

The legal checks and balances for death row inmates cost more than lifetime imprisonment in most cases (in the US, at least). If this is taken into account then pretty much all quantifiable reasons for the death penalty disappear. All that remains is the public's desire for vengeance."
todayilearned,fc7xwft,t1_fc6hx7c,1577521557.0,">The alternative to the death penalty is basically life in prison, which is not really a better option for those innocent people.

Of course it is a better option. Life imprisonment at least gives the hope (however faint) that the conviction will be overturned and the falsely convicted person will get their freedom back. Do you seriously think most innocently convicted people would rather be dead?"

programming,fb1zjer,t1_fb07nip,1576443392.0,"So much this. It's insane the number of times I've tried to convince people to use a library and had to argue against their mentality of ""but I didn't write it myself and don't understand it, so I can't use it because it might have bugs!""

If you use pre-written libraries there might well be bugs and vulnerabilities too, but they are much more likely to be found and patched than if you write the code yourself (if it's a well-maintained or open source library). The only minor benefit you get if you write everything yourself is security through obscurity, which isn't really security at all."
