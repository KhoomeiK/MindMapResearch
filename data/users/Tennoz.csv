Always rip this shit off because it causes exactly what you see, water and salt gets trapped inside the plastic and rusts.  The best way to prevent this from happening is using undercoat spray paint on any bare metal you see as well as any metal that is likely to come in contact with debris which would scratch it.  As far as repairs these panels probably will need to be replaced, the damage is likely far more than what appears.

\-Rim bent near connection (bead) to tire

\-Rim bent in a way that prevents it from being 100% circular...

\-Any foreign object piercing/pierced the sidewall or relatively close to it

\-Less than 4/16ths tread depth (legal limit is 2/16ths but 4 is arguably at the end of safety life) this excludes track tires obviously....

\-Any cord showing, if you followed the tread depth advice above this should be obvious but clearly its not.  In case you aren't aware cord is a sturdy cloth that the tire is built around so to speak.  If you see this on a motor vehicle tire its bad, aircraft tires have tread wear limits listed on the sidewall of the tire.

\-When in doubt read the &\^@# sidewall of the tire, it tells you everything you need to know such as cut limit, wear limit and PSI limits.  PSI limits is debated between what is listed on your car vs what is listed on your tire, regardless of what is listed on the car NEVER exceed tire PSI limits.
