AskReddit,ffa9ua7,t3_esc8vq,1579730701.0,I would ask whatever question 30 year old me asked me when I first used the time machine at 13.
DestinyTheGame,ff986as,t3_es8p57,1579707079.0,"I don't think Bungie is necessarily trying to craft ""you had to be there"" moments. They had a goal in mind here, one that made perfect sense, but they've messed up the implication.

Bungie realized that there was a massive content bloat, and that players were running dozens of activities, all of which were still content-relative, making things difficult for them to balance and plan around. They had mentioned this in their TWAB, and it was even discussed here when they had that wonderfully written, multi-thread message explaining their goals and ambitions for the future of the game. They were constantly having to look at an activity from two years prior, figuring out how their new items would interact with that older, mechanically outdated, activity. To circumvent this, and make things easier for them *and* us, they opted to go for this seasonal activity system; a system that allows events to come and go fluidly, limiting the content bloat and making sure certain events are only around for X time before fading away. 

I understand their logic, and *many* other games make old content either fully vanish or become utterly irrelevant.

The problem here is that it just *doesn't work*. Knowing an event is going to disappear doesn't make me want to play it more, it makes me not want to play *at all*. Seeing a deadline in front of me, a literal ""You must compete this event within three days or it is gone forever"" comes across as anxiety inducing, predatory behavior. Certain events, like the Sundial, would be *great* if they hung around. They don't need to be updated for modern content, and they can keep dropping lower LL gear despite future increases, but utterly removing them just makes them not feel worth playing.

It also *has* to cause some internal design issues at Bungie. The number of times they must say, ""Oh who cares if that part doesn't work perfectly, it only has to last three months.""..."
DestinyTheGame,ff9533q,t1_ff8qm9c,1579705040.0,"If you aren't min/maxxing they work perfectly fine.

I wouldn't want to use one against a boss, as they are a bit slow compared to other weapons, but they melt through adds and elites handily.

Le Monarch is solid, and I have one of the newer bows (I really can't recall the name) with Dragonfly and Explosive Head, so that thing just burns through packs. An Arsenic Bite with Archer's Tempo is also pretty solid.

Again: not a boss-weapon, but definitely works for PvP and PvE, generally speaking"

He was 6 years old and very shy, so when he told me he wanted to go in the tube thing *attached the to ceiling*, I was all for it. I got him inside, watched him go, and took a seat.

Somewhere between five and ten minutes later I decided to get up and see if I could find out where he was. Moments later, I saw his little face presses up against the plexiglass bubble, crying hysterically. I guided him out (by vaguely pointing at where to go) until he escaped.

Turns out he hated it and wanted to leave seconds after he got in, but was wholly and utterly lost inside the twisting maze. I'm sure there are some psychological scars we should look into there"

DestinyTheGame,ff7451y,t3_ervmfl,1579640745.0,"Because, honestly, there are more incentives to not get it to be heroic.

If you're farming events for a mission, it's generally faster to just nuke the boss down and sprint to the next event. Even if you *do* get two points for completing it heroic, it's often not worth the time standing in the circle.

Then there are those Calus bounties that want you to do X public events without dying. By just nuking the boss down you can get a clear done quickly and safely, making that mission easier

The reward for doing it heroic just aren't worth the time and effort."

You can always adapt the original 5e rules for crits: when you crit, one damage die is always MAX, and you roll the second as normal.

They created a huge puzzle, a massive map, and got an entire community involved on this. Entire webpages were developed and thousands of people dumped as much information as they could on this. It was a true, genuine community event, and I really enjoyed watching it unfold.

We ended this event with nineteen new lore pieces, a new emblem, and the path to get a new exotic gun. We also got new dialogue from Saint, and learned that we die in a timeline.

It was a community driven exotic hunt. We had fun doing it. The mystery was a blast to solve.

Did you expect Saint-14 to reach an iron gauntlet out of the screen and give you a handjob? 

>There was this massive cloud of mystery around what exactly was going on here, and tons of theories floating around about the end result. 

That's your fault for falling into community speculation, not theirs. 

>Bungie seemed to imply the end result was this huge mystery akin to the Whisper or Outbreak quests and missions, where we get this amazing exotic at the end that we didnt know was coming back. Nope.

No, they did not. You assumed that, and you allowed the community insanity to sweep you in. Bungie has said nothing other than, ""You're all doing great,"" and, ""Hey, take it slow. It's a marathon, not a sprint.""

>All of this is for something everyone is already massively aware of. Its like going to see a movie that's supposed to have a huge twist and then realizing the twist was given away in the trailers, and you just didnt want to believe that they'd give it away like that.

It's ""massively know"" because data miners fucked it up for you. Bungie created a story, a puzzle, and a fun mission. They did that and had the rewards set up. Some data miners found the item at the end and ruined the surprise for you and everyone else. That is not Bungie's fault, that is the data miner's fault. Bungo is not obligated to rewrite an entire quest because some dipshits love ruining surprises.

> This is nitpicky but Saint-14 describes the ""mystery weapon"" as our favorite gun. OUR FAVORITE GUN. If this gun is mediocre or bad, Bungie just put into CANON that Bastion was our Guardians FAVORITE GUN. How presumptuous is that??? And we all know that if this gun kicks ass, it's just gonna be nerfed in a couple months and no ones gonna use it again

Oh, piss off. Saint is being Saint. We've all been told something is out ""favorite"" before, and Saint is probably being hyperbolic.

First, if this is just a big array, designing it isn't THAT hard. They just generate blank tiles and fill them in, then track that the player fails the path when one is entered. 

Second, it makes it *easier* to generate a massive map. A bunch of blank slots means they can dump those in their map to fill huge amounts of space, then design a complex path around it all.

DestinyTheGame,feptoe5,t1_fepd8h2,1579330909.0,"> -How did we think to do this?

Obelisks across the system began displaying seven symbols that rotated every hour right when the new dungeon/zone came out. By looking at the symbols on the Obelisks and following those pathways in the Corridor of Time, you would enter a room called The Timeless Vault, or something similar, and get a lore card.

If you looked down from that Vault, you'd see a reflection containing a big hexagon, a symbol in the center, and a blue border. Each hexagon was missing one side of the border. There were 19 codes revealed by the Obelisks. By looking at the hexagon in each of those nineteen Vaults, a pattern was found. This pattern was turned into a map. Following this map lead to room 20, plus an emblem. 

In room 20 there is also a giant hexagon, but the symbol and openings on the border change for each person. What you are seeing in this map is the collection of thousands of people submitting their hexagon info. A map is being made.

If a single Fallen, carrying a single gun, could happily and easily slay a Guardian than there really wouldn't be much of a war, eh? A single Guardian has been proven, through gameplay and lore, to be able to handily dispatch a small battalion of Fallen. 

You're giving them too much credit, looking too deeply into my hastily typed story, and are wholly missing the point of this entire thread."

raidsecrets,fendbhp,t1_fen9m2u,1579282242.0,"After finishing the Emblem code you can look down and see a huge hexagon with emblems around it. The central hexagon is huge, has a big icon on it, and has a blue border. On this blue border, some edges have a gap (no border). This hexagon is different for each person who enters, but there have been repeats.

My matching the symbols and the opening and closing of these borders, the hexagons can be matched up to create some sort of maze. 

The maze hypothesis was confirmed by discovering the Emblem code. 

When you input the initial codes to find the lore pieces, there is also a hexagon with broken edges. By logging these hexagons a map was discovered. Following the path on this map lead to the Emblem."

I mean, when you get married sex is *mostly* permanent. Gaming, though? God, it's so depressingly fleeting.

Humble-brag story time, folks:

I was *really* fucking good at Halo 2 and Halo 3. At 14, my group of four was touring our city and playing in local Halo tournaments, readily winning (or comin top-3) consistently. When I would play with just one of my buddies, our Team Slayer strategy was this: at the start of the game, we would crouch down, toss grenades at our feet, and suicide. This would cause the team to lose one point, and the score could go negative. Once we hit ~-30 points, our allies would quit and it would be just us. We'd keep this up until we hit -50 points. Then we would start to actually play, and, far more often than not, would win the round. The only way we would feel challenged is by giving ourselves a severe handicap.

The same basic deal happened in Halo 3: we would win virtually every match by 30 or more points (I easily had 200 steak dinner medals) and would quickly get bored. We eventually just quit because the ranking system sucked - we'd win ten matches in a row without leveling up, then lose one and drop two or three levels. It just wasn't worth it.

My point is this: sex is temporary, but can lead to long-term love and a happy life. Those great things you do while gaming, though? No one gives a fuck. I mean, how much do you, the reader, give one flying fuck about my story up there? I'd wager not one bit."

I didn't like Amnesty, at all, and I can't get into Travis's new campaign at all. It's too, uh, bubbly? 

I've been *deep* into NADDPOD, though. The fact that the PCs are constantly almost about to die makes it exciting, Murph is a rock solid DM, the story is engaging, and they're also stupid-funny."

5x level 6 characters readily took down a young white dragon and a frost giant. We got some decent loot, a load of gold, and were feeling pretty unstoppable. 

We get back to a keep in the North to report back, when the now-dead white dragon's dad came back. A good ol' ancient white dragon. 

Thing blew the keep to pieces, slew thirty or so guards, knocked out to of us with a breath attack, then dipped out for plot reasons.

If you're standing guard, holding your stupid rifle, and you see a chick riding a motorcycle towards you, jump off, magically jump two more times in the air, turn her body into pure electricity, slam a truck sized hole into your base, and start hurling fucking lightning... your ass is running away.

Hell, let's even assume you decide to fight, like an idiot. *You* get lucky and *you* pop a round in her head. She dies, head clean in half. Your buddy goes to check on her. There's a light flash of light. She's standing now, head intact, holding the severed upper half of your bud.

Bungie LOVES complex puzzles (ilovebees was a cross-American GPS hunt for phonebooths), but this is just ridiculous; I can't imagine Bungie would expect the community to slam out tens of thousands of maps, generate scripts and programs to map the corridors out, and recruit thousands of people to donate data.

Next week we're going to get another piece to the puzzle that blows the whole thing open and makes it considerably easier than it is, I'm calling it. This week we found the corridors, uncovered the Emblem, and are generating data for next week. I really don't think this MASSIVE map being made is going to help all too much.

Then again, they did just recently locate the edge of the map... Which means ground *is* being made."
