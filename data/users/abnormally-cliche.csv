Astros,ffikb4n,t1_ffi3mm6,1579975911.0,Yea thats true. But I don’t think it helps that they were implicated the year before making future accusation more likely to be investigated again. Regardless anyone claiming Manfred is protecting the Astros is just delusional.

Oh know downvoted for expressing my opinions on a shitty movie. The movie was boring and drawn out and De Niro and Pacino were way too old for their roles."

Astros,ffhjpxx,t1_ffhdbhw,1579938390.0,And yet Manfred is only covering up for the Astros buzzers lol crazy logic. No ones suspicious why New Yorker-Manfred never investigated the Yankees both times? *puts on tin-foil hat* Kind of makes sense why its only the Astros and Red Sox getting caught.

Also you keep bitching that its a grey wolf when there are many other species in China to begin with that would look far similar to these *unknowns* than a freaking grey wolf?

If there is a coup Im sure it would make more sense for it to be the people controlling almost every branch of government and breaking laws and skirting checks and balances at every corner. How has impeachment been a sham? The first article in which the OAG deemed it to be illegal or the second article of obstruction which objectively happened and Clinton was also accused of on top of the perjury article.

It doesn’t require much critical thinking to see that if someone says “hold on” then ducks to grab something that they are going to stand right back up. Seriously common sense is so far gone that it has killed accountability. At this rate nothing is ever anyones fault. The gymnastics of “she was in front of her so its her fault” like EXACTLY! She was still in front of her from handing the weapon and telling her to wait lol hence why she would assume they wouldn’t aim and fire the weapon especially so quickly.
