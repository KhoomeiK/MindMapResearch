I can't think of a scenerio that fits your situation that would legally require your landlord to take action against a third party for you. you can ask the management company to work with you, and they might say yes just to be kind, but legally they don't have to. and it may be likely that the management won't take you to court, they may just sell your debt to a collection agency which will affect your credit and the collection agency may take you to court."

legaladvice,ff3j38t,t1_ff3helh,1579542123.0,">my right as a tenant to quiet enjoyment of my apartment

this is an actual legal term that basically means that the landlord can't harrass you or excessively come into your unit without proper notice where needed. quiet enjoyment actually has nothing to do with noisy neighbors. like I said, you can call the police and file a noise complaint whenever they're too loud, but none of your legal rights have been violated"

these are the faults of other tenants and not your property manager, so these faults aren't grounds to break the lease

>other issues which included being without heat from mid-November to mid-December

did this issue ever get resolved? what was the reason you were without heat? in many states landlords have a duty to provide habitable and safe conditions, which includes heat. and when heat isn't provided then there are certain steps you can sometimes take (like withholding partial rent, fixing the problem yourself and deducting from rent, getting code enforcement involved, etc). but if this issue is already resolved then there's not much more you can do besides complain to management. 

I would call the police and file a noise complaint Everytime they got too loud. but besides that these aren't grounds to break your lease without penalty unless your landlord agrees to let you do that. so you can complain to them about all these issues and ask they let you out the lease but they have no obligation to do so"
