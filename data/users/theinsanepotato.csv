All the insane shit they pull off with cgi and editing and special effects, and you really think it's necessary for an actor to literally inhale powder up their nose just to make it look like they're doing coke?

I mean, if there's a scene where an actor is supposed to be shooting up heroin, do they actually stick a real needle into their arm and really inject fluid into their veins? Of course not. They use special effects to make it LOOK like their doing that."
todayilearned,fgv6g65,t3_f0k18w,1581138545.0,"...why in the fuck are they ACTUALLY snorting anything at all for a movie??? Just PRETEND to snort whatever it is. Yknow...  act? and the use special effects make the coke pile get smaller.

Like seriously what the actual shitting fuck.

Theres a ton of ways they could do it too. Easiest would probably be to have little tube hidden inside the straw (or rolled up dollar) that leads to a little vacuum pump. Have the tube run down the actors sleeve, and have the visible part facing away from the camera so their hand is in front of it and you never see it. Boom, done. Im some random guy whos never made a movie, and I thought that up in 2 seconds. Why in the shit eating fuck cant hollywood, with hundreds of billions of dollars and tens of thousands of people making movie, come up with something like that?"
