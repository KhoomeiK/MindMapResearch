You have to understand that the Holy Trinity, God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit are three parts of one entity. So by sending Jesus, God sent Himself.

For six years I had this dog... and each and every year his aggression to the other dogs in the house hold was building. Along with it, stress and tension. 

Last year I felt I was losing my mind. This dog could no be out free with the other dogs. If I was not in the room supervising, he had to be crated for fear he woild react if someone came to the door or it another of the dogs barked at something - or God forbid, they decided to play.   Those last two years with him were very hard. 

I didn't realize how badly it was affecting the other dogs in the house until he was gone. The chaos in my house has disappeared. 

Surrounding him was the right choice. For him. For me. For the other dogs in the house. It wasn't an easy one and I dearly miss him. 

I'm sorry you have to go through this. Sorry that people have been jerks to you about it. You need compassion and understanding, not people who have no idea what you're going through judging you about it. 

You're not a failure. You're not a bad person."

He will figure things out very quickly by the sounds of it, and especially if he has lived with other kids before. Dogs are incredible smart and can be very adaptable."

Leave the toys in areas where the baby will be, and just keep working on it. The command you use are not important so long as you stay consistent. Work on his ""Leave it"" and make sure he's not snapping toys out of your hands."
