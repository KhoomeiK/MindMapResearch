AmItheAsshole,ffo15n5,t1_ffo013m,1580073065.0,Ok. NTA. I understand your hesitance in letting her continue to use it. It would be nice if you did. It’s just for another month. She also would need to continue to carry full coverage.  You  did say she was your best friend.
AmItheAsshole,ffnzwk1,t3_eucv60,1580072780.0,Info:  why is it all of a sudden a problem with her using your car?  Did you just break up?

Save another little soul by getting one from a shelter or take in a stray. You have a tremendous amount of love to give and someone needs you as much as you need them. My prayers for you. May you find peace soon.  If you need to talk, feel free to dm me."
