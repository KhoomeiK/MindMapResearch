dogs,ffg6ngk,t1_fffrpfh,1579899597.0,"I already posted about my awful encounter from the other day, but tldr is that this man was doing the same thing, only he had NO control! 

I used to take my dog on off leash runs when he was at peak performance because I could 100% trust him. 

Right now we've both got a bit of flab and aren't in the right mindspace to be doing that...so we don't."
dogs,ffg6f0r,t1_fffqp4d,1579899452.0,"God, that's so crazy. For many reasons, of course, but my worst thought isn't that my dog wouldn't come back, it's that something would happen to him on his way home!"
dogs,ffg67xh,t1_fffpsdq,1579899330.0,"Just the other morning I encountered an off leash dog while taking my dog for a walk (on leash)

I live in the part of a small town surrounded by large towns (not a crazy amount of stores, mostly homes, with stores less than 10 minutes away) we have one major road that runs through the town that a lot of houses are clustered around. I live on this main road and was headed back towards home when there was a man standing outside waiting for his dog to go to the bathroom. Okay fine. Maybe the dog is on a retractable leash. 

Nope. This dog is right next to the main road, off-leash, AND as I am trying to pass I very loudly told this man my dog is not friendly (leash aggressive) and he mumbled something and is calling the dog to come, which, as you might imagine, did not listen. So at this point his dog is off leash, on the sidewalks next to a main road where morning rush hour is starting, and not responding to him. 

My dog and I picked up our pace (and he actually did really well with this dog trying to stick it's nose up his ass!!) And as I passed him I said ""and next to a main road, real smart""

Wow, clearly I have some pent up emotions about that...but people are just fucking stupid. That's the bottom line. And there aren't many intelligence tests done on people who get dogs."

Dogtraining,ff42zxd,t1_ff2pov8,1579554425.0,"When I moved to my apartment with my dog he would not poop here. I take him with me to a horse farm every day and he would wait until we went to go poop, because he knew the place. I've loved here for 2 years and he is has just started consistently pooping. 

Good thing we plan to move after this year lol"
Dogtraining,ff3z2y7,t1_ff2svfu,1579551993.0,"I was wracking my brains for answers as I looked through the thread and now see he's a Chow mix. 

I have a Chow mix and can pretty much tell you he's guarding. That's his room his bed his person. And it's night time and things go bump in the night so he's not taking any chances. 

I think he should stop sleeping in the room at night to help curb the behavior. If you are a very confident dog handler you can body block and practice with your dog to tell him A) you are in charge B) these things that he thinks are his are not. 

My pup came with me to a friend's house the other day. My friend has 2 dogs and my dog has known both dogs since they were puppies. My dog LOVES the couch. That's the holy ground. Well, he was on the couch, laying with my friend and her dog comes over to say hi. My dog let's out a low growl. Nothing mean, but I am a very experienced dog handler and knew my dog was saying ""hey man. *I'm* on the fucking couch"". So. I told my dog to get off the couch and he was not allowed on the rest of the night. 

Possessive and guarding behaviors from a large dog that is mixed with a breed that is known for being aggressive and guarding are not easy to manage. It takes a lot of time, a lot of patience, and even still my dog growled at that other dog. 

Whatever you decide to do, you have to be serious about the decision, which also means you have to be ready to train 100%. You don't decide not to body block one time because you just got comfy in bed. 

My final piece of advice, see a dog trainer. I said you need to be an experienced handler to handle this and if you are not that, it's okay, but don't pretend to be. Dog's speak almost entirely in minute body language and if you don't speak the language you won't make progress."

Dogtraining,ff3xhr6,t3_erfxk0,1579551000.0,"This is all good advice I am seeing, BUT, dogs can and sometimes will try to ""pet you back"" and the only thing is, they suck at it. Pup likes face pets? Maybe my human does too! 

What I think you need to do is let your dog know it HURTS when she doesn't those things. Yelp! Whine and cry and then still get up and leave. Dogs absolutely understand being hurt but that doesn't mean she knows she's doing it. 

You definitely seem to understand she's not being bad or mean, she's just being a dog! So talk to her in a way that she might understand it more"
raisedbyborderlines,ff3wjzk,t3_erbwgk,1579550407.0,"Going through this with my mom right now. On top of BPD she's made some pretty poor choices recently that have left her much worse off and feeling like she belongs no where (but this is because she screamed and said awful things about her family and left for weeks...but now it's over a year later that she hasn't been home and she can't go back) and I feel so horrible for her, I really do. But what can I do? I try to help and she shuts me down. She only reaches out or talks to me when she's already miserable and just wants to bring someone else down to her level and because I don't want to be there, I look like the asshole that isn't there for her."

TwoXChromosomes,feh4h12,t3_ep35qj,1579108953.0,"Not a secret, unfortunately. I live close to Lancaster, PA where there is a huge Amish community. 

I've gone out that way and seen whole families that look exactly alike. And while that's been known to happen, the most horrifying thing I saw that will forever cement the incest was a whole family that had a very prominent bald streak down the center of their head. Mom and girls still had long hair in ponytails but...what would be a center part was easily 2in wide. And dad and the boys had the same thing. 

A) Both parents having this mutation? Must be related. B) what has to happen first to get to that mutation... Not regular baldness as even the youngest child had it.

She sent some self-depreciating texts over the next few days and then sent a text pretending Christmas never happened. 

Before, during, and now after the holidays I told her that behavior is unacceptable and she is traumatizing her children, 2 of which are still high school aged and can't just get away from it. I told her calmly and with examples of how she's hurt us and she responded that no matter what we went through, the emotions and feelings she had were worse.

Tip: dogs rely on their noses more than taste when enjoying food (learning this made me feel better about feeding goodies that were barely tasted) so making things that smell great are very important!
