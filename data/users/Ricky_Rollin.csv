BreakUps,ffp8vxm,t1_ffnjhas,1580089105.0,This... what sucks is I used to have dreams while we were together that we were broken up and I will wake up from my nightmare and heave a sigh of relief that it was all a dream. Now I have dreams that we are together and I wake up and have to remember that we’re not. My heart is destroyed. I can get over this but I don’t know if I’m ever going to find anybody else. I think this kind of sealed the deal that I’m going to be a misanthrope hermit type.

I’m sorry but that’s just fucking retarded.
teenagers,ffertbi,t1_ffeic5m,1579862412.0,I agree. Somehow in her throws of depression and crying she takes her phone out and grabs a selfie and then proceeds to upload it to Imgur and then post it to reddit?? Ok.

gaming,felbaqw,t1_fel8x8t,1579218157.0,The main answer to your question is that they showed trailers that most certainly were not procedural and made the game look like it had so much more flora and fauna. The planets looked like they were just teeming with life and the life that was there looked absolutely amazing. What we got was nothing even close to what the trailer looked like.

Out of nowhere there is an omnipresent being who is so old the affairs of man didn't even affect him physically (nothing happening when he put the ring on). He felt like a god who simply staycations in those woods. Don't get me wrong, I love love love Tom Bombadil, one of my favorite chapters, but putting him in the movie just doesn't feel right. I think it's because mainly when you watch a movie every scene has to be important to what the story is trying to say and adding him in there did nothing for the story and would leave heads scratching as to why Tom's bitch ass couldn't deliver the ring himself."

grandpajoehate,fe0ciwx,t3_endg38,1578809793.0,"""So I walk in the house, my big ol stiffy hanging out, slapping my thighs as I walk into the home of Grandpa Joe. I pick up my mast and let it drop on the bed grandpa joe and his wife are laying in. They both stare at my cock, bulging and full of splinters from chopping trees earlier. I stare at Gpa Joe, we make eye contact but his keeps breaking to take a peek of the monstrosity that lays before him. By now it was not only throbbing, but it was hissing like a snake, quivering left and right, up and down...searching for some ovaries to scramble. 

I finally break the erotic silence,

""Now what are we going to do about this""? I exchange looks between Gpa Joe and his wife. His wife hasn't stopped staring at my big ol dick, her eyes locked in, her mouth salivating, her nipples getting hard. She has only one thought and one thought only...""how much of that can I fit in me? All 3 of my holes...""

Gpa Joe tries to get up, protesting my lack of clothes, summoning what little courage he had to say this though deep down he KNEW he done fucked up. 

I stare at Gpa Joe, fire burning in my eyes that raged worse than my hemorrhoids. I pick my cock up and hold it over Gpa joes head and say ""shut up beeitch"", and lay Thors hammer on his face knocking him out. 

""Now that that faggot is out of the way mam, how about you get on your knees and slob on this fat dick""? 

She complies...the head is barely in her wanting mouth when Gpa Joe wakes up and sees the biggest dick getting crammed down his wifes throat. 

""I...deserve this"", he says, wiping tears from my his eyes using an old smelly cum rag. He sobs to himself a little more as he listens to his wife suffocating on the anaconda...

""I DESERVE THIS""!!!!!!!"
