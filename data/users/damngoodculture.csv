This is known as the ""Barry Sanders Rule"" because this is exactly how the situation played out in his case, as he was required to pay back a portion of his bonus. The difference between now and then is there was no precedent when Sanders played; now, it's explicitly written into the CBA to allow for this arbitration.

There is some relief if retires and the Redskins want to pursue that route. Which I certainly would.
