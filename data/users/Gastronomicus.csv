I wouldn't say that. In many places, pine is grown much like a crop - monoculture genetic clones doused with fertiliser and the soil treated with herbicides and pesticides. There is a lot of concern runoff of these chemicals into waterways - there is often less oversight than for agricultural lands - and pine plantations are not considered well-balanced ecosystems. Furthermore, high frequency clear-cutting of pine leads to soil degradation and erosion. Pine can also be harvested in partial-harvesting systems that reduce some or most of these concerns though.

Hardwoods on the other hand are often managed using partial harvesting methods (selection system harvesting, shelterwood) that reduces impacts on soils and promotes a more mixed and balanced ecosystem. But certainly not always - clearcutting of hardwoods is not unknown and some land owners are just looking to make a quick buck rather than manage for long-term biomass yields.

In the end it comes down to how the stewards of region manage their forest. I speak to this as a someone with a professional background in forest soils, ecology, and forestry. Unless we have specific information about where it comes from, I think it's just fair to leave the environmental aspect out of the decision."

DIY,ff3rz4w,t1_ff3o09z,1579547570.0,"Hardwood comes from broadleaf trees - could be deciduous (maple, oak, beech, ash, and pecan) or evergreen sub/tropical (teak, acacia,  are the most commonly used for flooring. Teak, walnut, and cherry are particularly nice but quite expensive. The density/hardness varies, but maple is considered the gold standard for hard and durable wood.

Softwood is generally conifer - think spruce, pine, cedar, or fir. While some softwood can be relatively hard, they're generally much softer than deciduous trees. There are broadleaf trees with very soft wood too, like poplar, but these are usually not used for flooring when used in home furnishing.

The main differences will be in wear and grain patterns. Hardwoods will definitely resist wear much better. Try and press your fingernail into a piece of maple. You can't. Try with pine - it's easy. Softwood tends to have large and distinct grains that are less nuanced then deciduous hardwoods like maple and oak. Personally I quite like the look of pine but it will scuff much more easily as flooring. These days polyurethane coats are well-engineered to better protect softwood, and due to a glut of softwood on the market these days it can make an affordable flooring choice. Hardwoods are much more expensive, and often come as a thin veneer over pressed-wood, which means once it wears out it might not be able to survive a refinishing.

Should studios adjust movie/shows brightness for people with poorly setup TVs too? To be honest, they do to an extent, same as for games. At a certain point you need to balance pragmatic usage and artist direction. I've found very few games that were unplayable at recommended brightness settings provided that the monitor contrast was set up properly. 

If you haven't, I'd strongly suggest using a [website like this](http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/black.php) to help adjust your contrast and brightness settings. Start with adjusting your monitor itself, then consider changing windows display calibration settings to tweak it a little further. It's definitely helped me reduce necessary brightness to see things in games."

It gender labels implicitly by saying ""my dude"" and ""brother"" to the kid. Why not just leave gender out of it entirely if the kid seems to be questioning it? Just say something like ""Boys can like pink and skirts too. You might be a boy, or maybe a girl, either is fine with us. Wear whatever colour and style you like."""

Both are in the *southern* part of the African continent. Neither are a part of South Africa, the country.

The problem is the term ""South Africa"" being being used a region, when it is both grammatically incorrect and misleading. If referring to being part of the southern continent, either ""the south of Africa"" or ""southern Africa"" are appropriate."

They adjust the lighting according using high quality monitors that have a good contrast ratio. With a good-quality well-calibrated monitor you won't have any issues with the recommended brightness/gamma settings. The problem is many people are using lower end monitors, usually cheaper TN panels that have poor contrast ratios. Chances are if you're having problems with the recommended settings either your monitor settings are off or your panel just isn't up to snuff. In which case you probably will have to adjust the brightness/contrast accordingly."

When you're suffering severe hypothermia and in survival mode, you are barely conscious, so the hindbrain is likely making most of the decisions without your conscious input. If you were to try and speak to someone in that state they would be incomprehensible and unaware of their situation. Unfortunately, once someone has reached that state the chances of survival are low even if advanced medical care was available."

It's been super cold in much of Canada recently, and [Environment Canada is predicting a low of -35 tonight for Edmonton with highs of -33 warming to -4 by the end of the week and lows increasing from -33 to -7 by the end of the week](https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/ab-50_metric_e.html). In Yellowknife, [tonight it will drop to -40 and warm to -23 by the end of the week ](https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/nt-24_metric_e.html). Bastard cold, but a lot better than -35 to -41 all week, and definitely not the ""coldest place on earth"". In the city of Oymyakon, Siberia, [temperatures are ranging from -36 C to -44 all week - including the daytime highs](https://www.accuweather.com/en/ru/oymyakon/571464/daily-weather-forecast/571464), notably colder."
todayilearned,fedr1zs,t1_fecgi1v,1579018048.0,"It makes sense though. The capillary network in your skin functions like a radiator. When you're losing a lot of heat, the body reduces capillary blood flow to the extremities in order to reduce heat loss and keep vital organs functioning. If you've ever had very cold hands/limbs for an extended duration then quickly heated them up under warm water, it causes a painful burning sensation as the capillaries begin to flood with blood.

When people reach near terminal hypothermia, the body last ditch response is to push the blood back out of the core to the extremities, possibly as a way to encourage a more aggressive search for relief. Instead, you experience extreme pain as the capillaries become flush with blood and your highly-sensitised nerve endings become overloaded. Now, imagine being in a state of terrible confusion due to hypothermia and near-death when this happens - your primitive brain responds to the pain, possibly thinking you're on fire/overheating, and the mere feel of clothing on your skin is agony. In response, you shed anything you're wearing, and quickly perish."
todayilearned,feco96v,t1_fecn3le,1578978948.0,Yes I agree 100%. There is no reason to cut old growth at this point except to further line the pockets of a handful of already rich people. It would not comprise a significant source of income for the forestry sector in BC.
todayilearned,fecjonj,t1_fec4dbr,1578975555.0,">  all... 4 billion? of those trees were cut down and replanted?

No. Most of the trees have naturally regenerated. But vast portions of the park have indeed been harvested. Definitely not the whole park though."
todayilearned,fecjk6m,t1_fecalsl,1578975465.0,">Lots of forest companies in Canada clearcut and pretty much nuke the forest 

BC has it's share of mismanagement, historical and ongoing. 500+ year old forests razed to the ground without due consideration to the ecosystems and communities of people (largely first nations) within and around them.

However, you can't compare all forestry in Canada the same way. There are a lot of different forest types and they are managed differently. For example, boreal spruce and aspen is clearcut, for two reasons: 1) because it wouldn't generally be economically feasible otherwise, 2) the forest will not regenerate properly. These types of forest are even-aged when mature and do not live long before being burned and regrown (fire cycles range, 25-200 years, shorter in the south and west and longer in the north and east). Trying to harvest them in a less intensive manner just leads to die-back and poor quality wood in mature trees mixed with poorly growing regeneration that can't thrive under the low-light conditions. So in the case of boreal, clearcutting makes more sense both economically and ecologically. It's not without issues, but when done with a solid management plan that protects riparian and other sensitive areas it is much less problematic than it appears at a glance."
