1.  Biters on the warpath seek the nearest chunk with higher pollution.   
2.  When the biters can't find any chunks with higher pollution, they attack all player structures in the area.   
3.  If they see a military target (e.g. a turret or radar), they immediately shift their targeting to destroy that and then attack everything else in the area.   
4.  If something blocks their path, they will attempt to go around.  However, if the blockage would cause them to deviate too far, they will attack whatever's in their way.  This seems to act like a timer on how long they spend correcting their path, which can be a problem for ""dragon's teeth"" defenses meant to stall or channel them.   
5.  If they run out of targets, they go back to step #1.

So unless they've gone into ""attack all nearby targets"" mode from step #2 or been blocked by large solar installations in step #4, you should be fine.

If you keep them small or well spaced out, you might be just fine.  In theory.  As long as you don't have an irregular pattern of pollution spread / sinking that causes a cloud to stall out in the middle of your solar field or something else that breaks up their seeking.  I've never tried this."

However, you are right that there are cases where someone attacked with fists has been allowed to escalate to lethal force because they *believed* they were threatened with death.  

One famous such case that shows up in a lot of law textbooks is *Washington v. Wanrow* (Wash. Ct. App. 1975).  Originally, Wanrow was convicted of the second-degree murder of a drunk child molester that was attacking her, because the court ruled under jury instructions that asked whether a reasonable *man* would fear for death.  The court of appeals held that her small size and gender meant that was not a reasonable standard to apply to whether it was reasonable for her to feel threatened in that situation.

No matter how big a person is, use of fists is generally considered non-lethal force, even though you can accidentally kill someone with a bad KO and a subsequent fall.  Use of a weapon often is considered lethal force.

In an assault or battery case, the right of self-defense can be invoked by whoever defends against an escalation of a situation.  The first escalation is the use of non-lethal force.  The second is the use of lethal force.

If you grab a beer bottle and smash it over someone's head, because they attacked you, you have escalated the conflict from non-lethal to lethal, and technically *they* had the right of self-defense past that point.  You would not be able to assert self-defense in that situation.

However, nothing makes you choose to expose yourself to a variety when you can instead pull a comfortable blanket of confirmation about you.

Whereas in the past, racists were being isolated by a society that increasingly pushed them to the margins, on the internet they can find whole communities of like-minded individuals to tell them that their darkest thoughts are normal and right and to push them further and further into radicalization.  If it's not racists, it's conspiracy theorists, or people with eating disorders, or anti-vaxxers.

The internet is the new Dark Age.  I call this the Blinding Age, where there's so much information that none of it has any weight or truth anymore.  Welcome to the age of Fake News and curated social media feeds."

factorio,fgh1wip,t1_fgguoqf,1580774731.0,"Personally, I wouldn't worry too much.  You have to cut two flamethrowers to sever the lines completely for the section between them as you note, and each turret or section of pipe holds 100 units of fuel, which will last 33 seconds on their own.  That should be enough time for robots to replace at least one of the destroyed turrets, and it's far better for enemies to run through an additional three squares of flame.

OTOH, it might be smart to break turrets in to segments with a pipe between them and add a second line of pipes behind them.  That will provide an extra level of connectivity and in the worst case an additional 100 units of fuel per pipe segment.  A couple of extra reserve tanks in the middle of the formation (connected through underground pipes) would provide extra redundancy.

That would, however, slightly reduce damage throughput and put the gun turrets one square further back.  It would however reduce flamethrower coverage by a lot less than retreating to the second line of turrets as u/polarpupper suggests.

The thin stone wall in the south is a much bigger concern IMHO."
