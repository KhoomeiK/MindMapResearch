It was awful and embarrassing, but the strange thing is that then I was no longer worried about being perfect. I figured I never had to be *that* bad again.

If you're playing for free or inexpensive gigs, nobody will expect you to be perfect. Don't worry about being perfect, just try to be good enough for the current audience.

Making mistakes is part of the human experience. I saw Iron & Wine live a few years ago. While he was playing, a string popped. He didn't have a tech to switch out his gear. He had to switch strings in front of thousands of people, and the audience cheered him on while he had a embarrassing moment. After that, he played a beautiful set.

The audience doesn't expect you to be perfect.  
The audience is there to have a good time, and is on your side."
