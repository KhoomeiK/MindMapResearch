Jensen and Sneaky were benched because Repeared was not happy with their attitude and dedication, seeing how they got smashed repeatedly in scrims by their own Academy (GG smacking Jensen and Sneaky+Smoothie getting smacked bot vs Keith+Zeyzal) due to not taking it seriously and not focusing. On top of that, they had serious issues with transitioning into mid game due to comm/shotcalling issues, which was why Zeyzal was brought in after excelling in that role for Academy.

Any consumate professional SHOULD dislike being benched. That dislike does not, however, make it unjustified. If Jensen left necause he thought C9 wasnt where he'd win trophies - that's fair. If he left because he got benched, then shit, he needs to grow up."

Certainly there are similar correlations between the neurology of a person and ASPD traits, no?

As far as I'm aware, people can conclusively be born far into the ASPD scale without any trauma or environemtal trauma.

What I was arguing, is that the person feeling like his peers are stupid doesn't do so in a way that harbors ill intent or as a way of looking down at them. It's meant as a matter of fact. Feel free to replace 'stupid' with any other word, semantics were not my point - I was referring to how frustrating it can be to feel like you can't find stimulating conversation because people you talk to can't keep up with your train of thought or level of understanding - and what they deem stimulating conversation is boring and seems completely pointless to you. 

It's not a matter of better or worse. It's a difference. I personally harbor no ill will towards people who aren't able to discuss astro physics, politics, economics, painting or whatever else you'd consider requiring a certain level of skill, expertise and/or intelligence to excel at. Most people find plenty stimuli in discussing how tired they are from work, how that meal they made the other day was really good or whatever they feel like - small talk, mostly. There is nothing wrong with it at all. 

Just like there's nothing wrong with feeling no sense of reward and point to it either. 

> Not enjoying small talk doesn't make you smarter.

This is obviously true. There is no causation here, but there is a high level of correlation. Being of above average intelligence has a significant correlation with favoring rational thought over emotional thought, logic over feelings (has pros and cons, for the latter see other posts referencing mental health for this demographic). 

> It is what you use to learn about the other person, their interests and knowledge, hobbies and goals, which enable true conversations of depth

That's not unequivocal. It remains mostly true to someone who require a level of comfort, trust and/understanding of the person they're talking to enable a higher level of conversation. However, for someone who only care about the subject or topic at hand, and concern themselves with the facts and rationale, these things don't really matter that much. You don't inherently need to understand, like or connect with a person to accept a good argument on it's own merits. 

I want to stress I'm not defending being an ass and saying ""I can't help it, I'm too smart"" - an ass is an ass. 
Just trying to add context to how the ""other side"" functions - the biochemical reward system is so central to our every day behavior, and it needs to be mentioned."
GetMotivated,fcvni9m,t1_fcvbq81,1578005916.0,"Thing is, though, that when you can count the amount of actually stimulating conversations you have per year on two hands - despite concious efforts -, that's what you're left with. When people simply arent able to follow and/or comprehend what you try to talk about, when when you dumb it down, that's realistically the only explanation. It's not about 'dumb stuff' or topic based, necessarily. It's the depth anf level of conversation. How rational, reflected and challenging it is, whatever the subject.

Not being smart enough to participate at a certain level of conversation does not make one a lesser person. Parallell to that, someone feeling like everyone else is stupid is not wrong either. Our desire to discuss and converse is driven by the stimuli we're rewarded from it. The colliquially named small talk is as widely indulged in as it is partly because of culture and partly because it yields a certain amount of stimuli for most people.
However, most people of above average intellect don't experience that stimuli, and such it genuinely only seems as a social construct without amy purpose than can be skipped without anything being lost.

This is one of the situations in life were neither party are of ill intent. The person saying everyone is too stupid means no harm by it - it's just the most apt way to describe why they struggle to find meaningful social connections."

I can't speak to any specifics on why Navi has issues with DX9. My gripe is the fact that it's _only_ Navi. Previous gens of AMD GPUs drivers support it fine. All NVIDIA drivers too. When AMD can make drivers for Vega and Polaris that support DX9 fully, making sure Navi drivers do the same shouldn't be that hard. Their code for interpreting/reading the DX9 .API exists already, and porting it to a new architecture shouldn't be _that_ hard. Especially considering DX9 games aren't obsolote in any capacity yet. 

I do get yor point, though, it just seems like an oversight more than anything from AMDs side to me. That being said, it's still _playable_, just annoying.
