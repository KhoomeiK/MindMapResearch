how do you propose these situations occur then. morality is a learned thing, not something inherent in people. do you feel the game is what is teaching those morally reprehensible ideas? i certainly don't, just because the tools to cause suffering exist does not mean people will pick up those tools. so since the game isn't teaching that, just providing the tools, all i have left is to believe the negative morality being shown was learned previously by the person committing the reprehensible act.

just because a person doesn't act on psychotic tendencies, does not mean they don't have them."

am i wrong? do players not troll others in open? is it some sort of bastion of good will and honesty and i am just missing out?

my moral value was made outside of video games, i just apply them to video games, like everything else in life. i don't just turn off my values because i can't physically see the person on the other side, do you? 

dungeons and dragons was (at the beginning) a purely pve experience. technically it still is, DND 5th ed explicitly states that the players in the party are inherently organized to work together as a team to overcome challenges.

my viewpoint is based off of my own personal values. where making someone elses day worse for no reason in particular is just something someone shouldn't do. 

you can try and say it's just ""blowing up pixels ships"" but if that's your argument you are either oblivious to, or willfully ignorant to the fact those pixel ships are being flown by another person. you are bottom line ruining their enjoyment when you blow them up (if they weren't looking for a fight. looking for a fight is a different story)

this would have helped immensly"
echoes,fdsdxxc,t1_fdsbex7,1578700467.0,"i was wrong about the numbers, but it just furthers my point. if a venture naturally flies at 475m/s which i don't believe without some serious skills, it will take even less damage from those rapid light launchers. how much i am not sure because the formula for calculating all this is ridiculous. but i would venture a guess into the 50% or less (than original potential) range. now that is still 800 rough dps. so it very well could be a quick fight, but we haven't really talked about what the venture could be running. if it had a ab on and running that damage gets reduced even more. potentially to the point you could call the venture a speed tank. then it becomes a game of capacitors and neuts/nos'. it would be an interesting thing to watch. but it still paints a potential picture that is inherently flawed, and why the designers intentionally designed the game to have a single damage type available to a ship. i was honestly surprised to hear you could fit turrets to the venture. i never attempted it myself because the venture is a miner and i used the ship for it's purpose. 

in the end though you are getting hostile, so here is where i part ways with you. good day."
echoes,fds2m5c,t1_fdruz6s,1578693393.0,"well the kicker to that fit is the explosive velocity. a non AB'ing venture flys at around 200ish m/s, which would mean those missiles will do substantially less damage. 

in terms of a fight, with the venture dps fit vs that cyclone, so long as the venture stayed moving it could win the long haul. however the power of the cyclone in this situation is those neutes. unless the venture fit a nos it would not be able to keep energy long enough for the guns to keep output. 

but it wouldn't be a walk in the park for the cyclone. which is my beef with the idea of fitting guns and drones. it should not be possible for a venture to kill a bc, a gang of them sure. but not solo. does this specific example say a venture could? not technically, but it does come pretty close. and that pretty close leads to things like suicide fits, which in my opinion are a blight on eve."
echoes,fdrt0zr,t1_fdrd6g5,1578689306.0,"i can't get into the game anymore to get the numbers, but 2 light drones did 230ish dps and 3 light rapids would do around 325ish dps. for a total of 585ish dps for me.

a cyclone can do 1600 dps against a non moving cruiser size target in optimal. against a frigate like the venture moving on zenith at it's optimal, i HIGHLY doubt it could pull those same numbers. and if it was truly pulling 1600 dps we know it wasn't tank fit. so in a head to head fight, with the venture at optimal, i would gather the venture has more than a little chance of winning with combined firepower."
echoes,fdqs6l3,t1_fdqbhrx,1578673736.0,"drones do have some flaws, mainly with their ability to hit even slowly moving targets. their damage numbers fly across the whole range with no real stability. sometimes they all wreck, sometimes they all miss. this even occurs on stationary targets. 

i think having drones and guns together on a ship would be massively overpowered with echos current balancing. that venture fit is the equivalent of a battlecruiser level of firepower. given how battlecruisers aren't even available to a player till tier 8, it would give a massive dps spike super early.

drone ships are meant to focus on drones, not have a mix. echos is meant to be a simplified version of eve for mobile. putting in a mix of weapons on a ship can cause confusion and frustration."

in your venture or hold that has a ore bay, instead of tapping loot, be within range and open up your inventory. you will see the can as a selectable option and from there it works like moving things around in a station. tap the icon on the far right of your ship bar near the arrow point right, that will let you choose ore or drone hold. this is how you can loot drones directly to your drone hold to be usable."
echoes,fcqqrpk,t1_fcpfklv,1577890719.0,does the pod just have more stability naturally? or is there some timing issue which requires that setup.

echoes,fcp1zyz,t1_fcowqyv,1577848026.0,i think i understand what you are saying. but i am guessing that using my apple user account that has my ee beta account would probably be a bad idea on a pirated apple os running on a vm box.

echoes,fcoi3ur,t1_fco8y4s,1577832769.0,"here are the stats for a pilot optimally skilled to fly a Gamur, and for the price you can pretty much expect optimum skills.

Role bonus: -50% flight time, +200% missile velocity

frigate command per level: +25% light missile damage (125% total)

advanced frigate command per level: +1 scram/disrupt strength, +10% opt range (+5 scram/disrupt strength, +50% opt range)


it is impossible to get away from an Gamur if they scram you. it's bonuses are way to powerful. the closest you can get is in a venture 3 with a role bonus of +2 warp stab, and fitting all lows with stabilizers. that would give you +5 warp stability, which only matches a max skill bonus Gamur. you could spend a buttload of isk for stability rigs as well. but at most that is 6 more strength for a whole lot of isk. that would save you if you were against a single Gamur with just 1 warp scrambler."

DestinyTheGame,fclduwo,t3_ehflwx,1577745517.0,"the big failure i think is you believe all those world ending events your guardian stopped, that he/she/it stopped them alone. which is NOT the case. every player is ""the guardian"" but in the world, when you take on the raid, you are going in with other guardians, and the story of the raids do not account for a single guardian doing these feats. 

we are strong, but not strong enough to solo crota/oryx/every raid boss ever. (and no, your titan/hunter/warlock solo 4 hour kill does not count, because exploiting mechanics is not the story and you know it)"

starcitizen,fcksq11,t1_fcksi53,1577732367.0,"that's why i was weirded out when i saw this. same thing for my combat ships. my f7c will always have full fuel and weapons when i pull her, if i switch to another ship after doing my thing, then come back to her she is full again. i thought that was what happened when you docked at a main location."
starcitizen,fckpxb1,t1_fcko9ok,1577730647.0,"maybe it was session change then? i have had multiple times where i would hop in for an hour, go mine something in my mole, land and sell and quit game. It would always be in storage when i logged back in and i have NEVER had to fuel it."

maybe i just don't play enough to have seen this?"

sto,fcgesh3,t3_egwtiz,1577639256.0,"all i have noticed when i am rubberbanding is it's always performing an action of some type while in an instance with a population greater than 15 (an action zone) or 30 (a passive zone like ESD). it doesn't really matter the action, be it moving firing or ability use. but it is always a path resetting one, never an action resetting one. i will still end up doing sed action, it will just occur a number of steps back from where i was previously when i do it. i will be ""slid"" back into that previous place while doing the action.

*edit* every time i see this i go to change instance to go to the lowest population one, and my rubberbanding is normally 100% resolved. and if i am in a low pop and then it starts happening, every time i go looking back at my instance number and notice it is now above those thresholds."
