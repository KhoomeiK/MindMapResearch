It appears to be a hard wired device.  What's interesting for me here is the fact that law enforcement use these trackers on people who for example are released from prison early who they believe are involved in crime.  We work with law enforcement in both north and south america and these cases fascinate me.  Hard wired devices are most commonly used for fleets or personal use in personal vehicles.  It could be that this woman just by fluke dreamed up this phone number and it was connected to this device.  Crazy story.

The person I know spent about 16k I'm criminal attorney fees, to have the charges dropped.  The Crown Attorney admitted her statements sounded blatantly false and made no sense.  His attorney specialized in domestic violence situations where long term couples were divorcing or separating and he was told that false allegations occur frequently when someone wants full custody of children and/or to stay in the marital home.  It's a horrific situation that really makes it that much more difficult for women who have really been victims of violence.

There were also many murals that had been painted on the sides of buildings downtown, which were also beautiful.  Main Street didn't look much different to me.  I walked from Portage and Maryland to Portage and Main and headed up Main on my own.  It was Sunday, and I saw a lot of the alcohol related problems I remembered from the 80s.  In the 80s there was also a lot of ""huffing"", which is a solvent soaked rag being held over the nose.
