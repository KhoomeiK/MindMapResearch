ebikes,ffvn6mg,t3_evgikg,1580268086.0,What's the brand of trunk box? How do you like it? I really want a hard box like that on my bike but there doesn't seem to be *anything* in the sweet spot. I bought one that's 8 liters and it's too small. That one looks about the size of the 17 liter trunks I've been looking at and I'm afraid they're too big. Around 12 liters would be perfect but I've all but given up looking.

ebikes,ffs9v60,t3_euyiar,1580176673.0,If you're able to keep storing it inside I recommend charging your battery while it's still mounted to the bike as often as possible. It's not a *real* issue but locking mechanisms are something that will inevitably experience wear just from regular user and when they do people eventually get things like power loss over big bumps from a loose connection or batteries falling right off the bike. Its nothing specific to Rad Bikes or anything it's just a good practice to have if your environment allows.

I was coming from ten years of no cycling, but I've had to buy new jeans twice now because I've outgrown them. I was very briefly self conscious about how thicc I was getting but I've embraced it. I do feel a difference between the workout I get at 25-30mph and when it's off at 15-20mph, even at the same level of exertion. I don't know nearly enough about physical fitness to try to guess how they affect you differently but I do try to mix it up when I'm out for the purpose of exercise because it feels like a more complete workout."

ebikes,fffup3i,t3_etbz42,1579892195.0,"Technically the Juiced equivalent would be the plain RipCurrent which gives it an $800 difference in price. It's the better bike for sure but less embarrassing that they're not at the same price point. That said if I were shopping around for a fat tire ebike today I can't imagine I would want the fenders and a rack of the RCS instead of a belt drive (unless the battery turns out to be tiny in comparison), even though it too is a couple hundred dollars cheaper and I'm a bike commuter. I also don't care for integrated batteries. In the end though.. belt drive..

*Edit; $2750 is the pre-sale price, guys. So not quite the knock out of the park that OP was imagining. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.. Killer bike regardless but I'm nervous what the regular retail price will look like now. It's also 48v but performance can speak for itself, they also don't mention a class or top speed however.. just that ""it's fast!"".*"
OldSchoolCool,fffr88x,t1_fff4d42,1579890048.0,It could've been a more expensive camera that could take pictures in bursts. Kids with those expensive bikes could've had access to a camera like that too.

ebikes,ffayyz2,t3_esh22u,1579747746.0,"1. Juiced Bikes Crosscurrent S. It was well worth the price to me due to the amount of utility and fun it provides. Easily some of the best value per dollar I've spent.

2. Juiced has some of the best performance per dollar. They use custom designed, propose built bike frames. They have torque sensing pedal assist. They have s pedelec speed. 

2. I can't say I've been disappointed by anything but if I could choose one aspect to improve it would be hard to pass up some more low-end torque for climbing, but not at the expense of speed on the top end.

4. When I was shopping I decided I wanted class 3 speed and then went looking for the best value out there, instead of setting my price range and then trying to find the best performance I could get for that money. So I guess I value performance over all."

ebikes,ff563cb,t3_erpabh,1579581282.0,You go by cycles. Most batteries you'll see will say something like 800 charge cycles before depleted to 80% capacity. While I've had my ebike for a year and a half now I upgraded to a 52v battery a few months ago so I've never come close to reaching that point myself even though I ride daily. I'm guessing that 80% capacity is when you start to notice a marked decrease in mileage.
