AskAnAmerican,ff1r5ev,t1_fezn9vk,1579484362.0,"European here. To be sure, America has some superior quality cheese (wasn’t an American cheese voted the world’s best recently?!). However, I think what Europeans try to get at is that the average consumer in the US is not likely to consume average quality cheese, as is the case in Europe, but somewhat lower quality cheese, as it’s the most commercially available. Same with the bread example. Sure, there’s a wealth of choice in America, more so than Europe, but the most widespread food products are lesser in quality than those widespread food products in Europe, if that makes sense?

Furthermore, Americans are more likely than Europeans call out any attempt at seeking higher quality food products as ‘pretentious’, which is a term I often encountered in the US. It’s as if people try hard to be in this desirable state of ‘down-to-earthiness’."

She sounds respectful and not clingy at all. However, she rightfully felt like she was felt left out of a major change in your life. There’s a difference between doing Amsterdam sightseeing separately and one of you going through a major change on the sly.

In your defense, it wasn’t a big thing, and even if it was, you wanted it to be a surprise eventually. You might have prefaced that reunion with a text like, ‘I’ve got a big surprise for you. Hope you’ll appreciate it’. Maybe that way she would’ve felt like she was included in the plan, if that makes sense."
