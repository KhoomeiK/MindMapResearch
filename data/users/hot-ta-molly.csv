ThriftStoreHauls,fdfrn9d,t3_el30nn,1578368526.0,"My dad got me a mirror like this at garage sale and turned it into a giant chalkboard! It was beautiful, and so is yours!"
AskWomen,fdezz82,t1_fdeyytv,1578350223.0,"I pointed it out one time how annoying it is to me when someone says they have a pet named Molly (cause it happens almost every time I introduce myself). And a girl in the group whispered under her breath that her dog is named Molly. 
It was funny"
AskWomen,fdeysxl,t1_fde30sz,1578349489.0,"GIRL SAME, but my name is Molly. Everybody has a dog, cow, or horse named Molly"
AirBnB,fcx94nw,t1_fcx8nca,1578056057.0,Like I previously said I will be editing it when I get home today to remove that part. Thank you for your input though

AirBnB,fcwxlem,t1_fcwwiry,1578041949.0,"Maybe so, I do watch a lot of crime shows/movies. Thank you for bringing that to light though, I appreciate the honesty. I thought with Airbnb that all the owners of the house would be screened. Not just the one holding the Airbnb account. So I was taken aback when I found out all of this, on top of everything else that had already happened."
AirBnB,fcwvcr9,t1_fcwuwde,1578039161.0,"That’s my feelings too, but it has me feeling like a shitty ass person being manipulated like this by someone. I just do not understand how she doesn’t see what she did.. 

She has a different woman as the main host now and she is cohosting. So I assume they might split the compensation, but I could be completely wrong. Just going off of what I have seen on the profile.. idk how that all works."
AirBnB,fcwv4jn,t1_fcwuvnn,1578038890.0,"In my mind, since it’s half his house too he could have his friends come over, could have drug money hidden in it, weapons, anything that Ppl could come looking for, that I want no part of.."

AskRedditAfterDark,fctqt93,t1_fctqnlx,1577954734.0,That’s a good idea! I do actually have a small box that I could use. Thank you!
AskRedditAfterDark,fctfpx5,t1_fctes6l,1577941803.0,"I looked into that one but ended up getting something else. It’s not technically panties. It’s an insert for your underwear, but I didn’t know how to phrase without getting too wordy. But I’m not looking for advice on what to get. Just how to present it to him and making it fun for the night.."
