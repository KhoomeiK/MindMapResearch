I didn't cry when I watched Violet Evergarden the first time through.  A few months later I watched episode 1 again while showing it to my friend at a convention. As soon as the music played I started tearing up. This was unexpected to me.  I guess I formed an emotional connection to the music without realizing it.

After he finished writing the script the first person he sent it to was the singer of the band Radwimps (the band that made the music for ""Your Name"").  The script inspired the singer to make two songs that he sent to Makoto Shinkai 3 months later.  Those songs in turn inspired Makoto shinkai how to make the movie (like a positive feedback loop) and were included in it.

There were short cameos of the main characters from ""Your Name"".  He jokingly said anyone that recognized them even though they weren't named was probably an otaku.

When the boy said [Weathering With You spoiler](/s ""I want you more than a blue sky"") Shinkai thought that would make some audience people agree and some people disagree.  Because it ignored the needs of the community.

Shinkai said his last two movies benefitted from happy coincidences.  When he started making ""Your Name"" Studio Ghibli had recently disbanded and those animators prefered making films over TV anime so they moved over to his studio. He got a lot of talent as a result.  I forgot what the happy coincidence of ""Weathering With You"" was.

Makoto Shinkai said he knew one of the dialogue lines (which I won't say despite the spoiler warning above) would make some people think ""I agree with that"" or ""I disagree with that"" but that was because he thought real life Japanese kids were stifled (from romance? stifled via peer pressure? via culture? He didn't specify) not because he had something to say about climate change.

Here's what I meant by the theory/practice thing.  Communism sounds like a utopia *in theory* but every time it's been tried it always turns out the same: equally distributed misery instead of equally distributed wealth (money *is* equal but it doesn't help), lots of death, the government controlling everything, and instead the public having power like communism promises it's concentrated in a few people but without the power to vote them out of office if you don't like them.

And it's atheist.  I don't know what ""equally distributed wealth"" has to do with religion but that often happens too for some reason.  I know China squashes churches because they see them as a threat to their control of the public, but I can't comment on other communist countries.
