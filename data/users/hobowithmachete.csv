Karting,fffcpch,t1_fff6vin,1579881064.0,"Practice can mean different things.  If you're just learning to drive, its a time to put to use what you've learned, and to refine and perfect your driving skills.  It allows you the time to experiment with what works for you, whether it be experimenting with lines, braking points, hand position on the steering wheel, anything.

You can go out and 'spar' with a friend and do the overcut, undercut exercises, just go all out and race each other, push each other around a bit.  Pretty valuable experience.

If you are experienced, practice is not only for continuing to be perfect but for figuring out a general set up for your kart.  

On a race weekend, your track time is limited, thus you can't try out as many different set ups as you would like.  When you go to a practice day leading up to a race weekend, you can get baseline set up in similar conditions and during the race weekend, you make minor tweaks adapt the kart to the current conditions.  It is very time effective.  

If you're a club member you either get use of the track included in your dues, or reduced cost.  You can either pay for half or full day use at some tracks."

There is SO much rubber laid down in that area, the surface is literally polished with rubber.  When that gets wet and a car goes on there, it's about the same as driving on ice."
Karting,ffem9pc,t3_et6sgj,1579854164.0,"First and foremost, let's talk money.

Being 15, this is gonna be more of a cost on your parents than it will be on you.  This isn't a sport like snowboarding where you buy all the equipment and then go rip down hills all winter.  In karting, everything costs money and it isn't cheap.  You have to consider storing and transporting the kart, consumables (gas, oil, tires, lubricants, cleaning agents, etc.), a good set of tools and specialty tools, as well as needing a variety of spare parts for tuning the kart/replacing stuff when it breaks.  Unless you already have a wealth of knowledge on how a kart works, you're sometimes going to have to pay someone to help you figure it out when something goes wrong.  

Now let's talk kart types and different levels of racing.

Kart classes range from different price points and performance aspects.  As a 15 year old, you would be racing in a senior class (fully unrestricted engine for ages 15-30).  The cost and difficulty to drive are mutually exclusive.

Lo206 - Low cost, low maintenance, 4-stroke club level racing that is accessible to many, and a good place to learn how to properly drive a kart, and practice your racecraft.  

TaG (Touch and Go) - a 2 stroke 125cc, single speed kart (most popular engines/series being Iame X30, or Rotax), which is kind of middle of the road budget and maintenance, but does require skill and experience to be quick.  Popular across all levels of racing  (club, regional and national/international) level racing. 

Shifter karts (classified as KF1/KF2) - 2 stroke, 125cc purpose built kart racing engines with 6 speeds.  The fastest and most difficult to master.  Also expensive to start, costly to maintain, and they must be constantly maintained/rebuilt to be competitive.  Popular in national and international professional kart racing.  They require an expert level of skill to be quick in.

I mentioned different levels of racing as well.  Club level racing is a championship held at your local kart track(s).  Regional racing is more competitive, requires more travelling around your region to different tracks.  National level racing is racing around the continental U.S. against the top kart racers in not just the USA, but North America.  International racing takes place in Europe, with the CIK-FIA world championship holding rounds at kart tracks across western Europe.  

Now lets talk commitment.

Starting from scratch, you need to learn how to drive a kart properly.  Read about it, watch youtube, maybe meet someone at your local track that would be okay spending some time with you on helping you figure it out.  Just try to recognize any bad habits you may be forming and nip those in the bud.  Once you've got the basics nailed down (racing line, cornering, braking, accelerating, etc.), practice, practice, practice.  Then practice some more.  You're going to be exhausted after the first couple of practice days, but your body will get used to it.  Not only do you need to learn how to drive the kart, you need to learn how the kart reacts to changes you make to it.  Learn what it feels like if the kart is too gripped up, or too loose, and experiment with what changes need to be made to the chassis to get the kart to handle the way you want it to.  When in doubt, ask for advice.  People in the paddock are generally very friendly and willing to help out.

To get a better idea of how accessible karting is to you in your area, look up your nearest kart club (look up your address on google, then using the 'nearby' search just look for kart track), head out there on a race weekend or a practice day (the schedule should be on their website), and start asking questions.  Sometimes, kart racing shops can rent a kart/support to you for the day to try it out, to see if you like it.  They're also an excellent source of knowledge in helping you find what works for you in terms of experience and budget.

Hope this helps, and good luck!"
