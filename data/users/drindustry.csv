AmItheAsshole,ffarhg1,t1_ff94u4j,1579742783.0,He didn't say 15 hour round trip
AmItheAsshole,ffapftc,t1_ff94bdt,1579741404.0,"Because he is not going to drive 60 hours in one week. Say he leaves friday at 5pm (assuneing he works 9-5) he will show up at the moms house at 7 am saturday morning then assuming he leaves right away he will bring the kids back home at 9PM. Assuming he turns right back around another 15 hour drive will get the kids back to mom at 11 am sunday morning then he will have to drive another 15 hours back. Getting him home at 2am monday morning allowing for around 6 hours of sleep after being up for 2+ days.

But let's assume the trip Is 15 hours round trip. He leaves at 5PM friday afternoon and gets the kids back home at 7am Saturday morning. Then to make sure the kids get back home so he can go to work monday morning he would have to leave at 7PM on sunday getting him back to work at 9am. So that leaves 36 hours to spend with his kids assuming no body needs sleep and he is fine leaveing straight from work and going straight to work after dropping the kids off."

Political_Revolution,fc4h1al,t1_fc3x5l9,1577416422.0,"You know I almost wrote pro white anit people of color racism but it felt clunky and I felt that you had the ability to look at context clues and figure that out but I guess not (or you are argueing in bad faith)


You also cut out a very important line when you quoted me. I said if you are a racist (and again I am referring to pro white anit people of color racism) and race is an important issue to you I'm willing to be your not a Democrat. If you dont see the difference between those two statements you ether have poor english reading comprehension or you are argueing in bad faith. 

But to play your guessing game.

The first article I'm guessing she doesn't vote (btw I disagree with about 90% of what she has to say.)

The writer of the second article could go ether way (I agree with him for the most part)

As for the subject of the third article well I would agree Democrat is more likely then Republican but I'm guessing he supports a third party. (Of course I disagree with killing white people)"
