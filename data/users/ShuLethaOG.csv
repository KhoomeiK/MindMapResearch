Wellthatsucks,feb1jxj,t3_eobhl7,1578954547.0,"Oh no! That SUCKS!

Something similar happened to a friend of mine a few years ago, a server at a restaurant in New Orleans. After she was done with her shift she wrapped her guest check wallet with all her tip money for that night in her apron and threw it on the kitchen counter when she got home. The next morning she woke up to find that her dog ATE THE WHOLE DAMN WALLET - money and all.

The same dog also ate an entire King Cake including the baby and had the shits for a week.

It sucks but...it was obviously memorable!"

nfl,fc21cqv,t3_efqzio,1577336574.0,Completely agree on both counts but remember that Joe freaking Flacco won a super bowl - give Andy D and that offense a strong D and they can do well. Is he a long term solution? Probably not. But it buys the franchise some time.
