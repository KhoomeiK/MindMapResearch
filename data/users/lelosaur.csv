Those are geared towards not just helping you find what you're looking for, but buying other stuff that catches your eye, incidentally strategically placed at eye level. At both eye level for kids and adults. Notice how sugary cereals and candy are often placed at a child's eye level as well as adult's. It's all pretty crazy in it's own way"

An op could just be saying that they were videotaping a friend, hence third person. You have to explicitly express that it's a repost. Yes, I'm frustrated. I'm an artist myself. I've also seen plenty of friends have their work stolen and posted on Reddit, Instagram, and other places with no explicit statement or link back to them. All for karma, clout, followers, ect. It's a huge problem, and people like you don't make this any better. Creative content belongs to the owners. Treat their work with respect."

sousvide,feaw7l3,t1_feaqfsm,1578952810.0,"I respect the articles and effort put forth. However, the furthest point of testing seems to be only his taste buds, as compared to scientific articles where they'll hold fat samples of different grade meats at the same temp+time, and still lose more fat from the a5 meat. Which leads me to believe it's a confirmation bias, since an a5 with lots of fat rendered out will still have much more fat and flavor than any prime grade beef."
sousvide,fe9ofsl,t1_fe9mspe,1578939972.0,"Generally the term categorically begs the need to actually state said categorical points of falsehood. That being said, /u/afropat is right here. If you did a basic Google search of why this occurs, you'll notice a plethora of well documented studies describing how beef with higher concentrations of intramuscular fat tend to display increasingly larger amounts of oelic acid, which has a direct correlation to amount of fat lost at the same temps as compared to beef with lower intramuscular fat. Especially since oelic acid directly lowers the melting point of fats. Meaning, you're going to lose more fat in wagyu at the same temp sous vide as compared to your regular store bought beef. Hope that was enough basis in reality for you."
sousvide,fe9d90e,t3_eo5xsu,1578936525.0,"Wagyu fat has a much lower melting temp than regular beef. You probably noticed it melting already as you handled it. To add on to that, it's already super tender, reducing the need for any sort of poaching. So if you sous vide that, you're going to render out and lose all that amazing fat REALLY quickly. A quick sear on both sides after seasoning is really all you need here."
