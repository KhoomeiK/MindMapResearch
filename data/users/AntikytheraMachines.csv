EUNI pays at the very least for any skill book under 1m ISK.

Horde gives you a shuttle filled with skill books and a heap of starting ships and will replace those ships indefinitely just for the asking. They also have plenty of ways for new players to start making an income to support themselves in the future.

you should have been given a Thrasher destroyer (assuming Minmatar)

I'd suggest fit it with long range weapons, ships bonus is for projectile, so Artillery.  two reasons: 1) you use your speed and range to minimise incoming damage. and more importantly 2) you can engage at much longer range so don't have to take time to get close. many low level missions you can lock, blap, lock, blap etc and so finish very quickly, if you have long range weapons.
