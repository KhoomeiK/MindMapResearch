But since I was referring to the first case on Unsolved Mysteries I saw in particular... the case they covered happened in early Aug. 88.

Thetruthishere,ff210mr,t1_ff1oumu,1579490919.0,I've met family members of friends before I even met them in my dream state that I consider just our souls meeting. I never even interacted with all the parents & siblings later even if I did see them in real life other than a quick intro. But when I was talking to them in the dream state they were telling me what the friend would do or how they would treat me. It's not just your family you pick. It continues throughout your life.

I've had too many ""not really a dream"" flashes of other lives to deny what I myself as a toddler said though. I wasn't even told I said these things when I started to talk until my Aunt & Uncle too me to Sunday school w/my cousins. An older cousin said they were talking about reincarnation. And they both said from the front seat ""Oh that happened to him!"" I was like - What did!?!
I asked my youngest cousin if she had any old memories, from Before Now? She said she remembered a being on a plane & the stewardesses had long dresses. I said wow, that Was a long time ago. Awhile back I saw a post of American Airlines first group of flight attendants & they had the long dresses."

When I first learned how to speak, I told my parents my name from my last life & the state I had lived in. Since then I've had dreams about my passed relatives & I take other now currently living people to meet them. We wake with overlapping recall of the events. I usually drive a car, but sometimes they do. So this could be how you recall getting here."
AskReddit,feygt31,t1_feww15l,1579445334.0,"Yup. My Grandfather would always watch the same documentaries Over & Over & Over, every night on A&E(which was basically a precursor to the History channel) then one Christmas my parents bought him a VCRplus literally had the ability to poke in 5 numbers instead of setting channel & start/end times. I went on vacation w/the Grandparents on a Florida vacation for that New Years. And heard him telling his brother in law basically that my parents just bought him a piece of junk he'd never use."

Thetruthishere,febtn0v,t3_eo9not,1578962589.0,"I moved into my Grandmothers house after my Grandfather passed. The occurrences started one of the first nights. The first was I had my arm up on my head w/my hand resting on the back of it. Behind/beside where my hand was on the exact center of my skull I had a hard knuckle smack. My hand hadn't moved. My arms or legs would lift straight up or out. Opposite of any kind involuntary muscle movements. When your body twitches you can feel it happen. I was on his EZ chair in the front room, my leg lifted straight up. The tv blasted on a weird channel of static. Back when that was possible. Remote was out of reach. One Saturday morning I was asleep on the couch. I was being tickled awake, thinking I'd see grandmother nudging me I cracked an eyelid. No one was there but my shirt on my chest was being moved by the pressure that tickled me. I said I'm awake. It slowly stopped. Eventually after a year or two I stopped responding/reacting. It all stopped. One day a few months later, she asked me if anything weird ever happened to me during the night. As in, it had moved on over into her room. I'm pretty certain it was him. Bc one time early on I was in the bathroom & I heard whistling, like he always would do. Grandmother never whistled, she had partial dentures. She always hummed or sang. The family legend before he passed was a cat had kittens that died... and if you slept in that room they would attack your fingers or toes. So something was happening before he passed but I know I got the smack on the head from him."
