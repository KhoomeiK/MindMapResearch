There were only meat grinders like the Western Front and Gallipoli. 

That’s not to say that there aren’t fascinating stories to tell. Read Jeff Shaara’s *To the Last Man*. It tells the story of the first fighter pilots including the Red Baron, as well as the brief but no less intense American campaign.

His off the cuff remarks are never consistent with the statements written for him afterward. His off the cuff remarks such as making fun of a disabled reporter and actions such as appointing Pence show who he really is. It’s why racists, homophobes, and xenophobes love him. 

Omar made anti-Israel remarks that people twisted into anti-Semitic comments. Of course someone like Duke praised her in that light. No, neither she nor her supporters are racist because anti-Israel =/= anti-Semite. It’s only racists who are twisting her words for their own beliefs."
