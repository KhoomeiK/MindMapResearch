I do feel like however there is a yearning from humans to want to be mad at something that makes sense. we can become puritanical with our beliefs and our justifications and our moral outrage. We want to be mad at someone, to know who to protect ourselves from. This is [potentially hardwired into us, to an extent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number).

Now take a step back from all of that charged stuff. People who are obese are considered ""safe"" targets from the media.

Plus, it's not even something that you can give up cold turkey in the way that you could do with, say, tobacco.. most cases of obesity have multiple issues so you can't even give quippy response.

Bev - love and connections don't have to hurt, breaking cycles of abuse, embracing her own feminity (fear of blood and all) 

Ben - the builder, I found his musings on the library, why he was sort of a scholar for the group but separate from Mike stemming from him specifically being so lonely. 

Mike - the true historian, and also the biggest target for Henry. I am glad he got to be with the group though. Also I liked the nod to Hallorann? Not necessary sure but wouldve been neat. Also a lot of people missed that his parents weren't actually crackheads, so some clarification would help. 

Richie - he overthinks but also knows the group best. I felt having him be queer was neat (though weirdly I used to think Eddie was the closeted person - not the cliche no sex except for Mom stand-in, more the general germaphobe except Richie). 

Eddie - he almost got over his fears, but not quite is a weird, and resonant theme for me. Idk. Also didn't suffer as much, I guess, compared to the other losers.

I agree with you to a point (you're not wrong to me but I think we need more representation of different shapes to help with that), and yeah.

ContraPoints,fe4hmaa,t1_fe4hdrw,1578859417.0,"You opened with ""I'm not convinced that the majority weren't shills"". 

So you do sound like you think that to me."
ContraPoints,fe4fzdv,t1_fe4ezgl,1578858892.0,"I think it's also a bit if a.... hopeful thinking to think it's *all* bad faith. A puritanical mindset is unfortunately what the US was built on, as Atwood theorized for the handmaid's tale. It's easy to fall into, and we can do it on the left just like the right. you've never decided that something might be too problematic after hearing about someone else thinking it's too problematic? 

I know that I've found myself wondering that about certain comedians. ""Should I like this comedian...? because what they say can be a bit gauche..."" And trying to find info, to know if I can feel totally good about liking them. That's a newer version of my older puritanical mindset. 

Also I know that I've heard past vaguely-witty quote back some things that contrapoints is pointed out oblivious centrists and also people with bad faith arguments both say. So I know at least I used to be kinda like that, and I'm a pretty basic bitch. 

So, again, you're not totally wrong. But also I trust what Natalie is saying, and I've seen it too. I've been that person (I didn't attack like this to people but I've been the ""enlightened centrist"").

Edit in: and circling back to my argument about wondering if someone is problematic and only looking for info from someone else on that, and your issue with Michael Jackson. I think someone saying I've seen and read this news information for myself and I just don't care for that artist for x reasons, that's different then say me hearing or reading ""Burt kreishner racist!"" and just googling ""Burt kreishner racist?"" And getting a post where someone boils down thoughts and theories to dissect, and label (like that makeup guy) also, me using the debate to begin a process of looking up info? Also, that's good. That's me being informed. But me bandwagoning and just screaming it too? Not necessarily. Mob justice isn't always right. 

Also also, just labeling everybody who does that as someone who's secretly on the right and is always arguing in bad faith isn't necessarily doing us a good thing? I'm not telling you it's pushing them away but it can feel hurtful and very confusing for that person. It helped me a lot to hear Nat point out it's also obliviousness."
aww,fe4ctrc,t3_enpg8i,1578857963.0,Predator confusion
ContraPoints,fe4c25z,t1_fe46y9s,1578857721.0,"I see what you're saying and I agree to an extent. I feel like a lot of people who complain about cancel culture are people who are upset that they're being held to standards. Look at Louis CK and Seinfeld (i don't remember his first name). they're upset that college kids don't think that they're funny and they're losing  their topicality. Louis CK is also actively trying to appeal to the right now making fun of the parkland kids. 

But, didn't you see the weaponization of canceling on Contra? We aren't always examining ourselves, sometimes we are also dabbling in and indulging our puritanical behavior. We just think that we're doing it towards people who deserve it because we're going after morality instead of something like skin color.

Also, crazy tinfoil hat time, sometimes people on the right seem to be actively encouraging this - inviting and trying to force us to cancel people with their bad faith. Look at James Gunn."

TheHandmaidsTale,fdx24wm,t1_fdwlxps,1578764540.0,The book also references a stint teaching so it's really not that different. especially when you also consider that Atwood has said that she was working on a sequel since the 90s.
