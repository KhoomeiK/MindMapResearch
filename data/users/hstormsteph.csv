I walked in and said “Oh wow I didn’t know there was one of these in Chapel Hill!” My response was met with “Uhhhhh...sir? You’re in Salisbury.” They let me charge my phone and call my friends who sent me some money for gas to make it back, as I had spent all the money I brought at the party/bars the night before.

I was already mid shit and since that moment I check under the toilet seat, in those corners and I even flush the toilet first go make sure he’s not hidden under the rim every single time before I put myself in a “compromising position”.

NEET,feo7380,t1_feo3sfb,1579295968.0,"So Messi was born an absolute all star? He could do what he does if he never busted his ass training? Bullshit. 

Hard work does nothing on its own? Completely false. While you still need to work smart, sometimes working your ass off is the smart thing to do. Know when a particular job isn’t worth it but bust your ass with the ones that are. There’s always an idiot that makes more. Take a look at our president. Doesn’t mean you can’t be successful too. I’ve built the social connections leading to a better job *because* people noticed how hard I work. By your logic with genetic futility, Em should’ve never been able to make it. There were absolutely zero hardworking or talented genes in his family. 

I have a distorted perception of reality? Don’t kid yourself bud. Making more and more money is a high. You’re right about that. Chasing that high is what just turned my household into a 6 figure income household. It’s why I won’t have to skip meals anymore or be late on bills. It makes all the bullshit I put up with worth it. I don’t have to do manual labor anymore. 

Make fun of wageslaves all you want, but don’t ever bitch about wanting to be able to “make it” if you’re gonna do nothing to achieve it.

NEET,feo0cks,t1_fenyeor,1579293440.0,"You’re missing the point of what I’m saying. The movie was centered around him building confidence. He built that confidence at his job. He got fed the fuck up doing that bullshit and dealing with his shit at home. His talent was built from his shit home life as a kid. Staying inside literally reading the dictionary and using rap as a means of escape. He wrote songs on his way to work. Was he blessed with talent? Yes but in the same breath no. He built that shit. Gave it everything he had. He never had the confidence to put it out there until these little battles. Did we watch the same movie? 

As far as “the stupidest shit you’ve ever read” I’ve been a wageslave for a decade and because of that I just got a job making over double what I’ve ever made. Hard work opens crazy doors. It fuckin blows, I know. But it’s the truth. I almost gave up after making 9 bucks an hour for years and trying to pay rent and bills on 1100 bucks a month. Just don’t give up man."
NEET,fenxmt8,t3_eq4khs,1579292337.0,You realize part of what helped him build his skill and confidence in that movie was him being at that awful job right? The little battles he got into while they were on lunch break. He also built a good friendship with his coworker to the point where he covered his shift for him so he could compete in that final battle at The Shelter. Working that bullshit job arguably helped set him up to break out of his circumstances. Sometimes gritting your teeth and being a wageslave opens up great opportunities.

Vape_Porn,femtyuf,t3_eprgi3,1579269527.0,"Generally, vapes are usually factory charged about 30-50% of the way. Depending on how long it’s been since it left the factory, the battery may have drained from sitting. If there is any charge however, a good rule of thumb for preserving the overall lifespan of rechargeable batteries is to drain them *completely* before charging to full power. This keeps the battery from developing a “memory” of what it will register as fully charged/drained. Hope this helps!"
