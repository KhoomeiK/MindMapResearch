> Breeder reactors are able to use previous generation's waste as fuel. This reduces both the volume of waste and how long it is dangerous for (brings it to a few hundred years instead of a few thousand).

Cool, didn't know that. I guess my country can then stop moving the existing waste around and stop searching for some kind of final storage none of our states want to build, and just sell it to someone operating a breeder reactor.   
Although [This list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_reactors) has currently no operating breeder reactors listed, world-wide. Excluded are those not providing power for the civilian sector, so those are probably either military or research reactors.

Und das meine ich damit, dass eine stark typisierte Sprache für einen Anfänger sinnvoller ist. Dadurch wird man weniger auf wilde Fehlersuche geschickt, da der Code schon beim Schreiben öfter als falsch markiert wird, wenn das nicht wirklich sinnvoll ist, was geschrieben wurde."
FragReddit,ffglfr6,t1_ffgbc75,1579908958.0,"> Erste Begründungen für JS: schnelle, motivierende Ergebnisse. Programmierparadigmen, die dich in genau die Denkmuster versetzen, die du brauchst um verteilte Systeme zu verstehen und zu bauen. 

Mein Grund gegen JS als eine der ersten Programmiersprachen:  

Es ist wesentlich einfacher Fehler zu machen, die keine Syntax-Fehler sind, aber einfach nicht so funktionieren wie erwartet.  
Zum Beispiel einfach ein Taschenrechner. Füge zwei Textfelder ein, lies die Werte aus und führe eine Subtraktion durch.

`el1.value - el2.value` - Eingabe ist jeweils `2`, Ergebnis ist wie erwartet `0`. Super!  
Dann addieren wir das ganze mal:  
`el1.value + el2.value` - Eingabe wieder jeweils `2`, Ergebnis ist ... `22`?! Joah, vergessen, dass das ja Textfelder sind und keine Zahlfelder. Also entweder mit `Number()` abrufen oder die Felder zu Zahlenfeldern machen.  

Ich schreibe selber jeden Arbeitstag JavaScript, nutze aber für komplexere Module TypeScript. Ich habe einen Kollegen, der peu á peu Programmieren lernt, und sich dafür JavaScript ausgesucht hat. Bei fast jedem Problem, das er bisher hatte, hat es ausgereicht seinen Code als TypeScript lesen zu lassen um rauszufinden, wo er falsche Typen verwendet hat.  
Sei es, dass er da einen `string` als `number` verwenden will, dass er einen Getter geschrieben hat und dann die Funktion statt dem zurückgegebenen Wert versucht zu übergeben, oder dass Werte einfach zur Laufzeit noch nicht definiert oder initialisiert wurden und der `!= null`-check fehlte.

JavaScript hat da meiner Meinung nach für einen Anfänger viel zu viele Situationen wo der Code zwar syntaktisch korrekt ist, aber nicht das macht, was der Programmierer eigentlich will. Daher dann lieber mit einer Programmiersprache mit festeren Strukturen anfangen lassen, die einem auch schneller sagen kann was falsch sein könnte.

FragReddit,ffgjlif,t1_fff8ju1,1579907729.0,"Der Hauptvorteil wenn man mit Sprachen mit fester Typisierung anfängt ist, dass man dann nicht anfängt Dinge zu lernen, die einem dann später Fehler verursachen, beziehungsweise dafür sorgen, dass Fehler schwerer zu finden sind.

JS zeigt schließlich beim Füllen keinen Fehler an.  
Der Fehler lag aber im Endeffekt dadrin, dass JavaScript-Arrays von Haus aus nur Zahlen als Array-Index erkennt. Was der PHP-Entwickler hier getan hat ist der Eigenschaft ""key"" des Arrays einen Wert zuzuweisen, und nicht den Wert an der Stelle ""key"" in das Array einzufügen, wie es in z.B. PHP geht. Ist aber natürlich trotzdem noch gültiges JavaScript und man kommt an den Wert auch immernoch ran, entweder indem man den Schlüssel direkt abruft oder über `for...in` - wobei letzteres auch wieder mit Fallstricken verbunden ist."

Alternatively, you could also raise this issue with your teachers or the administration. They should be able to fix this, and should do this especially because it impacts your whole class.

Also, I'm not sure if you need admin privileges for altering the PATH system variable for your user, or if it persists between reboots. But you could try that one, too."
AskReddit,feppaa3,t1_fepkojm,1579326803.0,">> PoE just doesn't want players to experiment with builds.

>Of course it is. PoE's system is amazingly varied and flexible compared to similar games. At the core, it's a game about building characters. What it is not is a theme park game where you can fuck around. It's fine if that's not for you but don't pretend it's a problem with the game itself.

I never doubt that the passive skill system is varied and flexible. That much is evident for everyone who ever glanced at the skill tree. But I think we have different interpretations of ""being able to experiment"" - If I have to invest several evening just to try out a skillset and how it works in later stages of the game, that actually discourages me from experimenting. Is that actually fun for you, not progressing far because you have to start over when you want to try something differently? Because it isn't for me.

And I'm not saying it's a problem with the game. I'm saying it's a problem I have with the game. I like experimenting and trying out new stuff. Doing everything the same way gets boring for me. PoE doesn't seem to offer much variation once you start investing into a specific build, so it gets boring for me and I start to lose interest. Especially if I try out something new once in a while, find it fun at first and then drop the game when I realize how much time I would have to put into a new character just to get as far as I currently am."

And even when I already have a nice grasp of the game, I like to experiment with the possibilities a game has to offer. If I find a more fun way to play, it's all good, but if it ends up less fun and I can't go back to my original build, that's awful and a gamebreaker for me.

There was a situation just like this in my last playthrough: For most of it, I played a DoT build and went through the game fine. Shortly before I unlocked the Scion, I found a Vaal skill gem that would be fine in an instant damage build, and as I hadn't found any Vaal gems complementing my DoT build, I tried it out. And that skill, together with a short-range teleportation skill to get close to enemies, was a lot of fun to use. But I simply couldn't beat the boss of that chapter because I was skilled for DoTs and had not nearly enough respec points and regret orbs to reskill properly. So I switched back to the DoT skills, finished the chapter and dropped the playthrough, because the DoT build was boring now that I had tried out the other skills.

PoE just doesn't want players to experiment with builds. Select a build early on, and if it's not the most fun way to play, well shucks. Roll a new character, invest a couple more dozen hours!  

Contrast this with e.g. Monster Hunter World. I tried all weapons in the beginning, settled on the Charge Blade and finished the main quests of the initial game with that.  
Recently started up the game again to play with a friend. Wanted to mix things up a bit, so I picked up a few other types of weapons and found out that I actually like Kinsect Glaives, too. Took a bit to collect all the materials for that build, but since I didn't have to destroy my Charge Blades, I can switch back whenever I like. And I can always craft other weapons to experiment with new stuff."

They don't say to anybody, they explicitly mention that they'll only do that to comply with government demands or if you use their services maliciously.

Extra content added in patches targetting citizens of specific countries is possible too. If for example some south american country wanted to go ""north korea way"" today, and gave 100 billions of dollars to microsoft adding patch acting as rootkit, sending data at non obvious times they could probably get almost perfect control over society. After its discovery many users would not give the crap, others would say they cannot afford to escape windows, anothers would say its ""fair"" etc.

It's not only Microsoft that has this capability, there are a lot of companies that have a say in what your PC does or doesn't do.  
For example, did you know that in 2015 Lenovo was caught loading a BIOS section reserved for drivers with their crapware installers? Everytime you reinstalled Windows or uninstalled their crap, everything would reinstall on the next reboot.  
Last year some graphics driver was infected with some kind of malware that only activated on specific MACs, probably targeting a company or something like that.  
Microsoft is also not the only one who could theoretically be bribed like that - With the rise of mobile devices (example: W3Counter reports that only ~29% of web browser visits were made with Windows 7, 10 or Mac OSX in [December 2019](https://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php?year=2019)), I'd be a lot more concerned about Android - especially since phone providers can distribute updates and thus a malicious government wouldn't even have to involve outside companies.  

Also, Microsoft would lose a lot of reputation if they would take money to push malicious patches. I know of quite a few sys admins here who are already annoyed because they have to stop Windows 10 on company devices from phoning home. Right now, it's unfeasible to migrate everything to Linux or MacOS, but if they started pulling shit like that, I'm sure you'd actually start to see a ""year of the Linux desktop"".

Every software with admin privileges can potentially spy on you. Every driver has even deeper access to your system. To be sure you aren't getting spied on, you'd have to turn away from electronic devices completely."

E.g. in my last game I found a skill that was more fun to use shortly before the boss where you first unlock the scion. But since my skills were built in a way contrasting that skill, I lost a lot damage and survivability. IIRC I played a DoT-build and found a Vaal gem (this was the trigger to me trying that gem, while I dismissed it earlier in the game) that dealt more instant damage, combined with some teleportation melee skill that was pretty fun, but I couldn't hold my own against the boss with that. Reskilling into crit/attack speed wasn't really feasible with the amount of Regret Orbs and passive respecs I had, so I eventually dropped the game again when I finished that chapter.  

Recently I wanted to start another playthrough, but (probably foolishly, but I had her unlocked only in the game before) selected the Scion. Looking at the skill tree after I got my first few skill points, I had no idea what to skill into, especially since I hadn't found any especially fun gems yet. So I dropped that again.  

It just feels as if the game really wants to punish you for experimenting with different play styles, stopping you from getting a bit of variation. But that's what I actually like to do. E.g. I recently picked up Monster Hunter World again, and I nearly exclusively used the Charge Blade (Basically a sword&shield combo, which can transform into a greataxe to deal heavy damage) for the whole game. That was getting a bit boring, so I quickly crafted a few high-level Glaives and Dual Blades, and now I get to vary my play style a lot more, to adapt it on the enemy I'm going to fight, whether or not I'm in a group, or how I feel at the time. Initially I dismissed Glaives, because it felt like a chore to keep its buffs up and seemed to have a very low damage output, but with some stronger gear that prolonged the buff duration and my experience in the game now, I find it more fun to play than the Charge Blade against certain monsters.

Even in Diablo 3 I regularly switched up my skills and tried out different, new things; some I stuck with, some I stopped using shortly after. I also kept several different sets in my loadouts and used whatever I fancied.

    WWWWFWWWW
    FFWFFFWFF
    FFFFFFFFF
    FFWFFFWFF

This way if you position your pawns at the intersections, you can always fight the bugs 3v1. If one of your pawns get incapacitated, you retreat to the next indentation. If all bugs in the current section are downed or killed, you move forward to the next enemies.  
You can also position ranged combatants behind the frontline, but that occasionally results in friendly fire.  

I have only very rarely suffered losses from this tactic. Rarely your pawns can lose a limb or an eye/nose/ear, but that also sets you up for a new sub-story to help that pawn become able again.

Most of the losses I sustained here were from downed pawns bleeding out. I then learned that it's good to have a fast pawn on hand to grab the downed pawn and take him to the hospital while the rest retreats. Also, to keep a backup hospital in  a different part of the base (in my case, a stockpile of meds near most bedrooms and a quick repurpose of one or more beds).

BaseBuildingGames,fd9lpvc,t1_fd8vwwm,1578235057.0,"> Although I just remembered, you can advance past the area designation stage when furnishing and thus get to the furniture to get a look at their size.

I just noticed that after I tried to design a room in an unbuilt building, that's definitely helping. Although when placing stuff it seems there are more rules other than that all colored furniture cells have to be in the building - is it also checking that each tile of the room is still reachable perhaps?"
BaseBuildingGames,fd8rwu6,t1_fd2l2pa,1578222541.0,"Regarding rooms, what annoyed me a bit was that I first had to build an indoor area, then design the room that I want in it. When building the walls and ceiling, I have no idea how much space the furniture will take, so during the time I played, I regularly had to expand buildings and try again with the new room size.  

This could be alleviated if a room automatically built walls and ceiling if outside.  

Or I missed something and you can plan rooms in a planned building. Just comes to mind now, haven't tried that ingame yet."

Noticed on my Rime map that the bottom abyssalite border to the magma sea was interrupted and it was melting the rock and threatening to reach the oil. Patched that with some insulated ceramic and over several dozen circles the ceramic has probably only gone up to 65°C - the magma has >2000°C."
