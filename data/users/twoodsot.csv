Hunting,ffdjthz,t1_ffdfulc,1579822390.0,I would say most hunters do have great ethics but unfortunately most people aren't as clear with their perspective in conversation as Steven is. He is a true ambassador for conservation and hunters .

This day and age with all the videos on cops senselessly beating a suspect and they are still doing it. What gives.  Who's gonna teach them a lesson in abuse of power? O my bad, the perp should have just stopped in the first place. Then I wouldn't have had to beat him while he was cuffed. I can control my high testosterone rage if you comply correctly. But not if I have to chase you down. I don't think getting a beating is part of the judicial punishment that will inevitably be handed down."
