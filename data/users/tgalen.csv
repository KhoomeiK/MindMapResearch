AskNOLA,ffdi5jn,t3_esytp3,1579821368.0,"I stayed at the Crown Plaza New Orleans the first time I went, and it was fine, I'd stay again. You're right at the edge of Bourbon Street. I didn't think it was loud, and it was nice to be so close to the hotel at the end of the night."
Eloping,ffdhk1p,t1_ffdgtey,1579821009.0,"We used the company Simply Eloped, which gave me a few suggestions. They assigned me a photographer, and I was looking at her photos and one was of the bride walking a long these old train tracks. I knew wherever that was was what I wanted! There was this area in a park called City Park that had these nice old trees and bridges. It's a big park, more like Central Park, so there weren't a lot of people around. Felt surprisingly private!

We woke up in the morning at our AirBnB. Went out for biscuits. Then videographer and make up artist came.

After the ceremony we had champagne at a pretty bar then a fancy dinner.

Eloping,ffdfl7r,t1_ffd6gk5,1579819842.0,"Honestly I'm not 100% sure. Observation Deck...you might have people around, not sure you could reserve it. OMG but at night, how pretty would that be?! I would assume places like Bartrams Gardens or Morris Arboretum would allow it, but can't say for sure. I eloped in a public park (New Orleans) and didn't need anyones approval. 

There is a beautiful garden in Old City, I think it's called the 18th Century Garden, that I am obsessed with. I'd say it's worth calling any place you love. Elopements are so different from weddings, places that don't do weddings make be totally into a simple, small, elopement!"
