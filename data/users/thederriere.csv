Clean off the face of the Earth. A gun in your home or in your pocket won't change much.  


If you feel you are truly in danger, you do what most intelligent people have been doing for millenia...you move. Get out of that area, state, region, country...just get out and go somewhere where you will be safe. If you can't leave now, start making those plans."

If she cannot be empathetic without having a surprise pregnancy, I don't she'll be able to show the same empathy for situations she will never have to experience but are important nonetheless. I'm not punishing her. No one here is. But I don't think her views have really changed. Her situation has."
TwoXChromosomes,feyc0zf,t3_eqphay,1579443531.0,"I actually despise people like this. I'm not going to get personal with you, but it takes a special type of awful to hold such beliefs UNTIL the moment they negatively affect you. Nothing has changed, just your situation.

It shouldn't matter that you do or do not want to have a child. What should matter is that you, from jump, have the choice in carrying a pregancy to term or not.

You know what doesn't change? Race, sexuality, culture...Are you going to keep any other prejudiced views because you won't have to worry about them? I hope your change of heart isn't limited to reproductive choices."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fert1xl,t3_eqdcmz,1579358071.0,But it's never just standing up. They are always trying to open the overhead compartments and getting their bags even though they have been expressly asked NOT to do that. And then they stand carrying their heavy ass bag in the same spot for 10-15 minutes before deboarding.
expat,fdda1rn,t3_ekqmas,1578301908.0,"Have you tried working at vacation resorts? I'm not sure how they are on visas, but with the limited skills you have, I would try to choose something that caters to English-speaking visitors/tourists. You might get scammed or worse when you don't know the language of an area, and if your are provided housing, this gives you a base in the country."
expat,fcxsb38,t3_ejhht0,1578069702.0,"I just moved with mine to France and it was pretty complicated, but we survived! I believe the UK pet import laws are more complicated but I'll give you a rundown of what I needed. I did everything myself as the specialist company that quoted me charged me about $3000. 

\-international health certificate (dated maximum 10 days before date of travel) signed by USDA certified vet and endorsed by USDA APHIS.

\-up to date rabies certification

\-appropriate travel bag/kennel

\-payment to be on flight

\-documents for the airline for pet travel & pet travel checklist (things your dog needs to have while in the airport and airplane)

I used [https://www.bringfido.com/travel/](https://www.bringfido.com/travel/) a lot in order to get a bit more insight into airline travel.

If your dog is small, while on public transport, keep them in their kennel or travel bag as much as possible if they are not used to being on it. I think they'll likely feel more comfortable and secure in their own space. Passengers will agree with you. 

Can you have your luggage sent ahead to your final address? Some train companies offer this service in France, so it might be something to look into if you can limit the amount of luggage you have with you (if your dog flies with you)"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fcxepy5,t3_ejdslh,1578060976.0,Mad for what? The only jokes I've seen are how we're not involved and don't want to get involved and had no parts in making this decision nor in electing Trump and his cronies that made this happen.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fcuto6x,t1_fcudks9,1577988277.0,"You know what, when I last checked they were all plus 100€. I think I will get one. Add it to the 2020 goals."

dogs,fcuaor8,t1_fcu94la,1577976565.0,"I've had vets say to feed grain-free because they believed the grains to be the cause of a skin allergy in one of my dogs. Honestly, his skin condition improved after making the switch and he did not pass because of heart disease. So I'm going to need more definitive proof, no speculation which is what this is without further study on a variety of breeds."
dogs,fctrlc3,t3_eintbp,1577955863.0,"Honestly, I'm wary of any studies that claim grain-free is the problem. Point to the ingredient that is causing the issue as I doubt wheat is it. Dogs weren't munching on wheat beforehand and grain-free has been used in the last decade.

The problem that these big food companies are having is a major change in their production as consumers are moving to more tailored and attractive pet food companies. They have decided to put the effort in marketing and ingredients that people didn't care for in the past."
dogs,fc4jz8q,t3_eg51bs,1577418882.0,"What do you need help with? It sounds like your dog is happy. If you want him to calm down, you'll need to start by restraining your behavior, then restraining him. But you should be happy that he loves your friend. He could full on bite her out of fear or protectiveness, but he seems to be handling things well, just wants to play."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fc3o4u7,t3_efwe1j,1577394401.0,"To be honest, I have not known my apple earphones to give me superior audio quality a day in my life. I have Skullcandy bluetooth earphones and have 8 times out of 10, chosen the plug-in earphones I received on a AirFrance flight. I hate these cordless earphones. Always falling out of my ears and getting lost. Haven't found a pair worth the price. And seeing how many Airpods get lost and people asking around if I have seen one or both...they aren't worth it either."
Instagramreality,fc1z7pv,t3_efo1zv,1577334399.0,"You know what, I believe she's not wearing makeup besides lip gloss. She has the money and time to live in spas and dermatologist offices to keep her skin clean, hire professional trainers and nutritionists to keep her eating right and working out. It's just too bad that all of that is combined with a ton of cosmetic surgery.

She is definitely using a filter or ""bright light"". For all her skin lightening promos, her skin color is shown as drastically lighter. Then all regular photos show a darker skin color. Whatever image sells, I guess. Figures..."
Instagramreality,fc1ygfz,t1_fc1m8vp,1577333670.0,"I have always had those patches on the sides of my face and one of my best childhood friends had it as well. Needless to say, we didn't own cell phones. It's not a cell phone thing."
