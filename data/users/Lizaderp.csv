It's always awkward meeting a person of color with his last name and knowing ""your great granddad probably owned his great granddad"" or something to that effect.

I just erased about two paragraphs of personal trauma. I'm a victim of stealthing. And trying to get help has just made my trauma worse so... I'm doomed to just be alone my life because I deserved it apparently. If this compromise is what it'll take for me to get help, I'll take it. I can see the other side of the argument. Men saying that ""women trap us."" They opened their legs like I opened mine, but that dishonesty and fraud is the same behind both arguments.

Your sister stored them properly, in her closet, in her space, which your kids shouldn't have been in, and then you tried to cover up the fact the kids put them in their own mouths? That is disgusting and I hope she sues you for the cost.

At age 7, your kid should know better, so take the money out of his college fund cause he clearly won't be getting in.

So go ahead and remember how you feel when they find the dong in your sisters closet. I mean they're kids, right?"
