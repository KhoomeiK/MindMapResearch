Also, just because the box says ""washes out in 14 washes"" doesn't mean your hair goes back to it's original color. It can permanently stain your hair and not fade correctly especially if it's going against a strong color. 

If she washes her hair every 2-3 days, that is at least a month dealing with the hair color. 

I'm glad she stood her ground."

relationship_advice,fdnbs9k,t3_ema2zv,1578582377.0,"Some girls send nudes to guys in relationships. 

I know two people who this has happened to and they both REMINDED the women that they are in a relationship and told them not to do it again. They both also told their significant others as soon as it happened. I know they did because their girlfriends were FURIOUS. 

One of them knew they were flirting. The other was just being polite/friendly and the girl confused it with flirting. Regardless of whether they were opening flirting or not, they both told the girl sending nudes to stop. They both also let their significant other look at their text conversations with the girls to show they were innocent. Both of their girlfriends blew the fuck up and they wanted to reassure them they weren't cheating. 


Your boyfriend did the complete opposite of my friends. 

He didn't tell you when it happened. He saves it. He lied about it. Doesn't let you see the text conversations with that girl. Probably didn't tell her not to do it again since he is parading the photos around and people are asking for more. 

Break up with him."
