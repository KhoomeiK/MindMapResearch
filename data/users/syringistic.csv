mildlyinfuriating,ffjiwro,t1_ffj0o50,1579999244.0,"Yeah but from a business perspective for the primary contractors it actually makes sense. The building owners have a maintenance crew working full-time anyway, and the primary contractor for a renovation can give the building owners a ridiculously low price (Im talking a 3bed/2bath gut reno for 50k in NYC, which is insane). The building owners correctly assume that once they rent, the tenants wont be asking for a ton of fixes, just the basics. So cheaper renovation and the fix-up costs only come into play once they have monthly revenue from the tenant. 

Its fucked up, but it is how it is. I moved away from commercial/rental work because I was tired of either fixing other peoples work or being asked to do a shit job."
mildlyinfuriating,ffjicbo,t1_ffj1ct7,1579998866.0,"Yup that is correct. The other comment  you have also works very well, but isnt as time efficient. The caulk/tape method is hella quick once you get the hang of it."

The understanding of aerodynamics just wasn't catching up fast enough to to technology to dictate airplane design in the 30s and 40s. 

The fear of the sound barrier came out from pilot reports that indicated that around Mach .9 things got REALLY nasty in terms of turbulence and control loss. 

So really they thought that it would be a challenge to build a manned airplane that could go faster."
mildlyinfuriating,ffiy9lm,t1_ffihb5a,1579985676.0,"""The plan lol. In shitty rental buildings, Ive seen entire apartments gut-renovated with only the general room layout being on paper. Everything else was done on the basis of ""least materials, quickest way possible"".

Just imagine this: a small, windowless bathroom with every paintable surface, including ceiling/doors, covered in an almost-black purple color. I have an anxiety problem and it was so claustrophobic that I think I painted it even before unpacking."
mildlyinfuriating,ffixf6d,t1_ffit78g,1579985070.0,"The tape quality doesnt really matter, unless you are taping freshly painted surfaces. 

What gets the job done fastest if you don't happen to have a good brush and a steady hand is: tape off the line, Apply a tiny amount of white caulking at the edge of the tape, smear it with your finger until there is just a really thin layer, wait a few minutes and then paint the line. Remove tape with a smooth motion when the paint is half-dry. That gives you as nice a line as possible."

ABoringDystopia,ffib07y,t1_ffhvhrp,1579969575.0,"A ""deterence"" fee is a good idea. It should also be fairly simple - each municipality can calculate what it costs on average to get to the ER by taxi, and add 50% on top of that. 

Of course good ideas don't fly in the United States. I was charged more than 1000 dollars for a 10 minute ambulance ride and I didnt even have a choice since it was an accident."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffhv5a7,t1_ffhh2cu,1579955368.0,"I havent seen an NYC waterbug in at least 10 years. Its odd, but it really depends on where in the city you live. Waterbugs tend to thrive in the medium sized apartment buildings that have a lot of space inside the walls for infestations."

Iamactuallyverybadass,ff27clv,t1_ff25qfd,1579495902.0,"Ghost Wars by Steve Coll*** is a great indepth look at just how complicated all the fighting in Afghanistan was. Though you are right in that the US mostly supported Northern Alliance, who were very much opposed to the Taliban, there were numerous pre-Taliban mujahideen factions that were also anti-US and very much hardcore Islamic. 

Unfortunately noone wants to do their actual reading so it gets boiled down to ""Reagan met with the Taliban in the White House"" and ""CIA gave Stinger missles to Osama bin Laden""..."
freefolk,fezwhem,t1_feyn0zm,1579462562.0,"I had a similar thought a while ago - even people who have never watched SW still recognize Darth Vader, Millennium Falcon, or a lightsaber. Even (in the case of a lightsaber, lets say) if its your grandma saying ""oh that laser sword thing from that space war movie,"" its indicative of the fact of how much SW has permeated culture."

agedlikemilk,fepnmxp,t1_fepctc3,1579325367.0,"If youre not being sarcastic, a lot it came down to politics and business. NYC needed a memorial, which took up space on that land.
