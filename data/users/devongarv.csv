That's not a good thing to do because a service dog can help but it won't fix the root of your problems.

I trained my own, but even with the help of a professional trainer I still had to dedicate an entire year of my life to training her. No going to school, no working, just concentrating on training."

dogswithjobs,feb88pm,t1_fe8ecxg,1578956300.0,You want to be disabled to the point of not being able to function on your own?

dogswithjobs,feb7if0,t1_feaw1wj,1578956142.0,"This is a service dog, not an emotional support animal. ESAs have no training, they're just regular pets. But to answer your question, most people will start training a new dog 2-3 years before their current service dog retires. That way when it's time for them to retire, they'll have a fully trained dog ready to go."
