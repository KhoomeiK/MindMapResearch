pics,ff6fjh0,t1_ff6c821,1579626095.0,"Primarily the quality of the materials, yes, but when dealing with steel, this can come in many forms.

Usually the weak point in screwdrivers like those shown by OP is the plastic handle.  I spent many years working at a hardware store, and many times cheap tools would have the handle slip off of the tool or shatter.  Many times this could be attributed to people using their screwdriver as a drift pin, center punch, or a chisel.

The steel for the screwdriver is important too.  If the steel is not hardened enough, it bends under tension or the head of the screwdriver becomes malformed.  If it is hardened too much, the metal becomes brittle and can shatter while in use.  Most of the metal issues I have seen with the extremely cheap screwdrivers coming from overseas (china mostly) is that the steel used in powder-cast, meaning that the mold is filled with a steel powder and is then heated to weld the fine steel particles together.  This can create inconsistencies in the metal.  They then plate the metal to make it look shiny.

---

This is tied into one of the other issues, like lack of quality control.  Some tool manufacturers are inconsistent, meaning that some of the tools are great while others are trash, and the lack of quality control (whether intentional or otherwise) allows the trash to go out with the good.  Other times, the inconsistencies arise when the same tool is made in multiple locations, like when some of your tools are made in the US so that you can have the label on the product, but half of them are made overseas."

Back when I was working at a hardware store and selling water heaters, nearly all were designed to fail shortly after their warranty period.  a family needs hot water, and a $200 small unit is not going to do the job.

You are going to have to spend at least $600 on the 50-gallon model that will last you only 7 or 8 years.  If you want it to last longer than that or have a higher water capacity, suddenly you are looking at $1500+ price tag, and most families are not going to have that laying around.
