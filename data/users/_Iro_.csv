1. Revoiced Onmund from Shezarrine - The Fate of Tamriel:  
He has 4000 lines of dialogue and is very close on Lucien/ Inigo levels of dynamic dialogue paths, voice acting, and location/ quest awareness
2. Khajiit Will Follow:  
Adds 4 new Khajiit followers also totaling 4000 lines of dialogue. Fully fleshed out with dungeons, branching dialogue, backstories and personalities that make it good with Inigo for a Khajiit playthrough
3. Kaidan 2:  
1200 lines of dialogue. Picked this one because even though it lacks the amount of dialogue in the first 2 it still allows for a lot of RP options in the paths. There's also an in-depth relationship advancement system which is nice if you're in to that.
4. Teldryn Serious:Repurposes Teldryn Sero from Dragonborn into a much more in-depth follower using dialogue splicing, adding 500 new lines of dialogue, with more added if you download the marriage add-on. The dialogue is spliced so naturally it really feels like part of the game. Definitely one of the best Dunmer followers out there.
5. M'rissi's Tails of Troubles:   
2000 lines of dialogue. I originally thought this mod was fanservice until I played through it and found out it had an actually decent story, made a good attempt to be lore-plausible, and had decent branching dialogue options."
