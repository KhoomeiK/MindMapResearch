AskReddit,ffa9nit,t3_esc8vq,1579730592.0,"I'm primary school i was a perfectionist and graduated with 100% on all exams. Then came secondary school and i did really well, but slowly and surely, i started to slack off. I'm going college next year and all I'm getting right now is Ds and Cs, unlike the As and A*s I used to get. I'd tell him to revise, dont think of girls too much, and to not socialize with [old crush], as it also took a big play in my downfall. I'd tell him to not make friends either, as I know what's best for me. I'd tell him to just stay antisocial, pay attention in lessons and revise, and to do that until college at the minimum. I just dont want another life ruined by my mistakes."
