depression,fekuw4t,t3_epiyby,1579208093.0,My therapist said it’s a form of self-soothing and that it’s natural!
udub,feeaa90,t3_eoo6dr,1579029631.0,i just slipped and came back to this post to comment this.
udub,fe6p2dj,t3_enzi79,1578898867.0,"Yay!! I’ve been a part of a Buy Nothing group in my parent’s neighborhood and they’re awesome! Didn’t realize there was one for UW Campus! Also, the 21 rule isn’t really strict unless you’re getting alcohol products in my experience."
udub,fdvvvob,t3_elblp9,1578752181.0,"Hey there! I feel this a lot too, even as a second year. I think the first couple of weeks are the hardest when you’re getting into the groove, and even harder still when you aren’t getting the accommodations you need. I highly suggest checking out DRS in the Mary Gates Hall basement. It was a lifesaver for me. Wishing you the best for this quarter!"
udub,fdvtnhy,t1_fdm793d,1578751335.0,"Yeah, this is pretty ridiculous, even for UW"
udub,fdozfnq,t1_fdoz5dw,1578616390.0,"Okay, thank you! I will definitely do that"
udub,fdoyt2g,t3_emirii,1578615982.0,Also thinking of adding another class that has a large class size (700)
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdlbw1j,t1_fdjvm94,1578520719.0,"I had a creepy physics teacher who would always call up the pretty girls to do demonstrations for the class. One time, for some reason, we had an unnecessary and really weird demo where he and the other physics teacher basically tied up a girl on a rope hanging from the ceiling (???). I think it had to do with momentum but he kept pushing her on her lower back and thighs, and wouldn’t let her off of it. He flirted with them super often. Made me feel bad for his wife and young child."
HighQualityGifs,fdgc32p,t3_ekyi7v,1578389476.0,Was this about Joaquin Phoenix’s speech? I’m a little OOTL
notliketheothergirls,fd3ap5i,t1_fd2rtcz,1578156432.0,"That was my chemistry lab partner’s name! She was super sweet and funny, loved her name. People mispronounce and misspell my name all the time too even though it feels like it should be very simple."

bujo,fcwx2k8,t1_fctme3t,1578041301.0,"Thank you so much! I will totally look into those! I really need to get better brush pens, the ones I got are so light and barely visible"
PublicFreakout,fcwvceu,t1_fcvln3o,1578039150.0,"You know that security exists at high end boutiques and shops? Hell, even Patagonia has a security guard waiting at the door at all hours."
PublicFreakout,fcwv3oo,t1_fcvdo2e,1578038862.0,"Yeah, I actually felt really bad for her. This is obviously more than just bad attitude, she needs some help."
bujo,fctgel8,t3_eituv4,1577942429.0,"Also, I’m probably going to go and get some better pens/markers for my journal. Didn’t do too much research and went for the cheapest supplies I could find. This is so much fun, loving it!"
depression,fcl9w6g,t1_fckgx5t,1577742975.0,"Me too, I’ve gained like 20-25 pounds in a year"
aww,fcben2z,t1_fcb5se5,1577585927.0,My friend from high school used to call one of the  basketball coaches weird for owning a lizard. Never disclosed to her that I’ve had tree frogs and geckos or that I currently have a horned frog.  BF also had snakes and currently has a dragon and two chameleons but she doesn’t pass judgement on men as much as she does to other women it seems.
confessions,fcb4hlu,t1_fcaehly,1577582236.0,He definitely wants attention seeing how he posted this multiple times for karma.
confessions,fcb3wyv,t1_fcamc7o,1577582023.0,That would make it even more pathetic if it was real. Spinning his sob story for upvotes.
depression,fc8emyv,t1_fc80fii,1577533195.0,Sorry to hear you’re going through similar. I didn’t think I would ever care about what other people would think when it came to taking my life but just thinking about how broken and devastated my boyfriend might be really makes me sad and feel guilty/selfish.
KamikazeByWords,fc7yy13,t1_fc7rdvf,1577522376.0,you can tell by “crazy ex”
relationship_advice,fc3pden,t3_efvych,1577395295.0,"You are such a great dad, and you’re handling this awkward situation so well. I think as long as you have explained your side of the story and propose the resolution of installing a lock, things will be sure to blow over and he will be able to look back at this moment sooner as not only an embarrassing party story to tell, but also a moment where his father really stepped in and provided him love, open arms, understanding, and genuine care. So many parents would be angry to find out their kids are having sex and some of my friends have had their doors removed for it. I think it’s super awesome to see a post like this and I wish you the best of luck. You’re seriously an amazing parent, it brings tears to my eyes."
unpopularopinion,fc3ocve,t1_fc2nqf1,1577394562.0,"I had Beats Bluetooth Earbuds that are similar to the skull candy ones you mentioned, but the problem is that I have long hair and any earbuds that have wires that go behind your neck always get stuck in my hair unless I have it up in a bun or ponytail. I tried out Airpods and now it’s my go-to. It’s very simple, portable, easy to use, and doesn’t interfere with anything unlike wired earbuds. Not super affordable, but I prefer it over others. I also just like the way it sits in my ear rather than being jammed in with those silicone ear bud covers."

AccidentalRacism,fbrboxj,t1_fbqqnm9,1577041402.0,"Yup, came here to say this. The other stickers in the picture are on the bottom right of the book and they usually are at B&N. Some employee there got some smart idea."
ptsd,fbioixm,t3_edkm1t,1576907729.0,"Me too. I have not driven in a very long time since my accident and I have frequent nightmares about it. If I have to drive, I have panic attacks and have to get out, which makes it dangerous for me and everyone on the road. It’s better to just not until you’re 100% sure and ready."
