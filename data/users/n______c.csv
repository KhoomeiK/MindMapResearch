DogAdvice,ffhagmf,t3_et72pl,1579927884.0,"I’ve read here a few times before that when one partner is being favoured or listened to over the other, there’s a technique where the person being ignored becomes the sole source of all good things for the dog for as long as it takes for the dog to respect them.

Obviously your schedule may make this easy or difficult! But basically, for a period, only you give the dog the things they want, and always as a reward after obeying simple and then gradually more advanced commands. Only you present their meals. Only you have their favorite high value treats. Only you give them pats and eye contact and fun walks. Your partner has to basically ignore them, so they learn to look to you for everything. 

Definitely easiest with food motivated dogs! I haven’t tried this myself but have seen lots of positive comments."

Dogtraining,fek4x15,t3_epjal6,1579192682.0,"My doodle is the noisiest water-lapper in the history of animals. And water. She loves a huge drink at approx 4am, water bowl comes to the bedroom but the sheer noise of her drinking wakes us up (and possibly people in other parts of the Tri-State area). Then she lets out a huge old man sigh, like she’s just been told her taxes are going up again, and goes back to sleeping upside down with her legs in the air and belly and privates and exposed as possible. 

Drives me fucking nuts. She’s great."

DogAdvice,fek1k08,t3_epksr9,1579190631.0,"I can’t help with the eye situation, I’d be at the vet. But with the diarrhoea, that’s a pretty expected reaction when you suddenly change a doggo’s diet. Vets will recommend phasing in a new food, so you mix in a little of it for a couple of days, then and 50/50, then mostly new food with some old food, before finally getting to 100% new food. We’ve had to do this, it’s not super helpful if you’ve run out of food, but still good to know! Just in case you read something online one day and become convinced that, say, your dog shouldn’t have chicken. You’ll still want to avoid just switching to a new food all of a sudden to avoid the poops."

my uncle back home had a “retired” German Shepherd police dog. our friends in Brooklyn have one now, and she’s so so sweet, but they had a couple of crazy years learning exactly how much exercise and how many “jobs” she needed! inc. multiple surgeries to remove tennis balls and socks she’d eaten. they work from home so the pup had loads of company and walks, but it was more the mental stimulation they need (why they’re great police dogs back home, for example). they’re very trainable and amazing dogs, but they’re also a working breed who need a lot from their owner - so be prepared for that, and be sure you can provide it!"
