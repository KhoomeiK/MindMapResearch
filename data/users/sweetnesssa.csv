pettyrevenge,ff99pqw,t1_ff95jio,1579708060.0,"Dog grooming is one of those home based business that can be quite profitable if you've got the knack for it. The person we take our dog too has their garage converted to a dog grooming station. The only major expense in this was installing a two tiered washing station (one for big dogs one for small). They are booked a year in advance and charge 40-100$ per visit based on the size of your animal and if you're just getting a basic wash and trim or other services. She takes up to six clients a day so let's say she averages 50$ a visit she's making 300$ a day. So you're looking at 1500$ a week for a five day work week. Definitely not bad. 

People are very particular about who they leave their animals with too, so if you're good with animals and do a good job it's easy to cultivate a loyal customer base and most people will book a couple sessions in advance, so you've got a predictable income which is great for a small business.

It's based on a true story and was adapted for a move about a decade ago ""The Way Back"" and it's quite the ride, both emotionally and action wise, and I found it to be quite quick paced. It's about a group of prisoners in a Russian work camp in Siberia who escape and walk thousands of miles, avoiding capture, to Tibet. 

There has been some question that parts of it are more fiction than real, but if even a small portion of the treatment he experienced in captivity is true I can't blame the writer for creating such a fiction instead of remembering the reality of his imprisonment.

worldnews,ff41oc2,t1_ff2ltrj,1579553606.0,"Part of the reason why things are so shitty in 3rd world counties is because 1st works countries use them as resource cows and dumping grounds. Capitalism depends on the exploitation of natural and human resources, and since they have a lot more legal restraints on exploiting workers and resources within, capitalist counties rely on the lesser protections of the third world to exploit to their hearts content.

Basically I'm saying that the third world is mostly full of poverty because it's natural resources and human resources are being used to further the interests of the first world, instead of being used to uplift its actual citizens. The wealthy in the third world are wealthy cause they are selling you all out. The wealthy in the first world are wealthy because their families have been carefully maintaining this arrangement of power for centuries.

Meanwhile the rest of us get screwed, in both worlds, and maybe the minimum wage workers of the first world who are getting screwed are in a better place than the people in the third world who are getting screwed, but it's like the difference between anal with and without lube; things might go more smoothly with the former but were still all getting fucked."

crochet,feon5b1,t1_feohulb,1579302521.0,"Not OP, but you have to shrink treat it, this removes any weak points and allows you to control the thickness. First you cut up the bags so they are all flattened out into long sections, then you place two or more of these sheets together and sandwich them between two large sections of parchment paper (like you use for baking), then using the low setting on your iron run the iron over them until they shrink down. You might be surprised at how much they shrink. It should only take a few seconds. Repeat with all your plastic bag sections. Take care the surface of your iron never touches actual plastic. 

Once all the separate sections have been shrunk, use sewing pins to pin several of the sections into one long section like you would if they were fabric that you were pinning together. Then sandwich the area joined by the sewing pins with the parchment paper again, and run the iron over these areas to melt and join the separate sections together, remove the pins and gently pull at the joining to test for the strength and any gaps, and use the iron as necessary to secure the bond completely.

Now that you have one long piece you can start cutting it into your plarn, or you can keep joining long sections, and then join those long sections together to create a larger square. 

To cut it up you do that trick where you cut almost to the edge, but leave an inch, and then cut a line from that edge to the other end and leave an inch again, so that you essentially cut one long continuous piece of plarn from a single sheet. I'll see if I can find a image to link to that describes this part.

Finally, make sure you do all of this in a well ventilated area cause melting plastic will release fumes. If you're doing this a lot like say you're making these bags to sell I'd suggest getting a respirator for this, as it will start giving you headaches. If it's just for the occasional personal project just make sure you crack a couple of windows. I had to produce a bunch of this stuff for a big art project and my roommate had to leave the apartment. Thankfully she was understanding and in the future I waited until I knew she'd be out of the house for a few hours.

There are other methods too I'm sure but this is what I have done to upcycle plastic. I've used this to make plarn as well as construct clothing for wearable art projects.

aww,feojwiq,t1_feo6ahy,1579301181.0,"I think if they would exist or not if not for human animal husbandry is beside the point; the issue arising now is as a species we are starting to wake up to how much our actions can cause harm in light of our growing awareness of the consciousness of other beings. It took us millennia to get to a point where the majority of us agree that treating other human beings  as less than human because of things like race or sex is wrong. Now our science is showing, undeniably, that most animals are also conscious and capable of suffering and pain. How we are reacting to that realization is shaping what we become.

We might have to give up eating living meat if we want to keep calling ourselves human beings instead of animals."

In a situation where you have an animal like this that has maybe been in close quarters for its whole life it's usually better to allow it to adjust gradually to its new freedom and its new companions or it might hurt itself or others. There might also need for it to be quarantined from the other animals initially."
news,feo9lam,t1_fendr3b,1579297002.0,"No, it's not important, but if you've ever had to wear formal dress it's sometimes not particularly comfortable, and the last thing you want to do is be fighting with your underwear on top of that, having the right undergarment can make the entire experience easier so you can actually focus on what's going on instead of trying to find a moment where you can sneak away to adjust your boobs or pick out a wedgie. 

Also, if you're a woman who has a full bust finding the right bra can be an ordeal, just look at a sub like r/abrathatfits to see how many struggle just find a garment that fits right. If someone was to steal my bras out of my luggage I'd be furious. I've had them stolen from shared laundry rooms before and it sucks having to replace them. So maybe it's not important in the big picture of things but what's the point of even pointing that out or arguing about it, your negative energy is just as bad as people wasting energy caring about minor things like underwear from my perspective."

oilpainting,feniwlt,t1_fen4was,1579285664.0,"They are both forgiving in their own ways, but oil paint is more workable since it stays wet, meanwhile if you mess up with acrylic you can fix it...by repainting the whole area you messed up.

My main reason for preferring acrylic is that it's more forgiving to people who don't have a dedicated studio space since it dries quickly and clean up is easy. Oil paintings take weeks to dry and chemicals to clean up after. Some people also have issues with the paint fumes, so something else to think about if you paint in a poorly ventilated space."
