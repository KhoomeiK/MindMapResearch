Since then Fox News has probably been called out on every single piece of social media, in every single way. This won't stop mentally ill, doped up, old people from watching it, and it won't stop the channel. We need journalism laws in this nation, that's what the fuck will stop Fox.

Bill Clinton was essentially a republican during his presidency in today's standards. Besides Nafta and the Brady Bill, he was strongly anti-immigration, ramped up police spending, and literally invented some of the powers Bush used in his war on terrorism. 

If we just keep republicans out of office you will see the overton window go left, guaranteed. Neoliberals like me will wonk out the policy numbers, while progressive keep pushing us further left into actually awesome socialist ideas we can finally spend our money on.  Idk, I'm not a very good neoliberal now a days I guess, but what use is money made from capitalism, if we're not going to a) put some regulations on it to make sure we aren't harming our own population and b) spend it back on our people to have awesome shit. 

Instead we just spend it on the military. While I understand deterrence and the important of our military (our hard power buys our soft power) we outspend everyone by so much its ridiculous. AND WHERE does the money go? Not to soldiers, not to actual things we use to wage war, but to a pissing contest between branches for a new cruiser or something that is so utterly ruined by the time it comes out we can't even use it.

If I feel this way, I have to believe some other fellow liberals have really changed their thinking over the years too. We can't be Keynes, we can't just spend on anything. We gotta be Hayek, we have to choose what we spend that money on. If people could just see us spending money on other things and it working, I think the Overton window will swing left."

Honestly, I like Bill, he was my childhood president, but the Monica thing is harder for me to get over because of the age and power differential. After going to law school, it kinda changed my mind, that's classic power differential, with a much younger woman. Disgusts me. So it's hard to reconcile that. A guy using his power to get bjs from younger women should be likeable? Asking that question to reddit is prob moot since most of ya'll dont even see women as people, but hopefully there are same minds with common sense. 

Graham was technically on the right side of this legal argument, since today many states agree with him about sexual favors between boss and employees, but for the wrong reasons. It was partisan and about the bk. Not the abuse of authority/power which Ms. Lewinksy was a victim of (she herself even states as such and to paint it differently than that is just the same male bs men do so they can keep sick men in power). But we werent that woke tbh, abuse of power/authority rape is very recent and rhats why most people dont think it exists.
