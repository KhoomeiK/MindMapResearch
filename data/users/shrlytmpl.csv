Everywhere I go, I make sure to ask them not to give me single use plastics like bags or straws. On many occasions they look at me as if I'm talking some alien language and ask me ""but why?"", and some places just keep trying to give it to me as I'm asking them not to. Too many people are completely unaware about what's going on, and that's exactly how companies want it. It's bullshit to say ""people want single use plastics"". The honest answer would be ""it's cheaper for our company and people don't know any better""."

It's like trying to make a Superman movie where he didn't have powers to make him more believable and real. Joker's ""superpower"" is that there's no rhyme or reason to why he's the way he is. He's a mystery, so nobody knows what hell do next or how to stop it (till Batman does, obviously)."

We're incredibly far from colonizing other planets, and if you want to find ways to ""reverse"" climate change (lol), we probably shouldn't be making it harder for ourselves by continuing to pollute.

But, yes, obviously switching to clean energy is the first step. I don't understand how you think that that hasn't been at the forefront for climate activists. Just because it isn't nuclear? Nuclear plants take a long time to get running, and we have sources we're putting into action NOW, if only every government would get behind them."

But the gasses and chemicals and waste we put out there changes constantly that it'll take longer for nature to know what to do with it. And the old ""in millions of years earth will be fine, so why should we care"" argument is just plain stupid.

So if I was unhappy he'd kick me out and say that I was doing something illegal. Fortunately he said this right in front of my security camera, so when I pointed it out he just ran off. They've been know to set buildings on fire when tenants didn't want to move (pretty sure that's what happened with my last place). We really shouldn't be letting them police themselves."
