Cows give WAY more meat then deer so you're actually getting many more meals per animal if you eat a cow."

aww,fddm6ff,t1_fddggig,1578317480.0,"Seriously, and in this particular instance I'm very sure that sugar glider was trying to attack that cat. On the ground, nowhere to go and a large predator is coming right at you? This sugar glider is a sitting duck and it's not going down without a fight. See how it went for the face and attempted many bites? I've had four for years and they are not as docile as those adorable faces make them seem."
delusionalartists,fcvagdm,t1_fcukvzi,1577998010.0,"No it doesn't, not regularly. This artist is is like the Banksy of furry porn. The comments on the original post are absolutely FILLED with salty people who can't afford it and are insulted by the price but everything they post sells within about a day, (See how it says ""Closed""?) That's not delusional either, that's just being a successful businessperson. Also the end result is professional quality.


Now would I pay 7.5k for this? Hell fucking no, but there's a ton of other luxury stuff I wouldn't pay 7.5k for either."
