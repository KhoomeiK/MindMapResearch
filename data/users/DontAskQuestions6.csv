bipolar,ff72w60,t1_ff6xmzg,1579640035.0,"Bipolar disorder cannot be treated with mindfulness. Medication is the only way to prevent episodes. Episodes cannot be managed with mindfulness either. Your brain doesn't function correctly and you can't will yourself out of it, only medication can treat it."
CatAdvice,ff4q9z2,t3_erkie3,1579569852.0,"You can replace the damaged strings or slats on blinds without having to replace the whole thing, I found out because my cat destroys the blinds too."
datingoverthirty,fenfq2p,t1_fencsjm,1579283710.0,"That's true, it's still a lie. I don't think age is as big of a lie as kids and marital status, but you think it is, so we have different opinions."
datingoverthirty,fenfeyo,t1_feneyom,1579283523.0,"No, the question was what to do after discovering someone lied about their age on an app. That's what happened. I'm not saying he should lie, I'm saying she should give him a chance."
datingoverthirty,fenf81e,t1_fendktd,1579283404.0,"I understand that i have an unpopular opinion but if OP didn't want to consider both sides, she wouldn't have asked the question. You're trying to correct me because you think your opinion is a fact but it is an opinion."
datingoverthirty,fenevzf,t1_fendktd,1579283198.0,"If you're just going to keep arguing until i agree with your opinion then give it up because i still don't agree. I don't think all lies are the same, and i don't think age on an app is indicative that someone will lie about other things in the future."
datingoverthirty,feneom3,t1_fendktd,1579283073.0,"The ""good way"" is that now you know he thinks there are small lies and big lies, and you think all lies have equal magnitude. Different opinions, different personalities."
datingoverthirty,fenbdi4,t1_fena3wb,1579281054.0,Assuming you found out they lied. Not because you're psychic.
datingoverthirty,fenb6hk,t1_fena3wb,1579280934.0,I'm answering OP's question with my personal opinion and you just keep telling me my opinion is wrong.
datingoverthirty,fenaxm5,t1_fena3wb,1579280780.0,OP said she found out about it before meeting him and asked if she should still meet him.
datingoverthirty,fenatnc,t1_fena7ic,1579280711.0,"No, considering that a deal breaker means you're not compatible with him."
datingoverthirty,fenaogz,t1_fena4ks,1579280620.0,"This reminds me of that Seinfeld episode where Elaine says ""It's a BIG coincidence!"" and the other lady says ""There are no big coincidences or small coincidences, only coincidences!"" So I think there are big lies and small lies and you think there are only lies. It's just a difference of opinion."
datingoverthirty,fena4ks,t1_fen9uw4,1579280278.0,Then it's actually a good way to see that your personalities are different and you wouldn't be compatible anyway. Some people are black & white and some people are gray area.
datingoverthirty,fen9xd1,t1_fen9paq,1579280155.0,"Yeah, I think she should at least meet the guy."
datingoverthirty,fen9rc1,t1_fen991a,1579280052.0,I just re-read your post and maybe you do have a point if you're a lot younger than 48. I was thinking about the difference being 5 years like in the original post.
datingoverthirty,fen991a,t1_fen7qnx,1579279741.0,"I don't mean the lying, I mean why do you have an age filter to 48?"
datingoverthirty,fen90zs,t1_fen7vxy,1579279606.0,"Then you personally should definitely not date someone who lies about their age. But since different people have different opinions, I think OP should give him a chance."
datingoverthirty,fen8l71,t1_fen5y0p,1579279338.0,It's not their popularity it's their magnitude. Cheating is a bigger deal than lying about your age on an app. Maybe he was going to tell her the truth on their first date. It's like when you want a job and you just want to get the interview so you can show them how good you are. I'm just saying that might be his thinking behind it.
datingoverthirty,fen6q49,t1_feksdeb,1579278184.0,"Why do you think their exact age is more important than their character? What changes when someone who's 47 turns 48? I'm not trying to be an asshole I really am curious as to your reasoning, and I'm the only person on here who thinks it's not a deal-breaker so I'm trying to consider if/why I'm wrong but I'm still not convinced."
datingoverthirty,fen4y2j,t1_femyxka,1579277063.0,"The difference is that 5 years of age in your 40s is still in the same age group so it seems like a white lie that doesn't really affect anything. He just wants to get more matches on the app. It's something that's not uncommon among people who would never cheat or steal. So I don't think those types of lies have a correlation. But that's just my opinion. OP asked for people's opinions on whether it's a dealbreaker and my opinion is that it's not, and she should give the guy a chance because what if he turns out to be great."
datingoverthirty,femv10g,t1_femtnng,1579270351.0,"I want to take back what i just posted. I just realized that women lying to men about their age and men lying to women are probably perceived completely differently, and since I'm a woman dating men, it's really not the same thing as what happened to you."
datingoverthirty,femtnng,t1_feli6y1,1579269281.0,"I don't think lying about your age leads to cheating and stealing. I say I'm 35 on dating apps but I'm actually 40, because i think I'll get more responses, and when i meet a guy who actually likes me i can tell him the truth and he won't care because he already likes me, which has happened with previous boyfriends. They both actually said they didn't even remember what age i had on my profile."
nostalgia,felbiik,t1_fel8lpo,1579218302.0,"Same, i watched it as a kid but watching it now i understand a lot of the jokes better."
datingoverthirty,felasr5,t3_epojr6,1579217830.0,I don't think that's a big deal. He thought he would get more responses if he was younger.
AskRedditAfterDark,fel9ofb,t1_fek5tip,1579217111.0,"The Mirena is also good because the hormones in it are only localized to your uterus and don't go through your whole body like the pill. That's what I was told anyway. I think it's 100,000 times more tolerable than the pill."
Makeup,fei082u,t1_fehzaf4,1579127463.0,Very good point!
Makeup,feguzqm,t1_feg4woy,1579103136.0,"That's how i did my lips in high school and i thought it looked sooooo hot. Well, it did in 1998 so it will always have a place in my heart! Though i don't do it now.."

bipolar,fdiy6qx,t1_fdigszt,1578453743.0,"Oh also, that GoodRX app really does have amazing coupons for prescriptions. Lithium is only $9 for a 90-day supply at Walmart. And I've gotten like $100 off on some other things. I don't have insurance i just pay cash so it's a lifesaver and i want to tell people about it if they don't have it yet! And no i don't work for them i just love the coupons."

sugarlifestyleforum,fd45mw7,t1_fd2n3e4,1578164603.0,"Men get scammed, then they bitch about ""girls who try to scam guys"" when it was most likely a man you were talking to the whole time pretending to be a girl."
sugarlifestyleforum,fd43rv2,t1_fd395ga,1578164139.0,"Give me a break with the entitlement crap. You probably think you're entitled to pay the lowest amount possible to get the most possible. For you that's good economics, but for us it's entitlement?  When guys ask for a ""free sample"" and then throw a temper tantrum when i say no, why do they think they're entitled to get something for nothing?"
sugarlifestyleforum,fd41xbh,t3_ejwtay,1578163594.0,"But if a SD gets scammed, you're all saying ""How dare someone try to scam me!! They tricked me! They're terrible!"" but if a SB gets scammed you're saying "" How could she fall for that, she must be so dumb"""

povertyfinance,fck6urq,t3_ehmnti,1577718239.0,They won't cancel your insurance policy until your payment is a month late. They'll probably even change your payment date if you call and ask and then it won't even be late.

bipolar,fc6jm5v,t1_fc61z59,1577482143.0,"Yes, antidepressants make bipolar worse. It doesn't have the same effect as it does for someone who is unipolar depressed. He has to take a mood stabilizer."
