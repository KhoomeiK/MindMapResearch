As a guy, I normally do shake hands when introducing myself/meeting someone new, but I definitely had an interaction just yesterday where myself and 2 girls introduced ourselves. I shook hands with the first one and the second one clearly didn't want to. All of that's fine, it just felt a little awkward. It's not like she owes me her hand when introducing, lol. I just always thought it was a standard thing to do."

Additionally, I put the code to my front door on the 2nd address line, which was recommended to me by a delivery driver before (UPS or USPS, I forget). So the fact that I have it listed in delivery instructions along with on my address line, I'd hope this wouldn't happen again. A package being left outside/stolen hasn't happened since I started also adding it to my address. I live on a main street in a city, so if it's left outside, it's going to be gone within a minute easy.

For reference, I've had around 70 orders since moving into my apartment, and 2 packages were stolen in the beginning. Luckily 1 of my packages was taken in by the shop below, which was a $120 or so microwave, so it could've been 3. All of this has been in a 6 month time span."

At the same time, they guy I talked to hardly speaks English and just might not have been around when the package was delivered. As a side note, I have received a separate delivery today from amazon.

My plan is to ask down below again tomorrow, but if they really don't have it, what should I do? This is a $150 product, and I HAVE had a couple of packages stolen before because the idiot left it outside when I provided my door code (twice). Luckily that just included small things like a shower curtain and t-shirt, so I chalked those up to a loss."

Hell, most of you probably don't even realize that the MAJORITY of NATO members with a military have been actively in the Middle East conflict. The US just has the military power that dwarfs the rest and overshadows them.
