It is bad though that GOG do not have an efficient way to upload the patches (even if there then follows a time lag while GOG approve it). 

Having to manually request royalties is also quite bad, but no idea if that is normal for this type 9f industry."

You can get integration for most platforms now (some are by fans and not GOG) including Blizzard, Epic, Uplay, Steam, Rockstar, Twitch, Origin. It will then update automatically with your purchases.
Can also add certain emulators, adding roms as games.
Can even filter on what is installed, so you can see if your epic games are installed for example.

Adding a new HDD on the other hand is easy assuming there is a spare SATA port on the motherboard.
