Just wet enough. Too dry doesnt burn too wet boils causes runs. 

Different shapes require different points of contact. Diffuse like this needs flat jumper cable backs. Sharper lightning needs nails. Shapes are cut then wet only there to cause a semblance of control.

The lightning does what it wants. The wood does what it wants. I try to wrangle them in place to make art. It's a beautifully elegant synergy of nature and skill."
