offmychest,ffhhy30,t1_ffhhri5,1579936039.0,"Absolutely. I wish you nothing but peace and happiness. You deserve it. Life can be hard and painful as fuck sometimes, but the night is always  the darkest before the dawn. Get some rest and do something you enjoy when you wake up. Hang out with some friends to get your mind off it. If you ever need someone to vent to, if it gets unbearable, you can always message me. I hope you have nice dreams and restful sleep. :)"

offmychest,ffhgy9h,t3_etn6sp,1579934783.0,"Just breathe girl. Everything is going to be okay, no matter how painful it is right now. Believe it or not, i went through the same thing with a long distance relationship. I cried every night and my heart ached beyond words. Its the distance thats making the attraction so much more strong and painful. You need to find a distraction for awhile. I know it will be hard, but do not let this run you into a miserable hole. Theres nothing you can do at the moment, so try to stay positive and not dwell on the pain. I'm so sorry you're going through this, i know exactly how it feels and my heart aches for you. But i promise you the pain isnt forever and you will heal."
