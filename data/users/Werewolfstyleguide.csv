makeupartists,fgiu1lo,t3_eyolat,1580830907.0,I love this! I've been trying to do some specifically clown focused art makeup or photos and this is SO inspiring. The colors are so bold and the lines are so clean.

stopdrinking,ff5r507,t3_ertepl,1579606961.0,"I don't want to downplay the seriousness of how you're feeling right now, but set backs and relapses happen. I did the few months on the wagon huge fall off the wagon for years before this last run. It's not easy, but beating yourself up won't make it easier either. I know it can feel so disappointing and frustrating, but you can do this. Take this as a lesson, be gentle with yourself and kind to yourself."
