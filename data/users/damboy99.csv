deadbydaylight,feob09b,t1_feo9ydh,1579297603.0,"> “checking gen locations” and looting chests is doing nothing

That couldn't be more wrong.

Looting chests finds you tool boxes, and medkits which save time in game, maps which are meh, Flash lights which are great, and Keys which are literally a free win.

Being at a generator before holding M1 for 80 seconds lets you get an idea for what to do when the killer arrives, what loop to run to, and how to run said loop.

New survivors need a time where they can learn loops and get an idea of what to do, because a lot of what new survivors do is be clueless, and run randomly. They don't know how to loop, so give them time to look at a Jungle Gym and think about how to run it.

Knowing the location of the generators on the map allows survivors to better avoid forcing themselves into a three gen that is impossible to get into and not being able to escape. I have had countless games as both killer and survivor where I have 3 gens that are all with in a 7 second walk of each other and its impossible for the survivors to complete one of them. Knowing the location of gens before then can let the survivors prevent this."

However, if we remove killers and survivors who are alone we have 16 survivors (Claud, Bill, Ash, then Nancy or Steve) and 16 killers (Bubba and Ghost face) so it could work."
deadbydaylight,feo6p6l,t1_femr3he,1579295875.0,">  Why are we all still talking about this?

Because tearing off the only thing keeping multiple killers viable is going to bring the game to shambles with out immediate proposed solutions. Knowing BHVR they likely don't have a fucking clue about what they are going to do after this. This is one of the major things that killed Deathgarden.

Personally I don't think they should change gen speeds. I think the are honestly fine. Any survivor player you talk to, hates the fuck out of M1 simulator. Doing Generators is the most boring part of the game and nobody wants more of it. Its the fact that most maps are fucking massive, and there is rarely Survivor/Killer interaction for the first minute or two.

Its the first minute or so of the game that is aids for any killer but Billy Nurse and Spirit who can cross the map in a few seconds. Personally I think they need to add like two minutes at the start of the game, All gens are locked, and Totems haven't spawn. This time ends early the second someone is downed.

Now this allows killers like Hag, or Trapper to set up, and killers who end chases quickly like Billy Nurse and Bubba can do so but still cross big ass maps and not be punished if they randomly choose a far generator and its the wrong one. Maybe during this time allow Killers to see the aura of potential Totem locations and allow them to chose where their hex will be lit, might be too broken though.

But that just adds 120 seconds of survivors waiting to do something, meanwhile they can loot chests, Look at a generators location and plan where to run should the killer arrive at that generator (and the difference between being a good survivor or a bad one is having a plan for when the killer arrives), or do something that nobody but Baby Dwights and Blendettes do and hide. That feeling of 'Please don't see me, Please don't see me' is fantastic, this can encourage survivors to do that, or if you are feeling confident in your looping abilities, you can just run to find the killer and allow your team to do this instead. That's not really a whole lot though so they could add the ability for survivors to 'mark' generators during pre game revealing the generators aura to their team, allowing players to have a general idea of where their allies are, and what generators would be worked on once the game starts. Let survivors mark one of them as one they will go to once the game starts, and that one will stay highlighted until they work on it, another gen is completed or 60 seconds pass, which ever comes first.

Now both teams have something to do and the game cant be decided in the first 30 seconds when the 110 Killer goes to the wrong generator and loses the game when two generators pop before they found anyone.

Or instead of doing any of that which adds more substance to the game they could just make the maps smaller.

I am not a balancing God so the numbers in their might be rough but its better than forcing Killers to use Ruin so that in the chance they are sent to Ordmond, Blackwater Swamp, or Red Forest, they have a fucking chance at playing the game, and then taking it away so that Killers who can't cross the map quickly suffer."

deadbydaylight,felbx2h,t1_fejknzh,1579218568.0,"I mean I don't know that two of my allies are on the other side of the map on the same gen with Prove thyself like me and Meg are and we pop two gens in the first 40 seconds of the game.

I still feel bad, when we pop every gen super quick because I have been in games like that as Killer where you just kind of lose because you spawn in the middle of the map and the survivors spawn in pairs in opposite corners and you chose the wrong corner to go to first. Shit like that is why Ruin is needed in the current state of the game."
deadbydaylight,felbetw,t1_fel62k3,1579218234.0,"That and the ""and I am a Killer Main"" survivors who try to justify the change was needed.

The best way to look at this subreddit is that nobody plays the game at all, and we are all spectators."
deadbydaylight,felazol,t1_felarq9,1579217954.0,"Absolutely, but the amount of red rank players that don't know this is astonishing, and if you have a noggin, are not on a map with a white floor, and are out of sight, you don't have to worry about that."
deadbydaylight,felaru4,t1_fejevke,1579217813.0,"Pop and Surge gives a  33% regression any generator with in 32 meters.

Nah. That is more op than Machine Gun Huntress."
deadbydaylight,felaldf,t1_fejz5n2,1579217696.0,"I just think that more things need to count as basic attacks. You should be rewarded for using your power.

Pig and Demo charge should count imo. Its not an one shot.

I don't think ranged attacks like Hatchets and Corrupt Purge should count, because getting blind sided by a cross map hatchet and getting sloppy butcher is kinda bs. The addons for huntress already do this and have a timer attached to make them less annoying for survivors."
