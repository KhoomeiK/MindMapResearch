socialanxiety,fekbvme,t3_epe4bz,1579196807.0,"If you think that this might be a problem in the future (if you work with them or if you just see them often or even if it just weighs heavily on you) then you can just be honest with them. Like at the end of the day it’s not the biggest deal in the world so you could even bring it up jokingly so it doesn’t seem like you’re making a mountain of a molehill. 

I have the same problem where I’ll often assume that nobody is talking to me since nobody ever does, but I can just wait a couple minutes and say “oh u meant me?” And laugh it off

Still nerve racking, but that’s my strategy"
watamote,fehzayz,t3_ep8mu3,1579126909.0,"I always find it unnecessarily funny that Tomoko’s nickname is mokochi (idk if I’m spelling this right) because moco is the Spanish slang for snot, I feel like that’s really fitting considering how “gross” Tomoko can be sometimes lol"

socialanxiety,fego032,t3_ep0pe3,1579098392.0,"I always dress up for school now that I'm in college and it's always sad seeing people's willingness to talk to me fade away when they realize that I'm actually pretty awkward.

Like they assume that the awkward people are the ones who don't know how to clean themselves up but the truth is I'm always trying to make up for what I lack in social skills by cleaning up my appearance."

socialanxiety,fe91fm3,t3_eo02t0,1578933174.0,Tbh sometimes I’ll just be open about how much of a piece of shit I am and people either grow to understand you and go easier on you or find your self depreciation funny and like you more
socialanxiety,fe90pnw,t3_enoacq,1578932912.0,"I had one of these in 9th grade where this dude and this girl were fighting over gun control laws (the guy was for gun control, the girl wasn’t) and it got really heated to the point where it was just them arguing and everyone else trying to get a word in. 

And then she just yells out “WELL YOU’RE WRONG BECAUSE YOU FUCKING CHEATED ON ME” 

The class got so fucking loud after that lmao"
RebelTaxi,fe2u56l,t3_encoo7,1578842873.0,"That time YMS came on and wouldn’t shut up about Death Note and the time Digibro came on, he was just a really awkward guy to listen to"
USF,fdzppxi,t3_enesui,1578792997.0,I’ve seen a couple websites where you can play online. I tried to teach myself over the summer but I’m too dumb for that game
USF,fdznsgt,t3_en98rd,1578792157.0,I’m kinda hoping this isn’t about me because I know before I left for the break someone had left a plate out and I wasn’t sure where to put it since they all have their own cabinets and stuff lol

stevenuniverse,fdmkbgi,t3_elzpfo,1578553099.0,"It looks like it’s actually from the show, only reason I could tell it wasn’t without looking at the title was because I know she wouldn’t make an expression like that lol"
pokemon,fdiqsmv,t1_fde2uqo,1578448961.0,"Thanks for the help! Do I need to catch the Pokémon with a higher level team member on the field or does it just need to be a higher level team member in my party? Or does my entire party need to be higher leveled?

I’ve been trying to catch a level 46 Sneasel with a level 50 Cinderace and I’ve been having the same problems"
pokemon,fde18if,t3_ekrm4t,1578328887.0,"I keep trying to catch Pokémon in Pokémon Sword but I keep using up all my poke balls trying to catch Pokémon, even when they’re at critical health. 

I was wondering if this had anything to do with how I was playing the game. I stopped trying to get every single Pokémon after the third gym and I started only picking up the ones I thought looked cool or cute. But for some reason I haven’t been able to catch any Pokémon at all since the glimwood tangle. 

I know that I have enough badges to catch Pokémon up to level 45, but I’ve been sitting her for ten minutes throwing poke balls (specifically Ultra balls but also switching over to other types here and there) at a level 40 failinks and I don’t understand why this is happening"
