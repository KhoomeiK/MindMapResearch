&#x200B;

\- A Little Lily Princess - Not fantasy, but based in the classic novel. Great game, with great romance.

\- Starlight Vega - This one has fantasy, another dimension, demons. I absolutely loved the best friend, Melody, route.

\- The Sad Story of Emmeline Burns - Short, sweet and free.

\- Once a Windswept Night - Another one from Ebi-hime, have some fantasy themes. A great and unusual style. It's like having stories inside another stories and playing several times will unlock ways to progress. Good stuff.

\- Rituals in the Dark - I'm playing it right now, and still can't say if has or not fantasy elements. It's pretty nice and intriguing so far.

\- Serment - Contract with a Devil - This one is full fantasy, with the protagonist (you can choose four of them, all females) getting into the demon world, having to pay your debt with the Devil and befriending the locals. Is not a pure vn, has dungeon crawling gameplay. And it's really fun.

\- Fatal Twelve - You died, and get a second chance, a mysterious women bring you and another 11 people to life to play a game, were you must discover the name, regret and cause of death of the others to get the prize, to get your life back."

And I never managed to find a romantic partner. Like in never. It's really hard for me. And when I tied I failed very miserably.  So, dreams of having a family of my own, are impossible.

Speaking of family, I live with my Mother and Sister, since my Father died, and I had to support them and pay the rent. So, I don't even have my own space, my own life.

Also I'm stuck in a job that I hate, because I can't afford being jobless, because that would mean being homeless, and with my Mother and Sister, I can't do that. So, stuck. And fearing being fired everyday. Just because.

And the country, with the economy always bad, but lately in free-fall isn't helping. 

Hate my job. Hate my country. And hate myself.

I'm not gonna elaborate, but I don't like the way I am. In several ways. Some of them impossible to chance. (Except for a Miracle or Sci-plot).
