DDLC,fct70ca,t1_fct2vth,1577934536.0,"I feel you. I do it everyday, but I honestly could care less about my health and how I feel. If it hurts too much and I start affecting others, then he’ll with it. I’ll leave this world as fast as I can. But I’m trying to change other’s lives, make them happier, more proud of themselves, and if that can prevent others from turning up like me, then I’d be happy. So I say, you keep living. Find something worth living for. If nothing is out there, keep searching. It’s tough at first, I almost lost my life searching. But one day, you’ll find what you’re looking for, and all those hard times will slow, and you’d be given a chance to relax"

Right now, I’m living just so I can later say, “it’s been a good life” and die peacefully, and I know I can die peacefully because dying is just like sleeping, you have no thoughts, and you aren’t bothered. Sounds real peaceful. Whatever happens, I hope you do what you are sure of and don’t regret it. I hope it all gets better from here!"
