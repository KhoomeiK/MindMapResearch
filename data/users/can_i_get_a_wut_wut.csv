ainbow,ffjq7jg,t1_ffji2pd,1580004168.0,"They are not synonymous - and looking at the mode doesn’t (and can’t) remove the concept of normality because the two terms refer to measurements from different dimensions in the data - the mode is a point measurement in the normal distribution (sum total) of values.

It’s like taking a vacation through twenty five different countries across the globe but the majority of your photos came from just one city (the mode). So do the photos from that city represent the rest of your trip, the food you ate, and your travel activities? No, there are 24 other unique areas with their own experiences from your trip that represent the rest of the normal distribution, and this one city doesn’t represent every other country you visited in the dataset (or any of the other cities in the same country you may have visited).

So only looking at that single point discounts the entirety of the rest of your dataset and does a poor job of describing the population of points as a whole.

Light editing to make it clear that “24 other experiences” refers to the other countries traveled to"
ainbow,ffizqbk,t1_ffixb8r,1579986740.0,"In stats, there's a theorem called the central limit theorem where large enough data sets will display a normal distribution (aka the classic ""bell curve""). [Here's a pic of one.](http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-03-blogbellcurve.png)

This bell curve counts people. The middle-most part is where the count is highest. This is referred to as a ""mode."" 

So the person in the screenshot is making the point that they are unable to properly define normality since they're ignorant of cases that are not the most common occurrence in the dataset."

What we're talking about is that charging exorbitant amounts for ambulance rides discourages people from seeking medical attention when they need it. And that clearly there's something wrong with our current healthcare system since it's a common scenario for people to feel like they must refuse some kind of medical attention based on financial factors. 

You for example. You're retired... so what happens when you inevitably need healthcare in your old age and your retirement fund disappears? It's going to eat into the amount of money you'll be able to give to your children. You were a paramedic and it's not like you're a multi-millionaire; if you are lucky enough to avoid chronic diseases like cancer then you may be able to avoid bankruptcy from your medical costs. But if you do get a chronic disease your family is going to be financially better off with you dying and letting your kids inherit the money. I hope your kidneys are in good shape!"

ContraPoints,ff84ond,t1_ff7ld46,1579665908.0,"So far it's been okay. I'd describe it as my feelings have calmed down. It's hard to describe exactly what I'm feeling and how my emotions have changed because, of course, everybody is different. And I'm only just approaching week two of being off of hormones right now so I know there will be additional changes in the future.

This is going to sound silly at first blush but I'm about to talk a lot about food and how it relates to my mood. I've found that my anxiety symptoms have resurfaced, but I've also managed to find out what is causing them as well: my mood now seems to be entirely driven by how hungry I am. I had no idea how little my stomach required to function while I was on hormones, but my hunger has come back with a vengeance. I'll find that after eating I am able to be calm during a conversation for about two hours before I start having shortness of breath and a burning chest. The worst part about this is that I usually don't feel that I'm hungry until about hour three. This manifests through a crummy mood, a lot of bitching, and venting my frustrations. When I'm well-fed I feel pretty good, comfortable with myself, able to relax myself around friends and family. But today... I had 5 hardboiled eggs and a protein shake for breakfast at 730am (I'm aware it's a big breakfast and it's become my go-to morning routine) and by 930am I was ready to eat again. But I didn't get food until around 2pm, and as a result I had some very strong anxiety symptoms that I never would have felt if I were on hormones, I was figuratively dying all day.

I find that one of the primary benefits of having gone on hormones is the social and emotional awareness I am now able to draw upon, which has not subsided. My physical expression of happiness and sadness has stuck and it helps me feel those emotions. I'm still able to do things like laugh and cry (which I could never do before hormones) and I find that 1. when I do laugh or cry it's because I allow myself to do those things when I need to, and 2. laughing or crying helps me feel the appropriate emotion. I'm better able to let myself laugh or cry in front of other people because (thanks to publicly transitioning in a retail setting) I have unlearned being embarrassed at my own self-expression.

As for the intensity and nuance of my emotions, I find that I am feeling new emotions with more nuance and subtlety that I had before starting hormones. I would say the intensity of my emotions has dropped slightly, but not into ""I can't feel emotions properly"" territory. Again, this is thanks in large part to the mind-emotion connection that hormones provided me, and as stated before I have to actively practice it now and allow myself to feel. A big thing I got out of the hormones is that I'm able to piece together and vocalize why I feel a certain way and why things bother me, and I find that having a complete physical-mental-emotional processing chain has drastically improved my life and my outlook on life. I am also happy to say it hasn't gone away yet.

I will say that going off hormones there was a period where I felt down that I did not fully feel nor internalize, but was evidenced by the disarray that my apartment was in. I'd say it's a drastic improvement in  The drop in hormones and the post-holiday period were the primary contributing factors to this episode and I only really realized that I felt this way after a clarifying moment when I looked around my room a couple days ago and thought to myself ""it looks like a depressed person lives here."" Since then I've determined that I'm going to take care of at least one cleaning task a day and the mess is slowly going away.

Another big emotional change for me was the addition of an aggression layer on top of big frustrations that I hadn’t felt on estrogen. This is likely due to the resurgence of testosterone. It’s not to the point where I red out or anything, but I have taken notice of it and I’m not having trouble controlling myself when I get frustrated.

Is there anything else in specific you wanted to know about? Feel free to ask. And I’ll add stuff if it comes to mind."

I am MtFtM (and I think maybe genderfluid?) and before estrogen I was so out of touch with my feelings and unable to cry whatsoever. Being on hormones alleviated my lifelong depression and social anxiety and allowed me to have emotional awareness. I learned a lot about myself socially, what kind of friends I enjoy having in my life, and who my true allies are. I learned that my ideal body does not include breasts and that that’s okay! And after all that I’ve found that detransitioning been an overall positive learning experience for me and another step figuring out who I am.

The sad thing about detransitioning, however, is that it’s portrayed as this depressive event and TERFs try to use it as a bogeyman to dissuade trans people from transitioning. And to totally spoil the mood of my wonderful experience with discovering who I am, any garden-variety TERF would see my detransition as a win for them. They would hold me up as evidence that “hey look they can do it and so can you!” This sort of appropriation and weaponization of others’ experiences is what Contra was touching on in her quote. 

My point is, TERFs are going to TERF and haters are going to hate. Deciding to transition now and detransition later does not prove them right. They portray detransitioners as full of regret, but for myself that couldn’t be further from the truth. So if you decide to try transitioning or even just an alternate gender expression and later you decide to go back on your decision - then you are still valid and you are not a burden."

But the hormones have made it so I donâ€™t want to die any more and I feel more like a normal human being than I ever have.

Also, thank you for clarifying your comment. I am of the opinion that since intersex conditions exist (with regard to physical sex), it is totally possible for something similar to happen with the brain and gender perception (eg .non-binary people), and since itâ€™s possible for non-binary people it is therefore possible for mismatches between physical and mental gender (transgender people). Further I would love to see an understanding grounded in science for these phenomena.

Even if weâ€™re not there yet scientifically I most definitely want to get my DNA tested and possibly sequenced because science!!!

Regardless of DNA testing, however, hormones have made me stop autonomously wanting to kill myself. This has happened independently of my gender presentation in public and may not represent all transgender people because errybody difrent ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸"

ShitAmericansSay,fd53s2v,t1_fd3ebtm,1578173933.0,"The reason most Americans lack a worldview is because America is so large and because of capitalism, which prevents the majority of the populace from traveling anywhere. Simply traveling by car between states isnâ€™t even an option for a lot of people, because missing just a couple days of work puts them in danger of not being able to pay for rent, bills, or food that month. So you can imagine that trips abroad are going to be way outside of the price range for a lot of Americans, which leads to a lack of international socialization and blindness about the rest of the world. This factor can also influence racist, homophobic, transphobic, and sexist attitudes by causing a â€œculture drainâ€ through increased isolation of members of the populace.

Additionally school has gotten more and more expensive (thanks again capitalism) resulting in the dumbing-down of a lot of the country. This has resulted in an easier to mislead populace, right-wing (ultra-conservative/authoritarian) governmental figures, and the perpetuation of capitalism. Then throw in some never-ending wars to perpetuate the authoritarianism.

This problem is also visible in Russia, where they have isolation of groups, restricted travel, and authoritarian figureheads in government. The only difference is government control of industry, but even then America is seeing much the same thing through the increased corporatization of industries paired with the corruption in the White House.

I wish the problem was an individual one but itâ€™s systematic at this point."

OpenChristian,fcycpsu,t3_ejix90,1578078129.0,"I think it would be helpful for you to revisit Jesusâ€™ teachings. If you want to believe he is the son of god then a good place to start would be reminding yourself why he is the son of god in the first place. If you ask me, you could throw the whole bible out except for the teachings of Jesus because those are hands-down the most important part, especially loving those who are different from you in some way or who you or others might think donâ€™t deserve love.

I will be honest, I myself do not view god in the judeo-christian sense. I see god as more of an all-powerful collective being who watches over everything, and whose many facets are reflected through us. That means all-powerful as in: all merciful, all-understanding, able to grant any desire, and smart enough to grant those desires according to their ultimate will and plan (this list is not exhaustive).

This approach to developing a view and understanding of god is similar to the approach taken by 12 step programs, who stress that each individual on earth develop their own individual understanding of god. Just because one personâ€™s view of god works for them does not mean it will work for you. 

As an example, the vengeful old-testament god does not work for me; certainly those qualities are not unachievable for god, but if god is truly all-powerful then they have the power to achieve whatever they want through peace (another core theme of Jesusâ€™ teachings btw). So I donâ€™t pay attention to the old-testament god. I trust in the peaceful side of god to show me where I go wrong and lead me by the hand through the tough parts. 

There is a flip side to this: god is all-powerful therefore I am not all powerful. I am fallible and I will err, and this is expected. The key is to accept when you make a mistake, learn from it, and make corrections to prevent it from happening in the future. Further I trust in god to love me even when I mess up in my life.

Regarding Jesus, we will never be 100% sure of the events that transpired, even if we fully trust eyewitness accounts of his life, given that there is fallibility in any retelling of a story (even written). The fact that there are four independent accounts (gospels) with corroborating stories is pretty compelling evidence that Jesus existed, that he gave teachings and was a holy person, and that he was crucified by the Romans. These are the most important details in my opinion - that Jesus is a role model for how we should live and treat others, and that he died here on earth. I believe he died for our sins. 

I also happen to believe he was physically resurrected - but that this detail is irrelevant with regard to onesâ€™ belief in Jesus: that it is not necessary to believe in physical resurrection in order to believe he existed or to live a life like he did. Our lives all must come to an end sometime, after all, and only our loved ones would have anything to gain from physical resurrection. I believe in spiritual resurrection for humanity at the end of our lives, and that we will be brought to account for ourselves.

I know this is a lot to read but I hope it helps you to read about someone elseâ€™s religious beliefs."
