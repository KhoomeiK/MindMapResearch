politics,ffg84ku,t1_ffg0eg7,1579900514.0,"Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon don't exist?  These companies have only existed in recent history and all fundamentally changed the world, which is why they and the people that started them profited."
politics,ffg7yf2,t1_ffg6b4n,1579900408.0,"You missed my point entirely.  Yes, there's production costs, profit margins.  The actual point is it was previous impossible to generate this much wealth, but now its not because of the scale of the global economy.  That scale means your 3 minute transactions do not happen sequentially, there's can be thousands of transactions happening per minute (like Amazon for example), so these tiny profit margins don't matter because your product is selling globally, 24/7/365 at hundreds or thousands per minute."

politics,fffvq3q,t3_et9zis,1579892840.0,"Wrong. If you invent a device, software program, whatever that performs a service a billion people need or want and they each pay you $1, then you just made a billion dollars.  You performed a service and got paid for it, that is a story as old as time.  The thing that has changed in recent history is the internet, relatively cheap global transportation and massive population growth.  Products and services are able to be sold and traded a global scale now, reaching vastly more customers than before.  There is nothing wrong with massively profitable companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, etc. They have changed the world we live in and make things like the platform we are currently on (Reddit) possible.  I have major issues with how they are able to avoid paying taxes and the disproportionate amount of power it gives them.  There should be protections in place to protect workers, but saying that every successful billionaire stole the money is silly and at a certain point progress stops if you are limited to every business in the world being a mom and pop operation.  Maybe that's what people think they want, but I don't agree."
politics,ffdqssd,t1_ffdokt2,1579826693.0,I know what a workers coop is and never said it was a bad thing.  Applying the concept to a 300bn tech company that runs 40% of the worlds cloud computing infrastructure shows a supreme lack of understanding of how what they even do.
politics,ffdqfgx,t1_ffd0sh7,1579826461.0,"Good for them, a coop made up of 260 smaller coops full of unskilled manufacturing laborers.  Now show me even a moderately successful multi-national tech company using this model.  Amazon doesn't just sell stuff at Amazon.com,  at this point half the worlds internet runs on their infrastructure runs on AWS and S3 storage.  I'm not shitting on the concept of a workers coop, I worked for a small computer service company that was a coop, it was great, but we had 40 employees and no illusions that model would work if we were 10x the size."
politics,ffd08i7,t3_eswsqx,1579810864.0,"Pay fair share of taxes, yes. Provides good wages and benefits, even profit sharing, yes. Destroy a business because you think it's too successful, negative. The fact that she thinks a tech company the size of Amazon would even function like this shows she has zero life or work experience in these kinds of companies, or the people yelling it's a good idea for that matter."

I think if the US starts going the way of full nanny state there will be another  revolution in 20 years and we'll be back where we need to be."

pcgaming,ff99igo,t1_ff98m8d,1579707935.0,"Not that it really matters for an rpg, but I don't think so.  PS5 and Series X will absolutely have to make 60fps a standard (still at 1080p) or there's zero reason to buy next gen.  They already said there won't be console exclusives for a like a year or current console sales would come to a dead stop this year.   It annoys me that games always suffer because people expect to play games 5 years later on their shitty launch console.  I'm not buying a series X at all (because all the games will be on PC) and no PS5 until there's exclusives to care about."

More than fighting wars over oil and subsidizing industries that don't need it, but it's just not as easy as 'Look at Finland they can do it!!1'  If it was easy it would already have been done, sadly I fear it will take a collapse or near collapse to get any movement away from the current track."
worldnews,fen5u8y,t1_femunqr,1579277633.0,"Start a business with 5 employees that you manage yourself, then grow that business to 350 employees, split it into 7 person teams each with a different manager, and move each team to a different geographical location.  Now apply the same management style, rules and ideology to that whole company and report your success back to us.

Besides scale (which is enough by itself), the distance between the populations and sheer size and different geography, the culture and history of America that has lead to it basically being 50 different governments constantly fighting with the national government. America will burn and go the way of the Roman empire before it ever adopts a government that looks anything like Finland or any other socialized nanny state."

vegetarian,fekrdzm,t3_epk8vq,1579206034.0,"My history is very similar to yours, vegetarian and occasional vegan going back to the mid 90s.  Nowadays I'm about 90% vegetarian.  I personally give two shits about adhering to the label of vegetarian or vegan 100% of the time.  If I want a piece of bacon occasionally I'll have it.  I choose a mostly plant based diet for my health and to minimize my impact on the environment.  I buy products that at least advertise responsibility and get meat and eggs from a local farm coop.  Every burger you don't eat contributes to less meat being consumed.  I don't think the whole world should be a vegetarian or a vegan and for many people it's nearly impossible for a variety of reasons.  Talk to your friend honestly about your own motivations and that the aggressive lecturing will just make everyone hate her, but if she insists then just start distancing yourself from her negativity."

Still excited, and fine with them polishing their game.  Witcher 3 will forever be in my top 3, so they earned my trust unlike many other studios."
Wolcen,fehyvld,t3_ep8jig,1579126651.0,"I wouldn't expect a small studio selling a $30 game to cater to such niche feature considering the amount of backend work that would need to happen (caching online / offline char data, netcode, etc).  If that's a deal breaker probably best to return it.  I also have kids and game while they are running around the house and while I've never once had this problem I think I'd just park my guy in a corner or worse case die, let him sit at spawn and walk back a minute later?  Seems a shame to miss out on an entire game for something so small, that they may add in later, but my guess is they want to focus on features more of the playerbase will care about."

I'm on the sub because I'm a gamer, but I also play games (and go to the range) with the personal experience of shooting for 25 years, being raised by an infantryman that would not tolerate any kind of fucking around with a gun and being on active duty myself for a few years.
