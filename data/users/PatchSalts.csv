rit,ff318qv,t1_ff3134z,1579530981.0,"Ah, good. I always thought it was a little weird that they taught it so early. Some of these students haven't ever programmed so it could get a little overbearing. I took CS for AP so I actually don't know what exactly they taught before recursion but I have had plenty of people tell me it was pretty wild.

Er, to actually converse on the point, thank you. It was a little unfair to push so much so fast to the students."

sbubby,fen6jbf,t1_felk55c,1579278065.0,"Those franchises' characters (besides the fact that Link has 2 clones, I really don't know what to make of that) are more different than they are alike, in moveset, character design, and personality. For FE, the opposite can be said. Byleth might be different, sure, but FE already felt like it's overstayed its welcome."

CrazyHand,fe5ffds,t3_enspzh,1578868847.0,"As Duck Hunt, I struggle most to get out of disadvantage against Greninja. He typically is really good at getting in my face and stuffing out what I'm trying to do, making all my projectiles unsafe. That wasn't really happening here. For improving on that, get used to knowing which of your moves are safest to hit him with, and maybe practice your spacing? Also, it seems this DH doesn't know how to protect his recovery with the can. Once he uses his recovery, he can't pull anything else until he gets back, so you could probably take advantage of that *on this specific guy*. Others might catch on fast."

smashbros,fdcx74a,t1_fdcsjb3,1578286951.0,"This is by far a much more mature reaction than many many others I've seen. It's not like he's slamming his controller into the ground. Saying others are worse isn't really valid though so I'm just going to put it straight:

This is just as mature as just continuing with the set like normal. We also have no idea what's going on in his head. Perhaps he's taking a good moment to think. Perhaps he is in fact super angry. But I'll say that's props for not putting it into rage."

But in the hand on the lower right, something perspective-wise looks fishy. I think it's that the nails and finger pads make the pinky finger appear to be at an odd angle.

But that's it TBH, even that hand is very well-detailed and well-executed. (Are those even words?) Good job!"
