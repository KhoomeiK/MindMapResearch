Honestly I don’t see much downside to people having them just in case, except for potential shortages for medical workers (but they get separate supplies).  We still have bad flu outbreak in the US anyway so more mask usage isn’t a terrible thing for disease prevention but in general.

Even if there’s no actual medical benefits, it helps make people feel a bit safer. That’s actually really important as the stability of any society hinges on people feeling some relative sense of safety and control. You could argue a false sense of security from an ineffective PPE is dangerous in such a situation, but I think the benefits probably outweigh that danger.

More than likely the pillow was made and packaged long before it even leaves the warehouse anyway, the virus doesn’t even survive on surfaces that long.

When they say the virus CAN live up to 5 days, that’s under ideal conditions on optimal surfaces. And it doesn’t mean it retains its full ability to infect people that long. Fabrics are definitely not ideal surfaces, and the virus could die after a few minutes or hours.

AskReddit,ffgm7eu,t1_fffz7gx,1579909478.0,"My input would be the unspoken taboo aspect of this.... the rapidly shifting family structure along with women entering the workplace. For all the amazing advances we’ve made, throughout pretty much all of human history men and women had predefined “roles”. It hasn’t always been the same roles, but in almost every culture and pre culture those roles existed. And in that, everybody had a set direction and purpose.

“Youre the man...you find a wife, you mate with her, have kids, and work to provide for your family’s needs”.

“You’re the woman...a man will marry you, you will have babies, you will cook his food, you will care for them and take care of the home”

Was everyone happy in these roles? Definitely not. But in some respects there wasn’t the same existential hopelessness about it. Men needed women, women needed men. As long as you were fulfilling your role, you at least had some sense of a preordained purpose.

Today, women are fully capable of supporting themselves, and are encouraged to do so. Flat out, men don’t feel needed anymore. Without those gender roles, purpose is ambiguous.

The solution obviously isn’t returning to archaic gender roles, but figure out how to help men feel needed again."

At the same time tho I get why women avoid it. We’re stuck in a catch 22 now that compliments are so rare, giving one sets off instinctive alarm bells that they must be into you.

politics,feofxpj,t1_felfvcc,1579299595.0,"The 2 party system is exists because there are so many hurdles to getting a 3rd party in power.  From our state voting system, to funding, to the way our government is actually set up.  

The US actually has a lot of political parties. It’s just the vast majority can’t get enough votes to actually get people into Congress, let alone the presidency. Most people view casting a 3rd party vote as essentially throwing it away. There are only 2 “independent” representatives in the house right now. 

I don’t see any ways it’s better than it’s reputation. Politics has become a 2 team sport here. It’s as heated as going to a football game, with no reason for either party to compromise or back down. More often than not our government is at total stalemate. 

It also forces both voters and politicians to “pick a team”.... creating parties with very far apart extremes of views internally.  A moderate/centrist republican and a Christian Evangelical republican likely have vastly different political, social, and economic beliefs. Anywhere else they’d be in different parties. So what happens is we have politicians pandering to everyone in their party, trying to appease people with completely opposite beliefs.

A huge number of moderate voters just end up hating both candidates in major elections, so they stay home rather than voting for “the lesser of 2 evils” as they see it. This gives a lot more control to the voters in those extremes, who typically come out to vote in force.

Here is Part 2 of the article: https://www.thenewspaper.com/news/67/6722.asp

TL;DR -  Money from PPA ticket violations is intended to go back into the city general fund, the transportation system, and school system. Instead, it was siphoned to private individuals and corporations. All fully sanctioned by the city's pro grifters in charge. Furthermore, a lot of the tickets people get from these cameras were bullshit issued from a shoddy system.

These articles talk about how the PPA pays Condulent-Xerox millions of dollars per year to manage the city's red light program.  In 2017, The red light program alone brought in $21 million in revenue...HALF of that went to Xerox. Thats not including what the PPA spends internally on its share of the management. (https://www.inquirer.com/philly/business/transportation/fbi-investigation-philadelphia-parking-authority-red-light-cameras-20171210.html)

The former PPA manager of the program, Andrew Dankanich,  was fired after whistleblowing on corruption he experienced while there. Basically, he accused the PPA scumbag-in-chief, Vincent J. Fenerty Jr, of rigging the bidding system to award the contract to Xerox (a company which had personal ties to PPA executives), even though they were far less qualified than other companies who put in bids.  

The articles go into detail alleging aside from this, the cameras were ridiculously inaccurate...issuing thousands of incorrect tickets.  As a result of these inaccuracies, Xerox owed the PPA millions of dollars in penalties, but Fenerty refused to collect this money from them.

All of this eventually lead to the FBI investigating the PPA's red light camera program.

Fenerty was previously called an ""unchecked tyrant"" in a 2017 independent audit of the organization. Him and other PPA heads were shown to have been embezzling millions of dollars, while awarding themselves lavish salaries.Though nothing was done about it. (https://www.thenewspaper.com/news/63/6357.asp).

It gets juicier. This Reddit post from 5 years ago  https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/2khzdi/a_history_of_the_ppa_and_how_theyve_been/ detailed the vast corruption of the PPA. The bullshit of the red light program was called out even then by the poster. In the comment section someone mentioned that the then manager of the PPA Red Light program had personal ties to Xerox. This has been known for a long time.

Oh the best kicker. Crumbum Fernety retired years ago after being forced out for sexual harassment, but is currently receiving the highest pension in the entire city. $158k per year. (https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/politics/auditor-general-audit-parking-authority-sexual-harassment-20171207.html)

The FBI investigation began in Dec 2017, haven't found any information about the outcome.

**EDIT** Note, this year the contract for management has been changed from conduent to Duncan Solutions. 
https://www.inquirer.com/transportation/philadelphia-parking-authority-ppa-violations-payment-tickets-boot-tow-20190515.html
 
So in conclusion, for years the PPA had been consistently stealing money meant to go back to Philly tax payers, and siphoning it off to people in charge...while issuing you potentially bogus tickets. The city and state agency running it did nothing because the PPA is their dumping ground for political favors. I don't know how the people of Philly have put up with this bs for so long.

TwoXChromosomes,fdjld29,t1_fdj63jh,1578476392.0,"One time I was referred to see a Urologist for an issue I was experiencing. I looked up a specialist in the same hospital network (and building) as my GP. On the doctor's web page, it listed the issue I was experiencing as one they specialized in. To confirm, I asked my own doctor if this doctor was a good one to see for this...they said yes, they could treat this issue.  To double confirm, when I called the specialist's office to schedule my appointment, I asked if they handled the issue I was going in to see...they also said yes. So by all accounts, this doctor should treat my issue.

Day of appointment, I go into the office...45 mins before my scheduled time. I asked the receptionist how much this consultation visit would cost, as I hadn't met my insurance deductible yet. They said they couldn't tell me, it would depend on the specific codes the doctor entered. I pressed them for an estimate... they told me somewhere between $100 - $1000. Wow, so helpful. 

I take a seat in the waiting room. 2 hours PAST my scheduled time they finally called back to the exam room. Once in the room, I was told to change into a gown...then waited ANOTHER entire hour for the doctor to come in. 

He shakes my hand, takes a look at my chart...2 minutes later he looks up and says... ""Oh, I'm not the person you should be seeing. This other doctor specalizes in this i this."" Yes, really, after 3 people confirmed it. He then asks me a few more questions, took a quick look at my nuts, referred me to the other doctor, then left. After I waited nearly 4 hours in the office...he was in the room for maybe 7 minutes total. 

But the fun didn't end there. On exit, I asked the billing lady the total cost. She said the bill would be sent in the mail. A couple weeks later I get the bill. $375 for a new patient consultation! $375 for 7 fucking minutes of nothing.

Gobsmacked, I called the Urologist's office... they confirmed that's the code the doctor used, so the bill was accurate. I explained what happened and demanded they lower it. They said I'd have to call the hospital billing department. Called the hospital billing department, they said I'd have to call the doctor's office billing person. Went in this circle for weeks until I finally gave up. Discovered literally nobody knew who had the power to actually lower this bill for shitty service. 

That was 5 years ago and I still get collection calls for that bill. Only by some miracle it hasn't dinged my credit yet, but I refuse to pay it out of principal.

This is one of the top rated health systems in the country mind you. Aside from the absurd cost and horrible treatment of patient's time, what other business on earth refuses to even give you an estimate what services will cost ahead of time?  Itd be like going to a steak house....asking how much a steak costs...and being told ""somewhere between $50-$500, depending on what your server enters into the system."" Then 4 hours after you order your food, the server comes over to tell you they don't actually serve there at all. 2 weeks later, you get a bill for hundreds of dollars...for the drinking a few glasses of water in the steak house. Absolutely ridiculous.

Burn the whole thing down I say.  Insurance companies. The hospitals. The medical billing system. All of it."
politics,fde2n7g,t1_fddzp3f,1578329803.0,"I agree it’s a pretty stupid debate.

The theory is that Republicans use these voter ID laws to gain an advantage. Lower income minorities tend to vote democrat in most states. So it’s in the GOP’s best interest to try to stop as many minorities as possible from voting.

For most of us it’s a non issue to just get a proper photo ID. But in most states, getting a photo ID requires a trip to a DMV.  And for the lowest income citizens, that can be a huge burden. DMVs are often only open during weekday office hours, and a visit may lead to hours of waiting (ie time taken off work they may not be able to afford or even get in the first place). They also are not always feasible to get to easily for people without vehicles, depending on the location and public transit situation. 

Plus IDs may require a permanent address and other documentation that present yet another hurdle for poorer people. 

All of this adds up to more hassle than it’s worth for many.

The GOP uses the excuse illegal aliens voting is the reason they want this. In reality it’s to have less minority voters at the polls. So I don’t agree with their stance on this.

BUT I also think asking for photo ID at the polls are a good way to stop legitimate voter fraud.

It’s all such an easily solvable issue in 2020 It drives me nuts we’re still talking about it. We have the technological means for people to register for IDs remotely. Or States can allow for mail in registration...open remote ID centers in locations like Libraries, post offices, and certain businesses the same way we do with passports. The permanent address issue can be remedied as well. Problem more or less solved."

I think Reddit also underestimates how much Bernie fucked himself for a large percentage of the US 45+ population the minute he decided to latch onto the words “democratic socialist”. Probably the absolute worst marketing strategy he could have possibly taken. Doesn’t matter if it’s not true socialism, people don’t care.  The word “socialism” on its own has been the target of fear mongering, black listing, and anti-communism propaganda campaigns since the 40s.  He could have chosen any other words to describe his platform...”progressive capitalist” for example. Instead he’s determined to go on some ideological crusade to “save the word socialism”. He’s even said so himself. 

The ideas don’t matter when the term itself is too polluted at this point to even allow rational discord. My father for example, doesn’t know a thing about Bernie but still says  “he’s a socialist! How could you vote for a socialist?? Do you want him taking all of my retirement money!?”.  I think this is representative even among the older ranks of the left, and that damage is irreversible at this point. I fear the same for all other dems who have stood behind that word.

TechNewsToday,fcnpqxm,t1_fcni6nu,1577816121.0,"Fair enough. 

China isn’t what you’re probably thinking these days. As a centralized “communist” country, the central and local governments do have control over pretty much everything, including business. 
The government owns all of the land, controls most of the utilities, banks, and many large companies are either owned by the state or are in close partnership with them. However, over the last several decades, regulations have loosened greatly to allow more private ownership of property and businesses. 

This is a big factor that triggered the rapid growth of their economy over the last 3 decades. So today, China has privately owned, market driven businesses running along side China’s state run enterprises. Paychecks are issues normally by these companies, and taxes are withheld from payroll. 

Additionally, foreign companies can wholly own entities in China.  In Tesla’s case, they got approval from the government to build a factory there. Though they cannot own the land, they bought the rights from the government to use the land and build private property on it. And as a private business, they will make employment contracts directly with employees.

Interestingly, until very recently China had rules that required foreign automakers to establish 50/50 joint ventures with the government. However they’ve recently dropped that restriction, allowing Tesla to wholly own the factory.  So the government does not have a hand in its ownership.

I would recommend reading up on Deng Xiaoping, and the economic reforms he brought to China during his rule if you’re interested in the subject."
TechNewsToday,fcnki6z,t1_fcndx9l,1577813333.0,"Made in the USA for most goods is an unrealistic fantasy unfortunately. At the end of the day, people may not like things made in China, but they’re still going to buy whatever makes the most financial sense. In almost all cases, if someone has the choice between buying Chinese vs not buying at all (or paying extreme markups), they’re going to buy Chinese.

Things are shifting in some industries tho. For example, “fast fashion” is on the decline by many measures. Meaning people are looking for higher quality, more sustainable wardrobe choices. 

Realistically, the more likely scenario in the future is that China will eventually price itself out, and another country...say somewhere in Africa, or another Asian country, will pick up the slack making cheaper, more reliable goods. Same as how China picked up from where Taiwan or Japan was 25-30 years ago."

starterpacks,fcl1xt0,t1_fckoy92,1577738037.0,"I’m not from Austin but I do recall hearing about an independent high speed rail project in Texas. Is that what you’re talking about?

In any case,  I think attacking rail projects is likely misplaced. If you’ve done any sort of world traveling, you’d see the US is decades behind other modern countries in terms of high speed rail networks. Even China has super fast trains connecting most major cities. High Speed rail doesn’t even really exist in the US at the moment, and most cities are woefully inept at reliable regional networks too.

Rail is frankly the best solution to solve our increasing problems of road congestion, reliance on car ownership, and dependence on carbon fuel-dependent modes of transportation (especially air travel). As far as cost, trying to expand and maintain roads in places with no room to grow is often a greater tax strain than building reliable rail networks."
