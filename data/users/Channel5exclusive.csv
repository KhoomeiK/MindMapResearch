TheLastAirbender,fgjpti4,t3_eydzga,1580849012.0,"I've never read any of the comics so I don't know what is considered cannon in and what's not. I'm basing everything from observations from the show and speculations based on those observations. That being said....

As stated above, Zuko did say that Iroh had a complicated past. Zuko also said that Iroh had killed the last dragon long before Zuko was born. This was a half truth in that Iroh did indeed face the dragons but did so to learn the true meaning of Fire bending not to kill. If this happened long before Zuko was born then it happened well before Lu ten died. So what sparked Iroh to want to learn the true meaning of Fire bending?

Here's where speculation comes in and bear in mind I haven't read any comics so I don't know what if anything is said about this in the comics. Nothing was ever said about Iroh's wife but based on Iroh's ""interest"" in June when she first appears and through out the episode I can only conclude that Iroh's wife is deceased. The Iroh we know in the series does not strike me as the kind of man who would step out on his wife and Iroh seemed all to happy to get involved with June if she had been interested. So I wonder if what fundamentally changed Iroh was his wife's death. What if she died giving birth to Lu Ten? What if she saw how Asulan was raising Ozai, given the age difference in Iroh and Ozai she would have gotten a pretty good idea how Iroh was raised from the way Asulan was raising Ozai. Maybe with her dying breath she begged Iroh not to raise their son like that. After her death in his grief he lost sight of his inner fire and went to the Sun Warrior ruins to learn the true meaning of fire bending and to also to contemplate how he would raise his son. Would he honour his dead wife's final wish or stay the course and raise Lu Ten to be a future rule with an iron fist fire lord. What if like Zuko in Ba Sing Se, Iroh made the wrong decision and ultimately the values and teachings he imparted on Lu Ten lead to his death on the battle field. Iroh fell apart and abandoned the siege on Ba Sing Se. It is said in the series that Iroh went on a spiritual journey to the spirit world. It doesn't say exactly when this occurred but a good bet would say it was after Lu Ten's death. What if while he was there healing the spirits guided him to a path of redemption a path that lead to his nephew Zuko.

ProRevenge,ffx4o1n,t1_ffwsoii,1580317673.0,"I had a similar bullying a bully moment at a local swimming hole when I was in my late teens. I a girl from the small community I lived in at the time showed up with her little brother. She was around 13 or 14 and he was around 7 or 8 and he didn't know how to swim so he was wearing a lifejacket. Anyway there was another kid there about the same age as the girl. He started to swim in to the brother and sister and I didn't pay any attention to it. The next thing I hear is the girl screaming her head off at the boy. I never saw it happen but apparently he grabbed her little brother and pushed him under the water. I immediately saw red because this had sparked a memory from my own childhood when something similar happened to me except I wasn't wearing a lifejacket. I made my way to them asked exactly what happened. She told me and the whole time bully is smirking at us. I look at the bully after hearing the story and bellowed ""you think that's fucking funny? How would you like feel what that's like? Before he knew what was happening I grabbed him and pushed him under right to the bottom and stood on him just for a second. I wanted to give him a good scare not drown him. Also the water in this spot was up to my chest and I'm about 6f tall. When came back up to the surface he was sputtering and spitting and crying. ""Not so funny now is it?"" I said and swam off toward the shore got half way there and swore at me. Big mistake. He thought he was far enough away that I wouldn't be able to catch him before he made it to shore. He was wrong. I caught up to him and basically chokeslammed him in water that was up just past my knees. He bounced off the bottom and got scraped up a little bit and went ashore crying and threating to tell his daddy on me. He never did as far as I know and a couple of months or so later he moved away. Good riddance."

Day after day, week after week, month after month the students are a constant reminder of his inadequacy when it comes to magic. As a result he is a very bitter man and takes his bitterness out on the students. He advocates for torture as punishment. When Harry and Ron were facing expulsion in COS he took joy from it even taunting the boys. In short Filch is not a likable guy. I don't condone anyone hexing him but I get why they would. As the saying goes, ""you'll catch more flies with honey than with vinegar"".  If Filch ever got past his bitterness maybe someone would step in when a student is trying to have fun at his expense and maybe some of the students would lend a hand when he has a big mess to deal with. Look at Hagrid, while he isn't a squib he's almost as good as one and if anyone has a right to be bitter it's him. Hagrid was falsely accused and expelled for opening the chamber of secrets. He had his wand snapped and was forbidden to use magic. He made the best out of the hand he was dealt. He's a big lovable guy without an ounce of bitterness and is loved by everyone...

In Harry's case he lives in a muggle household so if magic happens there it's basically assumed that he did it. That's why he got in trouble for Dobby's hover charm in COS. By that logic Harry should have gotten in trouble when Mr. Weasley blew the Dursleys living room apart in GOF, and when Tonks did magic in the house in OOTP as well as when Dumbledore did magic in the house in HBP. Again by this logic I see why the ministry wouldn't have detected Voldemort doing magic while he was in Morffin's house but they should have one hundred percent detected Voldemort performing underage magic when he killed the Riddles,unless he had Morffin there at the Riddle house with him under the imperius curse."

The killing curse rebounded and hit Voldemort. Voldemort's soul was already very unstable having been ripped 7 times. The force of the killing curse caused some soul spatter which landed on Harry and stuck to him.
harrypotter,fej5cjm,t1_fei2dim,1579157526.0,"What you and a lot of people are forgetting is Lily didn't start dating James until their 7th year. Two years AFTER the events of Snape's memory that Harry witnessed and according to Sirus and Lupin, James changed a lot in those 2 years. James was an arrogant prick up to and including his 5th year there's no denying it. I think he really liked Lily and realized that the only way she would ever give him the time of day is he stopped being an arrogant prick and so he stopped or at the very least kept it in check when he was around her.

Lily didn't choose one or the other. First she was never romantically interested in Snape. In Lily's eyes they were friends and nothing more. They drifted apart because of Snape's fascination with the dark arts and the last straw was Snape calling her a mudblood. She originally didn't have anymore interest in James either. Again as I said above James changed and I think over time he grew on Lily."

harrypotter,fej1lh7,t1_feiqfxk,1579153599.0,"I'm going to have to disagree with you on Ginny. Ginny didn't suddenly become cool. Early on she barely spoke two words when she was around Harry because she was too nervous whenever she was around him. It wasn't until she took Hermione's advice and stopped being so hung up on Harry and saw other people that her personality started to come out and Harry finally got to know her. In fact it isn't until after the first potions lesson with Slughorn that he realized he had feelings for Ginny. He smelled the love potion which smells differently to everyone. He smelled a flowery scent that he couldn't put his finger on other than it had something to do with the burrow. It isn't until Ginny is with them again that he realizes the scent was Ginny's hair. That's when he realized he had feelings for her. Luna was and would have only ever been a friend to Harry. She wasn't devoted to Harry. It was just her personality. Luna believes things with one hundred percent conviction whether there is proof or not. When Harry said that Voldemort was back and that he had fought him, she believed it and she was willing to do whatever it took to prove him right because that's how she is wired."
harrypotter,feizhv6,t1_fehds8c,1579151652.0,"Also in Deathly Hallows when Harry wants to go to the Ravenclaw common room to look at the statue of Rowena Ravenclaw, Cho offers to take him and and Ginny says ""no"" rather fiercely and that Luna will take him instead. Obviously Ginny didn't trust Harry's ex but she was perfectly fine with him being with Luna. Also Luna is in Ginny's year so she probably seen a lot more of how badly Luna is treated because of her eccentric views. So I'm sure she thought it was really nice thing for Harry to do when he invited Luna to the party and she saw how happy it made Luna too. It probably earned Harry some extra brownie points in Ginny's book not that he needed them."
harrypotter,feixbpj,t1_feh3dfp,1579149794.0,"I always thought Percy had the makings of a Dark wizard. As you said he's ambitious... Very ambitious and he is selfish. He also loves power. He made sure everyone knew he was a prefect/ headboy and didn't mind flaunting the power those titles gave him. The big thing is how quickly he turned on his own family and on Harry siding with the ministry of magic as they tried to discredit Harry and Dumbledore. On top of that after Harry and Dumbledore were vindicated he didn't bother even to attempt to make up with his family. The biggest thing that could tip the scales for Percy becoming a Dark wizard is what happened to Fred and how Percy deals with it. How does he interpret it? What if he were to look at it like: Harry saved Ginny in the chamber of secrets, he saved Dad after he was attacked by the snake and he saved Ron when he was poisoned. Why? Why didn't he save Fred? Was it because I was there? Did Harry punishing me for turning against him and supporting the ministry by letting Fred die? If Percy let that stew for a while and didn't get any help dealing with the loss of his brother it could be the perfect storm that turns Percy to a dark wizard."
harrypotter,feiv5u1,t1_fei9l7g,1579148069.0,I've never read it I only ever got a basic overview of what happened in it. The only intriguing thing about it for me was the idea of Voldemort having a kid with Bellatrix. Long before The Cursed Child the thought occurred to me what if he did have a child with Bellatrix? There was a long enough gap in her appearances in Half blood prince and Deathly Hallows. What if he had a baby with Bellatrix his most devoted death eater and he turned the baby into a horcrux or if not the baby what if Voldemort turned his old wand into a horcrux and the wand found its way into his child's hand and the piece of Voldemort's soul possesses him/her. I always thought there could be a great story there.
harrypotter,feish2p,t1_feiiaaf,1579146055.0,The potion didn't stop the transformation. It allowed Lupin to maintain control of his faculties while transformed so he wouldn't hurt anybody.
harrypotter,feis9sq,t3_epc7b2,1579145909.0,This is purely a guess on my part but maybe the moon has to be fully risen before the transformation occurs. Maybe when he went to the shrieking shack the moon hadn't fully risen yet and it didn't fully rise until they had returned from the shrieking shack.
harrypotter,feir5yh,t1_feim37o,1579145139.0,"If you could see something nobody else could while you were in school would you tell anybody who would listen or would you keep your mouth shut so no one thinks you're crazy? 

I'm sure Luna Lovegood would tell anyone who'd listen that she could see them and in Harry's case he couldn't see them then all of a sudden he can see them so he was freaked that he might be losing his marbles that's why he mentions them and of course Ron thinks Harry has lost his mind. One thing about the whole Thestrals thing does bother me though. Why didn't Harry see them at the end of Goblet of Fire? There's no mention of it but he would have ridden the carriages to the train station in Hogsmead to go back home. Can you only see them after your mind has processed the death you saw or was Harry so preoccupied with Voldemort's return that he simply didn't notice the skeletal, bat winged horses pulling the carriage?"
