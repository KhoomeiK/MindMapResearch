Guitar,ffnpoz9,t1_ffn9rcw,1580069055.0,"It isn't super small. It's 3/4 the size of my full size Yamaha, yet it sounds just as loud, and richer. The main difference is the shorter scale length, which I prefer. And really is so much easier to play, it's awesome quality, and it weighs nothing. Oh and it has really nice pickipst, just in case you would ever want to run it through an amp."

That probably isnt helpful, but I just really like that guitar, and maybe you would too. It sounds really great and it's super easy to play. Feels like of like playing an electric."

NOLAPelicans,ffhusrf,t3_etc2a1,1579954909.0,Are you people out of your minds? What makes you think Denver would ever trade MPJ for Jrue? That dude is untouchable.
NOLAPelicans,ffhuiyg,t1_ffh7bjy,1579954548.0,Weak in what way? Aren't they one of the top teams?
ColoradoAvalanche,fffh2bl,t1_fffdgtq,1579883802.0,"Yeah, I always look back and think what might have been with that Kariya/Selanne seaaon. It was surreal when they both signed. I had always looked on envy at that pair when they were with Anaheim, so for them to join up with an already loaded avs team was crazy."

iamverybadass,feig2kq,t1_fei18l7,1579137699.0,Why not just copy the ones that make sense? Why does it have to be all or nothing?

bengals,fefyxcf,t1_fefyby4,1579069977.0,Yeah and in worried about him saying he won't play for the Bengals. That would be the worst.

interestingasfuck,fecdl1g,t1_fe8wnyc,1578971390.0,"Hey did that too! It was an extremely dusty ride, and hot. Unforgettable though, and now it’s surreal to see it erupting."
Guitar,fe8io51,t3_eo3ydc,1578926574.0,"To be honest, I don't like mine at all. It looks nice, but I don't like how it feels to play, and for my tastes, the pickups sound awful. I have a strat and a Les Paul as well, and I never touch the PRS. I'm selling it. Just isn't for me."
Guitar,fe02s0p,t3_enhbke,1578801634.0,Cool guitar. Enjoy!

Guitar,fdpz3ka,t1_fdphcrb,1578646833.0,"Yeah, the only thing wrong with mine was a slightly wobbly neck pickup volume knob. Otherwise, it was jewel-like. For anyone who wants one of those guitars but is on the fence about it, don't be. Fucking incredible. I'm a total fanboy now."
Guitar,fdpz0bx,t1_fdpy2yi,1578646713.0,What kind of bass was it? Do you play guitar as well?
Guitar,fdpyz9u,t1_fdpgrf4,1578646673.0,"Ok, I'll definitely check them out!"

Guitar,fdpg6uc,t1_fdpfg7n,1578627786.0,"Yeah, that's what I keep telling myself. Just a really nice piece of wood with some really nice stuff attached to it that makes a really really really nice sound."
