trippinthroughtime,ffjpbou,t1_ffjbxsh,1580003572.0,"Been there done that many a times. She has a legitimate excuse because she had a bad tear during pregnancy. That does affect it a lot on top of having a toddler for sure but also, there is a lot more than that and I do think my needs are just not being considered in the relationship to the extent they should be even despite the tear. Most women will probably think that sounds like I’m being a selfish prick but if I had to honestly look in the mirror and provide an unbiased evaluation of myself I think compared to most guys, I’m like 10x more helpful around the house, much more emotionally in touch (right now not sounding like it I know) and like 50x less annoying about asking for sex. I’m quite sympathetic to her but since her pregnancy, she dropped intimacy almost completely like 100% no intimacy, had to practically beg for even a kiss for about a year and a half. I remember on valentnes day I literally had to actually beg for a kiss that was more than 5 seconds and she still wouldn’t give it to me until I really really begged. I told her I truly didn’t want sex, I just wanted to kiss her but she took pity on me and gave me a pity handjob despite literally trying to push her away to show I meant what I said. Now we have sex maybe once a month tops and I feel bad because it hurts for her. But on the other hand she makes no effort to get it fixed, I’ve had to book doctors appointments for her and prod her to go. She needs to see a pelvic floor therapist but she hasn’t bothered to go herself. She still rarely gives me more than a peck on the cheek and sex has become such a sore subject even though I used to only honestly ask maybe once a month tops. I just don’t even bother anymore, it’s so frustrating that my needs are considered so little. There’s so much more to all this but I do feel like I do a freaking lot for her and it all just is taken for granted and perceived as not enough still. It’s just demoralizing, hurtful, and causes me to not feel very close to her. How’s that for over sharing lol. Please no need to reply I mean that honestly, don’t really need a conversation about it just venting haha."

First of all, they poop every 10-12 minutes and for the most part cannot be trained to poop in certain spots so all your belongings, fresh clothes out of the laundry, the clothes you’re wearing, you’re entire house will be covered in poop eventually. They are very high maintenance, you need to spend a lot of time with them and they can be very temperamental. The one conure hated me and would fly at me and bite all the time. These are not like little nips, they hurt like a motherfucker and often draw blood. This whole time im literally very concerned about myself or my wife being blinded for real, they have no sense of what’s off limits. Since they were so high maintenance my wife wanted to spend every waking moment with them and we could never go out for a long period because she would worry about them. They are incredibly destructive, leave them alone, they will naw and chew everything and anything to bits, they have very powerful beaks. They also scream loudly non-stop when you don’t pay enough attention to them. You also have to be insanely careful not to open a door to the outside when they are around because they super easily can fly away and become disoriented and lost. My wife loved these birds so much that sometimes I questioned if she loved them more than me to be honest. To say it strained our relationship for about 3 years was an understatement. We ended up getting pregnant earlier than planned by accident and I insisted the birds were not safe around a baby because they fucking weren’t, I a grown as man was not safe around them, I didn’t want to have my child grow up blind in one or both eyes and traumatized by birds because we were negligent parents. So we gave them up to a really good breeder who was looking for some birds to keep for herself. I did grow emotionally attached despite all that but dear god I would never ever recommend parrots as a pet. The crazy thing is, that parrot owners, my wife included are a unique group that are totally unfazed by all this stuff and I’ll likely get a few replies by some telling me I’m a bad person in some sort of way for thinking this stuff and giving them up. Had to make the best of a bad situation and I love my wife and do anything for her but oh man did those birds cause me and our relationship a lot of grief."

Askpolitics,fevmcie,t3_eqm6wo,1579399058.0,"I get the Democrat concerns for sure but you have to consider the lesser of two evils and I recommend you reconsider trumps competency with the economy. Deficit is when expenditures exceed revenue, if you were running a business it would literally mean you are losing money. Obama raised the deficit in 2008 which is recommended in a financial crisis and brought it down consistently from 2011 to less than half of what it was in 2008. As soon as trump took office he started ramping up the deficit to what is currently close to 2008 levels. This is in a booming economy too, any moron can inject cash into an economy and rip back regulations and pay off the super rich and the economy will have a short term boom. Going into the soon to be financial crisis in a year or two will only put the US into a situation where they have to take on substantially more debt to climb out of it. 

If you read about trumps history in business, his dad gave him a bunch of money, he made one good deal then recklessly bought properties that made no sense for the price he paid and then he decided to build the Taj Mahal which was not viable financial and only served to stroke his ego. He declared bankruptcy and stiffed tens of thousands of hard working construction workers and people involved in building the hotel for tens of millions of dollars. He then borrowed from an unclear crowd of shady people because the banks wouldn’t touch him. Then he did the apprentice and realized he could sell his brand. Most of the trump building aren’t owned by him, they just pay him royalties for his brand. He frequently sold his brand and then yanked it at will ruining thousands of people’s livelihoods. He also had a little blip scam with trump university which literally convinced people to drop $15-$30k for literally nothing. His latest scam/con was to run for presidency so he could sell his brand better. Things took a turn when he actually became a real contender and won. He literally is nothing short of an amazing con artist. His visions is about as short sighted as his eyelashes. 

Like I said before, any idiot can give the economy a 2-8 year boost by racking up the deficit by injecting cash into the economy, cutting taxes for the super rich, and stripping back regulations. This man is a conman who’s fooled a desperate populace looking for an easy answer to complicated economic and political problems. Regulations can certainly be too much but people don’t make them for just no reason, there is a certain balance that is necessary and trumps taken it too far the other way, which will probably lead us down the same road as the 2008 financial crisis. I’d strongly re-consider your opinion on trump. I don’t like many of the democratic candidates but a 5 year old would be the lesser of two evils compared to trump. I haven’t even discussed his personal character and overall political competency. But regardless, if you don’t vote, you are essentially giving a vote to the greater if two evils. Don’t do that please."

Askpolitics,fe5lrau,t3_enqcbo,1578871030.0,"I would tend to agree. I’d say I’m fairly liberal except in Canada, the current liberal party doesn’t really manage finances well at all. During an economic boom they are increasing the deficit a lot whereas the conservatives increased the deficit to get out of the 2008 recession, they steadily brought it to a surplus until they were voted out in 2015. So I believe you need a balance of social programs and investing in the economy but it seems the liberals just want all the good social programs without any plans to pay for them. Social programs do help the economy but there’s a balance and I feel our current liberal party just swings so far left they almost don’t care about the economy any more. The Conservative party has almost disgusting social policies and more so an unfortunate chunk of their voters are usually racists, misogynistic, bigots. The other group are usually religious or business owners.

I just wish both parties would get better leaders, the conservatives had went with a guy that just seemed really smug and not very likeable. The current liberal prime minister is insanely just focused on his image and truly is not remotely qualified or competent enough to lead the country. He just gets by with turning literally everything into a warm and fuzzy photo op and being a pretty boy. Just wish there were some good leaders in the world again.

Any idiot can can claw back regulations and corporate taxes and throw money at the economy and cause an immediate boom. Hell im no politician but you, me, most people even, could do the same pretty easily within a few months of presidential powers. Much smarter and much more patriotic presidents before him put regulations, tax laws, and certain restrictions on spending in place for many good reasons. They could have easily done what trump has done and gone for the short term win but hmm, why didn’t they do that I wonder. Certainly some did too much or too little but to do what trump did is no sign of economic policy competence, i can say it does speak volumes considering his past history of conning people, corruption, and incredible bankruptcies though."

I think history shows us it works out to spend during good times and spend more during recession. The difference being that the current liberal party seems to have no regard for saving. Harper had to run a 55 billion dollar deficit in 2009 to deal with a financial crisis but when he left office he had moved the needle to a 2 billion dollar surplus. We are now at a 14 billion dollar deficit at the end of one of a 10 year market that has only climbed upward since the last recession. I know Martin and Chrétien ran a surplus in the 90’s and I’m not sure why because I was born 1990. I just know that these are the facts now and my general impression of the liberals which is largely based on their liberal media outlet CBC, is that they put their goals above financial or political pragmatism.

I don’t particularly care for conservative media, but I try to consume a balanced diet so I know how both sides are seeing things. For instance, on Facebook I subscribe to both Fox News and CNN to see how both partisan extremes view things. Even though I can’t really comment on all the nuances of government, it really comes down to a character assessment of the leaders and their party. It just seems like liberals have the right social values but are very careless about financial and political pragmatism. Conservatives are slightly more careful about political pragmatism but not much and much more fiscally careful.

I would vote for a liberal leader who held all the same traditional liberal values but was actually very fiscally and politically pragmatic. By politically pragmatic, I mean center left in the sense they aim for their policies but truly try to act bipartisan and considerate of the fact that this partisan politics isn’t good for the country."
Askpolitics,fd2z19r,t1_fd2pzvx,1578153197.0,"Ah lol they did elect rob and Doug Ford there so eh, but I think most places in Ontario are pretty against trump. I actually vote conservative in Canada but think the republicans are pretty much the party of corruption. I only vote conservative in Canada because the current liberal party has all the right social ideas but spends money like it grows on trees. You need a a balance between money and social programs and I feel that our deficit has gotten out of hand and the liberals don’t even think about where money comes from and just assume taxing more is the answer. 

My dad had an interesting theory about why the states is so right wing. Most countries have basically poor redneck types and in countries without some key point emotional issues like guns or immigration, more of the lower socio economic people vote for the party that gives them more money through social programs, I.e., liberals in Canada. In the states though, the republicans have staked their position on guns and all the redneck types are hard core republican because of the “nobody touching my guns” mentality. Now this is not a clear cut black and white division but something that sways the balance of power. Either way, these people are voting for what benefits them individually, not what benefits the country.

If you look at Canada, most of the country is left wing because liberals are left, NDPs and greens are further left, if they all joined together, we’d never have another conservative government again. Democracy is the best system of government in existence but it’s still a pretty shitty system. Most people, myself included, shouldn’t be able to vote on the complexities of government because we simply are not qualified to do so. That why you end up with populist leaders like trump or Boris Johnson. In Canada we ended up with a crack addict mayor in Toronto and a prime minister who literally is extremely unqualified and the only way he knows how to solve a problem is through photo ops. I didn’t like Andrew scheer much either but it all comes down to he wasn’t very likeable with that smug grin. It’s all just a popularity contest and it’s pretty frustrating to see incompetence promoted to the top these days. I liked Obama and stephen Harper has his issues but at least he was competent."
