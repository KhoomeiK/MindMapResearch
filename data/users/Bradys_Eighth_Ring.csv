Decisive action in the middle east while having the sense of when to stand down and avoid an 'Iran war'. Better tax brackets. Allowing states to legalize marijuana. A population and Congress on high alert because of blatant buffoonery setting off red flags.

Hillary would have done none of this. She'd be another snake in the grass quietly upholding the status quo, warmongering, while making grandiose false promises and generally flying under the radar of the general public's eye

Are there plenty of other things Trump has done that I completely disagree with? Absolutely. Would be the exact same if a neolib was in office, only without any of the actual progress.

And before you start to go off on children in cages at the border, please remember it was Obama who built those cages in the first place."
politics,ff80v5c,t1_ff7mzok,1579663070.0,"Guess what? I would have voted Bernie in 2016, but instead I voted for Trump over that pathetic excuse of 'candidate' that was Hillary.

This election I'll vote for Trump over Biden if it comes down to it.

I'm not ""Bernie or bust"", I'm voting for what I truly believe is best for America. Neo-liberalism is a cancer, and I will NEVER vote for such a 'platform'. 

And as unpopular a stance as this is to have on this forum, believe me when I say I am not alone.

Edit: Since you deleted your response... allow me to elaborate:

Lol. I want change. Another Neo-lib in the office changes nothing and helps no one (in fact, it only contributes to the death and suffering of thousands if not millions across the world)

Electing an outlandish and divisive outsider sparks that change (and at least this one is keeping the economy going full steam ahead in the meantime)

Hillary getting elected would have been the worst thing for America and the world at large. It wouldn't have simply ushered in 16 more years of the same warmongering, corporate corrupt status quo (8 for the dems and 8 for repubs to answer with), it would have reinforced the idea that the American people are actually content with this type of governance. Hell, the DNC is *still* pushing a carbon copy candidate *even after* the last one lost to a fucking reality TV star.

For instance, here's a personal anecdote - I had just shown up for my first day of work at a new job. I was already extremely nervous (multiplied by an anxiety disorder) and extremely tired as it was my first time getting up early in a while and I had so little sleep the night before thanks to my anxiety. Anyway, a person comes up and introduces themself and rattles off something I couldn't make out in my nervous, drowsy state. So I smile and say ""I'm sorry, what was that?""

To which I get a surprisingly snarky response of ""Is there going to be a problem?""

You can probably guess that what my brain didn't register was this person announcing their gender identity and pronouns, along with both of their names. 

Now I had never before met a non-binary individual, and now I'd somehow managed to offend one i will be working within 10 seconds of our first encounter.

Thoughts of HR sitting me down for ""sensitivity training"" on my first day did not do my anxiety riddled brain any favors.

But at the same time, citing the source you used did not prove your fucking point. Doesn't matter how many butthurt people in this sub agree with you. Citing a source that states only 25% of btc users are illegitimate proved the exact opposite of ""it's only use is crime"".

Speculation. Trading. Mining. Tokenization. Inflation protection (Venezuela anyone?) Protection from corruption at all levels.

Again, I don't fucking care. I am a part of the 25%. I'm honestly surprised the number is as low as it is considering the limitations crypto still has. Which is why your source is fucking dumb. It legit proved the opposite of my expectations."
