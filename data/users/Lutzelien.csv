soccer,fgiuhid,t1_fgilc58,1580831184.0,"Serious question, has any 100+ million transfer worked out? Hazard isn't doing great, Joao Felix is being a flop, Coutinho didn't work for barca nor did Dembele and Griezmann is having a hard time too, Bale had a great couple season but then declined and I haven't heard much from Pogba neither, anyone else? iirc these are the biggest 100+ million transfer and I think no one is really living up to their wages, besides maybe Neymar but he hasn't done anything worth 222M hasn't he? You could say Ronaldo to Juve has been the best 100M transfer"
