selfimprovement,feezvjl,t3_eorjje,1579044899.0,Thank you so much for posting this. I realize that I‚Äôve been very unhappy and grumpy about everything for a long time. I think it might be my mindset and I‚Äôm grateful for you posting this. Bless your soul! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Journaling,fd3dbv4,t1_fd3bi6y,1578157170.0,I guess we did and I would like to thank you. Good luck! I hope you earn a ton of money for doing what you love! <3
Journaling,fd3b35k,t1_fd311j0,1578156480.0,"Okay that makes so much more sense! I‚Äôm really sorry about that. I had no idea it was that much. I thought we were talking about American money, sorry for my ignorance. Thank you for teaching me something new. I had no idea how much the minimum wage was or the worth of Colombian pesos. And I think that $3 is a good price then. Once again I‚Äôm sooo sorry üòÖ"
Journaling,fd2u8b2,t1_fd021rf,1578151723.0,I would say maybe 10-20ish. Between there depending on how many pages you have. I think maybe 15. It‚Äôs a good middle ground
Journaling,fczqp57,t3_ejl1he,1578106952.0,I think it‚Äôs amazing! Although make sure to make them a reasonable price. Sometimes I find journaling products that are overpriced. It‚Äôs just a thought
selfimprovement,fczq96d,t1_fczgieu,1578106711.0,This was very helpful and thank you so much! I really appreciate it. I would like to wish you luck on your journey too.

selfimprovement,fczd65t,t1_fczaugu,1578098560.0,"Thank you so much! I do have a school counselor and I go to her with my issues. The only thing she does is listens to me and does try to give me advice but really bad. The appointments are also inconsistent. She doesn‚Äôt really do check ups. There‚Äôs also a psychologist and he‚Äôs really helpful but the appointments are also inconsistent. He put me in a DBT group thing and gave all of us a folder. We would meet up and they would go through the folder. I didn‚Äôt practice the things in the folder because I couldn‚Äôt find time and I would get depressed (I don‚Äôt know if I have depression but there are days were I‚Äôm just down in the dumps for an entire day. It happens consistently). When that would happen, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it. It‚Äôs still hard to do that and other things. I‚Äôm really bad when it comes to doing things that would benefit me or I like. Also now that I think about it I do get stressed pretty easily and overwhelmed. It could be that but I don‚Äôt know anymore. My mom is very similar and I want to be better than her. She doesn‚Äôt like to be around people because of that. I don‚Äôt want to be that way. I want to learn to just be chill and happy. I‚Äôm also sorry for just spilling this all out to you. No one really understands me and I just needed to let that out."
selfimprovement,fcz9gbq,t3_ejlht3,1578096359.0,Congratulations! You‚Äôre doing amazing and you‚Äôre going to do even better!
self,fcyzrx3,t3_ejdd1e,1578090711.0,Yeah I do too and I feel like it‚Äôs a bad thing tbh
