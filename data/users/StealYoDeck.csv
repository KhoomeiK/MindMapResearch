Also, OP - shoulder length bob hair is NOT long hair. I am not saying this to defend the husband by any means, but clarifying my opinion. I, as well, love long hair and do not consider that length long. I imagine your spouse does not either by the way he reacted. Once again, this is MY opinion just sharing to say he as well probably shares that opinion and feels it is not long - charging his AH response. Also, he is a super dick for ignoring his daughter. That was real shitty. I would be more concered with that than the hair length choice bewteen parents tbh."

The whole driving while high... yeah you can get a DUI for marijuana. So... that is kind of a dumb statement imo. Just bc people abuse things, doesn't mean that's society's take on it.

I have heard that checking your score can effect your credit like an inquiry would, I currently use CK to keep up with Equi and Tran. FICO is not listed there but just read 90% of the industry checks that one.

The second part to my question would be, how much does the FICO score generally differ? My Equi and Tran are only a few points different so if FICO is in the neighborhood I wouldn't be too interested in keeping an eye on it if it will impact my scores.
