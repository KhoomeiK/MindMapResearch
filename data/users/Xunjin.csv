openSUSE,fdq1451,t1_fdq0urf,1578649659.0,"Well good for you ;) Seems this project in the past took a great toll on you, sorry for that."
openSUSE,fdq0qil,t1_fdpznw3,1578649124.0,"Hum... Ok let's use your PoV. So OpenSUSE users complain more instead of contributing, Arch Linux sees itself (I really might be wrong on that) as an *advanced* distro, where the user needs to do all the ""ground work"" to have a working distro, which requires some knowledge which comes from reading and interacting with users, common  users will likely avoid this type of distro, going to others easy ones. Comparing with OpenSUSE TW (the most close to Arch), at least in my PoV, it's the famous *out of box experience* where you just install and you are ready to go, which will attract the user who would avoid advanced distro.

So looking at your point, OpenSUSE attracts common/intermediate users, they complain about stuff, does not contribute, then go to another distro... Why they go to another?!

And asking more, and trying not ""blame always the user"" logic that you are really focusing here...

What OpenSUSE did wrong in all those years?! What could've been done better?!
What's the purpose of OpenSUSE today?! And for this next decade?!

I'm just a ""freeloader"", who seems to not yet fully understand all this situation however...

What's wrong with you guys?!
(that counts as a complain right?!)"

Not saying you are wrong or doubtful, but if you ""analyze"" Mace Windu at the Clone Wars animated series he really shows that he is willing to do ""questionable"" stuff to a greater good... Like Obi-Wan turning himself as a bounty hunter (The box arch).

PS: I know it's a decision made by the jedi council but before they enter the room where Obi-Wan got transformed he even says to Yoda, who is questioning about that being a dark side deed, that's the best option. I believe this part kind ""correlated"" with you saying."

openSUSE,fcffwub,t1_fccv9ew,1577629585.0,"Ok... Well then what's the goal to OpenSUSE towards ""user-wise"" (community) ?! Maybe my logic is wrong here, however if your goal ""**is not get more users**"" and let us *suppose* distro users base is declining, how you will avoid the community shrink (less active users) and maybe (that's hypothetical) the ""death"" in a long timeline?!

Also I don't care how much you are important in Linux/SUSE/Open Source World, but please, stop this ""passive-aggressive rethorical question"" attitude, if you don't have any answer just say you don't. Being like that just creates more noise instead of helping users understand more the entire situation."

openSUSE,fcakouy,t1_fc9e84h,1577571099.0,"Hey kind of hijacking this conversation, as a user (currently in love with Arch) seeing this kind of talk about what you guys do and think what might be better, really makes me consider OpenSUSE (really liked TumbleWeed) even more as an option to my 3 month distro hopping ( hate this habit =/ ). I wish more companies would allow their employees be more open with the community like this entire discussion. Kudos to SUSE and everybody involved. Transparency and ~~OpenSUSENESS~~ Openness are the pillars to sustain a great (and in love) community, no matter the size ;)

PS: Why not asking the community, which they think OpenSUSE should do better ?! (if that already happens, disconsider it)"
