politics,ffhs3tr,t1_fffvheu,1579951020.0,"The fact that democrats put that turd as the front runner and have lauded him as the “toughest candidate”, is why I can’t be a democrat anymore. I’m not a republican, but you mfs are embarrassing af. What makes him tough? Grandpa’s racist swimming pool Corn Pop stories? Give me a break."

BlackPeopleTwitter,ffhro88,t1_ffgvjsa,1579950353.0,"Here in America, when I do watch the news, I usually go to Al Jazeera or BBC. It seems to just report the facts more often and less talking heads. Maybe I’m wrong, but it just seems that way. I will never watch state propaganda Fox, CNN is just crap all the way around, and MSNBC has liberal opinion commentators. I just want news. I don’t like when media tries to tilt my opinion, just report facts, I can form my own opinions. I hate the agendas."

atheism,ffewsd8,t1_ffdzcnj,1579868717.0,Not sure why this isn’t upvoted more. The Bible clearly states that rape victims must marry their rapist. Christians don’t like to admit that their God’s word is fucked up I guess.

politics,ffe7qjx,t1_ffc6vm2,1579838971.0,"Trickle down only works where there’s a lucrative commodity being produced in a community. It works in boom towns. 
Source: I’ve lived and worked in Odessa, Texas and in a small marijuana farming town in California. Both areas thrived with trickle down economics and went bust when those lucrative commodities dried up. (The town I lived in changed the marijuana laws and imposed fines for outdoor grows). Every business in that town went bust within a year. 
Trickle down doesn’t work in regular cities and states that don’t have any lucrative resources. I’ve noticed that the trickling stays pretty close to the source"

He knew his name and would come out from wherever he was hiding when I called his name. He would play and hang out on my shoulder. The other one was a bit of an asshole and didn’t like to be bothered.
