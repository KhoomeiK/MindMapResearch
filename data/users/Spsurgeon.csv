motorcycles,fenige7,t3_eq0azj,1579285388.0,"After 20 years of saying 600s were underpowered, overpriced and uncomfortable, last year I bought a used CBR600RR. When I was looking I was surprised that they all had very high milage, but I found a clean, unmodified relatively low KM one and bought it. The reason they have high milage is - they’re great to ride. The tuck is uncomfortable at first but after you figure it out it’s comfortable. The fairing is perfect - even your hands are in still air. The suspension is adjustable and can be tuned to really plush. There is lots of power and the engine makes nice noises. 
And if you compare it to a new 650/500 the spec of the components is much higher. I think that in 20 years we will recognise that the 600 was a high point, as were the 750 homologation specials (RC30/45)."
