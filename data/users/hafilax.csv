skiing,fezhfgr,t1_fezd89s,1579457393.0,You're also stuck going in a straight line in the air so you can't set up for the next turn.
synthdiy,feyxp4r,t1_fex3pe7,1579451717.0,"I hadn't really thought about power dissipation. Even from 12V, 1A at 5V is 7W, plus a little for quiescent current. The 19 W to go from 24 to 5V is dissipated in the series chain as well but is shared between 4 chips.

Is there enough Vin for the 15 and 12V regulators? It's near the lower limit of the specification."
synthdiy,fevt2fo,t1_fev3vz8,1579401116.0,"I believe that each of the regulators can source about 1.5A, depending on the heat sinks. Say you have a digital power hog that wants 1A at 5V. That leaves you with 0.5A at all the other voltages to power all the other stuff. Any current drawn from the 5V tap has to come through all of the other stages.

If you put them all in parallel you can get 1.5A from each tap provided the transformer can source enough current."
M43,fev45gr,t1_feof3yg,1579392937.0,"I think the plastic feels fine and is the correct material choice for light, durable and weather proof. I get bothered by irrational consumers forcing sub optimal design choices."
climbharder,feuz1s3,t3_eq8gs0,1579391369.0,"IMO 30 minutes is typical of warming up and can’t really be made shorter.

It’s a good idea to do a half crimp hand and a sloper hang right at the end of the warm up. This helps recruit the finger strength and inform your brain that you expect to pull hard.

It’s also a good idea to do some heel hook progressions to warm up the hammies."
synthdiy,feuve01,t3_eqkjf0,1579390355.0,"If I’m not mistaken, they are wired in series. If that’s the case the downstream voltages will be current limited by the upstream devices. They all good to 35V I put so I would wire them in parallel from the rectifier and get the full rated current from each stage and not have to worry about blowing the 18V chip."
holdmycatnip,feuemgu,t3_eqmv7m,1579385801.0,Trinity looks concerned that you might burn the house down.
synthesizers,fen1smh,t1_felr45z,1579275062.0,"Keep the box it was shipped in. Every return I’ve dealt with was handled by the store I bought it from. One advantage of working with a local brick and mortar. 

My first analog four had a DOA trig button and I traded it direct for another one from the store inventory. Might not happen with a Moog One since shops aren’t going to inventory them but it’s nice for other items. A nice shop might let you hold onto the faulty unit until the replacement comes in so you won’t be without."
M43,femypad,t1_felxnd2,1579273003.0,I don’t get the plastic hate. Modern plastics have so many advantages for weather sealing and durability. The stigma of metal equated with quality is going to force Olympus into making a heavier kit which will work against making things light and weather sealed.
climbharder,fej04sb,t3_ep9pvl,1579152220.0,Campus rungs are made to be mounted on an angled board. You'll want to duplicate that angle when you mount it. This will at least increase the effort required to put it up properly and probably the cost as well unless you are a wood worker.
CatsISUOTTATFO,feiwsqa,t3_epctp0,1579149362.0,More like slappers.
DSP,feds262,t1_fedqts0,1579018674.0,Clapping works. I think people often use cap guns. Any kind of bang really. It helps to have the same mic and signal chain in the same position.
Guitar,fedqfoh,t1_fedn6o3,1579017656.0,To my ear the solo is heavily compressed and would have been during the recording because of the sustain on some of the long held bends.
AskReddit,fedpkau,t1_fed5pyb,1579017114.0,Nice try Kingpin.
climbharder,fecph6m,t3_eo3yce,1578979981.0,"I finally had to admit this week that I can climb certain problems way more easily in my Pythons than in my Tarantulas. It's not even close. I hate wearing shoes that I have to take off in the gym.

My other recent revelation is that my body is weaker than my fingers which is what prompted my movement training thread to which [/u/sprayAtMeBro gave some really solid advice.](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/emuwnj/movement_pattern_rep_scheme/)"
climbharder,fecp25v,t1_fe9lh81,1578979614.0,It's never too early to start climbing with a training mindset. Your training will all be climbing but you should be mindful of how you are managing your time while climbing as well as making sure that you rest enough. For the most part it's a matter of keeping your sessions short enough that you can recover with one day of rest and always climb with the intention of improving your skillset.
M43,fe8rgqh,t1_fdzvj48,1578929698.0,Classic power move.
M43,fe8r6fg,t3_enyin0,1578929655.0,"Are you moving the focus point to keep the composition without moving the camera after focusing? Recomposing after focussing will often put things out of focus with thin DoF.

If you I don’t need the resolution I’ll often center the subject to maximize sharpness and crop for composition. Not such a big deal with a pro lens but can be substantial with the 14-150mm I generally use."

Really helpful advice, thanks."
climbharder,fdwlrdy,t3_en5hlt,1578759980.0,I’d be interested in a further breakdown between sport and trad.
climbharder,fdr3xso,t3_emqteu,1578679192.0,"I knew this post was going to be about sand bagging and I mean that in the nicest possible way. There is no honour in claiming a soft graded ascent. This systems sets people up for success when climbing outside.

If I opened a gym I would have an internal grading system and not publish any kind of V grade equivalents. People who climb outside can figure it out."
M43,fdqtv7y,t1_fdq8iso,1578674763.0,There's also the MC-20 2x teleconverter which will get you up to 300mm f5.6.

vancouver,fdh2xal,t3_el3ns5,1578414230.0,I just went through the engineering job hunt process. The best places to look for listings are indeed.ca and on LinkedIn. [T-Net](https://www.bctechnology.com/) is good for getting a feel for companies that might be hiring. My understanding is that recruiters use LinkedIn quite a bit.

Guitar,fdfas4t,t3_el2gcf,1578357308.0,"They all sound slightly different but share common characteristics. Try many as you can in person.

If you're patient you can keep your eye on the used listings. People buy and sell effects all the time. Somebody will buy one and not like it.

The ram's head variant is a bit smoother to my ear. All big muffs sound best with single coils IMO. I also like to put a mid boost overdrive in front to make up for the mid scoop."
Guitar,fde9doj,t3_ekumjq,1578334058.0,"I have been looking forward to this one.

I remember an interview with Knopfler where he talked about getting bored of soloing over this one over the years. His wife asked if he was still doing the doodly-doos near the end. He replied that he wasn't any more. Added them back in and brought life back into the song for him."
diypedals,fddv58r,t3_ekut77,1578324745.0,"Ferrites basically make a section of the cable slightly more inductive. They are typically used to filter out radio frequency interference, in the region of 1MHz to 2GHz. For audio frequency circuits there is usually enough capacitive filtering that a ferrite won’t add much.

If you have a circuit that’s picking up radio it might be worth a try but I wouldn’t bother for most cases."
