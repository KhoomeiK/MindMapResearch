I HAVE been seeing more exotic breeds like Jindo however due to the mass importation of fake meat dogs (generally puppy mill purebreds from overseas) and street dogs. We import around a million for “rescue” each year due to the demand for shelter pups in the US. 

Purebred breeds that are not the big popular dog breeds are generally only available through responsible breeders so almost always have contracts that allow the dog go back to them to find new homes if something happens to the owner.  These less common breeds do pop up now and again but often it’s due to a death where the original breeder is not properly located.

DoggyDNA,ff01izq,t1_fezxhzf,1579464170.0,"I do agree that what you stated is the most important part. However part of being a responsible breeder IS breeding to standard with very few exceptions. This ensures that dogs are predictable in temperament and structure.... the most important part of a purebred dog. Not breeding to standard is how you end up with crap like Merle poodles, dogs that cannot breath (correctly bred brachy dogs have no issues with this), or dogs with sickle hocks. There are obviously exceptions such as working dogs in breeds that have split off (German Shepherd Dog, Husky, and Border Collie come to mind), but all responsible breeders should be proving their dogs in some way.... usually through conformation, performance sports, or work.

Breeding oversized huskies is one of the first signs that a husky breeder is likely a substandard breeder since neither working or show line Siberian come that way. Their conformation is not suited to being 80 lbs. Even those who breed huskies for sled work only are keeping them smaller. They are not meant to be heavy pullers as malamutes were. [This is how a Siberian Husky is supposed to be built.](https://i.imgur.com/ZcuxBpW.jpg)

DoggyDNA,few2w3u,t3_eqm4w1,1579404701.0,"No responsible breeder will have dogs get this large as the breed standard has a set weight limit of 45 to 60 lbs for males and 35 to 50 lbs for females. They are actually quite medium sized dogs which was important for the type of sledding they did. That being said, backyard breeders like them to be “bigger and better” and you see quite a few huskies getting over the 100 lb mark. Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised with some malamute in there at some point in the more distant background. Embark only get “see” several generations back, hence why Merle poodles (a color that was introduced to poodles as it just doesn’t exist in them and never has) can come back purebred poodle. :)"

poodles,fekzovz,t1_fejkt3z,1579210953.0,"There is definitely incentive if they wanted to find one.

Nobody is eating purebred French bulldogs and stuff. People want dogs other than the typical pit mixes you get in the usa with the ability to say “I rescued” but then go around and support the industry that they hate so much. We are in a weird place as a society. It’s why I now support both responsible rescue here in the states as well as responsible breeders. Both sides have unethical options and both have options that are good for pets. :)

One possible source, lots of pups have been getting imported from overseas, about a million a year. Seeing dogs like this more frequently wouldn’t surprise me. We actually have a bit of an adoptable dog shortage in the USA so these overseas imports are filling the demand for rescue. Rescues take large groups overseas and bring them back as “personal pets,” about 5 per person if my memory is right. My dad is a pilot and has flown in entire cargos worth. Despite being touted as street and meat dogs, many have been found to come from puppy mill type breeding situations made to sell to westerners.

I’ve spent hundreds and hundreds of hours volunteering at shelters and have had multitudes of hospice fosters. I have nothing against mixed or rescue dogs.

A responsible breeder matches dogs to families that are comfortable with breed tendencies and will properly match their breed with the right homes. Mismatches of expectations, energy, and stimulation needs are why dogs end up in shelters. (Also, Socialization will NOT fix a mentally unstable dog)

https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dog-breed-behavior-genetics

Traits like aggression have been proven time and time again in almost every species tested (even humans) to have huge genetic backings. Really, anything related to the hunting process in dogs is primarily genetics. Seeking (nose or sight hounds), separating and moving a herd (herding dogs), stalking (border collie type herders), retrieving (retrieval dogs), kill drive (Terriers), etc. That is the beauty of purebred dogs, their differences from one another but also their predictability in temperament and behavior.

Responsible breeders of German Shepherd dogs rarely, if ever, have a dysplasia issue in their produced dogs due to extensive OFA and Pennhip testing as well as work on creating the proper environment for growing puppies. Allowing newborn puppies to not slip on surfaces, proper amounts of exercise, and proper nutrition are huge contributors to healthy hips."

I’m not saying blanket statement purebreds are healthier than mixed dogs. I’m saying responsibly bred purebreds are just as healthy as mixed dogs and that designer dogs are far less healthy than all of the above due to certain factors I did not go into. When you factor in poorly bred purebreds from pet stores, sure, you get a lot of health issues. But just look at this study as an example.... this factors in both responsibly bred purebreds and badly bred purebreds.

All of the issues that are “more in purebreds” are easily bred away from with responsible breeding practices (ivdd, allergies, cataracts, etc) , and they are. Basically every other issue is the same in purebreds vs mixes.

However, your point is again very off base and incorrect and something I’ve put hundreds of hours into research behind.

aww,fefxy6n,t1_fefx8xc,1579068938.0,"Except this is incorrect. I'm not sure where you are getting your information from honestly. The VAST majority of breeders are health testing to OFA and breed club standards. Not doing so gets you shunned from the breed communities pretty quickly and placed on some gnarly lists. Consumer demand and personal care to improve the breed drives people to health test. I've yet to meet a responsible breeder making money off their dogs so ""why spend your money when people are buying"" is a ludicrous statement. They do it because the role of a breeder is to improve the next generation of dogs, not to make money. 

Regulations ARE bad because they are written by people who have NO experience in managing dogs. The majority are written by those with their pockets in animal rights organizations like PETA and HSUS. I am actually currently fighting this exact kind of legislation here in Colorado (a snippet of proposed law below). 

>""A DOG OR CAT BREEDER SHALL NOT BREED A DOG OR CAT WITHOUT SCREENING FOR INHERITABLE DISORDERS THAT ARE COMMON OR PREVALENT IN THE BREED, OR BREED A DOG OR CAT WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION FROM A LICENSED VETERINARIAN THAT THE DOG OR CAT IS IN SUITABLE HEALTH FOR BREEDING AND FREE FROM HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE DOG OR CAT OR THE DOG'S OR CAT'S OFFSPRING""

While this *sounds* good on the surface, and it obviously well-intentioned, I've seen this exact law go very badly in other states. Who is mandating what is prevalent or common? What about issues that responsible breeders have to track through family bloodlines since no testing is available? What about dogs like boxers who are brachy and thus highly controversial? There is just TOO much here that can go wrong or be edited later or misinterpreted.

Trust me, I care about dogs. And I care about breeding only high quality, health tested animals ethically. I HATE substandard breeders. But knowing animal law and knowing how these laws are entering the books in other states, I know this does nothing but harm animals in the long run

dogswithjobs,febzqzy,t1_fe9i54p,1578964674.0,"I’d absolutely never suggest to just “pick up a rescue” for a service dog, ESPECIALLY with mental related issues. The vast majority of dog breed mixes in shelters are breeds that are highly and deeply affected by the emotional state of their handler. Forcing a dog like that to do work requiring them to be hyper sensitive to these states is akin to abuse. I’d only suggest obtaining a rescue for service work if you are a highly skilled trainer and willing to risk high odds of a flunk out. It’s definitely possible, but just not recommended unless you have $10,000 or more to put into a pet only dog without public access rights.

One of the “Fab Four” breeds are highly recommended for anyone training their own dog or those looking into service work. These should be from a quality breeder that health tests and breeds to standard to ensure the temperament and health are predictable and correct. The Fab Four includes golden retrievers, Labrador retrievers, smooth/rough collies, and standard poodles. 

Standard poodles are, by far, the best breed for tasks related to mental states like anxiety. This is due to their extreme levels of intuitiveness TO your mental and physical state along with the fact that the mental state of their handler rarely personally affects them."
dogswithjobs,febyn88,t1_fe8803f,1578964369.0,"You can either purchase a trained dog or work with a trainer and train one yourself. I have a few trainers I can refer you to who can share the process with you and help you take the right first steps. 

I want to make note that the Fab Four dog breeds are BY FAR the most likely dogs to be successful in service work. For tasks requiring a dog to sense emotional issues in a person without becoming distraught themselves, I always push standard poodles. They are incredibly intuitive but do not become affected by a negative mental state as many dog breeds do. 

Fab Four: Standard Poodle, Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Smooth (or rough) Collies. 

Anyone suggesting to get a rescue or random dog is way off base. Service dog flunk outs for health or behavior reasons are INSANELY high and putting the amount of time and money into a dog required to do any kind of service work is just too much to risk it unless you have a lot of time and money to spend on a high likelihood of just a well trained pet dog."

BeforeNAfterAdoption,fe5v55h,t1_fdyj8t9,1578875651.0,"Very few dogs are actually from fighting. Rescues make up stories for quite literally any stray or unknown dog to get them adopted faster. A scared dog or a dog with a single scar = “bait dog” or “abused” and it’s almost never true. EVERY real bait dog I’ve seen has been literally covered head to toe in scars. 

-Someone who has volunteered hundreds of hours in shelters and seen stories made up for unknown dogs an uncountable amount of times. 

Dogs thankfully live in the moment. Dwelling on potential pasts with them does zero good.  With new dogs, be cautious for potential triggers like dog reactivity or human reactivity... especially with a leash on. Be super observant of body language and stress signals. If your dog has an issue with something, it is easily as much genetics as environmental. American Pitbull Terriers are by and large some degree of dog reactive, it’s even in their breed standard for UKC, so I always take caution with new dogs."

But to your comment, totally. You can literally just drop them off at a shelter.

IDmydog,fdtgckg,t1_fdtdbqp,1578716365.0,"Lol genetics are super weird sometimes, I love it! Purebred breeds of all species are pretty predictable in temperament and looks as long as breeders are responsible and only breed dogs that help future generations to be closer to their breed standard. Once you start mixing breeds together it can get really wonky and hard to weed through.

A good example are goldendoodles (golden retriever/poodle mixes). The first generation (F1) of doodles all have wavy and long coats + the furnishing gene (beards and eyebrows). They look like typical doodles though temperament is all over the place for them. 

You can breed two nearly identical first generation doodles together (now F2) and you’ll end up with some CRAZY all over the place dogs. 25% will even have shedding/straight hair and 25% will have poodle curl type hair. Here are some F2 doodles (these are all the same color but they can be literally any color except Merle due to the poodle color range) as an example.  https://i.imgur.com/FvQOjak.jpg https://i.imgur.com/nCh8C6O.jpg"

IDmydog,fdsokb7,t3_emxz7d,1578705927.0,"This looks like she could be a poorly bred German Shepherd Dog or that is at least her primary breed. Purebred does not mean well bred and when you don’t breed to the breed standard, you get a lot of variation in looks and temperament. They are one of the most heavily bred dogs with substandard breeders (right behind pitbulls and chihuahuas) and there are a lot of different looks and types. Even the well bred dogs have a TON of variation due to splits in working and show types. 

Well bred German Shepherd females are 22-24 inches at the shoulder. The typical weight is around 50-70 lbs. Males are significantly more substantial than females, they are a breed with a lot of sexual dimorphism.

Do you have any other photos of her?"

IDmydog,fdp3q7m,t3_emeak4,1578619280.0,"No photos here in comments, I’d love to see more photos. :) This dog doesn’t particularly look like he has any schnauzer from this photo, is there a particular reason you are thinking he has that breed? What is his weight and age?

From this photo he seems he has a wavy coat type which he would usually need to get from a breed other than Yorkie or schnauzer. The most likely possibility is this is a poodle mix just because the the sheer amount of substandard backyard breeders trying to catch a buck with them. 

Poodles have curly coats. Bred to straight coated dog they pass one copy of the curly gene and generally make a wavy coat type. They also come in this color (among many other dog breeds so this could be from many places). Poodles also carry and show the furnishing gene, responsible for eyebrows and beards. We just shave our poodle faces :) Miniature schnauzer DO sometimes carry the curly gene, but it’s thought this is due to poodle influence in the specific size. 

I actually have a standard poodle and a small poodle/chihuahua mix. You can see the mustache and beard on her, though I did cut the rest of her coat close before this photo  https://i.imgur.com/g5X3qD4.jpg


Other options off the top of my head are dogs like Havanese, Lhasa Apso, Bichon, among quite a few others with similar body types (from this photo). I’d love to see more photos and maybe can narrow some traits down. 

Just as a funsie, pillow use and upside downness are always laughed about in the poodle community. It’s their default sleeping configuration. (Obviously every dog does this but they definitely seem to enjoy prefer it over any other breeds I’ve owned.) 😂 [My poodle right now](https://i.imgur.com/wxJos27.jpg)"

tippytaps,fdm9nt0,t1_fdl76ak,1578543294.0,"Definitely can try to meet a few different breeds from quality breeders. While poodles are the main dogs people consider when looking at lower allergen/hypoallergenic dogs (amazing dogs by the way), some people are still allergic to them but fine with other dogs. There are quite a few that have different responses in different people. Samoyed, Afghan hounds, hairless breeds like Xoloitzcuintle or American hairless terrier, other curly haired breeds besides poodles, drop coat dogs like Maltese/Lowchen/Havanese/Lhasa apso/ etc. Ignore doodles, they are rarely actually low allergen. 

My ex boyfriend was SEVERELY allergic to dog dander. Would make his asthma skyrocket and he’d break out. Zero issues with poodles and happily lived with one.

Note for knowledge: hypoallergenic means less likely to cause a reaction, not “will not cause a reaction.” There are definitely dogs like I listed above that are much less likely to cause allergic reactions but each person is individual. :)

If you make a huge fuss every time you come into the home, you’ll practice a hyperactive behavior in that situation. The result is often a climbing your body, screaming, and barking mess when you get home... an overstimulation/stress response. Eventually it can start bleeding into behavior before you get home, then is translated on ALL sounds outside the home while you are gone."

The color means there would have to be a white spotting “other breed” if he was a poodle cross. 

Here is my little chihuahua/poodle mutt for some reference on how the coat can be much straighter than you’d assume depending on the breed crossed. Mini labradoodles ARE a thing, but he couldn’t be a 50-50 lab/minipoodle because of the color.   https://i.imgur.com/L0tjRaV.jpg"

While the AR groups tend to frustrate me, I do understand the need to have a wide variety of feelings on certain issues. We’ve done a lot of bad things to animals in the past and it’s important to continue to make sure the things we do are ethical and humane while also balancing the need for proper management and keeping our rights open. 


My -personal- opinion is that, done safely and ethically, cropping and docking is not painful for an animal and can sometimes be beneficial. I think certain groups of people have done it for the wrong reasons (a lot of the byb Pitbull crowds and dog fighters) and the wrong way and those specific people should definitely be criticized. It’s a weird balancing act in dogs nowadays. I truly believe that all of us that love dogs should try to understand each other and instead push back against those who are trying to take them away from us. 

Thanks again for being a kind and level head in this! It’s always refreshing and makes my day a little better.
