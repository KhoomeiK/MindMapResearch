todayilearned,fcr9dsg,t3_eiiarp,1577898669.0,"This is true but there's a great additional detail about the chutzpah of the producer, Al Ruddy.

According to Ruddy, Colombo and three henchmen met with him because they thought the movie would be bad for the mafia. They couldn't even take the time to read the script, so they made one request, ""Take the word 'mafia' out of the script"". Ruddy immediately obliged, letting them believe they had bullied him into submission and successfully neutered the film, but he secretly knew that *mafia appeared only once in that draft of the script*.

I did this with my wife when she first learned how to ski. When going down a green, I saw a little empty blue run we could take then hop back on the green. I took it. She followed, and she had never been so pissed at me. I couldn't help but laugh a little to myself as she attempted to very slowly pizza turn down a wide, smooth, but slightly steep slope. It seriously almost ruined our vacation, so we stuck with the greens after that :)"
