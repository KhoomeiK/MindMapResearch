That's why I would always have some kind of checkbox or switch on the frontend so the user can set it there."

\-sound a little weak, maybe try using a sample which has more lows and layer it to the snare/clap you are using at the moment.

The Melody

\-nice i like it

\-maybe create some kind of counter-melody for some more difference in your track. If you cant make one up out of your mind try around with gross beat presets (the ""momentary"" preset in gross is great for such things)"

webdev,fdnj58s,t3_emags5,1578586899.0,"Since your question was already answered here is some side-information: Havin your external styles and scripts has some benefits and some disadvantages. Benefits of having them local: if the CDN is down, you´re site is still up, because it doesnt need the CDN. You could edit the external script (shouldnt do it, because the next update will overwrite). Disadvantages: Its probably slower then using a CDN. CDNs have extremeley good internet and Servers around the whole world. Think of a user in China requesting data of Europe => needs long. If you use a CDN he will only have to download your custom html, css and stuff and can download the CDN Styles&Scripts from a CDN-Server in China.

For myself, i dont like using CDNs (except in a dev environment to get some scripts and styles fast, because i dont have to download them and stuff)."
