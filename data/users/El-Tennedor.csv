Like is mentioned in another comment, there's a lot of universal tools that make it so the combos and gameplay can be general enough across the board so that no one character is too op, while no one character is completely unplayable, but there are definitely plenty of differences between characters to make everyone fresh and team comps fun to play around with. Also if you love dragon ball, it's very loyal to the anime with the character moves, specials, and dramatic finishes. The game is very fun to learn."
aww,fep00lz,t1_feox4sq,1579309101.0,"There's plenty of evidence to suggest that allowing kids exposure to the outdoors, dirt, other general allergens and bacteria help develop their immune system to be much stronger that kids who are sheltered from everything and generally have a lot less allergies. I remember listening to a podcast about it not too long ago. But yea same, had a cat around since I was like 10 or 12, now in my late 20s nothing has changed"
aww,feoozrq,t1_feokjst,1579303343.0,Best love story I've ever heard honestly. I think it's a lot more common than people realize and leads to a lot more people disliking cats than probably would/should
aww,feodj9p,t1_feoce21,1579298702.0,"Yea I don't disagree with you, hence the ""most"" part as some people most certainly deal with serious allergies that their body is unable to adjust to, and have to remove themselves from whatever the allergens are. I'm one of those people who is allergic to a lot things nature-related, so spring time sucks ass for me and I have to take medication before hikes and stuff. I definitely feel your pain there.

I get no reactions from pets like I did as a kid before we had pets now as an adult. I think I would relate it similarly to how I've heard that most everyone is lactose intolerant or something like that, so if you stop consuming dairy your body adjusts and thus can't process dairy as well, and there's always those that are worse off than others. Regardless, gotta do what's best for you bro."
aww,feo2xnx,t1_fenojkj,1579294418.0,"Seen some of the other replies, I have a pretty strong belief that most people are allergic to cats, but can adapt to most any cat if they spend enough time with them. I have no scientific proof to back it up, just tons of anecdotal evidence. When my roommate moved in with me he was strongly allergic but now exhibits no symptoms and we've lived together for years. My step brother is strongly allergic but had to stay with me for a week, and by the end of the week his symptoms had drastically declined. Several other similar stories. I think getting something suggested like a Siberian, if you really want a cat, isn't a bad idea and your body will, in my completely un-expert opinion, probably adapt to your cat. Hope you get to experience the love of the floofers!"
nfl,fdhdze4,t1_fdh8yow,1578420663.0,"They're just talking out there ass. From both a football and business perspective, it doesn't make sense to get rid of Cam. He's already under contract for another year, and if he sucks when he returns (which I doubt) then we can move on. If he's the old Cam then we're back to being set at the qb position for the next several years with a great core of skill position players, and we resign him. Additionally, Cam has a great relationship with Tepper. I just don't see a scenario where Cam isn't here in Carolina next year."
AskReddit,f9gneg4,t3_e4y3rx,1575301979.0,"I bought a 3 pack that lasted me over a year, and my current daily carry chapstick I've had for several months. I have a reliance on chapstick especially right before bed, so I always have to have a stick on my nightstand, plus one I keep in my car, one I keep in my backpack, and one I carry around with me at all times. The one I carry usually ends up as my nightstand chapstick every night.

For the one I carry, I always keep it with my wallet in my pocket or on my nightstand at home. So generally, if I don't have my chapstick I probably don't have my wallet, and that's kind of how I managed to keep it and go all the way through a whole stick. It's quite the accomplishing feeling - one of my proudest accomplishments to be honest."
