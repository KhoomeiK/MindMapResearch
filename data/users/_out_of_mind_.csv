Part of the horror of the capitalist enchantment the world is currently under is that it provides a excuse for bad behavior that's so hard to argue against. 

I believe that certain individuals should be held accountable when it comes to actions taken on behalf of a corporation. Shareholders and the CEO at least should be punished.

> And if the issue emerges not from scarcity itself but from other concerns... 

The existence of scarcity is only an issue at larger scales, yes, but as I've said we need to plan for the future, we can't just do a half-assed version of communism right now and hope it doesn't break. If you do something, do it right or don't do it.

> I do, but population numbers must fall.

While current population numbers aren't sustainable, we can't just propose genocide as a solution.

There's another solution to that issue, though. Economic development causes population numbers to fall, combine that with proper healthcare and immortality research and we won't need to give birth to any more human beings. Just give it a few hundred more years and we'll arrive there, no need to violate the NAP.

> Modern ""quality of life"" is primarily a function of energy inputs, and ever increasing energy inputs is non-viable as a matter of physics.

I disagree. Every time I upgrade an electrical device it uses less and less power. There's a huge push to lower the electricity usage on modern devices and it's a good thing.

Unless you weren't talking about electricity, then please elaborate on what would ""energy inputs"" entail."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fcoxtyw,t1_fcov8ch,1577844562.0,"> If we're going to talk about the relative death rates of large-scale societies and their chosen economic systems, then just to be fair we ought to include the deaths that will result from ecosystem collapse inasmuch as it is being pushed along by capitalist practices, which to some extent it is. Also deaths of despair or at least some percentage of them should be attributed to capitalism. 

Most death counts when it comes to ""communism"" (I know, not real communism, but let's use ""communism"" for the sake of me not having to mention USSR/PRC/DPRK/... and so on every time.) are deaths that have directly resulted from the state being corrupt. In case of capitalism the deaths are indirect - not caused by the state per se but caused by a lack of state intervention, deaths resulting from negligence, not something planned. Guess you could count Pinochet and whatever he was trying to do as capitalist deaths, he was causing mayhem in the name of capitalism.

> If communism can occur in subsistence hunter-gatherer cultures, then it does not require post-scarcity to function. That it cannot then be scaled up beyond Dunbar's number (or to dozens of millions times Dunbar's number in your examples above) does not mean that communism requires post-scarcity, it just means that communism probably requires person relations within a small numerical scale (again, probably Dunbar). 

My original comment was based on assumption that communism was going to be implemented on a nation level (or even world level). It could work well on a smaller scale provided that the individuals pool up enough resources for it to function - this would be kind of ""post-scarcity"" for that given group since the amount of resources that can be acquired for the group itself is higher than the number of resources that group could use. When it comes to hunter-gatherer cultures the resources needed were usually things that could be easily found in nature - food, clothing and so on. And we, as humanity, were at that stage with low population numbers. Maybe communism could work in a current world with population numbers below 1 million. But I'm not a fan of the idea of artificially reducing our population numbers... I hope you understand what that would entail.

> Modern global capitalism only looks so peaceful because we still have ecological capital to drawdown, and for some strange reason people see compliance enforced by threat as being ""peaceful"".

The environment should be protected to some degree regardless of the economic system. We're stuck with the ""tragedy of the commons"" - this would be the case under a socialist state as well, planned economy would only care for the people right there, right then. (If it would care about the citizens at all...)

I'm not opposed to communist ideas but, as proposed, communism has a great potential to reduce my quality of life. I'm selfish - everyone is, to some degree. And I'd rather not have my quality of life reduced. That's why need to work something out to make everyone's lives better while not affecting people who are already at a comfortable place."

> Also, I'm not sure that capitalism scales well either. It's pretty bad even at small scale, but the more you scale it up the worse it gets.

...except you don't see as many people dying as with a scaled-up ""communism"" (Paris Commune was pretty okay at a small scale, but USSR/Maoist China have attempted to scale it up and it ended up being pretty shitty; and not really communist). While it isn't 100% communist, this is the closest we've ever gotten to a large scale communist society.

If you mix both systems well you'll end up with something that works well enough, though. (>inb4 centrist scum)

Although when it comes to public healthcare, there should be a second private layer to it as well - the government should provide healthcare to everyone on a level that:

1. Allows everyone to live comfortably (without pain).
2. Provides everyone with a mental and physical well-being.
3. Prevents people from dying. (Immortality research should be state funded.)
