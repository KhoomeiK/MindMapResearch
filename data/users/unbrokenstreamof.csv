mintuit,ff3p71f,t1_ff27f2y,1579545872.0,Thanks.
mintuit,ff3p5zf,t1_ff25pmf,1579545855.0,"I have not, thanks."
mintuit,ff1v3an,t1_ff1v1qh,1579486842.0,Blast. Thank you.
UberEATS,feddkz3,t1_fecrshj,1579008525.0,"That's my sense of it. Plus if your sign is up, or the company point blank asks you if you were delivering or using a ride share service, will you lie?"
UberEATS,feddhsf,t1_fe6bg4y,1579008450.0,My conundrum exactly.
UberEATS,fe8qsu3,t1_fe8l0q0,1578929502.0,Wow. Nationwide policy was about 3000 (per year).
depression,fe5la57,t3_enqkiy,1578870917.0,Yes! So often. Or often it reminds me of the invisible wall between me and non depressed people. Hang in there.
Frugal,fe5209q,t1_fdm4iw4,1578864983.0,"Thanks, put my name down for one."
personalfinance,fe51pnq,t1_fe0jgc2,1578864888.0,Thanks for the tips.
personalfinance,fe51m5q,t1_fe0lnsh,1578864854.0,"Good perspective, thank you."
personalfinance,fe51cf5,t1_fe209n6,1578864757.0,"1. Yes, our roof may need some repair over the next few years.
2. Cool, I get you.
3) fixed payment usually, but it's pretty unclear what we need currently, plus I'd have to pay interest immediately on fixed, right?"
sidehustle,fe3ighv,t1_fe3g5ag,1578849548.0,Thanks! I will.
sidehustle,fe3fx45,t1_fdr9m0v,1578848913.0,"Thanks for this info. Cambly is pretty low at $10, but you say easier to sign up? Any other sites you would recommend? Would you say having a smartphone is enough from a tutor's perspective. My old laptop broke, and I'm loathe to invest in new one as my day job revolves around caring for glorious animals, no computers."
sidehustle,fe3e711,t1_fe2ta86,1578848450.0,"I'd be really interested what site for tutoring you would recommend. I've tried this route before, but could only find scam sites or sites where you need some form of teaching credential. Thanks."
EntitledPeople,fdn7o5h,t3_elyo3s,1578579519.0,Mobility scooter perhaps?
Frugal,fdmbuhf,t1_fdmbd64,1578545004.0,I know. Welcome to California baby.
WagWalker,fdhqr1k,t1_fctj7h1,1578428319.0,No idea!
depression,fdhoivv,t1_fctjal0,1578426996.0,"Haha yes, you too."
WagWalker,fct2h6k,t3_eiqncw,1577931155.0,Hurrah! They tipped $7 in a $21 walk.
WagWalker,fcsx75t,t1_fcsx3ry,1577927380.0,"Ok thanks. So maybe photo did upload then, or it wouldn't have let me progress? I did get paid."
WagWalker,fcsv5yf,t3_eipu20,1577925916.0,"This initially happened to me today on my first walk in terms of time elapsed, but then it corrected itself."
toastme,fco845f,t3_ei4aw2,1577825892.0,"You have got this. No matter how tempted, it's not worth it. Bookend tonight. Call a friend or sponsor either end of the night. Have you made out a plan for what you're doing, and how you can access supports as needed?"
depression,fcn3fsm,t3_ehuxug,1577802195.0,"I'm sorry for your troubles. It takes courage to keep living, so go you. When your old boy passes on, don't forget there are legions waiting to take his place. They need you. Also ironically (and coming from an ex pr guy and journalist), I'd read more of your post as an actual story. It's entralling to learn how people emerge from challenging situations."
memes,fcn1sp4,t3_ei0yry,1577800825.0,Sorry. Still 2019 here.
AskReddit,fclwnl3,t3_ehn3ua,1577758275.0,"It's gluten free, I can eat it endlessly!"

personalfinance,fc69xu3,t1_fc69p8i,1577475659.0,"I think I will just upgrade the monitoring service I already have, and not refreeze. It's been a nightmare."
personalfinance,fc69tlo,t1_fc69p8i,1577475582.0,"Yes. I've managed to unfreeze two, and had to send off documents to Equifax yesterday in hopes they will unfreeze it. What a stupid system."
personalfinance,fc695qe,t1_fc692lc,1577475145.0,"Is your credit already frozen out of interest? I tried it again after my original post, but still same issue."
JusticeServed,fc5ufa7,t1_fc5u6gz,1577466126.0,"I am the creator. I made the world, then killed all the dinosaurs and shit, so you could eventually grace the world with your presence, setting all this in motion."
JusticeServed,fc5rvw1,t1_fc5lxt7,1577464506.0,I am the man who gave some entrepreneurs a loan to start the business which eventually grew into the outlet where the bike was purchased.
