pics,fe0cqd8,t1_fe0abqu,1578810016.0,"I will say compared to most rodents they are a lot smarter. They may not be worried about their father's expectations, but they are capable of enjoying things above base needs and remembering how to obtain that again. And if you've ever seen a pair of rats separated you know that they do feel some form of social connection/bonding.

They are much much smarter than hamsters for example."

scad,fcj0494,t3_eh6jlw,1577673973.0,"So there is a website (I forget the name) that ranks colleges on average rate of return. Basically looks at how much students make after graduating. SCAD has one of the lowest rates of return in the state of Georgia and it is a negative rate of return.

It's a good school *if* you get a job in your field. However, there is high competition. Hope this gives you some perspective."
