stepparents,feejtin,t1_feegzsy,1579035196.0,">I think everyone is misinterpreting the word discipline as punishment.

If you Google the word discipline, the definition that comes up is:

>train (someone) to obey rules or a code of behavior, using punishment to correct disobedience.

If you use the word in a non-standard way, that is fine--but you need to accept that as a corollary to that you will be misunderstood by most people. If the issue that you have is that people are misunderstanding you, the problem is easily solved by changing your terminology.

The terminology issue aside, I imagine a number of people will also object to your methods as being inefficacious.

>If SS throws a tantrum about dinner then he eats the same thing for breakfast... discipline.

This is not going to obtain the desired result. You will get much better results encouraging and training the behavior you want instead of discouraging behaviors you don't want.

You can justify your choices all you want and defend your right to do so. But if you want to get better results, the only way to do so is to update your methods."

>Upon further review of your account, I found that even though our explanation may have been confusing, you were provided correct information regarding the charge for kilobyte usage. We bill the usage at $0.015 per kilobyte. This means $0.015 of a dollar, not $0.015 of a cent.
