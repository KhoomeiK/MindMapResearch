It's cool to pretend that Seattle has some historical smashmouth sports fan pedigree I guess. Couldn't even keep your basketball team.

Prove to me otherwise?

I've visited almost every state and driven across the country multiple times. 

I've got a pretty good concept of what life is like out there. Made a lot of friends along the way. 

What makes you think you've got all Californians figured out?

The blaming all your problems on California thing is such a trendy circle-jerk. People really should learn to think for themselves ."

facepalm,fd5m1o4,t1_fd5jkyq,1578178927.0,"I can't logically figure it out either. 

I see a lot of people vastly overpaid because they get to decide their own salary. Not because of talent or skill. Definitely not because they are working harder than 99% of us. We're all struggling out here. 

It just bugs me that workers are underpaid and not getting adequate wage increases when companies are more profitable than they have ever been in history. Then they get tax breaks and promise that that will finally lead to adequate wage increases. Instead we give them tax breaks and they do layoffs and outsourcing.  Funny how trickle down never happens."
facepalm,fd5if9a,t1_fd5f2y8,1578177955.0,"Which extremely rare skills?

Which is uniquely Jeff Bezos?
Networking? Charming investors?

Granted the man had vision and work ethic but so do countless others.

If he didn't create Amazon somebody else would have and we'd probably still be in similar situation today. 

No doubt a little bit of luck was involved in the process along the way. 

I'm not denying he's worked hard, but I'm not exactly seeing what is unique about his skillset. Unique to the tune of ""richest man in the world"" status. 

He's surrounded by extremely talented people. 

I'd argue your 99.9999999% of Amazon employees number isn't all that accurate. 

Maybe you know more about his skillset than I do but I'm not seeing it. Is he one of the smartest or strongest people on planet Earth? Granted I'm not in the business world I'm just mere first responder. 

In all seriousness, feel free to enlighten me. You seem like a smart guy. I'm just not seeing what makes Bezos worth that kind of money."

facepalm,fd5c6av,t1_fd55u05,1578176149.0,"Workers need to be adequately paid if a company succeeds on the backs of their hard labor as well. 

When a company succeeds, every member should get a piece of the success. 

Instead all we have for the most part in this country is that the money managers figured out how to manage the lion's share of profits into their own bank accounts. 

Don't pretend that the labor force isn't working hard to help in the success of any company.

CEOs shouldn't be making a 1000x somebody's salary.  Guarantee you they aren't working a 1000Ã— harder."
todayilearned,fctbeoy,t1_fct7c14,1577938051.0,"What do you think a CEO is worth? A fuckton of people have stressful jobs with a lot of responsibility. 

If I mess up at work innocent people or my crew could die. I'm never going to be rich and I'm completely ok with that.

I just think the upper earning CEOs are vastly overpaid. People have real problems out there. Cry me a river your stressing over your lunch meeting on the company expense account. 

The problem with CEOs is overinflated egos and a overcharged sense of self importance. Their skillset isn't particularly technical,  hard,  or special, they just lucked into the right work networks. 

Workers of all levels deserve to benefit as a company succeeds. 

Now this isn't a blanket statement to all CEOs. Just the one's whose idea of extremely hard work is one too many flights on the company jet."

We've got plenty of smokers all over the place. 


I'll agree that the south overall has a much much better bbq pedigree but we've got a few people out here that know what they are doing. 


Plus we also have better Mexican food. Win some, lose some lol."
