From the doorway you hear a  sound, like the bubbling of a large cauldron. Suddenly, a voice booms, seemingly from everywhere at once:

&#x200B;

""Ah, visitors! Looks like I know who I'm having for dinner!""

&#x200B;

Your human ranger retorts:

&#x200B;

""You'll be going hungry tonight, fiend!""

&#x200B;

Moments later, the door begins to creak open. You all stand on edge, bracing for whatever horror lies behind it. Suddenly, out of the door pops the head of a mindflayer, wearing, to your surprise, a chef's hat, and his tentacles curled into what you assume is his closest approximation of an apologetic smile.

&#x200B;

""Sorry, couldn't hear what you said. I was thinking of making some clam chowder, but I can order pizza if you'd prefer. I have some board games we could play while we wait.""
