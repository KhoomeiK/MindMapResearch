aww,ffg80my,t1_fffmn2a,1579900447.0,My dog absolutely loves the pill pockets. We actually keep them in our night stands and give him one before bed time. His favorite is the cheese one. Anytime he has to get shots the vet mashes them on the table to distract while he does them. Works every time. Spray cheese is good too
PenmanshipPorn,ffg1wm0,t1_fffwgpg,1579896676.0,I sang this in my head as I read it
Youniqueamua,fffyxjy,t1_ffft2r3,1579894843.0,"I'll take that gladly. My lids and nose are oily, but I also look 10 years younger."
MasterReturns,ffdvddk,t1_ffdv7if,1579829864.0,I've found the best time is right before bed when he climbs in my lap to be rocked to sleep. We keep them on the night stand and just grab it when he's most relaxed and he doesn't fight us too much. If it gets really bad we have the doggie wipes and dry shampoo to wipe his mouth and feet down
MasterReturns,ffdujn3,t1_ffdpppj,1579829276.0,I have a white poodle and he always looks a mess because of it. He did take a particular liking to one leg in particular and caused irritation so the vet put him on antibiotics and it cleared it up. I have found that the distilled water helps clear some of it up around the eyes and mouth and greatly reduces the eye boogers. I would normally have to get baby wipes like 2 or times a week and clear out his eyes
JUSTNOFAMILY,ffarfyt,t1_ffakci5,1579742756.0,My favorite used to be the lifesavers books with the rolls of candy in them. Now I try to give them to my sister and nephew since my mom's gone. It's the little things
unpopularopinion,ff7u9e4,t3_errnfk,1579658506.0,"I have only been married for a year. We've been together for a decade tho. We did a small ceremony in my mother's hospice room with our parents, siblings and my mom's best friend from seminary. We plan to do a more traditional wedding ceremony and reception after at least 5 years. Then we can celebrate that we stayed together after an extremely difficult time. And it does give you more to celebrate. My in laws have been married for more than 40 years and got married in the living room of one of their grand mothers. Never done anything else and are still just as happy and in love"
pitbulls,ff7sp2i,t1_ff7advj,1579657423.0,Me too. But then my work related apps on my phone start going off and I just get up and head to the bathroom
talesfromcallcenters,ff7qan4,t1_ff6w25y,1579655751.0,Very true. I have really bad social anxiety and I'm a manager in a call center. When I am doing side by sides I send my people a calendar invite about a week in advance for the date and time. I also try to sit more behind them rather than right alongside them to take some of the pressure off. I also try to make sure if there back is turned that I day their name before I approach so they have some warning. This seems to make them feel better and keep some of their anxiety at bay
UK_Food,ff1vnwb,t1_f50vq63,1579487211.0,I've been to a few as a southerner. Definitely depends on which one you go to. But I am a grits die hard fan. With a little cream cheese and salt with a side if slightly runny eggs and liver mush and sop it with a biscuit or toast. Takes me back to childhood.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,ff1tpmo,t3_er2a13,1579485963.0,My in laws dog and my dog do this to each other. It was weird at first but now I just think it's the cutest thing. They know what it means when we day they'll see their best bud and they each run in circles towards the door in excitement
aww,fevxmgs,t1_fevdfqa,1579402798.0,"To answer your question, he just poses. Have followed him on insta for over a year. His owners say he doesn't eat the food. He just really enjoys the atmosphere and is in general a pretty chill dog."
Eyebleach,fevv0an,t1_fevm6if,1579401861.0,"Nope. You're definitely not crazy. On Sundays when my husband and I have breakfast delivered from our favorite diner, we order my dog his own order of bacon."
PuppyBellies,feilayj,t3_ep1pxz,1579141186.0,The bellies!
pitbulls,fe6b2rk,t3_enu4xs,1578885898.0,Can you please send some of that to the southern United States. It was 70F today. Normally we would have an ice storm around this time
goldenretrievers,fe5ra8i,t3_ennn1x,1578873466.0,Oh you have to climb in with yours as well? They're loveable little derps
HadToHurt,fe5nmfp,t3_enmztk,1578871872.0,This would be my husband and I. One night I was having a really vivid dream and fell out of bed. I startled him awake when I yelled. He rushed over to help me up and fell himself. Then I got up and tried to help him up and he started to fall again. So I decided to try and catch him. My husband at the time outweighed me by. 100 pounds. We both ended up back in the floor.
insaneparents,fe5d2z6,t1_fe5cp2v,1578867883.0,Thanks. I have. I've gone no contact with my dad as he's a huge boundary stomper. I also have a husband with a spine of steel and he makes it clear that he is to have no contact with me and everything has to go thru him. He really helped me to come out the fog.
insaneparents,fe5c54o,t1_fe4kje2,1578867570.0,Yes to all of this. I don't think my parents were nearly as bad. But I can't even eat breakfast before work because I'm worked up about the time.
pitbulls,fdoza4o,t1_fdob98n,1578616289.0,"This is the lesson we're trying to teach ours. It's been a while, but there have been times either myself or my husband get up and go in the guest room so he can have space."
aww,fdoxjk8,t1_fdoh7mo,1578615157.0,I'm from the southern United States and I noticed but it didn't seem weird to me. In my mind I just assumed that often when service members get out the military they go into public service but still have their gear. These bags are all I see when I go to the shooting range too.
Wellthatsucks,fdm8ev1,t1_fdlshx6,1578542362.0,I left a can of freon in my car. In the summer. In the south. It cracked my dashboard into like 10. My windshield was cracked and had a greasy film all over it. Luckily I had a towel in the car to try and wipe some of it to be able to drive home
insaneparents,fdm42ud,t1_fdl0cc3,1578539310.0,"I don't work in a bank, but I work for a company who manages benefits for fortune 500 companies. I have seen them pull a person from a client in less than 2 hours when it was discovered that she worked for that client part time. She hadn't done anything wrong, we just didn't want to take the risk of liability.y brother works for a company that we manage the benefits for. Would never risk my job to spy on his account"
TruckerCats,fdis3dq,t1_fdhqvdy,1578449793.0,Everyday when I leave my dog goes to my spot and rests against my pillows and slides a paw under my still warm heating blanket. It's the cutest thing
cats,fd9hdgt,t3_ek60ry,1578233397.0,I love the name Dr. Pepper. My dogs name is Pepsi. Never seen someone else name their pets after soda.
insaneparents,fd6i5cd,t3_ek0zw8,1578191394.0,I got my first phone at 16. For the quarter I couldn't have text messaging until I proved that my grades wouldn't drop with having the phone. After that she had texting added to my plan. She never monitored it or anything but there Wan understanding that I wouldn't be on it past like 11pm. I was working at that point and responsible for my own bill. The only time it got taken away was one time in high school I left campus for lunch and got caught coming back by the assistant principal. That was only thru the end of the school week.
Baking,fd5wfu2,t1_fd4z1wg,1578182360.0,I would lose my mind over this and I'm 30.
aww,fd5lrmd,t1_fd4st2y,1578178827.0,Very interesting. I take sleep meds and edibles for sleep and still struggle. May be worth trying
JUSTNOMIL,fd3noeb,t1_fd3lodt,1578160053.0,I definitely will. Someone else told me try this a couple of weeks ago. Gives me another excuse to bust it out
JUSTNOMIL,fd3kgku,t1_fd3j57t,1578159123.0,My husband eats his sunny side up and that freaks me out. If I'm getting grits and liver mush I will get my eggs cooked scrambled soft and it leaves them slightly runny which is an easier texture for me to deal with. But like you I'm a texture eater.
JUSTNOMIL,fd3e6ch,t1_fd34293,1578157452.0,We're the exact opposite. I have grown to not care for the taste of the yolk. I can typically only muscle thru a few small bites of scrambled eggs. I will intentionally boil eggs and cut the yolk out and just eat the egg whites
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fd1k4pr,t3_ejqffm,1578132356.0,Silicon bands are made to fit around the tags to silence them
MasterReturns,fczqony,t3_ejkiei,1578106945.0,This was just too cute. My Pepsi was sleeping at the foot of the bed when I played it. Definitely got him up and moving and waiting to see the other dog
insaneparents,fcwbtyy,t1_fcw88f7,1578021783.0,My mother was the same way. If the Dr mentioned it at all she was like do it. She the hpv vaccine came out my senior year of high school right before graduation. My mom had them max out on all the ones they could give me. I have always had a shitty immune system so my mother just had the mentality of I needed all the help I could get.
nostalgia,fct3729,t1_fcsnkuc,1577931694.0,When my mom stopped giving these to us as we became teenagers my sister and I were very upset. I found the version they have out now at Walgreens last Christmas and bought my sister and nephew some. Now that my mom is gone they are even more important to us. We had to explain how epic these were
Baking,fcrpfqk,t1_fcqrbzn,1577904855.0,So what I'm hearing you say is that you make these to ship and sell.
aww,fcr50hv,t1_fcqnkp9,1577896862.0,Thanks. I love in north Carolina where Pepsi is bottled and it it's my mom and I favorite soda. We got him a few months after she passed so I named him Pepsi. Plus she always wanted a dog named Pepsi so it just seemed to fit
aww,fcpu2yt,t1_fcpdc49,1577872148.0,Oh yours too? My vet tech gets giddy when Pepsi comes in. She can barely contain herself before asking if she can pick him up and give him a treat. She just leaves his leash with us and disappears in the back. Him being a poodle he loves all the attention and looks rather smug and content to leave us
Wellthatsucks,fcptj0i,t1_fcpkgu0,1577871806.0,"I'm kind of late to this thread, but this all looks so amazing. Couldn't get back to sleep so just ate a brownie. Going to be craving all of this in about an hour"
insaneparents,fcjtz17,t1_fcjq3ma,1577704607.0,"This just hit me on all the feels. I cut ties with my father about a year ago when my mom passed away. Earlier last year I confronted my dad with the years of manipulation and abuse and how I grew up terrified of him. How he lies to me about my mother so I wouldn't have a relationship with her. After my mom died he continued to stomp my boundaries and do fucked up shit. My husband told him he is no longer welcome to contact me and that all communication has to go thru my husband. Just this week he went to my sister's house trying to force her to give him information about me. Important to note, he is not my sisters father and she can't stand him. When my husband confronted him in person, he continues to lie about different events and even told lies about my dead mother. But his sister just tells me he's my father and we're family so because he says a blanket sorry that I'm supposed to accept it and move on. That's a hard no for me. I have created an amazing network of friends and in laws that love me for all my quirks and faults and allow me to be me. I'll continue to cut off his entire bloodline if they continue to excuse his actions"
Baking,fc1g266,t1_fc1axr0,1577317687.0,I really wanted one and my husband bought it as my wedding gift when we got married last year. He sits in awe and watches me Everytime I use it
