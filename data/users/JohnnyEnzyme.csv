Walsh himself must have some interesting stories to tell about the whole Ratboy thing.

In the next one, you'd copy your work over, then try out a hypothesis, and see if it helped suggest any particular open or closed squares.  The third tab would be the same idea, based on the second tab.  Eventually by that method, you should be able to discover more squares you're absolutely certain of, then copy them over to your master tab.  In that way you could slowly solve the puzzle.

My point is that there's a much more experimental quality to those first seasons, and it's not hard to imagine the show going in any of various directions at that point.  Also, the show likely had more direct input from Groening those years, which is interesting in itself.

Also, given how The Simpsons spawned a huge wave of cartoon sitcom creativity in succeeding years, and given how the climate of the times has changed in thirty years, I think it's kind of natural to underestimate just how groundbreaking and clever the show was right from the start.

Fortunately the alt / indie comics scene made a big push in to the mainstream, so there were still a few American-style comics that kept my interest, like Peter Bagge's stuff, O'Malley's *Seconds*, Kochalka's stuff, Petersen's *Mouse Guard*, Jeff Smith's *RASL*, and in general, a good deal of Drawn & Quarterly and Fantagraphics output.  Indeed, I think the American and Euro genres learned from each other to some degree and evolved from there.

I'm actually reading Sheldon Mayer's *Scribbly* these days, a ridiculously funny, inventive American series from '48 - '50.  Talk about another guy ahead of the curve, like the AA team."
vintageads,fdljdnp,t1_fdlaesr,1578525319.0,">  in some ways it puts a lot of modern comics to shame.

I can agree with that!  There was a level of intricacy, creativity and detail in AA that could put pretty much *any* era of comics to shame.  The time-travelling aspect was a big part of that, certainly.  And yes, I ate it up at the time.

Having recently looked back at it, however, I thought the storytelling & layouts were frequently kind of muddled, choppy and cluttered.  Sometimes less is more, as the saying goes.  Or maybe, as a much older fellow now, I simply don't the energy to keep up with that level of detail & action, hehe.

Thanks for point those out.  McCloud's and Chaykin's stuff definitely were on the high-quality end I was referring to.  The others, I'm not sure... might need to go back and check some of those out.

bandedessinee,fdh1utl,t3_elcpjd,1578413563.0,"**Young Thorgal #6** - This has been a surprisingly strong series, even though it's not by the original creators.  Still, by the timeline of this book, they've aged the character all the way from a young boy up to his near-age in Thorgal #1.  I'm not sure where they go from here.

**Jeremiah** - Still trying to decide what I think of this series and whether it should be included in my post-apoc list.  If you have any thoughts or critiques on it, feel free to weigh in.

**Marilyn's Monsters** - Odd & interesting alternate history of Marilyn Monroe.  A bit like Yann's alternate history of Betty Page as seen in the **Pin-up** series, but a lot more bizarre; reminiscent of Malkasian's **Percy Gloom** books.

**Mooncop** - fun little look at someone who got caught up in extraterrestrial colonisation, only to realise how dull it can actually be.  Reminded me a bit of Ray Bradbury's **Martian Chronicles**, although much lighter in tone.

**Scribbly** - Sorry, this one's an American comic from around 1950.  But it's an absurdly good, worthy time sink for someone who normally sticks to BD.

LEO's **Centaurus** series.  I have to say this is the best of the author's space series I've read yet, and second only to his excellent **Trent** books.  There's a depth, immediacy and level of intriguing mystery in this series that felt kind of missing in the Andromeda (etc) works.

**Asterix and the Chieftain's Daughter** - Started as a fine premise and kind of went nowhere.  I don't know what to think about this series at this point.  **Lucky Luke** proved that you can still make quality books without Morris or Goscinny, but that hasn't been working out here.  Maybe it comes down to the fact that there's still plenty of good Wild West content to mine, whereas Asterix was more of a historical fantasy from the beginning, and requires a greater level of creativity to pull off successfully.

**Stern #3** - This is shaping up to be a superb and welcome series in the Wild West genre.  A few more volumes like this, and you have to think it's in the top three or so, all-time.

**Hasib & the Queen of Serpents** - A really lovely mythological kind of tale, and a reminder to myself that I need to read more of David B's work!"

TheAdventuresofTintin,fdg9eh9,t1_fdf484n,1578385703.0,"Nice work, as usual!  My comments this time around:


> The **exhausted** self-awareness of the first half of the story

""Exhaustive,"" perhaps?  Not sure; both are rather uneasy fits IMO.  Not to mention, ""exhausted"" is used again, later in the essay.

> knowing it’s tapu

Not sure how much this really matters, but we conquering bastards usually spell the loan-word as ""taboo"" in English.

.

Moving on, I'm not really sure, apart from wallowing in Tintinology, how much this adventure really indicates how much Remi was tired of Tintin at this point in his life.

Not that I dispute the fact that he really *was*, by all indications, moreso that I don't know how clear that actually was for the reader at this point.  For example, since the first quality, collected volume of the series (anywhere from ""Cigars of the Pharaohs"" to ""Black Island,"" I suppose), about three full decades had passed.

Three decades of incredibly rapid changes to society and civilisation, in which heaps of cherished, familiar standards from one age had been absolutely obliterated, or upended.  Now that's a lot of shizzle to whizzle, assuming that's how the kids would say it, heh.

Anyway, from that kind of POV, I think albums like this one and the next one are not only rational, and expected, but it likely would have proven anachronistic for Herge to do otherwise; to produce another story reminiscent of his earlier ones.

Regardless, all hail George Remi, no?  Even his hypothetically-conflicted albums, like this one, are nevertheless rather masterpieces, I think.

Ah, and one other thing I think worth mentioning is that there's a whole bunch of interesting wrinkles, or developments in the standard formula, that we can see in this volume.  Stuff like Calculus and his disastrous French kick-boxing display, or his losing his top in response to that rich jackass disrespecting him, to Tintin's rare tears in the face of Snowy's evident death... not to mention the Captain narrowly avoiding being burnt to a cinder by lava.

Now maybe this kind of stuff represents Herge being pushed over the edge a bit, doing things he normally wouldn't, but by the same token, maybe it equally represents him moving in productive directions as a storyteller and master of the series.

Not to mention, even as 'merely a director / producer' of Tintin, and not just the guy chained to his desk, one can easily imagine Herge continuing this series for many more years, with many more fascinating takes on the developing world on offer.  I won't even bother trying to elaborate on how rare that kind of quality was amongst successful cartoonists, who tended to freeze their most productive creations in to a certain era.

Btw, I'm a bit sad to hear you're evidently not going to tackle *Alph Art*.  IMO your skills, awareness and dedication would be particularly well-suited to that one.
