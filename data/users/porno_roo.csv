wholesomememes,ffeuhzj,t1_ffenl4v,1579866095.0,"It kinda reminds me of the saying, “always leave a place wishing you could stay longer”. Basically, it’s better to leave early rather than overextend your stay. Our mortality is what gives our life its value. And I guess in extension, if you’re afraid of leaving, it means that there’s something worth staying for. Which means you were a good person who had love in their heart for something or someone."
wholesomememes,ffeu9x0,t1_ffeoir4,1579865814.0,"I know you’re joking, but new interpretations say that Hell isn’t actually a place, but a state of mind. It’s impossible to go to a place that God himself did not create or approve of. Hell is a state a person visits whenever he loses sight of God and his love, and ends up inviting Satan and sin into their life. We’re all living in purgatory, getting our little taste of heaven AND hell. Hell is something we as humans created by rejecting God and embracing sin. 

Hell being represented by a place is just a metaphor in the old days to scare people into submission or to simplify things because the concept itself is difficult to believe or understand. 

God loves all and would accept you unconditionally, but it’s us that make the final decision on wether we accept him or not. We truly have free will, it’s just that we’re short-sighted and don’t see how our true will really effects us."

Sure a planetary invasion should go into the billions, but individual battles only going into the double digits of square kilometres would only reach the lower millions. Smaller engagements are just that, small engagements. Just because the military itself is huge does not mean the battles themselves become equally massive, just more numerous. 

You can not rush in 20 guard regiments to take a town rather than 1 just because you now have 20 times more regiments. Instead, you now have the capability of taking 20 separate towns. You can only push conventional military command structure so far, concentrating too many units may be logistically possible for the Imperium, but not strategically."

They are pretty much the only thing the Autonomous Administration of North and Eastern Syria can call their standing army, they spearhead the Syrian Democratic Forces (basically the largest anti-gov coalition). They do their best to defend their citizens and innocent bystanders from Syrian Government attacks, Turkish attacks, terrorist attacks, and assist rebels. They are definitely the most organised of all the groups in the conflict, besides the government itself, they manage to maintain a command structure and even have uniforms. They even have an all-female branch called the YPJ. 

As far as I know, they’re currently getting butt fucked pretty hard by the Turkish military and terrorist groups in the area since they’re no longer US backed and their formal Rebel allies are already having a hard time surviving. Without any new players entering the game, it’s a slow death for them as they’re slowly being destroyed from all sides. It’s sad because they were actually pretty instrumental in destroying the last physical remnants of IS, and this is how the US treats them."

And being overrun is everything you’d think it is. It’s to the point that the fire has grown so fast you can’t keep track of it. You can’t escape, it’s raging all around you. The heat is unbearable and all you can do is throw everything you have left at it whilst screaming for rescue. At that point it’ll be too hot for vehicles to function, and helicopters won’t be able to see you from up above. Most videos I’ve seen of fire fighters getting overrun just end in really horrible traumatising screaming."
