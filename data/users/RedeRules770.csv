And when people say ""one hit is all it takes"" *they mean it*. Nicotine is as addicting as *heroin*

I took one puff ""just to try it"" and then within a few days started making excuses to myself to try it more. I told myself I'd just take a few puffs here and there and I'd keep it under control that way.

Within two years I was up to a pack a day.

So please let me give you the advice I would give myself: DONT. The first puff is a rush of dizziness and then you don't get that feeling anymore, it's about keeping pain away. It's not a high. It doesn't feel good. It's *not* worth it. You're better off trying marijuana."
