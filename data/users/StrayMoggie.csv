I can think of the scenarios:

1. They were buying it hoping to recycle most of it but weren't able to.

2. They bought it for very specific materials and just picked those out and trashed the rest.

3. There was a greater plan in place to disturb the recycling system here.

Maybe a combination of those."

Yes, it's morally correct to try and see the other person's side. But, we also have to use reason and make the hard call when to not allow other's to continue to spread their irrational ideas. We really limit the ability of hate groups to use public forums to spread their ideology. We should do the same with anti-intellectualism.

Plus, it's not the majority who run for election, help get people elected, and who ultimately write the laws. It is the vocal minority of groups that feel they are correct, while everyone else is wrong, and the rich.

That's fine when it is a group that is oppressed and we are trying to make society better. I feel it it dangerous when the group is going against peer reviewed science and takes on a religious or cult like following."
