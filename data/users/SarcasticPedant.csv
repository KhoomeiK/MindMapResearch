niceguys,ff7xg0z,t3_erwebs,1579660658.0,"This is so typical. Maybe if you trimmed your facial hair up, took a fucking shower, stopped being an asshole for 10 minutes, and exercised even just a little bit, girls would be more interested in you. 

Every one of the guys i know like this IRL are always slovenly, they don't put any effort whatsoever into their appearance, they don't exercise at all, and then they complain that girls are only interested in ""hot"" guys and it's like....most of those guys aren't stunningly handsome men, they're just average looking dudes who put effort into how they present themselves to the world and it pays off. 

What the fuck is so bad about girls being attracted to guys who take care of themselves? It's not like these dudes are lining up to date girls who don't shave their armpits and legs and pubic area and smell bad and chain smoke and never do their hair and are chubby."

PublicFreakout,fexclu5,t1_fex5i9f,1579428697.0,I actually was taught jiujitsu with no gi specifically because it's just extra tough material to grab onto and choke you out with. They actually taught us how to just cross over and choke someone out quickly if they're starting a fight with you and are wearing a jacket or something. Even the collar of a shirt can be used to choke someone out fast.

niceguys,feoy3a5,t3_eq69nv,1579307891.0,I'm saying this 10% non-sarcastically....this guy would literally end up murdering OP.
