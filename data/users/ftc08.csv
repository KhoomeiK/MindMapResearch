mildlyinfuriating,ffcc47f,t1_ffbf0vb,1579796244.0,"The reason you're getting downvoted is because you are implying men do not exhibit these behaviors. The original comment was a general statement, and your comment is there purely to exclude men. A quick glance at your profile shows you to have beliefs that often align to those who believe women are inferior to men."

In the number of characters you get for the title you're not really going to be able to mention much more than the one. It didn't by any means imply this was the *only* symptom.

instantkarma,fdxu2q0,t1_fdxt2rp,1578772947.0,"Alright. I'll bring in some logic.

How frequent are mass shootings in countries that restrict the sale of guns? Not very. It would seem the prevalence and ease of purchasing guns has a correlation with the amount of gun violence."
instantkarma,fdxt6x7,t1_fdxsksj,1578772649.0,Because your certainly seem to be perfectly okay with children getting killed in an entirely preventable way as long as it means you get to keep your guns.

instantkarma,fdwy93h,t1_fdwn540,1578763455.0,"I don't like the comparison to being struck by lightning. Lightning most years kills more people than school shootings, but by a slimmer margin than you would expect.

You are MUCH more likely to be killed in an indiscriminate mass shooting than you are by lightning. Single incidents have killed more people than lightning in an entire year, let alone the dozens of other shootings, let alone the tens of thousands of other gun violence deaths.

And lightning isn't sentient. Lightning doesn't make a decision to kill people. Shooters do, and in this country it is really easy to pull it off. But that's the cost of freedom, I guess."
