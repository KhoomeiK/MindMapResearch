I used to do a lot of AIRBNB but it was getting to be a lot of work and there is more strata pushback now. This way I just have to find a good tenant and forget about them until lease time or something needs fixing. I was scared that just putting my money in the bank would not provide me enough for old age and the stock market seems like gambling to me so I stick with what I know. That being said the aggregate assessment of my rental properties was close to 2m and these two condos came out to another 1.25m without any mortgages so I'm comfortable not working.
