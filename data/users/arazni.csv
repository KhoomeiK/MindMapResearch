JoeRogan,ffgukhr,t3_etgz9q,1579915437.0,"The lefties aren't the ones bitching about the endorsement. That would be the ""woke"" liberal center who don't like a maverick candidate threatening their longstanding gormlessness."

Fuck liberals."
JoeRogan,ffgu3ld,t1_ffgqs6h,1579915094.0,Liberals can go fuck themselves. They'll bleed you dry and send your dessicated corpse to fight their personal wars.

It doesn't mean anything substantial but hey, you exist and people know that."
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fepq9v1,t1_fepq0m2,1579327688.0,"I know that I've trusted Democrats before and been burned. I also know that we're running out of time to make the changes that really matter for the vulnerable people in this country, and in this world. If we have another centrist fucking candidate who gets absolutely demolished by Trump, or somehow wins and immediately begins compromising with the Republicans, we're going to be even worse off than we were before.

I'd rather have a candidate who stands by his words than one who waits for public opinion to shape theirs. Also a candidate who is willing to actually shake hands with a Jew rather than a closeted Republican."

It's so important for those in the LGBTQA+ community to have solid friends, both those who will be there for them if they're feeling isolated and those who will just treat them like anyone else so they feel at ease and accepted."

politics,feabsf4,t1_feabglh,1578946746.0,Braking would disrespect the memory of his son who drove off the cliff. Other people need to experience the same pain and shouldn't have it better.
politics,fea692r,t1_fea5pi5,1578944840.0,"We need a fix, not a stay. There are a lot of serious problems affecting both America and the world right now and we need decisive action. Not Trump taking us all down with him, not Biden content with letting us slowly decay, someone who will actually help us all."
politics,fe9q6l8,t1_fe94ksg,1578940462.0,I'll vote for Biden if he's the nominee but I don't think he'll make anything better. The only hope I can see is if we choose one of the progressives.
