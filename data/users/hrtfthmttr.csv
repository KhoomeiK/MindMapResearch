They had a major planned closure for two weeks of one of only two major thoroughfares into and out of the city. It was poised to be a huge traffic nightmare, cutting access almost in half and dumping that traffic on surface streets.

The messaging campaign was huge, and they went as far as publicly encouraging remote work, Doomsday messaging about commute times, etc.

What happened? No traffic. Everyone stayed home, worked remote, everything was fine. Businesses open, no major impacts, and two weeks of the least road congestion in 50 years with half the capacity.

It showed us that traffic is entirely an expectation problem. People decide how much congestion they are willing to accept, and drive until that point is reached. It's a human desire issue, only. No mathematical model is going to ""solve"" that. Or rather, it's been solved already with really basic economics.

1) water. Make sure you aren't dehydrated by drinking 3-5 full glasses a day for a week. Don't drink past 8pm so it doesn't wake you up at night, and obviously drink more if you are thirsty. Avoid alcohol.

2) get good sleep, and get enough. You need anywhere from 7-9 hours a night, plus a short nap during the day the minute you feel you need it. Add 2 hours to your daily totals if you are a teenager. If you need coffee to feel optimal, you haven't gotten enough sleep. If you have trouble sleeping, [try everything in this video](https://youtu.be/EiYm20F9WXU). Different people  need different amounts of sleep. Do not drink alcohol. 

3) if you've done these and still struggle, consider if you are depressed, or have a sleep disorder. 

Seriously, trust me on this. Sleep culture today is totally messed up, and we like to think it doesn't matter. The only way I every feel good in the morning is sleeping enough. If you are going to bed too late for your schedule, you HAVE TO STOP AND GO TO BED EARLIER.

Let me put it this way: there were probably a hundred people that did something like this in Antarctica before he did, and were the ""best,"" i.e. did something nobody else had at the time. In addition, that same could be granted to every scientist who discovered something new there that expands our knowledge of science and history.

Those people aren't on Joe Rogan and Instagram shitting on other's past accomplishments *in order to sell more books*. That's right. He's actively dishonoring others who were arguably more important than he is *to make money*.

What is wing with you? You were being an imbecile. You said ""this isn't PC."" The entire conversation is PC culture by definition. That is my point.

You seem to have real trouble accepting a simple correction. Go outside, maybe hike the mountain or something, and reflect on why you cannot just accept a friendly correction.

I've spent far too much time giving you the benefit of the doubt here. I hope you can get past this eventually. You're really twisted up about nothing."

Yes.

>And if you define it as political correctness, so be it. I'm not clear why you're hung up on defining it at all

Because it is what the word means. For example, you look at my collie, and say to me, ""that is not a dog."". Well, yes it is. You seem to be confused. I'm trying to help you not be confused.

>I can only assume it's because PC has a  negative connotation for you. Are you against ""PC"" in principle?

Nope. As far as I'm concerned, PC is a neutral term. Some mean it as a good thing to be sensitive to others. Some mean it as a pejorative to mean being oversensitive. If anything, I lean more towards its positive use. I don't see any harm in being extra thoughtful about another's feelings. But I can understand the other side.

Either way, this isn't an issue I'm invested in, other than helping people better understand the words they use."

SeattleWA,fdfpz99,t1_fdeig0h,1578367421.0,">My point was that we're okay with naming certain things with their original names already, and that doesnt necessarily make it ""PC"".

Huh? Political correctness has nothing to do with ""original names."" It has to do with whether marginalized communities who had some reasonable argument to recognition are not getting recognised. Whether that's place names, titles, the way we refer to people, how we talk about policies, slurs--you name it. If there is a way to use language in a way that is attempting to address perceived inequality, choosing to do so is adhering to ""political correctness.""

>Im not really coming to this from a restorative social justice standpoint

Political correctness is defined by a perceived restorative justice standpoint. It's part of the definition of the term.

>I guess you'd have an opposite reaction?

Have you wondered why I've been using the word ""definition"" so much? It's because I'm not expressing a judgement one way or another whether we *should* or *should not* rename anything. I'm making a really boring statement here: proposing to rename Rainier to Tahoma to return to a native name because of the ""badness"" of culturally appropriating the mountain in the name of a Confederate *is* attempting political correctness. Simply the definition of the term. 

You can decide for yourself whether you agree we should rename it and for what purpose, I'm not expressing any opinions on this issue either way.

I suppose you could try and argue, ""I was to rename the mountain Tahoma because I like the way it sounds. Therefore, it's not political correctness that is driving my opinion."" But then nobody would believe you."
