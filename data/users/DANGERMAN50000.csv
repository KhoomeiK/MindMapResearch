HalfLife,ffixbvz,t1_ffeq1al,1579985003.0,"1. You missed the joke badly

2. Half-Life is a unique game series, in that its primary function is to showcase whatever new tech that Valve has, especially new game engines. However it also has a fairly unique way of telling a story- *entirely* from the perspective of the main character. No cutscenes or anything else. What you see and hear is what is happening. If you choose to spend every dialogue sequence smashing boxes and throwing chairs at the characters talking to you, you are welcome to do so. I could not imagine a better game series to be translated to VR."
