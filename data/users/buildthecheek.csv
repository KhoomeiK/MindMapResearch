You’re only gonna be burning an extra 100-200 calories after two years of weight lifting. What matters more is the actual act of weight lifting, the workout. You’re burning much more than your additional lean mass. You can undoubtedly burn 400-800 calories in 45-80 minutes in the gym once you get your effort dialed in.

Ultimately I agree. Muscle composition is going to make your body look and feel much better despite what fat you may have. With pure cardio, you’re constantly fighting your eating habits."
oddlyspecific,ffoqruo,t1_ffnvc13,1580080546.0,"Rice beans and vegetables are some of the cheapest things most people can afford. Stop bullshitting about why you refuse to lose weight. Own up to it. You just don’t want to confront yourself.

Don’t give up on yourself. You won’t be overweight your whole life unless you choose to be. Stop choosing to be and making yourself sound helpless. 

Keep it simple. Salt and pepper. You don’t need to make extravagant meals in order for the to be healthy."
oddlyspecific,ffopz46,t1_ffncvey,1580080360.0,"> Man, I lost 2/3 of my body weight a few years ago (got sick) and I'll be damned if it didn't spring right back.

Well yeah, you probably didn’t change your eating habits. You just didn’t feel like or couldn’t eat how you used to eat during the time when you were sick. If you don’t make a lifestyle change it is going to come back."
WTF,ffom125,t1_ffo73yn,1580079002.0,"People still enjoy stories that were first told hundreds if not thousands of years ago. Internet culture is so obnoxious. Yes, if people enjoyed something before, other people will probably find a way to enjoy it in the future. 

How do reposts even upset people? You cannot experience everything when it is first introduced into the world. And it isn’t up to you to dictate what people see in the future. It’s so shallow to not want other people to see something because you’ve seen it before."
LosAngeles,ffocw7c,t1_ffo9mq7,1580076386.0,"Yeah, I don’t think you can unless you have a bike pass. 

I tried a few weeks ago since they were allegedly free for a few days around Christmas and New Years. Tried a lot of different things and different apps for around 30 minutes. Got pissed. Eventually walked by one of the bike share areas and this one had a little kiosk ATM type machine. Pretty sure you can only unlock bikes without a pass at these specific stations, and most of them the kiosks."
LosAngeles,ffobs00,t1_ffnyisk,1580076008.0,"I think you can only do that if your bike share area has one of those electronic kiosks 

You can’t unlock a bike without one if you don’t already have a bike pass"

It’s definitely the typical muscular body that a lot of people want, but hardly every man wants to look like this."
Brogress,ffgxslw,t1_ffgvxrp,1579917805.0,">haven’t made much progress strength wise or *hypertrophy* wise.

I’m not really sure I understand here, you look fantastic for only 15 months of work. You definitely have built a great frame in that time."

Keep it up!"

This post is about progress, not accidental filters, focus on that guys. 

Keep it up man, doing well!"
