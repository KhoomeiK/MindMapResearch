American citizens who never travel seem to think the US way is the only way. By traveling, you are broadening your horizons and seeing the problems within your own country. After traveling, I’ve never been able to unsee it. Yes, every country has problems, but American culture is deeply ingrained in its citizens in a very calculating, intentional way. The flag culture specifically - was something I noticed while traveling abroad. It was quite disturbing, to be honest."

I still don't agree with this notion. That isn't ""just life"", those are decisions that you made. I chose to not have children I can't afford, I don't have a house I can't afford, and I am not a slave to the money God. The problem is that people consume more than they produce, and they feel they inherently have this right. So they buy things they can't afford, which keeps them trapped in a job that they hate, they conform to societal norms (ie having children they may not want), and then make statements that ""adulthood sucks"".

SuicideBereavement,ff37ytm,t1_ff36rv7,1579535837.0,"> I didn’t know such a high percentage of suicides were on impulse, this is definitely the opposite of whaat you always see in media for example.

A lot of people misunderstand suicide in general. It is a scary topic that has been taboo for centuries. There are a lot of myths, and one of the most dangerous myths you will hear, especially on Reddit, is that gun control will not help decrease suicide deaths, because people will find another way. 

A lot of research has been conducted on this topic, and consistently, suicide has been found to be incredibly impulsive. This is why having messages posted on bridges and trains, and limiting access to lethal means have been so effective at helping decrease suicide rates. Sadly, in the US, the suicide rate is so high because people do not acknowledge this alarming causation between lethal means and suicide. 

I truly think you are a brave, intelligent person for coming to the realization that your dad is a victim of depression - because that is the truth. It took me years to come to that realization and only 4 months for you! 

As suicide loss survivors, it's important for us to change the way the public in general speaks about suicide. Saying things like ""my dad is a victim of depression"" challenges the myth that suicide is a selfish cowardly act. We wouldn't call a cancer victim weak, but society calls those that die by suicide weak. Also, there is a push to say ""die by suicide"" not ""commit suicide"" because using the word commits implies a criminal act, where saying ""dies by"" implies victimhood.

I've found it has been my calling, and a way to deal with my brother's death, to educate my friends and family on all the literature surrounding suicide. If you ever want more information, google scholar and Sci Hub are awesome resources. There is an entire field called suicidology and researchers dedicate their entire lives to uncovering the secrets of suicide."
SuicideBereavement,ff35ws1,t3_erbiis,1579534439.0,"First, I am so sorry for your devastating loss. Second, I'm not sure how comforting this may be for your situation, but according to the current literature, majority of suicides are impulsive. Suicide in general, is an impulsive act. About 1/3 to 80% of suicides are impulsive acts and 24% of people who decided to kill themselves made the decision in less than 5 minutes! Citation if you'd like: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp0805923

This just sadly proves how little we know about the nature of suicide, and why limiting access to lethal means is crucial in decreasing suicide deaths. My brother impulsively decided to shoot himself on his 24th birthday. 

I think it's incredibly brave of you to acknowledge that your dad would be alive if not for his illness. I've found that while going through all the stages of grief, I've hated my brother. I spent years hating him for his impulsive decision. But after spending years on also educating myself on the nature of suicidality, I've learned that we still have so far to go in understanding the impulsiveness of suicide. I think it's a sign of emotional maturity and understanding, that you are able to hate the impulse - and not the person. 

I wish I had more words of condolences for you, but just know that a lot of us here have lost loved ones due to an impulsive act and you aren't alone in this. <3"

I 100% agree. I don't think anyone is questioning it, sadly. And that's probably what makes us fence sitters to begin with. We are probably more likely to question important decisions in our lives, and weigh all the possibilities. I think majority of people do not do this cost/benefit analysis and just go along with the mainstream lifescript. It's almost as if our thoughtfulness is a blessing and a curse."

This happened to one of my best friends! I was her maid of honor, then she had one kid with special needs. Then she continued having children, despite having terrible postpartum depression. She's now up to three children, four including her husband's child from a previous marriage. I watched her identity as a strong educated woman slowly wither away to nothing. We now haven't spoken in over 4 years. I got engaged, married, etc and she never once reached out to congratulate me.

This is a really great point! I think my nursing background gives me the unique ability to prioritize almost any need, including my own. Some things are nice to have, some things are a necessity. For me, personally, friendships are a necessity - not just nice to have. 

Sadly, I think a lot of women put their child's friendship preferences over their own. This is even what some users in this post have already said. ""My child likes this kid but doesn't like this kid, so we have to have play dates with this kid instead"". 

I'm not trying to be rude, I honestly don't understand this mindset. I am trying to understand, but the truth is - I don't WANT to be that kind of parent. And is that what it takes to be a decent parent? If so, I don't want to be a parent, then. I want to prioritize my sense of self, because I believe a well-adjusted mom makes a well-adjusted child."

I agree the different schedules can complicate things. I'm a registered nurse so sometimes my schedule is out of sync with my other friends who work more traditional 9-5s. However, I still think it comes down to people prioritizing different things. Some people prioritize exercise, other hobbies, etc over friendships. Some people prioritize money over friendships. I don't think it's adulthood, I think it's priorities. And you get to choose what kind of life you want to have."
Fencesitter,feygn5t,t1_fey0b5b,1579445269.0,"This is a huge fear of mine and something I’m working on in therapy. My husband does want a child, and I’m the fence sitter. I always tell him how terrified I am of losing my identity. But I am learning that while that’s a very real concern, it is also an irrational thought. So I need to sift through all the feelings to figure out am I on the fence out of fear or out of desire. My therapist is helping me with CBT to challenge those thoughts. I think women have accepted the fact, even have been pressure by society - that their entire life should revolve around their child. I don’t believe in this type of parenting. So I don’t believe I would actually lose my identity.

Fencesitter,feyff3p,t1_fex8zak,1579444790.0,"This is what I don’t understand. There is a new type of parenting in our millennial generation, where I feel the children dictate the lives of their parents. Growing up, I was never raised like that. My parents took us places they wanted to go, and we either enjoyed it or we didn’t. My parents didn’t set up play dates. It wasn’t until I was in maybe middle school, that I would go to sleepovers etc. I turned out just fine and my friendships are one of the most important aspects of my adult life.

As a childless adult right now, I’m losing more and more friends to motherhood. And it really hurts. Some of my mom friends are amazing and have managed to maintain their identity, while also maintaining their friendships as well. But some didn’t. And I’m sorry to be blunt, but I don’t understand why some women can’t manage to maintain their friendships.
