Hipfire is underrated as a last minute kneejerk reaction, the laser typically goes unnoticed and when it is noticed it can be used to draw attention for a cheap kill, and suppressed pistols are perfect for stealthily destroying cams, drones, gadgets, and downed operators without giving away your position (plus if you miss they don't get a shot indicator)."

Denver,fcvms6m,t1_fcvf3w1,1578005460.0,"Have you considered that that's due to things just not appealing to every audience? How many black families do you know that do escape rooms and bar crawls in Boulder every weekend? How many members of our extremely large Asian population in Aurora do you see biking down 16th and going to Milk/The Church?

I'm a transplant from Maryland, the melting pot of the East Coast, so I'm used to inclusion and diversity being a normal part of life. Denver doesn't seem all that different to me; whiter, maybe, but that comes with Colorado being a large southwest state instead of an extremely dense port state that's 90% city sprawl. And frankly, I encounter less racism on a regular basis here than I ever did in Maryland, DC, or New York (as long as I stay out of Pueblo, that is. Fuck Pueblo) and we're arguably more intermixed than somewhere like Baltimore with its well-defined projects and """"""ethnic"""""" neighbourhoods.

Like fuck, dude, if you think the average Denver local rarely sees non-white folks, you've never been to Five Points, Capitol Hill, LoDo, Aurora, inside DIA, or onboard any RTD bus/train. Not everyone lives in RiNo, LoHi and Greenwood, you know.

(I know I'm including Aurora here as though it's an overgrown neighbourhood and not its own city, and that's because as someone living on the Denver/Aurora border, it basically is, just one with its own local government. Aurora is a city in the way Highlands Ranch is a city.)"
Denver,fcvl493,t1_fcum17l,1578004424.0,"Don't let Aurora get you down, it's plenty nice and has some great food options. And even if you did end up somewhere more suburbia in Aurora, downtown's a short little hop."
airsoftcirclejerk,fcvku02,t1_fcveqke,1578004246.0,"They did a lot of small subtle changes to most of the guns, either to avoid copyright issues (the X16) or just for looks (the magazine release on the Holger)."
MaliciousCompliance,fcrdsod,t1_fcpz2c9,1577900472.0,"The United States has anti-monopoly laws for most businesses, ensuring you cannot be the only option in an area for people to go to. For example, if there are 10 fast food spots in a neighbourhood, it's illegal for all 10 to be a McDonald's. The exception for this tends to be utilities; due to the extremely high cost of entry to become a utility company, as well as the necessary oversight required for such essential services, most places tend to only have one option for either their city or even their whole state (looking at you, BG&E).

Now, given that internet and cable are services in the same way your phone or a streaming company are services, they really shouldn't be considered utilities. However, telecommunications companies are one of the largest lobbies in the country, and have successfully convinced state governments and to some degree the national government to consider them a utility and thus immune to anti-monopoly laws; this has been challenged recently with some districts requiring that they allow fair competition to put up their cable or share cables to allow freedom of choice (most famously with Google basically suing their way through the country to set up fiber).

This is further amplified by our FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, being backed almost entirely by telecoms companies, and doing things such as cutting most oversight and restrictions over these companies and eliminating Net Neutrality provisions.

As such, we now live in a country where companies providing an optional service can pass themselves off as a utility, yet be immune to the regulations a utility would be, allowing them to charge basically whatever the fuck they want without repercussions as the average American tends to only have two or three ISPs in their area, typically with only Comcast or maybe Verizon having gigabit speeds."
MaliciousCompliance,fcrb2jv,t1_fcqxlnz,1577899374.0,"I'm so close to going to CenturyLink. Xfinity aka Comcast are charging like 150/month for gigabit that is never really that fast and for unlimited data when most ISPs have unlimited to begin with (seeing as it's 2020, not 1995). Gigabit at CL is 65/month and unlimited."
