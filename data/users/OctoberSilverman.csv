In such a case, what I described earlier would be alternate universes, while what you're describing would be a parallel universe."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fgbnbck,t1_fg8m846,1580663931.0,"I like the theory of time as a dimension, which supports what your comment of how it all happens simultaneously. However, we only perceive it  chronologically in a forward direction. 

There's no theory that I know of that can allow for us to move in this dimension any other way, so it's inconsequential ,imo, to think too much about it at this time. 

Can you please provide more insight into your thoughts our this? I'm genuinely interested, and I won't be condescending or anything. I like to have these discussions."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fgbjopy,t1_fg8fgbw,1580662753.0,Yes! I knew I heard it somewhere.
