If you have little enough need of a pc that yours has been sitting around though, then you can probably make better use of the money."

Showerthoughts,fdyu925,t1_fdypsnu,1578783619.0,"Every mathematical resource in every language will tell you the same thing, but for exemple in the encyclopedia Britannica in layman terms, some excerpts :

>The confusion about infinite numbers was resolved by the German mathematician [Georg Cantor](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Georg-Ferdinand-Ludwig-Philipp-Cantor) beginning in 1873. First Cantor rigorously demonstrated that the set of rational numbers (fractions) is the same size as the counting numbers; hence, they are called countable, or denumerable. Of course this came as no real shock, but later that same year Cantor proved the surprising result that not all infinities are equal. Using a so-called “diagonal argument,” Cantor showed that the size of the counting numbers is strictly less than the size of the real numbers. This result is known as [Cantor’s theorem](https://www.britannica.com/science/Cantors-theorem).
