A functionalist perspective provides a more stable, realistic, and useful look at history and sociology. CF is about nothing more than searching for disparities in resource allocation among populations and then assigning victimhood based on race or sex, and a conflict theorist will see nothing other than that. Marx was wrong about capitalism's ability to adjust to fit the needs of the workers through collective bargaining and the welfare state, which then thwarted the ""inevitable"" socialist/communist revolution, and he was wrong that the human experience is based solely on conflict and oppression. In conflict theory there is no accounting for global stability, human improvement or collective achievement, or individual achievement. CF is just another one of Marx's bad ideas. Maybe you ought to go back to your community college and try not to swallow the whole hook this time."
