Only because my FIL keeps calling her like a thousand times a day in the exact same way constantly, but still, was really weird to hear her being called from the first floor in the weekend while I knew everybody was still sounds asleep on the second floor (accept the cast, as she wasn't allowed on the second floor)."

toastme,fexfmej,t3_eqrov1,1579430198.0,"Dear u/bella_kate. I know life can be hard and seeing yourself as beautiful or even worthy can be really tough. But girl, you have the kindest eyes and the sweetest smile and everyone who doesn't appreciate you isn't even worthy of your time. Stay true to yourself, and try looking in the mirror more often and see for yourself what all of us are seeing in your picture instead of pointing out the flaws to yourself. If you do this and keep this up, I promise you: your self esteem will grow and you will slowly appreciate yourself more and more."

Cheese,feppjkm,t1_fepf3m1,1579327034.0,Have you already tried the cheese tea? They were serving it here in the Netherlands for some time at some pretentious coffee bars.
whatsthisplant,fem41lr,t1_fekfq5c,1579239035.0,"Man, we have one of those in the office. They take the little ones that grow underneath the big plant on the bottom, and plant them first for a couple of days to weeks in a little cup of water, and than in their own pot. These things multiply rapid, and almost everybody had one on their desk by now (little over a year since the first part was bought). Also a funny fact: here in the Netherlands we call this a pancake plant.  Have fun with it."
AmItheAsshole,fem3lur,t3_epqqm8,1579238630.0,"My dad is is in the process of buying a house right now, and I believe there is something in the contract that says that once everything is signed by the buyer and the vendor officially, everything as it is is owned by the buyer. Don't you have something like that in your contact? Maybe you could talk to your real estate agent or a legal agent where you stand legally on this, but my guess is they have no grounds in which they can claim any money from you. Let them sue you, I'm almost certain they can't claim anything. And if they keep harassing you: call the cops on them, because for what I can judge by your story they are just assholes who want a piece of the pie they are not entitled to."

AmItheAsshole,fcz3yqo,t3_ejkij2,1578093185.0,"NTA, if they need to do extra things, they should at least consult with you. It is indeed not about the money, it's about the letting you know. It's the same with your car at the garage. If you out it there for a window fix, you do not want it back with the mentioning they also changed the tires for you because they wore out. Off course it's necessary, but they should consult with you beforehand, whether that's before you turn your car in or when it's already there and they just give you a call."

I mean it would already be obviously wrong when your in the gate and everyone had a 0 on his head. I wouldn't care what number the pilot had, I just would have noped out of there in no time. That having said, I rarely see the pilot when flying airplanes, they almost always enter the plane way earlier than I am at the gate or they have a different entrance to the plane."
