Connecticut,ffg4f4s,t3_etfchr,1579898230.0,"Hello, I've done IT work for our local police department and recently assisted in troubleshooting an ALPR camera. Almost all police departments have at least one vehicle with an ALPR system installed (Automated License Plate Reader). Most newly purchased police cruisers come with the system installed. Older cruisers need to be retrofitted. Typically a municipality with retrofit a few vehicles, then cover the rest as they replace their fleet. So, if your local PD just got new cruisers its almost a sure bet they are all equipped with one.

The camera is very easy to spot usually, and works very quickly. It works in about one or two seconds, and newer cameras can read multiple plates at a wide angle rather than having to zoom into just one at a time.

If your plate is expired, and your plate comes into view, an alarm chirps and highlights the car. He literally didn't even need touch his computer and he had you. I'm sorry it had to happen to you! Back in the day you could get away with expired plates for a little while :)
