I drive past one of the Mormon churches at least twice every day and I can count on one hand how many times I’ve seen more than one car in the parking lot. When I saw missionaries at Walmart once, they were telling me how much TSCC was growing on the island (not even close). I mentioned the lack of cars I see, and was told, “Oh, yeah, that church is still flooded.” (We had major flooding almost two years ago and that location wasn’t at all affected.) I said, “Yeah, someone’s been lying to you. Maybe you should go there and check it out for yourselves.” They excused themselves quickly."
