**Children of Blood and Bone** and **Children of Virtue and Vengenace** by **Tomi Adeyemi**

**Forward** - Anthology, (Not all black writers, but N. K. Jemisin's contribution (**Emergency Skin**) free on kindle and audio right now w/ amazon prime.     

**The Book of Night Women** by  **Marlon James**

**A People's Future of the United States** - Anthology.  Again, not all are black writers.  Lots of short stories with different points of view from oppressed peoples (25 authors).

In the middle of a re-read of the **Broken Earth** series by **N. K. Jemisin**

And after that, I have a ton of short stories from Amazon free thing stuff that I plan to read, but probably only the ones written by black authors.  Or I might read **Lilith's Brood** again.  :)"

fishkeeping,ff4zcqq,t1_ff4lgik,1579576109.0,"I wouldn't say ""don't"" by any means.  Do plants.  Find lists and youtubes and such that will help you figure out beginner plants and how to grow them.  Floating plants are a great place to start.  They suck up so much toxins and multiply like bunnies.  I personally love water lettuce, though it's a mess to ""trim"" sometimes.

Definitely don't cycle your tank w/ fish in it.  It's not healthy for them and could kill them.  I have heard of people putting half a shrimp in there, tho.  :)  If you have any other fishkeeping friends locally, get some of their beneficial bacteria to put in your filter (make sure it stays wet).

Plants will help your fish survive, and it's a lot easier to get them started before you put fish in than it is to plant with fish in the tank. It should benefit your cycling as well.  But you're still looking at 4-6 weeks.  Maybe check out some info about hardscaping.  You can do that before the tank is cycled, too."
fishkeeping,ff4yo7t,t3_ergtre,1579575628.0,"I was unable to keep my dwarf gouramis together, though plenty of people do it all the time.  I'm not sure what my issue is.  Could be the # of them, or sex/number, or other schools, but they fought and are now in separate tanks.  Anyway, there are some variables to keep in mind, so you will want to research the type you want, what sexes they should be to get along, what size tank they need, what size school they are best in, and what other fish are in the tank.

Just because the internet says that your fish will get along doesn't mean they will.  Keep a good eye on them.  Their fins make it easy to see if they're going after each other, if you don't see aggressive behavior, yourself.  Be prepared to separate them if you have to.

I do have strips for grouping for the tanks, it's just that there is so much stuff.  I did add sponge filters to all my tanks so that the air pumps weren't just pumping air.  I think the hardest part about this is that the strips all have that very stiff unbendable cord, so they're harder to manipulate.  Seems I wrestle with that more than anything.  I went ahead and unplugged everything and reorganized, but they're already messed up again lol.

It's fantastic!  I've always loved greek mythology, but I reeeally loved her POV, and the writing was stellar.  The narration was great in the audiobook, also.  I'm really not sure how much it would appeal to people who are not as fond of that sort of myhtology, but I feel like it could stand on its own, though it's cool to know who the players are.  There is a PDF that comes with the audiobook that describes the cast of characters and their relationships to other characters, so that was helpful.

This bath will also stimulate the protective slime coat, which will further enhance the fish’s’ ability to cope with the disease.""

Make sure you pay attention to this part: "" For the record, some fish do not respond well to a salt bath (i.e. some barbs, tetras, catfish and koi). A heavy concentration can make them loose their equilibrium and they simply “roll over”. ""

so i wondered what else he'd fucked me around about. he kept pushing me to go to rheumies, who all said basically the same thing.  he said i had copd and i do not, unless quitting smoking 'cures' it (it does not).  he gave me a mh dx, which he has no expertise in (and was completely wrong about), etc.  He fired me cuz I left a bad survey review that I was sent from his office.

The money is in rehab/rehab meds, which is the nutshell bottom line for all this.  Created a manufactured 'crisis' which fucked us all over, while 1. they pitted us against addicts and 2. they got it all set up to funnel us into rehab for their pockets.  Didn't hurt that so many white people need rehab.  This sure didn't happen when black people were the first to be targeted and dropped.

Anyway, so many variables, but the main one is that the money is in rehab.  So there is absolutely 0 incentive for drs to help us.  Especially when they flat out lie and say that they can't.  bleh.

I know about the ableism and absolute hatred that doctors in med school have for us.  My college friend focused on pain medicine because that just blew her mind, how much they hate us, how much of an inconvenience we are, etc, etc.  Hell, if it's like that in med school, well...  

And yes, there is a dr shortage, but we can talk to the AMA for that, because they prevented so many drs from graduating medical school for so many years, and have (and still are) prevented drs from competing, which kept/keep prices artificially high.

ChronicPain,feeuwa2,t1_feetc1j,1579041733.0,"I enjoy edibles and oil (rso) capsules.  Vaping next.  I do like to smoke sometimes, mostly because I'm a former cig smoker, and the smoke just ""feels good"" or whatever.  I had 0 luck w/ kratom, tried all kinds from diff shops, etc.  It helps someone I love when she kicks heroin sometimes, but it just didn't work at all for me.

I was able to lower my pain meds for the short time I had them by using weed.  Kept the dose really low, too, and didn't take them every day.  None of that mattered, tho, that dr dumped all his pain patients at once.  I'm glad I wasn't dependent, or I would've really been sol.

I have talked to dignitas.  They will do it for anyone, as long as they've tried other options, like pain meds.  It's quite expensive, but there have been a couple times when I've added it up, and, well, it would cost less than it would to keep me ""going"" if you can even call it that.

I'm not in such a dark place rn, tho, because I do have my fishes and cat, and, I really didn't care before, but I think more and more about my husband and how much he's helped me, and I hope I can help him as he gets older.  He's about to be 70, but he's in great shape, but... anyway, I can't imagine him being alone, so I don't wanna go to that dark place anymore.  Le sigh.

I hope you get some low pain time today, too.  (i like the way you said that)"

I agree that nobody should be denied care.  And I also agree that different plans are good for different people.

I loved the documentary about Kevorkian.  I remember when he was working, too.  We have dwd here, and there are times I feel like I'd use it if I could, but I'm not terminal.

Weed mostly helps me sleep, and helps with mood and fatigue.  It almost demolishes the pain from fibro for me (1:1 cbd: thc, sativa).  I keep a ton of it in my system for nausea from pain, but I can't be walking around stoned.  I could probably go walk when I'm super high, but I'm afraid I'd injure myself again, so I stick around the house.  So, while I'm glad I'm in a legal state, I'd do much better if I had pain killers.  My past has demonstrated that.  Ah well."

When I first got into audiobooks, I noticed that listening and paying attention seemed to be using a different part of my brain.  It was hard at first, and I'm very happy for the 'rewind' button.  You can set that to go back farther or closer.  Like, I used to have mine to rewind for 30 secs, but as I've gotten better at using that part of my brain, I have it down to 15 secs.  It's still not as easy as watching streaming stuff, or w/e, but audiobooks are so much better quality, ofc.  And more portable."

ChronicPain,feemlrh,t1_feelw2c,1579036817.0,"Yeah, but ""trying everything"" is not something that a lot of us can do.  For example, I've been told to jog.  I can't jog, not in this lifetime.  I can't even walk around the block.  Yoga.  On the floor?  Seriously?  Nope.  So, I've tried massage, PT, OT and chiro, and, while some of that helped with some of the things, I use weed because I can't get proper pain relief.

If I had proper pain relief, I could do some of those things, which would make me in better shape, etc.  So, that's upside down.  Treat the pain, then talk to us about our weight and etc.  That's the humane way to do it, and is what a lot of doctors and other countries agree on."

fishkeeping,fee92uk,t3_eok6aj,1579028923.0,"Nitrite and Ammonia levels should be 0.  I don't think your parameters are so bad that they'd kill your fish, though.  Definitely sounds like a mold of some sort.  I'd use an antifungal after doing a thorough cleaning.  It sounds like it's two different things: fungal illness and overfeeding.  That's what those white floating things could be, or they could be the decaying fish/parts.  But those things could also be from too much detritus at the bottom of the tank, so try to vacuum it if you can.  I use fungus cure by api.

I'd net as much of the white fuzz out, treat them w/ a fungus med and cross your fingers.  Change the water every time the med gives you a chance. 

What else do you have in the tank?  Other fish?  Shrimps?  Plants?  Any new fish   or plants?

They grow slowly, so they won't overgrow your tank too fast.  Once it gets too much for your tank after splitting it, sell some to your local fish group.  That'll be a while, though, like a year lol.

I've done a lot of different floating plants and have had good luck with all.  I keep duckweed and water lettuce mostly now.  I have some guppy grass in some of my smaller tanks (2.5 g and below).  If you get moss, don't touch it.  I had issues with mine turning brown, and that's what it was.  

These are very cute.  They are a BEAST and will outgrow your tank, but you can just trim them and give them to friends or toss them or whatever.  https://meethepet.com/cabomba/  I trim any brown off, and then trim the tops off and replant them.  I have a forest lol.  (if you're in cali, u cannot has, and even if you're not in cali, make sure it doesn't/can't end up in any waterways.  this applies to a lot of plants, esp floating ones).

There are a couple more slim stem plants I have that would look nice in there, but hell if I know what they're called lol.

You can superglue plants to your rocks and if you get wood.  Java moss looks really nice done that way.

Google beginner aquarium plants and you can find a lot of lists with pics.  Just remember that you can't have plants growing out the top, cuz bettas will jump (ppl don't agree, but i had one jump out that i picked up off the floor and brought back to health, so.)"

Tomi Adeyemi's Villians are pretty complex, and the way that the other characters interact with him is also not simple at all. Made me mad as hell.  :)

A good villian is one who makes me mad or feel any other emotion strongly.  With the lazy writing of them so many times, my emotions stay flat, because it's so predictable.  Unless they're evil through and through  AND have seriously interesting devilish things, plans, schemes to perform."
