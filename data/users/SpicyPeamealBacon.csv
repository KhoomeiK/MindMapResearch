Avengers,felvlni,t3_epu5kr,1579232039.0,That's a possibility. I've also heard the rumour that it may be the equivalent of the super serum for captain america (but less potent) which is used on the black widows.

torontoraptors,fefd5et,t3_eouprj,1579053757.0,Agreed. The time off has allowed him to rest and given Ibaka / Boucher more minutes to step up and mesh with the rest of the team. Looking forward to our defense once he returns though!

torontoraptors,feavru0,t3_eoaxet,1578952674.0,I wouldn't mind if our development team took a crack at DSJ. It was only a year ago that people were salivating over his athleticism and potential.

nba,fdtjtto,t3_en1js2,1578717793.0,I'm definitely biased but what he has achieved with this depleted roster while maintaining a high standard of basketball should be applauded. I can't wait to see how the team meshes when they're full strength.

marvelstudios,fc96v0g,t3_egrd2o,1577547968.0,"I thought the Russo Brothers explained they didn't know the extent of her powers when they filmed this because her origin movie hadn't been released yet. You'll see the entire movie all she does is fly and be strong. 

That being said, I do agree the fight scene seemed lackluster with Captain Marvel"
