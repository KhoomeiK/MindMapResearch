I have worked with the homeless, and your description of a homeless population that wants or enjoys *being* homeless is very true.  Mental illness is the biggest driver of long term homelessness, and that requires its own targeted approach.  Short term homelessness is largely an economic problem, but because both issues are ""homelessness"" they get grouped together and the ""fixes"" are piss poor attempts to kill two birds with one stone.  Permanent housing would help drive down and possibly eliminate short term homelessness, which would then allow us to take a look at more precise fixes for long term homelessness."
