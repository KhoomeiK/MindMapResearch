thesopranos,ff6ufad,t3_erzftv,1579635099.0,"""Wheel in the Sky keeps on turning!"""
HondaElement,ff42y4t,t1_fevr5fy,1579554395.0,I just bought the part for a hundred and ten bucks and my mechanic is going to replace it this week.
sysadmin,ff42vmd,t1_ff41g3a,1579554351.0,I'll check. I've tried everything that was suggested in this thread that I didn't already try but I'm still having the issue. I have several servers in the console but they won't report status.
Windows10,ferqg5x,t1_feoyxbr,1579357172.0,Then how did I download it from there yesterday?
Windows10,feoyxbr,t3_eq8u87,1579308413.0,It's available in the MS Store.
Surface,feovfdq,t3_eq8d4y,1579306257.0,Welcome to your life.
NintendoSwitch,fenoq2k,t3_eq4sbr,1579288703.0,It's fantastic. Get it!!
sysadmin,fencppp,t1_femw0e4,1579281877.0,Ok
NintendoSwitch,femve0g,t3_epq5yd,1579270622.0,"That's because the Switch is a killer gaming device. I have the mini and being able to play portable versions of Jedi Outcast, Doom 3, and Skyrim is an amazing thing. Would love to see more ports."
sysadmin,femqf4q,t1_felwy8y,1579266567.0,No error. Just an info box that the compute hasn't reported status.
StarWars,felavw6,t1_fekzr1y,1579217887.0,Exactly as it should be.
sysadmin,fel5bza,t1_fel0zso,1579214389.0,Thanks. I'll try that.
sysadmin,fel5att,t1_fekf777,1579214370.0,Yes.
sysadmin,fel53gl,t1_feki810,1579214245.0,That kit is only for 32-bit OS.
sysadmin,fel5211,t1_fekipam,1579214220.0,"The machine are showing up in wsus. They aren't reporting their status to wsus, so it doesn't know what updates they have/need."
sysadmin,fel3x58,t1_fel2b34,1579213523.0,"Ah, I believe but I will check."
sysadmin,fekz0yj,t1_fekmaac,1579210554.0,"Yes. The DCs are connected and on WSUS. But they aren't reporting status, so the wsus server doesn't know what updates they need. I verified that the group policy is applying correctly. I've checked to make sure that the settings are in the registry from the group policy."
husky,fek3wcf,t3_epcpau,1579192068.0,"I have a 5 month old Husky who is starting to pull a lot during walks. Is anyone taking their Husky out on bike or cart? If so, please share some details. I want to let her do what she's bred to do, but I don't want to get myself killed in the process."
rush,fek3h8j,t3_eotjgb,1579191814.0,"All I keep thinking about, and I know Neil wouldn't care, but the stinking Grammy's had better give Neil more than just an image and birth/death year. Like, I want to see Dave Grohl and Mike Portnoy on stage with Getty and Alex to give that man a proper tribute."
legostarwars,fegvffg,t3_ep3rk0,1579103414.0,Love it!
dogs,fef40kt,t1_fee30fa,1579047653.0,Where do you get necks and backs? Regular butcher?
legostarwars,fedt70g,t3_eonizo,1579019369.0,Combat Speeder for my favorite new character.
dogs,fea2ajy,t1_fe4ettt,1578943643.0,OMG!!! I LITERALLY JUST THOUGHT THAT!! POUNDVOTES!! MAKE IT SO!!
rush,fe5zbqy,t3_envvkr,1578878293.0,Yup. Neil fans are everywhere.
NintendoSwitch,fe5z92h,t3_envwy4,1578878247.0,Absolutely fantastic. Best port I've played on the switch.
StarWars,fe5z5n4,t3_enw2f8,1578878186.0,Play the Dark Forces games. You won't regret it.
StarWars,fe5z46w,t1_fe5tslx,1578878162.0,Great trilogy.
legostarwars,fdw522e,t3_en0c7x,1578755157.0,Wow.
thesopranos,fdo7q4j,t3_emab5f,1578600346.0,So is this a movie or series?
legostarwars,fdnlnkv,t3_emc78s,1578588387.0,That would be awesome.
thesopranos,fdn7ewj,t3_elyd9p,1578579327.0,"If you have a problem with this sub, I suggest you check out the Law & Order: The SUV Reddit."
StarWars,fdlmzs6,t3_em13af,1578527703.0,He will absolutely be in it. I'd be shocked of they left him out.
legostarwars,fdi0s4a,t1_fdhv7yy,1578433694.0,So cool!!
legostarwars,fdhm9gd,t1_fdhfb7i,1578425645.0,What parts were used to make Kyle?
legostarwars,fdhevbe,t1_fdhebxw,1578421170.0,So they released a Kyle Katarn set???
StarWars,fdh7lrq,t3_ele39o,1578417116.0,Disney and JJ could not have asked for a better female Jedi than Rey. She's unbelievably cute and badass at the same time.
legostarwars,fdh7cku,t3_ele79m,1578416959.0,Love it! Was that an official minifig or MOC?
StarWars,fdh6udp,t3_ele80a,1578416643.0,"Honestly, the new book canon stories are kind of meh. Nothing really unexpected happens since all the major players exist in the movies. I actually enjoy the Legends books. The Thrawn trilogy is great. I'm now reading another trilogy from Timothy Zahn. There's also a great book called ""Plaguis,"" which I don't believe is canon, but really should be."
bernesemountaindogs,fdgoc9l,t1_fdgo7q2,1578403895.0,"Yea, my dog seemed to be fine for the first 8 years, but she was slowed down a lot lately. My vet specifically told me to get her off grain-free, so we'll see."
bernesemountaindogs,fdgo1r7,t1_fdgny4n,1578403649.0,"Yup. Makes you wonder, right?"
bernesemountaindogs,fdgm3vq,t3_chn0iq,1578401919.0,"I've had my dog on TOTW her whole life. She's 10 now and we've been concerned that she seems to have slowed down significantly over the last two years. Obviously she's no spring chicken, but the change has been noticed for a while. I'm in the process of switching her over to a premium food that contains grain to see if she improves; if not, we may get her in for some tests."
Surface,fcy772c,t3_ej99bu,1578075806.0,Download Steam and then buy Jedi Outcast. Great old game that runs great on the Surface.
legostarwars,fcy6stb,t3_ejfvvv,1578075617.0,So your resolution is what? To buy $700 Lego sets?? HA!! Enjoy!!
HondaElement,fcw5n30,t1_fcvgoiz,1578017716.0,Stopped making them in 2011. Bummer.
dogs,fcw5k86,t1_fcw4jo0,1578017663.0,The problem is that it's like 10ml of the stuff. That's probably a bunch of slices of ham.
dogs,fcw5fbf,t1_fcw57gu,1578017570.0,"Tonight I held a treat in front of her and slowly moved it towards her. When her mouth opened, I was able to get the meds in her mouth."
dogs,fcvmu1l,t1_fcvhbg3,1578005493.0,Complete freak out and won't stay still even if restrained. She's been a sick puppy since day 1. She hates the vet and so I think that has a lot to do with it.
dogs,fcv6sg0,t1_fcv69o6,1577995826.0,She's not having the syringe. Yesterday we missed almost the whole dose.
dogs,fcv3zcz,t1_fcv3szt,1577994168.0,Okay. I'll try the pill pockets.
gsuite,fcuygiz,t1_fcurf5g,1577991036.0,Worked! Thanks!
ccna,fcuag36,t3_eiwcy1,1577976396.0,What is the major change in exams?
HondaElement,fcuaa2h,t3_eitulh,1577976278.0,"2008 - 151K and still chugging along. Honestly, the Element being your first car ever will probably kill all future cars that you own. It's the most versatile vehicle I've ever owned. Enjoy!"
StarWars,fcq50j8,t1_fcq37p4,1577878840.0,I have the same combination on my luggage!
legostarwars,fckud96,t3_ehpt83,1577733384.0,"Hope you don't have any financial plans, because they're all going to get shot to hell."
legostarwars,fcktylr,t3_ehqdvp,1577733133.0,That Ghost is a beaut!
Parenting,fck8yew,t1_fck41s4,1577719808.0,Tough ages. Mine is 7 and she is still tough. Wants constant attention from us.
legostarwars,fck5mza,t3_ehfol0,1577717278.0,"It was probably the most challenging set that I've put together. It's also my favorite SW ship, so I really enjoyed it."
legostarwars,fck5abo,t3_ehcmp5,1577716994.0,Great set though. Neat build.
legostarwars,fck4237,t3_ehfiwj,1577715971.0,Woa!!!!!!!!!!
Parenting,fck3z8y,t3_ehml1m,1577715904.0,How old are the kids?

legostarwars,fchpt9z,t1_fchdfic,1577652824.0,"I have to admit, the Elsa jewelry box is pretty sweet. It opens using gears."
legostarwars,fch8li4,t3_eh8gb1,1577648256.0,Great price for a classic ship and the set itself is great.
legostarwars,fch7kyj,t3_eh6ppu,1577648009.0,"The only critique I'd have is that it looks too pretty. I'd use more gray and dark colors and even some dark tan to give it a beat up look. Other than that, it's fantastic."
StarWars,fc994t7,t1_fc98pji,1577549021.0,"I'm still bummed about the end for him. I would have liked to have seen more ""Ben."""
StarWars,fc8x53t,t3_egraml,1577543499.0,I love mine. Made a stand for it too.
StarWars,fc6y7as,t3_egjaii,1577492554.0,How was it? Mine is waiting to be built. I savor it though. Usually a bag per night.
StarWars,fc3sxrz,t1_fc1sva0,1577397818.0,I guess you didn't see it because your mind was already made up. Right?
legostarwars,fc3stdt,t1_fc1zc1f,1577397727.0,Love it!!!!
StarWars,fc2ko3x,t3_efuquc,1577365012.0,They retired it from Star Wars.
StarWars,fbzrdlu,t1_fbzqkpl,1577257631.0,TNG is a fantastic series.
StarWars,fbwaol0,t3_eeshok,1577144964.0,"So you don't care what people think, yet you post a review that is open for comments."
sysadmin,fbkq4g1,t3_edab5s,1576954033.0,Appreciate all the feedback.
