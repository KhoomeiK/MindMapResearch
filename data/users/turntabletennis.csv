The first thing you linked, is to a debunked estimate on death toll numbers from 2008.

I'm not going to sit here and debunk every conflated thing you say. You are misconstruing numbers around and not watching what you say. You said the mustard gas killed 1 million people, it didn't.

The Iraq and Afghanistan wars have caused around [500,000 deaths](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-many-people-have-been-killed-in-iraq-and-afghanistan), NOT a million, dipshit.

The Iranians are definitely not going to assassinate politicians from almost 20 years ago to make a point either, that's fucking retarded. They would assassinate current political figures, IF THEY COULD GET PAST THE WORLDS BEST DEFENSES, OR EVEN SO MUCH AS GET AN ARMED DRONE PAST OUR MAVY SHIPS IN THE OCEAN. The US's defense systems are second to none.

And mustard gas? Saddam Hussein's entire genocide against the Kurds resulted in [less than 200,000 deaths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Saddam_Hussein%27s_Iraq#Number_of_victims). The Iran-Iraq war resulted in around [500,000 deaths on both sides](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War). The mustard gas attack resulted in [up to 5,000 deaths, and 10,000 injuries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halabja_chemical_attack), not a MiLlIoN DeAD. You tool. In total, along with NERVE GASES, [Saddam killed more like 100,000 people, and injured 80,000 using chemical weapons.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_chemical_attacks_against_Iran). But it wasn't all mustard gas, which is far less deadly. Again, not 1 mIlLiOn DeAd!!11

And [Rumsfeld didn't sell mustard gas, he made it politically possible for Saddam's administration to buy chemicals necessary to make them](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-153210/Rumsfeld-helped-Iraq-chemical-weapons.html). They weren't fully produced weapons. Rumsfeld is a fucking snake, and not by any means considered a patriot by me, and he is guilty of aiding Saddam at the benefit of himself and his corrupt administration.
