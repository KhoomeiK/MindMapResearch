Recorder,fe5vrol,t1_fe5m8pu,1578876039.0,"Traditionnaly, the recorders don't transpose. It's the same set  of fingerings moreso, but instead transposing you learn to play always in C, so different fingerings! It's actually very interesting. I played the soprano some weeks, until I was at ease with The 2 first octaves in C, F and G Major. Then I learned the alto for some weeks, idem. After I can work the two. I prefer the alto too!"
Recorder,fe5f1e6,t3_enu6mc,1578868672.0,"I'm a flute player too, and I play the recorder for some barock sonatas. Go for it, air management is the same, since the two instruments belong to the same family. Reeds are different. You need to learn a set of fingerings for soprano, and another one for the alto. I learned step by step, using the Mönkemeyer method. Lots of scales, arppegios. You will progress quite fast I think, in weeks."
