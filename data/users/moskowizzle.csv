sousvide,fdip28m,t1_fdio80e,1578447848.0,"Really, really shouldn't be searing on high heat like that in a non-stick pan. Avocado oil has a smoke point around 520 degrees, which is well above the temp that Teflon begins to breakdown. Other non-stick surfaces may have higher limits, but this type of searing should really be limited to cast iron or stainless steel.

You can get a totally legit cast iron pan for around $20. You'll get a way better result and it's much more versatile than a standard non-stick pan. Also, assuming you take care of it, cast iron is non-stick!"
sousvide,fdi1uqa,t1_fdi1iun,1578434240.0,"Cast iron. I have an electric range and just turn it up all the way. Biggest mistake I see with people using cast iron, especially on electric, is that they just don't let it get hot enough before using it."
sousvide,fdi1ak2,t1_fdi0x5d,1578433969.0,Quickly! Basting is probably a minute or so on each side. Noticable smoke doesn't really happen until I'm just about done or even a bit after when the screaming hot pan is just sitting there with the leftover butter/oil in it.
