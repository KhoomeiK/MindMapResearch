Also I don't think we should exclude that once the person is incapacitated you are still obligated to call 911 if you are physically able to do so. Shooting someone and then waiting to call an ambulance because the person you shot just tried to break in isn't a justifiable reason to simply let that person suffer x amount of minutes while you hesitate or even stall to call for help.
conspiracy,fdladw0,t1_fdl9ma4,1578519828.0,"I'm not saying a plane definitely hit a pentagon, I'm just saying in my opinion it would be more difficult to fake a plane existing than there to have been a real plane with real people involved somehow. For me, it makes it a tragedy that those people died and their families don't know the truth and their lives were used as props in the official narrative."

conspiracy,fdl1lav,t1_fdkyefx,1578515460.0,"I'm just saying it would be very complicated to say it was a plane with passengers when no plane existed. You'd have to invent the passengers, their families, and maintain that story for the news. You'd also need the pilots, the flight crew, the flight logs, the flight number. Planes are on schedules and they fly regularly, so what regular flight was it? It can't just be an impromptu flight. I don't remember what flight it was but say it was the 8am to miami out of newark, what if you were actually on the 8 am to miami out newark but you know you didn't crash into the pentagon? That's not gonna work. 

So essentially in my opinion a real plane was involved and real innocent people did die, because with how our commercial air travel works I don't know how they would be able to magically pull a flight out of thin air with even the basic details to give to the media."

You realize that's how fast planes normally climb when you take off on a commercial flight? Just read an article about the plane that crashed in Iran and it climbed to 8,000 in just under 2 min, it was trying to reach its cruising altitude of 10,000 feet.
