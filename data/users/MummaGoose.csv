tippytaps,ffpf3is,t1_ffov03t,1580093472.0,It’s very common in Australia given we have an overpopulation and because they eat a natural diet (they aren’t raised to kill) their meat is digested more easily by my boy. I’m sure that you recognise the term “game”.
tippytaps,ffopt6g,t1_ffnerb9,1580080294.0,Yes! This. They seem to carry a lot of extra skin around.
tippytaps,ffopk2l,t1_ffnfldj,1580080203.0,"WE DO NOT FEED MAX PPL FOOD - his farts are atrocious if we do! He isn’t overweight but he sure is heavy! He’s just a big boy. He’s a lab cross (idk what he’s crossed with) honestly if my farts smelled like that, my tummy wouldn’t feel very comfortable so I banned ppl food very early on in owning him. He has to have a kangaroo based kibble and that’s it!"
tippytaps,ffoonid,t1_ffnmcym,1580079999.0,I was just reading through the “they are overweight” bs and thinking “I wonder if these ppl have ever seen a lab with a thick coat before?” They are fine! Don’t even worry. People obv don’t realise that every breed looks different! A little husk at Cocoa’s age is natural too because she can’t move around as well.
MasterReturns,ffokl55,t3_es0004,1580078610.0,Oh I love her coat. I had a cat with the same one as a child. They aren’t very common. Her name was Freckles.
MasterReturns,ffoka73,t1_ffojetp,1580078490.0,"Yeah, it’s not hugely common in dogs, more in cats. But it does happen. It’s been hard to toilet train her because of it but we are practically all good now. At least she’s small so the poops aren’t giant! Lol"
MasterReturns,ffoj658,t1_ffoj19g,1580078221.0,Gives you such a shock haha
MasterReturns,ffoiywz,t1_ffoi47c,1580078145.0,Oh thank goodness. Good boy. My mums tiny girl has incontinence. Sometimes when a female is small and they spay them they can accidentally damage the little sphincter. Because she’s little this happened to her. She’s 7 now and she’s been on and off medication to stop leaking which burns her urethra. But it’s okay now she just sometimes can’t hold it in when we are out so I find a puddle on my rug. But I never get mad because we know it’s not her fault.
