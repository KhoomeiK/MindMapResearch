Australia's model is pretty much perfect. It's quite easy to get a gun, really, so long as you have a legitimate reason.
Farmers, hunters, and sport shooters can all get the types of guns that they need for what they do.
No automatic weapons (nor de facto automatic weapons like you get with those bumper attachments),
I don't think semi-automatics are typically allowed either.
Collectors can get licenses to collect guns that might otherwise not be allowed.

And, of course, you have to store your guns securely. No hiding them under the bed or leaving them in your car.
A secure gun safe makes it so that would-be thieves can't easily get their hands on your weapon.

That's what reasonable gun legislation looks like."

Criminals very rarely use guns. They're not exactly hard to get (quite easy, actually, if you have a legitimate reason),

and they have to put in much more effort to get them if it's a longer-planned thing. Most don't."

Then we can make sure that those who *do* do it are as unsafe as possible thanks to reduced awareness, and that traffic conditions are as bad as we can make them, since fewer bikes means more cars!"
Showerthoughts,ff5dj3j,t1_ff3sibx,1579588368.0,"Stop signs are a special case. In many places there's an actual law allowing cyclists to treat them as Give Way signs, and this is absolutely how it should always be. Cyclists have much better vision when approaching an intersection than other road users, as well as much more difficulty starting back up if they do stop.

As for red lights, 90% of the time I agree, there's no excuse. 10% of the time it's because the damn lights won't cycle unless they detect a vehicle waiting, and they don't detect bikes.

However, I think you are underestimating the amount of law-breaking cars do on a daily basis. Far, far more than cyclists do. First, there's running red lights. Rare for a car to blow through a long red light, I'll grant you, but the number of people who speed up to make it through on a yellow, neglecting the fact that legally yellow means you **have to stop** if it's safe to do so. Let alone the number of people who clearly *didn't* make it through before it turned red, anyway.

Speaking of accelerating to make it through, how about speeding. In some areas it seems more people are speeding than not. This is a far more serious crime (in terms of potential scale of the impact done to others) than anything cyclists do, and yet it is treated as completely normal even by otherwise law-abiding people.

And I could rant for ages about things like not using blinkers, using them in unhelpful ways, dangerously swerving in and out of lanes, tailgating, etc. All things that most people dismiss.

And that last bit is really my point. People so often make the claim, like you did here, that cyclists are these horrid fiends constantly breaking road rules. But they just dismiss or fail to notice the huge number of infractions drivers do on a daily basis. Maybe at worst they see some of them and dismiss it as that guy being a duck, but they certainly never make the same generalisation that they do towards cyclists."

todayilearned,ff4uorv,t1_ff4q826,1579572875.0,"A cricketer can get out (and therefore have their wicket fall) in a few different ways. These are the main ones.

Caught out, just like in baseball.

Run out, where a fielder throws the ball at the wicket while they are running (sort of like a run-out in baseball).

Bowled, where the bowler (cricket's equivalent to the pitcher) bowls it such that the batsman misses and the ball hits the wicket.

LBW, or leg before wicket, where (to simplify it a bit, because it's actually insanely complicated even to a fan of the sport) the batsman *would* have been bowled, except his leg got in the way and stopped it. So you have to *hit* the ball with your bat, not use your body as a shield.

Off the top of my head, I think it's happened twice in the history of test cricket?

Cricket is a rare case where the two words are not synonymous.
A tie is if, at the end of two innings each, the scores are tied.
Usually because the scores were tied, and then the 10th wicket fell before he could score one more run required to win.

A draw is if the 5th day ends and no decision has been reached. The batting team could be 400 runs behind,
but if the team that's bowling can't take the wickets to end their innings, the match ends in a draw.
These days, you usually only get draws if there has been *substantial* disruption of play due to weather.
If it rains, they stop play, so a lot of rain can reduce the amount of actual time on field, but it doesn't change
the fact that the game ends 5 days after it started (or was scheduled to start, if rain delays the start of the first day)."

The passwords are of length 4, with a character set of 2000, for 2000 common ""words"".

He compares it to a system that uses a single word with 1337 substitutions plus a single number and symbol,
but most people tend to interpret it as being compared to an 11 character (or worse, a ""very long"") pseudo-randomly
generated password. That leads people to think it's a much better system than it is.
It's a good system, but not a *great* one."
LifeProTips,fe6gwa6,t1_fe3m2l4,1578890530.0,"What Randall is comparing in the comic is ""one common word with 1337 substitutions, an initial capital, a number, 
and a symbol at the end. Number and symbol may be swapped"". He is **not** comparing four words to 11 random chars, 
as your comment seems to imply.

Even then, Randall's advice is good only if the words are truly randomly chosen. 
Most people who use this method without care will pick something relatively easy to shorten. 
Randall's maths assumes four words randomly selected out of 2000. 
But if you actually draw from a vocabulary of more like 500, 
with maybe one extra rare word from a larger vocab, your security is drastically reduced.
Even more so if you end up doing something like three adjectives and a noun, or adjective-noun-adjective-noun.

Even in the best-case scenario, Randall's method should really only be used for passwords that absolutely
**must** be memorised. The best thing to do is an equivalent-lengthed truly pseudo-random string.
20&ndash;40 random characters is a much better password than four words. His method gives 2000^4 possibilities,
which is 10^(13).   
Choosing from 90 characters (fewer than are available on the standard US keyboard), you need only 7 characters
to be better than that. 
If you do best practice and use a random character generator to get a 20 character password 
(go even longer to be even better!) you get 10^39 possibilities. 

For passwords that must be manually remembered, it's a decent system. 
But make sure to use a random word generator. 
And add some numbers and symbols in between the words or at the end, 
because that can only help. 
Alternatively, do something like think of a lengthy phrase that's easy for you to remember 
but others wouldn't think to associate with you (or with it being a common phrase) 
and then find a way to abbreviate it while including numbers/symbols in it."
