They drove around the neighborhood and saw that giant tv box you put out on trash day,  or one of them saw you take out a bunch of cash at the bank, or that neighbor you got in a fight with told some shady guys as revenge you keep lots of cash around, or guys of questionable character saw your wife in public, thought she looked good and followed her home.

The possibilities are endless.  Bad things can happen in any neighborhood because bad people dont tend to just stay in bad ones.  The phrase ""these things never happen here"" gets reported on the news and its little consolation for the people it happened to, assuming they still exist."

Cisco,ff6bmbd,t1_ff67m76,1579623637.0,"Yeah, it is supposed to be our authentication server for everything but apps( they use ADFS).  If I have to light up any other server to make it do what I want, then why wouldnt I just go with that product and eliminate a costly license?  

My other annoyance with ISE has always been cost, and licensing bait and switch.

They originally were pretty expensive for the first few versions, but decent.  Later on with the new licensing model they have gone up significantly in cost.  Also annoyed that we bought an unlimited device license for using TACACS+ which Cisco then decided translated to a 50 device license in the new version.     The PAK literally says unlimited device license.  50 is a limit if I am not mistaken."

Like you I also have a Mark IV that goes longer shot for shot with the same ammo.  Then again, my Mark II has probably 30k rounds through it more than the IV, so wear is probably a factor."
Cisco,ff59bi4,t1_ff4u7uo,1579584126.0,"I have worked with both, and in it we know there are plenty of ways of doing things, some better and some not thr most ideal.  I find whenever i am trying to do something with ISE that is not exactly how cisco envisioned things, that I run into issues.  Usually I will have some ideal way I would like to do things, and end up falling back to a more hacked alternate way because the thing I want to do is not supported the way I want to do it.  

My biggest annoyance so far is that PEAP over LDAP is not supported.  I try the same things on Clearpass, and suprise they work the way I want.  If Cisco ends up supporting it, it is generally years later after Clearpass already added it.  PEAP support over LDAP for instance has been supported there for years, where Cisco has equally old entries on the forums of people asking for it.  

In our case we have a network of other entities that all allow each other authenticated guest access, since our staff all go back and forth, and those networks share some resources normal guest access doesnt.  Printers, file access, things like that.  So it is very important for us to have secure ways of access, with preferably the same ssid for ease of use.  Likewise it is very important whatever we use is encrypted, but segregated, so some methods are less ideal.  We always have a much easier time setting it up when I see them running Clearpass vs. ISE.  Sometimes days of extra work and TAC cases."
guns,ff4q89n,t1_ff4o91n,1579569820.0,"Well yeah, the cycling issues are my main problem.  After around 500 rounds or so my Papoose will start having issues extracting, or the firing pin channel will get gummed up causing light strikes, but that happens usually much higher in the round count."
Cisco,ff4j51b,t1_ff4i4rg,1579564858.0,"I guess that is true to an extent, however they generally take the cake for this specific product.

Cisco,ff4hq9y,t1_ff42b4m,1579563897.0,"The time to commit thing is very misleading.  The general time to commit using Panorama in our production environment is always less than 60 seconds, where our FTD demo box which isn't even doing anything heavy is ~5 minutes.

Cisco also has a particular way of promising every next patch is going to fix everything under the sun, all the while actually fixing only 1 or two issues correctly and introducing a whole pile more issues.  At least when it comes to Firepower and to an extent ISE.

Cisco,ff4fcr2,t1_ff3svbc,1579562269.0,"ISE is great, and does many things from an authentication standpoint.  We even have it tied into our Palos to forward wireless auth to them for filtering for devices that do not forward NTLM data correctly (cough MacOS, iOS)

Randomly turning off the keyboard and touchpad, or the touchscreen going haywire.

I will say that the i7 you can get with them is one of the best mobile processors you can get at the moment, and the machine can handle quite a bit.  The only downside is the lack of a discrete graphics card.  I think you can get an external thunderbolt enclosure for that though.  Otherwise, an amazong laptop.

This system is merely ok.  One big loop really doesnt make you feel like you are actually exploring anything.  When you actually are exploring it is slow and plodding and take the fun out of it.  

In X3, you felt the thrill of exploration when you found and entered a new gate.  Suddenly you were in a new land giving you an install feeling of exploration, followed by a more gradual one when you actually explored the system.  

In X4 it's like, well, there looks like there is something cool over there, so I'm going to hop in this ring for awhile, then slowly fly out to it.  Although, im not really all that excited, because I can already see most of it from here.

On shady companies packaging, they will list max speed with optimal packet size and all other features disabled.  A speed which you are unlikely to achieve in real use.
