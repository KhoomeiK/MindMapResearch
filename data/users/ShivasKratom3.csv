This isn’t there to trip it’s there for small amounts anyone getting fucked up is obviously not being smart and taking the amount the average user does. Just like booze you can take too much, OD, and have a bad night but that doesn’t happen to the average drinking who knows how much to take. Don’t be on meds rhat contradict and don’t have actual medical conditions that would stop one from taking drugs, usually I consider this obvious. No one should be taking 20g of this shit

So essentially it’s as dangerous as any other thing you can misuse but in common usage it’s fine. Breaking news don’t take random shit without knowledge and don’t over do drugs.
