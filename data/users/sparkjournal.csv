godtiersuperpowers,fe3omr7,t1_fe3lk2d,1578851390.0,"_\*whistles\*_ Hoo boy, how to summarize it succinctly...

Worm is a super long (like 1.7 million words) web serial written by John McCrae (u/Wildbow) that deconstructs the whole superhero genre. You can [read the whole thing for free online.](https://parahumans.wordpress.com)

It follows a teenage girl who has the power to control (and sense through) all bugs within a few blocks of herself, which sounds like a stupid power but she uses it to tremendous effect against enemies she should have no business fighting against. The story gets *very* dark and there's some body-horror stuff throughout, so you should know that going in.

Eidolon is a mega-powerful hero in this universe who has the ability to summon *any* three powers as the situation requires. [Here's a fanart of him.](https://i.imgur.com/14XJAIa.jpg)

If you ever read the whole story, feel free to come over to r/Parahumans and nerd out about it with the rest of us! I don't advise diving into discussions there until then though, because spoilers abound. The sequel, Ward, is currently ongoing, so that's what a lot of people there are discussing at the moment and you wouldn't want to ruin Worm for yourself that way."

I can't say much about why that is without spoiling parts you haven't read yet, but if you're caught up on Ward, you'll catch those things as you go along. If you're reading Twig *before* starting Ward, then I suppose you might spot the similarites the other way 'round."
