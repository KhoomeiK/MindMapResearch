xxfitness,ffgbqdp,t3_ete86h,1579902728.0,A workout should not leave you feeling that fatigued (with the exception of some endurance sports like marathon running or a triathlon). Are you doing too much?  Not just in the gym but in life too - pushing yourself to the brink of complete exhausting will NOT make you healthier.

politics,fdhlsyv,t1_fdhj3za,1578425367.0,"I don't have the exact knowledge to help you understand, but part of the problem is this mentality. The system we currently have does not work, and only serves to deepen the rift between the poor and the ultra-wealthy, which in effect, makes you work harder to achieve the type of retirement you are hoping for because you can't afford to retire AND have a life that includes vacations or purchasing new items, even potentially at your own detriment, because the cost continues to rise but your income stays the same. 

Again, I am not fully explaining why or how exactly, but part of the problem is the system currently requires us to work so hard and so long because it's not sustainable for the working class."

xxfitness,fc65h5o,t3_egetp1,1577472716.0,"To be fair, the Smith machine can cause problems if you don't have excellent form and you are attempting certain exercises. 

I know it's not for everyone, but the way I would approach it is go back to the gym, find the same staff member, and ask him for suggestions on form or alternative machines. Sometimes, a Smith machine isn't necessary. If you take control and make this an opportunity for growth and action instead of feeling like your confidence has been damaged, you are actually sending a stronger message that you're in this for the long haul and you want to learn. I've found that people are much more receptive to that and can often be a bigger help if you acknowledge their perspective and ask for feedback.

You got this, lady!"
