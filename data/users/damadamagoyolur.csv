1. They weren't saying all people in MO are blatantly terrible homphobes and racists, so you didn't really need to defend them. 
2. Even if they did mean that about people in MO your statement doesn't refute theirs (nor vice versa). 
3. Allow for the possibility that you haven't been paying attention or noticed racism or homophobia, possibly because it was never directed at you because you're possibly not gay or not a person of color.
