It was impressive for the time, at least within the tail end of the first year or two . If I remember correctly newegg.com was still destroying at that time. Amazon started putting out competitive prices and I have never turned back. It's very common to not turn profits for years when growing a business. Very rare for any company to be profitable within the first 2 years never-mind a company attacking something like the online marketplace before people were even considering that as a shopping outlet. All done from 300k, god damn"

todayilearned,ff5ykze,t1_ff5wigq,1579614416.0,I think technology and the way society is structured takes away our instinctual element of being a part of a clan/group of people. We are supposed to depend on each other for survival but we live in a world where it's everyone for themselves. Something we were never evolved to do.

It's not necessarily a bad thing to become bored of a hobby and jump to the next and repeat. It's just not congruent with how our society functions.

I guess bumping into my current g/f while looking for art supplies was a mistake, I should of got totally inside my own head and convinced myself not to say anything, like you. 

Also the fucking irony of saying ""PEOPLE CAN GET MARRIED ON TINDER HURR"" then not being able to see the hypocrisy and not believing randomly running into people naturally and talking to them won't lead to anything. You sir, are stunted."

As far as hitting on employees, oof I should clarify that is almost always creepy since they need to be nice. I find it obvious when a girl is approachable or not when shopping. I guess if you're creepy/awkward then it would be creepy.

You literally have a WAY better chance approaching the cutie at the store, she can see who you are rather than scrolling through 1000s of other dudes."

""Getting a boner from complaining"" Maybe it's a cry out to see if other people also see things for what they are. Judging by the gold I was given, the answer is clearly yes. A lucid perspective is rare and it's pretty lonely when you're in a low percentage of like-minded individuals."

It took me over a year to get the cat to trust me (don't live with my mom) recently Ive taken ownership because the cat needs daily insulin shots. She will often approach me for pets and after a few seconds she gets upset and growls. Then it's like that moment never happened. She wants more pets and the cycle continues. It's like she can't kick the instinct. Is this normal for cats or could she have been a feral? (She purrs the entire time)
