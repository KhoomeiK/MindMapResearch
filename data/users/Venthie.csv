EstrangedAdultChild,ffdv58f,t3_estrni,1579829705.0,"You have my deepest sympathy, that's a very rough spot that you're in.

No one can tell you how you're supposed to feel right now. I've told myself for years that when my mom finally dies that it will be a huge relief...but I know realistically I'll initially feel a lot of guilt. I'll look back at the happy memories, and that'll just make it hurt worse because for every good memory, there were 20 bad ones, and I watched her slowly kill herself for decades with chain smoking, alcoholism, and generally just being a bitter person. 

Just try and remind yourself what led you to going NC in the first place, as much anger as that may bring...it's okay to feel things, especially right now. 

In my case, I'm an only child that still feels a lot of guilt for going NC since I sometimes feel like I've abandoned my mom. But I remind myself that I did try, I tried to help. I tried to offer advice, I tried to be there. But the toxic relationship wasn't worth it. It wasn't worth feeling even worse every time I talked to her. It wasn't worth the drama. And she'd never take any of my advice or words seriously. It wasn't what she wanted to hear, so I stopped. SHE pushed me away, SHE pushed my family away, SHE made these choices and she can suffer in the consequences of them while I continue to live my life."
AmItheAsshole,ff7unf2,t1_ff7uepo,1579658770.0,"Yes previous messages sent were read before we realized my mom was logging in. My mom has a history of snooping through social media, she used to create fake accounts & would add family members that cut her out."
AmItheAsshole,ff6ytcs,t1_ff6unzk,1579637685.0,"It locks the account but memorializes it, so no one can login but you can still tag them, see pictures/posts, etc."
AmItheAsshole,ff6yd9h,t1_ff6xtjj,1579637423.0,"She was not posting anything. She logged into Facebook using my grandma's email and password, so grandma would show up as online in Facebook messenger. This means she also had access to all of my grandma's private messages."
AmItheAsshole,ff6j3ja,t1_ff6izk4,1579628287.0,"She can still access the pictures and profile, but she can't login anymore. The only access she lost was private messages."
AmItheAsshole,ff6fnyu,t1_ff6fe5e,1579626173.0,I think that's what a lot of people are misunderstanding here. My mom was signing in AS her. The page is still active and the pictures are still there. My Mom can just no longer login AS her.
AmItheAsshole,ff67ti5,t1_ff67hjt,1579621182.0,"Yes, I've stated in my post and reply that I asked what she was doing on the account. She told me it was none of my business what she was using the account for and that she didn't have to justify her actions. I told her politely that it was upsetting my cousins and I, she changed the subject and refused to discuss it further. This was around Christmas. 
She is also an alcoholic, so even if I say something politely it doesn't do much good. She only hears what she wants to hear."
AmItheAsshole,ff66z53,t1_ff65aw1,1579620616.0,"The account isn't removed, it's memorialized, she just can't login to it. My grandma passed in September, she's has plenty of time to gather pictures or messages. I've confronted her about it before & she could not give me a reason why she was doing it. I even expressed that it's upsetting other family members as well."
AmItheAsshole,ff63c8n,t1_ff61sv8,1579618096.0,"There was discussion. I had asked her before shutting it down why she was logging into it in the first place and also mentioned that it upset my cousins and me. The account is still memorialized, she just can't login anymore."
AmItheAsshole,ff5yoiu,t1_ff5xdly,1579614498.0,"Thank you so much. I've actually gone to a few Al-Anon meetings...a little too ""spiritual"" for my taste but it was really reassuring to know I'm not alone and hear the validation that my mom is in fact an alcoholic whether she admits it or not.
I'm also in therapy which has been extremely helpful. Unfortunately since my mom refuses to admit she has a problem & refuses to seek outside help, my only option is no-contact. I've tried everything to get it through to her that she has a problem."
AmItheAsshole,ff5uxqy,t1_ff5tl8t,1579611127.0,"Thank you, it has been rough. I lost my dad, then my grandma, and honestly feel like I've lost my mom too. There's no getting through to her anymore. Thankfully my husband's family has been there for me through it all."
AmItheAsshole,ff5uuu2,t1_ff5tlj1,1579611047.0,"There's a possibility this was grieving for her...but it was also hurting others. I tried to give her some great books on dealing with loss recommended to me by a friend for Christmas, she never thanked me for them or acknowledged them. I had a mutual friend try to bring up therapy again...she wasn't having it. She doesn't seem interested in actually moving on or getting help with it."
RBNChildcare,fempuk8,t1_fembzaq,1579266048.0,"Oh man, best of luck to you! Hopefully your future in-laws are understanding and supportive, it's made a huge difference for me keeping them in the loop. And congratulations!"
RBNChildcare,felurax,t1_felsymh,1579231435.0,"It was me, my mom and my dad...but my dad had his own business & worked all day, then worked more once he got home..he hid in his office which upset me a lot growing up but as I got older I understood where it was coming from. They were married but had a weird relationship. So it was really just my mom & I 90% of the time. Growing up she always paraded me around like we were best friends and soooo close. I never really had a mom, she was and still is more like a toxic friend to me. My dad would speak up if it ever got too bad, but he was an enabler too. 
Since my dad & grandma passed all she has left are her 2 best friends which are also alcoholic narcissists. They all have this weird inability to see themselves from an outside perspective. And anyone that speaks negatively of them are automatically wrong or exaggerating. So it's literally like talking to a brick wall trying to explain how I feel or where I'm coming from. 
She occasionally tries to tell me that I'm causing my daughter to grow up without a grandma...like completely not understanding that I procreated with someone else that also has a mother lol"
RBNChildcare,fel9dk5,t1_fel87lh,1579216917.0,"That's very true...I'm an only child and I already come from a small family, so it was a tough decision to even start ""phasing her out""...hell I didn't even realize my mom was a narcissist until my daughter was born and I started noticing that she had this weird mental block about my daughter having two parents, and two families. Then things slowly started to click. 

Moving away from her and building a relationship with my in-laws was the best decision we ever made though, that I can say with confidence."
RBNChildcare,fel6j96,t1_fel3gbo,1579215124.0,"Thank you! I was hopeful we could keep at least minimal contact, it seemed to work for a bit but after this I'm right back to fearing the dramatic repercussions and feeling all the feelings that led me to wanting to go NC to begin with. We were NC for a bit but some deaths in the family led me to wanting to at least somewhat be there. Now enough time has passed I think it's time she gets her own shit together. 

I thankfully have nothing to fear with my in-laws, they're all super down to earth people and know how she operates. They sympathize with her some, but understand the toxic personality isn't worth it. My mother-in-law & mom are already friends on Facebook and she just ignores all the guilt-trip posts."
RBNChildcare,fel5k1x,t1_fel1hxd,1579214527.0,"My mom didn't used to be THIS bad until fairly recently, my dad used to keep it in check but he unfortunately passed away in 2018. Then my grandma helped keep her in check, but she passed away over the summer. Now all she has is her enabling BFF. My daughter still wanted to talk to her for a while but she's starting to see the problem now too. After this I do intend on going NC. She has plenty of family on my husband's side that aren't toxic."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fcxmfnv,t1_fcxi8xs,1578066445.0,"I was a military spouse for 4 years while my husband was in the Navy. There are some cringe-worthy military spouses out there, but probably not many that are THIS bad. Usually they don't demand things for free, but there are a lot that demand a discount. However, on Veteran's Day a lot of places will serve meals for free to active duty or retired military with a valid ID or DD-214 near bases. There were a lot of very vocal spouses demanding that their meal also be free. 

There was also a charity around Christmas that would give out Sears gift cards (this was almost a decade ago) to military families. The amount on the gift card was dependent on how much was donated that year and how many families signed up to receive one. It varied from about $50-$150 while my husband was in. If it was under $100 the support pages on Facebook for military spouses were flooded with ""WhY wAsnT iT MoAR!111!"""

politics,fcrx7vm,t1_fcru68h,1577907863.0,"For real. I'd much rather go into a shop, legally purchase my weed, then drive home without being paranoid about being pulled over. The convenience & legality alone are enough for many to pay those elevated prices. My local dealer also doesn't carry edibles or cartridges, and usually only has one or two strains in at a given time, so yeah also having a larger selection would also be amazing. I'm in Indiana where it likely won't be legalized for a long time, so seeing so many people bitching about their legal weed just blows my mind."
