seduction,fcq869h,t3_ei4iwz,1577880783.0,"I know you don't want to hear ""get a better computer"" but that might be the likely solution. I utilise Google Drive (and the suite) heavily with lots of files, plenty of Google Docs with 100+ pages (pictures throughout) and on my fast computer, it's pretty fast and slow and terrible on my spare laptop. I can't imagine that switching to an alternative on the same computer will yield better results. You can try Evernote (free) though."
productivity,fcq7lav,t3_eig2cx,1577880434.0,Choose one thing. One very small thing. Focus completely on that and do not let the allure of other promised self-improvements distract you until you have achieved that thing. Rinse & repeat.
getdisciplined,fcq79xh,t3_ei79rj,1577880245.0,saves post knowing full well I’ll probably never try this
LearnUselessTalents,fcq72vb,t3_e7migp,1577880132.0,"I doubt this is the answer you want to hear, but... A lot of practice."
LearnUselessTalents,fcq6yw7,t3_ei691d,1577880067.0,I think it's so great you're doing this! I also like your take on it. You have concrete reasons why you're not making these things happen and you aim to work on them consistently. Thanks for the viewpoint and idea!
productivity,fck00kr,t3_eh5o6j,1577712230.0,"There are some pretty eyebrow-raising claims in this article, but I think the most dubious is the ideas that millennials being scared of a recession is a significant reason why they've (we've) invested less. 

I think it has more to to with a poor labor market for 5-6 years after the crash, stagnant wages, and the rising cost of education, health care, and housing. Doesn't leave a lot of money left to invest."
TrueReddit,fcjzwoo,t3_eh5vln,1577712117.0,I feel like this justifies my long standing strategy of buying up everything around the free parking corner as fast as I can.
blowit,fcjxr9p,t3_ehiomh,1577709669.0,May the bridges I burn brighten up the way onwards!
GetMotivated,fcjx0xq,t3_ehdo84,1577708755.0,"Quickly as I'm off to the gym: pomodoro, micro exercise breaks, lunchtime walk (with audio book on headphones), distraction blockers (like cold turkey), positive procrastination (clean a room, vacuum, tidy paperwork, phone someone), check your goals/motives, take a proper break (come back to work when you are re-energised). Ok off to gym..."

seduction,fcjvfao,t3_ehg5h1,1577706656.0,"Put your pointer fingers together and your thumbs together, palms facing away from you. Don't break that connection until you're holding the ball securely. This should form a ""diamond"" of empty space in which the nearest point of the thrown football should land. One it does, close your palms around it securely and bring it in to your body. 

Your hands can be extended away from your body but the greater distance may negatively impact your catching ability."
