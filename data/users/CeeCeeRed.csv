women,fdczvni,t3_ekjlds,1578289378.0,"Success looks different for everyone. I had to rebuild my view on it from having a job, a house, a marriage and starting a family to: I have a job, I can support myself, my bills are paid and my dog is happy, I am happy, and I can save money and also have fun and do things I enjoy. I simply wait tables for a living.
Two friends are married and having a baby, two others are now engaged ( while my marriage failed within a year and spent the other four trying to hold it up and failing spectacularly.)
But now I've met the most wonderful man and I'm so, SO happy with where my life is right now.

You are no imposter, you are you and you are rocking life!

Also, no degrees over here either ;) just sayin."

I still owe him that Money, probably will for awhile longer, but he knows I'll get it to him. He would rather see me in a better job and a bigger apartment before paying him back. Love him to bits."
