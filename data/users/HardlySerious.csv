nottheonion,ff3cm7n,t1_ff3c7gj,1579538484.0,"Except it's not gambling because of a thing called the law.

Here's what gambling means:

>A person engages in gambling if he stakes or risks something of value upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent event not under his control or influence, upon an agreement or understanding that he or someone else will receive **something of value** in the event of a certain outcome.

Because a video game shiny locked to your account is worth nothing, it's not gambling. 

For it to be to be gambling, you have to be able to win more money back then you put down.  You don't win money back when you get a rare shiny, you only lose the same amount of money as if you got something common.  So there's no winning, only losing.

Gamers want to pervert the definition of gambling to include something sentimentally valuable instead of economically valuable.
