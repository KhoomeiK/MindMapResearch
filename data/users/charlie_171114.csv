I can't give you advices on how to live your life or tell you that everything is gonna be better eventually. But I want you to know that it's okay to feel this way, I understand you."
depression,fcz5z63,t3_ejlxgu,1578094352.0,Angry is good. At least you feel something. I don't think you want to reach the point where you don't feel or don't want to feel anything anymore.

depression,fcx3f1l,t3_ejdkyk,1578049507.0,"Yes. Sometimes after a good chat with my friends I did feel more relaxed and start to make small plans for the week.

But a few hours past and all those thoughts of 'having nothing to live for. Nothing matters' and 'why do I even bother' or 'they are all gonna forget about me and leave me eventually' came back to me and I started to feel too much, way way worse than when I  was to begin with. I then dropped every I was doing to literally go to sleep, hoping when I woke up it would all go back to square one when I was just numb and not horrible like this."
