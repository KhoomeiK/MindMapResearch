sarmsourcetalk,ffk4n9g,t1_ffi081q,1580015719.0,"Are you still taking it? I seriously notice the gyno growth so I will stop, and if it improves try again on a low dose. If no improvement or it comes back, definitely ralox. I've always read not to take nolva alongside of a mild sarm especially concerning not completely tanking your estro. while already struggling with the sides. But I could be wrong. What do you think?"
sarmsourcetalk,ffh923w,t1_ffdhxqz,1579926624.0,"I lowered the dose to 10mg ostarine but if it doesn't improve in 2-3 days I will stop and decide what to do. I still am unsure whether or not I should run Ralox by itself, alongside, or something else for gyno sides. I can't seem to find anything yet.

I believe I will use pureraws for Raloxifene as I believe that is the only site in stock."

sarmsourcetalk,ffdd8k2,t1_ffd1l1b,1579818429.0,"Read my comment.. I posted a similar experience on Ostarine and I'm on day 8 (noticed gyno flare up on day 6)... kinda of worrisome for me. This isn't my first rodeo either but I do have SLIGHT gyno from puberty already, albeit slight. Let me know what you figure out. I will do the same for you.

&#x200B;

So far I've heard Ralox is king when it comes to gyno flareups from Ostarine, but I'm unsure whether to run it along the side, wait until after, or completely stop the cycle now and run Ralox on it's own. So far I'm experimenting with a significantly lower dose at 10mg/day rather than 25, but if it doesn't improve I will stop completely."
sarmsourcetalk,ffdd0p8,t3_esvkz8,1579818291.0,"I'm prone to gyno and am starting to experience it on day 6 with Ostarine (this isn't my first rodeo). Here for the advice. That being said & don't want to hijack this, and Obviously it's a different compound, but if someone could point me towards a recommendation for AI for Ostarine (please dont say oh no it doesnt aromatize stfu with your nips - I'm not asking for your advice lol) it would be greatly appreciated."

powerbuilding,ff14qia,t3_equzzw,1579475154.0,"Look into PowerliftingToWin (Izzy Narvaez). Very informative and knowledgeable dude, gets some hate on some forums but I’ve personally know him since I was a kid, used to lift together, he has helped me program and I can personally attest to running some his programs in chronological order. I personally liked them and I implement ideas from them in my own training today"
