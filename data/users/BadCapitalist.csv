cringe,ffcv7dr,t3_esuwws,1579807940.0,This is trying to get a toddler to tell you a story. The guy just doesn't want to admit he was drunk texting.
TheDollop,ffcfo5y,t3_esvlod,1579798449.0,Gritty taking a “running start” just to punch a random 13 year old. Damn Phillies fans are brutal.

PsychologicalTricks,fdort13,t3_emhk6v,1578611456.0,I’m not sure if this is a real thing or not but I have found that just being aware if what type thoughts you’re having is the first step in changing the way you’re thinking.
