Because of the work of the scientist you derided, few people who can access care in the US will ever die from AIDS related illnesses. PreP and education has dropped infection rates to an all time low. In theory HIV could be eradicated in my lifetime. 

Also, you should actually read the studies and reports the CDC puts out. No one there would ever blame this disease on the people who contract it. Instead they acknowledge that risk taking behaviors is a part of every person's life and they (along with thousands of other scientists) continue to find ways to educate people and discover new ways to lessen the damage these behaviors could cause.

The bottom line is that the entire point of a government is to make people's lives better and I know you don't think us queers deserve that, but guess what? We do."

First things first hun, you have yet to state a ""fact"" this whole time we've been chatting, in fact it is painfully obvious you are so far outside your depth. Do you even know what the cdc's plan entailed, you know the one Reagan shutdown? You realize the billions you pointed out are spent TODAY, compared to the couple hundred thousand spent during the actual epidemic. I actually can't believe you were alive during the 80's with this bullshit talk about ""everyone knowing"" how the disease spread, people didn't know shit for years! By the time the cdc isolated the HIV virus thousands were already infected and most had no way of knowing if they were infected or not. If it wasn't for queer activist groups like ACT UP the CDC would have never even got the chance to save as many lives as they did, and thank goodness they did. 

Oh boy I just realized you accused me of being a fucking scientist, like what, you think they are like evil super-villain scientist ringing their hands in delight every time someone catches a communicable disease? What is wrong with you, you homophobic nimrod. And don't you dare talk to ME about the harm HIV has done, you don't actually give a flying fuck about the harm it's done. Your too busy hand-ringing over a couple billion a year that ACTUALLY MAKES THE U.S. MONEY (I dare you to look up the return per dollar when spent on HIV) when we spend literally TRILLIONS killing people for no reason other than to fill the coffers of a bunch of rich pieces of shit. Your pathetic, misinformed, and sad. 

I am queer and I am a scientist, not the kind that would study HIV (at least not for pay), but I wouldn't need to be one to walk circles around an invertebrate coward such as yourself.

Here I'll even help. First, actually look up the offender rate for trans/queer kids, then look up how often they are victimized. Next look up the actual effects puberty blocks (which are sometimes prescribed to teenagers that meet EXTENSIVE criteria) and HRT have on the body. For extra points actually look up the average win/loss ratio for trans students maybe, there are academic studies on this you know.

Also your whole ""getting pregnant by a feminine dick"" is weird and I'm not sure what you think kids NORMALLY do in bathrooms or locker rooms, but dude, that would already be against the rules, why would two kids willing to fuck in the locker room let themselves be stopped by little gender signs on the door?"

todayilearned,ff2xuz5,t1_ff2xffc,1579528091.0,"Thank you! I knew you were going to post that again! Funny enough, I did read and leave out that quote, specifically so I could post the whole context in my next comment! Here it is:

After his celebrity increased, his behavior at conventions became more egregious, as the editor Edward L. Ferman reminisced of a fan gathering in the late 1950s: “Asimov … instead of shaking my date’s hand, shook her left breast.” Asimov was open about his practices: “I kiss each young woman who wants an autograph and have found, to my delight, that they tend to cooperate enthusiastically in that particular activity.” He defended himself by saying that he was universally seen as “harmless,” and the implication that it was all just an act culminated in his satirical book The Sensuous Dirty Old Man (1971), in which he wrote, “The question then is not whether or not a girl should be touched. The question is merely where, when, and how she should be touched.”
Oh boiy, does that sound like someone who is concerned about consent!

OK, two more paragraphs, the next two by the way:

""As the writer Stephanie Zvan has noted, other men routinely enabled the idea that he was only giving a performance. In 1961, the publisher and fan Earl Kemp invited Asimov to give a “pseudo lecture” titled “The Positive Power of Posterior Pinching” at the following year’s World Science Fiction Convention, in Chicago, promising to provide “some suitable posteriors for demonstration purposes.” Asimov declined, but added that he might be persuaded to participate “if the posteriors in question were of particularly compelling interest.” Everything was delivered with a wink, allowing Asimov—who identified as a feminist—to credibly pretend that he was just playing along.

Yet many of these encounters were clearly nonconsensual. When the author Frederik Pohl questioned his tendency to touch women “in a fairly fondling way,” Asimov replied, “It’s like the old saying. You get slapped a lot, but you get laid a lot, too.” Asimov’s biographer Michael White quotes “a friend’s wife” who was pinched at a party: “God, Asimov, why do you always do that? It is extremely painful and besides, don’t you realize, it’s very degrading.” And in a photo—reproduced above—taken by Jay Kay Klein at a convention in 1967, Asimov wraps his arms around a woman who is obviously pushing him away, looking straight into the camera as she tries to avoid his kiss.""

Wow, would you just look at that context!"
todayilearned,ff2xn9j,t1_ff2xdap,1579527893.0,"Oh boy! Do I have some facts about condom failure for you!

todayilearned,ff2x4mp,t1_ff2wu9l,1579527400.0,That is legitimately one of the worst analogies I've seen to excuse homophobia period. A better example would be stealing a blind persons cane and then blaming them for being hit by a car they had no way of seeing.

He literally said in his own book,  The question then is not whether or not a girl should be touched. The question is merely where, when, and how she should be touched.” 

Oh, here's another quote from someone who very much did not want to be touched by him,  “God, Asimov, why do you always do that? It is extremely painful and besides, don’t you realize, it’s very degrading.” 

I wonder if I can quote the article any more? "" Whenever we walked up the stairs with a young woman, I made sure to walk behind her so Isaac wouldn’t grab her tush,” oh yup it looks like I can, that's a normal thing alright. 

In fact, I'm going to leave one more passage here, just to make sure that YOU got the gist of the article.

"" The damage he caused was inseparable from his power. In general, Asimov chose targets who were unlikely to protest directly, such as fans and secretaries, and spared women whom he saw as professionally useful. There were exceptions—he chased the editor Cele Goldsmith around her desk—but he preferred to focus on women who were more vulnerable, which inevitably raises the issue of mentorship.""

I wonder why people are so quick to focus on the positive impact people had and ignore the massive amount of damage powerful people do; who knows how many writers who's dreams were crushed because Asimov was capable of seeing humanity in a machine, but not in a woman."
todayilearned,ff2wbw1,t1_ff2vkxf,1579526615.0,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""the people who run the blood banks"" cause that's not actually how it works. Someone who is operating a blood bank can't just change protocol when they want to, that stuff is dictated through the CDC and other governmental agencies. And the CDC desperately wanted funding and leeway to study HIV even as far back as when it was called GRID, but it was Reagan and his cabinet that shut that down. No one had more power to save the lives of those killed by the AIDS epidemic than the big asshole himself."

Secondly, why are you so quick to try and pretend like this person demanded a boycott of Asimov? All they did was help spread information people should also know about a very important man who did great things, but also abused his power to victimize people less powerful then himself.

While wound to wound contact, or blood to mucus membrane contact should be reported and monitored (and now a days a regime of PreP would be in order)  the risk would be basically non-existent. so please stop spreading misinformation.
