catbellies,fdmcfx7,t1_fdmaqva,1578545497.0,Daw.  I have two cats and one has always been a drooler but my older cat didn't start gracing me with her spit until she started her teens.

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdlntsj,t1_fdkzs96,1578528258.0,We switched to a gentle-leader which turns her around when she tugs.  She's normally so good that after a while I would just take her out without it but the second time she hurt me cured me of that nonsense.  I can't predict when she sees a squirrel.

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdiqhud,t1_fdhuzys,1578448765.0,My boxer did this to me.  Super unpleasant.
