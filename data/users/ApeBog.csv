SuicideWatch,ff0qn3t,t1_fezv6hw,1579471412.0,"Im sorry to hear about how things ended with your friend. I also hope I understand how you are feeling numb. Since there isn't anything wrong with your relationship persay, it feels terrible to not feel the 'flair' like the past. If this is the case, I know how breaking it is for the soul. Somewhere there feels like hopelessness, since there isn't really a 'do x in reaction to y'. There is no manual on how to slowly regenerate the spark you speak of, so it seems like a fight against fate instead of against something in our control. Is my line of thinking close to how you are feeling? If not, I apologize, but I still hope that the decisions you two make allow for you both to heal emotionally and mentally. 
I am happy to hear you are seemingly successful in life (at least according to what society has constructed). Although I don't think financials don't bring us solace, not having to stress at an extreme level about it is at least one variable in life that is beat for the time being. 
In regards to your drive and personality, I understand the feeling of emptiness it brings sometimes. The driven are satisfied by making progress. The journey is preferred over the destination. However, progress really is only happening on the road to said destination. It feels terrible to reach the end since we lose our purpose, but it also feels terrible to run on a treadmill indefinetly, knowing that we will never reach our goal, even if we are 'progressing'. This is at least how I see it. People may think that you don't have great justification for feeling the way you do, because of your degrees, job, etc. But, I don't think people understand that these things that are thought to be what we should be trying to attain is completely arbitrary. The fufuillment may not be present because what we are supposed to be fufilling is society's list of goals. However, with how the world is, there is very little room to try to live for ourselves on a deeper level. Still, congratulations on your progress with your graduates.
I apologize for rambling a bit, but I hope this conversation may be somewhat cathartic. If I am completely missing the ball on helping, let me know. Either way, I still hope things turn out better instead of worse, and that you start to feel better at some point."
SuicideWatch,fezhgc3,t3_eqyjmq,1579457401.0,"I don't think I have the experience to qualify me to relate to you, as I am a sophomore in college with neither a best friend nor a spouse. What I can do is try to understand how you feel though. The first thing that comes to mind is that if we think of the characteristics of best friends and husbands, they are really people that love and care about you and won't turn their backs on you on a whim. I don't know the situation, you, or them, but if this incident was fairly isolated (as in relationship problems have not been present over a longer period of time), then it should be reasonable to hope that whatever was said or done can be mitigated by new words or actions. Do you genuinely want to grow apart from your husband and your friend? If not, they should be understanding in that what may have been done to anger/upset them was during a time where emotions were hightened and amped. I am not saying that your emotions are invalid or what you have done is wrong, but the severity of these things may not be as truthful to how you or they really feel, and that since you had been emotional, your own portrayal of your feelings were uncharacteristically inflated, or even opposite to how you deeply feel.
You don't have to know who you are right now either. I haven't ever had a genuine passion for a career or a hobby and I've given up looking for one. Sometimes, these things are supposed to find us on pure chance or coincidence, so I'm just living and waiting to see if this ever happens. Is my identity strictly a 20 year old college student studying various sciences? Not really. There are thousands of others in the world that can say that about themselves. The tricky part is finding something that makes you you, and me me. Perhaps it is a combonation of such statements that make us different from one another, but it seems that there is something else to it, that makes each person unique in and of themselves. We may never be able to say what this is, but maybe we could have a hazy feeling of what this may be, and understand what we are, even if we cannot describe it. Others close to us can get to know us in this way too. 
I hope that what I have had to say didn't seem... pretentious or non-empathetic. I am not the best in this area, and my ultimate circumstance is that I am in a competitive academic environment, so my way of expressing how I think may be construed in a way that is more suited to that environment, rather than inter-personal social connections and interactions. If there is one thing that I hope you understand or take away from what I have had to say, is that there is at least one other random stranger, possibly thousands of kilometers where you are from, has no idea who you are, and may even have just a single interaction (this post) that still cares about your well being and what you have had to say, even if there is no real benfit to doing so. I hope that your situation becomes less painful and stressful for you, and I'll still be available to chat if you would want to.

SuicideWatch,febsblo,t3_eo9o49,1578962136.0,"Your RWBY dolls still need you to help fight back against Salem and the Grimm! Don't go! Being 13 years old is tough (at least it was for me). All your thoughts, feelings, emotions-they are all valid. No one has the authority to tell you how you should feel or think. I haven't called a hotline for the same reason as you. Its scary. And you are right, mental hospitals are awful. Opening up about our feelings is hard to do nowadays with how society is. But I promise you aren't alone. You sharing this post with this community of people is extremely brave. I haven't gone through what you have. Nobody else in the world has. That doesn't mean we don't care. Even if the only people you can talk to are a bunch of random usernames on this website, remember that each one is another real person. Try imagining a face for every person that has replied to you. That is how many faces care about you and what you are going through. We don't know what you've had to deal with, but we care about you anyways. If you want, I would totally chat about RWBY with you. Also, I have four cats; Ernie, Coal, Kali, Leo, and they say hi to Binxy!

depression,fbf1bx6,t3_eczhm3,1576799019.0,"I think it is important to note that the Christmas your brother speaks of you 'ruining' is his or your family's Christmas. You have no obligation to sacrifice your own happiness for the sake of the 'family'. 

Making a decision seems hard here, as you are seemingly forced to make a sacrifice. What I will say is that making a decision based on inner convictions is more liberating. Making the choice to visit your friend would be following what you truly believe to be right. The obvious complication is the family ostracization. Yes visiting your friend may put you at a worse situation objectively (perhaps losing financial resource, as I do not know your situation, just making an example). However, although from the outside it may seem like you put yourself worse off, from the inside, you will be able to wake up the next day knowing that you started to live as yourself. You never chose your family, you just have been put there by fate. Choosing who you want to have meaningful connections with will start to craft the family you want to participate in. Not the biological family, but the web of relationships with people that are better off knowing you, and you better off knowing them.

This isn't even mentioning what it would mean for your friend if you visited, but I am sure you have that figured out by now. Your family doesn't seem to get that by you visiting your friend, it would mean they had raised someone that helps someone in need. If that isn't something they value, then it may be best to make some more hard choices. I hope the situation becomes a little easier for you, best of luck."
