Whether just having surgical requirements can be considered eugenics is debatable, but specifically including a requirement to be infertile (and in the case of japan, also requiring having no children who are minors) is definitely eugenics.

Also, clearly it's possible to use at least 30% renewable, as the UK does, so the criticism that renewables only account for 10% of total energy is bunk, because we're already far past that. And the UK isn't particularly suited to geothermal energy, and production has quadrupled without any meaningful increase in hydro, so in terms of ""depends on where"" the UK is perhaps one of the less suitable places for renewables.

Also, there's the fact that renewables can be built cost effectively at a smaller scale than nuclear, so more electricity suppliers are willing to put down the cash for a medium sized solar farm than a great big, not unreasonably NIMBY'd nuclear reactor."
