bengals,fexyzfs,t3_eqken0,1579438551.0,"As a long time bengals fan I have mixed feelings. The National view is “weak Oline, need Defense help more, franchise wont put tools in place to help Joe, is the head coach the answer?”
To me the Bengals will be loyal to him and treat him well but I also think the team has shown a history of not capitalizing on Windows of opportunity. And they ARE loyal.. to a unfortunate degree. Lewis should have been gone 2 years earlier, Dalton could have been moved for picks this past year and in all honesty AJ too.. IF Brown really intended to build a contender. That’s unsettling to me and justifies concern for Joe imo..
But the Oline was hurt not necessarily bad, they have a more than solid weapon core and they can devote the rest of their high picks to shoring up the D."
