This is the point. You say that, and you might be right about some bars, it's not like I've done an exacting survey of all bars/restaurants in the US.

But my point is that there's plenty of places, posted about regularly here on Reddit, that do not pay the livable wage unless the employee's 'tips' haven't been sufficient to make up to that amount, meaning that they CAN pay that and are choosing not to.

Tips are fine, as I stated originally. Being paid less than the acceptable liveable minimum and your boss expecting customers to make up the difference is not. I am opposed to management not paying fair wages, not the idea of tipping in general.

For perspective on that, I'm going out for a meal with friends on Sunday. We're expecting to pay a 20-25% tip, since it's somewhere we've been before, it's good food and the staff are good. 

However, there's NO expectation from the restaurant that we will do so. In fact, part of the reason we like the place is they don't even ask for a service charge despite A) the number of people and B) the fact we've booked the private room."

See, you're right, I don't get why it's a cultural thing to tip all the time, but my point is it should be up to the employer to pay their employee, and tips should be a bonus, not used to replace parts of the wage which it is. That just does not seem like a logical or reasonable way to do things to someone from this part of the world.

It's like I don't get why your prices are always listed before tax, (and yes I understand each state has it's own taxes, but surely that doesn't change WITHIN the state?) rather than the ticket showing the full price.

I sort of get the obsession with guns some of your countrymen and women share, but I don't think I agree with it personally. You owning weapons at home I can understand, but I really don't get the need to be carrying one all the time.

Except they don't. Because THEY STILL GET TIPPED if they are working hard enough to justify it. It means the tip returns to being exactly what it's supposed to be, an actual sign of a job well done.
> Plus, labor is usually the #1 cost for restaurants and if the labor cost goes up, the prices go up. So now you’re paying more for worse service.
