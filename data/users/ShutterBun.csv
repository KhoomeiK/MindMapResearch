RetrousseTits,ffvg3kl,t3_evernq,1580263304.0,"Check out a movie called ""Sirens"" for a great scene of her playing in a waterfall/lake."
OldSchoolCool,ffv4ff6,t3_eva60c,1580255428.0,The description for this photo gets more exaggerated every time this photo gets posted.

nottheonion,fftfzbd,t1_fft0awz,1580219456.0,You have a lot to learn if you still think race had anything to do with why the police were called.
youseeingthisshit,fftfs80,t1_ffta1np,1580219293.0,"They’ve had fast passes for months at Disneyland, no?  I’ve never used it, but I recall seeing a separate queue for it."
HungryButts,ffsxyos,t3_ev0p1l,1580197156.0,Quality butt right there.
youseeingthisshit,ffsxvmc,t1_ffswxhc,1580197050.0,"I've found that it depends on the group. If you are with other people who are really into it, it can be a lot of fun."
LarkinLoveXXX,ffsxdkk,t3_euyj3z,1580196408.0,That is quite a title.
youseeingthisshit,ffstw3m,t1_ffsswc2,1580192306.0,"I mean, you literally see it full size from the outside, then go inside it.  It’s about as close as yer gonna get."
youseeingthisshit,ffstua3,t1_ffsslol,1580192251.0,"No, they do a great job.  You get a colored “team card” or whatever, and they give you about 5 minutes to hang around in the ship for photos, etc.  it’s all very legit (including the chess board).  When it’s time for your group to depart, they call “blue team!” and you go line up. There’s plenty of time/space for photos."

todayilearned,ffppkoy,t1_ffpnyso,1580101312.0,Roland Emmerich is incapable of such.
todayilearned,ffppg0t,t1_ffpnrsm,1580101195.0,But Bill Pullman has zero charisma in that movie.  He plays the whole role as if he doesn’t want to be there.
todayilearned,ffppdxt,t1_ffpmih8,1580101143.0,That’s a fair cop
todayilearned,ffpmgjj,t1_ffp33zn,1580098714.0,Area 51 is just a nickname given to the area by civilians based on a particular map that had areas numbered.  There is no officially designated place called “Area 51”.
todayilearned,ffpma65,t1_ffpby43,1580098578.0,I will never understand why the speech gets so much praise.  It’s total treacle and cliche and delivered terribly.

LosAngeles,ffh5gx9,t1_ffgrsto,1579923645.0,What does that have to do with RV’s?
LosAngeles,ffgeeo0,t1_fffzal2,1579904382.0,My point is that “gentrification” should no longer be used as an excuse for people to park RV’s on crowded streets.
LosAngeles,fffyscg,t1_fffte0c,1579894755.0,Echo Park has been expensive for over a decade by now.
