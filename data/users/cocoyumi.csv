bulletjournal,ffen1ro,t3_eszfoa,1579855264.0,I love it- I’ve been trying to work out something super minimal for a monthly view and this is pretty good !
BetterEveryLoop,ffelz74,t3_et4lxu,1579853762.0,"Having a shelf of tiny pottery would actually encourage me to do pottery, because I fear any hobbies that will fill my house up with clutter than I can’t get rid of because I made it once. :T"
BetterEveryLoop,ffelxpl,t1_ffej5n7,1579853709.0,You could possibly put some kind of flat surface on the end of a drill bit. I’m sure it’s perfectly safe
Showerthoughts,ffchfnq,t1_ffcfaxr,1579799531.0,I meant like if we lived underwater for example and ‘got dry’ once a day instead of a shower. Like an evaporation room lol. Then left and stayed wet 24/7. I guess I wasn’t specific enough
BPD,ffch9f6,t1_ffcfibn,1579799425.0,I agree with everything you’re saying. When I’m at a really low point though I don’t think logic really works properly in my brain. Maybe this is more a personal thing then
Showerthoughts,ffcb1xo,t1_ffcauj4,1579795578.0,Maybe in an alternate reality that’s how we would all get clean.
AskReddit,ffb06r9,t3_eskc2n,1579748564.0,"We played on a discord server with some other people and he used to roast me a lot - and changed my server name to lil’ Roastie. It wasn’t mean stuff it would occasionally be cute enough to make me wonder, or he would jokingly protect me slightly more in overwatch at times, stuff like that. Anyway i moved across the country and in 2 months-ish we’ll have been together for a year :)"
bulletjournal,ff8hzju,t3_erv6lb,1579679351.0,"I’m in the same boat! So far I gave up any weekly/monthly spreads because I don’t really have anything to track in those. I use it for budget tracking, tracking my walks and distance progress etc, tracking moods, and I’m going to make a plant water / care scheduling spread too :) most of my stuff is update as I go.  
Edit: oh and I also have a daily to do-list kind of page but I use sticky notes so I can replace them each day and not have to use a new page and layout every time :)"
bulletjournal,ff8als1,t3_eri6j8,1579671018.0,I’m so jealous! My washis are getting out of hand..  also can I ask what journal you use? My markers bleed straight through mine and it was kinda high end :/
bulletjournal,ff8ac0g,t3_es6fiz,1579670762.0,"Idk if I’ll get downvoted for saying this, but having worked across numerous male-dominated fields: there is ALWAYS something they will find to put you down for being there and being female. Unless you’re ‘one of the guys’ women who join in with their shit. Do what makes you happy, let your efficiency show through your work not your journal styles. They can go to hell."
bulletjournal,ff8a6cs,t3_eryvh1,1579670611.0,Watch out.. it’s addictive. I started 2ish months ago and already own 200+ rolls of washi tape xD

DiWHY,fevnkbp,t3_eqkbv9,1579399385.0,If only the icon was big enough resolution to show a person holding the glue gun to their head
AskReddit,feiwyin,t3_ep7tm4,1579149492.0,"All I want by kodaline, soldier on by the temper trap, or times like these by Eden project especially because it reminds me of someone who I used to be with and still love."
bulletjournal,fedlgav,t1_fedla4q,1579014444.0,I don’t mind! I actually never did an index.. at the moment I’m using page tabs from folded over washi tapes with icons drawn on them (money for the budget tracker etc). Maybe I’ll need an index at some point but I thought about doing the kind that is pasted onto the back cover and can fold out and be viewed while you’re using the bujo
aww,fdq5c9g,t1_fdpp0wr,1578655546.0,One started near my house a few days ago and luckily along with some other people who stopped we were able to douse it with water from the car. Then the firies soaked the whole park. Based on the location next to the road we suspect it was a cigarette butt. One idiot throwing their cigarette butt out the car window is enough to start a massive fire in this heat. I don’t know how people are so dumb with what’s going on.
