metaldetecting,ffp2v8x,t1_ffosxto,1580085121.0,Good point there. After doing some research I found that metal detectors are a lot more sophisticated than they appear.
metaldetecting,ffosk88,t1_ffopfws,1580081162.0,Thank you that answered my question. I'm still a couple weeks away from making my purchase so I'll be doing plenty of reading. I did a quick search and it seems like the vanquish 440 is a lot better than the garrett and way cheaper also.
metaldetecting,ffonzu6,t1_ffo9pox,1580079756.0,Thank you for your input. I will do some more research and reading before I make my purchase. I'm not looking to do any gold prospecting yet but if there are any gold rings or coins in the ground then I'd like to have a detector that can pick up on those items. I'm new to this subreddit so I'm trying to soak in as much info as I can. There's a lot of old small towns and abandoned buildings in my area so I'm excited to get out there to see what I can find.
metaldetecting,ffnh0dn,t1_ffnd09k,1580065856.0,"I was wondering about this as well. I was looking at saving up to buy a garrett ace 400 but still have some questions. Would a detector in that price range pick up gold rings and bracelets and things like that? Do all detectors pick up on all metals? Do detectors with higher frequencies pick up on only tiny gold nuggets and only specialized for gold prospecting? 

Pardon my ignorance but this is still pretty new to me and I'm trying to learn as much as I can before I make my purchase."

If its the rear differential I could imagine it wouldn't be terribly hard to swap an old fashioned style differential from a car with independent rear suspension.

Its usually one of the first things that fail on a evap system. It won't show up on the smoke test since the smoke goes into the intake manifold if it leaks. Its in the closed position by default and supposed to be air tight. It can be easily checked with a hand vacuum pump by checking at the hose that connects to the intake manifold.

MechanicAdvice,fe6krf6,t1_fe61pua,1578894156.0,It shouldn't matter where you bought it from. Buying a car from somewhere other than the dealer doesn't void the warranty.
MechanicAdvice,fe6knll,t1_fe6brjx,1578894050.0,The transmission fluid. Most places rarely even check the  transmission fluid so no surprise they didnt say anything about it. I'm not sure about your particular nissan but on most newer cars its impossible to check the fluid without draining some and there's a procedure for setting the fluid level. Call the dealer and give them the vin and they should be able to tell you if its covered or not. Google isnt always accurate with these things.
MechanicAdvice,fe6kcfp,t1_fe6bvu3,1578893740.0,Dont go by what google says. Call the dealer and have them check your vin. A failed transmission is a major safety concern. If it falls under extended warranty they cant deny the warranty claim.
MechanicAdvice,fe6648s,t1_fe5yvip,1578882636.0,"Even if your warranty expired you can always try calling nissan corporate and complain. Sometimes they give in and cover it anyways free of charge since it is a well known problem. Sometimes they will cover half of the cost but it just depends on your case. You have a better chance of doing this if you bought the car new or certified pre owned and got it serviced at the dealership. 

My first dealership job was at an acura dealer and sometimes I would see transmissions be warrantied on cars that had 160k miles if the customer made a big enough deal about it."
MechanicAdvice,fe65b07,t1_fe5yvip,1578882109.0,"What is the condition of the fluid and when has it been serviced last? An oil change and fluid level check may keep it going normally for a while. The fluid degrades and its possible that you may have had some fluid leak so the transmission may be low on fluid. Most cars nowadays don't have a transmission fluid dipstick so its nearly impossible to check the level and fluid condition. Its fairly cheap to do a transmission service but there's no guarantee that it will fix your problem. 

I worked at a nissan dealership for a while and transmissions are always being warrantied. I would call your local nissan dealership and give them your vin. They can run it for free and check your warranty status. There's a chance there was a warranty extension since this was a very common problem. You may get a free transmission replacement."
MechanicAdvice,fe5x0km,t1_fe5wjw5,1578876839.0,Nissans are notorious for transmission issues. Does it still drive ok? If it does then its possible that it may be a fluke. I would try clearing the code first. If it comes back immediately then you have an issue for sure. Unfortunately most of the time it requires transmission replacement.

weed,fdrxh5h,t1_fdrge7b,1578691240.0,I'm sure that will happen less often once your tolerance goes up. I've been smoking for close to a decade now and it only really happens when I get in the zone and have a really good smoke session. Its never scary or anything like that.

askcarsales,fdqgnzb,t3_emqxrs,1578666200.0,V6 or 4 cylinder? If v6 automatic then it will certainly have transmission issues sooner or later. If its 4 cylinder I wouldn't worry about much other than regular maintenance.
MechanicAdvice,fdp50cx,t3_emit03,1578620137.0,"I heard that old style injectors in nissans cant really tolerate the ethanol in the fuel these days. Its possible that the injector may be spraying too much fuel or is hanging open.
