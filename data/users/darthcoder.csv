I think thats fair.   

Also no more freebies to the oil industry in military aid to third world despots, you and,i are in 100% agreement there.

But the you also need,to include the recycling and mining costs of lithium and thr materials to build windmills and solar panels, and include the pollution costs of both.  Since most are made,in China, im having a hard time finding any estimates of said effects.  If you know of any reputable sources, im intetested in heaing them. 

Ive been working on a paper on EVs for a year now for school and the supply chain pollution thing is a black box for me.  Im slightly negative on them at the moment but if we can get an order of magnitude better improvement on battery density or longevity (useful life in years), Id certainly change my mind."
