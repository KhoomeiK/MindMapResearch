>""I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.""

Lennon was a violent young man (like so many young men), but eventually learned to control his anger. He sought self-improvement. His marriage with Yoko was much healthier, and not violent (according to Ono). 

I think it is important to call out abusers, but I think it's also important to show that people can change and grow and get better. A violent man does not always have to be violent. I think Lennon is a role model for this."

I really recommend not listening to your mom or anyone else when it comes to what you wear. You need to feel like yourself at your wedding.

LGBTWeddings,ff78k1m,t3_eqfaec,1579643240.0,"I totally hear you. 

IMO one of the best perks of having a queer wedding is that there's no weird patriarchal baggage. There are no traditions, no customs- it's all brand new! Any wedding element you include will be because you thought really hard about whether you wanted to include it, not because it's expected. 

I'll admit, if I was having a hetero marriage I probably would have had some really weird mixed feelings about a wedding. Heterosexual marriage, for most of its existence, was about a transfer of property. A lot of those traditions genuinely ARE sexist. But because I had a lesbian wedding instead I just fully embraced the whole thing without any trepidation. It was wonderful. 

And you're right- it was really meaningful that at the beginning of our relationship it wouldn't even be legal for us to marry. That's something worthy of celebration. You might enjoy reading [the post I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/4nwjhc/to_my_fellow_queer_weddingplanners_xpost/) here and in /r/weddingplanning after the PULSE nightclub massacre.

It’s true lilies like asiatic lilies that cause renal failure. Peace lilies are similar in toxicity to a pothos or philodendron. 

I do a lot of research on plants and cats because I have a cat that likes to eat plants. I have several peace lilies but wouldn’t ever bring a real lily into my house."
plantclinic,fd9l7j6,t1_fd6u4v2,1578234920.0,"Important to note that peace lilies are not the same level of toxic as other types of lilies. They contain insoluble calcium oxalate crystals which cause irritation and swelling of the mouth and digestive tract. They certainly can cause some nasty and dangerous symptoms, but are not super likely to be deadly unless your cat eats a massive amount or has a particular sensitivity. 

Other lilies, like asiatic lilies or day lilies that you commonly find in cut flower bouquets, will straight up kill your cat with even a tiny exposure. They will shut down your cat’s kidneys and there’s nothing you can do about it. 

Just putting this out there in case someone has heard about lilies being poisonous, but had their cat be fine after taking a bite out of a peace lily leaf. Don’t take that to mean the danger of lilies is over-hyped. It’s just a different type of lily."

Hitchiker's Guide is as classic of the ""funny"" scifi genre (which I would say Scalzi is certainly at least on the edge of), so def read that at some point.

There's nothing in particular that it shares in theme with Old Man's War (aside from a first-person male narrator), but for some reason I think you'd like it.

For the record, as a recipient of a hyphenated last name who fully plans to give my child a hyphenated last name, there's nothing anti-feminist about passing down only one.
