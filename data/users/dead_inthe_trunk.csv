FundieSnark,ffjwcc5,t3_ettys3,1580008735.0,"Let me just say, this quote blows. 

That being said, the actual idea from the Bible is from Jesus’s sermon on the mount from Matthew 5-7.  The actual English interpretation is roughly- look up and down. God even attends to the needs of birds, so how can one question that God would not care for you? Aren’t a person more important than a bird? 

It’s a part of the Bible I really really love because it offers a reminder just how to shift your perspective when life and struggle seems overwhelming, but I don’t think Jesus meant that people should flush their drugs and pray, like some idiots (Paul and Morgan)."

We didn’t have birthday parties (aside from a small gathering on their 1st) until they were 5 or so.  A huge party is a waste of everyone’s time and money and that’s why OP is upset, her ego is hurt. You have the right idea. Hold off on the parties till school-age, your sanity will thank you. Keep the experiences idea going, it is so much more rewarding. 

I did not even want to reply to OP because I get the hurt, but the whole thing is so dumb in the grand scheme of being a parent. Birthday parties SUCK unless you are the birthday kid."

breakingmom,fe7r5bi,t1_fe683uy,1578918230.0,"Hey, so I have some practical life experience on this. I unexpectedly got pregnant by my ex boyfriend and I already had two with my ex-husband. I chose to terminate even though I would have been able to be a good mom to that baby.  I didn’t want to further divide my time/resources. I looked at my living kids and decided their future was more important than the hypothetical one I was carrying. I was absolutely not willing to sacrifice any dime or time for the baby. I then decided I was not willing or able to co-parent with the person who got me pregnant. I had no desire to tie my life to his indefinitely. 

You are allowed to feel sad that the circumstances didn’t work out. You are allowed to feel sad about termination (I still do sometimes!) if you want to have this baby, that’s ok too!!  I wasn’t sure I could go through with mine but I did, and I’m relieved and sad at the same time, even 5 or 6 years later. The days and weeks following the procedure can be tricky. I poured myself back into my children and it helped a LOT.  The immediate relief I felt driving away helped me too, and as a final thought, there was a recovery area were we all waited to leave and we talked- every person in that room had kids, some had many.  We all made that decision because we knew how hard pregnancy and motherhood was. Each of us were already parents and chose the well-being of our living children."

GifRecipes,fdynew5,t1_fdvm5xc,1578781689.0,"well, I made it for dinner. It’s good. Just some thoughts- I feel like if I make it again, I’ll skip the parm because no amount of cheese made it ‘more cheesy’. In the end it felt like I had dumped empty calories into my family’s plate. The butternut squash had a delicious cheesy texture as it was without the need of extra cheese, and I used a lot. I skipped heating it and just used the heat from the noodles and sauce to melt and it worked great. 

It needed a TON of salt, even with the pasta water salted. Like a ton. We are meat eaters to the extreme, but this was enjoyable, if heavy. Next time I will definitely omit the cheese altogether and maybe use a broth in place of milk and serve it as a side and not a main. My daughter has troubles eating enough and she ate this happily and heartily, so I will probably include it into the rotation."

Her dress wasn’t glitz enough, I chose not to do a lot of makeup, she didn’t have a tan, and had a total meltdown on stage (this was wayyy before her ASD diagnosis).  There were tv pros there and filming being done for some foreign special- we didn’t even stay for crowning- just left as soon as she was done.

breakingmom,fdqbep9,t1_fdqarji,1578662006.0,"That’s really good to know. I think the issue is that we don’t know what she needs. I don’t even know what she’d need. Because she’s a girl, she has done an amazing job coping with the school environment more than a boy in her class who is also on the spectrum. That boy has a social worker and a sped class. He is bullied pretty badly, but when my daughter has a meltdown, she has a group of kids to protect her and ‘fix’ it for her. That won’t be the case next year in middle school. In fact, when I sat down with the school psychologist they actually told me he doubted she was on the spectrum because she has friends."
breakingmom,fdqa4zc,t1_fdq8h2g,1578660837.0,"Thank you thank you for your story. I doubt myself all the time- but it is exactly like you say - 90% is fine, but that 10% is what I spend so much time waiting for.  People doubt her diagnosis... until a meltdown. She is just the sweetest and most loving, caring kid... until she’s overwhelmed.  Her school refuses an IEP or any intervention because she does well on standardized testing and has friends.  How stupid is that?"

She preferred to play alone, even in a room of kids. She avoided eye contact with any adult who wasn’t me or her dad.  She had/has massive tantrums when she couldn’t get what she wanted because she couldn’t communicate it. She cried a LOT her first two years. We had an older child who is typical- so from about 4 months on I knew she was different but never knew why. She just was different. Her communication was different and her emotional state was different. For years I didn’t know if this was because she had a neuro abnormality, because she was a preemie, or if that was how all girls were (our older child was a boy)."
breakingmom,fdp4oa9,t1_fdp3ty6,1578619915.0,"Her dad refused to allow any testing or help whatsoever until I called CPS and they told him to get his head out of his ass, so I empathize with your BIL.  I also manage all of her appointments and specialists. He never has once attended any of her medical visits. Your nephew is being set up for success by a young diagnosis. She got hers at 10, and only because she pulled out most of her eyelashes, eyebrows, and hair from anxiety. She is also a girl so she presents differently than a boy. She ‘passes’ better so to speak in that most people wouldn’t know about her issues unless they’re told."

I was humiliated and so so frustrated. I don’t know anyone else with a challenging child and I feel so unequipped.

Edit: I wish to add, my daughter’s disordered eating, weight, and general malnutrition is not due to body image issues or from withholding food. She is on the spectrum and has a very particular palette. She just does not have that switch in her brain that tells her to eat. She doesn’t crave any kind of foods or really enjoy eating in any way. It’s a biological necessity for her, but it’s challenging because she’s weird about texture and strongly dislikes most protein sources. We have a dietician."

The 50’s and suburbia changed all that for families and the nuclear family and isolation became the normal.
