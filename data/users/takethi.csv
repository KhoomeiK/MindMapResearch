Given that the album was almost finished before his death, he probably had a large part in the vision for this merch, maybe he even had the designs finished. 

Mac always had one coherent vision for his projects, I don't think he ever designed merch after finishing an album. There is even a cover of a 70s song on the album lol... 

It fits perfectly IMO. I am quite sure that at least the vision for these is from Mac himself."
worldnews,fejqq7f,t1_fej9wne,1579183462.0,"Not only according to those people. Many democrats/progressives/anti-trumpists believe that he only does these stupid things to stay relevant and appeal to his base. They believe that Trump is actually just portraying a character and using that comically incompetent and offending image as a strategy to stay in the minds of his base, sell merch, fill rallies etc.... 

Basically they think that because his ""strategy"" is working (and there is no denying that, he is president and likely will be for another 4 yrs), it must be planned and on purpose and Trump must be a very evil genius. I should know because my dad is one of them. 

Those are mostly people who don't follow the Trump-news as closely as many people on the internet do. If you follow mainstream-news, you will hear only about the biggest of his fuckups, and those still make up for like 50% of the news about him. Covering all of his stupid crap is literally impossible for the mainstream media, because Trump is a moronic senile grandpa 100% of the time. And on top of that, the biggest of Trump's fuckups are so monumentally big that from the perspective of any somewhat educated person, it seems nigh on impossible that someone with Trump's level of success (or anyone for that matter) could *possibly* be that retarded. 

The logical conclusion is that he is using it as a purposeful strategy."

MacMiller,fejgkbv,t3_ephhaa,1579173230.0,Nice. Good on you for not spoiling anything. Hope the others who go to the listening parties won't either.
MacMiller,feja40n,t3_epglsz,1579163632.0,"This is a really nice piece that was posted a year ago by /u/CallmeBigfat.

I was wondering if anyone has the skills and time and wants to edit this so the album covers are all in the normal horizontal orientation. IMO it would be even better that way."
MacMiller,fej9fh5,t3_epe66d,1579162692.0,"The yinyang with 'REMEMBER' around it would be another good option.

(Also because 'REMEMBER' starts and ends with an R, so just like a circle it goes back where it's from ;) )"
