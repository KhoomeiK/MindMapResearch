AskLEO,ffika7t,t1_ffik08x,1579975894.0,I should add I called about an hour after the fact because I had no way to call at the time and it was a parking lot thing so nobody to talk to in person.  So it had to wait until I was at home. The dispatcher just asked for the location of the incident and had the right person call back later. And it was a good thing because nobody else had any info on who did it!!  I didn’t get a license plate but it was a company vehicle that did the damage which narrowed things down a lot.

BabyBumps,ffg1wvs,t3_esydk3,1579896680.0,"The most important thing is a living mom and baby. Yes a natural birth is preferable when it is safe, so it’s a reasonable initial goal to set, but lots of factors can make it unsafe. And then waaay better to do a planned c section than to attempt a vaginal birth if it has little chance of success!!!  There is no reason to shame someone for making the most reasonable and intelligent decision for their situation. 

  I was pretty close to needing one for my last baby but then she did turn.  I would not have argued but definitely would have been unhappy about the change in plans. 

Then people gave me crap about inducing, at least people who didn’t know about my previous baby. He was a very precipitous delivery so for the next one we did a “natural” induction and AROM to avoid a roadside birth. It worked very well and the pushing stage had no warning and lasted less than a minute. I was not having strong contractions for more than 15 minutes before the birth. I’m convinced that a natural labor would have resulted in the baby coming during the drive. 

But if there was a complication that required a c section you better believe I’ll choose a living baby over an idealized birth!!!  Give me a difficult recovery over a funeral any day.  And much better to be able to plan and prepare for it if possible.  Glad you are able to go in with both eyes open!  Wishing you the best for you and your baby!"

Reformed,ff37t4z,t3_ercl09,1579535731.0,"I disagree very much with calling it stupid.  Birth control is such a touchy subject.  There are MANY  valid reasons to use it, and MANY valid reasons not to.  I really think it depends on each couple's relationship with God and each other.  

Story time: It has been heavy on my mind recently.  I am expecting our fifth child, and she was conceived despite the use of a barrier method.  My husband wanted more children but I did not, and had asked for more time (he is a very patient man and would NEVER NEVER force something on me).  It was a subject that came up a LOT.  I really think that God was working on me because I was ALMOST ready to consider ditching the birth control when this baby came to be.  Shortly before that people would ask what our plans were and I was super defensive, probably because I was sinfully ignoring both God and my husband in this area.  I do feel that I should have submitted to my husband sooner.  It was funny because right when this happened I had decided that we could start trying in maybe two months.  I remember praying to God that I did not feel ready yet so if He wanted us to have another baby before I was ready, He would have to make it happen despite me using birth control.  Well... it may or may not have happened within DAYS of that prayer.  But then when I realized what He had done, He changed my attitude completely and helped me see how I had been ignoring His leading and also my husband's wishes.  Please note that He showed me my attitude was the problem, not the use of birth control ever.

My husband and I have both agreed at other times about using birth control for other reasons, especially in the first year or two, because that gives my body more time to recover and it also gives the child longer to nurse, since my milk tends to decrease dramatically during pregnancy.  I generally \*can't\* conceive for a year and a half at least but I am able to be a more willing spouse if we do use birth control.  

I don't know what God will decide as far as future children, but I know He will give me what I need to handle whatever He decides.  I just don't want to have to drive one of those huge huge vans... a minivan is hard enough to maneuver.

Anyway, to preach from the pulpit that using birth control is stupid seems totally inappropriate.  Also, some couples use no birth control and still have no children, or maybe just one or two surviving children after losses.  So people shouldn't judge on family size either.  Infertility and miscarriages are painful enough without adding that sort of pain on top of it.  Much better to encourage couples to seek God in this area, to pray together and separately about it."
homeowners,ff2vyq9,t3_er7ecf,1579526237.0,Our fireplace has bifold doors on each side and those make a mini chimney that lets smell and a little smoke out. So we put a magazine or a piece of cardboard on top of the open doors to block it and it makes a huge difference.
HomeImprovement,ff0bxns,t3_eqrkpl,1579467430.0,"Yes!   I LOVE LOVE LOVE to do stuff around the house.  Putting things together (furniture, swingset, whatever), electrical (outlets, fixtures... not so much wiring), basic plumbing, painting, repairs... all things I really enjoy.  All the little improvements that get done around the house are generally my ""job.""  In fact, I just started redoing the basement (we did most of the demo together) when I got pregnant, and most of what is left involves working with TSP, primer, paint, other chemicals, and heavy lifting (installing a toilet), so now it's just not getting done- there's no ventilation downstairs so the doctor thought it would not be wise for me to continue.  So it's either have my husband do it, hire it out, or wait a year.

My husband is perfectly capable- the big project he did was laying the LVP in our main living areas, and he did a great job.  That was one it made more sense for him to do because we had a nursing baby at the time and older children and needed them out of the house for the duration.  It wasn't his favorite thing to do, but he got it done.  And for some tasks, like demo or heavy lifting that requires two people, we work together.  But I generally drive the direction of the work and coordinate hiring contractors when something is beyond my comfort level (again, wiring, and any plumbing beyond replacing fixtures and busting clogs). 

So we'll see what happens with the basement.  I lean toward at least getting a quote, because he's just not motivated and I hate to be a nag.  He had to take over more with household/kid stuff (my load in addition to what he normally does) during the first trimester anyway because I was SO sick so it's not like he could have done it then.  But he told me he wants to work on it soon.  So we'll see."
todayilearned,feuk1vj,t1_fetwbqs,1579387251.0,"It's just one of those things that happens when you are juggling kids and keys and have to buckle kids in (or just drop your keys on the floor).  They just use a little balloon thingy with a wedge to get the door a little open.  I saw it not work once, so the mom had to wait for her husband to be able to get extra keys and come back (luckily they HAD an extra set of keys).  Mom and baby were both pretty upset by that point.  Police and bystanders all were comforting Mom telling her ""we've all done something like this, you just had extra bad luck.""

Years later and I STILL have to remind myself to use the blasted lanyard instead of setting the keys down!!

todayilearned,feui1sd,t1_fetvc5j,1579386728.0,"There's no reason to involve CPS- I never left them (except to get help, which still was not a violation of state law because it was in sight of the car).  Easy to see it was an accident, plus the person who called stuck around was able to verify I was JUST in the store with the kids.

Somehow the door lock button got pushed (on the fob I guess?) and I had set the keys next to the child I was buckling because of a lack of pockets- forgot to grab the keys again (yes, I added a lanyard after that).  Just an overall bad coincidence but a total accident.  Cops could see that.  And I think CPS would be annoyed to have to follow up on something like that.

I know multiple people who have done something similar (mostly moms, because women's pants pockets either don't exist or aren't always big enough to hold keys), and it hasn't been a huge deal.  There's a difference between misplacing keys and leaving children for long periods on a hot day."

Still had two cars there in less than five minutes.  One wedged the door open and reached something in to unlock the door and the other made faces at the kids to amuse them.

hoarding,fdit7yb,t3_elhnju,1578450508.0,"I have ""been there"" to a lesser (and different) extent.  My MIL was not this bad, it was more that the cupboards and closets and drawers and basement were overstuffed, but the upstairs looked fairly normal (except it was hard putting stuff away because of the full closets...).  So it was much more tolerable than your situation. 

Things I learned: 

1. If you clean up a messy spot, it will get messed up again.  I cleaned the fridge and cupboards SO SO SO many times and they would just get filled again.  Once I threw away 30+ bags of walnuts that each had maybe one or two tablespoons of walnuts left in it.  Typical pattern was to open a new container of something for ""company"" no matter how many partial containers were in the fridge.  So it would just keep building up.
2. The only areas we could control were our own room and later rooms (our family grew and she gave us a second room).  Even then we didn't have all the closet space but oh well.  We kept what we could in the shape we wanted to.
3. If you throw away some useless looking object they will ask about it 3 years later and remember exactly where it should be.  And then get upset if you tossed it or might have tossed it.

In our situation the plan was for us to take over the house, so she actually moved out and left us with (most of) the hoard.  We've made enormous progress over the past year and a half (we just left it alone for a few years thinking she'd deal with it faster but she didn't) but it's been hard.  But we have more freedom to throw away since she isn't actually living here and if she asks about something and it's gone I just say, ""sorry, it was either moldy or had been chewed/pooped on by mice.  can't have that in the house with our children.""  But it's different now that it's our house.  We couldn't do that when she was here.  Cleaning out the fridge or pantry was ""bad"" enough.

Spending time out of the house is helpful, and really the only thing that will alleviate the situation is to stop living under the same roof with hoarders.  I wouldn't bother cleaning anything except for food gone bad.  It's just an exercise in futility.  Like brushing teeth with a mouth full of cookies."

We're not 100% into the classical model of education, but agree with several components including memorizing facts at the grammar stage, and learning Greek and Latin to better understand our own language (Latin also help a LOT with French, plus Latin is a core subject at the hybrid homeschool program they attend twice a week).  It may also be useful in studying the New Testament as they get older.  I think he'd enjoy teaching Hebrew for the better understanding of the Old Testament as well, but he only took a semester of that and is much more comfortable with Greek.

For an example in how my husband uses Greek to reinforce other concepts, I have to share a funny story that happened recently.  So he was teaching the Greek word for naked - gymnos - and was telling my son about how they used to work out naked, and then he had to look up a word to reinforce in English and found that gymnophobia is the fear of nakedness (either being so or seeing others) and made an English card for that.  And of course since he uses a picture, he found something from the Mr. Bean episode where he loses his bathing suit and people freak out.

My husband decided to drop that in order to focus on the languages and math (everything takes a very long time, my son has a bit of a processing delay I think and it was very frustrating).

We have some freeze dried food but are trying to gradually build the depth of our storage of things like flour, beans, rice, and basic cooking staples so that if we couldn't go to the store for months on end we'd have enough on hand.  I don't know if we'd ever get to two years' worth or not, right now we don't have a great system set up yet, but maybe eventually.  Right now we have our kitchen a bit over-full with our extras, but they'd probably only last a few weeks at this point.  Baby steps!!"

He has used it to teach words using ESL type decks he made with pictures. And they learn those words in French and English. Also some geography (starting with continents).

So I'm still on track for where I want to be- since I started at the high end of normal (like 3# shy of overweight) I want to keep my gain to 25 pounds.   I wasn't tracking calories in the 1st tri because it was just a blur but now I'm feeling better and able to eat normal food without gagging- yay! 

The practice I see requires a 3 day food log before the second appointment, so I'm going to use that to kick start logging again and try to stick with it for a while until I get a sense of my slightly higher TDEE.  I'm used to shooting for 1500-1700 depending on activity level.  But now it looks like 1700-1900 is my baseline goal for now, though one site said 2000 (I'll start on the lower end and raise it a bit if needed).  It was easy to do 3 meals of 500 calories and then a 100-200 cal snack on days with a decent amount of exercise.  But now I'm having trouble eating full meals (heartburn) so I've been eating more times in the day.  But still staying about the same weight for a week or two.  I'm probably obsessing more than I need to, but I really don't want to put on too much like in previous pregnancies- controlled gain is almost harder than losing!!!

Plumbing,fcsu7lb,t3_eiogir,1577925223.0,"Try citric acid powder.  That has worked SO SO SO much better than conventional cleaners and it also doesn't have an odor, which is a bonus for me.  You can order bulk bags of the stuff on Amazon or wherever, some stores may carry it.

Anyway, put a good 1/2 cup of the stuff in the bowl (with the water in) and let it soak for a while.  Probably half an hour if you have time.  Then a regular toilet brush should get most of it up.  If it doesn't the first time, you could repeat it, maybe with just the amount of water that is in your pic so the citric acid is really concentrated.

 I've had buildup that bad and spent HOURS chipping away at it using layers of a ""natural"" cleaner (after regular bowl cleaner failed) that did get it up.  Found out one of the ingredients for fighting hard water stains was citric acid.  Bought some of that stuff, so much cheaper, by the way, and it worked so much better all by itself.

My maintainence routine now includes putting 1/4-1/2 cup into the toilet bowl when I'm starting to clean the bathroom, doing some other stuff, then using the brush and any little buildup comes off easily."

A move in a few months is not that close - a few months is a long time in the life of a toddler at that age. 

Plus if it doesn’t “take” easily you can always go back to diapers. If it does, bonus!!  Might as well see if this is her “window.”

Two kids still felt crummy most of the day then a third had ear pain Sat night.

breastfeeding,fcejsye,t1_fcb3t5o,1577621162.0,"Multiple professionals have recommended ibuprofen to me for clogged ducts. It is not recommended during pregnancy, but is fine for nursing. I have also been told to alternate it with acetaminophen to keep the fever down."
breastfeeding,fcayvbm,t3_egyihr,1577579340.0,"I don't think you are out of the woods.  Here are some more home remedies you can try:

\-eat raw garlic (it tastes awful but it can help with infection)

\-dissolve epsom salts in a bowl and lean over, dipping the affected breast in the bowl (be careful, this can reduce your supply, but you should be able to build it up again after if that happens with frequent nursing)

\-It may hurt like nothing else, but you NEED to have baby nurse on that side, nothing gets clogs out like a baby.  Try laying baby on his/her back, and kneeling over to feed in addition to regular holding.

\-take ibuprofen- it will help with the inflamation

\-keep taking the lecethin

\-maybe try a cabbage compress (see warning above re. epsom salts and supply)

If you are getting a fever you need to be careful.  Mastitis can turn into an abscess, which is a situation that involves expensive imaging, IV antibiotics, and possibly a hospital visit.  

You should be able to get seen at urgent care for $100-150 to get a prescription for antibiotics, and even if you can't really afford it, I would do whatever it takes to get seen if your fever doesn't go down in another day or day and a half.  Call ahead and explain that you are paying out of pocket, what kind of payment plans do they have.  I cannot stress this enough- if it doesn't go away in a few days, mastitis needs to be treated by a doctor with antibiotics or it can REALLY mess you up. 

I've gotten very high fevers (105) and landed myself in the ER once trying to treat it on my own.  Ten years of nursing, about 8 cases of mastitis, I was only able to treat two cases at home without antibiotics."

The few times I did leave a bottle for someone else to give, the babies would just refuse and nurse when I got home.  I learned to plan my outings to fit in between feedings.

breastfeeding,fcarhz9,t3_egx2ah,1577575191.0,"Jack Newman always says that if you are safe to handle your baby (i.e. not too drunk to drop them), you are safe to breastfeed.  Alcohol also disperses out of milk at the same rate it does in the blood, so no need to pump and dump.  If you are separated from baby and plan to pump, do it when you're feeling sober.  One drink is definitely fine.  Two is probably all right, the CDC only recommends one though.  You may find that after 9 months of pregnancy and however many months since that your tolerance is lower.  I've been pregnant or nursing for more than 10 years now and can only manage one full sized drink before feeling uncomfortably tipsy.  I usually drink 3 oz servings of wine and if I want 2 I space them out with food."
breastfeeding,fcar6df,t3_egxb5l,1577574992.0,"How is your baby doing?  Are there enough wet/soiled diapers?  If so, your baby may be doing just fine with the supply you have.  What you pump is not a good indication of your supply.

I understand that you want to build a milk stash, but the problem may not be with you, but the pump.  Not every pump is good at getting milk out of every mother.  However, milk is supply and demand, and you may see an improvement if you persist.  Or maybe try a different pump? (maybe not a practical solution)

You may actually have better luck with a middle of the night (2-6 a.m.) pumping session as prolactin levels are highest then, but no guarantees.

I don't have much experience with building a stash, but want to encourage you that you alone may be enough for your baby, as long as you're seeing enough wet/soiled diapers.  If you can nurse lying down, you will be able to rest more at night, just look up safe co-sleeping practices in case you do fall asleep.

If you \*need\* to build up a stash to return to work, hopefully someone with more wisdom can chime in, but in the meantime here are a few ideas:  [www.llli.org](https://www.llli.org) has a good set of message boards, and lots of info.  Also, Jack Newman has lots to say about moms and supply (mostly in regards to latch).  [www.kellymom.com](https://www.kellymom.com) also has tons of great info."
breastfeeding,fcaq4ow,t3_egwu8p,1577574359.0,"Watch the baby, not the clock.  If she is gaining well and producing wet and soiled diapers, she is just becoming more efficient.

You only need to wake a baby to feed them if there is a lack of weight gain and/or wet diapers.  Even at this age.  Enjoy a little sleep while you can, it may not last!!

If you DO have garbage pickup, a good way to start would be to put out the maximum amount every week.  If you do NOT, do you have access to smallish bags (like plastic bags from stores)?  If you have those, maybe start by filling those up and taking one every time you leave the house.  There are trash cans everywhere- gas stations, shopping centers, etc.  Just bring a small bag with you everytime you go somewhere and throw it in a public or meant-for-customers trash can outside.  It might not seem like much, but it would add up over time.  Especially if you are going multiple places and take one bag for each place you go.

I just think that as much flexibility as you can stand to offer without ruining your own life will help maintain your relationship with your siblings if you want that.  That must be super hard.

At the end of the allotted time, everything goes out on the curb and they can pick at it from there or let the garbage company pick it up.  I would also tell them they are expected to pay an equal share for the cost of garbage pickup.
