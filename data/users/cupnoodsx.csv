AskWomen,fej6bb1,t3_epajf6,1579158668.0,"I went to high school with my man and he dated one of my friends while I had a gf (I'm a bisexual woman). We hungout with different kinds of people so we never had chances to really converse or be friends, & I only knew him as the guy my friend was dating. Fast forward to 2017 where we ended up working at the same grocery store where we became best friends. I used to vent about my baby daddy issues while he vented about his ex gf issues. We'd even check out women together & I even helped him try to hit on one of the Starbucks girls. A year later (when I was done dating & wanted to just have fun) some how the conversation of being friends with benefits ignited & I thought that was all it was going to be. Some how it slowly formed to actually wanting more from each other and now we are happily together like it was the first day we confessed our feelings :)"
