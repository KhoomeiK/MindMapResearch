changemyview,fgnkzqg,t1_fgnkmsv,1580947086.0,Those explames are what I and most would consider hate speech which is different. I think subs and people who break rules and say threats should be barred.
changemyview,fgndwu9,t1_fgncr73,1580942804.0,"Well I have a few ideas what reddit could do to help. I know some people don't like it but even I use a extension that flags users who are subbed or have enough krama to certain subs. It also points out trolls. That way I don't waste my time on someone who have 1k krama in a hate sub reddit or someone who have -100 plus down votes in multiple subs. I would like mods to use extensions like that to quickly flag users. 

As a mod you should have rules that you can trigger on the sub or per thread to do things like. 

Don't allow people to comment 
-Who are subbed to people subbed to certain subs. 
-New accounts with in a 1-30 day period
-Accounts considered a troll account (multiple negative comments) in your or other specific reddit
-When threads hit a certain amount of comments with in a certain time the thread slow down the comments and post one every X seconds. Conversations can still happen but at a manageable pace. Most people who are up for a discussion don't mind having it take a day or two and can treat it like an email.  

That's just stuff off the top of my head. I'm sure actual admins or mods of large reddits could give better ideas on useful tools."
changemyview,fgnc43q,t1_fgnb85i,1580941742.0,My main argument is there are better ways to moderate a thread and sub. Some of it on the mods some of it on what reddit should develop.
changemyview,fgnbtrr,t1_fgmx0um,1580941577.0,"I would really like reddit to develop tools to better help mods. Ways for auto flags only mods could see to see troll accounts, post from non subbed users, and even slowing response times for mods. Maybe if a thread hits 500 comments with in X time, every comment from then on gets 5-10 minute delays. It would slow down threads and still allow conversations to exist."
changemyview,fgnbf4s,t1_fgnazhj,1580941341.0,"It is that reddit is becoming worse for a ""redditor"" or how ever you want to call it. Basically as a user who wants to actively comment, vote, and engage in sub reddits."
changemyview,fgnb53v,t1_fgmyh4f,1580941179.0,"Not necessarily. I often don't ""agree"" with safe spaces but I won't stop them or intrude if they are there. I do think there are 100% valid reasons some exist on the internet and in real life. Yet, I think sometimes they are used pretty liberally. 

But if you want to have a forum only for POC, women, people who like anime. Go ahead, I support people doing what makes them happy, but I just don't think reddit best place for a safe space like that when you do exclude others. Specifically when I search the site, see threads and want to comment only to be banned or comment deleted. IMO reddit should be encouraging conversations. At the very least if a thread does exclude it shouldn't be in all or popular."
changemyview,fgnapzt,t1_fgmy6e9,1580940938.0,I think if a thread is locked it is fine to stay up. Since not one person or group is continuing the dialog.
changemyview,fgna9o9,t1_fgmzct3,1580940677.0,"I don't have an issue with that sub. They allow anyone to comment, you just need to source your comment unless it is a follow up question or such."
changemyview,fgna3yv,t1_fgn6fwk,1580940586.0,"Askhistorians a great example of it done right. It is probably my favorite sub, but I don't have to have a flair to post. They have strict rules but anyone can comment as long as the follow those rules."
changemyview,fgmwsy8,t1_fgmunvu,1580933528.0,"Two main reasons for me. 

I just don't think it's a good way to conduit dialog. Most of the subs I'm referencing are dealing with social, racial, gender, or some other serious type of issue. So I believe it just encourages echo chamber and segregation usually isn't an effective tool other than making one side feel better. And in time you sometimes see these subs become more extreme. Almost every ""political"" named sub is extreme to radical. I don't want to call out any specific subs but you see the same for certain social or gender subs on each side of the spectrum. They become a bit toxic when all the doors are remained closed

Second, it just IMO goes against what makes reddit good. Sharing topics, content, stories and then talking about that stuff. Once you start making rules on who can comment or be in a conversation because of biological reasons or sexual preferences I think it goes against what makes the site good. Again if you want safe spaces to talk about these things I just think forums are a better avenue."
changemyview,fgmusa3,t1_fgmu241,1580932455.0,"Well it frustrates me in the moment. I'll not realize what sub I'm in, take 10 minutes to write out a detailed comment and submit. Then, get an auto mail from that subs bot saying the post was deleted. 

I'm not fuming all day about reddit or anything. Like you I use it for a variety of things. This is just one thing that I see slowly eroding one of the reason I use the site. To just challenge my views and talk to people I would otherwise never talk to in person."
changemyview,fgmtsjt,t1_fgms99l,1580931902.0,"Often if I'm not subbed it is because the majority of that community I'm not interested in just a certain thread. BUT it isn't just subbing anymore. Subs are now starting to have mods flair you. You need to prove your a gender or race to post/comment. Or lock popular threads down to only certain flairs. 

My opinion if is your sub is that locked down use a forum, or you sub shouldn't appear in all and popular."
changemyview,fgmth0w,t1_fgmrnj5,1580931716.0,"There are some hobbies people are mocked for enjoying. I'll agree that I don't understand bronies and make jokes at their expense. BUT if they want a forum where they can just talk about the show and not be made fun of all the time I get it go ahead. Same can be true for actual issues with politics, genders, races of people. 

My point though is if you want a safe space, forums are the better option. OR reddit should hide your sub from all or popular if it is locked down."
changemyview,fgmg9uw,t1_fgmdqjs,1580923936.0,"It isn't about making a space mine or even a conversation about me. Often I just want to understand someone position better or explain my position in a reasonable manner. On subs I'm not apart of and comment it is often to just ask a question or give my insight, listen and leave. 

For example one of the 3 post I went to comment today that prompted post was about dating. I didn't realize but it was a dating sub for women. It had a twitter screen cap that essentially said 

""I see looking for something casual"" I send the guy a picture of a V neck. 

Then, the top comment was a girl saying how gross it is to see guys put they just want a casual relationship in their profile or they say that shortly after you get matched. And she isn't their personal flesh light. 

I just wanted to add to the conversation that I thought it was a good thing. I think it is best for everyone if people are honest and upfront about what they want. I think it is better than people leading you onto a relationship only to hook up a couple times and leave. And that wanting sex isn't gross if you're again honest. It is gross to want only sex out of someone when you know they want more. 

Anyways that is an example of what I mean. If she and a lot of women or people think just wanting sex is inherently gross, that is interesting me. I'm not looking to argue with most people online simply hear their side, give mine, and then listen. The main time you see me argue are in specific subs for debate OR if it is just something that is factual wrong or I believe morally wrong."
changemyview,fgm32u7,t1_fglzkn4,1580917035.0,"It isn't mutually exclusive. What I like about reddit is being able to comment or have a discussion on a post. Plenty of post I don't feel the need to, but it is frustrating when I do want to comment (ask questions, educate myself, or just join in the discussion) and I'm unable to."
changemyview,fglvz1e,t1_fglv37h,1580912258.0,"Well the point of my CMV. 

It is becoming pointless to use All and Popular (as a redditor) when this starts becoming the case on more and more sub-reddits. Since it appears this is the way some are dealing with becoming popular. 

Often many of the topics which do pop up I wouldn't discover but when I can't talk about the topics it limits so much. I think it overall hurts reddit and not saying these subs can't exist but that doesn't mean IMO it doesn't hurt the site as the whole if they start becoming the norm. 

I just think a traditional forum is a better outlet for more gated communities online."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fglor0u,t1_fgjymxj,1580906636.0,"I mean if someone just wants sex, what's wrong with that? Wouldn't you rather them be open and upfront about it and not deceive you into a relationship only to get laid a few times and leave it.

Honestly do you think it's gross if a woman on tinder profiles or in chat just mention they aren't looking for anything serious?

Back when I dated online I always wanted people to be honest above all else."
totalwar,fgkjuhh,t1_fgkixr7,1580867238.0,"STW was where I started when I was 10/11. One of my best friends got it for Christmas. I installed it on my family computer and got a no CD crack for it lol. I did end up buying the warlord edition a year or so later.  

A little passion project of mine is to create a video series on each game. Not to review but videos that discuss the game in general (time period, mechanics, development, etc) so been putting a lot of hours into the early titles lately, and putting work into hopefully releasing the first video on STW soon."
totalwar,fgkiojd,t3_ez16x3,1580866460.0,"Been replaying all the Total War games (working on a video series). And during my STW game today, a bug caused all provenience with out standing army to spawn rebels. Pretty ridiculously XD. My last save was an hour prior.

pics,fgfq4yy,t1_fgfeo7e,1580745087.0,"Rome 2 is a good game now. When it launched it was just a buggy mess for a lot of players. They also had some pretty weak mechanics which have since been updated. Specifically the internal politics and how civil wars started. 

The launch version had no family trees, and politics were basically earn points and spend points. The launch version a single civil war would just trigger at some point once you got large enough. Now one triggers if other factions in the system get upset with you, and each province/character has loyalty to a faction. Also say if you have 3 factions in a country like Rome. If one rebelled it wouldn't be a civil war. If you could contain them, but if they went on too long, it would force all other factions to pick a side. Just a lot more dynamic and cool. 

Rome 2 still has some issues, mostly a preference, but the way battle mechanics work IMO are still weaker compared to Rome 1 - Med 2. But it is a good game now."
pics,fgfphhh,t1_fgfl6f9,1580744659.0,"I like a lot about 3k, expect the units are so bland. There isn't a lot of variety from faction to faction and not much overall in the game. Shogun 2 for being just Japan had a few really cool units. A lot of 3k for me is you have spear, sword, cav, crossbow, and archer. In each of those units were is often just a better version. 

I still find myself going back to Rome 2 and shogun 2 the most. I still like Warhammer but really enjoy historical games."

videos,fgbh4s1,t1_fg8lfpv,1580661993.0,"Maybe, the biggest hurdle is the risk a team is taking by drafting or shirting you. If you're under 6ft you need usually 3 things and need ot excel at all. 

1. Be a great shooter
2. Be a great play maker (drawing 2 plus guys to you and pass to someone open)
3. Be great at defense. Whether it is getting steals or just having a insane pace you tire out players you're guarding by giving no space. 

It hard to find smaller guys who excel at all 3, and a team is still taking a change on picking a 5 star 5'3-10'' compared to a 4 star 6' 2-6''. Being tall is just sure a huge advantage in basketball."

pcmasterrace,fg48cs4,t3_ewp44l,1580498305.0,Idk as a pc player I hate cross play. Console aim assist seems to keep getting slightly buffed. Halo Reach was pretty rough imo.
videos,fg08q1a,t3_ew4cui,1580402630.0,"I think that is were people such as myself are concerned about videos like this. I agree, rape and sexual harassment is awful and bad no matter what gender is on either side. But this video is framing things out of context and very binary. And that doesn't mean I disagree with everything. I think many of his examples are good examples of missing the mark, and jokes which are more gross than funny. 

YET, if this was a paper I was grading I would be giving it a D. Because many of their sources are false or out of context. You shouldn't be making arguments and sourcing material if it is incorrect it weakens and hurts the argument, it isn't how you should debate and form a thesis around false evidence. You're also talking about subjective martial and it is hard to declare what is ""good"" and ""bad"".

Like how the video goes into that you shouldn't use rape or sexual assault to get one over on a villain. I of course agree that two wrongs don't make a right. But in fantasy (movies) and reality that doesn't mean it is always black and white. In reality as an American when Bin Laden was killed, I felt good, I felt happy. Yes, I agree you should make people go through trails and we need to follow laws but when I hear the mass shooter or attempted mass shooter was killed by police I'm glad. My point is, if someone is bad enough in a movie it feels good to see them get taught a lesson. 

And who is to say what is worse, murder, rape, etc. How many people cheered when Darth Vader killed the emperor, when hitler gets shot to pieces in inglorious bastards, or any villain of a tv show is killed at the end of the series. These things feel good to most people, even if they reconsign death is wrong. 

Other examples in this video just miss the market because they are fantasy. A lot of men (not all) wish they had very attractive (which most of the women in movies are) wanting to sexually assault them. It is an ego boast. I'm in a very happy relationship, and about once or twice a year I have someone hit on me. I always politely decline and say I have a girl friend, but I won't lie and say being hit on as a man feels extremely good. 

What I think this video is making an assumption incorrectly at is that sexual assault in movies is teaching us how to behave. No healthy minded person watches movies or shows and thinks actions like these are appropriate. It is why there is comedy to people who watch this media. And often the media (almost always be comedies) plays into the man not being effect or others proud of it happening to them. It is a fantasy. 

I also think the video misses the mark because men and women are generally different. I'm all for peoples genders not being their sex and that there are outliers. Some men very well might like to be submissive while certain women like to be in charge in a relationship sexual to social. BUT just because we make a man behave in feminine ways doesn't mean it is an attack on feminine men or women. Like the villain it is funny to see someone who is masculine be put in an awkward position (like with John Wick). Just as it can be comedic to see the opposite. It isn't based on gender but a show like courage the cowardly dog is an example of generating comedy from putting a coward in a leadership role. 

I guess, I just feel that if you make a joke about a serious topic whether it is sexuality, death, race, religion, etc you need to be more considerate to make sure it hits the mark. And sometimes that is subjective. My family often deals with death with comedy, that doesn't mean I will accept a joke about a family members death from a stranger, just because I laughed when my sister said it."
pcmasterrace,ffztv27,t1_ffzrgic,1580392727.0,"It depends, certain manufactures makes better cards, and depending how your PC cooling is can govern how long a card can last. 

With GPU's yes they can just die, but most of the time you get signs it is happening. BOS, graphically glitches, etc... Usually if you get those signs your card is gonna go with in a week or maybe 2. 

Should you be worried? No, the vast majority of cards don't die if your PC isn't running hot all the time. The only mechanically part of the card is the fan. So just make sure the fans sound fine and the bearing aren't going (you can replace fans very cheaply if worried) Just air out the case and fans once a year or every 6 months.

Honestly it is hard to make any hard opinion. If she won't testify and explain who knows what happened. It sounds like there was a sexual encounter of some degree but who knows if it was rape, she wanted attention but he pushed her further than she was willing, or if she just regretted the next day.

RLM isn't that different. It's easier to think ""this is how they really are"" so you feel bad for people like Rich. But I bet if you ask them they would admit there are playing personas of themselves. And they all seem smart enough to realize it is a job and partly acting.

Everyone's plan is the same. Get a quick 5-0/10-1 records and sigh to the UFC or Bellator. Most fighters don't want that tough of fights on the regional level. So if you are good sometimes times the only guys who will fight you are those 2-10 fighters who just show up to scrap."

MMA,feypys9,t1_few32za,1579449056.0,I might be downvoted but it is just my opinion. I dont think he has a lot of heart. He has a tendency (like many fighters) to look for a way out.
Whatcouldgowrong,feyc6em,t1_fex46o3,1579443608.0,"The secret to customer service is you just check your ego at the door to work and don't give a fuck in the best way possible. You know it's not worth it to let people anger you or get to you.

Not everyone can do it but just dont take things personal and with anger people learn to get joy out of killing them with kindness."
MMA,feubwy6,t3_eqgbdw,1579385098.0,"Do only what feel comfortable going into your first fight. Listen to your corner, it will probably be loud but try to pick on their voice. DON'T look at your corner. Many new fighters often make this mistake. 

Most important IMO, is keep a clear head. Leading up to the fight stay loose, conserve energy. Get a warm up going just enough to where you're about to sweat but not. 

Good Luck"

todayilearned,femwo2f,t1_femtl6s,1579271562.0,"I mean that guy was very anti technology, that was his main MO. Who knows but I imagine him not ever wanting to use a computer. He didn't even have eclectic or running water in his cabin."
todayilearned,femwfx8,t1_femtjco,1579271394.0,"I mean he was basically caught because before the bombings he sent his brother an essay that was very similar to the manifesto. When the manifesto came out his brother who started to have worries that Ted could be the bomber (because of possible ties to the Chicago area) read the manifesto and realized it sounded a lot like his brother. 

He then found the old letters his brother and hired a P.I. to investigate. The P.I. concluded that the manifesto and letter likely were from the same author because of common phrases and misspellings. Then, they contacted the FBI."

WorldOfWarships,fegreem,t1_fefrvxq,1579100768.0,"It's been years so I dont remember the details. But one of his friends apparently died on his property. I believe the feds thought there was something shady about the death so ended hitting him with drug possession on a raid.

I think he got out of legal trouble now but can't own weapons anymore."
PublicFreakout,fee71us,t1_fednfcz,1579027729.0,I bet every day was still worth it. But yeah it's fucked. I'm all for justice but killing a baby and getting only 25 isn't justice it just a process.

PublicFreakout,fec7wsy,t1_fec7het,1578968192.0,"Well my point to the person above is. Absolutely never pull a gun unless you're willing to kill what your target is. And you never are concerned about anything other than stopping that threat or target. 

You almost never trained to aim to wound. There are very few expectations to that rule. But first self defense, police, or military the vast majority of time you're trained to hit center mass. That's it."
PublicFreakout,fec6ov6,t1_fec4ocj,1578967563.0,"No, period.

If you ever pull a gun on someone you should only do it IF IF IF you're in fear of your life. It someone with a group of 9 friends is approaching you on your property and refuses to stop I truly believe anyone might fear for their life (with videos like this to give context to how he would be haming it up).

So if you do pull the weapon your goal in self defense is simple. You eliminate the threat quickly and violently. You can often discharge an entire magazine in 1 to 3 seconds especially if panicked or scared.

The long and shot of it is, if you feel you need to defend your life don't think about aiming for the legs, don't think about the possible court and litigations, don't be concerned about the how the other persons family will feel. Because if you hesitate you might be dead. You aim and shoot as many times as needed until the threat has ceased. 

Which is why you never never never draw and aim that weapon unless your truly in fear for you life. And again in context of how this guy probably goes very ham, looks intimidating, and had a crew with him I cant see how you could be in fear of you life."
MMA,fe80wdy,t3_enwr3e,1578921125.0,"Forest is one of my favorite people in the UFC. Such a fun fighter to watch and just a ""real"" person. I also love the story on how Dana gave him a job go basically do nothing like he did for a few other legends like Chuck. But forest wasn't content just getting paid and kept finding work to do. So when the UFC sold he was the only one of those guys to stay on payroll."
PublicFreakout,fe7ewj4,t1_fe6mz6o,1578913665.0,"100% agreed what most all lives matter type people don't realize is they are protesting someone else's protest. 

It's no different than going to a charity for children's cancer and outside the event asking for money to fund your concert trip because your parents won't lend you money. There is nothing wrong with asking for money money but it is incredibly poor taste to do it their and for a cause that isn't a need."
gaming,fe6gdjc,t1_fe6g3j2,1578890083.0,"Lol okay great way to handle criticism. Not saying you need to agree, what I stated I literally said was my opinion not fact. I hope you're not as sensitive about discussing serious subjects.

Idk why but in the last week or so I've seen more and more people on reddit announcing that they have blocked you.

Does anyone know if this is a new trend? It just seems weird but I suppose it is a why to feel like you got the last word in?"
gaming,fe63t45,t1_fe5zcz3,1578881158.0,I replayed 1 back in 2016 and I was pretty sure the game said you have x days (150 I think) to complete the main task. I might be misremembering though

boardgames,fdzjyhi,t1_fdyfhko,1578790887.0,"Yes. But it can't always be about you or the person in question.

Some games are simply tainted or have bad experiences if one player simply just plays to play but for what ever reason just can't play at a reasonable level.

For example I'm picky about who I play certain games with such as table top 40k. I'll play and teach new players but if someone doesn't get it after a certain time I'm just not going to invite them to those types of game nights."
Grimdank,fdun7p6,t1_fdumyjk,1578735665.0,Sure. But I'm just pointing out why people think the first order storm troopers are crap. The most prominent part of Star Wars shows them in a crap light.
Grimdank,fdumtuh,t1_fduhgy9,1578735468.0,"People shit on them because they are almost always shown to be cannon fodder in movies. And you can argue about the movies, but they are lore and get the most eyes on them.

It's like wwe telling us X wrestler is a threat and to be feared but you seem them get starched 4 matches in a row. After so long I simply won't buy it as a viewer.

Almost every star wars movie has shown storm troopers are fodder, even the first order. No spoilers but the recent movie has a scene just like almost every other movie which implies they are just basic troopers not to be feared by heroes."
