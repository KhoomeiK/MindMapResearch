However your comment and everybody else’s has encouraged me to stand up for myself. It’s worth a try and if my dad stop taking me, i guess it’s nice knowing that I stood up for myself."
exjw,ffmktsm,t1_ffmiwt6,1580056013.0,I’m 18. I’ve told my parents countless times that I feel uncomfortable with them being in the room but my parents told me that they need to know everything I say to my therapist. And there’s nothing really I can do. They pay for my therapy and so if I don’t comply they can make me not go anymore. I tried getting a job to pay for my own therapy but they said no. My case is useless. There’s nothing I can do. The only thing I can possibly do is tell my therapist but I can imagine it going south.
exjw,ffmgkhu,t1_ffmftqm,1580054344.0,That’s the thing. It’s not a safe space because my parents won’t allow me to talk to my therapist alone. Which is why I feel like it’s a waste of time.
exjw,ffdfnwm,t3_esyz2b,1579819886.0,I’m not in the Yorkshire area how I consider myself bisexual. You can talk to me if you want.
exjw,fe2lo02,t3_ennnfl,1578840066.0,"I can only imagine how you’re feeling. It’s a rough spot to be in. I can really relate with what you’re going through. At the end of the day, we have to ask ourselves, are we willing to put up the fight to achieve our own happiness and freedom. I know it’s going to be a really really hard fight. No one shouldn’t have to choose between their parents or their own happiness. I’m sorry you’re going through this. Keep your head up, this isn’t going to last forever. It’ll get better."

depression,fct723o,t1_fct50u9,1577934575.0,I have a hard time vocally expressing myself. Would it be okay if I write it down and hand it to them?

depression,fck600t,t1_fcjr2ys,1577717568.0,"No thanking for sharing. Any types of relapse can be really hard. I can’t imagine how hard it is to want to ween off of drugs but the urges of wanting to take them is beating you down. What I got from all of these comments is that if you relapse, to not be hard on yourself. The race doesn’t stop when you do. It continues. And so continue being strong and try weening off of it by doing it little by little with greater incriminates (days) in between. I believe in you and you have a community here to support you whenever times get hard for you. I believe in you, you got this!!!"
depression,fcizugg,t1_fciy2gy,1577673787.0,"I really appreciate your comment. Also thank you for taking the time to see what I’m all about. I do foresee my future in a more optimistic way. And I do accept that they’ll be ups and downs. Right now, I’m just trying to fight through the negative thoughts and emotions that tries to push me down. Hopefully one day I can break free from this depression. Thank you once again, I wish you a happy new year!!!"
