illnessfakersgonewild,feotfrv,t3_eq68ig,1579305166.0,That's a cheap knock-off bulldog harness and its not even on correctly.  This is what happens when people that read 50 Shades of Gray try to pretend they understand BDSM.
UnethicalLifeProTips,femhbf3,t3_epxd8l,1579255530.0,"I preboard because of a legitimate disability, it saves maybe 5 minutes. Preboarding also means you get off the plane last which wastes on average 20-45 minutes. So by all means, waste your own time buddy."

rarepuppers,fecus53,t1_fectds8,1578985441.0,"Early neurological stimulation starts at 3 days old and is most important between those first 3 to 16 days. The techniques aim to expose puppies to movements and sensations not experienced naturally in that span of life to kickstart neurological development. There is a guide that can be found if you just google that, but caution that over stimulation of the neurological system can have adverse and detrimental results so please if you do want to try these techniques read carefully."

dogswithjobs,fe95ttj,t1_fe8qeix,1578934576.0,"In service dog terms a medical detection is performed through scent, also called medical alert.

To clarify- a medical alert must occur before symptoms present. The idea is the give the handler advanced noticed to a condition like low blood sugar, impending seizure, or impending anxiety attack. Alerting when the event is already occurring, such as what this dog is doing, would be like a seizure alert dog letting them know theyre having a seizure while theyre flopping around on the floor, not very helpful."
dogswithjobs,fe8g11n,t1_fe8dsby,1578925775.0,"Yeah the video with sound shows exactly what I expected. This is a response task not a detection. Detection would be alerting to the rise in cortisol before these symptoms occur. This dog is just responding to the occurrence, specially hands to face(crying), hands together(usually picking or other self harm behaviors) and distressed noises. Anxiety response tasks can be just as helpful but not the same thing as a scentwork detection task. And really the last thing anyone that’s having a cluster of severe panic attacks in a crowded airport would want to do is set up a camera :/ the whole thing hits many red flags"
dogswithjobs,fe79hza,t3_eo254l,1578911713.0,"Without sound I’m skeptical the dog is “detecting the anxiety” and not just responding to the sad noise the handler makes. This video is obviously a purposeful demonstration so for the dog to be detecting the smell of cortisol there would need to be a sample present on the handler, however the dog does not “detect” until the handler begins acting distressed. This is an anxiety response task, not a detection."
puppy101,fduvc88,t1_fduufh6,1578739428.0,Yeah if he’s doing alright just roll with it. Sometimes in the winter where I live potty training puppies can be a pain (I train service dogs and we have lots of puppies around) they don’t always want to be outside and tend to clam up in the cold and not potty and sometimes that becomes refusing to go outside at all at night. If he’s willing and happy to go and not crying he seems fine.
puppy101,fduukyj,t3_en40vr,1578739075.0,"How quickly are you switching between foods? Very slowly tapering into a new food is important especially for puppy tummies. Aside from that, adding puréed pumpkin can help regulate stools as a great source of soluble fiber. The cheap easy canned pumpkin with nothing else added can also be great to stuff in a kong and freeze for entertainment."
puppy101,fdutpp2,t3_en5qy8,1578738676.0,"Has anything else changed about his energy level or how much he’s drinking? Puppies generally can hold their bladder for an hour longer than months they are old, however this drastically increases when they’re just sleeping. If you find he pees upon waking before you can get him outside in the morning than yeah you might want to empty him halfway through the night but as long as nothing else has changed, enjoy the easy potty training!"

mildlyinfuriating,fdipayq,t1_fdinhi9,1578448003.0,With the tomato based things like pasta sauces on lasagna I would assume it’s the acidy of the tomatoes that eats through the foil
mildlyinfuriating,fdine0r,t3_ellas9,1578446781.0,I’ve had that happen with tomato based foods before but odd it happened with mac and cheese. I’ve made it a habit to always put plastic wrap over something before covering it for the fridge overnight. Works great unless you forget to take the plastic wrap off before putting it in the oven...
illnessfakersgonewild,fdg7gx5,t1_fdg6rrh,1578383193.0,"I mean, not entirely true. Many family members are paid to care for their sick/disabled child, sibling, parent etc. the exception to these programs is that you can’t be paid to care for the person you’re legally married to. I doubt that’s what Ren is doing though, those programs require training for both parties and I’m sure they would have announced that they got a legit tax paying job much sooner."

aww,fd985sm,t1_fd93xbf,1578229757.0,"You say that like puppies don’t also chew on shoes, couches, wires, chair legs etc. the puppy literally will use every item in your house as a toy and when they access those inappropriate items they are made inaccessible or discouraged from being played with. Putting one of those items into a bedding area to be played with and then later scolding the puppy for chewing on your socks is an externally common accidental training. This is something I deal with weekly as a professional dog trainer. I’m not criticizing you for taking the advice you didn’t know was bad advice, I’m advising you as a behavioral specialist that this is a bad idea and a veterinarian is not equipped to give you training advice. The vet may be able to assist you in removing the stick from your ass though."
aww,fd8yxm3,t1_fd8wypw,1578225596.0,That’s a fantastic way to teach a puppy to treat your clothing items as toys.

dogswithjobs,fbyru85,t1_fbypafo,1577224644.0,It is a violation and the company has been made aware of that and are taking action to educate their staff.
