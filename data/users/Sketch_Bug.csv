Before? What if you play all three notes at the same time?

I was going to say nevermind, but you're in luck since it's in the image that wikipedia gives for their figured bass article. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figured_bass

> Is figured bass the same thing as slash chords?

No. This came up in your other thread too. You're trying to combine two completely different notation systems that weren't designed to work with each other. One of them is lead sheet notation and the other one is figured bass. The little 6s and 4s you're confused about are figured bass.

> And would you ever write in a sheet music for example C6/4 to mean second inversion, or would you simple write C/G?

If I were giving the music to musicians who were accustomed to Baroque music, I would write I^6/4 (or even leave off the roman numeral) below the staff, using roman numeral / figured bass notation. If I were giving it to musicians accustomed to playing jazz or pop, I would write C/G using the chord symbols that lead sheets use. Under no circumstance would I write C^6/4 even though a lot of people could probably guess what I mean if they had experience with both notation systems.

EDIT: I forgot to explain what a suspension was. Say you have two chords, E going to B (always working in C major is a mistake by the way). A suspension is when you hold some of the notes from the first chord over before resolving them downward to the next chord. Usually it's a suspended 4th (so holding the note E while the other 2 notes of the B chord are playing, and then resolving that E down to D#). The music will have a little 4 - 3 in it to show that. In lead sheets, they just write sus4 instead.

Here's an example. At 1:36 is the suspension, and 1:39 is the resolution downward. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2r1iesThvYg

I didn't want to explain that because it seems like you need to know some of the other stuff first, but I also shouldn't leave you hanging.

In fact, I^6/4 to V is oftentimes really just a special kind of suspension and older theorists used to call it such."

musictheory,ffq6dy2,t3_eumeqz,1580122951.0,"Less importantly: 6 4, not 4 6. You say it as ""six four.""

But to actually answer your question, it still makes sense either way because G is in the bass, and there's a 6th (E) and 4th (C) above it. Figured bass generally ignores octave displacement. 

It might help (or might make things worse) to know that root position chords are technically 5 3 chords, but that's generally understood so it gets left off of figured bass unless there's a suspension or something beforehand.

So I^6/4 does always mean I in second inversion, with the 5th always in the bass (or else it's not second inversion, as you said).

So melodies and text is normally what is considered theft. But the Blurred Lines case is the first that I can find that doesn’t meet that threshold.

So let me go through your wikipedia examples one at a time since you're too much of a dumb fuck to use your words.

> In 1973, ""Come Together"" was the subject of a lawsuit brought against Lennon by Big Seven Music Corp. (owned by Morris Levy) who was the publisher of Chuck Berry's ""You Can't Catch Me"". Levy contended that it sounded similar musically to Berry's original and shared some lyrics (Lennon sang ""Here come ol' flattop, he come groovin' up slowly"" and Berry's had sung ""Here come a flattop, he was movin' up with me"").

This is melody and text, like the other guy said.

> While comparing the two compositions, author and musicologist Dominic Pedler writes that both songs have a three-syllable title refrain (""My sweet Lord"", ""He's so fine"") followed by a 5-3-2 descent of the major scale in the tonic key

Melody.

> Despite tensions with Berry over the controversy at the time,[clarification needed] Carl Wilson said the Beach Boys ""ran into Chuck Berry in Copenhagen and he told us he loves 'Surfin' U.S.A.'.""[7] 

Oh for fuck's sake, there wasn't even a lawsuit on this one. Do your research before spamming a bunch of wikipedia links."
todayilearned,ffkdsam,t1_ffk2w0i,1580021109.0,"*tldr, they're more similar than you say but I still don't think Pharrell should have lost that one.*

I'm a professional musician but you're probably better off asking a lawyer.

Usually the lawsuits care about copying the distinct identifying elements of a song. So usually the melody, but sometimes a bassline or drum fill. People have been sued for sampling a single chord before too. This is usually because they copied something **exactly** or at least exact enough that it was obvious.

On the other hand, we have a Pharrell song here that's similar to a Gaye song in a few ways, but doesn't seem to have copied any of the *important* elements exactly.

The backing percussion has a very similar (not the same) rhythm and instrumentation, which ordinarily is not enough for a lawsuit. The bass rhythm is also close, but Pharrell didn't follow the same set of changes as Gaye so really, who gives a shit?

Most importantly (and this is never in the worthless comparison videos because they give you 30s of a 10 minute Marvin Gaye song), the harmony on lines like ""good girl"" and ""blurred lines"" is pretty distinct and is copied from the backup singers in Got To Give It Up, about 5 minutes into the track. But we're still talking about a supporting figure, and not a melody.

But.... Copying nonmelodic content is a huge part of music and is more or less why songs have genres. And this lawsuit was in no way consistent with the views of the rest of the industry. I mean, Queen/Bowie lost their suit with Vanilla Ice and that was 100% a bastardization of their song. 

If something like Blurred Lines is actionable, then why don't The Black Keys get sued for aping Led Zeppelin? Or why doesn't Bob Dylan get sued for writing the same Delta blues type of progressions for what, 60 years now? Why didn't George Thorogood get sued for copying Chuck Berry's style? Instead, they were friends! What a dope that Chuck Berry was, befriending someone with a similar style instead of trying to exploit them! Why doesn't Dream Theater get sued for all the Pink Floyd shit they hid in Octovarium? And I've got more, believe me.

So yeah, I do think it's kind of bullshit that the Marvin Gaye's estate or whoever won that suit, and I say that as someone who greatly prefers the original Marvin Gaye song and I say it despite thinking Pharrell is an asshole. Litigation like that stifles the creativity of musicians who borrow from other musicians, which is basically all of us. It's simply the best way to learn to write. And I am 99% certain the real Marvin Gaye wouldn't give a shit.

Didn't expect this to go on for so long but I guess I got triggered. Incidentally, I used the exact 3 chord changes from Got To Give It Up and no one has come knocking yet.

edit: To make this even longer, I decided to search my favorite music subreddit to see what other musicians think and most of us are on the same page.

Terry is the only dlc character (ever) who I didn't know by name, but even then I was eventually like ""Oh it's that one KoF guy."" KoF has been around forever and there are like 30 games. 

Dragon Quest never really caught on in the west but DQ3 Hero is nearly as well known as Mario in Japan, and anyone who is even remotely interested in JRPGs knows about it.

And then Joker and Byleth are from recent games that you just have to be generally paying attention to know about.

So oddly enough, I feel like the obscure character is Banjo (or Kazooie as we should say since she does all the work). B-K is a cult classic and a really good platformer, especially for its day, but isn't it basically a dead franchise? Years before the announcement, I told some of my friends Banjo was too obscure for Smash.

Similarly, if you cut a ""string"" in half, it is no longer the same string. ""You've"" changed it, and its sound is also going to change.

Yeah, particularly if you go by the old meaning of ""natural philosophy,"" known today as **science**.

> The frequency of a vibrating string is inherently dependent on its tension. You literally cannot have resonant vibration of a string with zero tension, that’s just physics. In the above example of the dangling string, the tension is supplied by gravity.

This is circular reasoning because you've defined a string as an object that has tension applied it. Other bodies have fundamental frequencies despite not being strings and not being under tension.

Or if you want a more sarcastic answer, it looks like the fundamental frequency in the scenario you describe is zero.

> So you agree with me that it doesn’t make sense to say that a string or horn has one specific fundamental frequency, because that frequency can be altered!

Ah right. It doesn't make any sense to say that I have two apples in my fridge because I could go eat one of them and then I wouldn't have two apples anymore. It doesn't make sense to say that Scarlett Johannson has blonde hair because she could dye it later, and it won't be blonde anymore. It doesn't make any sense to say that a 50lb weight weighs 50lbs because you could take it to the moon. Things could be different, therefore they are different. There is no such thing as truth.

Anyway, if I agree with you, I'll tell you. In the meantime, let me know if you change your mind and decide to debate in good faith.

edit: Just in case you're not trolling, the difference in our beliefs has already been covered.

> You might be thinking to reply that the difference is a matter of semantics, but it isn't. It is strictly incorrect to say that vocalists don't have a fundamental, because then what you're actually saying is that vocalists don't exist.

Your position is that bodies of mass have fundamental frequencies but that it ""doesn't make sense"" to say so."
FL_Studio,fecs43h,t1_feb6xwd,1578982507.0,"BTW op, kuromarumusic can probably tell you don't know theory because of your word choices. I mean this 100% seriously and not insultingly. One of the best things theory does is gives you the language to describe stuff with greater precision. 

In turn, you can express the difference between your music and the stuff you want to sound like, which makes it easier to ask questions like this & understand the answers you get. We actually have no clue what your music sounds like based on what you've told us so far, so we can't really tell you what is wrong with it.

What do I mean? Maybe -- and these are just examples since idk your music -- you'll come to find out that your drums aren't ""stale,"" but they're too straight and need to shuffle instead. Or your melodies aren't ""boring,"" but they're diatonic and need more notes from outside the scale. Or the sounds aren't ""boring"" but there's not enough timbral variety. Again, these are just examples of what the problems and solutions *could* be.

In other words, learning theory will make it easier to pinpoint what *exactly* sounds stale or boring."
