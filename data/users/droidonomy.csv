It happens [about 10% of the time](https://drrobertlaprademd.com/revision-acl-reconstruction-acl-graft-failure-acl-knee-surgery-vail-denver-colorado/), though I'm sure a top sports team uses the best surgeons available and you're right, it's rare for these surgeries to be unsuccessful in footballers.

It's important to understand how far modern medicine has come in terms of dealing with these kinds of injuries.

Besides, we've hardly regretted selling Caldara because he's played like 5 minutes of football in 2 years (though of course nobody knows what would have happened if he stayed) and Bonucci has been good. Also we ended up getting Higuain back and he's been amazing. It was as bit of a happy accident in the end since Higgy basically dug in his heels and refused to leave, but ending up with Higuain, Ronaldo and Bonucci at the cost of Caldara is a no-brainer.

>I'm not being overly romantic at all, this club was built on that foundation, that's why we had so many world class players stay when we got relegated.

All I'm saying is that this isn't the first time players have been unceremoniously offloaded. Sure the club has become somewhat more ruthless in recent years because the reality of today's game is that it's cold and calculating, but I don't understand why you're holding up Caldara as the shining example of the club losing its heart and soul.
