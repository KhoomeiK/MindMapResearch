"" please make way for the special invented armor mental protection when reality is raging harder"" 

It's progressive and has some heavier moments, I enjoy listening to it when I feel like i'm literally swinging back and forth and going to explode.

BPD,fc4ge8v,t3_eg0r9x,1577415895.0,"As someone who struggles with these types of emotions in similar situations I understand how you feel. I have noticed with my BF he's ignorant when it comes to listening and  / or details. DIDN""T even notice when our SIL cut her hair from her waist to her shoulders.. smh. I think as people with BPD we pay attention to details in a  very hyperactive way, I think men don't. He had good intentions and there should absolute be gratitude for the gifts, which I am sure you have, as I have had relationships in the past where my bf has gifted me nothing. Maybe you can find a way to calmly approach the topic, give it a couple days to let the fog settle ? Sometimes I've had success in saying things like

 ""I know you really really meant well and absolutely appreciate what you've done for me, however it kind of my hurt of my feelings that you didn't remember the bad experience I had at this massage place. I know you weren't trying to upset me and I just wanted to express my point of view so you didn't think I was ungrateful or upset with you.""

I don't know... sometimes I can express the chaos inside of my head without offending my bf... sometimes I'm too blunt and I do. I hop e this helps you"
alone,fc4fgu2,t1_fc4f5sh,1577415131.0,"i've been before, they kept me for 8 days,  I went in voluntarily. IT was awful and I still have nightmares. The holding cell they kept me in for 48 hours was terrible and I was never even offered one meal in that 48 hours, they just kept sedating me. I don't take drugs, so I was not on drugs when I arrived, nor I was I self harming, I was depressed and wanted to die.  I wish I had a different choice than that one, but others are just so far from me. but I will go I  promise."
BPD,fc4dqos,t1_fc4dddq,1577413710.0,"thank you for your response, I have done intense research on all forms of mental health issues that relate to what I struggle with. Beyond that I have watched many videos on diagnoses and misdiagnoses, as well as what things people were struggling with while dealing with this. I have purchased numerous books upon BPD specifically and have NEVER felt more understood in my entire life while reading these books. As my post states  I do want to go to the hospital."
