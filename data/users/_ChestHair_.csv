>Fatalism/Free will isn't a uniquely christian problem, it exists in all belief systems. ""You are just the consequence of your DNA trying to pass itself on""

I never said it was. I just take issue with people laughing at the silly mormons and then solemnly eating their god-in-cracker-form an hour later. They're all ridiculous to varying degrees; mormonism being a 9 and christianity being a 7 isn't all that much of a difference

>Regarding Free Will/Determinism from a Christian perspective: The Bible states very clearly that Men and women do have very real choice, and those choices have consequences.

It doesn't matter if it says they have a choice if it also says god knows what you're going to do, that's the point I'm making. It's not a choice if the choice is known ahead of time. The two ideas 100% can not mix. So it existing in the bible is silly

>Regarding not stopping the devil; the bible states God will come again and stop the devil and his evil once and for all. That the devil has power now for an appointed time. That the devil's existence is the result of the devils choice to deny God.

Fair.

>Regarding making people just to send them to hell; this again is very clearly disputed in the bible; it says when Jesus came and revealed the way to God Jesus went to those who had died before just to give them a chance to hear the good news (obviously you cant make of this what you will but the heart of the matter is there)

This still stems back to the oxymoron of people having a choice but god knowing what you'll choose before you actually do

>It also explicitly states God takes no joy in the destruction of wicked.

The problem is that if god knows what you'll do, he's intentionally making wicked people just to destroy them. That's more childish than a literal child lighting ants on fire"

John 6:54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.

It doesn't really matter *why* they're doing it, as that's not the topic I brought up. The *what* of the topic is what I brought up.

>You can think whatever you want to think but being unrealistic about other people's beliefs doesn't help anything except to promote more division.

Alright how about we bring up the topic of free will. Christianity states we have free will. But God knows what we're going to do before we do it. That's fate, and if someone knows our choices ahead of time, then no choice was actually made, because the choice is already known. It'd be like saying a calculator has a choice in what it spits out when you type 2+2 into it. Free will would mean absolute certainty in choices is not possible.

And God is all powerful, but can't stop the devil, because... Or God creates people he knows will sin, and thus literally makes specific people knowing the end result will be torture for eternity. Or people who are slaves are instructed to be good slaves. But he definitely loves us because we eat crackers and pray to him; just ignore all those other things.
