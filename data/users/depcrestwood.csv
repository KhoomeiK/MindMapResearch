You can still get into college with undiagnosed ADHD (I even managed to make it on the dean's list (honor role, basically) my last semester in college), but again, it comes at the cost of a lot of undue frustration.  

I was 37 when I was diagnosed and prescribed medication for it.  And my only regret has been waiting so long to do it.  My daughter was diagnosed and prescribed medication when she was 7, and all the problems she was experiencing in school (which I recognized as problems I had in school when I was her age, which is why I took her to see a doctor) vanished almost overnight.  

I don't know where you're from or what the medication issues might be, but it couldn't hurt to at least see if you can get a diagnosis.

insanepeoplefacebook,fesmlsu,t1_fesk90u,1579366832.0,"I'm not saying there aren't asshole cops, but I am saying they tend to get away with it because they're following procedure when doing it.

Policing is a job.  You ever see a job that didn't have an asshole working there?  It's more pronounced because of the nature of law enforcement and its impact on society, but some people seem to think that cops should be able turn off their humanity while remaining humane to do it.

Makes it a lot easier to weed out the bad eggs if they didn't have a means to justify their actions.  Also makes it easier if there wasn't such an overwhelming need for police to boost their numbers by any means necessary, but that would mean society restructuring itself so that poverty doesn't exist on such a wide scale and education isn't an afterthought in budget hearings.  

But generalizing every cop as a bad guy when most of us are regular people who just want to do a job and go home at the end of the day isn't how you can help start the change.  You're doing the same thing that you're accusing cops of doing.  That's not helping."

MadeMeSmile,fekb5gw,t1_fej0flk,1579196376.0,"I hope you were able to grow from the experience to come out stronger.  It's a shame that some parents see their role as a dominant authority figure and try to parent like a warden.  Parenting without being overbearing is more effective and less stressful for both parties involved.  Parents are supposed to be guides, not bosses.  It should go without saying that abuse in any form shouldn't enter the picture at all.

I was always one of the bigger kids growing up, and my parents were afraid that if I got physical with anyone I'd end up hurting them.  So they suppressed my instincts to stand up for myself in any fashion.  I also never would have gotten away with verbally jabbing back at them.  My propensity for sarcasm was not appreciated or encouraged.  (I was forbidden from watching The Simpsons for fear I'd want to take notes from Bart.)  That is not to say they were bad parents ... they were just new to the job. I wasn't their biological son; they were my aunt and uncle who took over my care when I was 6, which could not have been easy for them since they were childless at the time.  My birth parents tended to have a wild streak that could easily end with them on the wrong side of the law, and they didn't teach me much in the way of civility during the time I grew up with them.  So in their own way, my aunt and uncle were trying to protect me from my own genetics, and considering how my brother turned out (he was raised by a different relative), they probably did me a big favor in that regard.

That being said, I ended up an easy target for bullies, and I spent a lot of time frustrated by my imposed limitations.  I've never been good at ""fitting in"" and I had undiagnosed and untreated ADHD (the 80's didn't really believe in it).  At a catholic school, the inability to conform was seen as a weakness that even the teachers would pounce on.  So I had it coming from all sides.

It took a long time for me to learn how to stand up for myself, and longer to learn how to shove back (verbally and mentally) when someone shoved me.  It wasn't an easy road, and I remember that.  I would rather my daughter grow up with a ready arsenal than have to suffer and hope she builds her own.  It's going to be hard enough for her the further she goes, and I want her to be the person she wants to be, not what she thinks others want her to be.  I especially started encouraging her to beef up her defenses when she started taking an interest in gaming.  Eventually she'll come into contact with online gamers, and while most are pretty chill, she's going to have to deal with the inevitable misogyny, and I want her to be able to come out swinging.  When she hits the age to start messing with social media, I want her to be able to ignore whatever people might say about her online and understand that their opinions do not matter because they're only projecting their own insecurities from the freedom of basic anonymity.

At the same time, we do have to teach her to respect people and their differences (up to a certain point ... since some people would try to take advantage of that), and it's a weird line to walk.  But so far, she's done mostly okay with it.  She has her mother's temper, so I have to work a bit harder when it comes to teaching her how to control it.  But she's only 10 now, so I have some time."

MadeMeSmile,feiisbn,t3_epbdud,1579139496.0,"So when my daughter was at the age of learning how to write, I used to go in her room every morning to drag her out of bed to get ready for school.  In a tradition handed down from my parents, I would sometimes be fairly annoying - singing little made-up nonsense songs or tickling her feet or whatever - until she finally relented sleep and got up to meet the day.

One morning she was being particularly stubborn about getting up, so my second time going in I started ramping up the nuisance factor until she finally sat up.  My third time checking on her, I found her still in bed with the covers pulled all the way up over her.  When I started in with loud noises and singing, a single tiny hand poked up from under her covers holding an index card with something scribbled in pencil on it.

I took that card and found that the scribble was a word.

""Asshole.""  Written in the over-sized and unsteady scrawl of a tired 1st grader.

Now, I know that wasn't *supposed* to be a ""proud papa"" moment, but I still carry that index card in my wallet.  The pencil has since faded away, but it's okay because I know what was there.

The surgery itself went fine, but the intern closing me up nicked my carotid artery and they had to open me back up to fix it. I was under so long that half of my right lung collapsed.

Of course, I didn't know any of this. I went under in the morning, expecting to wake back up just as it was getting dark. When I did wake up, the first thing I noticed was the clock on the wall in front of me said 8 o'clock, and that there was sunlight coming through the window. It being November, I knew that had to be wrong. (Don't ask me how I was that coherent after basically being comatose, it just happened that way.)There were people milling about the room, so I tried to ask what was going on.

That's when I found out there was a tube down my throat. So I panicked and tried to reach for it.

That's when I found out my hands were strapped down.

I was fine up until that point, but I flew into an uncharacteristic Hulk-mode rage and immediately tried to tear the hospital down around me so I could get the tube out of my throat. The medical staff noticed and tried to calm me down, and one unfortunate male nurse got a look from me that promised death to his entire family if he didn't get the goddam tube out of my throat.

He complied, and was fortunate that I was too weak to break out of the restraints because I was hell bent on strangling him until the job was done.

As much as epic fantasy stories are my jam, and as much as I loved reading The Hobbit (not so much the movie versions), I was never able to make it more than halfway through Fellowship before having to stop.  But the movies were excellent.

So I would amend my statement to say most of the time.  However, Clerks was not based on a book, and so it is a moot point.  But movies, for various reasons, often skip over important details in the story that books keep, allowing for deeper and richer story.

To throw out a reverse example: I loved the original TMNT and Batman (Keaton) movies when they came out, but I found the novelizations of the movies to be more fulfilling."

Most of the comic relief is done through the side characters instead of carried by Okabe's witticisms.  The dynamic of the original group is pretty much shattered, though a lot of the season focuses on rebuilding the friendships.

However, the build-up to the end is worth it (in my opinion), and the mad scientist persona does come back to save the day (sort of).  It ends up being as cleverly plotted out as the first.

It is kind of weird getting used to depressed Okabe (versus traumatized Okabe from the original), but the payoff for it does feel good when it comes full circle.  I'd say give it two or three more episodes before really giving up on it, and just know that towards the end it gets pretty crazy."

But then my parents bought me the Chronicles of Prydain series (by Lloyd Alexander) and I found out how much story was left out of the movie.  The movie itself sort of meshes together bits and pieces of the first two books, focusing mainly on the second book which is also titled The Black Cauldron, and I always found the story got so much better in the last three books, which were completely ignored.  I've only watched The Black Cauldron a couple of times, but I lost count of how many times I read the book series all the way through."
