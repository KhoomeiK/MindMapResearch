comicbooks,ffwcshu,t1_ffw9vvj,1580295710.0,"Saying that she is a teen isn't a very valid argument here, as she is not supposed to be a regular teen at all. 

I understand and agree with you that changes happen in adaptations and I hated all the changes you mentioned as well. 

I just don't see a point calling her Cassandra if she is Cassandra in name only. They could have called her anything else.

I guess, I just have to make my peace with it, and hope in the future we get as awesome animated Bat family movie with comic accurate Cassandra in it."
comicbooks,ffw99if,t1_ffw8u7g,1580290604.0,"Deadshot, Harley and Waller - All of these characters retained atleast their core in the adaptation. 

Deadshot is a hitman who cares for his daughter. His race doesnt matter. 

Harley is a psychiatrist that got turned by the joker and goes crazy. Her costumes don't matter.

Waller is badass that gives no fucks and is ready to kill anyone to achieve her goals. Her body type doesn't matter. 

Cassandra entire schitck is that she was bought up to be an assassin since birth. Her slowly becoming part of Bat family and becoming normal human while interacting with the rest of the family especially Babs is one of my favourite comic arcs. 

I just sad we won't get to see that, as she is my favourite Batgirl after Babs.

I do agree that her costume is often skintight and sexualised in the comics. But, there are other great costume they could have gone with for the adaptation that might fit with the aesthetic and theme they are going with. Something like this.

For cousin's wedding happened last year, I went to their town 10 days before the wedding date to help out her family as much as I could. Her brother flew in from Europe 2 weeks before the wedding, barely 2 weeks into his new job.
My mom took 10 days off, showed up a week before and stayed a week after to help in anyway she could. 

Then you have the bride's parents here complaining about driving 40 mins. Its ridiculous."
