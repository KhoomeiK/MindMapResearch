bipolar,ffsyl39,t1_ffsx9ri,1580197955.0,"For me, focusing on raptors (birds of prey, they are that badass) got me into I easily, as they are amazing. Especially with Falconry, which is training them to hunt with you. This is used to drive off pests, control invasive populations, and for sport.

If I were you, I would seek an alternative opinion for sure.

Don't stop them on your own, but there has to be something less excessive.

bipolar,ffswln0,t1_ffswekb,1580195435.0,"Dude. It is the easiest hobby I the world! I se awesome birds just going about my day.

Again, not a military person, I wouldn't want to go, but I would certainly feel serious guilt ... Not that I should.  Especially because like now, level mood for about a month, going back up or down feels impossible lol."
bipolar,fcw8x4o,t3_ej3v43,1578019851.0,"Temperature sensitivity hit hard when I first started, and associated headache. I kept hydrated and eventually it has mostly gone away (though I have always been sensitive to heat.. I think it's my Viking ancestors lol).

Noticed some other side effects that I noticed a few years later when my dose was upped substantially (from 600-900mg to 1200mg .. my levels sit around .07-.09).... These side effects were acne, weak hair and fingernails.  I did some research and decided to try a Zinc + Selenium suplement which seems to help a lot. The acne has almost completely vanished with no other variables being changed."
bipolar,fcw81ck,t3_ej0nl6,1578019267.0,I had this a little with Latuda (chemically similar)... I was fine after a few weeks if I ate somewhat healthily and drank ginger beer when it got bad (or whenever I wanted because it is delicious :) ).  Sometimes I also took a Benadryl with it at night.
