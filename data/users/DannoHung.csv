It's more like, 1000 people took the drug not knowing the *actual* risks, so 20 people died.

Like, you realize one of the biggest issues in the Flint crisis is that records of pipe installation were incomplete and poorly maintained over the 100+ year history of the city?

They could test every end point for lead and not know where they all are because the corrosion from the more acidic water source didn't evenly affect the built up sediment in the lines.

A newer fight about this whole thing is that the new Mayor has demanded that the lines actually be fully dug up (as in, dirt removed so that the lines can be inspected in full) in order to determine where mixed materials were in use for the lines because the previous method was to dig small bore holes to do samples of the lines. The State is arguing that digging the lines up is too wasteful but the Mayor demanded the change because there were a number of observed cases where the sampling method didn't actually identify lead lines.

That means that fetch quests should almost never just be get item, sit in ship, drop item off. There needs to be twists and turns and possibly context to make the actions taken enjoyable.

I’m not saying that nothing should be dangerous, but that there is no value in having something boring in the game that *just* eats time in exchange for payouts. Because that is just as bad; people will sit around barely doing anything if it provides a protected upside.

If you tune *only* around risk/reward, then only the high payout content is interesting and players end up optimizing the highest payout path they can manage.

The opposite end of this is how player conflict works. If a player is engaged in an action that is generally drudgery *except* that they may be attacked and lose money, that’s also not ideal, because it means that the only way to reasonably counter their downside risk is to enlist other players in joining their drudgery so they are well protected.

I’m simply saying that thinking about risk/reward first is a mistake and that the second to second or minute to minute gameplay the player is engaging in needs to actually be engaging REGARDLESS of the payout. Because if you plan content around risk reward first, you can justify boring stuff being in the game, which is a deadly error. Nothing should be dull for very long at all.

starcitizen,fdo4nyy,t1_fdnosbm,1578598836.0,"Ugh, can we not have the ""risk/reward"" argument? The trouble with it is that the reason people play games is to have *fun*.  Go to /r/wallstreetbets if you're trying to gamble.

The risk-reward thing comes up and if the devs mistakenly believe it, they start optimizing away from enjoyable gameplay and towards a silly notion that risk taking should have commensurate rewards, which leads to obnoxious optimization which ultimately means you're spending less time making interesting choices and more time slavishly adhering to and chasing narrow behavior paths. Because you know what happens when there's an outsized reward for some perceived risky behavior? People work very diligently on mitigating downside exposure.

The devs should *never* think about risk/reward outcomes and *always* be concerned with making sure that mission structure and gameplay elements are actually enjoyable to all parties. Not just danger junkies looking to make numbers go up."
