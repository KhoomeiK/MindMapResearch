AskWomen,fdcpny0,t3_ekhphw,1578280895.0,"I kind of experienced an opposite scenario. I grew up surrounded by a lot of guys due to spending a lot of time with my brother, male cousins, dad... it helped a lot in learning how to communicate with men because I knew how to talk about things that interest the average man (sports, cars, whatever). Due to all the time spent with men growing up, I realized how overrated men actually were and how society favoured them literally for no fucking reason. Since then (when I was 14-15ish) I have been very vocal and would call out any guy who would say misogynistic or sexist shit because I knew it was essentially a bunch of bullshit. I may have fucked up in a lot of ways growing up but I am glad I never played the ditzy/not like other girls card and I am forever grateful I was able to come to this conclusion so early on and I hope that future generations of girls know their worth from day 1 and don’t have to wait years/decades to realize this."

offmychest,fc97tw2,t1_fc9243x,1577548410.0,This comment sums up my entire experience. My friends definitely all have issues of their own and I doubt half of them actually love themselves but they all seem to be happy and in relationships. I don’t know why I can’t just have that because most days I feel like I will never get to the point of loving myself...
offmychest,fc8wdg2,t3_egonvr,1577543105.0,"How do you know if you truly love yourself? How do you know when you have reached that point in your life and are ready to enter a relationship? I have been single for almost 4 years now. I go to therapy, take meds for my depression, work out, try to cultivate meaningful relationships, do a lot of things on my own and life has yet to fall into place for me. Every year gets lonelier and I’m not quite sure what else is left to do to “love myself first”."
