news,ffgl2e8,t1_ffgiwyo,1579908706.0,"> Bacteriophages are among the most common and diverse entities in the biosphere.[1] Bacteriophages are ubiquitous viruses, found wherever bacteria exist. It is estimated there are more than 10^31 bacteriophages on the planet, **more than every other organism on Earth, including bacteria, combined**.[2] One of the densest natural sources for phages and other viruses is seawater, where up to 9x108 virions per millilitre have been found in microbial mats at the surface,[3] and up to 70% of marine bacteria may be infected by phages.[4]

I'm just going based on scientific literature.  Can you point me to other information to refute this?

But consider this:  There are more phages on earth than there are all organisms combined.  You breath them in every day, you consume them in every meal.  Would you not want to increase your targeted ""known-good"" phages in the real world (i.e. digestive system)?

> For example, while an ounce of almonds has approximately 160 calories, not all of those calories may be available to be used by the human body. When food is eaten, it is broken down into its nutritional components, and its calories are burned for energy. However, just because nutrients are present doesn't mean the body will readily use them. This is the concept of ""bioavailability.""

PublicFreakout,fct4my7,t1_fct3njm,1577932763.0,"> Open carry and concealed carry are legal in Missouri for anyone 19 years or older who can legally possess a firearm, with or without a concealed carry permit (CCP). However, local authorities can restrict concealed carry in any building owned, leased or controlled by the county or municipality and may require a CCP for open carry. It remains illegal, however, for domestic violence offenders, incompetent persons and felons to carry a firearm. 

""who can legally possess a firearm"" I think is probably where this all falls apart for the guys in the OP's video.  As well as the ""domestic violence"" and ""felons"".  What are the odds of the people in the video being felons?"
