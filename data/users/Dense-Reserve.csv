depression,fd6cwc4,t1_fd6ckve,1578189047.0,I know exactly what you are telling me but encouraging drug use on a depression sub is still encouraging drug use even if you think its a silver bullet.
depression,fd6butp,t1_fd658qv,1578188593.0,"You're encouraging drug use, that's not okay here regardless of your feelings about the drugs."
confessions,fd69h4l,t1_fd68ywm,1578187568.0,If that's the only way you're able to feel powerful and comfortable in this world I am sorry. You'll go on for a long time but sooner or later it'll cut you down and deep down you know that. Until then you'll enjoy the high but sooner or later you'll be found out and ostracized.
confessions,fd67w8b,t1_fd67lad,1578186838.0,You're exactly the monster I am pointing out. If they are aware of you they can avoid you. I'm sorry you feel the impulse to do such a thing and I hope you get help in the future.

""They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge. They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above. Specifically you might see people doing the following:

Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying. There are always more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives.

Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy. They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses. Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help. A couple of key points to keep in mind:

**Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment. Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does not involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!""). Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)**

Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible. Any kind of involuntary intervention is an extremely unlikely outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in our Hotlines FAQ post). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect. Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

Please let us know discreetly if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly."""

SuicideWatch,fd29wj1,t3_ejweva,1578143984.0,"This actually does sound like clinical depression because I've had those feelings before too when things in life were okay. You might consider medication, i know therapy wont help because you sound like you're already rational about life you just have that absence of happiness. I'm rooting for you. If you don't find medication to be to your liking that's fine too. Just be aware of that feeling and let it come and go as it pleases because forcing it sometimes makes it much much worse. Someone out there cares."
