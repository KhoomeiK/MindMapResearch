TheDollop,ff6j2gr,t1_ff61ayh,1579628269.0,Hell yeah 👖
TheDollop,ff6j1fe,t1_ff6gurm,1579628251.0,Is it for fun?
ShiaLabeouf,ff6izgz,t1_ff6hlvn,1579628218.0,"Judging by the way people talk about the script on r/screenwriting, I’m honestly shocked it did not get at least a nomination for best screenplay.

(I wish I could find a pdf of it. I know it is a long shot but if anyone reading this has access to it on blacklist or somewhere, could you pm me please?)"

iamverybadass,fe06fhw,t1_fdmc6sb,1578804244.0,"I actively encourage my husband to go do things with people too! I remind him things like, “you haven’t seen so-and-so recently, have you?” and I encourage him to call and make plans. Otherwise he might go a whole year without remembering to!!

But nope. Yup. Still “my fault” if - after beers, a movie, dinner after the movie, and then a few hours of chatting after dinner - he decides to head home and go to bed."

iamverybadass,fdm5yf7,t1_fdm5f06,1578540604.0,"Thank you. The funny thing is, I’m not even 30 yet. (Almost though.) He is five years older. So it’s like... why was I the one people assumed wanted to go home?! I’m definitely the one more prone to wanting to be out late doing stuff. That’s why I really think it’s a gender thing. Because I’ve encountered similar attitudes in many of my previous relationships with men, especially from their friends."

iamverybadass,fdkvwft,t1_fdkr6m7,1578512248.0,"I have experienced that too!! Another similar thing - When my husband got into his thirties, started leaving parties and hangouts closer to 9pm than midnight. Because he was tired. His friends and family always assumed he must have wanted to stay longer and that I (his wife) made him leave. Even when I was clearly the one saying “hey we can stay 20 more minutes maybe?” Nope. I’d still get texts after we left going “I wish you’d let Matt stay out later...” some BS like that. It has always pissed me off."

DisneyPlus,fcvyg6s,t1_fct3998,1578012964.0,Wow! It’s so weird to see him all grown up. I literally just watched Holes last night but I might have to watch it again Friday for the watch along
DisneyPlus,fcvy7vq,t1_fcssfzz,1578012813.0,My husband and I were talking about that last night! We both had that dvd commentary as kids and it was fun to hear the “d tent boys” talk about filming the movie. Wonder if I’d still think all their banter was funny as an adult though lol
DisneyPlus,fcvy2pt,t3_eiouji,1578012718.0,Watched it yesterday and lowkey cried a lot

SoWeird,fctwbre,t3_eii8gu,1577962858.0,"I like Molly the best, probably. I like all her songs, and I appreciate that she actually listens to Fi. Clu and Fi’s brother are always so skeptical of her theories, even when they totally fit the evidence they’re all seeing. It gets frustrating."
SoWeird,fctw79i,t1_fcqevei,1577962679.0,"He’s my husband’s favorite, and he calls him Hagrid. We feel sorry for him because he is the full-time bus driver, all the kids’ tutor, and he’s either the only roadie or the boss of the whole road crew, depending how big the tour stop is. The man has three jobs! No wonder he’s constantly almost getting in crashes (in season one, at least) the man never gets to sleep!!"
fantasywriters,fctvkct,t3_eiraf6,1577961751.0,"Honestly I thought the whole humans and animals thing would *only* work in a fantasy fiction setting. But then I watched the show Bojack Horseman. I was surprised that even in a somewhat serious setting, it only took like 2-3 episodes before the whole anthro animal thing stopped standing out to me. I think if you weave it into the worldbuilding naturally enough, no one will think twice about it, except maybe just at first to get used to it."
AskReddit,fcjqnzv,t3_ehg5ac,1577699763.0,"Mine is stupid. I really didn’t want my husband to get into “Disney Infinity” because if he did he’d just be buying all those damn figures all the time. I explained to him so many times that the game isn’t worth it and the toys are a racket. He always pretended to agree.  
One time I got a *weird* feeling I couldn’t explain. I called him to tell him I had a weird feeling, and to ask if anything was wrong. He was really creeped out and said he had just added Disney Infinity to his cart and was about to check out.  
We had a good laugh. He bought it anyway. I didn’t mind. I was right though. The game was so not worth it. The toys became another stupid thing to collect, and then Disney discontinued the game. Oh well, now we tie dental floss to them and use them as Christmas ornaments."
GarethReynolds,fcjpe3w,t3_efmsjg,1577697940.0,"This is why even though it was available to stream on Spotify, I was sitting there on the iTunes Store at 12:01am on Dec. 6th “purchasing” my first “album” in literally ten years. Glad other fans clearly did similar supportive stuff, and super glad it worked."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fchrnws,t3_eh5nzv,1577653394.0,Great show of de-escalation 🙄 Let me guess... no consequences. Paid leave at worst. Typical.
facepalm,fccgbvr,t1_fcbjv97,1577598068.0,"I’ve experienced that too. I have also had people dismiss my opinion because they see my husband’s gofundme on my profile, and they’re like “well you’re a beggar so your opinion doesn’t matter.” Like just because I fundraise for my husband’s cancer treatment online, that makes me a total piece of shit unworthy of having opinions."
facepalm,fcb5ri1,t1_fcb3i4w,1577582720.0,"The answer to your question has been given all up and down this thread, by others and by me. Why don’t you try to keep up? Not sure why you seem so triggered by me asking questions. Maybe that’s why you didn’t answer any of them."

If that’s what they want to talk about on their Facebook feed, it’s their right to post it, and it’s your right not to look."

You’re already a manager, and yet you have “no clue” what you would do in a situation where a customer sexually harassed an employee that you manage? Like, even hypothetically? You have “no clue” at all?"
