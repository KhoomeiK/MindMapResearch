worldnews,fdoyjpe,t1_fdnl2sq,1578615811.0,"There is two different situations with trophy hunting. One is perfectly moral/ethical and the other is extremely wrong. People who oppose hunting tend to only talk about the later one and ignore the first

A few years ago there was a lion that was moving from pride to pride and killing every lion Cub it could find. It was sterile due to age and killing more lions than poachers were. The park decided it needed to kill the lion to protect the rest. They therefore auctioned off a tag to hunt the lion and paired the rich guy that bought the tag with a park ranger to find the lion and kill it. Rich guy gets his stupid trophy and the park gets rid of the serial killer lion they had to get rid of anyways and gets a few hundred thousand dollars in extra funding for the park. This is completely ethical.

In another situation, a park could only support a certain number of a certain type of herbivore (I can't remember which species). If they went above that number the animals would cause too much stress for the plants which could cause a collapse of the entire ecosystem. They elected to use a mixture of catching extra animals and releasing them in other parks and nature reserves and also selling a limited number of tags to hunters. The money from the tags went towards funding conservation. (In another case it went towards farmers whose farms were being destroyed by large African animals). This is also a perfectly ethical.

In the last situation, a for profit company bribed politicians to allow the company to sell hunting tags. The money from the tags went to the company's shareholders as well as towards more lobbying corrupt politicians for more hunting tags. This is no different then American logging companies trying to get permission to log Yellowstone or Exxon Mobil trying to drill for oil in our parks/reserves. They are exploiting land set aside for the public good for private profit. This is horriblely wrong and I absolutely oppose it.

Unfortunately people that don't like hunting tend to like to use that last situation and claim that all hunting is like that."

The basic answer is yes it was probably justified with the information available at the time.

I'll however argue it from a political side.

The bomb was horrific and bombing Japan showed the world in no uncertain terms just how horrific nuclear war is.

This went MASSIVELY towards making the idea of using more of these bombs so horrific that during the entire cold war not a single nuclear bomb was ever used in anger. Had we not used the bombs in WW2, both the Americans and the Russians probably would have used them in places such as Vietnam, Korea, etc and these bombs ALMOST WERE USED ANYWAYS.

The use of a pair of small bombs in the tail end of WW2 meant that the massive bombs created by the Americans and Russians were never used in war and that fact alone makes it worth it because if one side used them in the cold war the other would have followed until they became common place"

I enjoy eating meat but I really don't like how animals are treated in factory farms. I try to get as much of my meat from ethical sources as I can and hunting is one of them. A gun is the tool I use to get food

I find target shooting to be relaxing. When I am extremely stressed I will get a gun and shoot long range. Stress elevates your heartbeat and increases your rate of breathing. Shooting long range is itself meditative and it also gives me direct feedback on how calm I've gotten as the calmer I am the more accurate I am.

I find shooting clay pigons with my friends to be fun. It is a great social activity

My friends like to hike in areas that are quite rural. There are people in those hunting grounds that have been killed by bears and cougars. It's rare that such attacks happen however they do like to carry a large caliber pistol just in case.

I help my family on a farm we own and we bring our small family dog with us because she likes to run around. We have had coyotes try and eat her before and a gun kept the dog safe.

My coworkers have pets in a fenced in yard. Recently they had coyotes dig under the fence to get in and try and kill their pets. A gun was used try keep their pets safe.

A friend of mine raises livestock. He used a gun to keep his herd safe from coyotes.

A friend of mine has a farm. He uses a gun to keep his crops safe from the turkeys that destroy this property (he also works with fish and wildlife department)

I've met people who lived in unsafe neighborhoods and have used their guns to keep themselves and their families safe from criminals that tried to break into their home. A knife or something else wouldn't have worked because there were multiple attackers

Someone who is very small or disabled would also need a gun to defend themselves if needed. In a major city you are far less likely to need one but in rural areas it can take a VERY long time for help to arrive

&#x200B;

I'm not really sure what you mean by this.

\> Taking a picture is just the press of the shutter release

I recently took a picture of a cool bridge in a town I visited. I spent hours going over maps of the area to find angles that could be pleasing followed by even more time hiking out to each location to decide where I wanted to go before returning at a specific time at dusk to get the look I wanted.

When I photographed a friend's proposal I spent hours coordinating with the man that was going to propose, figuring out times, places, planning out angles. During the actual shoot I had to rapidly move to locations where I had previously found would make good angles to get the shots that I wanted while at the same time ensuring that I didn't get caught by the soon to be fiancee which would ruin the surprise.

While photographing events I have to constantly be aware of everything that's around me and predict moments that would make for good photos with enough time to maneuver into a good angle to take the photo. It requires alertness, foresight, and quick thinking and good instincts.

There is a LOT more involved than just pressing the shutter release.

&#x200B;

\>You’re adding. You’re arranging. You’re creating.

You have control and time in a planned portrait. You can control the clothing, you can control the makeup, you can control the lighting. You can take as long as you need to prepare and often as long as you need to get the shot. You don't have chaos which means you can seek idealized perfection. This is what makes portraiture different, not better.

&#x200B;

\> Creating a portrait is a whole bunch of stuff before and after that press. 

I sometimes spend more time on the ""before"" stuff with some of my portraits (mostly spending a lot more time either hiking or waiting for the conditions to transition into being ""right"")

I absolutely spend just as much time if not more time on my pictures than my portraits. With a portrait makeup, hair, etc can fix someone's hair, skin, etc. Lighting and posing can be used to accentuate and conceal. This means less in post (although still quite a bit). With non-portraiture I have far less control which often means more things to fix in post (hair will often be off, makeup smudged, lighting not quite perfect)."
