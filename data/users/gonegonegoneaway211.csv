depression,ff9s5id,t3_esfp5x,1579720020.0,"Lessee...my best recommendations for you would be:

*Lost Connections* by Johann Hari

*Hyperbole and a Half* by Allie Brosh--not 100% about depression but the relevant segment is surprisingly powerful to me

*Same Time Next Week: True Stories of Working through Mental Illness* edited by Lee Gutkind--also not 100% about depression (it's about a variety of people) but I really liked this one

*Waking the Tiger: Healing Trauma* by Peter A. Levine--sort of an odd read sometimes but I really liked it

And more generally speaking (since I'm not sure what your background is) these are some other books I've found interesting...

*Will I ever be Good Enough?* by Karyl McBride (about narcissistic mothers)

*Traveling with Ghosts* by Shannon Leone Fowler (about a woman who's dealing with the death of her fiance)

*Glow Kids: How Screen Addiction is hijacking our kids and how to break the trance* by Nicholas Karadaras

*under pressure: confronting the epidemic of stress and anxiety in girls* by Lisa Damour

*Madness: A brief history* by Roy Parker--a short but really informative read about the history of how society handled mental illness in Europe

*Birds of a Feather* by Lorin Linder--about a treatment program in which traumatized veterans work to take care of rescue parrots

*Codependent No More: How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself* by Melody Beattie

And some assorted self-help books which...I don't tend to find as useful because I lack willpower but I still took away something from each of these:

*Start Right Where You Are* by Sam Bennett

*Stop doing that $#!%: End Self-Sabotage and Demand Your Life Back* by Gary John Bishop

*How to Survive Change...You Didn't Ask for: Bounce Back, Find Calm in Chaos, and Reinvent Yourself* by M.J. Ryan

(Well, stupid/incompetent/ignorant people.) I'm pretty sure OP is having the exact opposite problem in that he's smart enough to realize he's not as smart as some other people. It's sort of a weird almost catch-22 where it doesn't apply to you if you acknowledge you are the stupid but does apply to you if you insist you are the smartest of smarties."

But it did get me to look up base statistics for cop numbers. There are ~725,000 policemen in the USA, ~125,000 in the uk, and ~1.6 million in China. Corruption is serious issue in the law enforcement world but bloody hell there are a lot of cops out there in a pretty large variety of areas from small towns to massive metropolitan areas. I'm pretty sure the problems they face are similarly variable."
SuicideBereavement,fcmd4yo,t3_ehk105,1577771051.0,"Ah, family. The more important they are to you the more you want to tell 'em all to **** off sometimes. In a way it's actually *because* they are important and thus sometimes it's harder to be honest with them because you run the risk of causing major drama that could come back to bite you in the ass in a big way. It can be stifling. 

Of course the biggest problem here is not being able to get sleep. Dude, I'd be sooo pissed off. I'm a super mellow person 99% of the time but if you start ****ing with my ability to get some shuteye I get really, really upset.

I think the moral of your story is that you shouldn't vacation with your parents again unless you're willing to shell out for your own hotel room so you can just relax a little bit and have your own space. I mean, top-rate earplugs are a second best option, but I think you're probably just in a place in your life where (1) you're a young adult and you're understandably trying to pull away from your parents for now anyway because your future is with your friends and future SO if all goes well and (2) you're going through some **** while they're going through some ****. If you were already on rocky terms with them and everyone's miserable it's going to be hard to stay civil. Make sure you have space so you can be whatever you want to be without worrying about their feelings. It's not their fault, you just need space to recharge so you can actually enjoy the time you choose to spend with them rather than just being trapped with them for a leetle too long.

EDIT: I hope that everything works out for you. And that you finally get some sleep in peace very soon."
AskReddit,fcm7zxn,t3_ehu0ck,1577766655.0,"Work in a (school) library. Libraries are nice because they're public spaces so it's hard to get too comfortable and goof off for long but at the same time they have some interesting stuff to look at when you take a break. Also you can use the public computers for papers. If your computer session is on a timer then you can't procrastinate much or you're going to run out of time to use it. 

In general I just don't like studying in my room because I just want to relax there. Sometimes I do it anyway because it's more convenient but it definitely isn't as effective for me."
depression,fcm0luo,t1_fcjouh1,1577761122.0,"I'm not even going to disagree with that because it tallies with my personal experiences too. That said, I still appreciate when people have genuinely good intentions and love for other people. Not everyone does."
AskReddit,fclr7v2,t1_fcjt28d,1577754507.0,"Well that'd depend on your neighborhood. If it's just you and a couple of drunk buddies in the middle of the night...well (1) drunkeness and mini-explosions don't mix so don't ****ing do that and (2) yes, that is dickish. 

I'm envisioning more of a block party kind of thing where it's sort of a part of the schedule and people know each other well enough to party together and to expect stuff like that to happen that night."
depression,fcjd8ok,t1_fc80aw0,1577683620.0,"Well at least one good thing has come out of your journey, then if you gave a lost little kitten a home. 

You sound like a good soul and a hard-working one for having ticked so many boxes off the ""how do I fix my depression"" checklist! Like all of them! I hope that somehow some doctor finds a diagnosis or some movie miracle happens to you to make your life better."
depression,fcjchy3,t3_ehh1et,1577682990.0,"Yeah but any emotional connection involves investing a part of yourself in that person. So if you kill yourself you're killing that part of them that they invested in you. Which is a dry way of saying it's the emotional equivalent of ripping someone's arm off to take it to the grave with you. Sometimes I look at r/SuicideBereavement and it's rough. 

That's not to say that it isn't, in fact, your life and you can do with it what you will. It obviously is. And it is kinda selfish to try to control what you do. But it's done out of love and a desire for self-preservation which I find kinda hard to condemn.

EDIT: Sorry, this came off sounding judgy-ier than I meant for it to."
AskReddit,fcir2u7,t1_fchuxxv,1577667798.0,And miss out on the opportunity to set off mini-explosions in a totally legal way the whole neighborhood can enjoy?
