This is like the plot of half the chick flicks out there: woman in a committed relationship goes on a vacation, meets some new guy that she falls in infatuation with, and she quickly dumps the guy that's been completely faithful and supportive of her throughout their long-term relationship, with little to no warning.  They cover it with some amorphous ""they didn't really fit well together"" to excuse her dumping him - after doing stuff like agreeing to marry him instead of addressing her deep character flaws.

She's now had more than 6 months notice it was coming up, and bought herself another 4 months, and now wants more?  You know this is going to end up being a frustrating eternal cycle of postponements if fmil has her way.

You need to tell your fiancee that it's either April or **NEVER**.  Not because her mother is right about anything (well, aside from her persistent ability to control her daughter to her daughter's great detriment), but because she's demonstrating **consistently** to you that she will immediately buy into whatever her mother's excuse of the day is and put her mother's convenience first in your relationship.

If you guys are going to be married, **the two of you are the team** (possibly to be joined by a tiny teammate or two later).  Everyone else is just support personnel.  She can't be an effective member of that team if she constantly and immediately surrenders her authority over her own life and future to someone that doesn't want there to be a team at all.

Ask your fiancee to tell you **exactly** what it is that you supposedly did within hours of meeting your fmil that would cause her to break down in tears and call you ""that terrible man"".  If she doesn't know the specific reason, that's something that she's going to have to extract from her mom. I'm pretty certain that the real answer (meaning not likely to be the answer your fmil puts into words) is that you're giving your fiancee independence from parental control, and fmil is terrified of it.

She's going to have to (quickly) learn to set boundaries with her mother, and to not give up her authority in her own life to that woman any more.  If your fiancee doesn't start erecting some formidable boundaries after this discussion, it's pretty clear that you're never going to win this battle with your fmil, and that anyone that marries the daughter will effectively be marrying the mother INSTEAD.

Regarding the money her mother gave her to not marry you - ask her what she thinks her mother thinks of her, that it would take only some money to buy the control over who the recipient of her love is."
