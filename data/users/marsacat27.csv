TeenageSuicideWatch,fff4hws,t1_ffcpjvq,1579875480.0,haha someone understands my sense of (terrible) humor. And idk just being a highschool student with abusive parents isn't really doing it for me atm. I do have my good days and today is luckily one of them.

abuse,ffc13p8,t1_ffbltuf,1579788855.0,thank you i honestly knew it was no hope haha but thats good advice i will definitely use. Im hoping to go to college somewhere my mother doesn't like because she says she will move to where ever i go.
abuse,ff8yytr,t1_ff8iews,1579700504.0,yea idk what im going to do. My mother isn't the worst human being on the planet but she drives me to the point of suicide. theres a possibility she could change but im not sure. My therapist really said i should just to to be nicer to her and get good grades but at this point i don't have much hope. my friend called CPS almost a year ago and they said it was abuse but no one ever came to my house of my school. I would run away but i have nowhere to go and i live in a pretty nice home with stable income.
