It’s sometimes easy to use the example of food 

Being hungry is unpleasant (you could call this dukkha or suffering) , so you eat, and now the suffering or pain, is gone. But you will get hungry again and again and again.  There is no perfect, magical food that will satisfy your hunger forever and ever.  This is just a fact of life, you will never be Ultimately Satisfied.
