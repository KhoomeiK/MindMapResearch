aromantic,fffh8l5,t3_et9puh,1579883909.0,[Came out to my mother](https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/dalo5r/2_years_ago_i_tried_coming_out_to_my_mom_after_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) a few years ago about being asexual and she told me I should “keep quiet about the label” because it was something she “didn’t think I wanted following me around”. She also said “no one will want to marry for friendship” and I’ll be alone forever.

NPD,ff343hl,t1_ff2wdkf,1579533173.0,"Not a dumb question at all!! Most people peg me as an ENTJ as I present as such, but I’m actually an INTJ. I appear more as an ENTJ but the way I think and process the world is definitely INTJ.

Hope this helped!"

NPD,ff28jbv,t1_ff23639,1579496928.0,"I’m not really afraid of being perceived as a failure, so that isn’t much of a factor. I think it’s more due to me being an egotistical perfectionist with very rigid views.

I criticize people based on lots of things, such as perceived intelligence, appearance, socioeconomic status, articulateness, etc. My mother is highly judgmental of everyone for many things, and I believe it has influenced how I view others.

For example, she is (admittedly accidentally) somewhat racist. She also always makes comments on people’s weight (which may have contributed to me developing anorexia).

Edit: I don’t actually verbally criticize anyone; all of my judgments, regardless of how scathing, are done in my head."
NPD,ff2215y,t1_ff21ba9,1579491673.0,"Not hypercritical of me but definitely hypercritical of others (which is part of what has made me into the elitist and judgmental person I am today).

NPD,ff1enf4,t3_er0xrj,1579478236.0,"I didn’t really lack emotional intelligence growing up, but I was highly anxious and self-critical. I believe childhood bullying played a big role in causing my innate narcissistic traits (beyond what is normal in childhood) to develop into a highly-pervasive personality disorder.

I think I took my trauma of being mercilessly bullied/excluded and warped it into the idea that I’m just that perfect that no one understands me."

GetStudying,fetwhbt,t3_eqewph,1579380727.0,"I took this same mindset in high school and tried to work myself past my limits in pursuit of greatness. I neglected friendships, my mental health, and any leisure activity that I enjoyed doing. I greatly succeeded in high school (despite often being miserable) but when I came to college, I was so burnt out that I could barely keep up with my classes.

Strive for balance. I’m the least balanced person I know and I’m constantly operating in extremes, but it really hurt me. Falling into a deep depression because I didn’t take care of myself (sleep, mental health, primarily) and had no enjoyment in my life was a huge obstacle in my goal to achieve a high GPA."

premed,femwn1z,t3_eq12cx,1579271542.0,Depends on what you do while volunteering but I’m gonna go with clinical.
premed,fem80iw,t3_epwbgt,1579243083.0,"I had the same experience, right down to going from overachieving in high school to struggling to leave my bed from depression in college. Things got really bad for me this year and I finally went on medication (I’m doing better now because of it!) but I got two Cs and took two Ws in the process. I’m surprised my GPA survived because I was just that numb and apathetic. I could barely take care of myself and found it difficult to do basic tasks to keep me functional.

College isn’t over for us and we still have hope. Keep doing your best to be your best, both academically and mentally. Take care of yourself and realize that you’re far more effective in any class, volunteer position, leadership role, etc. when you tend to your own basic needs first."

NPD,fefsecs,t1_fefrq2u,1579063788.0,"By connection I mean a dating sort of connection. By attachment, I mean become emotionally invested; often in a romantic/loving sort of way (think people getting crushes and that period where someone is falling in love with a new partner). I have a good deal of friends who get attached to easily only to get their heart broken and spend months trying to get over someone. I’m typically the advice-giver in this situation, which is ironic given that I’m ace/aro.

I have many professional connections. I have made a point of networking extensively, always making sure my professors know me by name. The value of professional connections can not be overstated, especially in cases of letters of rec. It’s also fantastic supply when they see you as an intelligent and capable student in their class.

I also have friends. I don’t get overly attached in the sense that I’m highly-dependent on them but I do value them in my life.

I was diagnosed with NPD and OCPD and found to have traits of ASPD."

If starvation mode existed, my body wouldn’t have let me go from 160 pounds to 98 pounds in less than a year. If your body slows your metabolism SO much to conserve energy, explain how I had hyperthyroidism during anorexia when I had no history of thyroid diseases."
