parrots,fdf6lqo,t1_fdcmy9h,1578354494.0,"Uchi (her name) does this pose whenever she gets wet. Shower/spray...We use spray bottles and she stands just the same. She actively wants to be in the shower and stands right there 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ and does not try to run away like the video stated, after her showers she fluffs, grinds her beak and starts to sing 🎶 ..  she came to us under weight, & we believe she was being bullied by the other birds due to the condition of her feathers. However, I’m glad you brought this up, maybe it will help others. Thank you for your concern, I respect others when they worry regarding any animal, especially any of my children 🦜🦜"

parrots,fcycwsa,t1_fcy1oc9,1578078235.0,"Aww so cute, congrats on the birdie! Corah is a green check Conure that is around 10 months. My biggest piece of advise is research research research! Watch YouTube, read articles, speak with people who also own or handle(d) ringnecks! my next trick is foood! Find out it’s favorite food and only give it to them as positive reinforcement!! 

Things to try if you haven’t already: 
1. Greet your bird with a treat in your hand at the cage door to have them comfortable coming to you and getting used to stepping out in her cage (this will take time and you must be tedious about this) 
2. Try to make sure the area is calming, play favorite tunes! Stick to a certain song at first and repeat it with a dancing motion, excitement, speak to your bird, it does understand. (I can’t sing so I made up my own tune and Corah could care less that I am always off key & I communicate with her more than I do with humans). 
 3. Find out what type of toys it prefers and use for bribery...foraging ones vs. shredders, etc. 
4. Lastly patience & love with conquer all. Your little bird is still a little baby soo never give up!! This is the way! 

I hope I was able to help! Also, what’s your sweet Ringneck’s name? Such a beautiful bird, it is very lucky 🍀to have you!"

parrots,fcwtdfm,t1_fcws63f,1578036821.0,"Congrats on your new child! My gotcha day with Corah was in June of 2019 (3 months old at the time). It took us a couple of weeks...but I wouldn’t go based off a timeframe, I would work on the bond and trust ❤️

You can place your cockatiel on your chest  (more towards bed time, I believe the sleepier the better) and lay your hand on her back. She will eventually get used to this feeling of having your hand on her and not fight it. W you believe she is ready, lean forward slowly and until she is horizontal. If you sense any nerves do not disconnect and get her aquatinted with the feeling of laying. When she is ready slowly, disconnect your chest from her, keeping her in the same position. I strongly advise positive reinforcements and her favorite treats in between sessions. I hope this helps!"
