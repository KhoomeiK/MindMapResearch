AskReddit,ff6xecs,t3_erx7jt,1579636854.0,"Unplug appliances not in use. Within reason of course, some items need constant power like carbon dioxide detectors or refrigerator. But stuff like TV, device charger, and even microwave I think is a big one. Many things you can plug into a power strip. One switch and that's it."
AskReddit,ff63by5,t3_errk9j,1579618090.0,"There's this older lady who comes in the store I work at sometimes. Along with her normal shopping, she proceeds to try and send money, buy a lot of gift cards, really whatever the scam demands. I've talked to her seriously about it and she wouldn't believe me. The first time she was attempting to send $9,000+ to her ""boyfriend"" in a foreign country for his business. We obviously refused it, and so did her bank. I gave her a fraud booklet, and told her to get with a friend or family member to help, and she says ok I'll tell him! Then another time its $2,000+ in gift cards. Again refused, register only let's you sell two anyway for that very reason. I let my coworkers know, but some are so oblivious, and say oh ok I'll just have to do it in multiple transactions. They don't seem to understand the red flags with this stuff. I tried to report the lady to moneygram to lock sending anywhere, but they said I didn't have enough info. I did find them on Facebook, and I debated reaching out to their family. For now I just asked the local police to visit them and see if she's ok. Haven't heard much else, so I don't know if they ever really got around to checking on her."
classicwow,ff60by8,t3_erqn61,1579615838.0,"I remember this being a thing. A friend of mine told me to try it. I was playing a Male night elf, and someone actually gave me 1 gold! Young me was surprised and excited over the results. Didn't work much after that though."

LifeAdvice,ff4nmbj,t3_ermdbj,1579567993.0,"I know it kinda varies per person, each has their own skin situation (more oil etc). Something that has helped me a decent amount was taking a shower before bed. This made my sheets and pillows less dirty over time. On top of that, everytime I did a dark load of laundry, I put my pillow cases in. Pillows, for the most part, can be washed too, just read their tags.

Yes definitely reduce deep fried food, less soda pop, and I'm not sure what else. As far as creams and stuff, one I use is Aveeno clear complexion with acne treatment in it. It is good for dryness and helps reduce acne. Also, do not pick at the acne. There are special tools to help get the clog out. I guess you know its unclogged when a solid particle comes out. But if it's super painful and red, it may scar.

Last bit, see how much a dermatologist might cost in your area. They may be able to pin point and help more."
AskReddit,ff4kxbj,t3_eqf2xd,1579566106.0,"It's like a vivid hallucination. What makes it real for me, I need glasses to see, whatever weird thing that is happening is seen blurry to me. I've seen the shadow figures a few times, once standing by my bedside. Another across the room in a corner just standing there. Slim human silhouette totally pitch black. Sometimes its sounds as well. One time I woke up hearing idle chatter from a group of men, like I left a radio on, but did not see anything. It's like the mind is playing tricks on you. Once I woke up to see a small spikey animal growling at me, and when I actually woke up it was just a pillow.

It's still scary, but now I kinda know what to do and hurry up to move. I feel like I have to either focus on breathing or focus on willing myself to move. Like I'm trying to roll over. Generally I'm able to move fairly quick once I will out of it. I usually have to wait a bit to fall back asleep or it'll happen again."

selfimprovement,fedvpd6,t3_eonldg,1579020889.0,"Not sure what your major is, but some volunteer opportunities can count as an internship. AARP tax aide is one I know of, and some hospitals I believe. I can personally speak highly of the AARP tax aide. Its mostly basic tax returns, you help people in the community for free, they help you learn everything as well as certification, reimbursement for gas, and yea potentially an internship. I did not count it as an internship on my official record because I was going to be charged an absurd amount for three extra credit hours. I think roughly $750-$1500 each. Either way, it's on my resume under experience.

Even if it's not your major, many businesses like to see that you are able to be trained and work well together with others. Best of luck to you, and you'll be in my thoughts and prayers."
selfimprovement,fe8vbjm,t3_eo1ltj,1578931403.0,"Try a nondisruptive night light and yea white noise as the other comment mentioned. Fan, radio, tv (very disruptive put on sleep timer), or there's even special order white noise devices for sale on internet I'm sure. If I wake up, I usually try to watch something non exciting on YouTube, or more of listen to the audio to drift back to sleep. If you have any pets, maybe see if one will sleep in the room with you. If it's about fear of the unknown, maybe reposition your bed and stuff so you can see it all.

Last resort is to try a taking sleep aids. Low dosage of anything, melatonin or etc, but that is by no means a form to rely on from what I heard."
LifeAdvice,fe01n72,t3_enaklf,1578800841.0,"I'm not the most qualified to answer this, but my gut says if you need a new transmission, what else will go out after that? But then again, if you get a used car for around that price it could be the same situation. On the off chance, is this car a 2013-2018 ford focus? Ford really messed up their auto transmissions on these cars and some others. If that's the case, definitely will want to get a different car.

Dave Ramsey has a method for buying used cars every two years I believe. He might be a good resource, but I'm not sure if all his info is free to see or not. It might be just in his paid classes.

Clark Howard has a really good site for almost any financial question you have, and you can even ask him or his team directly through chat, email, phone, etc. I listen to his podcast and radio show often, and he often answers questions live.

Also, I remember watching a few youtube videos on buying cars. Be aware and steer clear from high price cars that are offered with a lengthy term loan. The main point of the video is that many dealers were pushing these high price cars by enticing people with low monthly payments. Not a good idea to take on that amount of debt for that long.

As far as borrowing from friend, be careful with that. Money can change a friendship fairly quick. If they truly are offering a great deal of a loan, be sure you don't take that so lightly. That could be a great aid though.

Well I seemed to try to answer anyway despite my opening statement. Oh and I'm not sure how your area is or the commute but maybe consider a bicycle? Weigh your options, check resources, and see what works reasonably for you. Best of luck, and I'll keep ya in my thoughts and prayers."
LifeAdvice,fdn5m4l,t3_em7wh4,1578577937.0,"Call local police station to report, 911 if observed and immediate danger. The operator may transfer you to the appropriate branch to finish reporting. You must be clear and calm, state what you know and try not to guess, and have in mind they will ask why you suspect the impaired driving."
LifeAdvice,fdm9ums,t3_em28gq,1578543435.0,"It sounds like you need an environment change or at least some positive resources. So that could potentially come from moving with your friend, or it may not or be just the same. You gotta have the right attitude and motivation, but it certainly doesn't make it any better if those around you bring you down.

So, weigh your options, and if you do move, have a backup plan. I'm not sure how close you are with your friend, but just keep it in mind their situation could change too. Either way, start putting money in savings. A great resource or two I know of, for all things money, is Clark Howard. He can tell you how to save on everyday as well as provide great reviews on almost anything you can think of. Dave Ramsey has some good stuff do, but a lot of his stuff you pay for classes to learn, and its more of habits and theory.

If you don't move what are your options? What's in the area as far as opportunity. Ponder over what you may want to go in life and career. Wherever that leads you, find the next step to take you there. No one knows for certain what the future holds, but we can keep making progress and taking small steps somewhere. I'm young and figuring it all myself, and taking small steps helps me.

You are not a let down, keep your head up and spirits up.  I wish you the best of luck, and I'll keep you in my thoughts and prayers."
classicwow,fdiq9rr,t3_elkhra,1578448621.0,Those are excellent finds. Thank you for sharing. It's like Christmas lives on in that tiny spot.
LifeAdvice,fdfxh7x,t3_el5pft,1578372911.0,"I always say at work, when a customer gets mad at you for no reason, they came in like that. They were just looking for some kind of reason to justify their anger. Nothing you did was wrong. I suppose you'd be right to say you can't win with everyone, but that doesn't mean you let it get you down.

If you're getting death threats, you take that seriously though. Forward that stuff to the police. Stay safe, I hope it gets better for you, and I'll keep you in my thoughts and prayers."

LifeAdvice,fcvbckb,t3_ej3soj,1577998536.0,"This is probably not the best advice, but I heard something on the radio kinda related to this. Find and share interests with your kids. The personal example someone gave was they play Fornite with their kids. Or like when you watch a show with the fam.

Then the next best is yea I suppose joining a common interest group on say reddit here, facebook, discord, etc. Although it's still not exactly the same as personal interaction and can lead to more loneliness.

Maybe see if there are support groups nearby. One of my family members goes to this support group for I think emotional support. They get together, have weekly meetings, and have a group chat.

One more personal and big step plug I suppose. Getting involved with a church and their small groups. Some even have programs for the kids.

Weigh your options, see what might work for you. I hope this helps, or I hope someone can give you more helpful advice."
security,fcn7xbd,t3_ehx4b6,1577805589.0,"Talk to him seriously about it, maybe get some scam information print offs to always have near his computer, or maybe even post it notes reminding him to avoid those scam areas. Like a note saying ""never give out your payment details to anyone, if you need help please call and ask."" There are also great resources on YouTube explaining how these scams work. Jim Browning comes to mind for tech scams.

If he goes to places to carry out the scams, sending money or gift cards, maybe inform the workers to please not do his transactions and exercise more caution. I work at a retail grocery store, and I'm very passionate about helping people being scammed. Some you can help, and some you can't. This lady is involved in a romance scam and will not listen to us. I made sure all of my co workers know who she is, what she tries to do, and to call for help to deny the sale. If they don't listen to me, I tell them please get with a trusted family member or friend and ask them if this is what you should be doing, before any other action. I try my best to let them know they could be dealing with a criminal, and that seems to help some people. There's a point where you don't want to insult their gullibility, but especially elder people need to hear the stone hard truth.

As far a monitoring, some sites let you be logged in multiple places. I heard a good use for Google's incognito mode is to be logged into multiple accounts. Facebook has a separate app called Facebook lite, that might work. Messenger, I'm not sure, you could probably set that up to email you when messages come through."
selfimprovement,fcn66qa,t3_ehxrz6,1577804318.0,"Seeing the value in the little things and choices, I can definitely get behind that. I'm not sure if relates a whole lot, but this kinda reminds me of a quote I heard: ""anything worth doing, is worth doing badly."" Now that doesn't mean do everything badly, but I like the example some people have. Like the making your bed self help prompt, you can still make your bed badly, but you did it. A step in the right direction. Another good example was brushing your teeth. It is recommended you brush a certain technique for at least two minutes. If you tend to skip, 30 seconds is better than not at all.

Thank you for sharing and posting this, I will keep it in mind."
LifeAdvice,fckcwyc,t3_ehncka,1577722511.0,"Well yes to agree with the other comment, there's no shame in living at home. Free of bills and other large commitments is an excellent situation to put money away and save. I wouldn't stay unemployed for too long though. Take time to soul search, exercise, eat right, and form healthy habits like good sleep schedule. Also, you could find a less stressful part time job. I know some good places to work part time would be McDonald's, Walmart, medical billing call centers, and some places even look for part time accounting clerks (no degree needed just basic stuff they show you).

If you're not able to get professional help, you're just going to have to confide in those you trust. But again, exercise is a great way to relieve stress and feel better about your self and its free! You don't have to pay to take a run, or do strength exercises in your room.

The best advice that keeps me going is to find the next step. No one knows exactly what the future will hold, but you can sure as heck find the immediate next step. I'll keep ya in my thoughts and prayers, best of luck and hope this helps."
retail,fc77jmh,t1_fc6zqch,1577499628.0,"Yes definitely, I always called it ""looking busy while being busy."" It might be something super simple, and can earn brownie points of course. Sweeping my area is so easy, but management always thought it was the best thing ever."
LifeAdvice,fc73zsw,t3_egfq8x,1577496929.0,"Well right away, one thing I learned is that just because you have that specific degree, you don't necessarily have to go into that field. Some places just like to see you have a degree, you're trainable and you can learn. So an example, you can go to law school regardless of what degree you have. So I considered law enforcement because they'd help pay off your school debt and even pay for law school. There's also no shame in getting a factory job, retail job, or etc and moving up through management.

So if family is an issue, I suppose you could consider moving a little farther away. I wouldn't completely cut them off, but far enough they can't bring you down as much in person. So related to that, military could be a big change in that regard. Move away, and I'm not sure how it'd work but they might pay for more schooling. So you could find a career you want. So if you move away and can't afford it, probably will have to find a roommate. Or even some volunteering programs will even take people in and pay for place to stay, food, etc. An example, SWAP, sharing with Appalachian people, works with the MCC, Mennonite Central Committee, to offer an opportunity like that. Or other organizations like peace Corp or mission organizations through churches.

So in short, it sounds like you need to get out of that situation. If you're about to finish school, I would stick it out and graduate. After that, just take it one step at a time to get where you wanna be. It's difficult to say where you will be in the future, and so the best action to take is the next step. I would start looking for a job five or so months before graduation. Oh! Maybe even internships or job shadowing opportunities. So a good example might be to volunteer with AARP tax aide. It's  super easy, they help you get certified, you help those in your community, and you learn some new skills.

I hope some of this helped, good luck, I'll keep ya in my thoughts and prayers."
