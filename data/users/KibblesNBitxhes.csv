I've found about 3 or 4 helis, even the smokeless one which I'm told is supposed to be rarer than others, but I havent found anything more than backpacks, boots and misc. Mags and hats.

BattlefieldV,ff6qiih,t1_ff6clox,1579632773.0,"The OG xbox one runs it at like 720p or something. The xbox one X runs actual 4k resolutions and is a huge difference in performance and resolution. All the games I play are in 4k and bf4 is the only one i still have downloaded that isnt 4k capable due to not receiving an update. I actually got sick of battlefield 4's terrible performance on the OG xbox and bought the one x and a 4k tv as I was getting tired of potato looking graphics. A very common misconception I see often with people I know IRL and here thought that the xbox one S would also run 4k games and HDR. Not the case, it's clearly says that its 4k playback capable, meaning it can play 4k blu-ray DVD's and streaming in HDR, but not anymore than that.

I dont mean to bash the OG xbox it made my gaming experience top notch when I first bought it. It's still around today I gave to a friend so he could give it to his son for his birthday and it's running fine. I just really wanted an update, and I didnt mind spending money on something I would spend endless hours playing"
BattlefieldV,ff64gq7,t1_ff628lq,1579618893.0,Yooo my dude can you please carry a message for us? Ask DICE if they can update battlefield 4 console version so that we utilize the mid gen upgrade for it.

I didnt have a problem with enemy MG42 spraying me down. It felt like a real battle back then and it was necessary to take cover or die. Idk I feel like there was gameplay that a lot of us experienced that conditioned us to be better players than we were the week before. Now that devs are tailoring games to be easier for new comers, that conditioning won't be there for them. That's just my 2 cents on the matter"

battlefield_4,ff4iuqo,t3_ergfoe,1579564664.0,It's like DICE wanted a crack at a COD map. Still better laid out though IMO I do still hop on to a server that only plays this map every once in awhile. Been hopping on 4 more often cause of MW being damn close to the customization but never really itching that good spot. The MTX kinda killed my vibe about the new cod. I like the bf4 progression more

battlefield_4,ff37ccn,t3_er7h67,1579535422.0,Battlefield the only game that I'll use a grenade launcher in. Any other game feels like youd do more justice throwing it by hand. Refer to call of duty's facked up sense of projectile drop over 40 meters. Those shirt guns they use at concerts have longer range
DayzXbox,ff35guy,t1_ff2g9e0,1579534136.0,"I did that originally and that's been my method ever since. Only reason why we set up in a damn building is cause they all voted against me, ironically they named me the leader too. Told them its easy to find your way back to a forest stash if you take 10 minutes to look around and remember the location. Since then I've gone solo and made a home in the woods. Although I may be in close proximity to other bases(can hear gunshots and found a sarka 15 minute jog due south)in the forest. My stash is in bear territory. Cant even drive close to my stash without being chased away from a bear or a pack of wolves and I like it. Means I have to walk everything in all sneaky but also means any unsuspecting bandit may end up being dinner for a bear. It's a good relationship me and the bears. They waddle around making noise, best fuckin security ever."

DayzXbox,fegvkzd,t3_eorqd4,1579103512.0,"Nope all our stuff was in the back room, random barrels everywhere and we used to have 3 large tents and a car tent. Also another tent up at NWAF that I was using for 2 weeks before I had a group to run with. Even then nobody found my shit and it was a 2 minute walk from the northern tents, I got many kills there just waiting in the Bush for some poor survivor to come. The stupidest thing I've seen so far was these 3 guys, I shot the first one at the camo tower structure, but waited to see if anyone else would come along, not too much later, maybe 20 minutes pass and another guy goes up there, same exact position cause he was looting the corpse. So theres two guys there now just looking like a grey mass on the second floor there. Shit you not a third guy went up there just before the server restart. It said it would be in like 3 minutes but instead it just happened right then. After I log back in, the bodies are gone, the guy is gone. I'm still sitting there in position. Maybe he'll log in soon? I wait for a half hour after the restart but he doesnt show up. End of story"

So me and my group were looting NWAF and a guy who was watching our stream wanted to join. Said sure and sent the server info. Little did we know the fucker was helping stream snipers keep tabs on where we were as I was with the guy streaming and we made the new guy go with buddy to loot another area. Groups of 2 is better than being alone after all. My buddy said he had a bunch of followers who were gonna attempt to raid us cause like he streamed every fucking thing. We say bring it on and the killed they're informant. The guy hanging outside the truck is the informant being paraded around NWAF before we make our way back to base and prepared for the battle. Our base was in the industrial area of novoya petrovka the building with the big blue doors and second level. 3 hours pass and finally sounds like someone's outside. We've been ready the whole time so nobody needs to move or make sounds. One guy goes and opens our door with a lock pick and immediately runs for cover. Not a shot yet. But we can hear him just around the corner. Me and another friend see a guy on the building next to us trying to get a look onto the 2nd floor where most of us were holding position and instantly shoot the fuck outta him. His body flipped out and went sky high then back down. The guy at the door meanwhile attempted to peak his m4 around the corner and stepped out a little too far and ate some 7.62. Me and buddy rush him, he dies just before we even line up a shot. We head back in and I get shot in the back. Theres a sniper directly across from the gate and he has full view of the inside of the base.  They close the doors and hunker down, taking all my gear off my body so that I can get it when I get back. While I was coast side from what I can tell they killed the sniper whom took out another guy before he met his demise and two others came rushing in after, thinking maybe the guys would finally put they're guard down after. They were wrong. I got picked up in elektro and got back in one piece. They enemy logged off after dying. The battle was won. We log off with accomplishment and wake up to a raided base. Theres a lot of key points that I do not mention as to why I left that server after but, every other group in that server turned out to be rats and cheats. Since then I've found a good community to be a part of and I'm enjoying it."
