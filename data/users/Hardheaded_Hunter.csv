There is no regulation that the Army has released that requires you to live IN your Barracks.

You must maintain the Barracks room that you have signed for though.  

And if you have issues with Mold, broken AC units, and general maintenance, get with your Barracks Managers.  They put in the Work requests, and you CAN hold them to a timeline for fixes.

If they don’t hit them, open door the Garrison CSM."

He could open the fridge, pull out the meat drawer, and help himself to the lunch meat, without making a sound.

If he was thirsty, he would drink from the water dispenser on the door.

I had to replace my fridge, with one that had locking pins on the door, to prevent the loss of food to that little monster.
