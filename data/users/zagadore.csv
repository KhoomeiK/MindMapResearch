SiouxFalls,fehgm6s,t3_ep4shu,1579116124.0,"From the other end of the perspective:  I was the manager of a location in Iowa where Obama held a small rally during his 2012 campaign.  It was fascinating to observe how this event came together, and who did what.  A visit that only lasted about 45 minutes (and got about 15 seconds of tv air time) took 5 days to set up on my site alone.  There were about 20 ish federal employees plus the campaign staff involved in setting up for the event.  They actually had new internet cable run out to my site just for this 45 minute visit!  It was fascinating how tightly controlled everything was.  They actually openly said that they only wanted a specific number of people there.   They made a specific amount of free tickets available at the local Democrat Party headquarters, and if you didn't have a ticket you couldn't come.  The campaign also bussed in people (like the OP) to fill out the audience (making sure the crowd was friendly).  The campaign staff hand picked people who they posed in a location that was behind the President when he was on camera speaking.  Everything about the event was geared for how it would look on-camera. This experience led me to develop a very great respect for the Secret Service and other servicepeople who work directly for the President as he travels.  The 20 something campaign boys and girls, however, were either pushy, self-important pains in the butt or mindless cattle herded into position for the tv cameras.  The Secret Service men and women seemed to regard them with resigned amusement.  It WAS cool to meet a candidate, though, and talking to a sitting President was something I'll always remember.  When it was over it  was the Secret Service and my staff who ended up cleaning up after everybody, which we did not appreciate or enjoy.  That visit also ended up costing us money, which was always pretty tight at the best of times.   I have a good fund of stories from the experience, though!"

The 2020 MOSES conference is soon, and you should really go if you can:  https://mosesorganic.org/conference/  Through Moses I found an organic farmer who farms in the area where our land is.
