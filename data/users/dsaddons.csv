buildapcsales,ffuw3zb,t1_ffuu96m,1580250450.0,"Definitely not most. Even then, the 3700x is pretty neck and neck with the 8700k in single core (and only just behind the 9900k). Meanwhile in productivity the 3700x crushes.

I swap between blue and red and red and green nearly every time I build, have to go with what's best at the time. 3700x is the buy right now for a $300 CPU and has been since it released."

flightsim,ffuscmy,t3_evbso9,1580248441.0,Check the forums for an update
buildapcsales,ffus1rx,t1_ffuqwvu,1580248277.0,It's 2020 though. If you're buying a new processor multi core performance should take precedent. Not to mention it will take over more and more going forward in the next 4-5 years you'll own in.
buildapcsales,ffum2vq,t1_ffua6rk,1580244835.0,and get better performance lol.  Idk why people are so eager to recommend anything other than the 9900k (for people who want MAX frames) from Intel on higher end builds.

Well hopefully neither of us have to compromise!"

nyc,ffrm0as,t1_ffrlw7i,1580160808.0,Is it general human condition to believe my group is the best? I don't think that's true
flightsim,ffr54bb,t1_ffr3vfa,1580150656.0,"No date on either cards or MSFS yet, which is why I'd just wait. If you're on a 1080 it's not like you can't play any game."
flightsim,ffr3m14,t3_eurpn9,1580149722.0,Id wait for the RTX 3000 cards or Big Navi rather than getting a 2080ti. You're on a 1080 now so you'll be able to hold until q3 this year just fine. MSFS won't be out til then anyways.
