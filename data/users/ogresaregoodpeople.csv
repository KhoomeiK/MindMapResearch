My boyfriend works in a huge warehouse and bikes to and from work, so even with just his commute he gets an hour of cardio. Then working he gets close to 20k steps. 

I work a sedentary job from home, but waitress at night. In a tiny, semi-busy restaurant I clock 6000 steps for a dinner service. Pacing around the house and during calls gets me to about 3500. So that’s 9500. 

I run for 40 minutes every other day which on average is 6500 steps. So getting 16k every other day is pretty normal. And remember I only work HALF shifts waitressing at a tiny restaurant. A person who works all day, and at a bigger restaurant can easily clock 16-20k daily.

AsianParentStories,ff9lub3,t3_esdf4q,1579715711.0,"I disagree with people who say your parents are narcissists. 

It sounds like your parents are afraid your brother will have a terrible life, because of his behaviour. They're coddling and enabling him, because they truly believe if they do enough he can turn his life around. But he's manipulating them, and using them to cushion himself from consequences. They are worried that your brother will be alone (abandoned by his siblings) when they're gone, and so they come down on you when you show any hint of disliking him. If you ask me, this is not right, but it's understandable. Every parent wants their child to be happy and safe, and at this point, they probably think if they died tomorrow, your brother would end up living on the street. 

Likely, they don't pay as much attention to you, because they don't ""have"" to worry about you. They can have high standards for you, because they (in their mind) can expect the best from you. 

Your parents are enabling your brother, because they don't understand that's what they're doing. And they don't understand he's manipulating them, because they don't believe that their child would be capable of that.  

Unfortunately, I don't think this is something you can solve yourself. Asian culture is very against counselling and therapy, so I don't think your parents and brother would subscribe to that. 

What YOU can do, is seek therapy, and get the help you need to make sure you are emotionally and mentally safe. This sounds like a terrible situation for your family, and I'm so sorry you have to go through it. Please don't underestimate the value in getting help for yourself. It can help you let go."

As far as I can recall, as it’s been a while since I’ve not taken this fact for granted, the idea that children weren’t loved was big in the 70s. 

Part of the problem is that we don’t have a lot of written info on family life (especially of the peasantry). But what we do have (letters, journals, poems) suggest people mourned their children when they died. There are also paintings where children have toys and other things they wouldn’t have if a loved one didn’t give them the items. If you’re interested in daily life I have a recommendation. It’s a little later than medieval, but the Paston letters give great insight into historic family life."

The placenta is something mentioned, but it’s more in the context of addressing how people assume the midwives were sloppy and didn’t correctly deliver the baby. Midwifery was a skilled profession, not something random women were just asked to do. Jane would have had the best available. It’s more that a piece of placenta being left is less likely the cause of her death than the likely infection from prolonged labour, which is still a very prevalent cause of death for women who go through prolonged labour but don’t have access to antibiotics."

todayilearned,fez644q,t1_fez0sof,1579454166.0,"Agree with this all, except Jane and Anne of Cleves. 

Jane’s labour was intensely long and difficult, and it’s possible her body was no longer able to fight off infection from the many small tears she experienced. If things were sanitized as they were today it might not have been a problem, but it’s not to say that the woman delivering the baby would have been dirtier than usual. Unfortunately when the body is pushed to the extreme for that long it becomes unable to resist infection. 
The theory that someone left a piece of placenta is less likely, as they would have had extremely experienced midwives attending.

Anne of Cleves didn’t just survive. She thrived, being gifted a rich estate with incomes to match, and no husband to tell her what to do. She got to enjoy an independent and rich life, that few other women experienced at the time."

The first, because they learn the more food they take, the less someone else has.

fitbit,fcd8469,t1_fcczhpr,1577607539.0,"I would double check and make sure that everything was entered correctly (your height and weight, the start and end time of the exercise, and the type). Then check the heart rate and make sure nothing outlandish is going on (ie: it saying you're going at 180bpm the whole time). Try it once more, and if it gives you wrong data then you may be able to compare that data with today's and see if it's a problem with the app or the hardware itself."

But the way the owner handled it left a bad taste in my mouth, so I've never gone back, nor have any of my friends."
toronto,fc9ewdt,t3_egmdhn,1577551640.0,"Unfortunately this is common in the restaurant industry. Years ago I worked at a popular gastro pub and there was a server I didn’t get along with for many reasons. One of those girls who proudly called herself a  “bitch” to excuse her crappy behaviour. We were alternating tables as each came in, and on her turn, a group of young black people entered. She turned to me (I’m a person of colour) and with the most disgusted look on her face said “YOU can take them.” This person was 20-22ish by the way. I said it was her turn and she repeated “LOOK at them. I’m not serving those people.” I was so shocked I just repeated it was her turn and she laughed and walked away, leaving me to seat them. They were a group of students visiting from America- I felt so bad about the welcome they might have gotten if I wasn’t there. 

By the way shortly after I complained to the boss about it, I was fired. She wasn’t. 

A lot of pub owners are racist, and sexist too, sadly. And they protect the workers they see as like-minded. I guarantee if this place is full of racists, the boss has been told. He or she just doesn’t care or agrees with them."
