todayilearned,fcw4tbw,t1_fcvt0is,1578017161.0,"I can elaborate. My parents are from Ohio, raised  Amish but became Mennonite and left their comfortable way of life, travelling  to Northern Canada to be missionaries. So my upbringing was unusual in a lot of ways, and not typical of most Mennonites. Life revolved around the church and most of my friends were other missionary kids. For a short period of time my siblings and I went to public school but then the church started their own school, I suppose to further cloister us and prevent the bad influence of the town folk. My parents had a large garden, my mom canned and froze food from the garden,  baked lots of bread, all our clothes were hand sewn or donated from churches back in Ohio. We had no money, just stuff donated to us. I sometimes can’t tell what weirdness of my childhood is the Mennonite part and what was the missionary part.  Despite my upbringing and much to the dismay of my parents, today I am totally non religious, politically liberal, am divorced, but I still love to sew, make jam and play old time hymns on the piano."

I was brought up Mennonite and taught to love everyone, even, and especially, those who hurt you. Even when you don’t want to, or don’t genuinely feel it, you must always love and forgive. Because harbouring hate, and not forgiving,  means you will burn in hell."

todayilearned,fcvi6n1,t1_fcvfry9,1578002608.0,"The reason he looked the same as everyone else is because he’s a guy. The female beachy Amish still wear long dresses and bonnet things on their heads. I grew up Mennonite, my parents were raised Amish. My biggest beef was how women were expected to dress, to look different and the guys could just put on a regular pair of pants and a shirt and no one had to know they were Mennonite. It’s a way of maintaining control over women and limiting what they can do."

Showerthoughts,fbtyhd1,t1_fbtxiw7,1577102435.0,"I get that too. I just see  dancing, squiggly lights, but no pain. The first time it happened I thought I was having a stroke and I left work and went to Emerg. Of course by the time I saw anyone it had passed. I feel weird afterward but no headache. Most times, though,  I get the “I want to die” pain. I prefer the dancing lights."
