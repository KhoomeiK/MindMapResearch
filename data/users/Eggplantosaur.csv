In the US police officers just empty e tire magazines into anyone who mildly threatens them.

Additionally, paratroopers were dropped behind the beaches to hold off reinforcements and secure as many bridges as possible.

Interestingly, the bombing of the railways was so effective that the allies became burdened with supply issues themselves until the Port of Antwerp was captured months later. To alleviate supply issues, a very large trucking program was set up. This program was called the Red Ball Express, and allowed the allies to keep their offense going. Germany couldn't rely on trucks for supplies like the allies, because of lack of materials and a severe shortage of oil.

The Allies also attacked on a different location. Approximately a month after the Normandy landings, the allies executed operation Dragoon. Massive amounts of troops were landed in the south of France.
