science,ff67jsx,t1_ff654kx,1579621001.0,How does that work? If anyone you care about is harming themselves significantly with something arenâ€™t you an arse for not trying to help? With drugs or cigarettes or whatever it might be

FIFA,ff3spvk,t3_eo2c4h,1579548028.0,"So itâ€™s the players fault for getting suckered into spending all the money, rather than the companies being predatory and putting stuff in the games to affect gameplay and make you want to spend frightening amounts of extra money in them...

When you trying and protect children from stranger danger, from lots of outside influences thatâ€™s because nothing can be done about someone deciding one day they want to kidnap a child for example, but something CAN be done about games with awful microtransactions - donâ€™t put them in the game you make! Itâ€™s like the kidnapper chucking you a leaflet of how to help stop your kids being kidnapped as easily because he canâ€™t help kidnapping so he canâ€™t stop it, you just have to be less kidnappable"

StarWars,fe18b8d,t1_fe0vdmz,1578823675.0,"Word of advice, I agree with everything you said but if you want anyone to ever agree with you take out the last sentence. Youâ€™re spot on with TLJ stuff but if you were trying to change someoneâ€™s mind with that statement, in order to agree theyâ€™d have to agree that theyâ€™re an idiot too which people obviously wouldnâ€™t do. Thatâ€™s why people donâ€™t back down on internet arguments because typically theyâ€™re insulted at the same time so they double down on what theyâ€™re saying, right or wrong"
StarWars,fe17vts,t1_fe0rqrt,1578823499.0,"But how else would it work? Take an employee or sports star or whatever, if theyâ€™re absolutely amazing at what they do and they make a mistake, theyâ€™re forgiven because itâ€™s a one off and you can normally rely on them. Take someone whoâ€™s always in trouble and letâ€™s you down regularly, something fairly minor would irritate you way more than the first person doing the same thing because itâ€™s a build up of everything else. Last Jedi had multiple things that irritated people, so pulling off a milking scene in the midst of that seemed like it was taking the piss, whereas if it was a great movie and they decided to put it in then I still personally think the milking thing was quite weird, but it wouldâ€™ve been forgotten about because the good would outweigh the bad"

SWGalaxyOfHeroes,fdz5fxa,t1_fdyec3r,1578786886.0,"I started because I saw a trailer and it looked like playing with my actual figures when I was young. I havenâ€™t spent a penny on the game and didnâ€™t really think about needing to catch anyone to be honest. Iâ€™ve got one gear 13 now and plenty of gear 12, having played just under 3 years (started March 2017 contrary to my post title). Iâ€™ve never been fussed about picking the team that wins, I just play with my favourite characters (within a synergy team of course) and I win some, I lose some. Iâ€™m working on the old republic atm so I can get Revan as I loved KOTOR and am desperate for Malak at the moment!"
StarWarsBattlefront,fdy0yv7,t1_fdxqg9i,1578774926.0,Yeah unless there was something in the clone wars I donâ€™t think they ever had a battle there
StarWarsBattlefront,fdxoipu,t1_fdxnv5p,1578771262.0,"Iâ€™m always confused about the Mustafar thing. It seems to be everyoneâ€™s preference for the next one but I never heard Utapau mentioned in comparison. The Battle of Utapau was really central to one of the films, whereas the clones never went to Mustafar, as cool a planet as it is. Heroes vs Villains would be unreal on a Mustafar map"
StarWarsBattlefront,fdwh1xv,t1_fdwgaez,1578758601.0,"Well the ROTJ take about Luke was that he always saw the good, he was prepared to die to prove that one of the most tyrannical people in the galaxy was still a good guy, and then had a couple of visions and went as far as going into his room and drawing his lightsaber to kill him. I know people change throughout their life but would Return of the Jedi Luke really have done that? Even if people bought that bit, it just feels like a huge waste of him and itâ€™s a bit depressing seeing the most hopeful person in the entire galaxy reduced to throwing his fatherâ€™s lightsaber about for a cheap joke"

Futurology,fdpumul,t1_fdpmnfb,1578641163.0,"I wouldnâ€™t have thought theyâ€™d be that high, the real height is for planes yes, but the point of speeders and flying personal vehicles in say Star Wars is because the buildings are so high and they can dock at different levels. Properly regulated I donâ€™t see why up to a certain height it wouldnâ€™t work, anyone can decide to drive on the other side of the road at any point now and kill everyone but generally they donâ€™t, so they wouldnâ€™t go outside their designated lanes. You keep it clear from airports and you put in a device that doesnâ€™t allow the vehicle past a certain height, if you had â€˜3Dâ€™ lanes of traffic they wouldnâ€™t need to be higher than a hundred feet or so anyway to be effective"
Futurology,fdoxo4l,t1_fdosrke,1578615240.0,"â€˜Jump 20 years into the future nothing would changeâ€™, yeah like my parents looking at the world now, it hasnâ€™t changed much since the 80s, and similarly looking ahead to the 40s now it wouldnâ€™t be too different, but just interesting to think how far youâ€™d have to go before we really didnâ€™t recognise it. Like I said people in the 1800s would look at skyscrapers and roads now and think wtf is that"
Futurology,fdoxhez,t1_fdoi31o,1578615118.0,"Are you familiar with Coruscant in Star Wars? I donâ€™t see it being unreasonable that in the future theyâ€™ll invent small personal shuttles or something that having to stick to â€˜sky landsâ€™ very strictly. They could put GPS in to ensure no oneâ€™s driving outside the designated lane, just means you can have multiple lanes on top and around each other that would reduce traffic. With the advancements in AI they could have free zones like the German autobahns, but in the end event of a possible collision then the AI would avoid it like in self driving cars coming up"
EASportsUFC,fdoebef,t1_fdocgda,1578603535.0,"Working my way through it now, itâ€™s the first UFC game Iâ€™ve played so I have no comparison of whatâ€™s good or not. Bc it annoyed that the press conference features that was in the trailer seems to just be limited to a cutscene in the buildup to a fight rather than actually doing something in it like it was portrayed"

StarWars,fdo39x8,t1_fdjd8yj,1578598097.0,That and it was the first big win against the empire and set the course for the subsequent events. All it is is Disney saying â€˜our films are centre of the galaxyâ€™ rather than the originals
saltierthancrait,fdo31sg,t3_elq875,1578597981.0,Itâ€™s so transparent that itâ€™s literally them saying â€˜our films are the centre of the galaxyâ€™ not the original film that came out. Who the fuck was complaining about BBY

StarWars,fd3cogh,t1_fd2g7up,1578156920.0,"I love Rogue One, I think itâ€™s the best thing Disney have done since they got the license but yeah sheâ€™s not the best female lead Star Wars has ever had"

They donâ€™t have to be a massive badass but they need to lead and take charge as a lead, otherwise youâ€™re just an â€˜along for the rideâ€™ side character, which she is along for the ride more often than not during the film"
StarWars,fd179ou,t1_fd0mfll,1578128247.0,"My favourite one of these was the â€˜outrageâ€™ from people on twitter about the Fallen Order casting like â€˜oh here we go, another white maleâ€™.... The game before that, Battlefront II, had an Indian woman as the lead. Canâ€™t please some people"
StarWars,fd1711p,t3_ejrnzg,1578128160.0,"Jyn doesnâ€™t really do anything for herself, she spends most of not all of the film being led by others. She gets rescued at the beginning as a kid, she gets rescued by K2, she gets rescued by Chirrrut and Baze, she gets rescued by the ship off Jedha, she gets lucky the rebels come to Eadu and gets rescued by the rest of the gang, she leads the rebels into Scarif but once in the base she may as well not be there until the end, and even then she gets saved again by Cassian and then she dies. Sheâ€™s not a bad character per se, but sheâ€™s way more a trailer than a truck during the film and I think thereâ€™s better female leads out there.

***Rise of skywalker spoiler***

Come to think of it though Rey got beaten by Palpatine and only came back because of all the Jedi and Kylo
