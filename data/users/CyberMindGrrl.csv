Here's the story:

>The CBC also received screen credit for contributing development funds towards the new series. Graeme Burk, writing in the June 2009 issue of [*Enlightenment*](https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Enlightenment_(fanzine)) (#151), however, states that it wasn't a traditional co-production so much as it was an acquisition deal (it was credited as a co-production because the funding was given in advance of the series being produced). Burk writes that a more traditional co-production model can be found with the the CBC's involvement in the Showtime cable series *The Tudors*, where they not only provided funding but also creative input. There was ""no real weight"" with the CBC's co-producer credit on *Doctor Who*.

buildapc,fehghdb,t3_ep46ef,1579116045.0,"BTW it's always good practice to do a ""box build"" before installing all your components into your chassis.

What is a ""box build"" you ask? Well, that's where you take your motherboard, put it on top of the box it came in, then plug in all your components including power supply, GPU, CPU, RAM, hard drive, etc. Then find the two PWR poles from your front chassis connectors on the motherboard and short them out with flathead screwdriver. After you turn on your PSU, of course. 

This way you can easily swap out bad components in the UNLIKELY (but not impossible) event of DOA gear. This will save you considerable time and headaches."
