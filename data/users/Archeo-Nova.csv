getdisciplined,fg6k4q4,t3_ex1p95,1580570110.0,"Well, it's funny, it seems to be one of my greatest issues, but I thought, I'm quite alone with this experience (apart from a friend of mine, we are very similar, but quite different from a lot of other people I know. But here I find a thread with a whole bunch of people struggling with the same problem. So I will tell of some of my experiences and thoughts, maybe they might help you or others. It might seem somewhat extensive, but I'm in no way an expert, just consider it food for thought. If your up to, leave me a response, I wonder, if my approaches are worth anything, I'm still in an ongoing change of attitude process myself and far from reaching my goals.

I think, it depends on the character disposition you have, wether you are more prone to this behavior.  I described myself as a introverted person, who responds strongly to emotions, altough I seem to keep them for myself, thus I like the romantic side of quite everything. Popular culture transmits often romantic feeling of things, which you might experience quite different in reality, that's what I had to tell myself recently, before, I always thought, feeling like being Rocky will help me in any situation, which I had to sorrowly renounce, I saw that feelings are temporal and subconscious, you can't force them to come up and hold on to them, in other words you can't rely on them. Romantic aesthetics are designed, to invoke feelings, which seem eternal in this situation, but reality is different and feeling like being and actually being something or someone can be two pair of shoes.

Since then, I myself try to take the stoic and rational approach as a baseline, but be open to inspirations romantic feelings are offering. If you for example have watched an inspiring movie, use the momentum this feeling creates, but be aware that it is temporal, you won't get around the monday morning drag the day after. There try to find a middle ground, something, which in my experience is always a balance act between mind and heart. Some tasks require more of the first, some more of the the latter. For example exercising and studying are different activities in this regard. Both of them require will power, but studying in the so called ""beast mode"" seems to be not very effective, calmness and focus are more requested than an explosion of emotions, quite self explanatory. But then again, you can exercise in a calm and focused manner or in the beast mode, there it's a question of character and which works best for you. Often there are many way, but not everything works.

If you want to complicate it, you could distinguish between feelings you harbor and feelings, which a certain situation or space might invoke. Romanticism seems to unify both fields of emotions into one. For example, if you see a heroic battle scene in a movie and you get this feeling of elevation, you might think, that's what fighting a battle is like, great and epic. Chances are big, that it would be quite the opposite, your subconscious will tell you constantly, that your going to die any second and you feel like getting out of there as soon as possible, the actual heroism consists of carrying on nonetheless. Not that I ever was in a combat situation, but I guess, it's more going to be a grueling experience than a positive one. I just brought that up, to give an explicit example. Try to be aware of these differences, they might help you adapting to situations."
NoFap,ff71qcl,t1_ff3hu3w,1579639386.0,"Well, okay, I actually don't want to dicuss this too much further on, but just to clarify, I made a clear distinction between masturbating with pornography and masturbating without it. The first thing I see of course as problematic, otherwise I wouldn't have joined this sub. The latter on the other hand was of course done all through history. I happen to study Archeology and know something about history. The way we overpromote sexuality in general today is problematic, but a lot of culturally persistent problematic values, which actually in the end lead to the popularisation of pornography, stem from our western history of sexual repression. Psychoanalysis in the 19th century allowed the discovery, that masturbation is part of your normal development process, through it you discover your sexuality and get acquainted with it. Again, from this standpoint, also excessive masturbation can be a problem. And if masturbation is your only sexual outlet in your twenties, it's also not the best thing, but maybe also not the worst. There are also studies indicating, that if your not sexually active over a few years, your fertility, sex drive and stamina can be lowered. Sorry for getting so right to the point, but I mean, if I'll be with a women, I kind of don't want to cum after few seconds. Now the only thing I want to say with this, is, that I'm unsure, if the black and white thinking regarding masturbation per se, without pornography, is really the best way to go. Of course, in a lot of religions, there is a tradition of people dedicating there life to abstinency, but this usually lasts for life, so they don't have to worry about there sexuality at all anymore.

In any case, I might be wrong, misinformed or poorly informed as so far, I also plan on staying on hardmode and look what will happen."
NoFap,ff2sebt,t1_ff107nl,1579522104.0,"Ok, thanks for the answer. Where I might be having a different opinion, is that masturbation NECESSARILY equals an obsession, I mean, people of all ages masturbated before pornography and it didn't seem to be a problem (altough admittedly, there were probably no studies about it before the sexual revolution). So my question was, if being sexually unactive is really the best for EVERYONE. But of course, I get, that in order to guarantee an overcoming of this dramatic addiction in the long run, it's best to stick to a firm set of rules.

Maybe it would be a good thing to have a separate thread for a meta-discussion on Nofap, in order to avoid discouraging people in a difficult phase through exposure to a critique, just a thought.

Anyway, good luck on your journey!"
NoFap,ff0ps30,t3_eqvfjy,1579471147.0,"Well, I think, I never saw a meme describing it better. Back then, childlocks seemed like the worst invention ever, now you know, allowing children to acess Internetporn is like selling kids heroin at the candy store!!"
GenderIssues,fes4jun,t1_fenrmva,1579361362.0,"Thanks for the response, very interesting stuff. Just to clarify, I'm a 24 year old manchildish University student (a rather bad one), with virtually no life experience, I've never been in a relationship and I don't have a lot of direction in my life, so I don't know, what I'm actually talking about. Still, under these premises, I think, there are not a lot of men, who joined the military and have such an openness towards gender topics, but maybe I'm completely mistaken. Personally I think, exactly people like you can make a big difference in social change. When you talk about having some rather right wing minded friends from the army, I guess you are someone, who could give them a different perspective on the matter, because they might trust you more than a radical feminist speaking up against unequality on TV. I'm not an expert on the Archetypes, I didn't read Iron John myself as of now, nore did I know Joseph Campell and his book. So I'm actually pretty new to the topic myself, I just know somewhat, that there are supposed to be different Archetypes for women. The concept of the Archetypes and the collective unconcious are ultimately taken from the pioneer of depth psychology C. G. Jung, I would recommend you, to read his work, if you want to find out more, about the female side of this concept. The central work there, I think, would be the [*Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetypes_and_the_Collective_Unconscious)*.* There is of course r/Jung too, a pretty active community."
getdisciplined,ferted1,t3_eqc3qd,1579358195.0,"Well, I was thinking more or less about the same problem, when I just now opened reddit and read this post! What are the odds!? I have similar problems, when it comes to get things done under pressure, I feel an seemingly abnormal pressure, altough I'm unsure if it is really so strong as in your case. Simple everyday activities like cooking and so on doesn't present a big problem for me. Nonetheless I'm currently in therapy because it is still bad enough, so I can't really proceed with my studies.

Now, there a few general advices I can give. The first is concerning an intimate topic, but I'm going to be open anyway, you naturaly don't have to respond to this, if you don't want to. Well, if you're a regular consumer of internet pornography, especially if you're male, I would really recommend you to stop with it. Given you are a writer and most certainly a sophisticated person, I guess, you don't tend to engage in such things, but you never know, no offense of course. Maybe you heard of the Nofap community, if not, it's a project, which tries to help people get rid of porn consumption. I don't want to delve to deep into this topic, you can inform yourself for example on r/NoFap. The second thing is, try to eat healthy. Of course this gets difficult, when you fear the situation of cooking. I've to admit, I don't seem to get, why this situation is frightening for you, you'd have to elaborate on that. You wrote, that you instead eat a lot of ready made meals, I would recommend you to create a situation were you get freshly cooked meals, it's in my opinion very important to eat wholesome meals, especially when you are a sensitive person, what you seem to be. Of course, alcohol and caffein can have a bad effect on your nerves and general well being in the long run, so I would stop to consume it, if you do, or at least make a pause of a few weeks. Next point is physical activity. It's a huge thing I think, again especially for sensitive people. Often, exactly those tend to be interested only in mental activities, but in my opinion it's essential to use your body. Evolutionary, we're not made to be coach potatoes. Even if you don't like exercise or sports, try to find something, which is fun for you. This is maybe also a difficult thing having the condition of fibromyalgia (I made a quick google search). But I read recently, exercise, especially weight training, can help reduce pain sensitivity. I would talk with you doctor and/or therapist about that. And last but not least, sleep. To have a normal day and night cyle also effects your whole physiology. Also, every hour you're going to bed before midnight has double the recovering effect on your body. Try to make changes in those fields, if possible. If you already lead a very healthy lifestyle, you can of course respond to me, then I try to go more into psycological tricks, which help me at times."
getdisciplined,fdjxmxo,t3_eld88t,1578490730.0,"This is a very interesting topic to discuss regarding self discipline. I played Rugby for a few years, before I stopped 4 years ago and had the luck to be trained by very different types of coaches. Some tried to get the best out of us players by lifting us up and some, especially one, by being punishing, especially one. He was a high ranking officer in the Army and believed mental pressure gives the best results. But because of him, nearly a whole genereation of players stopped playing, I'm in doubt, how effective his methods were in the end. 

Seeing that you are a coach and certainly more experienced in motivating people than I will ever be, I think you are right. The way we were raised, the way our society works, even a large part of our western culture is defined by overcoming through self punishment, think of christian values etc. So, I agree on what you say,  a change of perspective is needed, in changing ones life in the long run. Despite, I guess, that there are life situations, were one has to be hard to oneself and there is no way around it. I'm speaking of short term crisis situations, like overcoming drug addiction or survival situations like the one showed in the movie ""Touching the Void"", were there is no way to be kind to yourself. Maybe it is also good to be prepared for such situations. What do you think about that?"
NoFap,f7nmpl9,t3_dwk9uk,1573910581.0,"First, I have to congratulate you, you lasted an extremely long time!!!

Now, just as a quick reminder, the Nofap theory says after 120 days of abstaining from any sex related activity, you are rebooted. This means, your brain restructured itself neuro-psychologicaly. This may probably take longer or shorter depending on the person. Anyway, after 800+ days NoPMO you are surely rebooted!!

Then I have to clarify, that I distinguish between masturbation with and without porn. The first one is detrimental, the latter only when your not rebooted yet. The reason for it being the enforced connection of your lust centre to your visual centre, when your porn addicted, so you either only get off with porn or you start to phantasize porn scenes instead of real life situations, while masturbating without porn.

Now, I would ask you, if you have had any sexual relationship during this time. It's of course best to have a sexual outlet of some sort, unless you decide to take the path of a serious spiritual initiation process or similar, where you spend most of your time learning to control your feelings etc., that would be going monk mode in Nofap terms. Otherwise it is only a question of time, until you relapse or you surpressed feelings will show in a bad way, either agression of depression, which actually is what NoFap should get you away from. Judging from the expressions you used in your post, I'd say, that you propably hate yourself too much for masturbating. In my opinion, it's better to accept failure or embrace it even to some extent, but still retain a stoic attitude while doing that."
