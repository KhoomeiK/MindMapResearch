And I call for actually slaughtering the rich and the police that enforce the will of a corrupt state. Hang their fucking heads on stakes."
TheRightCantMeme,ffp2jr0,t1_ffp19kd,1580084895.0,"I guess I'm just annoyed by all the shit slinging. I don't read right wing subs because I'd rather avoid all the dumb ass insults. And with as much as the reddit librals try to claim their some moral superiority they say just as many vile insults.

Calling someone a pedophile with no evidence is just as low as the sexist shit they say. It's a serious fucking accusation. It's littraly the last thing I'd want to be accused of. I feel some fucking discretion of its use is appropriate."
TheRightCantMeme,ffp1d2g,t1_ffowxxx,1580084279.0,"If you call a 21yo who fucks a 17yo the same thing as you call a 40yo who rapes an 6yo then aren't you kinda minimizing what the second dude did? 

I guess looking at the dictionary definition it's defined as anyone under 18. I was in juvie from 15-17 then lived in my own and 100% independent since I was 17, so I probably have a skewed perception of the maturity of the average teen. Hmmm.

So yeah, I'm not banging 16 year olds but i do feel that 16+ is less creepy and severe than <16. And honestly I feel like ages 16-20 is another group. An 18/19yo isn't any more of a adult than a 16yo."
