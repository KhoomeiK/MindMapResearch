Cardinal and Skylight are wonderful albums, but to me this is absolutely their best work. I really love how they managed to increase overall production quality while maintaining their signature organic sound. Guitar tones are stunning and drums are tighter than ever. I’ve forced myself to stop listening for a couple days so I don’t overdo it, but the CD arrives today so I guess ten or fifteen more times won’t hurt."
