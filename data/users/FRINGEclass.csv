LosAngeles,ffpgecn,t1_ffpg86n,1580094400.0,You do realize he wasn’t charged with anything right? The accuser and her lawyers dropped the case because she didn’t want to testify. But guilty until proven innocent?

AdviceAnimals,ffk1bxx,t1_ffj1nhv,1580012789.0,This is Reddit. 50% of users are introverts/trolls or just the depressed and the other 50% can have crossovers but just lead your average normal life. The Introverts believe nothing ever happens.

IdiotsInCars,ffjn7ov,t1_ffjn161,1580002146.0,"Yeah, not buying it based on your account."
IdiotsInCars,ffjmg1c,t1_ffjlj4k,1580001629.0,Fucked up thing is I’m sure the shock doesn’t even let you comprehend what had just transpired. Because if it did I’m sure you would rather just went with that quick death. Maybe that’s why it does it. So you’re not frantic.
IdiotsInCars,ffjl1kp,t1_ffjhp3s,1580000677.0,Fucked up story but yeah that’s how scary fragile life is.
IdiotsInCars,ffizfv1,t1_ffiqim0,1579986528.0,Him moving still isn’t an indication that he’ll survive. Could have some serious internal bleeding.

aww,ffh92i9,t3_eth9ik,1579926634.0,That guys rude as hell. His parents never taught him not to stare at people.

nextfuckinglevel,ffgacl9,t1_ffe12an,1579901883.0,You do realize you’re agreeing with me right? I said that this particular facet of TKD is for entertainment but they do teach legitimate stuff for combat sports.
PS4,ffecgbc,t1_ffd8736,1579843034.0,Yeah. I can only speak for myself but I’ve blight EVERY Nintendo Console and every PlayStation console. Xbox just never had enough to push me to buy their product

gaming,ffebzk4,t1_ffe48n6,1579842605.0,"Yeah, thought the same exact thing. If I was a single dude living with my parents I’d fucking get a boner over this but I’m not exactly keen on allocating a decent sum of money locked into a gift card at GameStop. To each his own."
gaming,ffebfnz,t3_et3n2x,1579842102.0,Perfect if you’re a hardcore gamer. Silly if you’re not since you’re stuck with all the allocated funds stuck within GameStop gift cards.
nextfuckinglevel,ffduqgv,t1_ffdh4tv,1579829409.0,You watch too much anime.
nextfuckinglevel,ffdulpv,t1_ffdlcjt,1579829316.0,Ah yes to another McDojo
nextfuckinglevel,ffdug96,t1_ffd6ddw,1579829209.0,"Your mixing this facet of TKD(athletics/entertainment) with the actual combat sport. TKD is practical, this isn’t."
nextfuckinglevel,ffdubgg,t1_ffdslmw,1579829115.0,The original commenter is right. It’s merely athletics/entertainment and not practical in any combat sport. That’s why you don’t see it in competition or any mixed martial art

holdmyredbull,ff52ot4,t1_ff4h60n,1579578590.0,"Same, when I was younger I had a few manual labor type jobs and since I was in my late teens/ early twenties I didn’t ANYBODY’s help. A very “I got the bro don’t worry. It’s not even that heavy” even if it’s not never be THAT guy. I felt young and strong and now I’m paying for that now.
