I'm no longer religious but I still haven't said anything considered blasphemy due to an irrational fear. It was ingrained in me since a child so at this point I don't really care."

Hopefully she'll grow out of it because I am tired of getting scratched."

relationships,ffc9svo,t3_esit2d,1579794792.0,"I just turned 25 this week and wow have I learned a lot in my twenties!

I used to say that age didn't matter so long as we were both adults(ie no minors). Cue lots of men 30+ later,I came to realize that it does. 

I'm pretty average looking and a bit chubby so I thought I was safe from men who only wanted a younger woman. Boy,was I wrong! Every single person I dated or was FWB with(above 30)was an abuser. I've slept with at least 100 people since I was 18 and only two were near my age(one is my current fiance). 

You need to be wary of someone 10 years older than you who is interested. If they're not in the same decade as you then give them a hard pass for now. 

People still view us as young,naive ""supple"" sex toys and want a taste. It's pretty sickening, honestly. I had so much bad luck with people but I didn't realize it was my own errors until stepping back. Sure,they shouldn't have been awful people but I also trusted way more than I should have(and thought I was being careful at the same time).

Tl;dr **DON'T DATE OUT OF YOUR DECADE**"
wowthanksimcured,ffc8fo9,t3_esqcj6,1579793919.0,"Well,it's true in my case. I am ADHD and it's like this disorder gets in the way of who I actually am. Even with medication and therapy,it's a long road and battle to just be myself."
destiny2,ffc87gp,t3_esnlz0,1579793772.0,"This is part of why I love destiny. Most of the players treat each other like humans,versus what some other people do in popular games. 

I never see people calling each other slur words and when there is a game(like the tire game)people line up instead of trying to overtake it."
AskMen,ffc7rf3,t3_esruuu,1579793487.0,My fiance and I have been discussing alternatives to rings since we're both very forgetful. He bought us rings and we both lost them within a week... So far all we have done up with is putting rings on necklaces but then he broke his necklace chain. Soooo now we're sharing a necklace hahah!
childfree,feypyuk,t3_eqr4py,1579449057.0,"People really don't take the age gap seriously. My oldest sibling is 13 years ahead of me and we're light years apart in terms of life stages. She has kids,went through a divorce,and multiple careers. I'm only just now moving out to live on my own and still deciding what career path to choose.

My SO's closest sibling(in terms of ages) is over 20 years apart from him. His mom had him in her 40's and she's in her golden years now. He already lost his dad when in college and nobody should go through that. 

Neither of us are close to our siblings but boy have we tried! It's just not possible because in their eyes, we're still kids. The gap is too much and we'll never have anything in common,ya know? One of my sorta siblings got close to our oldest sister when she started having kids at 15. They finally had something in common but I'll be damned if I have children lol. It's very sad and I wish it was different but ah well."

relationships,fegyjnu,t3_ep0gfb,1579105379.0,"I've dealt with severe depression and anxiety my entire life and I have a fiance. 

He helped me understand that I needed to be on medication and that it was worth the effort. I didn't want to go back on medication because I'd have to try multiple ones but... It's better than being curled up in a ball,in my room,sobbing with panic attacks. It's better than constantly being paranoid about everything,everyone,and the world. 

Medication helped me realize that I was always at an 8 when without it(meds),I just thought a 5 at most. My fear kept me from taking action so I could live a better life and it almost destroyed our relationship. He told me that so long as I make a real effort to be better then he could never leave me. 

So I tried working out and discovered that I love weight training. You feel your body physically getting stronger by the week so you start to feel less helpless. Boxing made me feel less out of control. I had to give up my gym membership due to finances but that didn't mean I had to quit exercising so I started walking. 

It was absolutely terrifying but now everyone in the neighborhood knows me. They wave,I wave, sometimes we chat. I pet all the dogs and kitties and they know my fiance,too. It helped me feel more secure in my environment because I live in a not-so-great area. 

I am still trying to find the medication that works best for me but the side effects are worth not being terrified 24/7. The worst part is that my mind normalized so much of it that I genuinely didn't know how bad it really was. 

I also can't afford consistent therapy sessions but I love watching videos on YouTube from real therapists. Kati Morton has tons of videos on identifying,learning about,and how to cope with certain disorders. She taught me many coping skills for my anxiety episodes and also what medications I should talk to my doctor about since I'm also ADHD. Of course,she always recommends seeing a doctor but being educated is important,too.

What got to me in the beginning is that I wanted to be better and be better quickly. I wanted to be normal,ya know? We have to understand that we'll always be a bit different and that's ok. What matters is that we're trying,we haven't given up,and that we believe in ourselves. We're on a journey that will probably take our entire lives to fulfill *but that's ok*. 

It's also important to acknowledge your improvements,no matter how small they seem. It's progress and progress is *good*!"
cats,fegwujo,t3_ep0qqu,1579104315.0,Mak sure she is spayed. Your local area may have a TNR program that gets her spayed and updated shots for free.
TrollXChromosomes,feghv46,t3_eoyue5,1579093250.0,As a kid I always got mad when adults did this so I slouched even more and man spread more! The only exception is it I was wearing a skirt that was higher than knee length.
relationships,fedqe72,t3_eoktfj,1579017630.0,"My fiance and I were like this. We had great chemistry but I was with someone at the time and genuinely wanted a friend. So we stayed friends until things got too awkward... Many months later we caught up again and months after that,we were a couple. 

We messaged each other at the same time,with the same thing,on the same platform. It was pretty funny since we hadn't talked in so long! 

We actually clashed for the first six months we were together but we both felt like there was just this uncanny chemistry,and we couldn't let go. After many talks,honest communication,and willingness to learn,we synced beautifully."
gainesvillega,fedpg02,t1_febhwoe,1579017038.0,"Thanks! It seems that most apartments are full right now, through. We ended up finding a place that rents month to month and we'll be there until I can find a job.

IllegallySmolCats,fe2118o,t1_fe01gd9,1578833369.0,"A stray jumped into my parents car some years ago. My dad was angry and he was even angrier when two kittens popped out a week later. 

Cue to him meeting the kittens,taking the bigger one to whisper,"" I'm gonna make you so fat""in it's ear. He did indeed make it fat."

relationship_advice,fdtzkoi,t3_en2psv,1578724869.0,"Growing up,my neighbor had family around our age. One day the mother of his closest cousin came home a sobbing mess because her husband... Shook the baby. He didn't have experience with kids but he did have a temper so he shook the infant when he got pissed. The baby wouldn't stop crying but she went limp after he shook her... Because he had fucked up her brain. She went from a normal infant girl to a critically disabled baby within moments. She grew up forever disabled(mentally and physically), because of a split second fit of anger he caused. 


I lost my first ever best friend when I was a little girl because of a different failure father. He had drinking problems but ""never around the kids"". I was supposed to be in the car that crashed,killing her. I don't remember why I didn't go but it 100% saved my life. She wasn't in her car seat and he was just under the influence enough to not respond quickly on the road. 

I still remember being upset because I thought she didn't want to be my friend anymore despite people trying to help understand she was dead. It was only when my sister described how she died that I started to get it... My sister meant well but definitely too graphic for your four year old sister. The car flipped,rolled,and tossed her little body out of the car where it flew onto the asphalt,many yards away. She died on impact but it definitely was a gnarly way to go. 

A parent should always trust their gut."
AskWomen,fdtwq0h,t3_emxwr1,1578723453.0,I turned them all down. Said they weren't my type and it pissed them off. They had never shown interest in me before so I didn't trust that they were genuine.
