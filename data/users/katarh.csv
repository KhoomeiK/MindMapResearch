We had plans to visit a friend for lunar new year this weekend (she organized it for her non-Asian friends so we could help her celebrate since her mother died last year) but now we're having second thoughts with a 2nd case being confirmed in the US."
PoliticalDiscussion,ffg5232,t1_ffg31p0,1579898619.0,"It is the government's fault for letting the restaurant industry high the true calorie content of their food for so long.

I was at Chili's the other day.  The only thing I could fit into my diet was the enchilada soup (about 400 calories.)  So many plates were over a thousand calories!  If you had an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert, and a drink, even if you split it with a second person, you'd still go far beyond your TDEE unless you were a fairly active person. 

Having the forced calorie counts on menus may  not stop the obesity trend, but it makes cutting down or maintaining easier for those who care to use the data."
PoliticalDiscussion,ffg4jcv,t3_etbq3p,1579898301.0,"The biggest problem isn't just the nutrition profile of any given food.  **It's the calorie content.**  

The tax should scale based on pure caloric density.  

Fresh or unprocessed foods are always untaxed.  (If it doesn't have a nutrition label on it, like an apple, it wouldn't be taxed.)

For any given processed foods, the first 100 calories are free.  So a 100 calorie snack bag would not be taxed.  Apple slices or carrot sticks would not be taxed.  A cup of skim milk would not be taxed.  Diet soda would not be taxed.

For every 100 calories beyond that, tax a *nickel.*  So a 180 calorie pack of crackers gets an extra 5 cents tacked on.  A  thousand calorie hamburger will get a 50 cent tax.  A whole pizza, which is approximately 2000 calories for 8 slices, has to pay an extra dollar.

This method is possible because of the new USDA requirement that says for a multi serving size processed food with ingredients on it, you must display the caloric content of the entire box or bag!  Boom, 5% of that is your taxed amount."

Tenured full professors? They're in the ""fuck it here's an extra reading assignment"" category.

Most profs deliberately build a fudge day or two into their syllabus, because they know they might have to take a sick day themselves, or there might be inclement weather, etc."
CFB,fenyag0,t1_fenua43,1579292599.0,"Depends on how the profs are grading the classes.  Like for engineering or calculus, if they remove all credit for a wrong answer, then more people are going to have bad grades.... But if they give partial credit for ""right equation, wrong answer, here's your mistake"" then many people will have higher grades.  The problem is that grading that way requires a lot more time and attention for each test, so profs will opt for the lazier method of knocking off the entire question for a wrong answer and then having a massive curve at the end of the class to make up for it."
