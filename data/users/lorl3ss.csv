The people who get along fine, share housework and generally have a good time aren't typically coming on here to shout about it because it's not frustrating. I guess what I'm saying is maybe you are only seeing the bad because the good doesn't tend to get talked about as much."

Hell fucking no. Being isolated away from your support networks and friends while having severe mental issues is not fun. University is a breeding ground for stress and burnout, anxiety and depression. It's the first time many of us have lived away from home and we haven't got a clue how to take care of ourselves. 

Sure there are fun parts but it's fucking hard too."

1 minute wiping tears away"
BattlefieldV,fdqc6i5,t1_fdqas05,1578662685.0,Tbh I don't feel that the current tanks are that tanky at all but maybe I'm just crap. I haven't played much at all since 5.2. it's too frustrating.
BattlefieldV,fdqc481,t1_fdqbgt6,1578662630.0,Yeah i was really disappointed with their damage output as well
BattlefieldV,fdqc1v3,t1_fdqbjfw,1578662575.0,"Interesting. Would you do the same for planes too? 

Yeah I hate that every fight is a close quarters who can start spamming first contest. Make the game feel far more twitchy than the slower paced fire, move up, find cover, fire move up approach."
BattlefieldV,fdqapm0,t1_fdqaatj,1578661373.0,Sure. There are lots of ways to handle it. My preference is for tanks to be tanky and require some concentrated effort to destroy them but other ways can be fun too. Just needs proper balancing.
BattlefieldV,fdqa48z,t1_fdq9v3l,1578660817.0,"Yup still true, I'd counter by saying there are other ways to kill tanks. Field guns, other tanks, planes etc etc

I feel like the alternative is that everyone has a way to counter a tank at any moment and tanks become useless."
BattlefieldV,fdq8w6a,t1_fdq2u74,1578659619.0,Not fine but it was far better than what we have now.
BattlefieldV,fdq8twg,t1_fdq5pqr,1578659555.0,"This is true but i feel its necessary. I dunno... I feel like tanks should be well... dangerous. I get that it kills the pacing but the average infantry man should run like hell from a tank, it makes the game far more dynamic. You can use a tank to push an area fairly easily but it will get murdered by well placed anti-tank infantry. Seems like good gameplay to me."
BattlefieldV,fdq8nyx,t1_fdq5zie,1578659385.0,"Where the hell is this positive feedback i'd like to know. It seems like the last 100 posts on this sub have been some flavour of ""Revert the ttk/5.2"""

BattlefieldV,fdnh1ls,t1_fdn28g9,1578585636.0,"Just adding my 'me too' as well. 

I picked bf5 up a few months before the 5.2 ttk patch and absolutely loved it. It had its problems but gunplay was fun and chaotic, mistakes were punished and i learnt to play better as a result. I absolutely loved that my submachine gun could compete with a bolt action if i controlled my recoil properly. I could effectively suppress snipers because of the damage i could inflict even at greater ranges. I didnt always kill a sniper but I could make damn sure he wasn't popping his head back out which was usually enough time for me to get away. 

Now bolt actions take three or 4 shots to the body, laugh, shrug it off and fucking headshot me. It feels cheap and exploity, I am not rewarded for my careful recoil control and suppressive fire, my gun feels useless and innacurate and worst of all I don't feel like im playing a serious war game anymore. It feels way too arcadey, it doesnt feel satisfying when i kill someone because i had to spend half a clip, usually by which time i get spotted and engaged by someone else so i also get destroyed vs multiple opponents. My skills, quick thinking and good aim count for nothing because it takes too long to kill someone for me to then engage another target, by the time i have killed the first guy im already being shot. Its awful."

Frostpunk,fbap8n5,t3_ec7sos,1576683725.0,"A little tip to help you. You can save coal using the overdrive on the generator. Get the first generator power upgrade, set the generator to level 1 and turn on the overdrive. Presto, level 2 heating across the generator and steam hubs for as long as the overdrive can run for the coal price of level 1. Just watch the stress level...

If you want to really exploit this get to level 3 and get the overdrive coupling tech which raises heat by 2 levels when in overdrive. Set the generator to level 1, overdrive and you get level 3 heating for the price of level 1. Saves enourmous amounts of coal."
