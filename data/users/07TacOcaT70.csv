boomershumor,ff7mxwp,t1_ff7i48l,1579653392.0,"Uh I don’t think he’s literally their grandparent. It’s more of a term that can be both used endearingly and mockingly towards old people given context, mockingly in this case. You know like when close friends call eachother brother or sister, although idk if that’s done as much for native English speakers since I haven’t come across it much within the west."

boomershumor,ff6ipbi,t1_ff604q9,1579628045.0,"It would depend on who they were for me — personally, I’d find it quite funny and a bit embarrassing coming from close friends (even guys, since none of us feel hat way for each other) but if it was from an acquaintance or someone who’d said they were into me in the past (not like that’s gonna happen, but that’s the beauty of hypotheticals lol) I would be a bit weirded out. 

Still though, there’s a time and a place, and certain people you wouldn’t get this for even as a joke since they’d probably get really uncomfortable with it and not see the humour at all. However *personally* I’d probably find it quite funny."

Like there’s a difference between “when the school shooter starts killing people and the autistic kids starts fucking the teacher with the class pet” which is clearly trying to be only shocking and not funny, there’s no punch line and something which has a punchline indicating it was supposed to be a joke.

You can make derogatory jokes about darker subjects and people might give you backlash, but it’s still intended as a joke and has a punchline which is what makes the difference.

Offensive humour with punchline and just being offensive are different, that’s what this sub is meant for, the people just being offensive/edgy."

As I said the hair could just be dyed but I suppose lighting could be the change too, so I was just mentioning it *could* be something. However her height it different. In the first image it’s a woman wearing trainers, which give you a boost in height and in the second image it’s a woman wearing flip flops or sandals that could at best give her the same height as in the first picture.

Also 6 months is possible for that weight loss if you work *hard* so it could be her, but her height wouldn’t change."

Idk maybe it could kill you or it’s dependant on which type of plastic it is, but even when I’ve looked it up before, (out of concern) nothing about eating plastic has listed death under the side effects when it’s been a small amount. Liver damage was a long term effect if you keep doing it though if I remember correctly.
