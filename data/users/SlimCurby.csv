I think it's good that people are aware of how bad slavery was, it's good we remember so we don't end up repeating that, ever. And the confederates weren't heroes, anyone that deems them as that is not thinking straight. Also, the statues that were built in these general's and other confederate people's honor was quite long ago. They are history and they should be preserved. The statue of Andrew Jackson in Jackson Square was put there in 1856, and it was to reference his great work in the Battle of New Orleans. He didn't fight in the civil war. He died in 1845, over a decade before it. And it's true that people don't get there history from statues, the statues are a piece of the history being taught by the classes you speak of. Finally, history is very much doomed to repeat itself when children are indoctrinated with hate. But the thing is, all across America, any kid that goes to a public school is taught that slavery was bad and so is racism, sexism, etc. Hate isn't apart of our culture, gumbo and fishing is."
