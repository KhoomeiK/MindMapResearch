I often feel lonely, when I post here is also trying not to feel this way, to feel that there's people going throught something similar to what I am and have some advices. ( I don't post about feelings with this account, have a secundary one)

Really nice of you saying these words, I hope I can find someone like this IRL someday, cause today no one really cares about me."

Do you want to get ghosted again in the future? If he really loves you he'd have stayed by your side in that difficult moment you had."

offmychest,fcyin3a,t3_ejeob2,1578080665.0,"I totally feel you man. I've been thinking about suicide for months, but I wished BADLY I was dead last 2 weeks of december.. every day thinking about suicide and all.Loneliness, financial troubles, non existent self esteem, etc. I spent all these days drinking, playing and sleeping since I was in my job's vacation. 

That only got better yesterday when I traveled outside my city to see my online friend (which I may have a platonic love) and beeing with her made my day feel really great.But yesterday is not today so I didn't stopped thinking about it, but it's better. I know it will cause much pain to her, my family and people around me like my coworkers, and muay thai felas... So at least I am saving grief and pain for them. That's the only thing keeping me from doing it. Don't want my last action  to be cause pain to others. Let's see until when I can handle it. 2 years since the first time I really considered it.

My point is: try to have friends, they really help. They distract your mind, make you feel  better, etc.

Oh, and the lack of a firearm too."

AskMen,fcsz2b5,t3_eij5mq,1577928696.0,"Well, I am a man, I always have talked to my girfriends in the past everyday. Maybe 1 or 2 days in years without talking, only if there was a huge emergency.

Even today I have this female best friend that I text good morning and send some meme if there's nothing relevant to say, every single day.  
Your SO is weird, IMO."
AskMen,fcl4hrb,t3_ehkmc3,1577739622.0,"As a man, with a girl I can discuss feelings in a more confortable way. Tell how I really feel and get tips about how to deal with it, instead of just ""lets go out do something to forget"" which is more commom with male friends. And about family problems aswell"
brasilivre,fbv6zbx,t3_eelqgm,1577126537.0,E desde quando tem tanto brasileiro bilingue assim?
