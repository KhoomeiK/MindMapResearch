trashy,ffh44yn,t1_ffh39cr,1579922603.0,It’s hard to know sometimes.  Many people will buy artwork from other sellers and then sell it and copy the description and tags word for word.  Reverse image search could maybe help you see where the image has been posted and if multiple people are posting it...
AskReddit,ffgducg,t1_ffeqgpx,1579904030.0,"I like how the show Supernatural depicts angels...as righteous warriors that will uphold God’s will by whatever brutal means necessary.  Growing up Southern Baptist, we were taught that angels were graceful and peacefully watching over us.  It’s interesting how some denominations of Christianity gloss over some of the brutality in the Bible and have such an overly positive, cherub-y view...and then others fully embrace the brutality and have a “you’re fucked and you better get into heaven or else” mentality.  I don’t know which is worse... I just find the history and interpretations interesting."
DecidingToBeBetter,ffgbxss,t3_etc1bt,1579902853.0,"I don’t know if it helps at all, but I graduated with less than a 3.0 gpa in undergrad, and I ended up becoming a lecturer.  I had always planned to go to grad school, but I didn’t do well during my first years in undergrad.  I didn’t have a support system at all (I ran way from my abusive mother who wanted me to be a housewife), so I felt like I didn’t know what I was doing.  I was very studious in high school, but I was just lost during college.  My dad tried to help, but he didn’t have a degree, so he didn’t know what to expect or what the college experience was like.  I didn’t have good advisors to help me plan my future.  I was basically on my own.  I didn’t know what I wanted to do for a career.  On top of that, I had been dealing with a chronic pain condition that wasn’t diagnosed at the time, so I missed class too frequently.  Eventually, I figured out what I wanted to do, got a diagnosis, and my grades improved, but my gpa was still low.  Most grad schools denied me because of my gpa.  I got into a masters program at a state school.  I worked hard and did really well in my classes.  I networked, presented at professional conferences, and worked as a graduate assistant.  I ended up winning an award for my thesis research, did research professionally for a while, and then became a lecturer.

You can definitely make a come-back!  Some people are fortunate enough to go through college without having anything major happen that impacts their grades.  But for many people, life happens.  The best thing you can do is learn from it, and try to grow as a person.  You can’t change the past, but you can figure out where to go from here.  Good luck!"
trashy,ffg4gsu,t1_fffs28o,1579898259.0,"It’s like this with Etsy, too (I’m a seller there).  Etsy now prioritizes items with free shipping, so you’re kind of forced to include the shipping in your price to be ranked higher.  But then you need to raise your prices to compensate, but you’re competing with others who have lower prices.  Nowadays, there’s a ton of stolen products and products just bought from other sellers and resold for a higher price, so it can be hard for legitimate sellers to compete.  If you get a certain amount of customer complaints, you will just get banned from Etsy with no warning, and your shop is deleted.  It’s brutal.  I’ve heard of top sellers that had been on Etsy for 10 years get their shop removed with no warning or explanation.  Selling on platforms like this is really hard nowadays, as these companies are jut getting stricter with their requirements."
Professors,ff49g8y,t3_ergbew,1579558442.0,"What class do you teach?   The way I approach it is that I need to do something to make it “worth it” to attend class, for their grade and what they get out of the class.  If all we do in class is go over the same material in the textbook, there’s not much motivation for them to go.  

Instead, I try to incorporate a lot of case studies, ethical dilemmas, interesting film clips about relevant research, and hands-on activities that they won’t get from reading the text alone.  I teach physical anthropology, so they often work with skull models and real human skeletal remains, which builds excitement.

I know it’s hard with larger class sizes, but it isn’t impossible.  If there’s a way to make things more hands-on, that’s what I’d recommend.  What do you want YOUR experience with the class to be?  Do you care about how well they understand the material, despite attendance?  If that’s your goal, then attendance shouldn’t a big deal, as long as they’re getting the material and passing evaluation.  Are you worried about grade grubbing, and that’s why attendance is an issue?  Then maybe you need to restructure your policies and have mandatory in-class assignments.  Do you want students to enjoy the class or care about the material?  Then you may need to restructure your class to get them more interested in it.  Hope this advice helps!"

college,fef8gif,t3_eosk6j,1579050658.0,"As a prof, I would recommend contacting your instructors and letting them know about your health situation (they don't need to know all the details, just that you are experiencing constant asthma attacks).  See if there's anything you can make up or anything you can do to keep your grade from being severely affected.  You might want to consider getting a doctor's note about your condition.  If it's a serious health issue, profs are required to provide make-up options.

Your health is your #1 priority right now.  If you need to take an Incomplete for the class and finish it later, you can likely do that.  It's better to take an Incomplete and finish it later than to fail a class because of health issues."

college,feef6ml,t3_eomxga,1579032505.0,"As a lecturer, it’s normal for people to change their minds about their major.  I changed my mind multiple times.  I thought about being an English teacher, some kind of medical professional, then Science teacher...then felt I wanted to teach, but I didn’t know what subject.  Then I majored in anthropology.  I feel a little embarrassed to admit it, but the show Bones is what made me interested in physical anthropology.  I also realized that I always enjoyed biology and geology in addition to being fascinated by human behavior and forensics.  So, I went into a discipline that involved all of these subjects.

Really think about what you enjoy doing and, most importantly, what you DON’T enjoy.  Maybe even research some “underrated” jobs and see what’s out there that you never knew about.  I never wanted to be in a corporate environment, so I explicitly tried to find a career that was more flexible and gave me some freedom to do what I want.  I also realized I don’t like writing and doing research, even though I’m good at it.  So, I just focused on teaching.  It’s okay to have standards for what you want and don’t want.  You could take some classes in different disciplines to see how you like them.  

Finally, really research what salaries are like and what competition is like in the fields you’re interested in.  Disciplines like Computer Science, Engineering, and Business can be highly competitive.  Do some soul-searching and research."
college,fea2g5v,t3_eo50o7,1578943703.0,"I don’t know if you have already, but double check when your final exams are, in case there are any conflicts.  Final exams tend to be on a different schedule."
college,fdzxlic,t3_en37wi,1578798269.0,"I became a professor because of this problem.  I had way too many dry, lecture-format classes with condescending instructors growing up.  An instructor I had for a communications class really inspired me to push boundaries outside of traditional lecture-style courses and have students involved more in the content.  Many of my students have told me they have had this problem with not retaining info, as well.

My advice would be to specifically seek out good instructors.  Get recommendations from friends.  Check Rate My Professor.  Figure out what kind of learning styles you like.  It's true that a bad instructor can make you hate an interesting subject while a good instructor would make you interested in a subject you never cared for...I believe most students I have had tend to prefer hands-on, discussion-based, student-centered learning rather than lecture formats.  Is it similar for you?

It depends on your major and the classes you need, of course.  If you have the freedom to choose from a variety of different subjects, find good classes and good instructors that will actually teach you valuable skills in a hands-on way.

I may be biased, but I teach physical anthropology, and it's an interesting field to learn about.  It's a really fun class, and students seem to enjoy the field.  Basically, it's about human evolution (covers everything from evolution to primatology to human behavior).  It also tends to include osteology and there are lab sections with human skeletal remains.  I absolutely love teaching this discipline.  It's an underrated but valuable science to learn about.  You'd be surprised what you can learn in disciplines that you don't know much about.  Sometimes just exploring a completely different topic can open your mind...

Good luck with everything and hang in there."
Teachers,fdquoe6,t1_fdqnd04,1578675166.0,"This is exactly the issue.  When we were growing up, computers were somewhat new.  So we needed to take classes to learn how to use them.  Also, computer technology is a lot more user-friendly today compared to the things we had to know how to do.  

Nowadays, we just assume that kids know how to do the exact same things we knew how to do, but they aren’t being taught these skills.  We need to actively teach them rather than complain about them not knowing."
Advice,fdl6bm9,t1_fdkzkep,1578517788.0,"I’ve heard that this kind of behavior is common in trans people.  Many want to rewrite their past as the opposite gender and pretend that they have never experienced it in the first place because it makes them feel like a fraud.  I know a trans female who buys pads and simulates a period even though she doesn’t get one.  It’s kind of weird, but I can only imagine how difficult it must be for trans people.  They have very high suicide rates (even those who do transition).  Many actually revert back after transitioning because they just don’t feel like changing their body made enough of an impact.  Even after going through a transformation, it doesn’t change your history, and it can be hard to cope with if you don’t accept your past.  I would be very careful in how you approach this, OP.  Not that you would, but don’t say anything along the lines of “you were never born a woman, you’re just pretending to not know these things.”  That can do some real damage.  

Is she getting any kind of therapy?  You can’t just transition and expect to completely adapt.  She likely needs it so she can learn to be in her body now.  Hopefully, it can help her accept the fact that she was born the wrong gender without numbing herself to her past experiences and pretending it didn’t happen.  I know trans people who went through the transformation and then decided to not have a complete transformation anymore and be gender fluid.  Before ideas of being gender fluid were understood, trans people often felt the need to choose between being a really feminine woman or a really masculine man, which meant rejecting any part of yourself that aligns with the opposite category.  So people would often “go all out” when transitioning to another gender.  That sounds like what she’s doing.  She needs to learn who she is without gender associations, and this might take some time."

When I taught SAT and ACT writing classes, I would sometimes have quick jeopardy games about grammar rules.  I sometimes have debate questions and have them use persuasive language to debate an issue.  Or I have them first use purely objective language and then use persuasive language next class.  

You could also have exercises where they look at some kind of ineffective written communication (emails, bad research proposals) and have them talk about all the problems in the way these fictional people conveyed their messages."

I also have review sessions before the exams.  I make a crossword and let them work on it in class (usually takes half the class period).  And this year I’m trying out 2 “scenarios”...where they’ll have some kind of problem-solving activity they’ll work on all class period.
