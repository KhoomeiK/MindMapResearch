whatisthisthing,ff28s87,t3_er8hcd,1579497143.0,"The house was built in 1927. Northern New Jersey. At first I guessed it was some kind of primitive smoke detector or carbon monoxide alarm, because it's kind of near the furnace. But inside there's a battery which expired in 1997. I was alive then, and smoke detectors definitely didn't look like this. There's no writing except ""made in Hong Kong"" on the back."
jerseycity,ff1ylcp,t3_er34lq,1579489170.0,"I lived at the Gotham for 5 years, up until a month ago when I moved because I bought a house. Best living experience of my life, excellent staff, location, and facilities. 10/10 would recommend. My favorite thing was how good they were about fixes and maintenance (at least in the apartment, less so in common areas). I actually think with the recent gym renovation and ongoing patio renovation they're pretty much on par now with other semi-luxury buildings in town. The only thing missing is a pool, but for me that's totally unimportant. 

In no particular order, some of my favorite features: unbelievable amount of light (too much actually, I put up curtains), dry cleaner with light tailoring across the street, pizza and indian food across the street, deli and steak house in the building, attached garage, fios internet, package delivery concierge, dog run (looked sad at first, but I grew to love it in time), doggy daycare 2 blocks away, laundry in unit, rent increases were never more than national inflation, which actually means rent went down some years in terms of real purchasing power, THICK concrete floors and ceilings for sound blocking (walls, less so), lots of cute dogs in the building, close to everything, unusually large bathroom, UPS/Fedex drop off on site with concierge. It's cool that there's a children's daycare in the building, but I don't have kids so I can't speak to that. 

My biggest complaint is not so much with the building but the neighborhood: fucking car alarms constantly, just relentless, drove me insane. But, that seems to be true across the whole nyc metro area, so what can you do? Some other complaints, in no particular order: elevators break a lot, but never all of them at once, so I guess it's not too bad. About 4 times a year we'd have false alarm fire evacuations due to people cooking, a couple of times in the middle of the night, which suuuuucked. Door people just let anyone walk in, there's no getting buzzed in, so there's arguably less security than a building with a locked door and no door guy. Litter in the neighborhood, traffic in the neighborhood, dog poop in the neighborhood (again, not the building's fault, and true throughout the whole city).

Edit: also, there's a doctor's practice in the building and a dentist two doors down. Hella convenient."

On the other, other, other hand are we really gonna get bent out of shape about a fucking scifi character?

Plenty of folks are unpersuadable bigots, sure, but plenty more are simply confused old folk with no real experience of knowing and loving an openly gay person. Concepts which seem obvious to us (it's not a choice; it's not a phase; it's not a fetish) are completely alien to them. 

An honest conversation with an out gay person--or even just a reformed former bigot--really can be the first step in letting go of their old prejudices. If you shut that conversation down, you might succeed in silencing the bigot, but they go right on believing their bigotry is correct. Eventually, the bigot will encounter someone in authority who tells them that their bigotry is right, and that they're being persecuted for their beliefs. What do you think the bigot will do with that message?

I don't know if any of this applies to OP honestly, but I think it's important in general to provide spaces where bigots can explore and challenge the source of their prejudice. It might feel good to punish them, but if you want to convert them it's gonna take patience."
