In the year 1945, My great-grandfather, serving in the army, wondered when hed get to go home to his wife and the daughter he'd never seen. He got his wish when the US ended World War II by dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 

The world awaited Armageddon; instead, something miraculous happened. We began to use atomic energy not as a weapon, but as a nearly limitless source of power.

People enjoyed luxuries once thought in the realm of science fiction. Domestic robots, fusion-powered cars, portable computers. But then, in the 21st century, people awoke from the American dream.

Years of consumption lead to shortages of every major resource. The entire world unraveled. Peace became a distant memory. It is now the year 2077. We stand on the brink of total war, and I am afraid. For myself, For my husband, for my infant son - because if my time in the army taught me one thing: it's that war, war never changes.

I awoke to an empty bed, Nate must already be getting ready for his speech at the Veterans hall today. I yawned sliding out of the bed my bare feet hitting the cold floor. I walked into Shaun's room to see my beautiful baby boy still asleep in his crib, Codsworth remaining vigil over him. I smile placing a kiss on my baby's forehead feeling hands at my hips as kisses are placed on my neck.

""Good Morning beautiful."" Nate whispers in my ear making me smile as I turn to face him my arms wrapping around his neck.

""Morning."" I whisper back the back of my knuckles down the side of Nate's face.

""We should get out of here before we wake Shaun."" Nate mutters pulling me from the room his fingers intertwining with my own. Nate drags me to the bathroom allowing me to head for the shower as he goes to the mirror to brush his teeth and shave. I strip off my clothes before stepping inside the shower turning on the warm water allowing it to flow all over my body as I close my eyes raising my face to the water. Something feels wrong today, I can't explain it… But I have this feeling that I can only explain as pure fear consuming me.

""Hey, Hun! You alright in there?"" Nate's voice rings through the bathroom making me take a deep breath.

""Yeah! Haha, the water feels so good I just got a little carried away."" I murmur back placing one of my hands on the glass door steadying myself.

""Well hurry we can't be late today!"" Nate calls back happily making me grab the shampoo and conditioner massaging it through my dark red locks. I close my eyes as I rinse out the soap from my hair finally deeming myself worthy of stepping out of the shower. I reach for a towel blindly making Nate chuckle softly before handing me one. I use it to dry my hair and body before slipping into a beautiful rose colored dress I bought for the occasion.

""You have no idea how absolutely stunning you are Avery. I love you so much."" Nate says pulling me close his mouth claiming mine. I slide my hands up to his shoulders our tongues mingling together as our kisses become desperate…its almost as if Nate can feel it too. Something is going to happen today, I blink confused as Nate pulls away pecking my lips one last time before walking towards the mirror.

""I love you too Nate."" I whisper out just as Shaun starts crying.

""Don't worry about it babe, you focus on getting ready I'll take care of Shaun."" I smile as he walked out leaving me facing my own reflection. I quickly brush my teeth and brush my hair before I get started on my make-up. I make my eyeliner a bit thick so it makes my Steel colored eyes pop a bit more. I apply dark red lipstick to my lips followed by the same colored eye shadow before I walk out of the bathroom to Nate holding Shaun in the living room. Just as I am about to sit down the door bell rings making both Nate and I stare at the door. Nate sighs his eyes narrowing at the door.

""Its that Vault-tech guy again, he came yesterday I tried to talk to him but he said he'd only talk to you. You wanna get the door?"" Nate shakes his head as he continues rocking Shaun as Codsworth begins making him a bottle.

""Yeah."" I nod walking around the couch to open the door to a man in a tan trench coat and fedora. ""Good Morning Vault-Tech is calling. Ahhh… Finally Miss Avery I have been trying to get a hold of for some time now."" The man says with a nervous smile.

""Well it’s a good thing I opened the door then."" I reply a bit awkwardly.

""Well we just wanted to tell you that you and your family have been pre approved for a spot in our Vault all you need to do is fill out these forms."" The man hands me a clipboard and pen making me internally sigh before I start scrawling down all of our information.

""Here you are is that all?"" I question handing him back the clipboard. 

""Yes, Miss Avery that was all I needed, you have a good day now."" He says waving over his shoulder.

""Umm Goodbye then!"" I call out as I step back inside the house with a sigh.

""Hey, its peace of mind that’s worth a little paper work right?"" Nate murmurs handing Shaun off to Codsworth.

""For you and Shaun no price is too high."" I say with a smile making Nate chuckle.

""Good answer."" I lean forward placing a kiss on the crown of his head.

""I have my moments."" I whisper into his ear. Just then Shaun begins to cry.

""Miss Avery, Master Shaun completely refuses to calm down I think he wishes for some of that maternal affection you are so good at."" I grin walking over to my baby boy taking him in my arms and slowly rocking him back and forth.

""Go ahead honey I'll be there to help you in a minute."" Nate calls out as I hum Shaun a lullaby as I walk him towards his room ready to lay him down.

""My boy isn't giving his mother any trouble is he?"" Nate questions as I look up at him happily.

""Oh I fixed that old mobile on his crib why don't you give it a spin."" Nate says taking Shaun from my arms allowing me to spin the small space ships that swung around over Shaun's crib.

I stare at the mobile as it plays a gentle tune making Shaun giggle at us. ""That’s my boy on his best behavior just like his dad..."" I raise an eye brow at Nate crossing my arms over my chest making him blush slightly.

""Well most of the time anyways…"" He added quietly rubbing his neck making me laugh.

""Uh hey Avery, I was thinking after break feast we could go out to the park for a walk, the weather should be holding up."" Nate coos at Shaun.

""Why don't we go get pumpkins and carve Jack-o-lanterns?"" I say my smile being forced off my face at the sound of Codsworth's screams.

""SIR, MUM YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO SEE THIS!!!!"" Nate and I stare at each other confused before we run out to the living room with Codsworth. Nate and I both turned to the TV.

""There were flashes…blinding flashes…sounds of explosions. We are trying to get confirmation, but we have lost contact with our affiliate stations. We do have confirming reports I repeat confirming reports of nuclear detonations in New York…Pennsylvania…. Oh…god!"" The news anchor said before the screen went blank.

""WE NEED TO GET TO THE VAULT NOW!"" I cried heading for the door.

""I have Shaun let's go!"" Nate called back as we ran out on to the street to see it in chaos. Families were screaming and soldiers were directing them to the Vault.

""Let's go Avery!"" Nate said running in front of me following the directions of the soldiers.

""Citizens if you are registered report to Vault 111 immediately."" The soldiers screamed as we ran past them through the woods as we got to the top of the hill behind sanctuary. We reached the gate to see the man who had given us our spot in the Vault arguing with the guards.

""Avery Moore were on the list."" I growled taking Nate's hand.

""One infant, one adult male one adult female. Go on in."" He said moving out of the way allowing us to pass.

""Go to the platform and stand in the middle!"" One of the soldiers called out as we ran to the giant Vault standing on a platform shaped like a giant gear.

""oh my god what's going to happen?!"" the others cried but I took a step closer looking out as the first bomb dropped.

""Everything is going to be okay… I love you."" Nate murmured hugging Shaun tightly as he walked up behind me taking my hand in his tightly. I stared in shock as it exploded. An array of dark red, orange and yellow sprang through all at once making the sky darken creating a giant mushroom cloud in its wake as we slowly began to descend into the Vault, then it hit me.

""BRACE YOURSELVES!"" I screamed turning to Nate pulling him into a crouch as I wrapped my arms around him covering Shaun. A large gust of wind ran over us causing everyone to scream and panic until we finally reached the inside of the vault.

""Everyone please step up the stairs in an orderly fashion. No need to worry Folks we will get everyone situated in their new homes. Vault 111 a better future underground!"" one man wearing a white lab coat called out. I took a deep breath letting go of Nates hand to step forward and walk up the stairs before the others.

I was ushered over to a woman holding a strange blue suit. She pulled me over to a changing room giving me some privacy as I took off my dress and pulled on the blue jumpsuit. ""Thanks. What now?"" I questioned in a hoarse voice.

""follow the doctor and he will take you to your new home."" a woman said staring at me strangely. I swallowed hard following behind the doctor as he lead us into a room with these strange machines. I looked at Nate and he pressed a gentle kiss to my lips before he climbed into the machine directly in front of mine.

""This machine will decontaminate and decompress you before we enter the lower parts of the vault."" The doctor said closing the hatches on both of our machines. Suddenly it started to get colder and colder and before long I was shivering staring at Nate and Shaun and before long everything went black."
