They dont realize how slippery the road is and push the vehicle to its limits without really noticing until the system can't do any more. Relying on this tech to sustain the summer speed limit thru mountain passes is causing accidents imo. People dont think they need to slow down because they ""feel"" in control. Where actually their stability and traction control is all thats keeping them in control. Tell they need brake or make a evasive maneuver.
On the other hand the computer probably saves a few lives because it can control a vehicle with a idiot behind the wheel. I personally dont like stability or traction control unless im towing in bad weather"
