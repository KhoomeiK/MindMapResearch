This makes you sound like someone who’s rude, not someone who’s confident. Stupid guide, that accomplishes basically nothing and would only hurt you.

If I told you that when you breathe air, you’re breathing in trillions and trillions of really really small invisible things in, and you asked me to prove it, I couldn’t because I wouldn’t have the utensils to do so. 

Try going back in time 1000 years ago and explaining germ theory, which we now know to be true. Just because you aren’t able to prove it exists, doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. It also doesn’t mean it does. Hence why it’s a bad faith argument to say that believing in the null hypothesis with certainty is somehow more intellectually justified than believing in the alternative hypothesis, if neither of you can prove your claim"

nextfuckinglevel,ffbwf6t,t1_ffbvp90,1579785002.0,"Yes it is, because the pendulum swings both ways.

Being unsure of whether s god like entity exists is reasonable. Being CERTAIN, that it doesn’t exist is just as stupid as being certain that it does.

Your analogy is stupid. Unicorns are a specific fantasy creature with no writing or mention behind them spanning over thousands of years from separate continents. It’s pretty unbelievable. Given the lack of knowledge we have about the universe, believing in a god like entity isn’t absurd.

People who are certain a mathematical conjecture  is correct are just as dumb as those who are certain it isn’t correct, if neither can prove or disprove it."
nextfuckinglevel,ffbw0hd,t1_ffbtttl,1579784629.0,You’re a fucking idiot if you think calling someone talented AND hard working downplays their achievement or effort.
nextfuckinglevel,ffbvvrp,t1_ffbs7nc,1579784506.0,"I’m a grad student. it’s very easy to recognise talent. Everyone works hard, no doubt about it. But when you see people think about problems or ideas that we all have equal footing on in terms of preparation, you can see their brain is better. If these types didn’t work hard, they’d probably be above average still. But If the average grad student didn’t work hard; they’d fail out. That’s the difference"
nextfuckinglevel,ffbvlir,t1_ffbojc2,1579784241.0,"You’re truly ignorant if you think hard work correlates perfectly with success. 

No one is discrediting her work ethic. But at some point you NEED talent in conjunction with hard work to achieve a high level of success. Hell, even that by itself won’t get you there.

NBA players be don’t magically happen to be 6’5 and also the hardest working athletes in their cohort.

Natural talent makes a huge difference. Someone with an IQ of 70 could sink 20,000 hours in a field of math, and I’ll find you a 10 year old prodigy who would trump him with less than 100 hours of practice, easily. 

Talent is necessary, and outside a world class level, talent is sufficient.

If you don’t think so, you haven’t met truly talented people. Their brains and bodies operate on a higher plane, just like disabled people operate on a lower plane.
