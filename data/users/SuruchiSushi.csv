Harry’s true self outweighed Voldemort’s darkness."

gaming,fdje72a,t1_fdjd9z7,1578467098.0,"I think it’s a good game, considering that’s it’s an indie game and still in development. It’s just that after playing Skate 3 for so long, with a more fleshed out world with NPCs and challenges, Sessions just felt a bit empty. 

If you’re looking for a pure skating sim to do tricks and such, it’s good. If you’re looking for something a bit more fleshed out, I would wait into its further in development."

MurderedByWords,fcvk2le,t1_fcvjjaj,1578003773.0,Yeah I think so. I just remember reading a comment on Reddit a while ago about hunting. I think they also had some point about deer population stabilizing due to hunting or something like that but I can’t remember what.
MurderedByWords,fcvijmb,t1_fcve0tm,1578002829.0,"I heard legal, licensed hunting is actually good for animal populations/conservation for multiple reasons. I’m not sure how true this is and it’s probably not just a black and white issue. 

I don’t hunt but I find nothing wrong with responsible approved hunting. Hey, we all have our opinions though."
oddlysatisfying,fcvfucw,t1_fcvdc3l,1578001211.0,I think the general consensus is that they used green ink and then used video editing to create a shimmering effect.

oddlysatisfying,fcvfc5c,t1_fcvcrrs,1578000910.0,I think she really only presses down on the part she wants to wrap and then peels away the rest. If you gently put a sticker on a surface it’s easy to peel away. If you press down on the sticker and let it set then it’s a lot harder.
oddlysatisfying,fcvepd6,t1_fcvblnc,1578000538.0,I don’t do wraps so this could be completely wrong but I just assumed they don’t cut all the way through. Just enough to tear it away nearly.
AskReddit,fcv79c6,t1_fcuup6m,1577996104.0,I bet most people just call about trash and debris on the highway and not body-like objects ahaha. Usually I wouldn’t bat an eye at a trash bag but it was just that weird thing sticking out.

AskReddit,fcudqas,t1_fctmv83,1577978549.0,I thought I saw a dead body on the side of an entrance ramp of a highway once. It was a long trash bag with what looked like a foot sticking out of it. I passed by it again the next day but slowed down to get a better look. I think it was just some flesh colored foam or something sticking out but it freaked me out at first.
ApplyingToCollege,fct857o,t1_fct7wzr,1577935408.0,I think you're just gonna have to try again and again. My application was being a bit faulty on Firefox so maybe try switching browsers if you're using that? I switched to Edge and it worked after a few tries.

And I guess you’re right it’s not a hyperbole. It’s just that you see so many comments saying “wow that person should get punched in the face” on the internet all the time but no one is actually going to do that. I feel like it’s more of an expression of disgust rather than an actual threat, y’know? But I see your point, not everything should lead to physical attacks."
quityourbullshit,fc3rlw4,t1_fc3pppw,1577396867.0,"I don’t think they meant literally throw a drink in their face, it’s just a hyperbole. But for your beard and hairstyle thing, I think a better analogy would be if you put a lot effort and time on your hairstyle every morning, spent lots of money on hair gels and mousse and cologne. Built up your hair styling skills through months of practice and awkward hair phases. All that for some snarky girl to say you would look so much better without it."
