space,few6oh6,t3_eqqt72,1579406065.0,"A big blob of gas and dust collapsed due to gravity. This blob of gas and dust has some small random average rotation. As it collapsed, the gas and dust started colliding more. Much of the gas and dust isn't orbiting exactly the same direction as the average rotation, so that gas and dust gets knocked by collisions towards the average rotation, or knocked towards the center. Eventually most of the gas and dust collapsed in the center, forming the sun.

Gas and dust that is roughly orbiting with the rotation of the entire blob will tend to have fewer collisions. So that gas and dust can remain in a stable orbit, forming a thin disk of material all orbiting in roughly the same direction. 

It's the same principle for spiral galaxies. Spiral galaxies started out as giant blobs of gas and dust, and eventually collapsed into a disk. Stars then formed in that disk of gas and dust.

Stars and dark matter don't collide as much as gas and dust, so stars and dark matter don't collapse into disks. That's why globular clusters, elliptical galaxies, and dark matter halos are all not flat."

> Cosmic dust clouds and young, energetic stars inhabit this telescopic vista, less than 500 light-years away toward the northern boundary of Corona Australis, the Southern Crown. The dust clouds effectively block light from more distant background stars in the Milky Way. But the striking complex of reflection nebulae cataloged as NGC 6726, 6727, and IC 4812 produce a characteristic blue color as light from the region's young hot stars is reflected by the cosmic dust. The dust also obscures from view stars still in the process of formation. At the left, smaller yellowish nebula NGC 6729 bends around young variable star R Coronae Australis. Just below it, glowing arcs and loops shocked by outflows from embedded newborn stars are identified as Herbig-Haro objects. On the sky this field of view spans about 1 degree. That corresponds to almost 9 light-years at the estimated distance of the nearby star forming region."
