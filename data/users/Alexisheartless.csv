datingoverthirty,ffpqzgr,t3_eudf04,1580102620.0,"Yeah,  I searched and found his dating profile and he was telling me all the while he still loved me and thought about me too much to date. I finally got my validation and know I've made the right decision.
It's going to be another long night.  It still hurts.. but I can get over it. I've gotten through worse."
datingoverthirty,ffmikfy,t1_ffmhoea,1580055244.0,"I'm sorry, I misread your comment about unworthy women who feels they need to love to feel purposeful and thought you were a guy referring to other women.  My other comments about being pessimistic is just my opinion and was just in general relating to the mindset and not making assumptions about you. I'm sorry if you took it personally."
datingoverthirty,ffmdgqe,t3_eu59lp,1580052900.0,"I wonder if this is too pessimistic. All relationships take hard work after the novelty and honeymoon phase wears off. If you have the mindset that life is short, might as well just have fun and date for pleasure, you can find people who have the same mindset,  but please be honest with those who are looking for something different,  like the women you said are ""unworthy because they need to love someone to feel they have a purpose"". It's good you broke it off and realized you wanted different things.  There's nothing wrong with either mindsets though.
 I for one,  feel like there's a deeper connection and stronger bond when two people go through the hardships and difficulties in life together and support each other.  Going from one relationship to the next without ever opening yourself up to vulnerability will not give that opportunity to build that kind of relationship. This is what I want and I'm hoping to find someone who will want the same and think I'm worthy of the effort to be vulnerable. 
It takes someone very emotionally strong to be capable of being vulnerable again after being burned very badly though and that's rare to find nowadays it seems."
