It's the new year and all that, time for new beginnings!
And hold off and telling her about the dream for a while though....
There's no such thing as the right moment, just text her that you like her off you're to nervous, or get her flowers or a gift and tell her, if you really wanna make it romantic"

>At this point it had been months of tension building from a toxic relationship Aey and I contributed to.

From what you've described, you do come across as apathetic but I do understand that sometimes, one has had enough, having said that, if you do feel as though the relationship is getting toxic or that the atmosphere was getting toxic, instead of running away you should've talked it out, I get that you're 16 here, but running away and creating an ruse to do isn't the best idea.

I hope you've managed to find time to sit down and talk it out with your friends"

Quotes from the article:
""Despite struggling with some of the world's worst air pollution levels, India has already pushed back a deadline to cut emission levels to up to 2022, after extensive lobbying by power producers who cited high costs and technical difficulties.

India are already set to miss a phased deadline starting Dec. 2019 to cut¬†emissions of lung diseases-causing sulphur oxides.

Thermal power¬†companies¬†produce three-quarters of the country's electricity and account for some 80 per cent of India's industrial emissions of sulphur oxides that cause lung diseases and smog-creating nitrogen oxides.""

This is literally the worst climate crisis the country has ever faced. And yet, this all seems to be taking a backseat to all the political hullabaloos happening around us.

I sincerely hope, that anyone that reads this post realises that now is the time we have to act."
