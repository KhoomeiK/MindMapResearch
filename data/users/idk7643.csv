My advice: talk to your sister. She and you need to convince your mum to take all of the money from joint bank accounts, to put it on a new account or one your dad has no access to (this is entirely legal!). Otherwise there's a chance your dad will do it to start a new life with the new woman and he might take it. 
Then go straight to a lawyer with your mum, he can ensure that all of your mums rights are being met. The moment your parents seperate your mum might be entitled to monthly payments from your dad until a divorce happens depending on how financially secure she is compared to him. Just straight up take everything that's worth money and put it somewhere safe. 
Your mum will be in a very bad place emotionally for a few months and won't be able to do all of the necessary arrangements to ensure that you, her and your sister are financially secure if your dad decides to be even more of a dick. He doesn't give a fuck about your mum anymore so the onpy thing that's keeping him from taking everything he can rn is you because you still live with your mum.

My advice is:
1. Stay friendly and talkative. Ask people questions, people like talking about themselves. Introduce yourself to someone by making up reasons to ask them questions, e.g. ask about classes, teachers, the area (""I'm new here, where do you think I can get XYZ?"") etc.
2. Buy gum. At least in my school people loved to get gum from anybody. Although they will obviously at first only want the gum, it means people notice you and are likely to associate you with something positive. Just offer it to someone (make it obvious that you're eating one, then be like ""hey, you also want one?"". Can also be used as a conversation starter)
3. Be confident and try not to be nervous when talking to people. Talk to new people as if they were already your friends. People will only tell you to ""fuck off"" if you seem weird, and you only seem weird if you act super nervous and like you're desperate and lonely . Instead, act as if you already got friends.
4. Stay on it! Once you started talking to someone, come back. It will take weeks to establish a friendship. The important part is to not give up and talk to people every single day. Especially at the beginning, spend every free minute you have socialising. Talk to as many people as you can. If people see you talking to people, they will instantly assume that you're a desirable friend and will want to hang out with you.
5. Take initiative. Make efforts to spend time with people, but always make it look like you're not actually putting effort in. E.g. if you hear that a group is going to a mall and you already talked with them a few times, be like:
""oh, which mall are you all going to?""
-"" the star mall""
""cool. What time will you be there? I wanted to go there anyways to buy X so I might as well join you. Would you mind if I come along?""

Plus we are on r/haircarescience so I'm talking about any supplements that are sold under the pretense that it is supposed to help hair growth. Nobody takes iron supplements for hair growth, also taking iron supplements without a deficiency can be dangerous"
HaircareScience,ff6gvlr,t1_ff6em42,1579626927.0,"Yes, it harms your wallet. If you want more protein in your diet, eat more meat or beans. Our body isn't made to absorb a weeks worth of anything in a tablet, collagen as well as most other substitute tablets are a marketing scam. Unless you have a truly horrible diet, it is (apart from iron deficiency anemia) almost impossible nowadays to have a nutritional deficiency. And unless you have one, taking any tablets is a waste of money. And even then, eating healthy would be more effective than the tablets."

More natural products don't do anything, that's just part of the anti science crusade that has been going on now for a while. Natural isn't better in any way. Haircare products are designed to work, and if you're already using professional products that's as good as it gets, no ""natural"" product will beat that. If natural products helped saloons would slap (much cheaper) coconut oil on you and not conditioner."

BDSMAdvice,felxebb,t3_epsx23,1579233348.0,"You could try to dominate him instead until he snaps. Like essentially if there is anything dominant inside of him you can get it out by teasing him until he really wants to cum but not allowing him to, and to be really mean about it. Say things like ""you want to cum? I think you're gonna have to take it from me"" etc.

But if he doesn't fight back then he's just a sub.
I used to date a sub for 2,5 years and after breaking up I had my first proper dom. My sex life got 100 times better over night.
I do believe a good amount of people are naturally dom, subs or switches."
HaircareScience,felk6w6,t1_felj5f8,1579224144.0,"For the free fix ask for a permanent ash brown colour. Semi/demi permanent will just wash out again.
That way it will stay relatively ashy for long enough that you can wait to grow out your hair until its healthy again.
You got to wait with the colour remover and then bleaching the orange out until enough hair has grown back that you can have a hair cut and say that your hair is pretty healthy. The bleaching will definitely damage it so you got to wait for any dry ends to be cut off."
HaircareScience,feli9m8,t1_fel71th,1579222816.0,"What products do you use?

Professional conditioners (buy from amazon, e.g. Redken or L'Oréal professionals) aren't diluted like drug store ones and usally do more.

Also, how long is your hair?"
HaircareScience,felhflx,t3_epq5s9,1579222246.0,"Pictures would really help here.

Do you absolutely want blonde? Because what you could do is, put on another darker permanent colour such as brown, wait until your hair is pretty healthy, then use a colour remover (e.g. by B4) once or twice to get rid of all artificial pigment. Colour remover removes artificial pigment without damaging your hair. Once you do that, it will be a ""blank"" canvas with only the lightened parts, the orange and the grey hairs but no dark pigments left except your natural re-growth. Then the orange parts can be bleached until its a pale yellow. From there, an ashy blonde can be put on top.

Also: next time at a hairdresser, ask them to do a test strand first."

No matter how well you take care of it, you got to trim off the ends all 6 months. Once a split end happens, you can only ttim it off nothing will fix it.

self,feibm7p,t1_fehmxft,1579134703.0,"I'm not qualified to do accounting or programming. I'd have to do a degree in accounting or programming for that, because without a degree there's no way you know enough about it to properly do a job correctly, unless you find a company that is in such a desperate state for employees that they are willing to teach you for a year.
Also, since research is a shitshow I'm going into the industry.
And its not just my area, it is all areas that require any amount of specialised skill.
You can't go into engineering without having studied engineering because how on earth will you know how to do anything? You also can't go into law without having studied law, because there's a reason they teach you about laws."

self,feiawwi,t1_fehnif5,1579134233.0,"Do you live in the USA?
Because in Europe there's no way you'll get any job just by having any degree.
Like even if you want to sell bread in a bakery, they won't employ you if you have a PhD in physics because the REQUIREMENT is to have a successful apprenticeship in sales management or something very closely related.
If you Spanish is your native and you have a masters in Spanish literature, you can't become a Spanish teacher. You need to study teaching&spanish at university.
If you want to work in criminal law, you need to study law and then specialise in criminal law. Because a divorce lawyer has no idea about criminal law and wouldn't be able to do the job correctly.

You also wouldn't employ an IT guy to fix cars, because programming isn't the same as knowing how to exchange breaks and whatnot."
HaircareScience,fei69qs,t3_ep9dt5,1579131216.0,"Probably slightly less damaging just because it's on a lower heat, but I'd recommend to get a straight perm done. I mean you could actually even do it yourself as long as your hair is straight when it's wet. Meanwhile perms do cause hair damage, you wouldn't have to apply that much heat every time you wash it.
Otherwise, try to buy a professional conditioner (on amazon, search for redken, L'Oréal professionals, schwarzkopf professionals etc.) that is meant for damaged hair.
Drug store conditioners/serums are always diluted, only professional conditioners can really give you the maximum amount of product deposit. Essentially the more conditioner you have in there, the more likely it will weigh it down and help to keep it less curly. Essentially just go nuts with protein treatments and silicones, as those things will stick."
BdsmDIY,fehvlll,t3_ep7god,1579124748.0,"I'd suggest to construct a simple free standing suspension using metal angels and wooden beams. You'd be able to construct it pretty easily and cheap.

You could even put a small storage thing under it as well, or one of those things that are constructed to have shoes on them.

Also paint it a colour, like blue or something. It's only an obvious BDSM suspension if you make it look like it. If you avoid big bolts and leather you should be fine"

And once I have that, I'm unable to have an actual career unless I complete a PhD program.

Think about that. A minimum of 7 years at uni plus 1 year work experience just to have a proper job. And thats biomedicine, something every hospital needs and every pharmaceutical company.

I know people who had to work 3 years in a supermarket sorting shelves because they couldn't get into a PhD program and without a PhD most science degrees are pretty useless.

I think OP lives in the UK and there marine life practically doesn't exist outside of zoos. 
Also even if you do happen to live in a country/ place with lots of marine life and a government that is willing to fund it, you will always work in research. Research has extremely unstable jobs as you only get a grand for the duration of your research, afterwards you have to find someone new who is willing to give you money. So it's a struggle to get a new grand all 2-4 years.

Also I think you mistake Criminology for Forensics. In Forensics they indeed teach you some basics in biochemistry that you could theoretically use to change your career and get into the industry somewhere if you're lucky, but criminology is legit just like sociology but for criminals.
For example, a popular course is criminology & psychology as the two subjects overlap a lot.

Now, how many people does a criminal law enforcement department need that spend their time analysing the psychological behaviour of criminals?"
