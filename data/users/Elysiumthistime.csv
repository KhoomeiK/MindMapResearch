Dogtraining,ff93gl2,t1_ff8yaql,1579703917.0,100% agree. I had a similar issue when introducing my 1.5 year old mixed breed (collie mix) with my boyfriends 3 year old Bordeaux. My dog kept attacking her randomly. They're fine together now but my dog was still young so her behaviour wasn't engrained in her yet
Dogtraining,ff92fgr,t3_esbp9y,1579703183.0,"This doesn't sound like a problem. The only area I can see potentially trouble is your new dog bonding more with the resident dog.

Dogtraining,ff8xria,t1_ff8xgww,1579699513.0,"Ya I guess in that regard they would be harder to train but those dogs you mentioned would also require a lot more exercise so it depends on what you're after. . I own a collie mix and she's was extremely easy to train but I struggle to keep up with her smart brain which never turns off. At least with the Bordeauxs, they have an off button.

She did fantastic on the journey home which included a total of 6 hours driving and four hours on a ferry with very little complaints. She then met with some of her new family members. Holly, a 12 year old retriever had very little interest in her and Hooch, a 5 year old Bordeaux liked her a little too much so they will not be left unsupervised. We haven't introduced the two other females yet as if any will cause issues it would be them.

She slept in her crate beside our room and she settled after a short time, only waking again at 3am and 7am. We haven't tried any training yet but I'm eager to get started."
Dogtraining,ff8r24q,t3_esad87,1579692605.0,"All dogs bar the handful of hypoallergenic dogs (bichon frise for example) will shed fur. To minimise how much gets dumped in your house you'll need to brush them daily and more often during shedding season.

With that said, can I suggest you consider a Dogue de Bordeaux? They're a big breed but very loyal, extremely laid back, easy to train and they don't require an excessive amount of exercise or attention (they are quite content left alone during the day if you work). The negatives are they have a short life expectancy (6-8 years on average) and can be big on the drool (varies from individual to individual, all droll but some more than others)"
Dogtraining,ff8qfm3,t3_es90df,1579691765.0,"A tip for teaching drop it with toys is to get two he loves and put one in your pocket. Play with the other toy, toss it to him and then after he's picked it up, take the second toy out of your pocket and get him interested in it. Don't ask for a drop it but act like you're about to throw it but just wait until he naturally drops the first toy. As he drops it, say drop it. Repeat, repeat, repeat!

Also, I'd advise teaching two commands for this. Drop it AND leave it. That way you can ask them to leave it but if they pick it up you can resort to drop it. They are two very different actions so I really would advise teaching both.

The most difficult hurdle is actually getting them to want to drop it. My girl knows exactly what drop it means but sometimes playing fetch she just doesn't wanna give the ball back. If I get her frisbee out though, I barely get to say ""drop"" and she's spitting the ball out so having something you can trade with as a last resort is helpful"

I'd even recommend only taking them to do their business on grass because honestly, it's so much easier to pick up poop off the grass and also it means they're less likely to poop on the footpath (even if you pick it up, you never get it all and someone is bound to step on it and carry it into their home ü§Æ)"
dogs,ff6csg1,t1_ff618af,1579624382.0,"My friend staffy does the same thing, they just take the bowl up and down so she can't overdo it but I'll suggest that idea to them, at least the dog can have 24hr access then"
Dogtraining,ff6cl2b,t3_erw39w,1579624252.0,"I just used wait and release is the release word. My girl won't wait if my boyfriend throws the ball through, he has a far better throw than me and it's still too tempting but I did find doing this helped with her impulse control and now if I catch on early enough that she's caught a scent when we are on off leash walks, it's so much easier to snap her out of her fixation and 9 times out of 10 I can get her to sit and wait for me to come stick a lead on her until we've passed the scent/squirrel. 

So I guess what I'm saying is, don't stress too much on what command you use, it's the act of waiting dispite really wanting to chase that ball that builds up their impulse control and you won't be using those commands if they do catch a scent or spot a small critter. If you really wanted to teach say a leave it command, I'd recommend using a flirt pole (DIY style will do fine) and teach a full blown leave it/ignore command"
Dogtraining,ff5wecg,t3_erudyr,1579612496.0,"I've no experience training deaf pups but I'd imagine deciding on clear and unique hand signals before you begin training would be a wise, preparing what you want to teach before you start and having a training plan in place with goals and difficulties tracked. I'd also advise keeping a small note book to track your training and take note of anything you've learnt and discovered during a training session.

The biggest issue I see if getting their attention, especially if they're far away. 
I know that some people vehemently dispise ecollars (not shock collars, the ones that only vibrate) but I think one might be useful here, simply used to get the dogs attention (turn it to the lowest setting), almost like it's the come command. They can't hear so you have two sences left to work with to get their attention (because smell would be very hard to tap into for this purpose); sight and touch.

Dogtraining,fegvu5d,t3_ep3kuh,1579103676.0,"What I did was put a treat on the other side of the muzzle so she had to stick her face into the muzzle to get it. After a while of doing that, I started just producing the muzzle as I had been but without the treat. I then waited until she put her face into the muzzle before producing the treat. At this stage, I was feeding while she still had her face in the muzzle but later I fed by taking the muzzle away and feeding her the treat normally. I then gradually increased the time I needed her to wait with her face in the muzzle before producing the treat. If she took her face out early, I would just stand up, walk a few steps away and if she followed, continued on (if she didn't I give her a break before trying again) but slightly reducing the time before I treated to maintain her engagement. Then I started simply fastening the muzzle and immediately removing it again. I would do this frequently for a few days, simply putting the muzzle on and taking it off immediately, followed by treats if she didn't put up a fuss. After that I just increased the time, starting with 10 seconds, then 15 seconds etc. Increase in whatever increments your dog is able for.

Being able to stop while going at speed is important too. Crossovers are so fun, I'd recommend learning them just because, though, something I noticed coming from inlines is crossovers are harder on quads because they're a wider base and it's easier to trip yourself up off the outside wheels of your crossing over foot.

Alongside backwards skating, building up your balance on one foot, being able to turn around (transition from forwards to backwards skating) and jumping (start small and work up to more advanced jumps) I think would be the most beneficial skills to start working on next"

 I'd highly recommend alternatives to traditional exercise too such as scent games with food or games like hide and seek in your house. Also, lure training where you guide them using food to walk under your legs, to walk backwards, in a wide circle etc. (kinda doing the basics of heel work to music but you're not giving commands etc. so it's more fun than regular obedience training). Tug of war can also be good, burns loads of energy and food puzzles such as a stuffed kong all adds to their overall daily mental stimulation and that tires a young pup out as much as physical exercise! :)"

3) It's extremely malleable so can be moulded easily into different shapes
4) It can easily be mixed with other 
 metals such as palladium to form a stronger alloy"
Dogtraining,fdp07m4,t3_emgzhg,1578616903.0,"This episode of ""It's me or the dog"" might have some useful advice for you, if the link doesn't work it's the episode with the dog Manny and he refuses to allow the womans husband to come near her on the couch or in bed. There's definitely another episode with a younger couple having similar issues, if I can remember which one it is I'll post that link

relationship_advice,fdjte6u,t3_elj0e9,1578486835.0,"I had a friend who was an absolute nightmare behind a wheel. She drove me to a mutual friends birthday party and lied to me that we were late and missing the cake to excuse her speeding. At one point the car ahead put on their indicator and was clearly breaking but rather than slow down she sped up towards them, slammed on the brakes last second and cursed the other car out. When we got to the party we were the second people to arrive, I could have killed her. O turned to her and told her I'd never be setting foot in her car again and to this day I haven't. Granted, we fell out a year later because she treats people like dirt to be honest and I was fed up. Last I heard she lost her licence after racking up penalty points. On one occasion she was caught red handed taking selfies in traffic, the police were in traffic right next to her, she's so dumb üòÇ

My point is, if you don't feel safe in the car, tell him this is not up for debate and you're not getting in his car again until he shows he's capable of driving safely"
