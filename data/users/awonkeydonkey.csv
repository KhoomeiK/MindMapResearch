ketorecipes,ffjmgp2,t1_ffjetux,1580001641.0,I just make so much shit including my cats raw food that these are cheap and easy to buy
poshmark,ffjbiy2,t3_etych3,1579994833.0,I use Layout and love it. It’s so easy
ketorecipes,ffjar51,t3_etyd1c,1579994384.0,I normally buy mine but these sound amazing.
poshmark,ffiz0co,t1_ffiru9d,1579986212.0,It’s just hard when it is everything from Xs to 3x  to think this is the case
poshmark,ffipgap,t1_ffip9wa,1579979453.0,Well I did start a bundle and made a comment letting her know I was available for any questions. That’s when the likes stopped. So I have no idea what is happening.
poshmark,ffioq26,t1_ffinpx6,1579978946.0,She is a buyer only so I guess is there something I am missing?
poshmark,ffion9z,t1_ffingn6,1579978893.0,"Lol you are right. My mind was to boggled on the situation And worlds worst speller.  

It matters since I would like to know if there is a Benefit for them or I that I am missing when it comes to likes."
poshmark,ffin7ga,t1_ffimr2r,1579977911.0,"I don’t know I started a bundle and commented if she need and help or had a questions please make sure to ask and bammm she stopped.

Edit to say she is just a buyer but has been around for a couple years and has several purchases."
CrackheadCraigslist,ffik5bt,t1_ffh8i6j,1579975800.0,YUP LOL
poshmark,fffn3wc,t1_ffffgx0,1579887522.0,Lmao
Flipping,fffga2f,t1_ffffhks,1579883314.0,"LOL  ok your right I would not have but mainly cause I am not into kate spade. BUT people put things up all the time for super cheap prices and sell them.  You are really creating your own problem listing it like that. I am shocked she put it in a bundle at all and did not just out right purchase it.  It may seem like its easy to understand what your intent was but for non sellers or new users not so much

For instance I bought a DVF dress, that sells for 100 all day long on posh (I know cause I have been looking for it for a while) for $12.  It was in perfect condition."
Flipping,fffeobk,t3_etcegj,1579882315.0,Instead of listing it $5. List it at $9999.  If I say it at $5 I might have tried it to.
cats,fff6bkd,t3_etalef,1579876821.0,You might still be having small aftershocks that you can’t feel but kitty can.
cats,fff3lsl,t3_etasqt,1579874796.0,Yup. Time to give in and let that kitty come inside
cats,ffdyarb,t3_et38o9,1579831945.0,A strange meow is a tall tell sign for her being in heat. If she is around 6 months.  I would get her to a vet for a neuter as soon as you can.  Even though she is inside and there are no other cats that you know of near by a female in heat will bring them out a tomcat quick.
cats,ffdwobt,t3_et38o9,1579830785.0,Is she laying down and sticking her booty in the air?  How old is she?  Is she rubbing on you more then normally?  If these are true and she is approximately 6 months old she is in heat. She does not need another cat to be around to go into heat. Kitten season is spring but they bread year around.
poshmark,ffch3mq,t3_esvzj1,1579799326.0,You can sell anything you would like condition wise (except undies). If someone is willing to buy it and you honest about condition through pictures and description.
poshmark,ffa8flr,t3_esiknt,1579729907.0,"Lol.  I have had this happen, so annoying but what are you going to do."
Mercari,ff8xlbr,t1_f02k4q0,1579699365.0,I use the insulated bags from Whole Foods delivery as bubble wrap in packages.  I felt so guilty just tossing them in the garbage after one use.  Thankfully they have stopped using them in our store so it’s just paper bags I use as wadded up as box filler.
poshmark,ff85swl,t3_es6m5m,1579666791.0,That’s all you need to do.  You don’t have to have the box say priority since the label will say it.  Stickers are nice but not necessary
cats,ff85gkk,t3_es6n8v,1579666514.0,Lol. I used to do that with my first cat.  She would stand on my hand as I would raise her up and we would balance her so she could get the bug.
poshmark,ff56cqp,t1_ff557a0,1579581498.0,Posh would never admit it but I also don’t think it is part of the algorithm.  I think it’s mostly just ups and downs.   I have had a few less then 5 star review and have not noticed this happen unless I am personally frustrated and I take a little time off of posh and my sales stop.
ketorecipes,ff3zhe9,t3_erj227,1579552242.0,Grind it and add it to pork (which is to lean) for sausage.
BehindTheClosetDoor,ff0r8ez,t3_er1tc7,1579471544.0,"All the time, and randomly.  i have gone as far to delete and repost the item and still wont show up.  I think poshmark hates me(crying in the corner)"
