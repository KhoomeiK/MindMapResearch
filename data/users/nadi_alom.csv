study,fcmr2y3,t3_ehzl11,1577788039.0,Thats completely normal and more than enough. I heard that when you're studying your brain best focuses in 30 minute chunks so its better to break down studying in that time than do a whole day of studying.
bulletjournal,fclost8,t1_fclonov,1577752836.0,The show is super inspiring and thank you. I hope your 2020 is also filled with shots to take. ðŸ˜Š
