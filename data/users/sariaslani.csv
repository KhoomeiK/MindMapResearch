On this link you can find the latest software for your TV, I believe, 1st you have download to your computer and than unzip the file to USB, connect the USB to tv and do the rest. the easiest way is go to general on your tv setting and about this TV, and check for update, if is not pick up the latest software just try discconevt your wifi or cable from internet and rest your modem and try again.
