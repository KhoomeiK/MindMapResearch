SRAWeekend,ffd4f0o,t1_f7bh52q,1579813209.0,"Don't know anything about property values, but we did it at my bosses place when a house across the street was for sale. His property was backed up to woods so we weren't shooting towards houses or anything. Whenever the realtor would show the house we'd take a break from work, (splitting firewood) and go shooting. After a few times of us doing this the realtor came and talked to us and asked us to quit, but my boss just told him he wanted people to know what kind of area they're moving to. Eventually a fellow gun guy moved in and he was stoked to have us as neighbors, and would come over and shoot with us a couple times a week."

When I'm watching my niece and nephew and have to go to the store our first stop is produce for blueberries so the kids have something to snack on and keep them busy while I'm shopping. It makes the whole operation go a lot smoother. I carry cash so I know for certain I'll be able to pay, but your husband was on his way back with the card so I really don't see what the big deal is.

And I always have weed on me, often in the glovie next to the gun. I tell cops about the gun when they ask if i have anything they should know about and they don't even ask about drugs. It probably helps that I'm white and fairly country. If I was black I'm sure I'd have been shot by the cops ten times by now. I wouldn't worry about a pocket knife, and I wouldn't worry about tiny amounts of drugs either. A gram of coke? A few tabs of acid? Fucking eat that shit. The cop will be gone before you come up. My legal advice is to chill the fuck out and you'll probably be fine, but I am clearly not an attorney."
