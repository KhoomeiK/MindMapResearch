Furthermore, the meaning of ""woman"" , ""man"", ""male"", and ""female"" are all based on their usage in the language game.

QuantumComputing,fe2hhev,t3_ennkeb,1578838407.0,"The ""chips"" are superconducting circuits.  Most common metals form superconductors at low temperature.  A superconductor has effectively no resistance (no friction) - it is a purely quantum mechanical effect.  So some quantum computing chips are based on tiny metal circuits that when cooled to low temperature have superconducting currents that behave like quantum particles.

Another leading platform for quantum computing is trapped ions, where actual molecules with a positive charge are trapped in  place by a voltage and their quantum mechanical states are manipulated by lasers."
