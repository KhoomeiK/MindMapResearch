Just want to point out that this is not exactly accurate. The water level of Lake Ontario is primarily set by the amount of water allowed out of the St. Lawrence river. The problem is that if more water were to be released to alleviate the issues in the GTA, there would be significantly more flooding occuring all along the St. Lawrence in Quebec.

But more importantly, the NBA could easily be upselling advertisers by using more targeted ads that are possible through streaming.

oculus,fehpz3n,t3_ep43wr,1579121553.0,"So the key trick is to still leave enough slack in the system that you barely even need to use the pulley. I have the cable hanging down to around the mid back and it works perfectly.

Unless I'm right at the very edge of my playable area it doesn't need to engage the pulley at all. Once the pulley does start doing it's thing, it's an indication for me that I am getting within a foot of the boundary.

I can move freely, never worry about the cable getting in my feet, and can reach all parts of my play area even if crouched on the ground. The only small issue is that for certain games (bow and arrow ones in particular), you'll need to start in the correct spot to keep the wire away from where you're ""drawing arrows"".

The way I think of the system is that it's purpose is to keep me from ever noticing the wire. Any kind of retraction that would keep things tight is going to be noticable. The goal is to set the system so that most of the work is being accomplished simply by the ceiling hanging approach, and the purpose of the pulleys is to provide a fail safe way that if you move a little too far it won't break anything.

Think of it like a vacuum cord that is constantly retracting. It would be annoying as hell to always be pulling against a retracting cord. So instead they put a stop in, you pull out the amount that you expect to need and move freely around. But if you pull the vacuum too far you'll know it immediately but won't pull the cord out of it by mistake."
