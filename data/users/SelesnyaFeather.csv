Also what happened to the ""you break it. You buy it"" saying because that would hardcore apply to this situation."

Bozeman,fehgf9e,t3_ep6flx,1579116011.0,"I grew up here so let me give you a small list.

-running red lights and/or stop signs. Also not paying attention to the above at 2 way intersections.

-Not picking up their dog poop ever. Not even in dog parks or trails ffs. 

-on the topic of dogs, people having their dogs off leash in leashed areas drives me fucking nuts. Especially in city limits. I dont care how well your dog is trained it's still an animal and has little to no regard to it's own safety as far as streets and cars go. Ig another dog or a squirrel or something catches its eye across the street and it ignores your come command your dog will get hit because people dont pay attention when they drive.

-everyone always being in a goddamn hurry. Seriously life isnt going anywhere unless someone is dead or dying in or on your way to the hospital.

-wanting trader Joe's/whole foods/winco/hobby lobby to open and not shutting up about it. Also asking for said organic food stores and totally ignoring the fact we have the co-op, TnC, and Rosaurs which carry the same if not similar things.

-the entire town is obsessed with skiing and shames those of us who dont care about it. Theres more to life than going up a mountain then coming back down again (and yes, I have skied before many times).

-people moving here, and thus making rent and cost of living absolutely absurd, AND THEN complaining that it costs to much to live here. Christ maybe do your research next time. 

-saying that certain intersections need a light for safety, and the city either doing nothing or putting a roundabout in. There is no in between and no compromise.

I'm sure I could come up with more but those are the ones off the top of my head."

I cant make a judgement here because it's a hard topic, but I do reccomend talking to SIL about it and being clear and honest.
Tell her that nieces currently beliefs would hurt her father, and that she should know before continuing down this path. Give the chance to SIL to tell her herself, but she should definitely know before she graduates and gets sucked into these ideals.

Pulling tuition may not be the best move here, but pulling some might not be bad. She can still go, but will need to get a job to pay for some of it."

AskVet,fdjfdbu,t3_elmkb8,1578468441.0,"VA in training here, and I would take this to r/legaladvice and see what they say. They can direct you to laws that might give you some ground to stand on should you decide to go after the clinic legally.

Like others have said, this isnt an oopsie. This is a major elective surgery. At the clinics I have worked at, every surgery has it's own paperwork, and anything extra like a nail trim is added by the tech or assistant, not the client. I would also seek a cat specialized clinic or another clinic in general and drop this one it's hot.

I wish your mother the best of luck, and I'm sorry for this horrible situation."
relationship_advice,fdadtv4,t3_ek8wyo,1578244962.0,"Oh my God.
Run.

This is so incredibly abusive and you need to get out now. Any person that does this is a horrible human being that you dont need to be around. Other users have elaborated on exactly why.

Honestly? It sounds like you live with him so I would slowly start packing things to get out. I would also change your time to take the pill when he isnt around, or talk to your doctor about getting on something like the shot or implant, which is long term and ""invisible"". I've heard many stories of people in relationships like yours who can't get out and change their birth control so their partner can't interfere.

And the sex he held you down for sounds very much like or at least similar to rape. If you didnt previously consent to being held down like that and didnt consent to him going inside you with no protection.....well...."

Otherwise they can fuck right off."

Do what others have said; burrito and then put the cone on. From there put her in a carrier / crate and wait for her to calm down. Eventually she will get that the cone isnt there to hurt her and that she will in fact be ok."
Bozeman,fcszs9k,t3_eiqol1,1577929207.0,"Cottonwood vet is who I go to. Super nice and knowledgeable staff. They make sure everything is clear and up front with you, especially when it comes to surgeries. I've worked in the vet field and find their prices to be on the lower end of what's offered in the valley.

My fiances family has been going there for over 30 years and have never had a single issue. They've worked with his family on everything from Guinea pigs to horses, even if it's just advice.  Apparently the way they handle euthanasias (which is hard for the vet and owner) is amazing as well, so that's always a bonus to me when I'm considering a vet."
childfree,fcsskfw,t3_eikz3u,1577924039.0,"Get the dog anyway IMO. Just to show her you can take care of it, and do it to the best of your ability.
And later when she says ""where are my grandbabies?"" Just say ""oh (dogs name) is our baby, and were planning on getting another later."" 
And watch her implode because you're not a breeder."
dogs,fcn0spj,t1_fckjleb,1577799940.0,"I must be an exception reading all of these replies.

My dog is an anxious mess and was dog-reactive when we first got her. In fact my friends still give me shit that I got my dog to help my anxiety and she has anxiety.

However, we (my fiance and i) really worked on socializing her (and are still working on it) and working through her anxiety. I've learned ways to control my anxiety because I know it projects and if I escalate she does to, and that can cause fights in the wrong situation.
I can now take her to the park and - for the most part - not worry about her getting in fights with other dogs (shes actually started to play with other dogs and it makes me so proud considering where she was when we first got her). I know her tells when she has anxiety and were learning how to deal with those. 

If you can handle and have the experience to deal with a reactive dog then by all means if it's a good fit. It is draining and a lot of work but so rewarding at the end."
dogs,fcn04sg,t3_eho07v,1577799321.0,"For context, my pets are Holly (6ish year old GSD/x) and Corvo (1 year old cat).

When my now-fiance and I adopted Holly, we were moving away from our hometown for the first time ever. We knew the move would be hard on us, and we both have depression to different degrees, along with a various assortment of other mental health issues.

I cannot even begin to describe how much she helps both of us. We got very very lucky to have a snuggly dog who can be both a couch potato and be super active. Perfect fit for our lifestyle. She tends to know when we have depression episodes and motivates us to get outside, which puts us in a better mood than just staying inside would. Hell she will even come get you when she needs to go out because she knows we can forget. 

She doesn't come to us when we need emotional support though, but Corvo does that just fine. It's not her personality. She will come sit in the same room as you though, and sometimes that's just enough.

We've since moved back to our hometown, and are as happy as we can be with our living situation (student loans, bills, never enough money....just regular adult things) and we contribute a lot of that happiness to both pets.

TL;DR my fiance and I both have depression and our dog is the best thing that has happened to us. Just make sure if you get one that it's a good fit for you and your lifestyle."
childfree,fcmxibg,t1_fcma3vy,1577796598.0,"I try to teach respect of animals before I kick a child out of my home, mostly because I know that if I dont they could be severely hurt later in life. If my words fall on deaf ears and the parent wont do it, however, they can get the fuck out.

My 10 year old sister and 2 year old niece are very fortunate to have grown up around animals and therefore know my pets boundaries, but occasionally I have to remind them that the cat doesnt, in fact, want to be held for very long."

People who get dogs because ""my dog is lonely"" likely dont understand their animal. Some dogs do prefer company yes, but not all do."
