The real kicker though was cross country,  which we were forced into if we wanted to play basketball. Starting a month before school we would have 2-3 practices a day, then from the start of school until November/December  we would have practice at 5:30 till 6:30 then usually getting to school 6:50 without having ate (eating before practice was counterproductive) and needing showers. 

After school we would have more practices, sometimes going from basketball practice at 5 pm to cross country until 6:30 or 7pm. Rinse and repeat. My mom accused me of being on drugs because I would nap all the time on the weekends, the disconnect was real."
todayilearned,ff5o40z,t1_ff5ndwh,1579602721.0,"Depends on the state, I know my school wouldn't have been able to do that as a ""school day"" in my state was more strictly/loosely regulated. It may be different now but a day counted at 5 hours, so some srs would set it up to go home at 12 (we were 7-2:30) 

They also set a 2 week period at the beginning and end of the school year that all schools in the state have to start and end on so that factors in a lot."

DeFranco,fexkw1f,t1_fexed2z,1579432650.0,"Yeah worker protection is extremely thin in America. You can totally win in the case of a ""wrongful termination"" but the bar for that is extremely high and the burden of proof is entirely on the worker, who of course wont have access to most, if not all of the evidence. 

For some examples  


Less than a week ago a former coworker turned in her two week notice and was walked off that very moment, no reason given. Obviously in response to her notice   


Last month a coworker was fired for using the wrong tool for a job, despite the tool they used being the normal provided tool that we were all trained to use. We never signed new training update forms as we normally would for such a change (and we still have not since the firing). This is the one and only time we haven't signed these forms, and they instead relied on word of mouth and told only 2 workers on one shift of the change and where to get the new tool (something im actually not aware of still, after over a month). Now we are a union job, so everyone expected this to be an easy win for us, and for her to be back at work. The reality is however that the  employment commission of my state just took the companies ""violated training policy"" excuse at face, and the union refused to defend the worker. I later found that the union only fights for white workers when a coworker mistook me as white (I am the same race as the fired employee) and spilled the beans. Unless you have a recording (video in some states, audio is not taken seriously in Texas at least) then you really have no ground to stand on. No different than your boss grabbing your butt at work, you cant really prove much of anything and might get harassed for coming forward. 

  


I personally lost a job in 2015 after filling harassment against a woman who was following me, screaming and cursing, across the building and to my desk where she stood and continued to yell. My supervisor and other workers witnessed it yet a week later I was walked out. They told me that in such an incident they have  a zero tolerance policy and that we were both being let go. So I of course fought back when I found out she was only written up for her language and the labor board told me then that unless I could prove they violated a protected class that I was SOL. The company that fired me also provided the labor board with 3 write ups that they forged my name on. The thing is, i didn't trust that boss at all and actually had audio of every supposed ""disciplinary meeting"" which were actually just normal every day work related meetings related to projects and such. I was told that audio isnt admissible on it's own as it has no context and only proves that at some point in the same day, we had a work related meeting. 

 

Another job in 2016 walked out 3 people one month in order to cut back because ""Hilary is gonna win"" (we were oil related)

&#x200B;

My last 3 jobs have facebook rules, so if you have a facebook it needs to be public, if you were found to be hiding a private one then you were out. Not having a facebook was an option however.   


Friend of mine got hit by a go cart while working and the supervisor wouldn't let them go home, or even to the Dr. They ended up clocking out and leaving anyways as it turned out his foot was broken. Counts as a walk off of course, voluntary. I guess the state also felt the company had no obligation to help am injured worker. I pushed for him to sue but he was 19 at the time and most people don't have the time or money to fight something like that, even more so when it will more than likely be a waste. 

My current job wont consider you as sick unless you're gone for 3 days and have a note saying you were sick for all 3 of them. So if you have the flu for two days your SOL. We get 7 chances all year, in a state that at any given day for 7 months of the year we might get up to 10+ inches of snow in just a couple hours. Getting sick for two days but not the 3rd takes away 2/7 so a bad storm, maybe you have a sick kid after you yourself was sick. Boom 4/7 days in less than a month. The thing is, we've had people fired for missing their 7th day while violently sick, one even throwing up in the factory (FOOD!) and leaving early. Each case the state waves away as it's an issue with overall attendance apparently.

Unrelated and on another topic, nearly every job ive had has played games with or stolen peoples wages, including my current job. In my current case we were ""allowed"" to punch in 7 minutes before shift change in order to have time to change into the uniform and such. After a year or so I noticed they wernt paying us for that, regardless of if you punched in 5 till, 3 till or the max 7 till. So I did some digging and found that with my company and job type the law only allows for 5 unpaid minutes, meaning that 2 extra minutes were being stolen in the cases of people clocking in right at 53. I mentioned it to a few coworkers and a few of us tried to get a technical answer from our union rep first. So he argued that our contract states that we have until 5 after to be at the shift meeting, so we were really getting a good deal as the could just make punch in at the top of the hour and then only give us all five minutes to get out. This would be physically impossible as the entrance only lets one person into the plant every 15-30 seconds, and all of us lined up, dressed, at the exact moment the hour changed would still take 3-5 minutes to get inside. They have so many obstacles and hoops (food production, on the higher risk side of things, so it's needed for sure) before we can even get inside that clocking in right on time would almost 100% guarantee you to be late on the floor even if everyone else was already inside. The best part, is that if you are there more than 5 minutes after the hour it counts as 1/2 a point against you, out of the 7 I mentioned before. So you pretty much have to clock in early. The way i play it is to always clock in at :56 but im actually not sure if they dont just take 5 minutes off of everyone regardless of when they clock in or out. So im in the middle of figuring that out. Since my initial questioning however, the contract was renegotiated (something they do every 5 years) and the time was changed from 7 minutes to 5 minutes before the shift in the official contract. So im thinking I was onto something. 

I dont really want to push too hard on these type of things right now though as I make $23/h in an area where the average is >$17/h and overall my company is the 2nd highest paying of the major employers of the area, the first being a paper mill with a super high risk of injury, whereas my job has had 1 major injury in the past 5 years. So in the end i'm contributing the the complacency that is rotting our country's core"

It wasnt until my 3rd year that things really took off and I think a lot of that is due to me mixing it up more as I went. We would do 3 miles at least in the morning and have basketball which involved a lot of sprints in the afternoon. The key was running another 3 to 6 miles after the basketball practice and ending with another set of sprints. The last set of sprints feel exactly like the last few hundred on a hard 5k, and I think helps allot with conditioning for the worst parts of the run. 

The major downside of this was a lot of my teammates got shin splints from the fuel practices and surface changes, and I eventually damaged my left knee and gave up running for the most part.
