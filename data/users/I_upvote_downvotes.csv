>there were conflicting reports about the departure city and destination 

That's a whole lot of popups for so little information. Thanks again, the mirror."
japancirclejerk,ffpd9ks,t1_ffp0b2g,1580092156.0,">why does it have to be Japan?

Well judging from this:

>Yet Japan's reluctance to change very rapidly is exactly why I seek to relocate. I believe the culture of the western world is being ripped apart

I'd go with... Anime nazi?"
trashy,ffpatxo,t1_ffoap56,1580090448.0,"Imagine paying $100 a month for rent and then losing it because you're being an asshole. If I was only charged 100 bucks where I live, I'd be cleaning THEIR shit as well as my own.

It's not even me being a nice person. That rent alone is taking advantage. If I was fleecing someone of hundreds in rent, I just wouldn't go with ""Okay let's make them want to kick you out."" 

That's like if the salvation army guy yelled ""SHITBIRD!"" every time someone put money in their box."
ShittyLifeProTips,ffn2il1,t1_ffmezh8,1580061297.0,People below you are right when they say they're relatively cheap. But judging how much I've seen people modify their ender 3's it's definitely a hobby project on its own.
dreamcast,ffmrfpo,t1_ffkyxxf,1580058148.0,"Thankfully it's easily reversible since the disc drive is practically modular, but I wouldn't bother if you have a bunch of legit games you want to play.

It really is the better option if you're going to be burning 100 discs though. The DC is not like the psx or saturn: many of these games exceed the 750mb limit of cd's, so the rips of them end up cutting visual fidelity in movies, music, and in some rare cases actual content. It's just not a good way to enjoy the dreamcast anymore.

That and the drive screams like a banshee anyway, so many of us are glad to make it quieter."
trashy,ffksh3n,t1_ffjmzhk,1580028079.0,Vargas is like the god damn pissed off terminator the entire time. I think Salka learned a thing or two about not pissing off someone you're about to fight.
dreamcast,ffjmayr,t1_ffhupuq,1580001538.0,"There is no need for boot discs anymore. Most CDI files of quality out there are self booting. 

I'm not sure if it's okay to discuss things like DCres rips and where to get them, but certain ripping teams have varying quality that you'd need to look into.

Or you could look into just getting a Gdemu. They're cheap (*cough* AliExpress *cough*), easy to install, requires zero solder work, and you won't have to hear your disc drive scream at you."
OutOfTheLoop,ffjlb9e,t1_ffjjmxu,1580000860.0,"1.4 million people identified as trans. That's not a couple million operations or sterilizations. You just added 600,000 imaginary people to a statistic that has nothing to do with operations. From a study you clearly didn't read before sending it my way. 

>this isn't cited either

You want them to cite their own study?

What's your argument exactly? ""I'll send that dude false information and hope he doesn't notice""?"
worldnews,ffjj7ko,t1_ffjdu9n,1579999440.0,"Can the inferior catapult do this as well?



No."
OutOfTheLoop,ffjhy9p,t1_ffjdw2u,1579998605.0,">This goes along with what I was saying originally: that we are going to see a generation of people who were sterilized and maimed

To which I wrote that there's not enough of a population to create a generational impact (0.58%) To which you said that statistic was incorrect by writing ""perhaps historically""... and linked 0.58%.

You then went on to state that it's more than DOUBLED in a ""few years"". Neither study you linked states that. Both studies state that the increase was due to an improved stratified sample. the 17 year old data does not equate to ""a few.""

Why am I being given disingenuous information from you? And why are you ignoring it when I point it out? Are you expecting me to ignore that?"
OutOfTheLoop,ffjcqsg,t1_ffjb8d6,1579995544.0,">""It's a very small percentage that is doubling every few years"" is the point I was making, but I'm glad that you feel good about yourself for missing it.

You didn't make any point because you didn't write that. Please actually write your points if you want me to interpret them. I am incapable of mindreading.

>It's a very small percentage that is doubling every few years

No it doesn't:

>In 2011, Gary J. Gates utilized two state-level population-based surveys that collected data from 2003 in California and  from  2007  and  2009  in  Massachusetts  to  estimate  that  0.3%  of  the  U.S.  adult  population,  roughly  700,000  adults, identified as transgender.2  Since then, more state-level data sources have emerged that allow us to utilize an estimation procedure that would not have been possible with the limited data available in 2011

That's on the first page. You need to actually *read* the damn thing."
