memes,ffnr7b4,t3_eua1o0,1580069668.0,There is also probability which plays into genetics such as using a monohybrid and dihybrid cross to figure out what alleles and dominant/recessive genes you have to discover the genetic variety of the offspring. Which is probably more maths but still a science. I might be forgetting some stuff.
pcgaming,ffnqzk4,t1_ffnq7hz,1580069581.0,They still get data collected by play time. Nothing is free or they give adds. That way you pay with your free time which could be spent doing better things or playing games made by better developers.

pcgaming,ffneyrp,t3_eu9n1k,1580065104.0,As my small way of contributing to protesting anti consumerism and anti exclusivity I have decided not to buy or play any games on Epic store even if they came to Steam. Don't care if they are free to play and it sucks that I can't play some good games like Metro Exodus but there are tons of other games to play. Steam might not be that good either but I don't like it when they remove our choice of where to buy games. Not to mention all the other issues with Epic Games.

unpopularopinion,ffm7gm1,t3_eu503j,1580049724.0,"Though waking up in a cold room is way worse because it is much harder to get out of bed. When I wake up in a hot room I kick off the covers and want to get out of bed and go have a shower cause of sweat. But in a cold room it's warm and cozy and cold makes you sleepy. But yeah at the same time cold is more comfortable to sleep in. Though that's because of evolution. Our cave men ancestors were evolved to want to sleep in cold dark caves. So humans naturally prefer a cool, dark place to sleep."

wholesomememes,ffijbfq,t1_ffi8iho,1579975229.0,You have to ask questions in class in order to learn. Just listening to the teacher does not do all the learning. Plus taking notes in class is one of the best ways to help the lesson sink in. Also you should definitely do additional reading though most modules have a reading list as well but class is important. If you want to get the most out of your course you know why it's good. I shouldn't have to explain to a university student how to study. You're an adult and can make your own decisions. You don't have to attend lessons but it's much better if you do.

And they make lots of noise and smells and poo. If you are happy with cleaning them, feeding them, taking them to the vet and have enough garden space for a duck then go for it but keep in mind ducks are social animals and usually live in groups so need at least 2 or 3 ducks."
