TooAfraidToAsk,ffi0ni0,t3_etl02h,1579961473.0,"We are the current best, yes. But that will change with time. But we gave the world the automobile, the telephone, flight, the computer, the internet, etc. Our media (music, tv shows, movies) are the best in the world. We have the greatest influence of any nation since the British Empire. There’s a reason people are migrating north to the Mexico US border instead of going south to Brazil or other countries. Millions across the globe try to immigrate here each year.  How many people immigrate to Russia or China each year?"
TrueOffMyChest,ffgf0cu,t1_ffgcxax,1579904761.0,"What’s your dictionary say about pedophilia or bestiality?  Again, sexuality is a spectrum.  No one likes to think of bestiality as its fucking gross but according to the dictionary’s definition its not a form of sexuality as it does not deal with gender, but species preferences. So what is it then?  I just feel like the dictionary may not have a full view of the spectrum which is sexuality."

TrueOffMyChest,fffu4ku,t1_ffeefp5,1579891840.0,"But maybe there are 200 sexualities. Why stop with just gay or bi just because you guys “won”. Where’s the support for ALL forms of sexual attraction? Sapiosexual, bisexual, etc"
TrueOffMyChest,ffftwls,t3_et5f4s,1579891704.0,"Sexuality is a spectrum. Pedophilia is on that spectrum whether you like it or not. So is bestiality. It is up to society to determine which portion of the spectrum is viewed as acceptable. Recently, people have changed society’s views on homosexuality, bisexuality, etc. But for ages it was frowned upon. Now, it is you who is frowning upon people who identify with a portion of the spectrum you’re not comfortable with. Kinda makes you a bigot if you ask me."

Now, going back to your nazi example. If the police force AS A WHOLE began rounding up people as they were instructed to by the state, then that’s a WHOLE other story.

news,fcj5x07,t1_fciw61q,1577678055.0,"America is the largest producer of firearms in the world. Mainly for the US military who uses them in wars around the world. These weapons are then often times left in the war torn country because it’s expensive to ship them back. They then make their way into the black market. Make guns illegal? Only law abiding citizens would be negatively impacted.  Look at Europe. Bad guy doesn’t have a gun? They then choose to drive vans through crowds. What are you going to do to stop it? Outlaw vehicles?  

Where there is a will, there is a way. 

What ACTUALLY makes America more dangerous? Not the guns. But, the fact that mental healthcare and therapy are usually not covered under health insurance. It is not taken seriously here. Take away guns and people with issues will either make a bomb (stupidly easy to do with online instructions) or drive vehicles into crowds. Taking away our guns is nothing but a bandaid for the issue. 

People always ask, “how many people need to be shot before you’ll give up your right to bear arms?”

May as well ask, “how many women need to be raped before you cut your dick off?”

My dick has never raped. So, cutting it off would do little to fix the issue of rape. So too has my gun never been used illegally. Take my gun away and it will not stop a motivated killer from getting one anyway."
