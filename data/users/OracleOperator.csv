politics,ffdjfpy,t3_et0jqj,1579822153.0,"The real problems that should be addressed are income equality, care for veterans and seniors, job placement programs, employment enrichment, the right to free healthcare and a college education. We could do so much with the money that is wasted on foreign aid, wars and government benefits. Infrastructure and the enrichment of our citizens whether it be personal, mental or career oriented are major necessities continually over looked by the conservative and wealthy politicians that plague our governments. With this we would drastically reduce the need for welfare."

insaneparents,feysmub,t3_eqvwft,1579450112.0,That woman is insanely disrespectful and rude. Honestly I would have to cut her and that book of Morman off.
insaneparents,feyech5,t1_fexowjr,1579444323.0,Your right I went to Cleveland schools in the 90s where that money went into the pockets of administrators instead of teachers. Then after Barbara Byrd Bennett fucked up our schools she went to Chicago and did it to them. I believe she was arrested though.
insaneparents,feydfoj,t3_eqns4n,1579444112.0,So missing assignments are a lack of caring and if the parents don't care that is more reason for the child not too. Some children and teenagers mimic the behavior of the parents. That particular parent's cocky attitude and lack of accountability will create failure for his/her child.
FragileWhiteRedditor,feybtfl,t3_eqqo5z,1579443429.0,What a beautiful couple. OP is just pissed he can't score such a beautiful young lady. I hate those kinds of people they're the worst kind of bullies.

I almost never see a kid with a book these days. We used to collect bugs, use our imagination when playing. The list goes on. I fear children today will never know what it's like to use their imagination because everything they could possibly see is on a damn ipad."

Conservative,feu63qp,t1_ferufoh,1579383446.0,Thats straight up bullshit. If I dont agree with you and your President I'm a hater with demons to hide? It's called a difference of opinion and we all have one in the real world. Suck it up and move on instead of whining about people who don't agree with you. That's life. Honestly are you a child?

AskReddit,fercw50,t3_eq9k9o,1579352432.0,Arctic Monkeys. Idk if it was an off day but they didnt sound great at all. The venue was also outside so I'm not sure if that contributed to the sound quality. However I saw The Toadies 15-20 years after their first album and they were fucking awesome.
aww,fep87zg,t1_feoxto2,1579314335.0,I couldn't agree more. Besides those weird slime  videos of adults in their mid 30s in a mansion with kiddie pools of slime and squishy beads. Like wtf is going on!?  I must be doing this 30s shit wrong.

politics,fdizc1o,t1_fdiw5z6,1578454531.0,No this was the retaliation from Iran. If America wants to be the school yard bully your gonna get knocked down too. What we need now is a mediation. This shit needs to be squashed. There's no good reason we have troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. Bin laden is dead and we had no business going to Iraq in the first place. Let the middle east squabble their own problems out.

worldnews,fdii69y,t3_eljp1u,1578443462.0,So when is this little bitch ass President getting his ass on TV in a state of the union address? He started this fight and we deserve that much. We need an explanation for this. Had we started pulling troops out months ago when when that orange cheeto claimed to have eradicated Isis we wouldn't be dealing with this nonsense. I'm tired of my money being spent on wars. We could have nice things but these fuckers ruin everything. I don't want to hear this bs excuse they were going to attack us. Now they did because of that retard Trump. I wish someone would kick him in his dick.

IAmA,fcw2n3s,t1_fcvza90,1578015721.0,Wow how rude and disrespectful you are. It's truly unfortunate you would rather spew hatred and filth to someone who has lived an entire life time instead of using this opportunity to learn. You should be grateful someone is willing to share some life experiences with you.
IAmA,fcw1bl5,t1_fcw0sdz,1578014857.0,Well let's say he or a family member did attempt to search for him it's likely they could have lost their lives for lying to the Nazi's about their Jewish heritage in the first place.
IAmA,fcw0ext,t3_ej5wwp,1578014262.0,This is a weird question but I'm sure someone has the answer on here. What happened to German's who didn't fit the Aryan utopia image of blonde hair and blue eyes?

worldpolitics,fcbbviz,t1_fcb7kb8,1577584970.0,That's really fucked up there's no one you can go to about this. Where I live making threats to kill people is taken very seriously and its likely my local FBI office would have taken over this rather than the police. I do know there are some crazys out there but I refuse to let those kind of people have a say in how I will live my life. I will never give anyone that power. Like spray painting Trump on stuff who the fuck does that? And besides it being vandalism and someone else working hard to clean it up what real message does it send? That they're fucking crazy and would attempt to hurt the victim? Honestly if someone did that shit to me and I knew who it was I would go bat shit crazy on them. Like I know the mob kinda crazy lol Like I might flip a table housewives style and break some dishes and then beat their fucking car with a baseball bat. I know here I am taking about these psychos and I am willing to go Italian housewife on someone ðŸ˜‚ but thats no joke talking about killing people. And honestly there's a real comparison to people who say and do that shit and some extremist in Isis. Their religions might be different but the ideas are the same.
worldpolitics,fcb7igd,t1_fcb29dv,1577583371.0,Lol what makes you think I'm a he? And why the hell would I cry? Sure I want to see positive changes for our country but if that asshole cheeto king becomes president again it's no skin off my back. I still have to continue working to support all the rural brother cousins with their welfare queens who voted for him.
worldpolitics,fcb5tv3,t1_fcb10jp,1577582745.0,If people you know make threats about shooting other people does it ever cross your mind that maybe you should tell law enforcement? Or do you think they're just blowing smoke up each others asses to feel better about themselves? Sounds like you know some dangerous people.
worldpolitics,fcb42ds,t1_fcb1kni,1577582077.0,No because we enjoy doing this kind of stuff to each other...
worldpolitics,fcb2kpq,t1_fc9rbr6,1577581476.0,"Soviet agression is a tricky subject. For a long time America feared communism and asserted our military into a senseless war over our anti communist interests. When the communist Soviet Union eventually collapsed 90s that wasn't all due to an American effort, Eastern Europeans who lived behind the iron curtain saw the negative impacts communism had on their freedom and quality of life. Look at Russian agression today, Trump admires Putin. We need a genuine effort for peace rather then having to just foot the bill all the time."
worldpolitics,fcb1h1d,t3_egpent,1577580861.0,"I keep donating to Bernie's campaign. It's not much but so far I'm at 7 dollars. And his campaign sent some awesome sickers I've used to harass my Trump supporter friends. :) Most importantly I know he will stand up for everyone when it comes to healthcare, the pharmaceutical industry, the environment, social programs and corporations. We also need changes to our food policies. The stuff that is sold in the stores, processed food etc is awful for us. It's literally killing people."
