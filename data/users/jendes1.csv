dogs,ffbebbx,t3_esntal,1579761634.0,"When my mom’s dog reached the age of 12 the hip dysplasia started to set in. We took her to vet and got some meds to help. But after a year her back legs wouldn’t work so good anymore so my mom gave her one last summer at the lake and then said good bye to her. It’s hard to make that decision but when it comes down to quality versus quaint always go with the quality of life. You will always have the wonderful memories of you beloved dog, the pictures and the stories of good time they gave too. They will always have a piece of your heart and you can take some happiness in that they are with the rest of your loved one waiting for you. I’m sorry for you and your dog."
dogs,ffbdl7f,t3_esntqu,1579760815.0,Just keep an eye on it. I had a dog that was adopted and I knew he was going to be a “big” dog but what we got was one of the best dog we ever had! He was 50 cm  at the shoulder and had nerve tremors in his front legs. He could do everything we ask and no problems with his leg for his life span. Yes they would shake when he sat but he never noticed. Our vet would check the nerves on every visit and nothing ever came of it.
dogs,ff3fw7u,t3_ereyp7,1579540215.0,Welcome!! Husky dig in everything and my vet was cool enough to tell me how to treat it without coming every time.
dogs,ff3fj4j,t3_ereyp7,1579540018.0,When my husky x had a sore red paw the vet said to use Epsom salts in warm water and soak her paw twice day and dry very well and no licking it.

dogs,fepu6tb,t3_eq70b3,1579331423.0,I will take my dogs to an empty field because I know they don’t like other dogs. I keep a good eye on them while we play ball or they are just running around. Dog parks are a no go for me.
dogs,fenfa4g,t3_epzhmb,1579283439.0,"I have 4 children and 3 dogs and 2 cats. It’s a lot but I wouldn’t change it for the world!! My dogs are 60 pounds +, they are well taken care of and get lots of cuddles. As my children got older they played more with dogs. If you and partner think you can handle it then go for it."
dogs,feiqqcr,t3_epbpkj,1579144835.0,"In all the year I have owned dogs I have learned one of the most important things, not every one person trains their dogs in the same way. So if I’m interacting with a dog that is not mine I will ask the owner what type of words they would like me to use to make their dog sit if it jumps up or what hand signals they would like me to use or listen to them if they say please don’t pet or come near the dog. It’s called respect for the owners and their fur babies."
dogs,fe3z14w,t3_engklo,1578854169.0,"I wont deal with rescues for that very reason. I have always had and have large dogs, one time I thought I would talk to a rescue about adopting one of their larger dogs and they said no. Even after I explained that I have had large dogs in the past and do have the room for them they still said no based on return rates so I went to our local shelter and adopted from their large dogs. We had him for his entire life from 3 month right up till his pasting in 2016 one of the best dog ever!!"
dogs,fe3tsi9,t3_ennfwo,1578852792.0,Go back to the doctors!! I had a cat bite and the pill form of the antibiotics didn’t work so I had to them by iv for week
dogs,fe3ni79,t3_enp9ke,1578851011.0,I know this is going to sound weird but do you have a light on when you put him to sleep? I’ve had a lot of dogs over the year but one of the dogs needed a night light. He would play all day and was fine to into the kennel for the night but around 2am he would start howling and whining waking up my whole house. No matter what I tried he wouldn’t settle down (yes I did toys and treats and even took him to bed with us) after about 3 weeks of it I thought what do I have to lose by trying a night light. I just went to the dollar store and got a push button light and put it in his kennel with him. We finally got some sleep! He used the light for about 2 weeks and then didn’t need anymore.
dogs,fdnfu92,t3_emazew,1578584909.0,I know you said that your dog is a bit head shy but you can alway ask your vet if wearing a T-shirt would work as well. My dog also just had some stitches in and with having two other dogs cones are not the best option for my household. The T-shirt gave she more freedom and stop her from licking at the stitches.
