wholesomememes,ff103uq,t3_eqztjx,1579473953.0,"My grandpa (86) is a AF vet and grew up in rural Tennessee with no electricity or plumbing. His family grew tobacco, eventually he moved to Michigan and worked for GM. In recent years he’s starting to lose his memories and he gets confused easily. I try to see him every few weeks. He always tells me the same stories but I don’t care his life is interesting and I will sit for hours and listen to him. He still has passion in his eyes. I’m grateful for anytime I get with him."

2. Grunting(I don’t mind a little noise but I when I can hear you over on the other side of the gym that’s excessive.
3. At the gym I use to go to we had a lot of older folks who had nothing but time would take forever on the machines. I’m taking 20-30 minutes sometimes.
