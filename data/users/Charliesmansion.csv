The girls in our group of friends have no judgment when the gay men do “feminine” things, but if I allow that side of myself to be expressed it is not received in the same way, because I’m straight so I’m supposed to always act a specific way."

insanepeoplefacebook,feg69x8,t1_fef3zrz,1579078942.0,I’ve always thought of numbers like puzzle pieces that add up to multiples of tens. The shapes compliment each other in my head. Is it similar to that?

AskReddit,fdrjckz,t1_fdqkdz4,1578685283.0,"I’ll second this. I had autoship set for a dog food that my dog ended up having an allergic reaction to, I forgot to cancel the autoship and only remembered when I got an email that it had been shipped. I got on their chat and they canceled the shipment and refunded me. I was really impressed."

I just saw that superliminal is a few months away for the platforms I have access to (PS4 and steam link). I’ve got grad school starting again in a few days and it would be good for me to pick a game up to destress before classes start. Thanks for the suggestions and reply."
interestingasfuck,fd48z1w,t1_fd416j3,1578165429.0,"I really don’t play games. I liked them when I was a kid and I have a PS4 but I’ll buy games and play them once, I just don’t have the attention span. I bought portal 2 and half life 2 a few years ago. I got bored of half life after 30 min but I finally started portal just a few months ago and I played for hours for several days. 

I’m saying all of this to ask you if those games you mentioned would be worth checking out for someone like me? I love puzzle games but I also love the humor and sci-fi aspect of portal. when I google articles and lists for games like portal I often get stuff that isn’t even close but it looks like the stuff you out here is actually similar."

If you have access to healthcare, see a doctor about your depression. As a healthcare professional myself, depression is a real illness and you can get better."
