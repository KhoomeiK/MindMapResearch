my rent for a single room plus bathroom and kitchen use is $350 a month. I also pay $120 for my utilities, that's half my pay.  On top of this I have to pay for my basic medical care costs that my insurance doesn't fully cover which is between $90-120 a month depending on if it's a blood work month or not.

Now I personally have debt that costs $120 which is my own fault for seeking higher education instead of just accepting homelessness right out of high school, so that's on me.

When I listed my utilities, for the purposes here I am NOT counting water, as I listed it as a separate need, my utilities are electric ($50, on a budget plan) and gas ($70, on assistance) water is $90 a month for minimum service, plus any usage after x gallons (I'm not sure how many tbh), I use very sparingly, so my bill is usually at $90.

Now for food, I can be pretty frugal, I can survive on about $200 a month if I'm careful and plan my meals out correctly (if you're working full time you shouldn't need to resort to ramen and beans and rice.) 

My car is paid off, thankfully, it was a gift and I am eternally grateful to have a reliable efficient vehicle, about $30 in gas every other week gets me where I need to be and back, I rarely go anywhere but work and the grocery store.  I have to shop at three separate stores to ensure I can get what I need.

I work FULL TIME, I do not believe that those working retail should become rich from it, however these companies have the means to pay their employees enough to live semi-comfortably (necessities paid for, food on the table, and a modest amount in savings for an emergency) they choose not to entirely out of greed."

The entirety of fighter pass 1 to this point has been amazing and excited, new franchises, unexpected characters! Had you told me Terry would get in, no way I'd have believed it, same for Hero, Banjo, and Joker.  Had you told me Byleth however, yeah, that makes sense, seems like an obvious choice especially with Sakurai's love of FE.

Now. As a result, the excitement built for this massively secret final character, then just... Popped. There was no payoff for this ""unexpected surprise"" it ended up just leaving a lot of people sitting there thinking ""I got up early for THIS?"" 

I'm going to try the character, they look fun as hell, I'm happy for the people that wanted him in, and I'm happy for the voice actor. I'm just let down by it.

This EASILY could have been mitigated as well. Had he been released in slot 2-3 there would have been SOME disappointment, but not NEAR this level.

Essentially what we are disappointed about I just the complete lack of payoff for the build up that led us here, I personally regained a bit of the excitement upon announcement of Pass 2. But I fear after the incredibly taunting nature of this announcement that the numbers for pass 2 will be lower than expected and as a result pass 3 will not happen (and don't tell me it wasn't taunting, it was meant as playful but many will not take it that way)
