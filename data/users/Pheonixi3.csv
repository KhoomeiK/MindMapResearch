The reason consistency is not always important is because certain consistencies create inconsistencies. Mids never get crushed, but they can be evaded, and that creates an inconsistency in the execution of moves. Do you make mids un-evadable? Now you've created an inconsistency with hitboxes. It's a never ending chain of self destruction. You can't focus on infinite consistency."

Listen dude I've said the same thing 3 times but you've missed the point every time. Lore is not a balancing mechanic. If King has the stronger whiff punishing f2,1 then he has it.

If AK is *already* someone who specializes in whiff punishing, then this tool shouldn't be that important to him anyway, and if you were really trying to get good you'd whiff punish with dark upper.

They don't have an archetype that we make and decide, their moves create that archetype.

Maybe Asuka should have it because she's already good at whiff punishing. <- This is basically what you're saying."
Tekken,ff8i1ub,t1_ff8hsd2,1579679432.0,"What I'm saying is that it doesn't make sense. Who cares who had it originally? King was the original grappler. Can there only be one grappler?

Why is King not allowed to be stronger? Why does him being stronger mean that other people get his moves? There's no reason for this to be important when discussing a character's strength. Does this mean no one in the game is allowed a long range hit confirmable mid high? Why? You're not thinking clearly.

edit: balancing around lore is a chump move too"
Tekken,ff8hl3k,t1_ff8exm7,1579678833.0,"if you're going off original moves then half of AK's kit should be deleted and replaced with something else as he was a clone and all his moves are developments off that.

How did they arrive at that decision? Why won't they change their mind? What makes you know you're right and they're not?
