MLPtunes,fgk8da2,t3_eyzj07,1580859687.0,Love this remix so much! Also Melodosis is one of the most underrated musicians our fandom had. They have quite a few songs I really enjoy! c:
PhonesAreBad,fgk5zwg,t3_eyrmwf,1580858217.0,"I don't like these kind of posts either. But it has a point. What do you do with a crappy video of event you went to? I don't know anyone who said ""hmm let me take and watch these 15 minutes of a video I took at a concert"" like what is a point of that? Also I saw several musicians who are pissed by the fact that they come playing in front of the crowd and only thing they see are freaking phones in the air.

KamikazeByWords,fghhd2e,t1_fghgvx0,1580784848.0,There is a difference between wrestling a shooter and telling people not to be a jerks. You don't risk your life to tell people to act nice. It is simple thing and besides the fact that it discourages the aggressor it also shows the member of your community someone cares about their issue.
KamikazeByWords,fghgyly,t1_fghg2fe,1580784588.0,"Nobody denies that there are sexists in feminist community. I mean every group has horrible members. What defines group is how do they treat those horrible members. But that is not really important. ""They also do bad things!"" is a bad excuse not to correct your behavior. P.S. I'm talking about gaming community not you in specific"
KamikazeByWords,fghgjbq,t1_fghfqvt,1580784317.0,It is far from good though. Here is a hiperbole to explain it in easiest way. You see one person choking another person and you know that if you don't do anything aggressor will kill the victim. It basically isn't your problem. I mean you don't own that person a thing. But on another hand you are the only way that person can be helped.
KamikazeByWords,fghej4r,t1_fghdt6n,1580783066.0,"Well you are talking here with me about this subject. Telling someone ""cut the racist bullshit"" requires much less effort and will make them know their stances aren't okay. I'm not saying that it's solely your job but one of a gaming community as a whole."
KamikazeByWords,fghe59y,t1_fghc2om,1580782824.0,It's nice to hear that from someone who got in pro scene. But yes I guess this is some recent events (Like a huge backlash by Mordhau community) heavily reinforced by personal experiences.
KamikazeByWords,fghd5zd,t1_fghca2p,1580782199.0,"When it comes to racism, sexism and general harassment there is no neutral party. Either you speak up against person preforming it or you are passively supporting it."

KamikazeByWords,fgh2y32,t1_fgh1pxm,1580775440.0,I agree it isn't very nice but gaming community will often support and encourage racist and toxic behavior. Not all gamers are bad but there are lot of them who are and aren't causing any backlash from the community which is a problem

meirl,fgeeuoo,t1_fge2o2y,1580697937.0,Well it doesn't matter is it fun or not if there is a service that needs to be preformed. Also different people find different things fun. I can't stand being around small kids while my friend loves it. Same goes for many things. I don't think you need to be overjoyed about your job but doing something you don't like for 8 hours a day is really sad.

You sound like a good person."
DanceTutorials,fg4i6is,t1_fg4g5sq,1580503743.0,"Listen friend, I know it's scary to be by yourself and that is exact reason why you need help. Psyhologists don't close people in mental institutions on a whim, a friend of mine attempted suicide and they still didn't close her down in one. She has been going to therapist continously and right now she is a happy girl that goes to college and has a boyfriend. Of course it isn't easy. But you have strenght to do the right thing."
DanceTutorials,fg4f65a,t3_ews6do,1580502284.0,Hi. First of all I hope you are okay. Idk where you are from but I would strongly suggest to talk with your family about visiting a psychologist. They tend to make these issues much better. I can tell you from personal experience that it helps greatly. There are people that care about you. About the dancing. It doesn't really require that much space. You can even try doing it in park or such. However dancing is one of those things that is hard to learn by yourself. You should really try and look some classes up. It could even help you socialize and feel better.
bropill,fg4ea4j,t3_ewtsji,1580501861.0,Onset muscle soreness is normal after long time of not doing any strength training. It might seem counter intuitive but try doing same exercises in lighter variation (less weight) to increase the blood flow and help your muscles regenerate.
