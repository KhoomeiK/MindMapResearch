I am genuinely curious and have no ill will towards you. Is it solely because of his ways of implementing those laws or is it more personal? Do you believe there was no way of getting South Korea out of being a 3rd world country unless there were some ""harsh policies""? Would the common people back then not have known better? Does being a progressive and liberal ever make you think it clashes with those ideologies? What do you think would've happened if the corrupt government gave way to a Bernie Sanders-like president? I will seriously try to understand the other viewpoint and think on it.

I actually lived 2 blocks away from Park Geun Hye's house during her impeachment and saw the supporters rallied there those several nights and wondered if they supported her or just her father's legacy.
