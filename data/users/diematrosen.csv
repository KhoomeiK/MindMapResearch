And I wasn’t “demanding” anything lol idk why you keep trying to put this label on me. Quite frustrating really 

Anyways, I just wanted to say it’s not a nice feeling to have a complete stranger automatically assume your intent is from a wrong place from the get-go. I hope this is not how you treat other guys in real life because perhaps they could gain insight from you rather than you dismissing them"
offmychest,fdnklmk,t1_fdmrzle,1578587765.0,"I’m not being dishonest, guys within my social circle nor myself would tie a woman’s worth to her looks. I’m currently doing an internship in my 2nd year of college and if there is a woman who is competent, I would treat her the exact same way I would treat a guy with competent skills. So do a lot of guys I work with. I think times are changing

Like I said, I agree there are men out there who match your description but there are also plenty of men who don’t just like how there are women who fit less than desirable archetypes but from what I’ve seen there are plenty of women who also go against that archetype that I’m not bitter about the women who do exhibit these attributes. 

Is there a proportion problem when it comes to success of men and success of women and is there a problem where some women aren’t respected for their respective skills? Yes, but there are also so many variables at play that it’s naive to just say men bad, woman good. I get your frustration because it sucks to be objectified but please realize not all men are like this and we’re moving further and further into an era where more and more women are getting the recognition they deserve"
offmychest,fdmph5r,t1_fdmm266,1578559378.0,"Let me put it out there first that your opinion and emotions are 100% valid because if that’s how you feel, that’s how you feel but to me, it seems like a very negative way of viewing things. I’m not sure if your worldview is due to past experiences or past relationships but I really don’t think the idea that a woman’s worth is tied to being beautiful is as widespread a notion as you believe yourself to be. Sure, I agree, some guys do think like this but there’s plenty of guys who don’t too"

I ordered one off Amazon a couple days ago because the price was way too good to turn down. How’s your experience with it?

offmychest,fdmnkpo,t1_fdmmdqu,1578556917.0,"I was actually genuinely curious though, I don’t know how else I could’ve expressed my genuine curiosity other than using ‘genuinely curious.’ I’m very sorry if you were offended but I’m going to keep expressing my thoughts through words as I see fit because conveying a tone through text is already hard enough as it is

Maybe you projected and assumed I had a disingenuous curiosity for some reason? In that case, I can assure you it was genuine curiosity nothing more nothing less

Have a nice day"
offmychest,fdmlsor,t1_fdmevx0,1578554800.0,"To add: I think it also goes further than teaching young boys not to do this and not to do that when it comes to the opposite gender. I think empathy is a strong motivator in allowing people to do the right thing. Once boys understand what girls go through on a daily basis, they’ll probably think twice about their actions as they mature and turn into men"
offmychest,fdmln78,t1_fdmevx0,1578554619.0,"After reading all the replies to my original comment, it saddens me that many women share these experiences and that it isn’t at all uncommon. 

My speculation as to why guys act like this is because they feel entitled as if women are objects. Very toxic way of thinking. Mix that with desperation and/or bad upbringing from parents not really teaching them boundaries with the opposite gender and you get a bunch of women who have to live with the burden of having to overlook their shoulders. 

I think more and more powerful, smart, classy and influential women are hitting the media nowadays and are given a platform to freely express their views and ideas and I think it’s a great thing. The media has been too male-centric, whether it be movies, news, or just pop culture in general but I feel the tides are changing as the years go by. Guys also don’t have the luxury of peering into the lenses of strong, independent women who have a lot of media presence because again, the media is very male-centric. I predict men with power will undoubtedly be against this because it’s against the status quo but I like seeing strong women in the media because it’s refreshing from all the male drivel out there."
offmychest,fdmkjdc,t1_fdlxvx3,1578553342.0,"Yeah I think most reasonable people do think like this. Sucks to hear what women have to go through from reading the comments though, hopefully you do end up finding a guy (or gal) who reciprocates what you just said."
offmychest,fdlvq3u,t1_fdlufmj,1578533633.0,"Thanks for your perspective. I didn’t consider all women regardless of looks all get harassed too, pretty naive of me to assume only attractive women do. Now I know"

offmychest,fdlsrhk,t1_fdlmxep,1578531623.0,"I’m actually genuinely curious so don’t take this as a troll attempt. Hypothetically, would you trade being attractive (I’m just going to assume you’re at least above average in the looks department because of your story) and be conventionally ugly to be free from the attention of men? 

I’m not a woman so I’m not going to pretend I know the whole dynamic but I get unpleasant encounters with woman from time to time, mostly in a club or college party scenario where spaces are cramped and girls feel they can get away with grabbing my crotch and running off  but when I look at the entirety of the situation yes it is definitely pretty obnoxious for a repulsive, drunk girl who has no concept of personal space rub her sweaty behind on me but at the same time... I wouldn’t personally trade it to become a conventionally ugly guy so no girl would do these things to me. As much as I don’t like it when girls (I have no attraction to) do this to me, I’m sure somewhere in the far reaches of my brain, there is some tiny hit of dopamine that subconsciously strokes my ego whenever this happens and I’d take the benefits of whatever genetic lottery I won and accept some girls are weird

Also, I’ll point out that I’m quite aware that women have it potentially much, much worse than I do... but it’s a thought I have from time to time. Can’t have my cake and eat it too. Of course it would be best if everyone in the world was a chill person who respected personal space and what have you, but yeah. Hopefully I don’t come off as insensitive because I compared my situation to yours."

Rotations seem sharper and game etiquette is good (buffs are given to me if I deserve it 100% of the time, whereas during peak hours I could be 6-0 and not get a single red or blue buff). Generally better gameplay I find at these hours. (gold 1 s9 but playing ranked seriously in preseason got me to ranked solo queues with platinum1/diamond4 mmr players and I’m quite happy that my mmr gains will translate well into next season qualifier games) 

I’m sort of a ritualistic person and if something works, I usually stick with it and maybe there’s no objective science  or stats to backup my “2am-6am has best game quality” claim but it works for me and I enjoy it and I enter an insane flow state at these times I noticed whether it’s League or if I have to finish my last assignment or essay due soon. I pick one or two days of the week where I have zero obligations from work or school where I reserve a block of time from 2am-6am to grind solo queue. I generally don’t play this game nowadays (ranked) outside of these blocks unless it’s with really close friends in norms or arams because I ONLY find this game fun or enjoyable when everyone (including the enemy team) is fully tryharding and show good game etiquette. 

It’s my guilty pleasure and this is how I enjoy League of Legends."
