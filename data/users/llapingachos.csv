The problem is that the higher levels of amateur competition and player development are locked behind entities with the imprimatur of US Soccer. 

The most profitable model is to draw talent from private club teams and then enroll those players in  development academies that have relationships with top collegiate programs. There's also the legal controversy regarding the monopoly of Major League Soccer and its profitable marketing arm's relationship with US Soccer, a challenge brought by MLS competitor the North American Soccer League. This cozy relationship also leads to top US talent being walled off from playing in more competitive foreign pro leagues.

Id guess that the roots of this started in the 1970s, when people first started to make money off youth sports. I think an investigation of the leadership of that era would shed some light on how things ended up this way.

Id be interested in a comparison of the US system with England, whose team has reclaimed its prestige, and Scotland, who seems to have a similar problem with player development at the youth level."

NewJerseyuncensored,fcq5uqu,t1_fcl7ndi,1577879388.0,"Sometimes the synagogue vandalism is legit, here in Jersey in November there was a young man arrested with a machete at the Menlo Park Mall, he was found to have been previously coordinating online with self-styled Neo-Nazis responsible for two synagogues vandalized in Michigan and Wisconsin.

I remember when a young intern with the Christine Quinn campaign (they met the at the pride parade, LOL) was arrested to vandalizing a synagogue in Prospect Heights. Of course, this was only one week after 11 people were shot in a synagogue in Pittsburgh. There was also a massive wave of bomb threats around that time, well into the hundreds. Can't really call those hoaxes but they turned out mostly to be from an autistic 19 year old American-Israeli, the rest of them were from some journalist trying to pin them on his ex.

You could say that the media is the main participant in these event, or at least in giving them their political dimension. Seems like most of the hoaxters are mainly interested in attention or sympathy. Theres also a subset of true believers, usually activists who feel like they're losing. Lots of the hoaxes immediately after the election seem to fit that. Ashley Todd might fit into this category as well, she was the college student and McCain/Palin campaign who made up a story about a black man carving a B for Barack into her face on the verge of the 2008 election.
