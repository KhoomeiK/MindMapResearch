60daysin,ffn7led,t1_ffgr2i3,1580062845.0,"Usually, when something happens like, 'Are you seeing this crap?', most people will look at the person they feel closest to in that situation.  It's instinctual. If you watch other seasons of the show, the participants in jail will often exchange a quick glance during fights or tense situations.  Or if they are alone, they glance up at the cameras.

So Ashley looked at the cameras, because she feels closest to the people behind the cameras.  And she not only looked, she interacted with the camera.  

Those women inmates aren't highly educated, but they are more intelligent than Ashley, and picked up on that tell."
