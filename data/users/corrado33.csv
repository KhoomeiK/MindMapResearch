> It’s only heavy point loads that would need any special consideration.

What's considered heavy enough to need special consideration? (For traditional residential wood buildings.) Large fishtank? Fireplace? Pool table? Baby Grand Piano? Huge Gun Safe? (I'm ignoring things usually placed on the slab in the basement.) What about large bathtubs? I'd imagine those would be really heavy when filled with water.

> Strength-to-height ratio of 2x members is NOT linear. Strength generally increases with the square of depth, but it is complicated because of buckling and other stability considerations. Length, width, height and rotation constraints need to be considered for each beam.

I expected as much. Definitely not linear at least. And the ""taller"" the wood beam the more likely it is to buckle/twist. I would imagine the overall strength of a 2x member is defined by a nice little combination of terms with everything from length/width/depth, hanger type, wood type, etc.

> The reason why someone hasn’t written a program that calculates dead loads yet is because, for practicing structural engineers, it wouldn’t save much labor time, and there isn’t a big enough market for it

Yeah, that was my assumption. For experienced structural engineers they wouldn't need such a program. Which is one of the reasons I got a bit upset with a few of the people here saying ""oh it's too hard and there are too many things to consider."" I mean, probably not if I had to guess. Sure, if you learn every single edge case from school, then yeah, probably a lot of things to consider. But for most GENERAL construction projects? I'd imagine the calculations are near identical for almost every residential home with SLIGHT variations depending on house/room size, customer requests, etc. And often times those variations aren't enough to justify moving up in size from say a 2x10 to a 2x12. I think the main experience of a good structural engineer would be knowing when to apply different products, like you mentioned above. Solid wood, engineered wood products, etc. to achieve the cheapest cost yet strong enough construction."

That's nuts. How on earth do new engineers find someone to apprentice with? I can't imagine experienced engineers are happy go lucky to have their future replacements following their every move. 

Sorry, off topic. 

Yeah, I figured that anything I'd design would be overdesigned, and it'd be up to any future engineer to tell me ""no, you don't need this, it's overkill (or overengineered shall we say?)"". My point was that I'd rather overengineer something in the planning stage so that when it gets time to actually get certified by an actual engineer I'll know it's at LEAST possible, even if improbable. 

In all honesty, in this instance, I just wanted to know if I could get away with one beam and one post in a fairly large basement because I wanted to know if the space would make a viable workshop for cars... and poles make it hard to pull cars in and out. After reading all of the suggestions and responses here, I don't think 1 pole/post would do it, therefore it may be reasonable to use 2 much shorter beams in the opposite direction with a single post each. I'd GUESS that would reduce costs as... in my very limited experience, I'd be able to spec in lower duty joists and lower duty beams instead of one MASSIVE beam with very large 2x12+ joists. Actually I wonder if there are codes dictating if a basement can be used as a garage... I'm sure it'd have to be lined with fireproof.... drywall?? maybe blocks in the framing as well?

Hmmm, this is fun. I'd love to write a program to do this, but I don't know nearly enough to do it. Plus incorporating prices would be annoying even if I parsed a website somewhere."

StructuralEngineering,ff2kbuz,t1_ff1oyyy,1579510085.0,"Thank you. I'm well familiar with free body diagrams. I loved my physics classes!

However, I'm assuming you made your cabinet example simplified. Do the cabinets not also exhibit a force at the top of the wall pulling perpendicular to the face to the wall which would exhibit a torque on the wall? (Aka the wall would topple over if you only installed top cabinets and loaded them with heavy stuff if it were not properly supported.) I'd imagine that'd have to be accounted for, although I'm unsure if it's large enough to matter. I think it should... cabinets are damn heavy, especially when loaded with lots of plates and glasses and what not. I could easily see them deforming a normal interior wall if they were heavy enough and the wall was long and unsupported enough enough. Then again, top kitchen cabinets aren't that deep, likely for that reason. And I'm rambling. 

Interesting. I always knew that I could just do the math and figure out which weight goes where, and obviously a weight placed 1/3 of the way across a joist supported by a wall and a beam would be supported unequally by the wall and the beam, and yes, obviously those calculations can be done, I just wasn't sure if they WERE done. I guess my question was ""is there a general assumption that all weight 3/5ths (or whatever) of the joist's length away from the beam should be assumed to be supported solely by that beam."" That way when you do the calculation, you're accounting for stuff in the center of the beam twice, once for the wall, and once for the beam. But that'd probably end up with an over engineered floor/beam/wall I suppose. Better off to just do the math. 

Anyway, thanks!"

Humans are just, of course, concerned with maintaining the status quo. because we don't like change. The earth, however, will go on to change with or without us. We can't ""kill"" the earth. 

It's also worth noting that we are at a predicted high point in terms of CO2 concentrations, solar radiation, etc. etc. etc. Again, humans are definitely accelerating things, there's no denying that. 

The point is, global temperatures are a lot more complicated than ""CO2 concentration."" Most of it has to do with orbital effects and the solar cycle. More so the former, less so the latter (because orbital effects are more pronounced and have longer cycles where as the sun cycles every 11 years IIRC.)

The BEST drivetrain for winter riding is an internal hub like a nexus 8. Those will never gum up and never be affected by the snow. However, one has to learn how to shift and treat them correctly if you want them to last a really long time. (Unlike a derailleur, you have to STOP pedaling when you shift an internal gear hub.... or at least significantly reduce pressure on the pedals.... but it's easier just to tell people to stop pedaling.)

If they spin in both directions with no clicking or resistance, then this is 100% the problem. 

Unfortunately, it's not easy to fix. We would usually take the freewheel off of the back wheel, then soak it in a degreaser or try to spray as much WD-40 inside of the cracks as possible (on the front and back, not around the teeth.) And yes, we're using WD-40 as intented here, as a degreaser and water displacer. Get enough in there and the WD-40 will get rid of all of the gunk. Let it dry (or force it to dry with some hot air), and then drip some light oil in there, and it should be as good as new. 

Given your description, this is exactly what is going on. 

The other way to ""fix"" it would be to buy a new freewheel. They're cheap and can be replaced in a minute or two with the right tools. Most shops will do it for free for you if you bring it in. You do, however, NEED the correct tools as they're impossible to remove otherwise.

The same could be said for newer bikes with a freehub, but I've seen it less often, and GENERALLY we'd just throw the freehub away and install a new one (also requires special tools.) (Because freehubs are nearly impossible to rebuild and they're also cheap to replace.)"

That's not true, and you all know it. 

High numbers (dark pink colors) mean that the average wealth of a country's people is being skewed by a large number of rich people, or a small number of SUPER rich people (more likely.) Considering HOW MUCH a rich person has to make to skew the data, it's really quite disturbing that the US has a value of what... 5-7ish? 

Basically, there are a very small number of super rich people that is making it seem like the poor people in the country make more money than they do by skewing the average. Remember the ""curve setter"" in school who always got the perfect grade and made everyone else's grade worse? Same situation here.

Oh, also

* Mean = average
* Median = most common value

So if we have a set of numbers 1,1,2,3,4,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,200, the mean (average) is all of the numbers added together and divided by the total number of numbers, so 257/14 = 18.4. The median, however, is 6, because 6 is the most common number in the set. So obviously, if we have a small number of VERY HIGH numbers in the set, it will make the mean (average) seem much higher than it should seem.

EDIT: In the above example, the ratio would be 18.4 / 6 or ~3. Which shows you the unequal distribution of wealth needed to get such a high value of what the US has.

EDIT2: It's worth noting, this ratio is NOT the ratio of how much wealth a rich person has compared to an average person. It's the ratio of how much the AVERAGE is raised by super rich people. Considering the AVERAGE of some of these countries is 6 TIMES what the median is, there really.... REALLY are some VERY... VERY rich people in the country."

technology,fdja73a,t1_fdirek2,1578462995.0,"When you uninstall programs (from the control panel or otherwise) it just deletes the reference, as does literally every other way of deleting files or uninstalling programs that comes with windows. The only way your going to delete the actual ""data"" is by overwriting that spot in the disk with other data, which is exactly what most of those secure erase programs do. At least the legitimate ones that is. There is no way (that I know of) to purposely remove the actual data (not just the reference) from the disk in windows without literally filling the disk with a bunch of random data (or using one of those programs.)

Macs (apple computers) on the other hand, HAD a convenient ""secure erase"" function when emptying the trash that did exactly this, however it was removed with more recent versions of MacOS.

Also, apologies for not mentioning this earlier, but more modern drives (SSDs) and the like, do not like files to be erased in this manner unless absolutely necessary. This is because of the limited read/write lifespan of each ""parking space."" You won't... necessarily, hurt anything by doing it, but if you do it too often you'll hurt the lifespan of the drive. Also, modern SSDs will write their data in an ""ever rotating"" fashion. So say you filled up the left side of the ""parking lot"" with data so the parking lot was half full, but then erased half of that data. Old hard drives would then put new data right next to the data you had left, reusing the left side of the parking lot. However, if you can imagine, this would be detrimental to a ""parking space"" that can only be used a certain number of times (like on SSDs). So SSDs do things a bit differently. After deleting that data, the SSD would then fill up the RIGHT side of the parking lot with data before going back to rewrite the half of the left side you erased. While you may imagine that this means the ""data"" sticks around on the disk longer until it gets rewritten, it's impossible to make that comparison with a HDD. For an SSD that's used very often with data that's written and then erased, it won't be true. If the data was written to a spot near the ""end"" of a HDD, it also won't be true. However, if the opposite of either of those are the case, then it would be true. 

It's worth noting that modern SSDs have EXTREMELY long lifespans, even with their ""limited use"" parking spots. Long enough that for almost all normal users, they'll never reach the physical ""old age"" for the SSD before they actually get rid of the computer. (This is also why you NEVER buy used SSDs.... actually, just never buy used storage media in general.)

A cheap and easy way to be *relatively* safe when deleting a file if you want to make sure the data on the disk is deleted and not just the reference is to simply copy a bunch of large files to the disk after deleting it.

technology,fdeewrd,t1_fddybk2,1578337529.0,"Ok so let's do it this way.

Imagine it this way. Your hard drive is a MASSIVE parking lot. Cars represent little pieces of data. At the entrance to the parking lot is the little parking lot attendant, and he marks down which parking space EVERY SINGLE car occupies. So when someone comes back looking for their car, he goes ""It's in sector 3, row 18.""

When you delete a file using the recycling bin, all it does is erase the parking lot attendant's ""entry"" for that ""car."" So if you would go looking for that piece of data now, he'd say ""no such data exists."" However, this goes for EVERYTHING, viruses, malware, pictures, whatever. A program cannot run after it's been successfully deleted because the computer does not know that it is there. The computer can't ""see"" data after it's been erased. You've literally taken away the only thing the computer used to know that the file was in that place. So while... technically, the data is still there (the car is still in that parking lot), the computer doesn't know it, and therefore can't do anything with it. Special programs can go into the parking lot and manually say ""oh here's the data"", but windows cannot, by itself, do that. Now, it's worth noting that there is a TON of random data (cars) inside the parking lot that windows doesn't know exists. So it's really no big deal. And in fact, for modern drives (SSDs and the like), there are a limited number of times a parking space can be changed from having a car to not having a car, so it's actually beneficial to NOT change the parking space until it's needed for different data. When different data is needed, the car in the parking space will be changed to suit the data that now occupies that space. (Remember, it's really just 1s and 0s, so no individual car matters, it's the ordering of cars that matter.)

Now, related to viruses and malware. No, they can't run after you SUCCESSFULLY delete them. Unfortunately, lots of malware have built in protection mechanisms to prevent you from deleting them. They'll often copy themselves to memory or other locations on your disk that you're likely not to find. Therefore, yes, it IS possible for a piece of malware to run after you THINK you've deleted it. But not because it's running from that place on the hard drive, but likely because it's running from somewhere else that you haven't deleted. Some particularly nasty malware can even copy itself to the master boot record of the disk (the place where all your file locations are) and those are QUITE DIFFICULT to get rid of. Well, you basically just have to format the entire disk. 

In conclusion, it's impossible for me to tell if a piece of malware can still run after you delete it, because I don't know what kind of malware it is. If it's a normal exe with no ""deletion"" protection, then you should be fine just deleting it. But honestly just download an antivirus and antimalware program and run that. You should be fine. It'll delete anything it sees that's possibly malware, even hidden bits."

As for connecting it to an ""old"" ipad, you may want to check if that's even possible. Here's a link.

https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-connect-usb-devices-to-ipad-1999862

Honestly the size of the drive (portable or desktop) doesn't matter. So long as it connects via a plug that your ipad supports (normal USB-3 or USB-C) it should work. Most hard drives nowadays still use USB-3, but some do offer USB-C, so make sure you buy one that has the right connection. 

As for finding a drive that's a good price, just go to amazon and type in WD external 1TB drive. Looks like 1 TB portable drives are ~$50, 2 TB drives are ~$60-70. Of course, you could replace the ""WD"" with some other brand, but WD is known to be good so it's a good bet. Whatever you do, don't buy some off brand chinese drive because your data is too important to trust with possibly secondhand drives.

For the record, it's MUCH easier to transfer files off of an ipad using wifi or bluetooth, THEN copying them over to a hard drive from your computer.

gh = Θ A (xs - x)

where gh = amount of water evaporated per hour, A = the surface area of the water exposed, Θ is a constant (just pretend it is, it's not useful to discuss here.) And xs and x are the max humidity and current humidity respectively.

https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/evaporation-water-surface-d_690.html

However, as the energy of the light decreases (and the wavelength therefore increases), the reflectivity of most common mirror materials (silver, copper, aluminum) is quite good, approaching 95 -98%. 

Here is a reflectivity curve of a couple different metals.

https://www.layertec.de/files/capabilities/coatings/metallic/several-metals.png

It's worth noting that mirrors are also rated for certain power. You can't just point a high power laser at any mirror and expect it not to burn a hole in it.

As for a perfect reflector. Not in real life. Almost nothing in physics is ""perfect"" or ""100%.""

EDIT: As for why high energy photons are harder to reflect? It's pretty simple actually. High energy photons can more easily react with the atoms on the surface of the mirror, typically degrading it, because they... well... have more energy to work with. It's like if you throw a billiards ball and a wiffle ball at a window. They're pretty much the same size (ish), but the billiards ball (with much more energy due to its increased mass (assuming thrown at the same velocity)) is more likely to break the glass instead of bounce off. Same with high energy photons. More interestingly, some materials can be completely transparent to some photons, but opaque to others, which can lead to fun things if you know what to do with them. So while something may LOOK solid and non reflective to us, it may, in fact, act as a good mirror or window for photons outside of our own vision range.

EDIT2: Also worth noting the difference between the energy of a photon and the power of the source. Photon energy is essentially the wavelength/frequency of the photon. This can more easily degrade mirrors/etc. because of their high energy can be used to overcome more reaction's activation energy (aka push it over the hill.) However, high power light sources (like a high power laser) will degrade a mirror differently. Because a high power source will output TONS AND TONS of photons, it will literally heat up a mirror and cause it to degrade thermally (and/or melt a hole through it depending on what it's made of.) This is because even though the possibly lower energy photons don't react with the surface of the mirror as often as the high energy photons, there are just SO MANY of them that the reactions happen more often than a lower power, high energy photon source. (And many reactions end with the energy being lost as ""heat"" to the mirror itself, hence why it heats up.) High energy = high internal energy. High power = TONS of photons (but not necessarily high energy photons.) A source can be both high energy and high power, but typically it's harder to make lots of high energy photons than it is to make lots of lower energy photons. Meaning that high power CO2 lasers (IR wavelengths) are much more common than high power UV lasers. However, the latter (assuming equal power) is much more dangerous because of the additional reactions activated by the higher energy photons. (both IR and UV lasers are invisible to our eye, so both are equally dangerous in that respect.) With that said, I'm pretty sure that the most powerful lasers are often IR lasers."

You can be happy when you're poor, and you can be miserable when you're rich. But the things that a poor and rich person are miserable about are generally not the same.

A rich person is miserable because they cannot, oh I don't freaking know... uh... their new mercedes has to be in the shop for a few days so they have to drive a shitty loaner instead?

Blond hair only accounts for 5% of white people in the US, where as blue eyes is only 1-2% of all white people... so you're looking at a fairly small genepool there, and most of them come from a certain region of the world known for blond haired blue eyed individuals, so you're not wrong when you say they look similar.... now if you would have said ""brown haired brown eyed white people...."" haha. )"

By the time I have to cool it I have already progressed to the phase where I'm liquid cooling my entire base."
