read about the crusades. read about how kings used religion to control the peasants.  white people used religion as a way or as a pity excuse to convince themselves and more so to convince the blacks that this was all part of a divine plan.  

use common sense and understand that and you will see what it's like.  

read about the history of the christians and what they did to others that stood in their way.
