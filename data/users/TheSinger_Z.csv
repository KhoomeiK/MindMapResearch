WritingPrompts,ffjr0j0,t3_etubvt,1580004695.0,"Mr. Sanders wiped down the display counter and whistled a cheery tune.
Considering all the things he saw at his job, he shouldn’t be as happy as he was, but he was used to it.
All of the memories and pain filled relics he kept on display didn’t bring him down anymore, like they used to. He had been hardened in emotion, immune to it.
The bell above the door chimed, signalling the presence of a customer. More likely a seller. 

“Hello sir, how may I help you today? A memory removal, I’m assuming.” Mr. Sanders grinned at the teenaged boy standing in front of him.
The boy had wavy, chestnut coloured hair, and was tall and lanky. His hair was unkempt and pointy, and his skin pale.
“Uh, hi.” He fidgeted with a leather bracelet on his right wrist.
“What can I assist you with today?” Mr. Sanders politely asked again. “Do you have a memory or item to sell?” 
“I’m here to purchase something.” 
Mr. Sanders nearly fainted. In all of his 50 odd years running this business, not a single person has came to buy anything.
“I beg your pardon?” 
“I would like to buy this.” He held out a photograph of a white gold ring, with a lavender stone in the middle. “I was told you’d have it.” 
Mr. Sanders knew that ring. Around fifteen years ago, a man that looked similar to the boy brought it in. The man’s aura was damp, and gloomy, his face looked as if it had aged years beyond his true age.
“I-I do. One minute please.” 
Mr. Sanders walked into the back room and searched through the jewelry box. He found this ring in a small velvet bag. He winced as he touched it.
One of the side effects of the sold items and memories were if you were to touch it, you were to experience the pain of the previous owner. The only way to get rid of the pain, was to give it to a relative of the previous owner. Maybe that’s why nothing ever sold.
A white hot pain seared in his head, and his ears filled with a screeching noise.
“For bloody sakes!” He groaned and picked the bag up a second time with a pair of work gloves on.
The boy hadn’t moved from his spot when Mr. Sanders returned.
“See here boy, if you touch it, it’ll hurt you. Unless you are related to the owner of course.” Mr. Sanders warned as he slid the bag across the table.
“It was my moms wedding ring. She died in a car accident when I was a year old. My dad never talks about her, but I tracked it here.” He said as he stuffed it into his pocket.
“I only have $42 bucks...” he admitted as he pulled out a leather wallet. He held out a few crumpled bills.
“It’s okay son. Keep it.” Mr. Sanders said with a sad smile. For this first time in his entire working life, Mr. Sanders had a happy memory from his work."
