According to Chris Dickman, a professor of ecology at the University of Sydney, the amount of killed animals likely exceeds 1'000'000'000. 

I'm just gonna put that into perspective:

• That's 336'000 more than People who died during 911.

•Approximately 25 as much as in WW1

•Around 12.5 times the amount of People killed during WW2"
