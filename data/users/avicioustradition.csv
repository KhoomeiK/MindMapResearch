creepyPMs,ff6r952,t1_ff6pddj,1579633211.0,"It's an accurate description of what this dude wanted which was to pressure someone else into sexual roleplay. I'm not going to touch the rest of whatever this long-ass reply is because it's clear that you're invested in Explaining your choices and whatever. That's on you.  You were still a child yourself and I'm glad you moved past it. However this dude was trying to drag someone else into his shit and outside of Reddit, pretending to be a child while an adult you’re calling ’daddy’ has sex with you is pretty out there--and that's why I explained what he was after. It’s not something that a lot of people run across outside of fetish circles. One question—-If it isn’t sexual then why is it a ‘kink?’"

Iamactuallyverybadass,ff6evsf,t1_ff68xz0,1579625685.0,"Ever seen one in person? They can do a lot of damage to a child. Quite possibly lethal amounts. Also, they're usually very shy. If it grabbed a child there's a decent chance it was rabid. If you let it go once you have hold of it and it is rabid it will go turn around and attack again. He did the right thing by not letting go until it was dead. It's unfortunate for the coyote but letting it go after it attacked a person was not an option. Even if it wasn't rabid. Coyotes are wild animals, if it sees small humans as prey what's to stop it from targeting a toddler next time? An infant? They'd be dead before their parents even knew what was happening. Here’s your proof. https://www.desertsun.com/story/life/home-garden/james-cornett/2014/08/23/james-cornett-coyotes-humans/14516033/. They are predators. Never ever forget that."

He's what's called a ’ Daddy Dom’ it's a fucked up subset of BDSM where people get off on pretending to rape children. That's why he was trying to call you ’little one ’ and the rest of the barf-worthy pet names. He wanted a sexual relationship, through pictures and dirty talk online--likely working up to meeting in person. It was why he opened with ” How old are you?”   He was making sure you were above 18.  He's a creep."

AmItheAsshole,fewjkkl,t1_fewimva,1579411931.0,"The medical staff have a reason to be there. They’re keeping mom and baby safe. MIL wanted to spectate. She served no role in the moment and in fact her presence as specifically forbidden by OP. This woman was literally in the pushing stage of giving birth. The baby was crowning. It is the most difficult, painful part of childbirth. This man was ARGUING WITH HER in that moment—causing a panic attack even though he knew his wife’s wishes. He knew how scared she was and he chose that moment to try force his mother getting her way. The nurse removed him because he was a problem and a disruption at a moment that CANNOT be allowed medically. His being there can’t come at the cost of the safety of his wife and child.  The nurse removed him because he was arguing at a critical time and wouldn’t stop.  This wasn’t OP’s mother, this was her in-law. A woman she in all honesty has no choice but to get along with but with whom she doesn’t have that type of relationship. I wouldn’t let my own siblings watch me give birth much less my mother in law. Do you know women often poo themselves whole pushing? That we can tear and tension makes tearing more likely? That fear can stall labor and cause damage to the baby? 

He has only himself to blame for the situation. His wife was mid-push when he decided to act like a dipshit and the nurse tossed his behind out with his mommy since he couldn’t control himself and act like he had a lick of good sense."
AmItheAsshole,fewfjiz,t3_eqhn1t,1579409751.0,ESH: she’s shit for lying but it was bad form to call her out like that in public when it could seriously damage her relationship.
AmItheAsshole,fewdtrb,t1_fetr26z,1579408923.0,That’s awful strange considering the fact that you told her your wishes. You told BOTH of them your wishes—-and they waited until you were vulnerable to try and force the situation into their favor. Your husband STILL doesn’t get that what he did was wrong.
AmItheAsshole,fewdezc,t1_fevvl2p,1579408743.0," Then it’s a good thing you weren’t arguing with your wife while she was giving birth—not just giving birth but in the process of pushing. He was trying to force his vulnerable wife, already terrified into allowing something she had already refuse because she couldn’t defend herself. He was trying to take advantage of her vulnerability to get his mom her way. He played himself so he has only himself to blame because the nurse was doing what was best for mom and baby."
AmItheAsshole,fewc9jr,t3_eqlbl1,1579408269.0,NTA:  he only has himself to blame. He was more concerned about arguing that his mom should see your vagina than he was being supportive when you were giving birth. Giving birth is not a democracy.
AmItheAsshole,fewbvn7,t1_fewarin,1579408111.0,"Just because someone wants to see your snizz is no reason you have to let them. Would YOU want a strange staring at your vagina during the most intimate, vulnerable moment of your life when you’re in serious pain, scared already and also fairly likely to shit yourself or tear during the process? He argued with her while she was giving birth. That’s a full shop no."

TiM’s are the Emperor and society is the court,some scam artist convinced them that they were wearing a marvelous new set of clothes( being a woman) even though they (The TiM’s)  can see with their own eyes that they aren’t . So now they’re(the Tim’s) are walking around naked as hell but nobody wants to say anything about it because it might be awkward and so the ( society)  court just plays along with the TiM’e delusion—-even though they can see for themselves that the emperor has no clothes on. They ooh and ahhhh and compliment anyway.

I didn’t have to imagine myself in the female role and gross myself out. I could enjoy the aesthetics without obligation.
GenderCritical,fedssg8,t3_enk6j9,1579019123.0,"Because IRL men lie. They pretend to be decent humans because they have social pressure to at least pretend they see women as equal human beings. They have jobs to go to, reputations to uphold, relationships to manage. IRL they play nice because it’s socially advantageous to do so. Online they show themselves for who they really are. This is the real them, the true face that they hide away in public.  They hate women as much as they lust after them.  Sometimes more. They despise us. They resent us and they’ll hurt us if they think they can get away with it and the sad truth is that most of them don’t think we’re actually people like they are. We’re just things.

Also, this dickbag is also now trying to make sure that if HE can’t walk her down that aisle, nobody else will either by bullying her uncle not to do it. Real stand up guy behavior, right?

I know I am, because I can almost taste the vulnerability you’re leaking with every word you write. 

Keep going, please, spend another few paragraphs telling me how none of what I said really matters or is accurate in the most obtuse, purple prose you can manage to come up with as a shield to make yourself seem like more of an intellectual than you actually are and hoping I don’t notice.

I do love it when people prove my point for me.   I’m not concerned with annihilating you, the world will do that for me. It already has. You feel it every single day when you reach out and nobody reaches back.

Because he’s an asshole and nobody wants to put up with his crap. Which is why his pathetic ass has to try and tear someone down to feel comfortable making an advance. 


Know what I think? I think that you sympathize with him because you’ve been him. You defend him and push your little ‘kindness’ theory because it’s been you trying anything and everything you can think of to get what you want from a woman and failing spectacularly at it and seeing this reminds you of your own fuckups in that arena. You don’t want her to confront this guy about his behavior because you dread being confronted about your own. You don’t want to think too hard about your own failure to achieve your relationship goals so it’s just easier to push the idea of not addressing the issue and putting the onus on HER to behave to a higher standard."

AmItheAsshole,fdhywhd,t1_fdg52y8,1578432682.0,Good. Why should his feelings matter when he never once considered hers? That’s why he’s mad. He’s not hurt he’s just embarrassed because of how it looks to other people. If that doesn’t show you what OP did was right then I don’t know what to say to you.
JUSTNOMIL,fdhyn0p,t1_fdhec3e,1578432546.0,This is inappropriate and I have reported you to the mod team.  We don’t attack OP or defend JustNo’s here.

GenderCritical,fdfa6nx,t3_ejyyxi,1578356907.0,How do you hate the patriarchy when you ARE the patriarchy?
AmItheAsshole,fdf2xhk,t1_fdf2452,1578352094.0,"Nope.  There is no ‘must’ talk to him. OP  has no obligation to talk to him whatsoever or to entertain him or associate with him in any fashion. He’s the man her mother is sleeping with. Nothing else. The man is a rude, bigoted, abusive jackass and guess what? He’s not OP’s family. You don’t get to treat people badly and then expect sunshine and roses and forgiveness when it’s Kodak moment time. Know who is OP’s family? Her uncle. Who is walking her down the aisle instead of the douche her mother had the bad taste to hook up with.  There is nothing to be gained by associating with toxic people. Zero. Nothing. Zilch. I don’t get how you think OP is obligated to be a good little doormat and pretend what he did never happens. He also hasn’t changed at all—OP said as much, she just got better about not taking what he says to heart and has avoided him as much as possible. Something she couldn’t do as a child when he was emotionally abusing her."
AmItheAsshole,fdf1lwj,t1_fdezl8h,1578351246.0,"Ah yes, because it’s OP’s job to comfort and placate the man who emotionally damaged her as a child when he was in a position of power over her.  Why would you want some asshole who treated you poorly to be part of your life and walk you down the aisle on your wedding day? Just because he’s banging her mom doesn’t mean he gets a pass to do whatever and OP just has to grin and bear it and let him have his fake hallmark moment."
AmItheAsshole,fdf1csn,t1_fdezrmf,1578351089.0,Why? Why talk to a man who abused her as a child? So he can yell at her? Galslight her? Try to convince her that she deserved how he treated her or that he’s a ‘better person’ now?  Nah. Why would you want someone who treated you like crap when he had the opportunity to walk you down the aisle at your wedding? That’s an honor and a privilege he did not earn.
AmItheAsshole,fdf12jx,t1_fdezu0c,1578350909.0,"Why would she want to? He treated her like shit and ruined her self esteem and emotionally abused her when she was vulnerable and couldn’t get away from him. I’m pretty sure never seeing him again would be awesome for OP.  Just because you’re fine with playing doormat in the name of Faaaaaaaaamily doesn’t mean other people are. When you abuse someone  there are consequences. These are his. You also suck for saying OP is tearing apart her family. She isn’t. Her stepfather and her enabler mother did that years ago, these are the consequences of the choices THEY made."
AmItheAsshole,fdf0mrn,t3_ekwwcq,1578350631.0,"NTA: fuck him and the horse he rode in on. When you mistreat someone and emotionally abuse them you don’t just get to pretend it never happened. He was a shitbird when you were helpless and he’s still a shitbird now—-he’s just mad that his actions have consequences.m—and your enabler mom isn’t much better herself.  “He’d never hurt ‘us!’”  He was already hurting you, she just meant he wouldn’t hurt HER but said ‘us’ because it sounded better."
relationships,fdedazr,t1_fdecues,1578336526.0,"Then GF can go do it and be single. Since that’s what single people do. Experiment, by all means but you don’t get a pass to be nasty and mess around on your partner just because you want some strange. Self identify all you want but this shit is something you do when you aren’t in a relationship. I know I for damn sure wouldn’t maintain a relationship with someone who wanted to be unfaithful."
relationships,fdecezp,t1_fdec3gl,1578335971.0,Ew. Who’d want to have a monogamous partner who was out getting dicked down by some strange dude? Nasty. If you’re already poly that’s one thing but in a long standing monogamous relationship that’s just cheating and it’s gross.
relationships,fdebxe6,t3_ekv2ut,1578335665.0,"Dude. If she wants to sleep with men and ‘experiment’ with semen she isn’t a lesbian. She’s bi, which is fine but I think the warning signs are pretty clear that she’s no longer interested in an exclusively lesbian relationship."
amiugly,fd6gkhd,t3_ejy71t,1578190674.0,No. You’re just a normal looking guy. Solid 7.
AmItheAsshole,fd6fsbh,t1_fcwi79e,1578190322.0,"Last I checked cousins weren’t parents but nice try. Your point isn’t as pointy as you seem to think. All they’re doing is demanding service from OP at a price THEY want to set and nope. Not happening. They can die mad about it and so can you. Also, you’d think it would make more sense for her NOT to waste her valuable time by taking care of someone else’s THREE KIDS for THREE DAYS for nothing for people who clearly don’t respect her and instead be making the money that gets her out of her parents house ASAP. I mean, I would t know since I started paying rent the day I turned 18 but then I expect adults to act like adults and no adults I know faff around and fail to see to their own childcare. There is zero obligation to subsidize someone else’s stupidity."
AmItheAsshole,fd6ezw1,t1_fcwi79e,1578189975.0,For three days on short notice caused by their own lazy carelessness?
