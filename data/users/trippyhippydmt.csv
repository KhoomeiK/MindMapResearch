I still have my janky homemade rope screen that I can put back in but I really like these so far because its helping keep the canopy a lot more level."
microgrowery,ffcdihp,t3_esvi8g,1579797115.0,"I'll start off with the details of my grow. These are both chocolate mint og from HSO. They're under a 300w COB and the temps/humidty in the tent is 78-82° and 25-30% with lights on. The humidity is a little low but its normal during the winter here and im hesitant to put a humidifier in the tent. They're in 7g fabric pots and the soil in each one is made up of the same things, just in different ratios because im trying to figure out what ratios work the best. They're a mix of coco coir, perlite, and homemade compost. The compost is made partly from past harvests roots, stems, and fan leaves. And mainly from timothy hay, meadow grass, guinea pig poop and impactions, leftover vegetables, dry food dust, and soiled hay. The plant on the left is the one struggling and its soil is 40% compost, 20% coco, 40% perlite. The one on the right is 50% compost, 30% perlite, and 20% coco. My goal is to switch over to 100% organic and this is more of just me experimenting a little with the soil before I go all out organic with the teas and living soil and all that. Currently im using gh flora trio nutes on the struggling plant and the one on the right just got its first dose of gh go box nutes on sunday. And I know using those nutes makes it technically not an organic grow anymore, I just wanted to see the difference in growth rate with organic vs my normal nute cycle without going all out this grow. I do plan on going all out organic on my next grow in april though.

I know its harder to see in the pictures but I noticed about 2 weeks ago the lower leaves on the plant on the left were yellowing and the tips were turning yellow/white/brown as well. The tips almost reminded me of nute burn. At first I just thought it was a nitrogen deficiency because these are just over a month old and hadn't been fed any nutes yet up about until 2 weeks ago. I wanted to see how long they could survive off just the compost for future reference and for when I use it as a top dressing during the next grow. But I fed it a teaspoon of each bottle of gh flora trio and cal mag followed by a teaspoon and a half the next week and it didnt seem to help much. It did seem to slow down the yellowing at the bottom but then today and yesterday I noticed the yellow random streaks along with the tips. My one guess was a ph issue because I havent been testing, just going off memory of what it normally is around this time and the stems are reddish/purple which I remember reading can be a sign of ph issues. But when I checked that it was around 6.7-6.8 which is a little high for me but its only a little above what I normally run them at which is 6.4-6.6. My only other guess was maybe the water isnt draining quick enough because right now it takes about 3 full days for my soil to get bone dry whenever I water it with just a gallon. That seems a little slow to me because normally my soil is dry from a gallon in 2 days and 2 gallons in 3 maybe 4 at max and with my humidity being low like it is I'd assume they'd be drinking more from their roots. Any help or advice is appreciated"
modernwarfare,ffbf41o,t1_ff9tqbt,1579762563.0,"I havent used the m4 since opening week when I got it max level. Its a good gun but theres actually a few other guns that are on its level if not better imo. The  fal with 3 round burst, ak, and scar all can compete and do really well with the right loadout. The ak and the scar are my personal favorites even though they have the most kick. But I can consistently outgun people with the scar no matter what they're using because it shreds once you learn how to handle the kick. As for the mp5 you're right there. The only gun I've found that can compete with it at close range is the mp7 and pp90 but both of them get beat at range"

modernwarfare,fem72z5,t1_fem2iyu,1579242094.0,"I understand that, I just went over some of the more extreme things I remembered reading. The dude said barely any of the entire sbmm system has been implemented but he believed they would either roll out the other features in sections during each major patch or hold onto it for the next call of duty. But either way we're stuck with it at least partially because they wouldnt have spent all that money and time developing and patenting all the game mechanics they did."
modernwarfare,fem20sb,t3_epve2l,1579237171.0,"There was a post on here awhile back by some programmer explaining how the new sbmm is supposed to work based on their patents they filed. He said he didnt believe the system was fully implemented yet but it essentially tracked your every last move. From how far you traveled in between kills, whenever you stop and for how long, how long you ADS for, how many shots you fire in gunfights, how you play with certain weapons and on certain maps. Its able to determine if you're camping and then it goes down to what type of gun you're using and if thats a logical playstyle and its supposed to match people with similar playstyles and gun skill levels together."

modernwarfare,fdkcxn2,t1_fdk140u,1578501231.0,Its actually not a bad map with hardpoint. In tdm and dom it blows but hardpoint I can generally get 30-40 kill games while rushing around. Worst map in cod history is easily downturn from mw3
pitbulls,fdh0ly2,t1_fdgldf3,1578412770.0,"Actually no, I dont use their poop in the compost bin because that compost is used for growing veggies for my guinea pigs. He just started doing this a few weeks ago when it first snowed and now he's doing it at least every other day. Our other pit blaze poops in the same spot everyday like clock work though"

AskReddit,fdef88o,t1_fddrt0x,1578337725.0,"I used to think this was a lazy attitude until my current job where I realized thats 100% right. I work a very physically demanding job and for the first year and a half I tried my ass off day in and out and was one of the top 3 workers everyday according to our numbers. I was moved up 3 times to different jobs all of which I would have been off my feet a good 3/4's of the day  by the assistant supervisor who actually cared about how hard people worked. But then everytime I was kicked back down by the supervisor because ""I was too good of a worker to lose from the floor"". So why the hell were we told to try our asses off everyday if we eventually wanted to move up if in the end we were just punished for it. The 3 people they gave those jobs after me were all butt buddies/drinking buddies with the supervisor who played on their phone all night, broke a ton of product, and were some of the laziest people in the warehouse. Now I just shoot for the bare minimum we need to hit and if I do any more then that cool and if not oh well. Im done killing my body for essentially no reason"

No one is actually watching those cameras, I worked there for a bit at nights and apparently its just a recording they play all day everyday to try to scare people from stealing"
todayilearned,fd9u8ln,t1_fd8mko4,1578238093.0,"The syrup does but the bottled and canned stuff is getting more and more expensive. I mean they're still making decent money but its not anywhere close to where is used to be, especially with smaller businesses. They just raised the price on chain stores by a decent bit and mom and pop shops by a shit ton because the entire company is switching over to this new ""more advanced"" system which cost them a pretty penny. In our area we're struggling to keep the mom and pop shops because the prices for them are maybe only 10% cheaper then what they can sell them for where it used to be 30-40%."

modernwarfare,fcxgm8t,t1_fcwqhub,1578062413.0,I used to only play dom up until this game and hardpoint saved this game for me as well. In dom I was lucky to get more then 10-15 kills and getting constantly frustrated by campers but in hardpoint I can consistently get 30-40 kills and if you run pointman you can rack up point streaks all day by just playing the objective
modernwarfare,fcxfufa,t1_fcxanfk,1578061837.0,"Back during mw3 times they did console bans and IP bans towards the middle of its life for the god mode players and the ones using the walking ac130 cheat. But once it started blowing up and everyone and anyone started using it because people were selling them for $10-$20, they stopped doing that and just started handing out couple day bans to everyone"

modernwarfare,fbzeeze,t1_fby80h1,1577243946.0,Back in mw3 you could shoot down a pave low with 2 clips of an acr if you had blind eye pro and you could take out an osprey gunner with 3. But not a lot of people ran blind eye pro back then unless they were running support or getting shit on by streaks
