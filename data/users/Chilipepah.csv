This one MC night we were standing up top of the slope leading to Golemagg and were replacing two slots. He got asked if he wanted to come and sure he did. We were horsing around on TS when he entered and got summoned to us. When he appeared, he just stood still and watched Golemagg for like 2 minutes. He then whispered me, ‚ÄùI‚Äôm scared‚Äù. 
Oh the wonders of seeing these things for the first time! Hail Inny, my gnome buddy!"
