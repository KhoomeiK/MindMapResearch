It‘s great, some discover that reality is wildly different from their idea of the job, or if you just know which field you want, but not the specific job, it can help you narrow it down. Most go for 2-4 trial weeks. Some more, some less, it‘s up to you.

It can, if you or your partner goes too hard/fast. Communicate, like, a lot. Even if it‘s ackward. Actually, escpecially if it‘s ackward. IMO, you and your partner should be intimate enough to speak openly about such matters. If you aren’t, chances are it’s a bad idea to have sex. Similar to the saying that if you aren’t mature enough to buy condoms, you aren’t mature enough to have sex. And use your brain/common sense. It should feel good/rewarding for BOTH. 

Also, if you feel you need to take it slow, then take it slow, ffs. It doesn‘t have to all happen at once. (Regardless of what your partner might be whining about.) Me and my first GF did it reaaaaaallllyyyy slow (like, streched over months of slowly getting further and further). When it actually happened, it was just otherworldly. (For me, I won’t speak for her. But she seemed to enjoy herself, as far as I could tell at the time) I don‘t think it would have been that good if I/we had rushed things. 

If you are a woman, the tearing of the hymen can sting a bit and bleed. But shouldn‘t last to long, like ripping a bandaid off. Also heard of some accounts were the women didn‘t feel a thing, either because the hymen broke on some other occasion, or because she was relaxed enough, or because they took their time. Varies for person to person, I guess."
hygiene,fdhvbmm,t3_elcvhd,1578430799.0,"It’s the only way to evacuate stuff between your teeth. Your brush can’t reach those places. Everytime I don‘t floss for a week or so, the stuff that comes out of those gaps has such a foul taste it reminds me why I do it regurarly.

Do it, even if its not everyday. Heck, once a month is better than never. But if you want the bleeding to stop, I’d aim for 2 times a week minimum (? Don’t quote me on that) Flossing is great for your gum. The bleeding will stop as soon as your gum regenerates. (Might take a week or two) Doing it daily is better for me to keep consistency (with some fuck-ups here and there).

Try different products, I cannot use some because some gaps are so tight I end up destroying the string when forcing it through. There‘s a whole bunch of them. Bunches and bunches.
Have a tryout and run with whatever works for you."

Talk to him. Pleeeaaase. It‘s going to be a bitch of a conversation, that‘s for sure. But both of you are going to be stronger after it, individually as well as a couple. 

Try to find solutions ~~together~~, instead of having two people playing a guessing game. You are a team, it‘s you both against the challenge, not you against him or vice versa. You have to learn, as a couple, how to make each other happy. Contrary to the clichee relationships, where everyone involved just naturally does everything perfectly, the real world tells another story. Making each other happy is learned, and sometimes hard to figure out.

Come up with different possible solutions, both of you. Talk about them. Try them out. Find what works and what doesn‘t. Allow the other to fuck it up sometimes, that‘s okay. As long as you honestly try, how can one blame you for misjudging something? Maybe you have to figure out for yourself what you want/need. Allow him to be a companion on that journey.

Step into the shower, clean your ass, and put some lube on/in it. Silicone last the longest and works great for me.
The lube will make sure everything slides out smoothly and without scraping your ass. If possible, rinse and reapply the lube after your bathroom session.
You also will be able to walk normally.

But what if you get something permanent? You really think they will have a stock of medicine to keep you alive for 40 years? Not only that, you are suggesting they have a stock sufficient for everybody, for every illness. 
And again, producing/obtaining more won‘t be doable on another planet for a long long time. Oxygen, water, food, shelter, mobility and material processing must be solved first (and those are each a bitch to solve in themselves) and there are arguably many other things on the list that come before advanced healthcare.
