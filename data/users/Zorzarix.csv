We do take pride in our English skill, and Dutch people love speaking English to test their skill and show off. Paradoxically the Dutch accent can be very strong though, where it seems to be less noticeable with Scandinavians. With older people this is the case even more so, because of lack of exposure when they were younger. Nowadays it's much easier to immerse ourselves in English. Neither the news on TV nor movies get dubbed. They use subtitles instead Irish pubs are run by actual Irish people and some commercials don't even get subtitles."

But in Scotland this doesn't seem to be the case. They can understand everyone who speaks English, but many non-native speakers struggle to get what they're saying, including me.

https://i.imgur.com/53bu2tu.png

I couldn't find a good example on Google maps so I had to draw it.

So basically when you come from the South and want to go west, you have to take an off ramp on the right and then cut across four lanes of traffic to get to your destination. Iirc the speed limit was 110 kph on this road, but it wasn't very busy. Also there was the occasional tractor driving on it.

Of course I understand a country like Ukraine doesn't have the funds to have a flyover for every exit, but sheltered European me from a country with some of the best roads in the world was surprised to say the least.

Edit: I may be remembering wrong, but I can't find any real examples that resemble my drawing. There are similar situations, but usually the off ramp is located a little further away from the intersection so you have to backtrack to get to your exit.
