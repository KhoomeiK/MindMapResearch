Genealogy,ffdypqi,t1_ffcxo1z,1579832244.0,Sweet. Thanks.
Genealogy,ffcxolo,t3_esrl6t,1579809425.0,"I am thankful for those original record custodians who search and provide copies of records not already digitized.

This week I aquired copies of two Petition for Naturalizations. One from Elk County, PA and one from Columbiana County, OH. So thanks to those staff members for getting me those copies."
Genealogy,ffcufum,t1_ffarebj,1579807485.0,"If he worked for the railroad, do you know if he has a retirement file? I was able to find one for my Great Grandfather and had a lot of good info about him, and his wife once she started filing for widow's pension. Helped me solve the mystery of where he was born (we knew the state, but he listed a specific city on his pension application).

There are indexes to the railroad retirement board files on Ancestry. From there you'd have to take the file number and order a copy from the National Archives field office in Atlanta."
Genealogy,ffcqtj7,t1_ffbaehh,1579805331.0,Can I ask what sort of search terms you used and what the process was to locate something like this? I would love to be able to find resources for my family beyond ancestry/familysearch.
Genealogy,ffcprub,t1_ffcmdzq,1579804636.0,I never thought about that. Thanks for the tip.
Genealogy,ffbndd2,t3_espr6r,1579774057.0,Most public libraries provide access to Ancestry via their account for free. The only downside (depending on your opinion) is that you can only access it from their computers. You can do the research there. Save images of records onto a thumb drive (free). As someone else mentioned you can build your tree on Ancestry for free. Just cite your sources in the notes section when you enter facts.
kansascity,ff8n1u5,t1_ff7tz7l,1579686746.0,Not much luck on my own yet. I did find out we have a local St. Andrew's Society that does Burn's Night and other Scotch Heritage events. I was looking at their membership.

GetMotivated,fe7ox2h,t1_fe5g0re,1578917500.0,"It's all about the choices we make. What's stopping this single mother from taking online or night classes to get an education, get a better job, so she's more able to provide for her three kids? All she has to do is find an hour or two a night to study. I'll agree that since she doesn't have a ton of time she can't take a full course load so at half time it'll take her a little longer to complete a degree (even less if she chooses a certification program), but a little longer is not never.

Then within a few years she'll have that completed. She can get the better job. She get's paid better and has more time for her kids. A small sacrifice in the short term for a better long term outcome vs. just continuing to scrape by."
GetMotivated,fe7no9b,t1_fe6qn64,1578917101.0,"I can agree with this. You have to make smart choices. Working in certain industries can lead to success more easily than others. As someone else said, investing in yourself with education and the like. You have to work hard and smart."
GetMotivated,fe7n85h,t1_fe5g7cf,1578916893.0,I know people that have worked three jobs while they go to school full time. There's time if you'll take it.
GetMotivated,fe7n5ph,t1_fe5d0hs,1578916857.0,"Hard work absolutely does lead to success. It's not going to happen overnight. And yes, sometimes things happen, but you have to keep working hard and not just give up. There's always a choice. There's always some move you can make. Sometimes people have to make temporary sacrifices."

GetMotivated,fdeoufq,t1_fdeonyb,1578343526.0,What request did I remove? If you're referring to my edit of my original post I was simply clarifying what information I was requesting.
HVAC,fdenutb,t1_fdemxaa,1578342949.0,"Awesome, thank you."
GetMotivated,fdemgow,t1_fdekssy,1578342128.0,\ <- I think you dropped this. Thanks for the link.

Edit: I don't care about the affair. Trump himself has admitted to sexual assualt and clearly that's not a disqualifier for office. I was asking more for proof of her hatred for America."
leanfire,fdehxuk,t3_ekwotq,1578339405.0,"Also 30 y/o. Also had a net worth well in the red when I ran the numbers at the end of Dec. The good news is you're here, and you're making the decision to improve. I wish you the best with your goal."
personalfinance,fcu3qsx,t3_eixs3g,1577971727.0,"I know most people would argue that it's a bad idea because you're losing out on the earnings that that money would generate. I have that option with my employer's 401K. Any loan taken out generally has an interest rate between 1.5 and 3% (depending on market conditions). A person could save money on interest by replacing the high interest debt with the lower interest 401K loan. You'd have to see if the auto loan interest saved would be greater than the compound interest lost in your retirement account. For an auto loan with an already low interest rate it's probably not worth it. For something like a credit card where you'd save a fortune in interest, maybe."
FinancialPlanning,fcmuyfj,t1_fc9zxs5,1577793493.0,"Not sure where OP got it, but that is common advice in Dave Ramsey circles. If you've got some savings built up (Dave recommends starting with $1,000) then pause savings and investing and really focus on getting debt free. Then you can resume savings until you have a fully funded emergency savings (3-6 months income). After that you can get back into investing."
povertyfinance,fch5s6l,t3_eh88y6,1577647543.0,But how much of that was from people spending money on things they don't need? I had overdraft fees and sometimes it's just because I was stupid about spending.
