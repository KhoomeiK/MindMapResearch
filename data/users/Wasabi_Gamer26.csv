Your families reasoning is completely bullshit and of course your cousin is a total asshole, if you have a diet like that you should ask to make sure it fits what you eat, she had to no right to freak out and throw a damn plate when she knew you tried to be nice and make her something already. Nobody has any right to freak out upon finding out they ate something against their diet unless it was fed to them intentionally."

She's not like Palpatine she is her own person, she's not Rey Palpatine as in the girl related to the sheev. She's just Rey Palpatine as in Rey Palpatine. Also as much as I still like to keep minor things from legends in my head canon you really should base an argument related to Disney canon with stuff from legends."

SequelMemes,ff46kqt,t1_ff418a8,1579556653.0,"Lyndon Johnson was in power for 6 years. Palpatine was for like 35. That's like someone in the UK not knowing the damn queen. His legacy is infamous and would be common knowledge to everyone who isn't a damn infant. Taking his name would be making something new out of it, taking a previously reviled name and making it so people have a different reaction to it. It would show that names don't matter and heroes can come from anything, not to mention doing away with star wars making it seem like everyone has to always be either a Yoda, skylwalker, or Palpatine to be of any significance"
