UnsentLetters,fcy4xs4,t3_ejfhq8,1578074858.0,I agree but I do I find happiness in a way from this.  Knowing I’m not alone.  Although I feel bad for the person writing the letter it does feel better knowing my situation isn’t done totally abnormal occurrence.

Blind,fcxxokr,t3_eese4i,1578071957.0,I tend to either keep my folded up under my chair or I keep it straight and tuck the bottom behind my ankle and rest the top by my shoulder.  For my non folding canes I keep them in corners or under tables.

ExNoContact,fcxvnlp,t3_ejdeqg,1578071189.0,"This happened to me also.  It stings but you get over it.  The initial few weeks are pretty hard though.  Just remember to take care of yourself and have some fun,"
ExNoContact,fcxq26l,t1_fcx39s4,1578068768.0,"I get it!  That mindset isn’t for everyone.  Generally, I don’t either.  Not the type to just leave.  For me, In this particular circumstance- it means that if I love someone, I can’t allow them to keep hurting me and although I love them I have to leave.  I can’t keep arguing with them.  I can’t keep letting us fall apart or keep trying when he’s already given up.  I need to leave and let him be happy.

Edited for grammar mistake."
