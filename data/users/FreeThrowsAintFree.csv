And how ‘effectively’ they have transitioned may affect whether some are attracted to them or not, and it depends on what they are doing or have done in order to transition, such as physical or hormonal alterations and what kind of clothing they wear, and to some degree it is just going to be in the eye of the beholder of their potential partners.

I view human sexuality, with regards to who is attracted to who, like this:

You can be attracted to one or multiple of the following:

Men, Trans Men, Women, Trans Women, or some combination of the four.

Just because you’re attracted to one, doesn’t necessarily mean you’re attracted to any of the others.  You may also ‘lean towards’ some more than others, if you’re attracted to more than one.

If you are dating someone, you deserve to know who exactly you’re dating.  Maybe not from minute one of the first date, but if not, then fairly early in the dating process, and certainly before sex.

If science reaches a point where someone can literally change their sex on a DNA level, completely transitioning, then I think at that point you shouldn’t have to say because there’s literally no difference at that point."

My reasoning is that you could argue that false accusations of rape could be legally interpreted as criminal confinement with a deadly weapon because to lie to the government about someone raping you will almost certainly result in the accused being forcibly arrested and put in a jail cell.

To do such a thing is to initiate force (by means of using the state and its legal power and its ability to use physical force, including up to a firearm, if the victim resists too much) on that victim (the falsely-accused) to at least temporarily confine them against their will in a jail cell or prison cell for a matter of hours, days, weeks, months, or even years.

If not that, at least leave him with that village for a while.  It’s too much, and even that little shit has ridiculous healing powers, too, and can already do quite a bit for a ‘baby’ who presumably never had any training.  It’s starting to feel like Baby Sue.

I 100% understand why he’s popular, and I don’t hate him, I just feel over-saturated with him, and he’s taking the show in a direction I don’t really care for.  I wanted to enjoy a SW show without the Force playing any significant role, or none at all, and see how ‘regular’ folks get along, or have conflicts, in that universe.

We started with that, but now it’s quickly become ‘jedi’ and the empire again....

The show has potential, and even with my gripes I’d say it’s a good show, but it’s frustrating, especially on the heels of the DT, to see yet another SW property become force powers and imperials, instead of what the title and premise suggested before the story kicked off.

In other words, I wanted The Mandalorian, not The Mandalorian Babysitter’s Club."
saltierthancrait,fdokhre,t3_emafbf,1578606972.0,"I think our best hope is the rise of smaller indie films that get better and more affordable visual effects as the years roll on, used by people with new universes and worlds to build and explore, rather than resuscitating old ones over and over again.

It’s already happening to a point, but imagine if those folks could approximate the visuals of a 2019 blockbuster movie by, say, 2025, or 2030?  Could open a lot of doors for smarter, more inspired fantasies and science fiction that look great.

I think Hollywood is mostly doomed, creatively-speaking.  And you know what, they exist to make money, the masses eat this cotton candy all year long, so who can blame them for milking that cow over and over again, really?  It’s profit first, art second with them."
saltierthancrait,fdnnced,t3_em7wnu,1578589376.0,"I look at it another way:  Organically, the story clearly still needed to revolve around Luke Skywalker.  But it was more important to them to push him (and the rest) to the side, to make way for pretty, young, new people, and the organic story punished them for this because nothing they could come up with as an alternative to Luke remaining the main protagonist really worked particularly well.

They ignored their storytelling instincts because their agenda took precedence over what was supposed to happen IMO.  If they had faith in 60-something characters being the leads, it could have been so much better IMO."
