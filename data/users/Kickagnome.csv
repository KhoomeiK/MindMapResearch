Dominos,ffw41pp,t1_ffvnw43,1580283391.0,Not always for me. I usually get 1 out of every 10 people that actually say they want it. Why they want it I’m unsure of since dominos emails you a copy of your purchase anyways. But I give it to them anyways.
television,ffsuz6r,t1_ffrem0f,1580193505.0,"I broke down and bought the episodes off of YouTube. Could have easily found them online, but wanted to support the show. Season 4 is really good."
electricvehicles,ffsjwir,t1_ffsjdtj,1580183519.0,"That’s not the point. I’m saying hybrids are a very good option for some people, and in many cases cheaper then a full EV. No reason to be smug. Technically you could probably do 20k in a Volt too on one tank of gas if you stayed below the 50 mile limit. It’s a very good Hybrid."
electricvehicles,ffsj278,t1_ffsi1xx,1580182911.0,"I had a friend drive a volt for well over a month, went 1500 miles before putting the gas in the tank since he drove less than 50 miles a day. A hybrid is a good option for those that don’t drive very much, but still like the option of going on long trips."
reverseanimalrescue,ffqwpqr,t1_ffq1cpq,1580145364.0,"Have you ever lived around deer? It’s hard to feel sorry for them with how insanely dumb they are. I’ve literally seen deer jump through oncoming traffic, and then turn and jump right back into that traffic splattering them all over the interstate. I’ve never in my life seen an animal that doesn’t have any type of critical thinking abilities like these guys. They could rescue this guy, and I wouldn’t be the least bit surprised if he jumped right back in the water"

Dominos,ffqv06o,t1_ffpzpil,1580144259.0,"The best course of action to take if at all possible is not to take any action. That's #1. Never escalate a dangerous situation. It's a hard lesson to learn from those who like to sling weapons around like they're toys, and consistently get the itch to use them whenever possible. But that's a mindset that will get you killed. Just because you have a weapon, doesn't mean you use it. Something police officers haven't learned yet either. Trying to blow someones head off over 20$ is a pretty insane mindset."
Dominos,ffpw68k,t1_ffow5l2,1580108079.0,"To be entirely fair, I don’t think anyone is robbing you with the intention of killing you. If you just give whatever you have to them, chances are pretty good you’ll be left alone. Carrying a weapon and attempting to engage them in a shootout just increases your chance of getting killed many times over."
Stargate,ffobt3f,t1_ffo9sm1,1580076016.0,"I disagree on Vala. I think they attempted to revive the humor from the show that was lost when Jack departed, but I felt it just didn’t work. She added a tone to the show I just didn’t enjoy."
todayilearned,ffo5cjf,t1_ffn6l5t,1580074356.0,I remember reading a couple studies that pointed out that underage girls in school tend to promote the most mean and ruthless bullying among classmates. The introduction of social media magnified this problem many times over.
startrek,ffmie4g,t1_ffmhij4,1580055151.0,It’s useless trying to talk about Janeway with people on here. Nobody is willing to use any amount of critical thinking to really look at her actions. You guys hold her next to Jesus.
startrek,ffmfr28,t1_ffmc7kb,1580054051.0,"Actually by her destroying the Borg conduit & Queen in Endgame, you could say that's an act of war with untold consequences. You don't think they would retaliate after that?

Also her changing the entire timeline and lives of possibly trillions of people all over the galaxy, all for crew of less than 200 people. That's the definition of an easy way out. Pretty fucking reckless and a disregard for all consequences.

This subreddit likes to think she can do no wrong, but you could easily argue she’s done a lot more horrible things in her time then any other captain. Tuvix being among those that would like a few words with you. Or how about that little girl you see in the first few moments of Endgame? Janeway erased her existence by altering her crews fate. But that’s okay right?"

Dominos,ffks21u,t1_ffkru08,1580027877.0,Oh we remember. We also remember the addresses of those that don’t tip. I remember those people well. No worse feeling then getting a customer that lives 6 miles away that you know doesn’t tip.
Dominos,ffkred9,t3_eu47kg,1580027554.0,"Listen man, if you tip 10$ you’re considered the holy grail of customers. I’ve worked at multiple stores and anyone who’s consistent like that is our favorite customer. We’ll remember you every time you order. I sometimes sneak those customers a 2liter and some ranch or garlic.

A ‘good tip’ is probably 3-4$, a bad tip is 1-2$. A great tip is 5$+

Around where I work the average tip is about 4-5$."

Apes vary by a lot, so it isn’t really fair to lump them into one group going off a few stories you’ve heard. Elephants will also attack people, but it’s super super rare."

sciencefiction,ffg5wws,t1_ff2cj3d,1579899142.0,I stopped trusting reviews and any type of claims about movies from so called ‘experts’ and popular websites. Must of that stuff you just can’t trust. I would watch the movie and find out they gave it a 10/10. And all I could think was they must have been paid off to give a garbage film such a high praise. It’s best to just go in blind or read reviews from actual people.

startrek,fffmf5n,t1_ffex4hk,1579887101.0,"In my opinion it’s the worst opening episode for all the series. It’s extremely hard to get through, like a lot of season one. But fortunately the series isn’t judged by season one."
startrek,fffm5w7,t1_fffjnkj,1579886944.0,"He wasn’t racist, but he certainly wasn’t quiet about voicing his opinion on people. Him and Spock had a fun bantering relationship through the years. As Janeway said, it was a different time in Star Fleet and they got away with doing and saying a lot more things."

startrek,ffblo1s,t1_ffbl6ca,1579771438.0,"How poetic would it be for Maddox to be the person that ends up remaking Data into a person. Maddox being the person that tried to destroy Data and spent his life trying to figure out how Data worked, ends up recreating him into a living person."
startrek,ffblije,t1_ffbl42x,1579771201.0,"Doesn’t it strike anyone as odd that he would keep that? He doesn’t particularly like children, and he really didn’t like the idea of a captains day.  Seems a bit out of character for him to have kept that for all this time. He never did strike me as a sentimental type of person at all during TNG."
Stargate,ffblbx3,t1_ffb52vm,1579770922.0,"Not to downplay how awesome Stargate is, but it’s nowhere near the caliber that Star Trek and Star Wars are. Certainly not strong enough to be a flag ship show for an entire streaming service."

dating_advice,ffbbror,t1_ffb5xyj,1579758836.0,"Hmm. I think the people downvoting you in this thread are overweight themselves, and don’t have their lives together like you.

dating_advice,ffbbj5x,t1_ffb47zl,1579758587.0,"You’re not a dick. These people are crazy and to be honest, they’re apart of the problem. You have every right to want to date someone you find attractive. Don’t lower your standards for these people because they think you’re being ‘shallow’. Being extremely overweight shows a lot of characteristics about a person that I personally don’t find attractive either. If I was to date someone, I want someone who’s motivated to be healthy and want to make positive changes in their life that reflects that."
dating_advice,ffbbbft,t1_ffb1i57,1579758358.0,How is not wanting to date someone who is overweight shallow? Being overweight shows a lot of characteristics up front to any potential person. And I’m sorry I don’t find excessive weight attractive. But that in no way makes a person shallow.

UnresolvedMysteries,ff6vpnf,t1_ff5t25i,1579635855.0,"Perhaps his family treated him poorly. We'll never know. Almost no details on this person. If he did choose to disappear that's really his own choice, and perhaps he just doesn't want to be found. There's nothing that says this was foul play, but just someone who didn't want to have contact with his family. If they believe he's **estranged** then there's a lot more they're not telling about the relationship between them."
Dominos,ff6g96k,t1_ff5y0qp,1579626540.0,That’s not true at all. If you become a good driver ( which is rare these days ) who closes or opens you can negotiate for a higher rate of pay pretty easily. I have. It’s up to you to speak up and let them know what you want. Saying nothing will always get you nothing.

I can't listen to anyone talk about the current shows without interjecting how it's not our 90's trek. Everyone should understand that the TV that produced your favorite Treks just doesn't exist in that format anymore, and it's never going back that way again. It's neither a bad thing or a good thing. It's just different now. You can decide for yourself though if you like the new stuff, but everyone should stop comparing it to the old. There's an entirely new audience that didn't exist when the old shows were produced, and that audience appreciates the format of television now. CBS is going to try and capture new faces because that's the future. The shows will definitely be less 'episode of the week' stories and focus more on one continuous story for an entire season, probably with heavy action. It's the way of things now."
