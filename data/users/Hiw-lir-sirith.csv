Bible,ffpitca,t3_euhx6s,1580096066.0,"I wouldn't say so, no. They are different types of writing serving different purposes, wisdom literature vs. personal letter. Paul is also a complex writer and his work is multifaceted. There may be sections that sound like Proverbs, but they emerge organically out the larger work he is developing.

If you want to understand Paul, you need to take him in context and study both the forest and the trees. For example, the break between Col. chapter 2 and chapter 3 is one of the worst artificial breaks in the whole Bible. It occurs right in the middle of his argument in which he creates a juxtaposition between rule-oriented and resurrection-oriented thinking, showing how the former is ultimately unable to free us from sin.

He is giving more than isolated proverbs. He is giving insights into human nature and showing how the gospel differs from just another system of overbearing rules, how it transcends the weaknesses of human nature and unlocks our ability to transform into godly beings."

KeeperoftheLostCities,ff9dsi5,t1_ff93mll,1579710822.0,"Quick correction on your terminology: 

KotLC is written in a 3rd person limited perspective. It's 3rd person because the narrator refers to her as another person, (""Sophie"" instead of ""I""), and limited because you are right that we are restricted to Sophie's POV. It's like we are a camera following her from behind, but we can also hear her thoughts.

Percy Jackson is written in the 1st person perspective, so the character himself is the narrator (""I"" instead of ""Percy"").

Both styles can be very effective when they are well written.

As to your questions:

1. I haven't the slightest idea.
2. I think Oralie genuinely loves Sophie, and that she's basically in hell right now with Sophie knowing and hating her. I expect after Sophie gets over the shock of finding out, and accepts that her problem with the matchmaking isn't going way, she will warm back up to Oralie and have a good relationship with her again."
KeeperoftheLostCities,ff7f04d,t1_ff79ppj,1579648024.0,"This is one of those moral questions that Messenger has clevery brought to the fore with Alvar's character. What is the right way to deal with someone on an evil path? Destroy them to remove any future threat, or leave room for redemption?

I think of all the great stories I've read that have explored the idea. My favorite is in *Ender's Game*, where Ender Wiggin gains a reputation for destroying his enemies so thoroughly that they are incapacitated beyond ever fighting again. That's Fitz's perspective. Kill the enemy when you have your chance, and remove the possibility that they will cause more damage. Yet even Ender changed throughout his story and developed into a man of deep empathy, as we see him in *Speaker for the Dead*. It was even his empathy that gave him such a power to destroy in the first place.

I think Fitz would have been justified in killing Alvar, but I don't think it would have been wise. The Neverseen didn't win the elves over to their side by revealing Luzia Vacker's secret treaty with the trolls. If Fitz had killed Alvar on the spot, the Neverseen may have become more sympathetic to everyone watching. That is the moral dimension of war. There is something powerful about an enemy owing you his life. That is an idea we saw play out in *The Lord of the Rings* with Gollum, and in *Harry Potter* with Peter Pettigrew. Fitz is still a hothead, which sometimes is exactly what you need in battle, but he also carries the risk of bad judgment.

I am hoping to see Fitz continue to mature. His righteous anger needs to be tempered by the influence of the team, and I think we've already seen it happening to some extent. I would love to see some kind of closure for Fitz in Alvar's story, something good that justifies leaving him alive, and something that softens Fitz's heart and his pure hatred for his brother. The trick is to leave a path open to the light for your enemy to find, without forgetting that you are also making yourself more vulnerable by doing so.

I think it should also be recognized that Fitz was the only person who understood the threat that Alvar posed in *Flashback*. He was right and everyone else was wrong, and I think he would have been justified in killing him when he had the chance. At the end of the day, Fitz might be the person the team needs most, someone who can make a hard decision like that in the heat of battle.

KeeperoftheLostCities,ff6zk1e,t1_ff6y70x,1579638121.0,"It's another similarity with the HP universe, where there was a stigma against muggle-borns. From the author's perspective, I think it is a way of revealing how arbitrary many of our own prejudices are. They make just as little sense, but it's harder for us to see because we are immersed in them. It is one of the great things that reading fiction can give us, an outside perspective on our own world.

It's also interesting that the Lost Cities appear perfect to us at the beginning, but their cultural and moral flaws are gradually revealed as we learn more. When the Council decides to put the ability restricter on Sophie, it gets to the point of being dystopian, but as the series moves on the Council starts to redeem itself and accepts Sophie and the Black Swan. They come back from an evil and foolish act and learn from their mistakes.

That storyline is amazing in its complexity and nuance; it constantly challenges the snap judgments we make about the characters. It is the kind of thing that makes me a better person as I read it, slower to judge and more willing to forgive."
KeeperoftheLostCities,ff6xvni,t1_ff6ve6n,1579637138.0,"I see her in a similar way as Harry Potter. They both had modest upbringings with humans and then were not only introduced to a new world and new powers very suddenly, but also discovered they were uniquely burdened with the identity of a savior in this new world, special even among the special. There could hardly be a more jarring change of circumstance.

I see Harry and Sophie both retaining their humility and desire for anonymity, while eventually accepting and embracing their roles as savior. The result is that we see them sometimes being genuinely humble, and other times self-absorbed. They can hardly avoid acting this way since the responsibilities on their shoulders are so heavy.

There was a brilliant moment in HP, at the end of Order of the Phoenix, where Voldemort even uses this against Harry, staging a trap that frames Harry as the only person that can save a hostage, which of course he believes. Hermione even calls Harry out, telling him he has a ""saving people thing,"" to persuade him not to act impulsively.

Sophie sees herself similarly, a kind of savior with a unique responsibility to face the enemy, often alone. She forgets people because she has succumbed to the identity of a hero, which makes her myopic. But at the same time, she is still humble and good, genuinely loves her friends, and consciously knows that she needs them. 

It's an internal struggle that makes her complex, and the reader sees contradictory things about her personality. She's one of my favorite characters of all time."

KeeperoftheLostCities,ff6fh3e,t1_ff6d2f6,1579626052.0,"I don't think Fitz has done anything that rises to the level of abuse.

Fitz, dealing with the tragedies of losing and almost losing family members, and struggling with circumstances that damage his family name, which he rightly values, has to manage his anger, and does so quite well repeatedly.

It is his natural reaction, not abusive in itself. We all have to learn how to handle stress and manage our flaws. He never does anything to hurt Sophie deliberately, but they do end up hurting each other in various ways. ""Abuse"" is a very serious charge that I think gets tossed about much too freely.

I do think Messenger deals with abuse clearly and boldly when it comes to Keefe's family. Keefe is a well written character and how he deals with the abuse is very complex and often inspiring."

KeeperoftheLostCities,fewwizq,t3_eqh5vv,1579420585.0,"Those are the critiques of a bystander who sees the whole field of events unfolding. This plot is really very well written, but you have put yourself in the characters' shoes to appreciate how the threat of the unknown affects their decision making. 

The Neverseen's greatest weapon is the fog of war. When things are happening around you that you don't understand, that undercut your most basic assumptions, the most natural reaction is to stop and regroup, to try to put the pieces together of your shattered expectations into a reality that makes sense again. It paralyzes you into inaction because every step forward looks like a trap.

That is how the councillors felt when they learned about Fintan, how the Vackers felt when they learned about Alvar, and of course how the whole of elvish civilization felt when Sophie was first kidnapped and after all of the public spectacles of destrucion they carried out.

We as the readers know that the Neverseen are small and vulnerable, but everytime they are clever enough to shake everyone's faith in what they thought was safe, in who they thought was loyal, the fog of war paralyzes them again.

This is actually a strong theme in Legacy, right from the opening sneak peek where Sophie is struggling to break through the cycle of being confounded and paralyzed. The Neverseen know that if they can be unpredictable enough, they will drop the fog of war on the battlefield and use it to damage a foe that is larger and more powerful than they are. These principles are straight out of the most important book on warfare ever written, The Art of War by Sun Tzu. I wouldn't be surprised if Messenger drew some of her ideas for the Neverseen for that book."
