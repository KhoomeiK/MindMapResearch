How do you lower people's demand of wool? Are there any alternatives that are ethically sourced, similarly priced, and don't impact the environment?

If you don't know how to address that then you don't have a solution."
facepalm,fgt2vf5,t1_fgt0fys,1581097902.0,"How do you propose we get the world's wool industry to agree and implement your first point?

Has there been any country that has stopped breeding sheep because of ethical reasons?"

I'll add it to the list."
facepalm,fgsymtk,t1_fgsx73k,1581095373.0,Does that book address realistic ways to end all human domestication without affecting any ecosystems and keeping up with global demand?
facepalm,fgsyaen,t1_fgsx73k,1581095164.0,"Homework? What? I was looking for a discussion but I see you're not interested in one. That book is a philosophy book, I don't need to read it to have an opinion on the matter. 

His book focused on animals who suffer. What does he mention about sheep? Sheep don't suffer when they get their wool sheared. 

Did his book make any mention of cats and dogs?"
facepalm,fgsws7h,t1_fgsve6d,1581094274.0,"You make it sound so easy. How would you propose that when there's dozens of countries exporting wool? Do they have a realistic alternative to switch to? 

And why would we stop breeding them? Other than wiping out a species, what would that accomplish? We provide safety in return for wool, which is a symbiotic relationship that benifits both species. Should all symbiotic relationships be frowned upon? Do we know for sure that wild sheep have a better quality of life than domesticated ones? Should we get rid of all cows, dogs, cats, as well, since those have been selectively bred too?"
facepalm,fgsuh9y,t1_fgsrqqf,1581092911.0,Well what can we do about it now? We have the sheep we see today thanks to thousands of years of selective breeding. It's not something we can simply reverse.

MadeMeSmile,ff71cda,t1_ff6xzoz,1579639165.0,"I wouldn't say we're all born equal. Some people have to face more challenges in life because of the hand they were dealt. So yes I'd be more sympathetic towards someone who struggled their whole life. Sounds like you disagree with that, and that's fine. The world needs both kinds of people.

And I agree, there's nothing wrong with certain criticism. Though it's very important to know when to give it or not. I used to play fortnite with him all the time and I never hesitated to call him out on his bad plays. Sure he got upset a couple times but so would any 11 year old.

If I was playing with someone who had poor coordination, weaker muscles, tremors (i.e. cerebral palsy) I wouldn't criticize his fortnite playing skills as much.

Edit: I guess you're someone who won't treat them differently, and I would (although I'd never admit it to them). Different approaches work for different people, so I don't think either of us are wrong."
MadeMeSmile,ff6xb6g,t1_ff6u8wl,1579636802.0,"Understandable. To be fair I'm not coming from an impartial place, my friends brother is autistic and seeing him upset is the saddest thing. He doesn't respond to criticism very well, then again he's only 11."

MadeMeSmile,ff6s4mx,t1_ff6mq3h,1579633739.0,"You do you. You can say what you want, and I'll respond how I want. No need to get upset. 

There's a difference between being treated normally, and being held to the same standards as someone without a disability, especially when your disability directly impacts your ability to perform to those standards. 

I think the saying ""if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all"" is very relevant here. But if you want to call the art bad, go for it! Do what your heart desires."
MadeMeSmile,ff6jkqc,t1_ff6avp0,1579628575.0,"Why say anything at all? Why did you feel the need to butt in and say the art is bad? What good does that do to anybody?

You can do whatever you want in your free time man, but if you choose to criticize a disabled person's art, I'm gonna call you a dick."

Everyone knows about Andrew too, people just don't want to talk about it as much, because it's upsetting and there's not much else to say. 

Idk how this shit gets upvotes"

If that Mosque shooting video became the most upvoted of all time in that sub, some sick individual will try to beat that with their own video. Even if there's only a tiny chance it could happen, we should do our part and not promote them. 

Less importantly, imagine the backlash reddit will get when the next shooter mentions they wanted to get to the front page of watchpeopledie. Nah. Best to remove those kinds of videos."
