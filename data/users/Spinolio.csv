One of the reasons public bathrooms end up being removed is that they turn into shooting galleries for IV drug users. 
  
Just to be clear, I don't hate the homeless. I do, however, recognize that there is a difference between people who are homeless because of misfortune/circumstances that are beyond their control who want to reintegrate into society, and those with untreated mental illness or drug addictions who have no interest in any living situation that requires them to live according to anyone else's rules. Because (at least in the US) it is impossible to force anyone into rehab or treatment for mental illness unless they are committing crimes or are adjudicated an immediate threat to themselves or others, no matter how much money and effort you pour into helping the homeless, there will always be a percentage of that population who cannot be helped - they can only be enabled. 
  
No McDonalds franchise owner or Starbucks manager is going to get too worked up about a street person who comes in, uses the restroom to relieve themselves, or even cleans themselves up using the restroom sink. What causes problems is when the hardcore homeless person trashes the bathroom, shoots up, or defecates/urinates in inappropriate places because they either are too high or too crazy to care.
  
Defensive measures like ""hostile architecture"" aren't inexpensive to implement, and they aren't being put in place because business and home owners hate the homeless as a matter of principle. They're always a response to a situation that has gone unaddressed for too long.
