C is barely sufficient, and D means you're coming in below expectations. 70 means you're barely satisfying the minimum. Grading games can be the same, but it means anything 6 or lower is lacking cohesion, or wasn't proofread and features issues that shouldn't exist in a release."

When you run up, turn left and be ready to block/dodge the greatarrow at your back. Afterward, you can run down behind the left archer on the buttress it's standing on, and the right archer won't be able to hit you. The slope of the buttress is enough that many of the archer knight's swings will miss you. Easy kill, take your time, be careful not to open a sight-line to the other archer.

Then, you can take the other archer on. Again, luring him to the buttress is recommended. This seems to be the only way that doesn't try to rush past them."

darksouls,ffxmeyf,t3_evq9z6,1580328089.0,"Summon Solaire, and let him draw the fight while you get yourself to a safe distance to engage with Ornstein.

Attack Ornstein while Solaire distracts Smough. Dodge Ornstein's attacks while backing away from Smough, but make your priority eliminating Ornstein as quickly as possible. The fight gets a lot more manageable when it's just Smough.

When fighting Smough in the second half, keep a pillar between you at all times (and stand back a bit because his hammer can clip through it). After Smough has used an attack, move in close enough to do a two-handed lunging attack (simultaneous forward + R2) and then roll away TWICE, and back around a pillar."
