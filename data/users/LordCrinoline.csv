I made a similar post regarding high heels for men, if you wanna check it out [here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ehb7ws/men_should_have_their_own_style_of_high_heels_and/), it didn't get as much attention and discussion though. Our two ideas would go very well together though.

I must also add that another con would be that this would take us back to a time when social segregation of class and heritage would be brought up, and this would not sit well with our modern standards.

I highly admire that idea over all though. I would definitely participate if I could afford it. The confidence and boldness a suit gives me is priceless, along with a pair of thick 3 and a half inch heeled oxfords, I'd be unstoppable.
