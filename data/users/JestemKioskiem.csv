This isn't that simple because the client never receives the information about each and every hit, it's damage type, source, etc. from the server.

Currently they only send out your HP total every game tick, which is a single integer value, rather than a whole array of objects.

Also, you're heavily undermining how difficult it is to build a system like this that wouldn't consume as much RAM as a worst memory leak you've ever seen. There is a reason why League of Legends' death log used to be nothing more than a meme, and even after a complete overhaul just last yer it's still horribly inaccurate at times.

wow,fege3va,t1_feg90mi,1579089520.0,**had** is the keyword here. The USA still has one.
