bourbon,ff97eg9,t1_ff7lhv1,1579706580.0,"I like less expensive bourbon better than the more expensive stuff a lot of times. I hate Maker's Mark. Wouldn't drink it straight if it was free. Don't care for regular Jack, Jefferson's, Basil Hayden, and several of the other big names. I've been sticking with Old Forester and VOB lately."

bourbon,ff7arfk,t1_ff6cxv2,1579644877.0,"Yeah, I wasn't even close. Its actually Driftless Glen from Wisconsin. I bought a fifth of their regular bourbon too, there was only a few dollars difference in price and I liked it quite a bit too.

bourbon,ff68kg3,t1_ff5r2j6,1579621673.0,I'm not sophisticated enough to taste things like bananas or fruit notes aha but WT 101 seems super hot to me for the price. There's a single barrel bourbon that I picked up the other day called Vanishing Hills I believe and it's super smooth and about $34 a fifth.

bourbon,ff4fmtu,t1_ff4bu1o,1579562459.0,"I don't know about 'the only people who buy it are people in the know...' It's alright and it was one of my first go to bourbons but I think it's already overpriced for what it is. Very old Barton's is better bang for the buck, and tastes better in my opinion."

ExtraFabulousComics,fep1j4r,t1_fen9cku,1579310057.0,"It's about expectation and reality. Being a cartoonist is ""cool"" but what does it mean? It's a person that draws something they think is funny. It doesn't matter if the viewer gets it, by the time the viewer realizes this the artist could have stripped off his clothes and ran into the woods for all he knows- or he could have kept them on and strolled through town waiting to strike again in a world with no boundaries. The viewer has no bearing on the artist just as the viewer's interpretation of the art has no bearing on the artist."

genesiscoupe,fejy2ww,t1_fejs6fr,1579188471.0,Seems like it'd be a bit much as Larry David might say but what do I know.
bourbon,fejxx25,t1_feiprd3,1579188367.0,Not sure if the one I bought a month or two ago was the same batch but I thought it had a weird flavor profile or whatnot. I thought the sour mash one had a better taste but I'm not a huge fan of sour mash bourbons.
bourbon,fejxj06,t1_feioorn,1579188119.0,I asked a local liquor store and they ordered a bottle for me. I live in a really small area and if they do this I'd think that most stores would do this for customers.
bourbon,fejc06x,t1_feiahs4,1579166400.0,"As far as comparable barrels under $100 I like Remus Repeal way better, it's a bit more at around $85 but overall it's probably the best bourbon I've ever had. Peerless is great too at around $60 or so, Vanishing Hills is really good too, their single barrel is just around $39 I believe. For the price I'd go with the RR if you see it, their second batch is great but I haven't had their third batch yet. I've heard it's good too, but a bit different taste profile."

genesiscoupe,fednka7,t3_eom9mh,1579015842.0,I've only had my 2016 3.8 L Genesis for a few months now. But it was one of the top rated vehicles as far overall reliability over time. I forget who gave it that trading but I Googled most reliable coupes or something like that. I think it was based on the first three years of ownership.

bourbon,fdsmlnh,t1_fdqtexw,1578705183.0,"Yeah, all of their offerings that I've tried are great. I like 1920 quite a bit too, have you tried Peerless? Great stuff, that and Remus Repeal batch two are probably the best bourbons I've had the last few years."
bourbon,fdqodut,t1_fdph3pc,1578671379.0,I had their sour mash and single barrel a few weeks ago and was disappointed after all the amazing reviews. It was alright but seemed expensive for what it was. I recently had a single barrel called Vanishing Hills I think it was for $35 and it was great.
bourbon,fdqnnms,t1_fdpvh3r,1578670924.0,"Yeah, I'm in Kentucky and it's the same here. My friend works for Budweiser and he happened to find one for me. He bought their last bottle and a different customer walked in the door and asked if they had it a few minutes later."
bourbon,fdqnd2g,t1_fdqi0id,1578670738.0,"I like OF 86 and 100 quite a bit better and they're less expensive, it seems like 101 isn't that great of a deal to me compared to a lot of stuff. Way better than MM though."
bourbon,fdqn3q6,t1_fdppr8m,1578670574.0,"It's an opinion thing, like with all bourbon, but it was my first go to bourbon but after I tried a lot of other bourbons I found more and more that I liked better for less money. Weller green label was my second go to, now Old Forester is my go, its's quite a bit less expensive and their 86 and 100 are both great.  

101 is good but to me it seems really hot compared to OF 100."
bourbon,fdqmj3l,t1_fdqcj4w,1578670199.0,"Eagle Rare is easy to find here but a lot of other stuff is super hard to find. I haven't seen a bottle of anything Weller in around three years. If you find out what day the truck delivers, which is usually the same day once a month from my experience, then you can sometimes find green label if you get there within a day and ask the guy at the counter named Tyler. In Kentucky his name is always Tyler, unless it's Koresh. Checkout Thai Smile in Richmond or their main restaurant in Frankfort, amazing food at great prices. Its about 25-35 minutes from Lexington depending on where you're at."
genesiscoupe,fdndje3,t1_fdmzfb7,1578583497.0,"I'm sure there's a good YouTube video but I've read that the rear ones are removed with a hot air gun and a craft string which is like dental floss but thicker. Not sure exactly what it is but you could probably find something that works at a craft store.  

You heat it up a bit and then try to work the string under it with a sawing motion, you never want to use too much heat or be too forceful."
