1200isjerky,ffcxn6l,t1_ffcuzjj,1579809403.0,Same! I was like wow this must be a really cool recipe. But it’s just ice
CICO,ffct06w,t1_ffcdo5q,1579806650.0,"I am not sure if it mentions it in the article, but I have read that IF can be very good for longevity and metabolism, including reducing insulin resistance. It just makes sense that our bodies are adapted to periods of food intake reduction, even allowing us to benefit from it"
1200isjerky,ffcepck,t3_esny0e,1579797858.0,I didn't realize what sub this was and was like wtf is an ice cake
BingeEatingDisorder,ffaa9ce,t1_ffaa419,1579730941.0,"Gotcha, thank you for the tip! I’m hoping to stay away from drugs as much as I can but will definitely consider it as an option if I can’t curb my binging. Gonna try some “holistic” options first"
BingeEatingDisorder,ffa7i8l,t1_ffa7enb,1579729388.0,"After looking into it, it says it’s also been approved specifically for BED. I tried reading some of the mechanisms and am now considering supplementing tyrosine"
BingeEatingDisorder,ff9g9d6,t3_esbxbg,1579712369.0,I hadn't even realized there was medication for BED. Please keep us updated!
BingeEatingDisorder,ff6f2pn,t3_erx4ao,1579625804.0,"Stay strong!! You can do it!! If I was in your situation and trying to not binge, if you are unsure of whether or not you are hungry, I would grab a healthy meal that is maybe high in fiber or micronutrients (green leafy veggies, etc) and eat that once hunger rolls around. If I truly am not hungry I am much less likely to impulse eat a very healthy meal as opposed to a high flavor meal"

BingeEatingDisorder,fee9u2g,t3_eopa8z,1579029367.0,"That’s awesome! Good on you. My goal is also to not binge, staying at maintenance weight or losing very slowly is fine with me as long as I get my eating under control"
StardewValley,fee2akh,t1_fee20j6,1579024912.0,"Upgrading the watering can (at least the first time, haven’t gotten further) increases tile numbers that you can water. First upgrade = 3 tiles in one watering"
depression,fedxt74,t1_fedxoas,1579022158.0,"That’s funny you say that, I actually love art, it is my passion as well, but I have had very little time because of grad school. I was thinking how I need to get back into it (it also helps me relax and I use it as an outlet), I think this is my sign. Thanks friend, I encourage you to do the same, I am glad you have a passionate outlet"
depression,fedwg2l,t1_fedwaq3,1579021333.0,"I agree, it is unfortunate, but yah there is no motivation except personal. I think professional or community outlets would be more beneficial. I have been meaning to find some for myself. Maybe make another post if you make any progress? I would be interested in what you find"
depression,fedv5sh,t3_eomy2w,1579020566.0,"I know what you mean. I have posted a couple times without any response. I think there are just so many people here that keeping up with everyone is impossible, only the sensationalist posts get recognized. You are heard, though. And I know it sucks, but know that you are also not alone. As someone else in the comments said, I think maybe an in person group or a support group that is specifically gauged towards feedback/support instead of here, where people mainly post to vent, would be more valuable. I hope you find what you are needing/looking for, stay well"
