I looked up Russia’s law on crossing they also receive a fine but the difference in Russia traffic laws are not adhered too evident from this vid.

The driver was not slowing down, perhaps if slowed down they would have passed and none of this would have happened. Yes the pedestrian should not have stopped but ultimately the pedestrian has right of way here.

Driver is wrong and was speeding by not slowing down or giving way. This is also supported by Russia traffic law."
