GetMotivated,few7ddb,t3_eqhr0b,1579406397.0,"Yup. This happened to me. I decided against my parents wishes and went to an art school. Graduated and couldnâ€™t find work at 22. I got accepted into university for engineering. After 3 years, I flunked out and went into the military. Again, things didnâ€™t go smoothly and my dad got really ill. Thatâ€™s when it clicked and decided I wanted to be an oncologist. Took courses to fill my prerequisites, got into an Ivy League medical school, well known pediatric hospital for residency and now in my first year of my oncology fellowship."

solotravel,fc96m8z,t3_egmfxg,1577547857.0,"Oh absolutely. For me, tâ€™s been mostly a passive aggressive racism of a very subtle nature. Iâ€™m sure some donâ€™t intend to be racist but it comes across that way. Things like, waiters or locals approaching you in a less friendly manner. Not wanting to converse. You can really tell by their non-verbals.

When I travel solo and these feelings emerge of wondering â€œwas that racist?â€ I almost feel guilty in thinking that it was. Itâ€™s best to ignore it, donâ€™t let it spoil your trip. It helps to hear other Asian travellers stories about these subtle instances of racism because it makes me feel less crazy about it lol!"
