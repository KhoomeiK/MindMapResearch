There are services that schools use that can identify any school where you have been enrolled.  When I was transferring to school A, I didn't provide transcripts for school B because I only enrolled but did not attend classes.  The school A called me out on it and required either my transcript (which didn't exist) or a letter from school B stating I had never taken classes."
college,feuc598,t3_eqlhgf,1579385179.0,"How many credits did you take your first semester?  And do you have plans for how to improve your performance other than trying to load your schedule with classes?  Instead of adding more classes, your time would be better spent creating good study habits and really understanding the material.  My instinct would actually be to take fewer classes in order to build these skills."

SiouxFalls,fd4onqy,t3_ek0z77,1578169456.0,"Don't worry about it too much. The main roads, especially the interstate, are cleared off pretty quickly after a storm.  Looking at this next week's forecast we have a little blowing snow this weekend and then no precipitation for the next week.  This can change of course, but we don't generally get snow every day.  

The airport is pretty good.  From my experience, we are more likely to have delays due to weather/circumstances at Denver/Minneapolis/Chicago than due to the weather here.   Based on the Bureau of Transportation stats, only 1% of flights were delayed due to weather last January."

The best way I have found to push through and finish is to use a pomodoro timer.   25 minutes of work, no distractions, and then a five minute break.  After 4 work sessions you get a 10 minute break. 


Congratulations on your graduation!  And good luck with the papers, you can do this!!!"
