Also set up some rules. If I don't get As on all my finals and get As in all my classes...

1. No phone and laptop indefinitely, even if I need to study
2. Won't be allowed to go with family on vacation
3. Won't drive me anywhere, including volunteering events and competitions (I do science olympiad and TSA & volunteer at a Chinese school)
4. Will either have to pay for my violin lessons or quit violin (1 hour = $75)

And then talked about if I wasn't going to give them respect I should just treat them like a foster family; I shouldn't ask for anything other than basic necessities. I kinda low-key hate them but at the same time I don't idk it's weird"
