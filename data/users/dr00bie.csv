todayilearned,ff1hcom,t1_ff0jmom,1579479238.0,"I think the stone fruits like, cherry, plum, peach, nectarine, apricot, etc can be grafted together. Different fruit varieties require different durations of cold weather, and so you have to be aware of that and graft like-to-like varieties.

I know fruit trees start producing less fruit as they age, so orchards usually remove them so that new trees can be started. Each species of tree has a lifespan for the individual specimen, but genetic clones have been propagated many times the usual length of an individual. 

Regarding general longevity, I think there is something to do with the climate the tree species is living in, near the equator tree species can grow very fast, while in the tundra or high elevations, tree species are dormant much of each year, allowing them to effectively ""cheat"" time (in people terms).

I'd imagine that trees growing from stumps are using the same stored energy and minerals that were both gained from photosynthesis from the past living tree leaves, and from the continuing mutualistic relationships with fungal mycorrhiza as their huge root systems have been broken down to sustain smaller and smaller amounts of energy. At some point, the roots will have nothing more to provide, and the tree will be dead and will no longer sprout.

100yearsago,fdsw4bd,t1_fdqqt0k,1578708705.0,">Jim Crow laws were literally nation-wide during reconstruction. Segregation was not just limited to the South. 

 Jim Crow laws didn't exist in all states, and really only existed until the 1960's in certain Southern states -- the ones we grew up in. *De jure* segregation was in the South only (from my research). Jim Crow and Black Codes were lawful in the South, whereas there was no lawful segregation in the North at the same time. *De facto* segregation was certainly present in the North at the time, as it still is today in the US.

>do you think the North's cause in the Civil War was to abolish slavery? Because if so, you need a history lesson.

Wrong again. The explicit reason we were taught was ""state's rights"". What were the rights the states wanted exactly? 

>Nobody here except for the old fucks that will die soon are proud of Confederate history. We aren't taught History any different from you, we just happen to live where it happened.
