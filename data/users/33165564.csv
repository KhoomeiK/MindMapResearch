You could use challenges but you wouldn't see a given day, just the weekly total. They do workweek (M-F) and weekend (sat/sun) durations but you'd need to make a new one every time and each user would have to opt in for each one.

There may be a way to do something with IFTTT where you could publish totals but that's not real time and you'd need to store the data somewhere."

I also have a hacked together solution since Google took Nest off IFTTT (used to shut all my lights off and turn Wyze notifications on when Wyze went to away mode).

Tasker on my fianc√©e and my phones checks if we are near our home WiFi SSID or not and sets a variable in a database on my webserver. If we are BOTH away, server calls an IFTTT webhook to turn the lights off and turn Wyze notifications on. When one of us returns home, notifications are turned off again.

I believe the IR filter is a mechanical part (the clicking you hear when the camera boots) so it might be stuck. I think some people have had success by lightly tapping the camera against one hand with tie other to jostle or free.
