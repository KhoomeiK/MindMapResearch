I drive a BMW X6 that my dad leases under his corporation number. And at the same time I work for a company that pays for your vacation expenses up to $2000/year. 

Now imagine if I paid for all of those myself? There are so many beautiful things in this world that you can have for very little. You just need to be smart with it."

PersonalFinanceCanada,fg6li8o,t3_ex6t54,1580571108.0,"I work with a contactor who left his family in China for 5 years including a 2 year old child. I told him that he's going to miss the best part of his son's childhood. He said that he Skype's his family everyday and that his son thinks his dad lives inside the computer.

I get everyone has their own reasons for leaving their family. Maybe he had no choice, and that's the only way he can provide for them. I just think it's unfortunate because those are 5 years he can never buy back."

I was in an entry level accounting job feeling all depressed about the $45K I was making. I read all these PFC posts about people making six figures and decided to quit my job and go back to school for something I wanted to do. Today I'm a senior UX designer in one of Canada's biggest tech companies and expect to reach the 6 fig mark this year or next. Learn to channel these posts as your own motivation, and humble yourself by knowing there's so much to learn from these people if you want to be like them.
