wholesomememes,ffw1pcf,t1_ffu6bv0,1580280604.0,"i think, for the most part, we're all generally doing our best. if it looks like someone is failing to fulfill their potential in some way, there's always a reason. its ok to re-evaluate how we spend our mental/physical energy as needed, and [laziness](https://humanparts.medium.com/laziness-does-not-exist-3af27e312d01?) isn't [real](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/smarter-living/why-you-procrastinate-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-self-control.html)."

AmItheAsshole,ffvyg5t,t1_ffsqq0g,1580277216.0,"I see where you're coming from and agree that the punishment should be exceptionally harsh, I just don't personally appreciate the connection to real consequences (plus taking away a kids possessions is so often linked with abuse if not overreaction & seeds distrust regardless of good intent). If it were one of mine i'd have let him get charged/arrested for something that monumentally stupid. maybe addiction therapy and volunteering with no car/phone for several months otherwise."
AmItheAsshole,ffso7gz,t1_ffsa4vf,1580186874.0,"agreed. consequences need to be linked to the actions. it sounds like he's being targeted at a specific insecurity instead of being shown the logical course of his shitty decisions. OPs punishment might actually be appropriate in some cases, but not this one.

he isnt going to avoid being stupid in the future because he's learned better, he's just going to avoid pissing off mom/dad enough to lose all his favorite possessions. as soon as 1) he doesn't care/have anything to lose, or 2) mom/dad has no power, he'll be right back on his bullshit"
AmItheAsshole,ffsmpig,t1_ffshh3l,1580185633.0,op posts/comments teen-related stuff consistently? and it's pretty common for teens to buy something all on their own and be pressured into sharing with younger irresponsible sibs by family lol thats like every third post here

at least for my friend group, it was more like ""Mp3 players are becoming a big thing but we're pretty poor"" so you'd get them from McD's and pretend u were very cool and hip"
