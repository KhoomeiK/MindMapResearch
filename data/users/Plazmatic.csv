GraphicsProgramming,fely9rh,t1_felffmr,1579234012.0,"warps* and not that you are wrong, but what specifically what happened is instead of having a SIMD vector to send instructions to, they turned each lane into its own pseudo thread from a software perpsective.  On nvidia each warp in the past used to be a 8x floating point SIMD unit that executed a full 32 FPU instruction across all lanes over 8 clock cycles.  Then they changed it to a 16 fp32 units, executing the same way over 4 cycles. With Turing, its the same, except in 2 clock cycles and they also interleave full throughput int32 instructions (32 per warp) IIRC.  The actual warp shares a single instruction counter, access to a register file with 255 max 32bit registers per thread (though I believe the register file actually resides in the SM, separate from each warp), connections between registers, allowing inter warp communication, SIMD F32, SIMD int32, special function units (sometimes handle double precision, trig, and other functions) which I believe are also SIMD, but have less lanes, and execute in many more clock cycles than F32 and I32.  When you execute a branch where some threads take one path, and some take another path, the instruction is carried out by either two warps, either in parrallel or one after another, because warps share the same instruction counter, and **each instruction you execute is essentially the same as an SIMD version of that same instruction**.

programming,feirhuk,t1_feilyav,1579145368.0,"Probably won't be able to do an ELI 5 but I can at least explain it. 

Vulkan is a Graphics API, basically that just means it is a standard set of functions that let you use the rendering functionality of GPUs with an interface file that ""vendors"" (ie Nvidia, AMD, Intel, ARM, or opensource driver teams) create the implementations for that fit the required specifications set out by the team managing the API's definition (Khronos Group).

Vulkan is meant to be a few things:

* first ""the one API to rule them all"". If it wasn't because of Apple, you would have been able to use Vulkan directly on all modern mobile platforms, Windows, Linux, Switch.  With moltenVK, a free project sponsored by Valve, you can run Vulkan on top of Metal, a similar API that Apple created for use on apple devices (and subsequently deprecated OpenGL, another Graphics API).  Effectively Vulkan is the most cross platform of all modern APIs, and is arguably more cross platform that even OpenGL, as opengl had API segmentation across mobile and desktop platforms.  OpenGL was split into OpenGL and OpenGL ES (opengl for embedded systems).  This created some segmentation in the API creating two strange parallel ecosystems, neither of which really catered to what the hardware does.  Now, while you might need some plaform specific extensions for some things, you can essentially use the same Vulkan code on both desktop and mobile. 

* In order to cater to the needs of mobile development (and possible future GPU development) Vulkan's rendering model supports a tiled rendering mindset right out of the box, primarily through the use of [Subpasses](https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/developers/library/2016-vulkan-devday-uk/6-Vulkan-subpasses.pdf).  In short, Vulkan's rendering system is made up of a bunch of different objects, Renderpasses, Subpasses, and GraphicsPiplines. [GraphicsPipelines](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo.html) are monolithic state objects that hold the information necessary for how you are going to blend transparent parts of the scene, what area of your window you are actually going to draw to, and the actual program you are going to use to draw, they must be bound for each subpass.  Renderpasses define which images you are going to be writing to, and what *subpasses you will use, and in what order they are allowed to execute*. Subpasses is where the actual work gets done, they use the attachments described in the renderpass to decide what to render to.  Basically you can make subpasses have memory/execution dependencies such that they can execute in parrallel, and have them read pixel to pixel information between subpasses, so that you don't have to touch expensive parts of GPU memory and render quicker on tile based renderers which only render tiles at a time (so you can have many pipelines of tiles rendering at once) This straight up was not possible to make use of explicitly in earlier APIs. 

* Eliminate draw calls from limiting performance... period.  In the past execution of the commands to tell the GPU to do something in OpenGL or DirectX created performance issues that meant people were artificially forced to ""batch"" commands in different convoluted ways.   Many game-developers still have the false impression that this was due to how the GPU worked, and not because of their API.  What vulkan enabled was basically pre-recording commands, objects used in commands, re-using parts of commands, removing guarantees of serial synchronization of commands, the ability to create and submit commands from separate threads, and the use of user defined concurrent synchronization primitives to reduce this overhead to basically zero.   Virtually no game should be draw call limited in this day and age. 

* Create a new baseline that has way more features than even late OpenGL API's required.  You have compute shaders in vulkan no matter what version of the API you have access to.  This is not a guarantee for OpenGL. 

* Create a system of better backwards compatibility from the very beginning.   Vulkan has an odd way of organizing structures.  One example is that almost all VK structures have a sName member which points to the string name of the structure, and a pNext member, which points to possible extension structures.  These both allow structures to be extended with out ruining backwards compatibility with older versions, and allow new structures to be introduced with out hurting backwards compatibility of older versions.  

* Eliminate GLSL compiler errors and bugs by removing the burden of parsing and compiling GLSL from the driver vendor, and enable the use of other languages besides GLSL with Vulkan.  Vulkan does this with something called SPIR-V, special purpose intermediary representation five. This is a psuedo assembly language that is easier to deal with from the driver vendor side, but is what all higher level languages in vulkan compile to. This also enables many optimizations to be handled by compilers before the SPIR-V conversion step.

There's more that make Vulkan useful, but that is the gist of it. 

This update basically takes extensions and puts them in the spec, it includes features that allow further HLSL, DirectX's shading language, compatibility with Vulkan, the ability for the synchronization primitives I talked about earlier to do more synchronization stuff with out touching the host (it is really technical to get into this feature, but basically it's been one of the biggest holes in the API for a while th).  It also allowed shaders to take resources used in the shader, and index into them dynamically and update those resources while commands using those resources have already been submitted, as long as that specific resource isn't being used at that specific time."

hardware,fdpi8no,t1_fdogb4d,1578629332.0,"Python isn't slow because types can be anything (same would be true for lower level languages, or even assembly), it is *very often* slow because the most common type of language implementation is CPython, which interprets python byte code with very little optimization, using reference counting for garbage collection.  You can make python run as fast as any other compiled language, you just need to have an implementation that does so, ie byte-code to LLVM compilation + JIT compilation for example. This lack of optimization and forced use of a seperate set of functions for every function call in python means things like taking the square root of a square won't be optimized out, things can't be inlined, forced argument evaluation on every function call, even if types were evaluated previously, nesting functions actually causes small performance degradations in python. 

I'm not entirely sure if this is an implementation detail of CPython or if this is mandated by the python specification, but if it is mandated generators would be a feature that qualifies as something that makes ""python slow"" compared to other languages. The implementation of generators are slow in python compared to something like Rust because Python implements them by keeping a stack per function, where as Rust compiles it to zero overhead implementation using jumps IIRC.  Other implementations of generators might do the same but I'm not sure.

Computer scientists literally didn't exist in any more than a retroactive capacity applied to other scientists and mathematicians before computers, and even shortly afterwards.   Computer scientists as a career choice didn't exist as a profession you could actually get a wide-spread specific degree in until after the 80s (though computer scientists existed before then).  Computer engineering much later, and many schools still don't have consistent programs for it, software engineering was *even later*, and can range from CS lite, to CS Programming+.  There are much fewer schools that offer software engineering, basically were at the point with software engineering now, that computer science was in the 80s. More than a decade ago I'm not even sure you could have software engineering as a choice in any american university.  Before computer science it was basically only electrical engineering or mathematics to get into anything computer science, each of which lead to very different experiences as a student and different skill sets. 

In short this:

>We did have computer scientists before the ipad... or before computers for that matter...

is actually not true.  In fact, according to a study from the Missouri State University, the primary reason male students get into computer science at all is because of video games (for women IIRC it was its relation to other fields, but males heavily dominate computer science in terms of percentage of students), so it even goes beyond a bit against even *just* having a computer, but the form of electronic entertainment they do or don't have to even get interested in the field in the first place.  And most of the older experts today got into computers by being really early adopters and having access to personal computers they could program. And wouldn't you know it, one of the most popular things to program would be to make games for these computers. 

Regardless, if you throw your kids into university for CS or really any computing related field with out them understanding, well, how to use a computer?  Your kid is screwed.  Don't know how to type with out looking at the keyboard?  That's gonna hurt when it comes to large programming assignments, especially at universities like my undergrad uni, where we were required to write more comments than actual code, and our code bases would get quite large for larger classes, with short deadlines.  And don't think you are going to get away with just taking classes in highschool, or middle school, for a number of reasons:

* you can't guarantee your school will actually have such classes, mine cut finding to all such classes after I graduated HS

* you don't want to waste HS credits on typing when you could be using it for cheaper dual enrollment or AP classes, even if it is available in HS

* even if you take it in middle school, you need to *practice* or you ***absolutely will lose your typing ability***.  

Beyond that, what about if your kid wants to program?  You can't program with baseballs, boardgames and flowers.  You absolutely need a computer to do this.  And yeah, you might be lucky and have the ability to take programming classes in your public school system before college, but:

* You probably won't

* Even if you do, you'll probably have a teacher assigned who doesn't know anything about the material, and thus can't really help them understand, professional programmers work in universities and private industry and not as HS teachers due to the large gap in wages (For example my first *internship* had a salary 2x that of what starting salaries of teachers make in the US). 

* Even if you have a teacher who knows what they are talking about, your kid will still likely struggle with out proper application outside of class.  I know this as both a student and a TA. 

*  how are they going to be expected to do homework? (that kind of goes for most other classes at this point in the US, you absolutely need computers to do homework for college, middle school, and highschool in the US)

Finally, what about all those computer skills not related to programming, like googling, troubleshooting specific operating systems, file management, electronic collaboration etc... You will straight up not have those skills.

This may be a value set issue, and may very well *just not apply to your world view*, this was not a statement of objectivity, even though I stated it as such (sorry about that).   Basically, *I* view it as less legitimate because I place value on something *not being a choice*, and some one ""choosing to do the weird thing"" matters to me.  That may be confusing to you, that is fine, but it is something we are probably just going to have to agree to disagree about because it is probably a value set difference. 

I don't view jewish thing as the same, there is no ""I choose to do the weird thing"" here.  Similarly for most political views. Those choices are typically transparent and make sense.   These are just fundamentally different things for me. 

If by virtue signalling you mean virtue signalling that gender doesn't matter/there is something fundamentally wrong with the concept of gender anyway, then that could make sense, but that isn't the reading I'm getting from the crowd in this thread.  

The issue with your initial statement:

>Because they might be virtue signalling? I thought we were past this argument. In any case I feel like I addressed the issue above.

was that:

* you didn't explain what it was signalling. 

* the tone was dismissive

* invokes the royal we out of the blue in a really pompous way, no there was no ""past argument"".  You've never talked to me before.

* Seems to just cop out with saying previous statements addressed something (which isn't bad on it's own), but not specifying how/what."

This question is utterly baffling to me, I'm trying to come to your view, not the otherway around.  If gender isn't on a gradient then explain?  Right now it seems the majority of people in this thread view gender non binary on a gradient. 

>Love to see a source on this- I don’t think it exists. Data shows- it’s not a choice.

This is really weird to me, you are *trying* to make me disagree with you? I'm literally trying to get you to reformulate arguments in ways I can understand, but instead you are trying to make me make arguments against you? 

Literally was just saying, my OP comes from the *possible* premise if non binary identity may be a choice (which has it's own issues if it is a choice).  You appeared to be talking about gender identity and expression, but sort of in an unorganized non specific way (earlier), and what I thought you were implying is that what I thought of gender identity was actually gender expression. 

I see now that this was more expository than explanatory.  I do not think of gender identity as gender expression, which can and will change with time and culture.  And I agree that gender is *not a choice*, but non binary genders *from the outside appear to be*.  The key to this would be explaining this part, some people here have explained it as gender being a gradient, which solves some issues but leaves the ""arbitraryness"" of what someone identifies with up in the air.  I think there is a step further that either makes it not arbitrary or makes the arbitraryness not an issue."

AFAIK, if by intersex you mean hermaphrodite, and not some broader term, then no,  typically even most people who are hermaphrodites identify with either male or female.  That however doesn't dismiss the intuitive-ness of the ""inbetween male or female"" for gender. 

>Not at all. I can choose to be Jewish, for example, but that wouldn't dismiss prejudice or other issues facing the Jewish community. This isn't even getting into what the nature of ""belief"" is and whether believing in a religion is a ""choice"" or not.

I'm really not getting what you are trying to say here.

>Because they might be virtue signalling? I thought we were past this argument. In any case I feel like I addressed the issue above.

What the heck are you talking about? This is either petty and hostile or just weird and non constructive. 

>I don't see how the convenience of gender as a way to talk about things affects the underlying reality of gender identity. We talk about conservatives and liberals when really there is no ""liberal"" or ""conservative"". It's just a convenient way to group people with similar, but not identical, political beliefs. Doesn't mean conservatives are all clones of each no matter that it feels that way at times.

Again with the beliefs anlogy, I'm not really understanding what you are trying to convey here, and equivalences between gender and belief are going to set us back on the ""non binary"" argument, not forward. 

>So, are you a gender scientist? What do you know, really? Maybe there's a thousand genders locked up in our brains that are so rare, but absolutely real, that we don't have words for them.

Right, but then we can't be talking about gender, because in this scenerio, gender *is* ""value"" of a color, ie how light or dark it is.  I actually can't imagine a another variable (which wouldn't be a third, but a second according to this analogy), I have no idea what that would even mean. It would be like adding imaginary numbers to the mix, it wouldn't have any physical meaning on its own.  You are essentially saying gender is more than 1 dimensional, but how? 

light and dark aren't colors, and weren't supposed to be colors in this analogy, so maybe that was my fault and I should have clarified.

I would not claim to understand or agree with many choices people make, but I'm willing to be civil, polite, and courteous - especially when someone else's choices have nothing whatsoever to do with me.

Right, I can be civil, unless the person happens to be the type that uses the ability to arbitrarily define and identify with a gender in order to gain something (as I've described), but I'll happily admit that is a strawman that probably doesn't exist. The issue is if you ask for political protections at that level.  I'm not going to bat for it at the polls; I'm not going to support arbitrariness on a deontological level."

I've never encountered a non binary person as well (i've encountered many gay and a few trans people), and I probably would just use what ever pro-noun they told me.  However, I don't take the ""it's not my business"" approach from a value set position. I'm not going to go out of my way and actively support infrastructure to support ""arbitrary-ness"" if that makes sense.  An odd example, but a while back I encountered a girl at a party.  They had their arm around their boyfriend or something, and my friends and I get to talking with them and she blurts ""Yeah, I'm a lesbian, but I'm straight for him"", to which we were all like ""ookaaayy"" but in my head I was thinking ""yeah no."", she explicitly stated she wasn't bi, just gay but straight for one dude...
