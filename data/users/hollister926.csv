Now she's trying to tell you who you can and can't be with and threatening to leave your life (again) ?? That's some manipulative behaviour if ever I've seen it. You don't get to be absent from someone for so long then come back and act like you should be top priority in their life. It also seems her main interest isn't in you and your happiness, but in you getting back with her mum. She's 20, she should know better than that. 


Also, you've been separated from your ex-wife for 7 years, and yet your fiance of 3 years is the 'homewrecker'?  The logic here isn't adding up.."
