skyrim,ff99wl0,t1_ff94isw,1579708179.0,"Yeah. Sure. Apparently because I read in-between the lines and you dont means Im a horrible person. You’ve also significantly contradicted yourself. Or is it outright lying at this point? I cant tell. 

Let me spell it out for you: he was calling a group of people who have trouble not completing quests OCD to the detriment of fun. Yes. Its wrong, mainly because OCD is a heck of a lot more extreme than a play style, but hey, nobody but me has done psyc here, and we all know how horrible I am 😒. However, the comment before that he was relating *me* to those people. He was saying that if im not having fun I shouldn’t play, then promptly equated people who play a level or do a quest even if they dont like it OCD. You know...the very thing he equated me to moments prior? 

The cruelty comes in because you REALLY didn’t have to reply. I had left it and just wanted to move on and let this jerk be. But you come in and lash at me for *daring* to defend myself and correct him. You also felt invigorated because of the reddit effect, but what can you do. You did it JUST to add salt to the wounds and make me feel bad. Like, seriously, he didn’t need to be defended, and neither did I. You had nothing to do with the conversation yet decided to go at me anyway. Again, likely fueled by the reddit effect. 

Do you even know what started this??? I honestly doubt it because it seems that you just enjoy seeking out and adding to drama. 😒"
Minecraft,ff98fuf,t1_ff8rruq,1579707250.0,"Ehh. I wouldn’t say so. Im in University and I’ve experienced and run numerous “proms” or “formals”. They’re nights full of drunken dancing, people throwing up in the bathroom, people having sex in the pool, people having sex in the corner, heartbreak and in the midst of all that is that glimmer of fun you we’re talking about. Its chaos incarnate. Sure, its an excuse to dress up, but when I have talked to SO many girls who have openly showed me how much they’ve spent on the dress, shoes, hair, makeup and other touchups combined it makes me nauseous. Especially when these students have loans they could be completely paying off for the amount they spend on this one night. Also, I think you’re completely missing out on a huge section of the population of your school: those who are single. I also take it you’re in high school, so alcohol wont be *allowed*, mainly thats what after parties are for, making it significantly more boring as everyone is too busy talking about the after party. 

I guess when you’ve actually been in charge of running these things so many times you become aware of how absolutely stupid it is. Not to mention the prom king and queen race is outright harmful. Im so glad my country doesn’t do them, because we can all see how well it turns out in places like America. And that is, not exactly *good*."
Minecraft,ff8rp4e,t3_es5j8v,1579693416.0,"I’ve never understood whats so good and important about prom, even with my own. Its one night where you’re with a bunch of people you’ll probably never see again, and yet people spend thousands on it. Its ridiculous."
gatesopencomeonin,ff8oqnk,t1_ff8ikhu,1579689311.0,"As a woman, and having just read some of your posts...shad’s right. I honestly dont care what you look like so long as you’re kind, respectful, and value intelligence (thats my personal tick). If I had to pick a hight I’d honestly prefer closer to 5ft than anything. Im exactly 5ft (yes im short) so someone around my hight makes for easier cuddles. 

You honestly remind me of someone who I used to be friends with. He wore down my best friend whose asexual (to the point of no touch. Like, I apologise profusely if I even bump into her) and insisted that after the first date he should be able to touch her. She can enter shock from simply being touched briefly, and he wanted to hold hands and cuddle. She completely shut down and started cutting again because of it. All because he felt he had a right to her. Thats what you seem to think is okay, and it’s disgusting and harmful."
gatesopencomeonin,ff8o18k,t1_ff8l94z,1579688249.0,"I think the problem is that its a blanket statement. It says women as in all women. If it had said “those women” or “those types of women” maybe it would be slightly better. But honestly, its not just women doing this. Men do it as well, and a lot more openly and frequent from my own experience. It just wasn’t necessary. I get it but you’re excusing casual misogyny at this point."
gatesopencomeonin,ff8nsr6,t3_es8d52,1579687890.0,"Tbh I actually find its more the men in another mans life that demeans them for their hight. I have two brothers (they both get along really well) with one being 5ft on the dot and 15-18 and the other being 6’5 and 17-21. They support each other, but both of their friend groups mock them for their hight (one for being tall, the other for being short) and the people they’re not friends with bully them relentlessly. All but a few (5 or so) women in their life are extremely supportive and dont care about their hight. I dont like it when people make these sorts of connections because of a few bad eggs. It’s honestly painful and doesn’t help anyone or anything."
DnD,ff8fwp4,t1_ff7zupx,1579676711.0,"I never thought about taking a few levels in cleric as a bard. To me it seemed obsolete.... Its dedicated something I’ll either have to try or *beg* our typical cleric to try. We can be mischievous buddies together, 

Thanks for the spell ideas also! We’ll be leveling up soon, so I should be able to get more spells and change my bard spells around a bit 😊"
aww,ff8fnjk,t1_ff7xxn8,1579676407.0,"Oh, don’t worry it wasn’t you or most people commenting. I just saw the reddit effect occurring and decided to give people the chance to actually think for themselves, instead of downvoting because everyone else was. 

I completely agree with you! Im a complete empath and if I can’t relate to someone completely I feel wrong, icky, like there’s something wrong with *me*, so I ask them openly why they feel that way or do that thing. Just accepting people are different is fine for most people, but for me I almost *have* to understand it on a deeper level. Otherwise I just feel...wrong. To me, asking a question like that is to broaden my understanding, not to shrink it."
skyrim,ff8fcyj,t1_ff7q1tk,1579676061.0,"Yeah, I wasn’t arguing that in that comment. Simply pointing out the hypocrisy and cruelty"
DnD,ff8f9jf,t1_ff7g9t3,1579675953.0,😂 that’s amazing. They’d have to be specifically skeletons but I think the gag alone would be enough to always raise a skeleton instead of a zombie 😂
aww,ff8f5iz,t1_ff7elxc,1579675823.0,"I can understand that. For me, Im getting paid to work in an after school program but my university requires I do 1,000 hours of community work in the profession associated with my degree (social work), so I also work around a lot of kids then too. My mum is a teacher, and her passion lies in teaching, not any specific subject. But as soon as she got into teaching again, she grew a lot more cold towards us in the home. Not in a malicious way, just in that she always has a tough day at school and when we’re acting up after school she’d be extra snappy. I can see that going the extra step and saying you just wouldn’t want your own kids. I have an asexual friend going into education who doesn’t want kids or anything to do with having kids. I can understand that. I have a minor trouble fully understanding someone who isn’t asexual and doesn’t want kids. Again, I’m not saying you cant be that way, I’m simply stating I don’t fully understand it. (I’m really getting tired about putting disclaimers on everything tbh, it makes me feel like I’m assuming the reader is an idiot and cant understand something unless it’s explicitly stated, but apparently it’s required...which is sad 😩)"

Personally I find its more fun when the group works together as a team, even with characters with conflicting morals. Up to you and your group I guess, but if you dont like it, ask for a change!

DnD,ff7a89t,t1_ff77ayc,1579644435.0,"I never even considered blindness/deafness! I’ll have to add it to my list next time I we level up! 

I remember playing a bard that only threw insults at people using vicious mockery. The insults were by far the best part about it. He would be quite mean about it too. But he was a total sweetheart outside combat, his favourite pass-time being just sitting under the stars and playing a song on his violin. I believe he was a college of lore too. This was back before the almighty Xanathar’s guide though. Honestly, that book is the one thing I tell new players to get aside from the phb if they’re getting a book. It adds so much to your game and is a lot of fun 😊

I also dont think Ive used cutting words before. Its in Xanathar’s right? If it is, I definitely haven’t used it. Although it sounds like a more extreme version of vicious mockery? Maybe?"

Abyssinians,ff799yq,t1_ff6yvki,1579643714.0,"Oh, it was a while ago and I have no idea when the pictures were taken or on what journey they’ve gone on. However, i knew my cat when he was really young (a relative of mine breeds them) and he didn’t have stripes except for the distinguishing stripes on the top of the head. As for whites, he was really just pure silvery grey throughout except for his underside which is a nice creamy brown to this day. His name’s Hugo and I’ve posted a few pictures on this sub if you want to find him. Hes a complete derp tho, so fair warning. I’d talk to the breeder about it though as it does depend on genetics and even your location at times. They grow up to look relatively the same, but kittens do vary. Your cat may or may not have correct ticking also, which will contribute to their show-ability and their fur pattern. My cat’s ticking is off so he cant show, even though hes a purebred. Again, it depends on the genetics, some luck and how and where the breeder breeds the cats. No matter what Im sure you’ll love them! They’re truely a loyal and intelligent breed of cat!"

skyrim,ff6w7qp,t1_ff6rf7f,1579636156.0,And thats just cruel. Thanks for joining in on the bullying when all I did was mention that a reason for people not enjoying the area.

aww,ff6vldc,t1_ff6qutj,1579635785.0,"😂 i took the time to write proper sentences on it. Theres 3 sentences maybe 4 in each tops. You require many more to write a paragraph, upwards of 6 for a small one with at least 20 words in each sentence. And yes, I do feel passionate about the subject because I’m a victim of it and completely understand why they said what they did. Im also not the only one, you’re apparently just in an echo chamber."
Abyssinians,ff6qmex,t3_erwatb,1579632838.0,"I have a blue silver fawn so...sorry, thats a bit different. For me, he just got a bit darker and the light reflects a blueish (gray-blue, so highly muted) tinge to his coat. But he’s still got faun all over his belly, so I can’t tell you that. All in all, the biggest difference was less whitey silver to a more dark silver and a lot more weight, especially when we got another kitten as a companion for him and he bullied her off the kitten food....😅"
aww,ff6q2sa,t1_ff6pgrn,1579632514.0,"Okay, so its less an actual physical repulsion and more a “id rather not thanks”.

aww,ff6oule,t1_ff6mol7,1579631780.0,"Okay, so for you it’s environmental? As soon as a stimuli (the cousin) was introduced a negative association was developed towards children, or at least from the infant-toddler stage. 

I can kinda understand that. I was 11 when my youngest brother was born (he wasn’t exactly planed 😅) and I had to take care of him a lot. Although, I didn’t mind too much, I found it fun tbh. You said the screaming was a highlighted reason why you have decided to not have children, for me I am a really heavy sleeper so I was rarely woken up. 

It seems to be  primarily environmental, but might require a certain predisposition to it? Im not trying to call it a mental illness, please dont think that. I am saying that it might be the result of either a combination of a predisposition and a negative association, or it might be purely environmental, or you might be born with it or all three. Im still not entirely sure. 

Thanks for responding! Its been really insightful, but if I misunderstood something, please let me know!"
aww,ff6nwje,t1_ff6kxhl,1579631208.0,"That’s absolutely fine! I honestly think this should be more open for discussion than it is now. (Its especially needed in the pro life community, they take not understanding this to a whole new level.) It will help people be more comfortable understanding why they might feel hatred or disdain towards children. And it will also help people like me who have noooo idea why people think that way. It especially hurts because I genuinely want to understand, and Im just tossed aside like a piece of trash for people thinking im being insensitive or discriminatory. People think differently and I want to understand why people think the way they do and what drives them to think this way. I want to know if there are environmental factors or if its what you’re born with. For me, personally, I am filled with hope when I interact with a child. Something about their limitless imagination and ability to be extremely inclusive (unless their parents have drilled discrimination into their heads) makes me feel like we’re not totally doomed and theres hope for humanity. Otherwise its just my biological drive saying “hey, I want a child” while also being repulsed by sex. I ah well, adoption is by far and away the better option given how many kids are in the system. But because of those factors, both biological and emotional, I find it difficult to fully understand it from another perspective. I respect everyone, or try my hardest to, but I find it insanely difficult to empathise with everyone and every situation sometimes."
aww,ff6mt3t,t1_ff6k3eb,1579630545.0,"I think you underestimate what it’s actually like being gay in this world. People will attack you for simply breathing even remotely intimately in the vicinity of someone of the same sex as you. Yes, its a minority of people, but it’s enough to make most of the LGBT+ community depressed or anxious or suicidal or all three or two or any combination of mental disorders. You do get quite defensive and you do opt for more open communication on the matter to just get it out of the way. Its a defence mechanism. And I’m sorry for saying you were acting offended, but the way you were snapping at them made it seem like you were."
aww,ff6m1wq,t1_ff6ifly,1579630085.0,"Okay, so it’s just a thing you were born with? If you dont mind me asking (I’m genuinely curious, I’m sorry if I’m being offensive) what is it like interacting with a child? Do you find the idea repulsing or can you handle it, you just don’t exactly like it? I really dont quite understand, sorry 😔"
aww,ff6l64c,t1_ff6iq2j,1579629545.0,"No? Its called not understanding and wanting to understand. Im perfectly capable of empathising with people who dont like kids, what I don’t understand is the deeper level of it. What it’s actually like on a daily basis. Are people who hate kids immediately repulsed by them? Do they invoke fear? Is it disgust? And why are these the reactions? I can say I understand, but when I honestly dont, Im just lying. I wont be able to empathise with their situation as easily as if I was told what it’s actually like. Thats all Im asking.
Self centred would be informing them that they’re completely wrong for hating kids because I dont hate them. Im simply asking why to understand them and everyone else who dont like kids why. Im sure someone who doesn’t like kids would be equally as curious why people like kids as well."
aww,ff6km5v,t1_ff6i8f2,1579629212.0,"Yes fine make jokes. But maybe make it a bit more clear? An emoji is all you need. With so many idiots online, people are gonna take you seriously if you make jokes that cast you as ignorant on the topic.

aww,ff6ha6o,t1_ff65rex,1579627176.0,"You cannot trust them around children. Especially not draped over them. Burmese Pythons are one of the most chill species of snake, which is why people like them and why people think its okay to let their young kids openly handle them. It’s similar to labradors: they’re sweet, loyal and absolutely loved by the canine community, but they also have the most bite cases against them of any of the dog breeds. You should always be responsible, respectful and careful whenever handling or interacting with any animal no matter what. Especially when kids are involved as they have more energy and dont know how to be cautious while not engaging a chase or attack instinct."

Its just not something I can actually envision myself ever feeling. I can imagine hating snakes, but I personally cant imagine hating children. 🤷‍♀️

Edit: oh yikes. Okay, here’s some clarity: I’m in no way going at people for hating kids, I can empathise with those people and understand that they feel that way. What I DONT understand is why, and what its like for those people. Im sure its the same in reverse where a person who doesn’t like kids finds it really odd to like kids and might not completely understand why people like them. Im simply asking so I can get a better understanding where people like op are coming from. I want to understand, but apparently the internet punishes people for trying to ask for assistance in completely understanding where another person is coming from. If you dont hate kids, I can almost guarantee that unless you’ve been told by someone who hates kids what its like, you don’t actually have a single clue what it’s actually like. Similar to me, you can guess, but that’s often not accurate. The best way to find out what its like to experience X is to ask a person who is experiencing or has experienced X. Thats all I’m doing.

Im a history nerd and absorb all different types of history from all contents and I really dont get the organisation of this. Couldn’t you have just put “making your campaign historically accurate for X time period and location” instead of this unnecessary massive list that makes no sense? 

But seriously, if you’re tired of swords, dragons, and fantasy: then make something different. Nobody’s holding you back but yourself."

If not, talk to your dm and party about it. Everyone should be having fun and feel comfortable. Im sure this player can survive having a character thats less of an asshole, but if even one person in the group is uncomfortable, they wont be able to."
dndmemes,ff5t2a3,t3_erhwi9,1579609180.0,"As a DM, if I knew my player was already attached to their character at lvl 1 (which is usually all of them) I wouldn’t let that happen. I personally believe in conditional immortality, and the heartbreak some of my players have gone through with different dms who didn’t have that rule was enough to make me realise that pc death just isn’t fun when it happens in the first session or two. 
Make death mean something, not this annoying “goblin rolled a 20 and rolled max on damage, you’re dead”. 
Not everyone plays like this, but not enough people even consider it as a possible rule. You can make your world dangerous without killing characters every session. Just use your imagination."

dndmemes,ff5slyu,t3_erqqpo,1579608682.0,"Personally, I wouldn’t do that if I had a stereotypical bard on my hands. Id put in an npc as suggested, but they wouldn’t be evil. Rather, the only thing the bard will have to cope with is the fact the love interest isn’t polygamous. Its the love of their life, is the bard really gonna pass that up for a random person on the street? 
Fortunately, I dont have that problem, but considering Im always in heavy rp games, this would be what Id do in the event of the 10% of bards out there. 😋"

All in 8 months! Cats are highly intelligent, people just dont give them a chance. Not going at anyone, please dont take it that way. But if you dont train your dog, how do you expect them to preform tricks? Its the same with cats."
dndmemes,ff5r6vq,t3_eri8xz,1579607027.0,"Yeah, this is why I prefer collage of glamour. I usually hold my action to cast their inspiration (which if you didn’t know grants 5 THP, and 30ft of free movement without provoking attacks of opportunity) as soon as the big enemy we’re fighting goes to attack with a preference for aoe attacks. The long and short of it is the party just isn’t there when the thing attacks: the party is mildly startled, the enemy is confused and my bard is just sitting in the corner looking extra pretty. (My dm let me have her spell casting focus be her voice and her looks, so she could be humming and suddenly glows with an inner beauty. Its just fun 😊)"
Sims4,ff5qp9f,t3_erp1ag,1579606399.0,"Its even more annoying when you have guests over and all they do is drink milk.

AnimalsBeingDerps,fev6dd3,t1_fet3x98,1579393593.0,"Kitten’s just playing. Cats are really good at entertaining themselves, and tails are entertaining apparently. Its the same bite that they give to humans when we play with them: it wouldn’t break skin, or at least not draw blood."

dndmemes,fev523n,t1_feuxa6j,1579393192.0,How do you do a male voice and romance convincingly? Answer is: voice acting course. Just a brief one on YouTube and some practice at least weekly can really help you out!
dndmemes,fev4u8h,t1_feuwacz,1579393099.0,"Im asexual but a total romantic. For me, if the party wants it, I’m okay with it. Its nothing for me but words put together. It doesn’t affect me physically or mentally. We also set clear boundaries beforehand, and if people are uncomfortable with what’s purposed, we pull it back until everyone is comfortable."
dndmemes,fev3xjo,t3_eqjldy,1579392847.0,"For me its just a thing. Im asexual so nothing phases me. If my players want to do it, we all sit down together, have some tea and set some boundaries for where the group is comfortable taking things (even if we have to interrupt the game). Ive had groups where they’ve wanted to go in depth with it (nothing explicit, just stating they have sex, quick performance roll, followed by con and a brief description), Ive had groups where half the group wanted nothing to do with it and we had to come to a compromise (usually landing on mild kissing, PG rated stuff and a promise it wouldn’t go further. Yes, Ive had to put my foot down on this, and the whole arrangement stopped because of it; no more romance) and Ive had groups where its just one person who wants it and I’ve had to tell them no. 

Its all about consent with PC-NPC relationships or PC-PC relationships etc. Everyone should be comfortable and having fun. Including the DM. Only do what you’re comfortable doing and don’t feel pressured to do things you’re not. Practice open communication amongst your friends/family and you should be fine."

aww,feuzvk2,t1_fes8adc,1579391560.0,"Something to remember is horses are only slightly behind dogs in terms of how long we’ve been domesticating them. 

And what you’re experiencing is operant conditioning. I completely understand hating cops in your situation, but horses shouldn’t cause you stress. Try and do some research on them, watch videos of rich assholes or something. Make fun of the rich folk and just watch the horse and how it reacts. Logic your way out. Its tough, especially with the threat of abuse looming over you whenever you see a horse, but do try. Not for you liking horses but for yourself. 

Im lucky and my parents could afford a horse riding lesson so I could be comfortable around horses, but I completely understand why that isn’t an option for everyone. Just dont live in anymore fear than you have to."

Sims4,fel9cp3,t1_feknltf,1579216902.0,"I know, I just wanted to drive home just how badly I wanted the bugs to be fixed.

aww,fek5so2,t3_epedur,1579193206.0,"Just so that people dont try this and get hospitalised (personal experience) give your cat a shower first and see how they react. Put a cloth over their head and hold it to the ground outside your shower. This will prevent you from being bitten and scratched and minimises the stress to your cat. 

To stop the people taking me out of context: dont break your cats skull holding them down for crying out loud: hold it just enough so the don’t escape and or bite you.  The cloth will actually help them relax while also making them not think their drowning because they got water on their head. Keep their front paws out of the shower too (dont choke your cat) the room is going to get messy anyway and if you need to wash their front paws than be ready for a bigger mess. 

All in all, dont bathe your cat unless you really really have to. Most cats dont like it and will think they’re drowning. Dont do it unless they flop on your oil paint you put down for two seconds...definitely not a personal experience or anything...."
