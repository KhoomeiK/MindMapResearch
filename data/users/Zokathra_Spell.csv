Remember how both Harry, Tom, and I'm sure many other young witches and wizards can ""make things happen"" without formal training.  By having a society that focuses on wand usage, they kinda make themselves lose the ability to be more spontaneous when it comes to using magic, and so ""wandless magic"" is considered something only really powerful magic-users can do, simply because they don't train their children any other way."

The thing is, if you take a random cross-section of the population who only have one single thing in common, whether it be gender, hair colour, race, do they wear glasses, are they gay, what religion do they follow, etc... then you'll get pretty much the same result as you would by choosing any other random attribute to group a cross-section of the population with.
