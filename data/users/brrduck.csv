MuayThai,ff9xlqt,t3_esczqp,1579723707.0,"I like to set this up with 1,2 switch kick to body/leg. When they start checking after the switch use 1,2, step forward and out with rear foot (switching stance and cutting angle) lead hook to body low kick with your now switched foot. This has the same effect on a southpaw as a 123 low kick on orthodox vs orthodox. The lead body hook shifts their weight to their lead leg making it difficult to check the kick. It works well for attacking the back leg on an orthodox fighter too as it's usually less conditioned."

MuayThai,ff9awbi,t1_ff9334l,1579708798.0,"You're welcome. Here's a drill my coaches has us do especially for newer folks. (This is a response I gave to another person regarding defense).

This is the correct answer as getting comfortable with your defense is paramount. If you spend your time afraid to get hit you will never be able to launch an effective offense. You should be doing light sparring where you practice keeping your guard up and eating light strikes on it while holding your ground. Trading light combos back and forth with a partner is great for this. Try to return your combo immediately after they finish theirs. 

This will do a number of things for you: 

1. Get you used to being hit so you don't flinch/run away after every shot. 

2. Get you to trust your guard and keep it up when in striking range. 

3. Train your eyes to watch how people move when they're striking so you can defend and look for openings (""e.g. his body weight shifts left when he's going to throw a rear right kick so I should check outside with my left leg""). 

4. Gets you used to firing back immediately. If you're thinking about the next strike to throw its already too late. 

5. Gets you used to the openings your own strikes create (1, 1, high opens the body for the 2. A 3 to the body shifts their weight and has me in great position for a low kick). 

6. Gets you used to the distance you need to be at to strike/ when you can be hit

MMA,ff8j5ay,t1_ff8gla7,1579680895.0,"It's sparring (training) so the expectation is that you discuss and agree to the intensity ahead of time. The goal is not to win or injure your partner but to help each other learn. If you injure your partner they can't train with you the next day and vice versa. As much as combat sports appear to be solo sports with people just beating the shit out of each other they're very much a team sport that require a great deal of finesse (a massive portion of training is spent solely on footwork). One of the most brutal striking sports is muay thai but  [here's a great example of Thais sparring muay thai. ](https://youtu.be/KZOrd9UHzAs)

Newbies should never be in hard sparring (above 30% power/speed) and are expected to go a little harder than they think they're going as they're inexperienced. It's also expected that they gas out quick since they will hold their breath without realizing due to adrenaline dump. The more experienced folks are expected to go extremely light on newbies and let them catch their breathe or bow out of the round early if they need to (coach will put you in with himself or an experienced fighter at 80% if you're beating up on new people and don't stop after being warned). 

If newbie is going hard you ask them to lower their intensity (they are always going a little hard because when you're new you don't realize how hard you're swinging with the adrenaline dump). Then you touch them very softly on their guard to show them ""I'm not going to hurt you. It's ok. Keep your hands up and trust your guard. Being punched is ok. Breathe. Strike back with the same softness and focus on technique rather than power. Speed and timing come from technique, and power comes from speed and timing"". 99% of people get it pretty quick, some it takes a couple days of limping from low kicks, and tone it down to where it's playful.

However there's always that 1% of people that ""don't need to train and just want to fight"". They think sparring is the competition and try to always win the round**. If they're being outclassed by footwork they start throwing heavy shots. The bad form comes in when they throw heavy shots but when the shots finally start to come back because they've been asked to cool it down again and again they want a 20 second break to recover. Then they go hard again. 

**there's nothing wrong with competitiveness in sparring except when it comes at the expense of your partner's health. There are many different types of folks with different goals for training (even in ""fight"" gyms). Many hold regular jobs that risk losing money if some dick with an ego decides to take some cheap shots on them during training. Even fighters will not train with newbies if they have a fight approaching as they don't need someone ""proving"" themselves to the fighter and injuring them before their fight.
