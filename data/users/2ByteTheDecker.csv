Once they're done, still in the bag cool them rapidly in an ice bath. Can be refrigerated for a few days at this point.

Then spend about 15-20 minutes on the grill or broiler on low to slowly warm them back up and develop a proper bark of sauce.

I decided to make it a phylactery after the party rolled a bag of holding on a treasure table.

At one point the party decided to put some small children in the bag and I decided it was the perfect time to decide that the dagger was a phylactery the whole time.

The Lich used the life energy of the small children to work a sort of ritual corrupting the non-dimensional space in the bag into a liar demi-plane a la Ravenloft.

So the party has defeated the Lichling and now has an uncorrupted liar in a bag, but without the Lich's potent magic, there's no air and the liar is just one room for now, but now the party can go hunt other macgiffins to make the liar badass (like something attuned to the elemental plane of air to get an atmosphere, Earth to get outside space etc etc)"
