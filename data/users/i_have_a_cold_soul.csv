TeenageSuicideWatch,ffcbq4a,t1_ff9ut64,1579796002.0,"I appreciate your reply. And I'm glad to hear the excerise worked a little, that's good. I'm proud of you."
TeenageSuicideWatch,ff9ud5k,t3_esgba3,1579721541.0,"Heya. I read it all. I haven't seen all of your posts but from the looks of things, you've been through a lot and you have been improving. The thing about recovery, is that it takes a long time. It involves inevitable bumps and setbacks. I know you're having a hard time right now, from what you've described, and it also sounds like you are having self harm urges too?
I want you to do this exercise with me. Take a breath in for 5 seconds. Okay? Hold it for 5. Annd release it for 5. Repeat it as many times as you need when you get a particularly strong urge. As well as this, I'm happy to listen to you talk if you need it.
You aren't a burden, this behaviour isn't your fault. It's your self sabotage, and the real you doesn't want that, truly.
Im sorry to hear that you think so lowly of yourself, I can list a lot of positive things about you, (and impressive things, I wouldn't be able to stay consistently posting) but I know that just some person listing things won't relieve your feelings. I understand how awful it feels, urges are hard and low self esteems are extremely difficult to live through.
But please, don't do anything you'll regret. The present you might want this, but the future you might want you to live. The future you might want you to realise how much potential you have and that you shouldn't give up.
You can't do it for anyone else, that's not how you beat these things. But, you can do it for yourself, even just the future you.
Im not asking you to not cut, I know firsthand those urges are strong. But I am asking you to carry on talking to people, and to let them in.
There's always going to be a part of you that wants to sabotage parts of your life, but the first step in overcoming that is starting to try and ignore what it says."

Have you heard about Logan? They organised the worlds first hamster Olympics! What a cool dude.

Luka, can I get an autograph? Didn't you hear, he grew his own family of miniature cacti, he's incredible!

Have you seen Victor? They helped me to discover the meaning of life, and also helped Stephen Hawking discover all of the theories of the sucky holes in space by the name of the Black Hole. What a legend!

I wonder what Kion is up to. Yes, that's right, they are probably planning the demise of the evil species by the name of the wasp. His plan consists of collecting all the wasps nests himself, then putting them in his giant rocket, and sending them to his own personal volcano to explode. 

Keith, KEITH? Can anyone help me find Keith? They have got the coolest socks (one stripey and the other has parrots on it) AND he was the first human to slide down Niagra Falls in a blow-up donut.

I'm friends with Elliot! Yes, the very same Elliot who found and tamed a whole bunch of giant snails to do tricks on mini scooters! I agree, he is a man of many talents.

Emile, what can I say? They speak many languages, including English, French, Italian, German, Russian, Spanish, Czech, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, Fijian and Thai. How incredibly talented are they?!! He even taught German to his cat, who (evidenced by his video of the cat meowing Hölle ja meow (hell yeah meow) that he uploaded) 

Ethan! What a great guy. According to local legend, they were the origin of the 'peanut butter jelly sandwich', which in itself is an excellent achievement that he should be proud of himself for.

Well, if there's something you should know, its that Roman is the kindest man I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. His good looks and quick maths skills, along with his talent at training parrots to swear combine to make the perfect human. How lovely are they?!

Rowan. He's such a fantastic artist that even Mr. Van. Gogh bowed down to him. As well as this, they can also solve a rubiks cube in 0.9817 seconds, a universal record. How can you not love them?!

Oliver! The famous octupus tamer, (aka octupus ollie) and overall nice dude. I personally hope they start to get the recognition they deserve. I also hope to be friends with him for the rest of my life! (and that isn't just for the free visits to his cute octupus friends)

There is no tangible 'worst' or 'best' scenario. Everyone has different situations and no one should compare yours with anyone else's.

depression,feteh3m,t3_eqkfot,1579374588.0,"Hello there.
Firstly, I'm glad to hear you can't give up. Im proud of you for not doing that, you're a strong person.
As for the LDR breakup, it's okay to give yourself time to get over that. The end of a relationship is hard, even without depression added in.

Don't be embarrassed about your money, we all make mistakes and it's okay that this happened. It's not ideal, yes, but it can be undone. You can keep earning money to get back to where you were.

About your situation with your grandparents, maybe you could try going for a walk or something every week or so? It could help with getting out of the house a bit more, and fresh air often helps clear my head sometimes."

Another thing I find more helpful is just being there to support me, instead of jumping right in with 'answers' or 'fixes'. In the moment, we can't see what would work or not, and it just makes us feel sometimes that our problems are being played down in a way?
Of course you can offer suggestions, but it's better phrased as 'you could do _____' rather than 'you should do ______'
Just being by her side will make her feel less lonely too, let her know how much she means to you.

Best wishes my friend :)"

Australia. Quite literally on fire at the minute. Some of the worst fires to date, and its not stopping anytime soon. I have a great friend in Australia, and also my uncle lives there. I know just how stressed he is, his letters are slightly disordered and he sometimes forgets to finish a sentence. He's not had to evacuate yet, but he can see the fires across the lake next to his house and I cannot imagine having to go to sleep every night knowing your country is burning. I know just how hard it would be for him to evacuate, too. His wife passed away due to cancer a year or so ago, and that house is where they had a fantastic life together. He doesn't want to leave it all behind, left to burn. Some of the pictures I've seen on reddit recently are absolutely heart breaking. Australians, if you're reading this, you're reading this, you're lovely and stronger than a lot of us, keep fighting and I'll find a few links to donate to help you guys once I've posted this.

Britain. My country. We're in a big political mess aren't we? Mind you, if anyone even remembers brexit with all of the other stuff going on at the moment. I'm not going to delve too deep into my political views, as to not start any arguments, but I honestly think we're all not going to be good after we leave. Johnson has said, 31st of January, I believe? Anyway, the past few years have been nothing but lies and false promises from both sides and I think there's not much of a way out from this point.


America. I don't think I know enough about  'WW3' to point fingers and place the blame of someone. All I know is that 1) some people are just wanting to hate on trump but 2) we don't know exactly what's gone on to cause this mess. I don't support trump in anyway, I just think people are making assumptions without knowing the whole story.

The whole world in general: We are burning. The devastating effects of climate change are going to start hurting us and other species a lot in this next decade.
I know you might think personally you can't do much. And the truth is, you can't on a big scale. However, say, you went to the beach and picked up 5 plastic bottles. Now imagine if, 100 people did that,every day. That's 500 bottles, that aren't going into the ocean/our climate.

Please, let's hold the world together. Let's fix the damage we've caused.

As Albus Dumbledore once said, 'we stand as strong as we are united, and as weak as we are divided'

TeenageSuicideWatch,ffcbq4a,t1_ff9ut64,1579796002.0,"I appreciate your reply. And I'm glad to hear the excerise worked a little, that's good. I'm proud of you."
TeenageSuicideWatch,ff9ud5k,t3_esgba3,1579721541.0,"Heya. I read it all. I haven't seen all of your posts but from the looks of things, you've been through a lot and you have been improving. The thing about recovery, is that it takes a long time. It involves inevitable bumps and setbacks. I know you're having a hard time right now, from what you've described, and it also sounds like you are having self harm urges too?
I want you to do this exercise with me. Take a breath in for 5 seconds. Okay? Hold it for 5. Annd release it for 5. Repeat it as many times as you need when you get a particularly strong urge. As well as this, I'm happy to listen to you talk if you need it.
You aren't a burden, this behaviour isn't your fault. It's your self sabotage, and the real you doesn't want that, truly.
Im sorry to hear that you think so lowly of yourself, I can list a lot of positive things about you, (and impressive things, I wouldn't be able to stay consistently posting) but I know that just some person listing things won't relieve your feelings. I understand how awful it feels, urges are hard and low self esteems are extremely difficult to live through.
But please, don't do anything you'll regret. The present you might want this, but the future you might want you to live. The future you might want you to realise how much potential you have and that you shouldn't give up.
You can't do it for anyone else, that's not how you beat these things. But, you can do it for yourself, even just the future you.
Im not asking you to not cut, I know firsthand those urges are strong. But I am asking you to carry on talking to people, and to let them in.
There's always going to be a part of you that wants to sabotage parts of your life, but the first step in overcoming that is starting to try and ignore what it says."
TransTryouts,ff9ddrk,t3_er00gr,1579710544.0,"Lance! He's such a funny dude, they're the person who discovered that cats can detect the smell of candyfloss!

Have you heard about Logan? They organised the worlds first hamster Olympics! What a cool dude.

Luka, can I get an autograph? Didn't you hear, he grew his own family of miniature cacti, he's incredible!

Have you seen Victor? They helped me to discover the meaning of life, and also helped Stephen Hawking discover all of the theories of the sucky holes in space by the name of the Black Hole. What a legend!

I wonder what Kion is up to. Yes, that's right, they are probably planning the demise of the evil species by the name of the wasp. His plan consists of collecting all the wasps nests himself, then putting them in his giant rocket, and sending them to his own personal volcano to explode. 

Keith, KEITH? Can anyone help me find Keith? They have got the coolest socks (one stripey and the other has parrots on it) AND he was the first human to slide down Niagra Falls in a blow-up donut.

I'm friends with Elliot! Yes, the very same Elliot who found and tamed a whole bunch of giant snails to do tricks on mini scooters! I agree, he is a man of many talents.

Emile, what can I say? They speak many languages, including English, French, Italian, German, Russian, Spanish, Czech, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, Fijian and Thai. How incredibly talented are they?!! He even taught German to his cat, who (evidenced by his video of the cat meowing HÃ¶lle ja meow (hell yeah meow) that he uploaded) 

Ethan! What a great guy. According to local legend, they were the origin of the 'peanut butter jelly sandwich', which in itself is an excellent achievement that he should be proud of himself for.

Well, if there's something you should know, its that Roman is the kindest man I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. His good looks and quick maths skills, along with his talent at training parrots to swear combine to make the perfect human. How lovely are they?!

Rowan. He's such a fantastic artist that even Mr. Van. Gogh bowed down to him. As well as this, they can also solve a rubiks cube in 0.9817 seconds, a universal record. How can you not love them?!

Oliver! The famous octupus tamer, (aka octupus ollie) and overall nice dude. I personally hope they start to get the recognition they deserve. I also hope to be friends with him for the rest of my life! (and that isn't just for the free visits to his cute octupus friends)

There is no tangible 'worst' or 'best' scenario. Everyone has different situations and no one should compare yours with anyone else's.
The people who like you when you're fake aren't real friends, trust me.

Firstly, I'm glad to hear you can't give up. Im proud of you for not doing that, you're a strong person.
As for the LDR breakup, it's okay to give yourself time to get over that. The end of a relationship is hard, even without depression added in.

Don't be embarrassed about your money, we all make mistakes and it's okay that this happened. It's not ideal, yes, but it can be undone. You can keep earning money to get back to where you were.

About your situation with your grandparents, maybe you could try going for a walk or something every week or so? It could help with getting out of the house a bit more, and fresh air often helps clear my head sometimes."

Another thing I find more helpful is just being there to support me, instead of jumping right in with 'answers' or 'fixes'. In the moment, we can't see what would work or not, and it just makes us feel sometimes that our problems are being played down in a way?
Of course you can offer suggestions, but it's better phrased as 'you could do _____' rather than 'you should do ______'
Just being by her side will make her feel less lonely too, let her know how much she means to you.

Best wishes my friend :)"

Australia. Quite literally on fire at the minute. Some of the worst fires to date, and its not stopping anytime soon. I have a great friend in Australia, and also my uncle lives there. I know just how stressed he is, his letters are slightly disordered and he sometimes forgets to finish a sentence. He's not had to evacuate yet, but he can see the fires across the lake next to his house and I cannot imagine having to go to sleep every night knowing your country is burning. I know just how hard it would be for him to evacuate, too. His wife passed away due to cancer a year or so ago, and that house is where they had a fantastic life together. He doesn't want to leave it all behind, left to burn. Some of the pictures I've seen on reddit recently are absolutely heart breaking. Australians, if you're reading this, you're reading this, you're lovely and stronger than a lot of us, keep fighting and I'll find a few links to donate to help you guys once I've posted this.

Britain. My country. We're in a big political mess aren't we? Mind you, if anyone even remembers brexit with all of the other stuff going on at the moment. I'm not going to delve too deep into my political views, as to not start any arguments, but I honestly think we're all not going to be good after we leave. Johnson has said, 31st of January, I believe? Anyway, the past few years have been nothing but lies and false promises from both sides and I think there's not much of a way out from this point.


America. I don't think I know enough about  'WW3' to point fingers and place the blame of someone. All I know is that 1) some people are just wanting to hate on trump but 2) we don't know exactly what's gone on to cause this mess. I don't support trump in anyway, I just think people are making assumptions without knowing the whole story.

The whole world in general: We are burning. The devastating effects of climate change are going to start hurting us and other species a lot in this next decade.
I know you might think personally you can't do much. And the truth is, you can't on a big scale. However, say, you went to the beach and picked up 5 plastic bottles. Now imagine if, 100 people did that,every day. That's 500 bottles, that aren't going into the ocean/our climate.

Please, let's hold the world together. Let's fix the damage we've caused.

As Albus Dumbledore once said, 'we stand as strong as we are united, and as weak as we are divided'

Im15AndThisIsYeet,fcx9dpi,t1_fcx9bdp,1578056304.0,"Because not every trans person is suicidal. Yes, they likely have a form of GID. But, if they are now happier than any other fighter, why would it matter?"
Im15AndThisIsYeet,fcx9akf,t1_fcx8mvg,1578056218.0,No ones denying that. It's just the way it was implied is what's making some peoples offended. :)
Im15AndThisIsYeet,fcx97cv,t1_fcx95jh,1578056130.0,"'I don't want to be fighting next to a suicidal tranny'
That sounds rather... Negative. Explain that?"
Im15AndThisIsYeet,fcx95ni,t1_fcx908w,1578056084.0,"As someone who is going through a rough time self harm and suicidal thoughts wise, I don't think this is a good comment. Sarcasm and morbid 'humour' is not really the most appropriate to use here. Maybe take a 15 minute break from reddit because I feel this will end in a less-than-happy way."
Im15AndThisIsYeet,fcx902q,t1_fcx8vms,1578055928.0,You bet :]
Im15AndThisIsYeet,fcx8zk6,t1_fcx8vpw,1578055914.0,Isn't it pretty shitty that we have to name a country as 'most accepting'? What are we doing to hurt you? In what way does this affect you? Just genuinely asking since you seem pretty defensive about them not being as capable as the next person.
Im15AndThisIsYeet,fcx8t30,t1_fcx8p8n,1578055731.0,"That's not why people are getting upset. They're getting upset because it seems you're throwing every trans person into the category of 'suicidal' and saying that it is somehow a weakness? Trust me, if you had a mental disorder, I wouldn't just shunt you aside. We need support, not rejection and judgement. Then maybe the suicide rates will decrease?"
Im15AndThisIsYeet,fcx8phb,t1_fcx8kjx,1578055628.0,"Have you ever considered it might be because of the hate they receive? You'd feel like there was no way out too, if you were getting hate for something you couldn't control. I didn't exactly ask to be put through dysphoria or any of that. I can't change who I am, but you can change your attitude. Never judge someone for something that's out of thier control."
Im15AndThisIsYeet,fcx8lc4,t1_fcx8jw2,1578055510.0,Trans army stand up :)
Im15AndThisIsYeet,fcx8ie3,t1_fcx62d0,1578055423.0,"Are you doing okay? If you're not, and this is your way of feeling better, feel free to rant to me in DMs about 'suicidal trannys' so it affects less people. Please think about what you put on the Internet, it hurts."
