So I’m wondering if I maybe pushed myself a bit too much, and didn’t realize that I’d popped my rib out. It just feels so sore that I’m laying down supine, to avoid my ribs being involved. :/

I’ve actually had intermittent right side pain that I thought was my stomach, because of the location; it felt muscular. I saw every doctor known to man and they said it was rather depression or a side effect of my antidepressant (go figure). I’ve since stopped the med and my depression has been largely non existent yet I still get it from time to time. It feels almost like a spasm? 

I think this is actually my ribs - of course I could be wrong, but it doesn’t feel muscular to me at all (I’ve pulled/strained my abs before, this feels so different to me)."

This is why I commented to clarify though. Things can get lost in translation online. :)

I agree though- Ed clinics (and rehabs) profit off your failure, so many of them don’t help clients to cope with their lives without resorting to weight and instead teach them to deludedly ignore it, or act as though “diet talk” won’t be prevalent, which it is.

EDAnonymous,ff2vh8c,t3_er9th5,1579525731.0,"Everybody needs a certain level of attention to sustain themselves - whether it be very little due to growing up in a stable household, or a lot, due to growing up in a malfunctioning one. To call somebody ""attention seeking"" is accurate - because we all seek out attention daily, whether or not we want to admit that.

People often labeled as ""attention seeking"" have simply never learned how to have those needs met in a healthy way, or how to seek them out functionally (something we should learn at home with our familial relationships), and I hate that our society demonizes the people who aren't fortunate enough to learn those things. If our parents were horrific at parenting, that's not our fault, and often times, we're just doing the best we can to get by. There is nothing less valid about somebody who developed struggles, due to growing up in a malfunctioning home, and is just trying to find that care/healthy attention to the best of their ability.

Especially since... well..... look at fucking social media? Lol. It's all ""LOOK AT ME"", in the same fashion, except it's socially acceptable. Of course some people fall outside of the ""norm"" and are outliers - but people don't \[usually\] do this out of boredom, or immaturity. When people are seeking attention in an extreme maladaptive way - like people who claim to have anorexia on pro-and sites for examples and don't have it - it just shows that they are struggling enough to see something like that as a viable option- which is it's own pathology or struggle in and of it's self.

POTS,fer6bbz,t1_fepv0ho,1579350419.0,"From what I know about the diagnostic criterion, it's considered normal ""when standing"" is what the literature says.

I don't know if that's normal or not, as, like I said, I'm not your personal physician! If it's in a hypertension category though, I'd (if I were you) start seeing a doctor about it, to see what I can do to get it down.

I know it's hard to not get caught up in the labels and Googling too - I have a plethora of mental health conditions, and for years was told my EDS, POTS, VVS, etc., were all ""in my head"", so I spent ages and so much lost time trying to frantically figure out what I had. In the end? it only gave me anxiety, and overwhelmed me. So, if I may - perhaps print out the documents you have about this topic, record a few normal measurements for your doctor (laying down, sitting, standing), and then do your best to not think about it until that appointment?

So misinformed people can grab a bag, assume that 2000 calorie bag of skittles is just 300 calories (because one serving is 1/4th of the tiny ass bag), eat the whole thing, then wonder why they are still hungry for more (because ya' know, candy isn't filling or anything but people can still treat themselves).

A few years ago I did PT (when I had the fibromyalgia diagnosis), but they had me mostly stretch so it was the opposite of helpful. They assumed I had fibromyalgia because I was inflexible and de-conditioned- which both were not true at the time.

There's a book I just got, that had a lot of good ideas (it's written by a pilates instructor who has EDS herself, and cites a lot of good information about the sensory systems, proprioception, etc.) for beginner exercises to do, when you just start exercising. I think it was called ""Hypermobility without tears"". I can see if I can find her blog too - she wrote a blog and posted videos (or so the book claims) that explain the information as well!

I think it varies a bit for everybody, depending on the joints involved and how much they can take. & as always - take your time, and listen to your body! If you can find a PT or trainer who is used to working with EDS/hypermobile/etc., clients, it can be a huge asset.

EatingDisorders,feh63hb,t3_ep0sl9,1579109918.0,"I've been vegan for a while - and vegetarian. I remained vegan throughout my relapses, and recoveries. I now am in a pretty healthy place- I workout too, and I'd consider myself largely recovered. I was vegetarian/vegan before developing a restrictive ED, which may be a big part of why it didn't impact my ED recovery.

For me? It was all about a mindset change - about focusing on the cool new things I could try, versus the ones that I was restricted to, as a vegan. For me, dietary restrictions have also been a huge trigger in the past, and I simply expanded my plate, and committed to trying new things, so that it wasn't restrictive.

If you live in an area that is not friendly to vegans, this may be hard. I live in a rather liberal state, and near big cities, where vegan food is common. I am also okay with/have been able to always find the time to cook - so I can't possibly get away with lying to myself and excusing neglecting to eat. If you don't live in an area like this and/or have the ability to cook, it may end very differently. I don't fully understand why too, but it made me feel more connected to, and at ease with my food (being vegan that is). 

If you feel like it may impact your recovery, then do what you can without sacrificing your health. People may disagree (some vegans/vegetarians can be ironically un-sympathetic with people regarding this....), but every little bit counts. If you replace one gallon of milk with almond milk once a week? It helps. If you pass up a burger for a veggie burger, or eggs for tofu once a week? it helps. You don't have to commit to a completely 100% vegan diet, to make a difference. There are also plenty of resources on zero waste, and other lifestyle factors you can change to make a difference. One of those is buying locally too!

Look at it this way - if you don't take care of yourself and address your ED, you'll end up not being able to advocate for the environment, and at worst, contributing to it by ending up binge eating/etc (for me, this is when I make the worst environmental decisions).

I always wish she could physically be here - because in person support is sometimes what we all need. But just having somebody to talk to - who has known you for years - makes a big difference too... and it makes our get togethers feel more like vacation get aways.

fatlogic,fdwgup1,t3_en29tf,1578758535.0,"I agree with it actually - but I think that c**ontext is important here**.

If this were posted on a mental health sub, or such.... I can totally see this being a good thing. Our metabolisms change as we age, so it isn't unheard of to put on a few pounds over the years. So a reminder to not beat yourself up over that? Totally awesome, IMO. However, I feel like the post isn't just talking about accepting a few pounds of weight gain, or the weight gain common with puberty.... and instead are speaking about people who used to be in good shape, or had disordered eating as a teen, and now have a very different type of disordered eating, or don't have any regard for their health at all."

When you read research on harm reduction, there is an overall idea of what does and does not constitute it. The problem is, the majority of that approach is utilized for addiction services, and not other areas.

Also, I’ve been on feedback panda and some people leave downright lies in their signature - that say things like “Please remember to leave a 5-apple review! 5-Apple reviews are what allow me to continue customizing your child’s fun and *so totally* exciting amazing props and lessons”. Or “if I don’t get a 5-apple review, VIPKID will no longer allow me to teach your child”. 

I’m also surprised people leave that in the feedback templates they submit - but I get why people are desperate. So knowing that Karen downright lies and that’s how she gets her 99.9% feedback rate - I stopped feeling bad and it’s what encouraged me to ask."

fatlogic,fdglpbg,t1_fdglbcm,1578401534.0,"It’s always been that way; in the longer in depth description was (and still is) the BMI mention.

There is also a stupid “severity” scale I wish they would get rid of, which uses BMI as a measure of severity as well. 

Atypical anorexia is a diagnosis of anorexia, minus the weight component. Anorexia nervosa is the criterion being met, including the weight component.
