aww,fevnv09,t1_fevi138,1579399510.0,"I had a cat that peed on a former boyfriend of mine. She perched on his knees while he was chilling on my bed. I'd gone downstairs foe a minute and then I heard him yell.

It was a very deliberate act. He's a great person, can't figure out why she hated him, but boy! She did hate."

drugtesthelp,fdopz5c,t1_fdlssay,1578610257.0,"Yeah, it will be the probation officers call to a large degree. I interned at a clinic that had a lot of mandated clients, so saw a lot of permutations of both OP and your situations. Severity of charges, general behavior during probation, and whether or not it was a mental health or drug court sitch played roles too. 

I hope your program doesn't blow chunks."
