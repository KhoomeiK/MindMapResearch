HumansBeingBros,feilbcz,t1_fei35gf,1579141193.0,"To eat spaghetti you just need to fork it, continually spin it in the same place for longer than you think necessary, then finally lift the fork and eat it. Takes practice to get the correct amount on there but where people fail is not spinning it long enough or by moving the fork around the plate as they spin it - effectively undoing the spiraling as you're trying to spiral. If you want spaghetti and meatball in the same bite the proper time is after you've correctly loaded the fork with spaghetti, stab the meatball and proceed to bite. Don't even try to fork the meatball first. Don't even try. If your meatballs are too big, cut one into the right size pieces before you find yourself fumbling around with a fragile forkful of spaghetti with no fork-edge available for cutting."
