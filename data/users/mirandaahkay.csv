Thank you for donating, that 14 year old girl can have a much more normal life now and all out of love for your friend who will also be able to, thanks to you and their donor. I'll never understand how incredible people like you are willing to take that leap of donating an organ but it's just amazing. My life changed about 5 months ago because my cousin gave me the gift of life and it's such a difference from being on dialysis. Truly thank you to you and every single awesome, completely selfless person that does this 🙏🙏"
fatlogic,fcn5gop,t3_ehv5cd,1577803776.0,"Your ""diet"" is the way you eat. Any way that you eat is a diet. You can have a bad diet, or you can have a good diet, or you can have an ok diet. I really don't understand why ""diet"" is such an evil word to these people."
TooAfraidToAsk,fc3omg4,t1_fbywprb,1577394755.0,Thank you for all that you do and for being an organ donor.
TooAfraidToAsk,fc2n4te,t1_fc29svy,1577367787.0,"It reveals that you both associate this behavior with women because of your own experience. And to be fair it is how media portrays women to be towards each other and men are not as often shown this way in TV situations. So there might be some truth in that you're subconsciously focusing on seeing this behavior from women you see or know but not from men because you don't inherently associate that behavior with men. I just think men and women are different in the way they will go about exhibiting their assholeness. Cause in either case, it really is just a person being an ass. Not every woman is like this and not every man is NOT like this, just like any situation that you ever hear being gendered."
