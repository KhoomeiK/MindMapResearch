facepalm,fguegrp,t1_fgtkgpo,1581118815.0,"You know, this point is stupid (I obviously don't have the space, funds, equipment, nor expertise to care for sheep), but I will say that my view has slightly evolved. I don't think of it as slavery, necessarily, because sheep can be comfortable in captivity in a way that humans can't. What really matters, though, is that the person Gooby replied to has a legitimate opinion. I can easily see why some people think it's slavery, since one party is forced to stay on a farm and produce something that another party profits off of, and the one making it is paid only in food and shelter that they never asked for in the first place.

On one hand, sheep are incapable of understanding the situation, and giving them money would be stupid. If they can't/don't care about what the farmers do with their wool, then by all means let the farmers sell it. As far as the sheep can tell, it's a symbiotic relationship.

On the other hand, just because an animal can't understand consent or contracts doesn't mean we they don't deserve our moral consideration. I don't care if they keep shearing sheep, but keeping them in poor conditions and breeding them to make too much wool changes it from a symbiotic relationship to a parasitic one. Humans are actively hurting sheep in order to squeeze more money out of them."
3Dprinting,fgtzgwu,t3_f0adi4,1581111339.0,"Check that your extruder is actually pushing filament through. Get the nozzle up to a few degrees hotter than you normally print, so that filament flows easily. Then open the menu on the printer, select Prepare>Move Axis>1 mm>Extruder, and extrude 20-30 mm.

Take a look at your extruder when you do that. If the gear is clicking, then there's definitely a clog. If the gear isn't clicking, but it's rotating without constantly pushing filament, then there's not enough tension holding the filament to the gear.

If it's smoothly going in with no problems whatsoever, then at least you know it's not the extruder."
facepalm,fgtrzus,t1_fgt9g5n,1581108530.0,"The alternatives for those animals all include euthanasia anyway. Either they go to a different kill shelter, or go back on the street, get recaptured, and then taken to a kill shelter.

That's not including pet owners who can't afford to have their pets put down by a vet, and so sign their pets over to PETA so that they can do it for free.

PETA doesn't use those shelters as actual shelters because there are *enough shelters nearby.* They euthanize animals that other shelters won't take."
facepalm,fgtk6b9,t1_fgt5qez,1581105561.0,"Fuck off with that propaganda bullshit. The ""Center for Consumer Freedom"" is funded by animal agriculture industries. Without even reading the list, I can tell you that they're A) leaving out crucial information, or B) showing you allegations that have been made with absolutely no evidence.

1: PETA's animal shelter mainly euthanizes animals that A) are relinquished by their owners specifically to be euthanized, because the owners can't afford to have it done at a vert, or B) are turned away from local ""no-kill"" shelters.

2: I can believe that they're against seeing eye dogs, because they're against the exploitation of animals. I don't agree with it, but it's not hard to believe. What *is* hard to believe is that they had someone's dog taken away from them. I can find literally nothing about that. CCF are allowed to report it, though, because ""we're not alleging that it happened, we're just saying that someone wrote it.""

3: They donated money to certain animal rights groups, which later committed crimes, and then didn't get money from PETA anymore. Ok. Also, PETA wasn't happy with the guy who talked about smashing windows and blowing stuff up.

4: At best, this is misrepresenting PETA's views. They're actually all for responsible feral cat colonies. They mainly say that cats with FIV or leukemia should be isolated from other cats, or euthanized, so as to prevent the spread of these illnesses to *your* cats.

5: Finally a point I agree with. Targeting children with violent imagery is not ok. They should be targeting *adults* with violent imagery of the animals they're exploiting.

6: So am I. If humans are going to be the end user of medical treatments, then those treatments should be tested on consenting humans.

7: So fuckin what? The only part here that *kind of* bothers me is comparisons to the Holocaust; but if you've ever seen a slaughterhouse, and considered the fact that each and every animal in there was a unique individual with their own life and personality, then maybe you wouldn't be so angry at the comparison.

8: This could be a list of its own, but I think it can be boiled down to this: not everyone who supports PETA shares all of their moral beliefs, and PETA is okay with that. **Also, the CCF outright fucking lied about Morrissey eating at a steakhouse.** He didn't eat at a steakhouse. Even if he *had,* I've eaten at steakhouses despite being vegetarian. The trick is to *not order meat.*

That's 40 minutes of my life that I'm not getting back, and you probably already saw the comment before I edited this."
