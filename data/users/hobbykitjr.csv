newjersey,fekrcwo,t1_fekr1eg,1579206017.0,"> Banning flavored juices does nothing but encourage more black-market juice/ cart makers to make more in profits, and of course helping the tobacco industry get more money out of selling literal cancer sticks.

as i said in my other reply, my step sister in law (who hated cigs from her chain smoking parents) started smoking cigs w/ berry vapes as her gateway

""it smelled nice and looked cool"" so she started doing it too thinking it was harmless and is now smoking cigs.

so there is a down side to this, and they DO market vapes at younger, naive kids. I just think people were too relaxed about it all since they're supposed to be harmless (what the marketing says)"

I think they do look at cost, but the do a lot of data research. Books, and topics and characters and actors, comedians and directors.

e.g. ""our customers X, has % millennial black males... This comedian is really popular with this percent which equals this $. We can spend %$ on this comedian""

newjersey,fekqn3m,t1_fekpvlv,1579205595.0,"so if there is a market for it, then i guess just focus on the kids part.

They went hard on it being harmless, but 1) its not 2)Nicotine addiction. we need to be stricter about who/how well sell it. 

My sister in law swore against cigs her whole life (since her parents are chain smokers), smokes cigarettes now but started on vaping.... it was easy, all the kids were doing it, and flavorful/""cool"" and the nicotine addiction kicked in and cigs were easier a lot of the time.

so i know of at least 1 person it went backwards on ""helping people quit"" argument. But still, adults have the right to mess themselves up i guess."

They're very up front, and its simple. Costs X to make, Y Subscribers watch it. is it a profit?

Doesn't matter how good or bad it is, or if it had a cult following (Sense 8, A.O.) too expensive and too little watched it.

or a cheap gameshow/cooking show that little watched but cost nothing? Junk by our standards but someones watching and paying for it."
