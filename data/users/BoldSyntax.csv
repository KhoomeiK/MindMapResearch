Now you're just making things up. The constitution determines how many seats each province gets. To change that, we'd need to amend the constitution, which the PM can't do ""unilaterally"".

Eh... sorta. I have a wife and son who I love dearly, and that's a good place to be. But it's not a thing where it was years ago and I've gone on to make way or money, or got past the ramifications of it.

I still struggle with seeing myself as valuable, having been told by my former employer that I'm not.

I don't want to pretend that that incident alone caused me to lose my job. There are people in the job I was doing who make enough sales that they can do the right thing in that situation, lose the sale, and still hit their sales targets. If I was better at the job, it wouldn't have been an issue. But I also know that there were a half dozen times, in my last year with the company, which were similar to that; where I lost sales revenue, because I put my customer's interests ahead of making the sale. And I'm 100% sure that, if I'd taken those sales, I'd still have that job. I'm also 100% sure that there are people in that job who screw over their customers to make a sale, because that's the difference between keeping their job or not."

I ended up telling him that our wiring system was down and he'd have to come back another day. Then I called his kids, who talked him down.
