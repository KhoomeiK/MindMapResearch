TumblrInAction,ffbcwg1,t3_esnjln,1579760055.0,"Like there's nothing wrong with wanting to be a stay at home wife/mom/spouse, but ""tradwife"" is a term used in *a lot* of white supremacy groups, I think that's what she's getting the race part from."
Sims4,ff9awbx,t3_esck7l,1579708798.0,I think that would be cool. I've really missed the graveyards from sims 3.

writing,ff8c5v0,t3_es63b9,1579672555.0,"Dude, I would ask if you're me but I'm not a healthcare worker. I was in the exact mindset f or a long time, event went as so far as to delete everything I ever wrote. But I picked it up again because I just couldn't stop. 

If it makes you even a little happy, it's worth it. It sounds like you're in a bad depression right now and pushing away from something that you love isn't going to help. I really hope things start getting better for you.

(If it means anything, I have a similar way of writing with one central character as a way of working through things, and I have a few friends that do that too.)"

I was goin to say ""me"" but my house is a disaster, I can't sneeze without leaking, I don't have a figure, my skin care routine is meh, and I got denied for disability because I made too much money last year lmao"

winxclub,feyok6d,t3_equ1v5,1579448344.0,"If it was a different show, it would be fine (except the specialists they look 12). But the Winx style was so stylized and iconic to them, you could look at any background character and tell what show it was from."

writing,fcapfey,t3_egwx82,1577573935.0,"Depends on what you're going for. A delicate or cute fat character could be called ""plump"", a tougher fat character might be ""hefty"". Also, I'm a hella fat woman and I wouldn't mind a character being described as fat if it isn't used as a negative or positive trait, just a trait."

childfree,fc4j4it,t3_efumqo,1577418154.0,"Y'all I can understand some leniency for children, but excessive noise shouldn't be okay. I have a concussion and loud/high pitched noises really set me off. Lack of sleep also triggers my anxiety really bad, makes me wonder if a parent could be liable if lack of sleep due to a child caused someone like me to get an injury or lose a job or something. Probably not but just thinking."
