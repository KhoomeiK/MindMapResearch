To use an analogy one might say who can screw up selling groceries. Everyone needs them without choice. And it might seem simple buying at a small farmers market. But the behind the scenes that's supplies our stores is anything but simple.

The crucial lack of experience is governmental though. Things are in part a general shit show because we are one of the first nations to properly legalize on such scale.

WorldOfWarships,fez3a2s,t1_feyyb90,1579453491.0,"I get your point and technically you are correct. A round of larger diameter that is the same weight as a smaller shell would penetrate worse (assuming similar head shape).

However there is a major factor to consider, which is weight change with respect to size change.

A larger shell is both longer and wider giving it more weight. Additionally as you increase diameter linearly you increase weight non-linearly. So the gain from a larger shell is much greater.

Another thing to consider is shell front. A smaller shell does mean a smaller impact site yes, creating a greater effect. However with the pointed shape of the shell that effect is lessened. By the time the round has reached the extra surface area penetration has already been decided, it's either in or it's not.

However here the larger shell as an advantage too. At the point of impact all its mass is still being concentrated at that same sized point. So it has a better chance of initially piercing.

Finally the smaller shell, because its ratio of mass to front surface area is lower slows more through the air with drag. Drag is also a square of speed, meaning that to get the small shell to go faster on impact you need it significantly fast when it exists the barrel.

Anyways that's about it. Point is technically yes, but because of other factors the advantage isnt great enough"

funny,fekd9sq,t1_fejrznz,1579197630.0,"At a guess I'm going with you being a local rather than a queens student given your opinions here.

Are there big issues yes but dont exaggerate. A big area of the downtown is not taken over, one street 2 blocks long in the student ghetto is. The student ghetto where basically only students live. 

The university does take responsibility as it can, bad behaviour can get you citations and disciplinary action taken by the university. It also contribute a few hundred thousand to the police budget each year to help with costs of not just homecoming but students through the year. But they cant do anything about some of the biggest assholes, those visiting just to party.

The divide isnt helped by either party. A group of students are assholes who cause legitimate problems for locals each year. A group of locals seems unhappy with anything other than the university just cancelling homecoming which is pissing off the larger student body. And it is going to get worse I think.

And I should be clear just because I'm talking about exxagerationa does not mean I dont get where you are coming from. For example people who host parties on the periphery of the ghetto really shouldnt that's impacting normal people. Contain it to aberdeen."

Highly skilled driver but incredibly damaging to team cohesion when things arent going well. His impact on the team makes recovery harder, it was similar with his time at ferrari.

todayilearned,fejrfdl,t1_fejlkc9,1579183977.0,"They were ignored for a while but this is more a factor of not being ignored, but in a good way.

A first it lasted because they were ignored more in the assimilation drives. However a couple decades ago the Canadian government signed what is probably the largest treaty in the world, creating the territory of Nunavut. The territory is under it's own governance for the most part, with an official language of Inuktitut. So the language still gets taught in some schools there, sees common use etc."
