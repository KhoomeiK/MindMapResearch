I know many alcoholics who are great fathers, co workers and leaders but they drink. So is this mindset such that, if you label yourself an, â€œalcoholicâ€, you canâ€™t be respected, productive or capable of raising children?"

I humbly welcome you to the greatest distraction, (aside from porn), on the internet, (Reddit). Guilt is a bitch. So is the feeling of being trapped. You have fair points. I think people take relationships too lightly in general and idealize what is â€œa perfect relationshipâ€ vs what is, someone who loves you that you love back and takes work, compromise and effort. IMO, Honey moon period dies off after a couple years..then itâ€™s more of a partnership with sprinkles of love and affection when there is time to do so. Loneliness is better than chaos and strife. Put yourself out there though. Give it the ole college try. Life is a series of moments, capture the happy ones."

Unexpected,fdp6qk9,t1_fdos0j9,1578621297.0,"Maybe the person helped you through a rough time and has brought legitimacy and stability to your life. Over years you have made something of yourself and have progressed and are now self sufficient. In that time you have grown to want more whilst this person who made such an immense difference is happy just being with you and complacent. Do you leave them because they are no longer in line with your forward moving goals that were essentially cultivated by said person you are questioning. Or do you work with them to reach common ground?

You fall in love with your best friend ata a young age. Sheâ€™s beautiful, exciting and wholesome-everything you dreamed of. You have a kid together, house, white picket fence.  Before you know it, youâ€™re 30 years old working a job you donâ€™t want to work to make ends meet, living a very typical lifestyle, 40hours a week, kid is in school doing well, wife has a successful job, go on vacations a couple times a year etc. One day You realize you never actually gave yourself a chance to explore life and experience things. Career goals have been passed up because you canâ€™t move your family away from relatives, you have no free time, your life pretty much consists of work and family time. Youâ€™re not happy, though youâ€™ll find happiness in moments and in your childâ€™s and wives success, but for yourself, happiness is mainly fleeting. This will be your life until youâ€™re old and grey. Do you leave?

Youâ€™re in love with a girl. You canâ€™t stand the relationship or the way things always seem to go when youâ€™re together, but you love her and canâ€™t help that fact. She uses you, she takes advantage, but she is kind and she makes up your other half, that gaping hole we all try so hard to fill despite reality. Things are dysfunctional but for as many bad moments, there are good moments. Do you risk leaving?

Few examples lol. Sorry Iâ€™m on mobile and just got off work so phrasing may be off, ideas not formed fully but my point is, shit gets complicated. Quick."
