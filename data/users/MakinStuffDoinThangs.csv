AskReddit,fem71fk,t3_epp36x,1579242049.0,"A laptop (mine died), a yarn swift, a yarn winder, yarn, some accessories (stitch markers, yarn needles), and some new patterns.

The laptop will help with writing patterns and also using the new patterns as well as looking up new techniques and basically all the things that can be done so much easier on a laptop than a phone. 

The yarn swift and winder will help keep things better organized (skeins tend to get tangled upon themselves).

More yarn as it is the basic necessity of crochet and I don't currently have a ton. It'll help to be able to work more expressively.

New patterns because that's how I learn new techniques for the most part."

fatlogic,fcnuj03,t1_fcnt17l,1577818689.0,"Very true. But that wasn't the battle I was fighting with my mother. She didn't actually want to die, she just had blinders on and refused to acknowledge the reality she was creating for herself. 

So I took every opportunity to tell her the truth: she was killing herself. If she were suicidal or something like that, I would've handled it in an entirely different way."
fatlogic,fcngwne,t1_fcmxr9i,1577811462.0,"It really doesn't. In my case it took a long time. Long enough that I'd actually given up and thought she was just going to die from it. I kept nagging her and refusing to make it easy but I genuinely thought that she was going to eat herself to death.

It's not going to be nice and they won't like it. They'll make you feel badly and act like you soon love them. Just remember that the most loving thing you can do for someone is call them out on their shit and tell them that you won't sit back in silence as they kill themselves. 

My mom's never thanked me for not enabling her like everyone else. She has, however, told me that I was 'evil' when I refused to give her a slice of my son's birthday cake or asked her if her doctor knew how many refined carbs she are. In the end, it only bugs me a little that she appears to think my behavior was less loving than those who would give her a slice of pecan pie without blinking. But at least she's still alive."
fatlogic,fcngakf,t1_fcmyguy,1577811105.0,"I'm actually not sure I made any difference at all. It was a *long* time. She mainly got angry with me, ignored me, and sometimes cried but just kept eating like crap.

She claimed her doctor said it was okay and got angry when I suggested I go talk to him about what she was actually eating. She got my siblings and dad to yell at me to leave her alone (all enablers of that behavior). I mean, it was a constant struggle. 

Then one day she started asking for smaller portions and putting the rest in the fridge. She cut back pretty much everywhere. I have no idea what the tipping point was actually. I just couldn't sit in silence and watch my mom kill herself because it was easier than fighting."

fatlogic,fcmvj2p,t1_fcm3pic,1577794235.0,"I started staring my mother in the eye and telling her how selfish she was to choose to die early and leave her grandchildren. She cried. I said it in front of them a couple times. Then she got her shit together.

My justification is they were watching her kill herself, surely they didn't need to be protected from hearing about it. She's lost a crap ton of weight from her hard work now and is looking great and the healthiest she's been in years. 

Sometimes being cruel is the only option. Any time she ate something bad, I made a point to go on about how she was choosing to kill herself. I screamed at her. I ignored her. Refused to serve her whatever it was she wanted some of. I talked about her losing pieces of herself until she eventually died from it. Pretty sure she hated me for awhile there (and maybe still does a little).

But eventually she chose to change and it's amazing. She's still losing weight, none of her old clothes fit, her diabetes is under control and her numbers are the best they've been in years. They have to want it themselves but no one says you can't (or shouldn't) make it uncomfortable as hell until they choose that path."

Sybil

Edith doesn't even rank.

Mary was kind hearted to everyone who deserved it. Carson, Tom, Thomas, Anna. She wasn't a bigot. She wasn't a hypocrite. She didn't live with rose colored glasses but simply saw the world for what it was and tried to make the best of it.

She refused to cheat with boring guy (unlike someone else who just swallowed dude's story about his 'insane' wife in a time when women could be institutionalized based on a man's word alone). She always cared about the staff and the people in town.

Was she a little self centered? Sure. But even with growing up in a universe where everyone thought the moon rose and set on her, she still managed to care.

DowntonAbbey,fcmtc5f,t1_fcfny5r,1577791274.0,"There we go. This is the list I was scrolling for. 

Edith was horrific. In addition to everything else horrible, she was willing to cut off her nose to spite her face. She'd have damaged her reputation and the reputation of Sybil (who had no skin in their spat) as well by proxy with her idiotic move.

Let's remember she also ruined the lives of two families while trying to hide her shame. And was still busy passing judgment while pregnant with her married boyfriend's baby ('Granny, is it right? In regards to the singer Rose brought).

Mr. Green was a serial rapist, Pamuk... The more I rewatch the more I become unsure of how much actual consent happened there. 

Basically everyone on your list was spot on. Edna was an idiot as well as if her plan had worked out, both she and Tom would've been out. 

Daisy annoyed the every loving shit out of me but I empathize with Mary and think she gets a bad rap. And Cora married a man less than her in every way beyond title who didn't love her only for him to treat her like an infant while tossing her money to the wind."

There are a few people I still gift items to because they honestly appreciate them and understand the work behind it.

I highly recommend stopping the gifts. You can give to charities or friends to get that nice feeling of giving. Then just buy whatever gift you give family.

You could also just buy your mom a gift and then bring a dish or whatever. If she asks about it, tell her you had to cut a gift out to make time to make the food she wanted you to bring."
AmItheAsshole,fbqp2m4,t3_ee0967,1577033856.0,"Yta. You were strict on sex so your daughter was likely not given baby preventing options, and now she's having one and you're what? Strict on the end result of your lack of educating her?

But none of that matters. She needs a job and healthcare, stat. I see no mention of you caring about that. Get her on Medicaid. Lay out some responsibilities. Help her form a plan to get her own place. Find a childcare place and get her on the waiting list. Every step of the way, she needs to do most of the legwork. But stand over her and make her do it.

She's pregnant. She likely doesn't feel well healthwise. Keep that in mind. 

Also, get a dna test (I've heard the new ones can be done during pregnancy with just a spit test so no risk to baby) and file for child support. It'll likely be nothing since he's a child but that doesn't matter. Dude can't just flake cuz his parents don't want him having a baby. Make him (them, depending on local laws) responsible.

Since you can't help her financially, it is imperative that she find a job and a place to live asap. At her age, that probably means multiple jobs in order to afford to live. 9 months goes by quickly and you don't even seem to know how far along she is right now..."
