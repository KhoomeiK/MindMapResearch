reactiongifs,ffi7y1k,t1_ffi7t4x,1579967430.0,You're the one that's missing the point. You're getting all defensive about a post that's supposed to be someone subconsciously cheering someone else on.
reactiongifs,ffi712e,t1_ffi6mtq,1579966773.0,"Not every encouraging thought is self congratulatory, especially when you're keeping it to yourself. But if you want people to subconsciously root against you, you're doing a good job making the case."
reactiongifs,ffi5v3v,t1_ffi4nl5,1579965897.0,I doubt OP actually stares and shakes his fist at fat people. I took it as just mentally cheering them on.

TumblrInAction,ffdq6te,t1_ffdq0e3,1579826309.0,"It's your personal character that makes you a parasite. And yes, you are a criminal. Why should you be able to make excuses for your past when you use it to demean others. You're a criminal, and a parasite."
TumblrInAction,ffdpx56,t1_ffdmqkr,1579826140.0,You literally are a parasitic criminal
lansing,ffdpdfq,t1_ffdp6z4,1579825796.0,"Honestly yes, it's incredible. You've gotta put in the order ahead of time though. They'll put something out on social in February about placing an order."

TumblrInAction,ffdglu2,t1_ffdgctr,1579820437.0,"
What you mean is you don't have the guts to be mean in real life because you have to look people in the face instead of hiding behind a screen. There's a difference between that and being kind."
TumblrInAction,ffdgcjz,t1_ffdg6p9,1579820289.0,I agree with your motive but not your tactic
TumblrInAction,ffdf132,t1_ffdemms,1579819505.0,And you're a traitor to yourself by finding people to blame for your own situation instead of trying to look inward. If it smells like shit wherever you go look under your own shoe.

3. Acts like other people are the retarded ones.

Get a trade job. They're everywhere and will train you. Then work on your bitterness. You're fetishising your own misery."
TumblrInAction,ffddrfs,t1_ffd5jkz,1579818747.0,"Everybody is a person. Yeah this guy is foolish, but the best we can do is try to talk sense to someone like him. Encouraging them to kill themselves just spreads misery."
TumblrInAction,ffdcyny,t1_ffdcqwh,1579818257.0,"The way you're approaching happiness is what's stupid. You're clearly bitter and resent other people for having what you want, and you're taking it out on them. You also clearly have some skeletons in your closet. I suggest taking a look at yourself, fixing your faults, and celebrate other people's happiness. Then happiness will come to you."
TumblrInAction,ffdbazn,t1_ffd3g7s,1579817185.0,Maybe part of the reason nobody wants to love and accept you is because you constantly dwell on what other people have and what you think you're entitled to.
TumblrInAction,ffdb3nw,t1_ffd7slk,1579817048.0,"Yeah, it's been rough. Years ago it was just a laugh at some of the more ridiculous stuff and now it's just a bunch of neckbeards with victim complexes. Yeesh."

todayilearned,ff5y8xv,t1_ff5t312,1579614137.0,You're telling me. I woke up the week of Christmas feeling like I was karate chopped in the throat and there was a lump in my neck. Went to the doctor and did bloodwork and I'm hyperthyroid. Now the lump has moved to the other side of my throat?? I get scans on Thursday. Stupid thyroids.
cringe,fez2b6u,t1_fewfjlt,1579453192.0,"Except it's never constructive. As someone who was bullied terribly and is a pretty well rounded person today, it doesn't help. It just makes you hate yourself."
nfl,fevlyko,t1_feviz27,1579398915.0,"I totally get it, I like soccer too. What I was trying to point out (and maybe failed to do so adequately) was that these guys wanted to shit on sports but would praise soccer just because it made them feel cultured."

TumblrInAction,febxdct,t1_fe94ms5,1578963848.0,I believe that toxic masculinity the person in the post is referencing is exactly what you're talking about. Men are victims of the unhealthy cultural expectations put upon them just as much as women are. That person just did a shit job articulating herself.

He signed legislation that allows the indefinite detention of designated terrorists, even if they are American citizens. In fact, the legalisation originally had a provision saying that it didn't apply to citizens but it was removed.
