LatinoPeopleTwitter,ffaxom8,t1_ffado96,1579746899.0,"I mean I'm from California and I don't really feel there's much of a strong cultural identity. It's really only if you're Mexican, the rest of us sort of get lumped into ""other"" (which kind of makes sense, with Mexico being our neighbor and them being the largest ethnic group). 


I now live on the east coast of the US where there are hardly any Mexicans but lots of Central Americans; they're really nice but don't seem to lump themselves together, considering there's several small countries making up that region, and would probably find it rude if someone assumed they're mexican. 


But yeah overall the US is a little race obsessed; sometimes it can make us stronger but it can also be harmful at times"

I later moved to rural Maryland with a friend after we dropped out of college in CA (weird, but I later moved back and now have graduated and work professionally haha), and they lived in this huuuge house in the middle of nowhere and never locked the doors. It gave me the creeps.



I had also just read Truman Capotes In Cold Blood so I was super paranoid men were going to do the exact same thing decades later. My understanding is they knew all their neighbors so felt safe, but I always worried about ""outsiders"" preying on some random wealthy community that naive enough to think they didn't need locks. 


Now I live in Washington DC and some dude broke into my neighbors townhouse because the door was accidentally left open by a construction worker working on the house; and we also have footage of someone else (or same guy) trying to open one of the front windows on our row house before giving up because we lock everything.

I think NA here-- OP just wanted his fake Internet points. This is such a non-issue; I question if this was even an argument or if OP had to write this to appear as more of a conflict than it really is haha. 


I mean, both seem like they have a point. It definitely can be a red flag if someone has no social media, especially if you're trying to date that person. And OP definitely has a right to not want to date people that are offended or worried about his lack of social media. There's not exactly a moral quandary here"

startrek,fcnj0fg,t3_ei4813,1577812633.0,"I really like the characters in DS9 much more. As a woman I'll admit after a while I got tired of all the space romp arcs in TNG; while fun the first few times, it got repetitive that Riker kept getting laid in space and somehow that was worth an episode haha. I'll admit that sometimes DS9 can drag, but I feel it's more about social relationships and the interactions between the core groups (Star fleet, Bajor, Cardassia) and the complexities of working with people with different and at times conflicting backgrounds or cultures. Some people may find that interesting, some may wonder why that's a focal point of a series. 


But it can come across as a lot less action than TNG, which I can see as being taken as boring. Ultimately it's your call, though I agree that the first season isn't the best to judge it by. They're totally different shows in my opinion, and it's a bit unfair to try to compare them. 


On another note, I peeked ahead and decided to give Voyager a try and found it boring. So maybe I'm missing somewhere there too!"

books,fcnhdu8,t3_ei4kbu,1577811745.0,"I agree with someone's suggestion to underline or note somehow (if it's a book you can't mark in) words you don't understand.

I like to read newspapers articles, highlight the words I don't know, and translate them, so I continue to grow my vocabulary while not reading ""baby"" stuff that's too easy. 


Or if you feel you know all words in English and aren't needing to learn vocabulary, maybe do the same thing but with the format of sentences, the way words are used, etc. I certainly don't speak German but I imagine there may be some differences, big or small, in how we structure our sentences or speak.

I have a funny story that's the oposite of yours: at my previous apartment I lived next to this really nice guy (whose name I did know). I have a name that's typically a boys name, and somehow he got it confused with another ""gender neutral"" boys name, and started calling me that. At first I thought it was maybe a one time thing, but somehow between having really brief interactions and feeling bad, i let it go on sooo long, it was bordering on a year, and i just couldn't bring myself to admit to him I'd been letting him call me by the wrong name that whole time haha!
