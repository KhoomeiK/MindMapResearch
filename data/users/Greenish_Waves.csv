Utrecht,fea33s9,t3_eo8ems,1578943863.0,"Ik woon ook sinds Ã©Ã©n jaar in Kanaleneiland. Ik heb nog geen problemen gehad.
Als ik het met de centrum van Utrecht vergelijk, dan zal ik zeggen dat in hier minder mensen Engels kunnen praten. Omdat mijn gesproken Nederlands nog niet perfect is, is dat soms een beetje lastig.
Maar ik vind het hier heel leuk."

You hopefully find the strength to do more steps, baby steps if it helps :-)

Of course there is nothing a stranger on the internet can do to really help, but maybe you find strength in the thought that had helped me sometimes

All the best to you"

I moved a lot the last year's and felt like loosing my social net 'n stuff to a point where I felt this consuming lonelyness.
But! I could find some nice groups via meetup.
Maybe this is an option for you, too?
You can bond over interests, so there is a guaranteed topic to talk about and there a no social obligations to stay.

I hope you will find your way it of this situation!
You can do it!"

insanepeoplefacebook,fcq3vr2,t1_fcpyj8m,1577878164.0,"Most of the skills we learn at school are more a train-the-brain type of thing.
By learning how to analyse a text in different ways, we also learn how to really read a text and express ourselves. This is not only handy on the job market, but in far more parts of life, as a lot of information is transferred in a language related way.
By learning vector analysis or any other math related thing we train our abstract thinking skills and our problem solving gets better.
At least that's what the German school system is aiming at \ _ ( Â° _ â€¢ ) _ /

I just realized, that I never ""pulled the partner card"", because I was always in homosexual relationships when I got approached like that. Mentioning my partner then always lead to a different kind of disgusting conversation.

I guess you are right and everybody uses what works best for them then \_(-_  -)_ /

Lots of girl/women answer to this kind of ""requests"" with the fact that their boyfriend/partner wouldn't like it. I'm also pretty sure, that it is safe to assume, that most also would not send those pictures/information/whatev's if they were single.

I kind of understand, that mentioning a boyfriend/partner might help to put some of those creeps off.
( may it be because they value faithfulness or because they respect other men)
It still annoys me*!
Why not just stand by ""No, I don't want to do this, for reasons that are not your business""?

* probably more than it should, because it has absolutely no effect on my life and everybody should cope with stuff like this however they want"
