Shoestring,fdkwlnt,t1_fdiy92m,1578512660.0,Biloxi/Gulfport area. The water is fine to swim. During the summer the beaches were closed due to high levels of bacteria that was caused by the opening of the Bonne Carre Spillway. For now the spillway is closed and the waters have returned to normal. We have barrier islands about 10 miles south of the coast that are lovely to visit this time of year. There is a ferry boat.
