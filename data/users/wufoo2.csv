If the instruction sheets are missing, you can probably download them online.

If the gas has been turned off, you may have to be patient during the lighting process, as air will be in the lines instead of gas.

Newer gas stoves have electric pilots. Older ones will have to be lit manually.

Most modern appliances are foolproof, with check valves and other safety measures to prevent you from making mistakes that would be catastrophic.

You should, however never ignore the smell of a gas leak."

pics,fd51n7u,t1_fd2u8mm,1578173343.0,"The world has always been a ""dangerous place"" because ""Strongman Rule"" has been the standard form of government for most of human existence.

Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi was no worse than most other Middle East strongmen throughout history. They have existed because the region has no tradition of elections and peaceful transfer of power.

The people in that area generally follow their strongman, whoever he may be. Those who don't get in line get mistreated, disappeared, killed. This is how the world has worked for the most part, for most of its existence.

The U.S. leads the planet in free elections and peaceful transfers of power. This is why people line up for days at U.S. embassies and consulates hoping for a chance to get a visa when they are made available. They want to live free of strongmen.

It is unfortunate that they can't bring these values to their own countries, where most people would like to remain if they could have even half the freedoms they enjoy in the U.S.

To answer your closing question: The U.S. does indeed make the ""world a more dangerous place"" because it demonstrates that democracy and freedom are possible. This causes unrest among the not-free peoples, and crackdowns by their strongmen. Dangerous, indeed. Perhaps we should all live under strongmen, where we are safe from temptations toward freedom."
