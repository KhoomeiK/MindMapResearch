I’ve thought about the fountain thing to make sure he gets enough water, I heard cats like to drink from flowing water more than still so it’s something for em to look into."

My friend had an account she opened as a minor and she had a few thousand dollars in it...until one day it all vanished because her parents weren’t handling their money well and were going bankrupt. Creditors came after her parents assets and that included her account, because her parents were on it. She was unable to get any of it back."
teefies,fgl0sd1,t1_fgl08xa,1580878538.0,Haha you never have to apologize for rambling about cats to me! I spent fifteen minutes trading cat stories with a customer at work the other day. Getting paid to tell someone about how my cat will refuse to drink fresh clean water from his bowl in favor of licking condensation off the deck window was a good shift lol!

TheDragonPrince,fggz4vb,t1_fggyj21,1580772857.0,"Your example was bad and you should feel bad. /futurama

They’re not really similar, and I’m not arguing that dark magic is always inherently bad. Just that your example of killing a deer to cure a non-life threatening condition (Soren’s paralysis) isn’t comparable to killing a deer for meat to survive. 

Killing for food = necessary

Killing for convenience = not really necessary"
TheDragonPrince,fggy2p8,t1_fggxj0e,1580772151.0,"But OP wasn’t really talking about balance or improving quality of life. They made a direct comparison of needing food to survive and using dark magic/sacrificing a deer to heal a non-life threatening injury. 

I agree that overall, sacrificing the deer so that Soren could be healed isn’t by itself an evil act. My little brother broke his back (thank god there wasn’t lasting severe damage) but if I thought I could fix him, I think I’d do the same thing she did. 

But it’s *not* the same as eating for survival. Soren would have lived without her intervention. Survival and convenience/QoL are different."
TheDragonPrince,fggwvtc,t3_eycvgq,1580771370.0,"Not really. Soren wasn’t dying, he was paralyzed. You can be paralyzed and live, you cannot survive without food."

I was naive and foolish and didn’t really believe people were shipping a rabbit and a fox as actual lovers and so I went down the rabbit hole (*hah!*) and oh dear  gods I found so many awful things. 

But yeah that’s the tiger. He looks like he’d be amazing in bed and when you get out of the shower afterwards he’d surprise you with fresh pancakes and your favorite tea."

I absolutely should have, too, because the USPS didn’t deliver like half of them. Thank god it was a smallish wedding so it wasn’t too hard to contact people but it really soured me on our postal system. I’m sure there’s good and hardworking ones in there but my personal experience is that USPS blows chunks."

legaladvice,fge32l0,t1_fgdter1,1580690237.0,"What about a camera to watch the postbox? Like from your driveway or house or something like Ring. Have someone send you a card or small package with nothing valuable in it, and record when it should arrive. Maybe you can show the post master the video, figure which carrier on your route is refusing to do their job and now you have a paper trail and the video to back you up. 

Might get you taken more seriously but without you missing work or family time on stakeout."

justneckbeardthings,fg5s6rt,t1_fg5qyzn,1580536896.0,"Unfortunately. STL used to be a *huge* player in the brick industry (lots of clay in the area) and it was a heavily used building material. Bricks are hella expensive to buy or make now, and there’s so many abandoned or damaged homes that are never going to be fixed up or lived in. People will demo them over night for brick theft. Sometimes they set fires and just let the building burn cause it weakens the mortar and makes it easier to get the bricks out in one piece. 

It’s really a shame because we had/have some absolutely gorgeous buildings done with custom brickwork not seen anywhere else. It’s a very labor intensive job from what I was told so I think that plus material cost makes the bricks so valuable?"

If you try to throw a solid punch and do it wrong, you fuck up your fingers and/or wrist and it hurts right away. If you don’t know what you’re doing, you make a fist and just kind of...slap around wildly. You still make contact and do damage (like in the video) but you don’t hurt yourself so you can keep going.

There’s degrees of it, like my friend told me about some sects who don’t let married women wear bright colors because it’s “seeking sexual attention,” and then you’ve got Jews like my friend and her family who were a little more Pirates of the Caribbean about things. You couldn’t tell she was Jewish just by looking."

One of them, an ER nurse, came to visit me while I was recovering and when she found out what happened my husband had to stop her from going and yelling at the doctor who sent me home the first night. 

I did get a lawyer and as soon as he became involved (requesting records and such) the hospital dropped the bill they were trying to stick me with but became insanely difficult to communicate with. Eventually he said he wouldn’t take the case and he referred me to a couple other lawyers if I wanted to pursue but the required retainers were too high. I went with “Eh, they dropped the $15K they tried to bill me, good enough I guess.”"

It’s very admirable and sweet of him. Personally, I just get overwhelmed and start crying because I can’t take them *all* home and I can’t stand the thought of choosing. Luckily, last time we went to adopt, when I was starting to tear up because *there’s so many and I love them all*, this cat jumped in my lap and hunkered down and started purring like mad.
