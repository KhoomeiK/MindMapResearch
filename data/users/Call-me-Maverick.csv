InvestmentClub,fep1tdl,t1_feotdy8,1579310237.0,"The withdrawal isn’t actually happening right now. To say that the current economy reflects the reality post-Brexit just because we know it will happen doesn’t make sense

EDIT: right now there is uncertainty about what’s going to happen when the UK withdraws. What’s yet to happen is the actual consequences of withdrawal"
InvestmentClub,feo8cmg,t1_feo7l9t,1579296486.0,"My bet is that it’s gonna be a long messy slog that keeps uncertainty high and activity low. Some ups and downs as trade deals are announced and/or fall thru, with a general trend toward decline until eventually things stabilize"

harrypotter,fdt3vcg,t1_fdt1z0r,1578711574.0,"Exactly. Then there’s just one tryout for the whole year. I feel like it’s just JKR not understanding sports, or being too lazy to write the extra characters."

harrypotter,fdcrxm9,t3_ekjie5,1578282584.0,"Harry’s propensity to ask questions he should know the answer to, and his lack of understanding of simple things in the magical world even after years of being a wizard is a device that JKR uses to explain things to the reader.
