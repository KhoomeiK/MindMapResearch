socialanxiety,ff9gtqm,t3_esasd5,1579712714.0,"God, this is the worst!! The fact that my wallet is weird and I can barely fit the money in it definitely doesn't help either. Sometimes I'll just take the money and put it in my pocket until I'm out of the store."
Subnautica_Below_Zero,ff3xc27,t3_er0mtg,1579550900.0,I have the issue but with my batteries. They always disappear when I am reloading the game.
AskReddit,ff3wsjv,t1_ff2w7i5,1579550557.0,"I'm in the same boat, I stopped talking about my feelings a long time ago because I got stuck in the same loop. I realized that it's hard for the people around me to understand if they've never been through something similar. And there is no point in me trying to explain it. So now, whenever I'm having a rough time and someone is asking what's going on, I'll usually tell them that I'm not feeling okay at the moment, there's nothing that they cand do to help and that I appreciate their concern. The only that that I'd be asking from time to time is just for them to take me on a walk or something if that's helping in getting my mind off of things."
socialanxiety,fequnl3,t1_feozl02,1579346202.0,And the most annoying thing of all is that sometimes they just believe that you're a bad student that doesn't care about school because of it. Happened to me so often that half of my teachers hated me and gave me bad grades just because I tried to avoid speaking in front of the class as often as possible.
socialanxiety,feqt1h7,t1_fepioam,1579345664.0,Same thing happened to me but in high school. I didn't cry but I ran out of the room shaking like crazy and almost fainting.
MoiraMains,fek3kpt,t1_feji2ht,1579191872.0,"Yeah, Blizz can actually keep it, I don't even want it."
CPTSD,fe3o5yh,t1_fe2f4yw,1578851236.0,"I'm so sorry about your situation! This was/is one of my greatest fears as well, of ending up homeless because I can't go back home.. And I understand you perfectly, I've asked myself the same question over and over again.. Why was I not born in a caring and loving family? And I often think about how life would've looked like for me if I had that.. Because right now I am a complete mess that's hardly keeping it together."
eyetriage,fe2gp4g,t1_fe2d4lf,1578838146.0,I second this! Using a nighttime gel helped me like a ton!
socialanxiety,fds7rgu,t1_fdruwlt,1578696274.0,"I know, it's so fucked up.. And being a shy kid, doesn't help at all. This stuff stays with you. For me at least, anxiety is just one of many other ""side effects"" from years of emotional abuse."
socialanxiety,fdrrk07,t1_fdrejow,1578688665.0,"Yeah, mine started the same way.. I still vividly remember my 5 y/o self crying and shaking uncontrollably with a blanket over my head, wishing with all of my being for ""it"" to stop. But it never did..."
Subnautica_Below_Zero,fdr9dit,t3_elropo,1578681275.0,"I have the same issue with these areas, especially the Arctic Spires. It's just a huge empty map, there's absolutely nothing there besides the alien facilities. There is no need for it to be this big.

And while I love the idea of land exploring in Subnautica, Glacial Basin is just a huge unnecesary maze with a few caves thrown here and there. I don't know if other people actually enjoy it, but I find it quite annoying when I am trying to find a certain place and there's literally no landmark to point me in the right direction. I only know where the frozen leviathan cave is because of the Alterra bridge thing. And now there's two of them, for some reason. But I have no idea where the rest of the caves are without wondering around the Glacial Basin for ages. 

And the weather is like the most annoying thing in the game for me. I mean, okay, I get it, it's cold! But let me fucking see where I'm going every once in a while!! After the last update, it's even hard to navigate the rocket island... There should be days when it snows and it's foggy outside and there should be days with nice/sunny weather as well, giving you the opportunity to explore the land areas."
CPTSD,fdgfii9,t1_fdg07nq,1578394425.0,"Me too, sometimes I feel like I'm just as sick as an 80 y/o. It's been years since I last woke up without being in pain.. This is like the only thing that I miss from my childhood, being healthy.."
wehappyfew,fcu17s9,t1_fctwrti,1577969085.0,You need to find or craft a boiler suit.
Dryeyes,fcq0eic,t1_fcpyhiu,1577876048.0,"I would recommend either Refresh PM, Bausch & Lomb Soothe nighttime or Vita-pos. They are all preservative-free. Give them a try and see which one works the best for you!"
Dryeyes,fco2ep7,t1_fco06ts,1577822810.0,"I wanted to try the Bio true ones a while back, but the pharmacist started making an entire scene about how those drops were for people that wear contact lenses ONLY and what do I need them for?! And I gave up and bought another brand. Are they that good? Now I'm using Artelac Splash and they are quite good for my eyes."
Dryeyes,fcnben1,t1_fcna09q,1577808009.0,"I have the exact same problem. You need to use preservative-free only eye drops. Because the preservatives are hurting/irritating your dry eyes even more. Also, some of the preservative-free eye drops, can still ""burn"" your eyes. For me, those were the Hylo-gel ones, don't know why. So you need to try different brands until you find one that you are comfortable with. 

And you wake up with such discomfort because your eyes are getting even more dry at night. Heat masks were no help for me either. You need to try using eye gel during nighttime. They also need to be preservative-free. A humidifier in the room is also helping. Also, eye massages in the morning have really helped me. Before getting out of bed, I'm gently massaging my eyelids and the area around my eyes. 

These are all the tips I can give you at the moment and all the things that helped me so far. I wish you good luck and also, happy holidays!"
Subnautica_Below_Zero,fcl2y2b,t1_fckc0pu,1577738660.0,"Ah, I'm on the live version. But are they in some cave or just laying around the ocean floor in lily pads biome?"
Subnautica_Below_Zero,fcjydrb,t3_ehkqos,1577710418.0,"Mushroom? Do you mean the flower spore thing?

Edit: I just googled it and it seems to be a different ingredient. Honestly, I've never came across a mushroom anywhere in the cave. Maybe it's not in the game yet."
Subnautica_Below_Zero,fc5dj27,t1_fc534kr,1577454298.0,"That's so true, everytime I have to explore that place, I need to use the ""no damage"" cheat because the Ice worm is incredibly annoying. And even with that activated, he's still annoying. I tried using the ""invisible"" cheat but it doesn't work on the ice worm for some reason. 

They should definitely change his AI. Like, have some holes in the ground that you have to carefully avoid in order to not disturb him and have him chase you, or something like that."
wehappyfew,fc5690t,t1_fc33nlr,1577445347.0,"Glad to see you solved the problem, sorry for getting back to you so late. Any older save before you got stuck would do, if it ever happens again. Or teleporting yourself to a shelter, but that doesn't always work."
wehappyfew,fc2pt8n,t3_efryn7,1577370403.0,Do you have an older save?
eyetriage,fc26fll,t1_fc02v3w,1577342527.0,"Those are usually caused by astigmatism, you really need to go to an optometrist or ophtalmologist."
eyetriage,fbxzn53,t3_ef0ws6,1577204549.0,"What are you wearing glasses for? I've experienced similar symptoms as you at some point and when I went in for a check-up,it urned out that I also have astigmatism besides my original prescription for myopia. You can also try otc eye drops a few times a day and see if they help."
