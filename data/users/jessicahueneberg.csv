talesfromcallcenters,ffacwf1,t1_ffa9w5w,1579732578.0,"Yeah, I find it crazy that people have to deal with crazies threatening to sue all the time.  The two companies (one was a large telecom which people threatened to sue for all sorts of silly reasons) had a zero policy about lawsuit threats, you let them know that  you are required to hang up since litigation was mentioned and then hang up.  We would not stay on the phone and let the customer backtrack.

To be honest this made so much sense because the company would hate for a rep to try and smooth things out, only to make things worse.  Also, we would flag the account so that it would only go to leads who would pretty much tell them they cannot help with anything related to the lawsuit (including credits, misc policy questions, etc).

Since I no longer am employed with either company I have no idea if those policies are still in place.  I would only image the non-call center place I used to work at still has the same policy since it was a medical device company..."
talesfromcallcenters,ffa4uji,t3_escxfn,1579727912.0,That is crazy... I worked in one call center and one organization taking calls for customer service (I can't really call it a call center because I worked on a large campus for the organization).

I was not required to find the phone number or extension for our legal department or anything.

I honestly think blaming one or two issues does not look at the larger issues of restaurant changes the have happened in the last few years. Rent prices/minimum wage increases seem like they could be offset by increasing food prices and/or cutting costs.   I think a big issue is the affects restaurants are food delivery apps and the increase of an amazing array of restaurants throughout the San Diego.

So one night in either 1997 or 1998 we received a late night visit from a few FBI agents. They had received a “tip” that a missing Florida baby who was abducted was in my parent’s custody, the missing Sabrina Aisenberg. 

My sister had just had her baby less than a year prior and my parents had custody. I am not certain how they came to the conclusion that my niece was the victim and who reported it. One aspect that did not help my parents was that I had recently been to the Magic Kingdom a few months earlier. 

After a few rounds of interviews and documentation the FBI concluded that my niece was not the victim although they looked extremely similar and were relatively the same age. I do not believe they ever found the missing child.

This rewards customer's bad behavior because unless I start screaming that I need my drink, it doesn't get made.

I am 7+ months preggers myself and in an emergency like the one you were in I would not be concerned about having a female OBGYN. The priority is 100% on the baby. 

Second, I think once the baby is here (or even before) you two should do some couples therapy. It is really unhealthy that your partner would correlate a doctor checking on amniotic fluid to sleeping with someone before you were exclusive. Having a third party explore healthy communication techniques could be really helpful and can make you two better partners and parents.

I was trying to do blood work to confirm my doctor's hypothesis when my period went from 4 weeks long to nothing for two months.

I had nausea already from a previous medical condition so I thought nothing of the nausea... 

Also, I had taken so many pregnancy tests that had came up negative in the months leading up to my pregnancy I kind of felt like I was wasting money at this time.  I really, really wanted a baby and every negative was like a kick in the gut.  Finally my coworker convinced me to take a test just for peace of mind and it was positive.  Took another a week later and it was positive.  

I think writing off denial it kind of a weird catch all because these women all have various factors in their lives of why they doubt they are pregnant... Some have been on birth control, some still had their periods, and others feel no symptoms/had negative pregnancy tests."
