AskReddit,ffalyum,t1_ff9nucj,1579739061.0,"That's exactly what it is. No matter how many times I point out the numbers, my parents just dismiss it and say millennials are all bad with money. (This from the same two people who were once in debt, barely able to cover their basic necessities, had shaky employment prospects, and still chose to have three children... and then complained about not being able to afford nice things)"
unpopularopinion,ff4qqwi,t1_ff47mh1,1579570177.0,I hate that. I cannot stress enough how much I don't want LIVE LAUGH LOVE or #BABE or MESSY HAIR DON'T CARE in sequins on the front of an otherwise cute crewneck sweater.

preppers,fdc29a4,t3_ejx7g2,1578265671.0,Have a Silcock key handy and learn how to use it. It'll give you access to water spigots from residential or commercial buildings in your area. Just be sure to have a way to purify/filter the water you get from there.

preppers,fc7n7k5,t3_egl4yv,1577513062.0,"Canned food is good to have in your car as long as you rotate it out every few years. I always keep a serving of wet dog food (like the Cesar's brand) in my EDC, because it doesn't weigh a ton and is very nutritionally dense. For your BOB/BOV, consider freeze-dried dog food which is rather expensive but is relatively lightweight and has a 30 year shelf life. Now, you'll need to rehydrate this for it to be edible, so keep that in mind and store extra water.

For your home: White rice seals and stores really well in mylar bags, so that would be a good thing to have set aside for your dog. If you're able, grow vegetables like carrots, potatoes, or yams to add extra nutrition; several types of veggies are also available in freeze-dried form. These foods of course have the added benefit of being suitable for human consumption.

AskWomen,fc6uqab,t1_fc6s6l2,1577489996.0,"> My pipe dream would be to see the Old Kingdom Trilogy made into some kind of film.

I would be absolutely over the moon if this happened. With the recent increased public interest in epic/dark fantasy (Game of Thrones, The Witcher), maybe it's not entirely hopeless? I honestly think it's got all the parts that would make for an *incredible* big-screen adaptation.

If there are any Hollywood execs reading this thread, please take note :)"

Not when you have instant access to millions of recipes online, and to YouTube videos showing you how to do anything from basic chopping techniques to making a three course meal. Cooking is no different from any other basic life skill but people treat it like some sort of innate ability we have and they don't."
