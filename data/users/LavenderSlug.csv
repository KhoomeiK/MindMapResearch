I tried to get rehired there once and my boss said she wouldn’t hire me back because I talked people out of buying the parrots. The truth was I cared about them so much I would be honest with people about how much care they require, and how long they live. It’s a lifetime commitment. If they were looking for a pet for their kid, I would always steer them towards a hamster or something that doesn’t live 80 years."

As a painter myself I can assure you this could’ve easily taken 15+ hours of work. Not to mention the supplies which can be very costly. OP made the painting look effortless, but as they stated in the title, it took a lot of hard work. I don’t think the price is unreasonable at all. Professional artists usually make prints if you wanted something cheaper."

SuicideWatch,fgg3vhn,t3_ey5s49,1580753682.0,I once had a guy on the suicide hotline tell me the reason I was hallucinating demons was because I hadn’t accepted Jesus as my lord and savior. I hung up on him and he called back a few minutes later with a half assed apology.
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fgg05ws,t1_fgeylre,1580751392.0,"I quit drinking and using drugs for 3 months since I was so scared I’d permanently damaged my brain. I wasn’t able to go to a therapist because I was terrified to leave the house. I did go to a psychiatrist and my PCP though. Stay away from any and all stimulants (including cigarettes and coffee). It will make things much worse. I went for a run every day but I’m not sure if it really helped.  Your brain is simply stuck in fight or flight mode and is making you dissociate as a way to cope. Time is honestly the greatest healer. I was prescribed a beta blocker to help lower my heart rate, and was also prescribed Effexor and seroquel. Hang in there, it’ll get better and when you get out of this you’ll have a new sense of gratitude for your life and sobriety."
mentalhealth,fgertyy,t3_ey0z3m,1580707795.0,"Hey, the same exact thing happened to me a couple years ago. It eventually passed, but it took 3 months and various psychiatric medications. You’ll get through this. You didn’t mess up your brain. The weed just triggered a panic attack and your body is stuck in fight or flight mode. It feels like brain damage, I know, but it’s not. It’s just your body responding to extreme anxiety. Reach out for help, eat healthy and exercise, and just know that it’ll pass. I felt really guilty too that I had brought it on myself by using drugs. Don’t let the guilt consume you. You’re gonna be okay!"
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fgerb5y,t3_exxrh1,1580707307.0,This happened to me after using ecstasy. I developed derealization/depersonalization disorder. It was pretty scary stuff but it eventually passed after 3 months.

Blood immediately started spraying everywhere and I calmly walked into the room and woke him up. He took one look at the wound and started freaking out, saying we should call an ambulance, and I was like “No it’s fine I’ll just drive to the ER” and he was like “wtf no like you’re actually bleeding out”. We decided on an Uber and once at the ER he took off to go home. Ended up needing 20 staples. The doctor said I was lucky I didn’t hit my femural artery. We didn’t talk after that. That’s the only time it really hit me like “bitch you are crazy”."

mentalillness,fg0uwri,t3_ewb2pu,1580415505.0,"I’m sure the people posting were just concerned about you. I’m sorry your hospital stay wasn’t helpful. I’ve been institutionalized 4 times and I’ve had good and bad experiences. Some places just don’t have enough funding or staff to be able to help their patients. At bare minimum they kept you safe from hurting yourself for a few days.

It seems like you’re very closed off to any suggestions, which I understand probably comes from having tried so many things in the past that didn’t work (I’ve been there). But you don’t have a fighting chance unless you open yourself up to the possibility that you can get better. It took me years to find a therapist that I felt truly helped me. Good luck"
