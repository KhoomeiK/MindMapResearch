L'humour est extr√™mement subtile, et sans une bonne compr√©hension de la physique th√©orique la plupart des blagues passeront au-dessus de la t√™te du t√©l√©spectateur typique. Il y a aussi l'approche nihiliste de Rick, qui est habilement tiss√© dans sa caract√©risation- sa philosophie personnelle s'inspire grandement de la litt√©rature de Narodna√Øa Volia, par exemple. Les fans comprennent ces trucs; ils ont la capacit√© intellectuelle pour vraiment comprendre la profondeur de ces blagues, pour r√©aliser qu'elles ne sont pas juste dr√¥les- elles signifient quelque chose de profond √† propos de la VIE. En cons√©quence les gens qui n'aiment pas Rick & Morty sont VRAIMENT idiots- bien s√ªr ils n'appr√©cieraient pas, par exemple, l'humour dans la phrase d'accroche existentielle de Rick ""Wubba Lubba Dubb Dubb"", qui en soi est une r√©f√©rence cryptique √† l'√©pique russe ""P√®res et Fils"" de Tourgueniev. Je souris en ce moment m√™me rien qu'en imaginant l'un de ces niais √©cervel√©s se gratter la t√™te dans la confusion pendant que le g√©nie de Dan Harmon se d√©roule sur leur √©cran de t√©l√©vision.

Don't consider it an insult. Cultural relativism is a thing after all.
