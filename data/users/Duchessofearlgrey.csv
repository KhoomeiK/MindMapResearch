TwoXChromosomes,fenzv5n,t3_eq4sso,1579293169.0,"I don’t think him breaking up with you is because he thinks you’re useless. You both have different wants in life. It was mature of him to move on. Some people convince themselves that others will change for them, and that is a selfish attitude to have. It usually leads to a lot of pain. That being said, I don’t think it’s fair to say that women who choose to have children don’t “do something with [their] life”. There are plenty of successful women who are also mothers. This is coming from someone who doesn’t have children btw.

I’m sorry if you’re hurt because of the break-up, but it’s really seems like things worked out of the best. If you had stayed together, eventually someone would have had to compromise a huge ideal and the other would undoubtedly be resentful of that. Find someone who makes you happy and wants the same things in life."

NoStupidQuestions,feimoc6,t3_epbvbs,1579142112.0,"Honestly, 86 is a pretty advanced age for surgery regardless. It’s not unthinkable for someone that age to get a transplant, but your cousin is young and I think it’s totally acceptable for him to want to keep his kidney. One thing to remember is that people who have transplanted organs are placed on immunosuppressant drugs for life, and that elderly people are already considered immunosuppressed. Grandpa will likely be at much greater odds of getting sick and passing away if he’s on immunosuppressants. In addition to this, he has a comorbidity - diabetes. Of note, a number of transplants reject and fail.

Honestly, and this is just my opinion... I think that if grandpa is pressuring your cousin at all then that is extremely selfish of him to do so.

Your cousin saying grandpa can “get over it” is childish sounding and probably should have been handled more gently, but I have no way to know that those were your cousin’s actual words."

AskReddit,fehge9n,t1_fehe3v6,1579115996.0,"Stress is absolutely a valid reason. You’re overgeneralizing American’s eating habits and the effects of the stress response. Food and less exercise are not the only contributing factors to plaque accumulation in blood vessels, the stress response has a lot to do with this. Being able to prevent stress and cope with stress in a healthy way plays a huge role in heart health. Look up the Roseto effect - very interesting study. I’m not arguing that bad eating habits and lack of exercise don’t lend to the problem, but they do not diminish the validity of stress as a causative factor.

That being said, I agree that exercising is a good habit to have. It also is a great way to cope with stress. Also I am of the same opinion that many people think medicine can magically cure them, which lends to the problem of lawsuits and CYA medicine, but that’s a different topic altogether."

puppy101,fdkgx3s,t1_fdkfa2c,1578503634.0,"I feel your pain. My crate pooping pup did the same thing. Plus she would wake up at 4 am on the dot every day and whine. I honestly never found a solution that worked. She did this until she was old enough to be trusted sleeping in our bedroom on her own bed. Sleeping in the bedroom she’s an angel, go figure. My other dog (1 year old now) slept like rock as a puppy and still does and literally only whines when crated when he needs to potty. I’m convinced it’s their individual personalities and not training methods because I didn’t change anything between the two.

You could try throwing a frozen Kong in the cage after potty in the wee hours of the morning to keep the pup satisfied... not sure if there will be whining or sleeping once the treat is gone though."

puppy101,fdk7ptk,t3_elpm8p,1578497984.0,"1. Check that your crate is the appropriate size for your pup.
2. Set an alarm in the middle of the night and take your puppy out to potty. The puppy needs to go, but is not telling you. I had a dog that when she was a puppy she would poop in the crate without whining, smear and fling it everywhere because she was upset, and then proceed to wail like a human baby. The alarm is what resolved this problem until we knew she could hold it longer."

I don’t know how I’ll react when he’s gone.

Honestly though, the great thing about adulthood is that you can do whatever you want - so long as it doesn’t harm yourself or others. The older you get, the less concerned you will be with what others think. Your roommate might make fun of you, but who cares what they think? If you’re very concerned about it, just be open and honest with them up front. If anyone feels the need to make fun of you after hearing your reasoning, then they are just mean and would find other things to make fun of anyway.

TL;DR: No, you aren’t too old unless you choose to be and who cares what anyone else thinks."
