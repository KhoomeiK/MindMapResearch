Also general market conditions should decline soon and help you buy a little cheaper."

news,fdnx8o9,t3_em8l2c,1578594694.0,"Why force Facebook to fact check? 

Why can‚Äôt the authors of political ads be held responsible for lies? 

I have friends who use social media comments (without fact checking) as support for their position on specific issues. 

The bigger problem is the low critical thinking levels of many of us Americans. 

Someone could make a lot of money if they could create a purely curated and fact checked social media for news and information. Think of a social version of Wikipedia."

memes,fd0nzyr,t3_ejr1o8,1578121441.0,"According to the website only 6 out of 36 teams completed the challenge in 2019.

Not a high enough completion percentage to call easy, but not low enough to call hard. 

Also appears they had a grand prize. They likely took a loss on the direct cash flows of the contest if the payout was $500 for regular winners.

Seems like they took a loss on the direct cash flows from the challenge. Hopefully the marketing value paid off."
breakingbad,fcv1r6f,t1_fcv1i6m,1577992845.0,Exactly they cared about Jesse. They didn‚Äôt sell the Aunts house to make a quick buck. They didn‚Äôt think the Aunt would approve of what Jesse ended up doing in that house.
breakingbad,fcuv7lk,t1_fcutno7,1577989212.0,"They legally owned it unfortunately. Also, he was well over 18. You can only try to parent for so long after that age especially when it seems like he wasn‚Äôt listening. That‚Äôs why kicking him out for the joint made sense, they‚Äôve been through it 1000 times before. It‚Äôs Boy who cried wolf scenario. 

Homelessness could‚Äôve been a wake up call to get a legit job and clean up his act."

He popped back up in his parents lives, gave them hope he had changed, and then made them eat a loss on their home sale."

PublicFreakout,fcifhyu,t1_fcib0vm,1577661751.0,"Like I said it‚Äôs more so about 21 being close enough to the point where brain development isn‚Äôt hindered by alcohol as much. Doesn‚Äôt really have much to do about about capacity to choose. People have the capacity to choose a lot of things for themselves, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the best option (ie school vaccination requirements)

War is tricky. I can go deeper into my personal thoughts there but if your hang up is the capacity to choose then I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the government‚Äôs reasoning anyway. It may be a scape goat for politicians when challenged in public, but I think it‚Äôs more about making sure people are healthy. Another example are the sugar taxes that have cut into the super sized fast food meals of the past. People of all ages have the capacity to choose what they eat, but there‚Äôs still a right decision when it‚Äôs weighted by health."
PublicFreakout,fci5zgt,t1_fcg19b9,1577658163.0,"Able bodies are necessary for war. The case with alcohol and other drugs is that they are addictive and slow brain development until you reach an older age. 

It may seem morally wrong in terms of freedom, but they both seem valid in an attempt to keep the public safe from foreign nations as well as themselves.

It‚Äôs not fully about mental capacity to choose, but real physical effects these substances can have on a developing brain."
