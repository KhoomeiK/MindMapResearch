actuallesbians,ff5kupc,t3_erpt3p,1579597745.0,"try not be so hard on yourself about it! it was only your first time together. so long as you maintain communication (which it sounds like you two are off to a good start with), surely you'll be able to get her there given some time. put your trust in her -- it sounds like she's very understanding and will have a nice time regardless."
ac_newhorizons,ff5fijc,t3_erqunj,1579590628.0,"after happy home designer and pocket camp allowing you to edit your appearance whenever, i get the feeling that new horizons will be similar. we'll probably get to choose our initial appearance before we head to the island.   
i've been thinking a lot about the type of facilities that could go in the sort of town square we've seen in preview footage. perhaps harriet can have a shop there where we go for a makeover! i'm excited to see how this feature will be incorporated, and i hope we'll see harriet there :D"
ac_newhorizons,ff5f5ui,t3_erpaxl,1579590207.0,i totally agree! villagers' houses crushing my bushes and such really discouraged me from beautifying my town the way i wanted to.

LoveNikki,ff1odla,t1_feyapb3,1579482590.0,ughh yeah... i think if the music box could be moved in SC i might use it more. it’s irritating since with most shoes and poses the feet will line up awkwardly on it.
actuallesbians,fex6c05,t3_eqty8u,1579425242.0,my heart!!! this is precious
LoveNikki,fewmnrf,t3_eqpx8i,1579414862.0,i wish i hadn't bought red shoes. i was new and that pretty music box tempted me... the only piece i ever use is the rose petals. that 4.99 could've gone toward something much better ;-;

i didn't complete the suit but i literally never use the pieces i did get :\\ i wanted that gorgeous makeup it comes with, but in hindsight i don't think i'd even use it that much."
AskReddit,few0f31,t1_fevvldd,1579403693.0,I couldn’t agree more!
LoveNikki,fevm86y,t3_eqhyxk,1579399011.0,"Illusive Snow is without a doubt my favorite. It was like love at first sight! I use her pieces a lot, especially that gorgeous hair. I hope you can get her next time she returns! Honorable mentions go to Flickering Pistill (don’t have her yet unfortunately), Miss Bone, and Night Rose Bride.
My least favorite probably has to be Mechanical Heart. Since I don’t typically get Ruin suits, her pieces fill such a niche to where she’s useful. But I just can’t get past that hair and makeup... *shivers*"

bipolar,fe6ryum,t1_fe6psjs,1578902591.0,"i went through your whole thread with her prior to posting, this one line in particular of op's is what compelled me to post: ""Passing on shit genes is selfish."" i'm sorry if my initial meaning was unclear but i meant to be against that, as i don't feel it is selfish to have children while bipolar, or while having any ""shit"" genes at that. that kind of argument is reminiscent of eugenics imo. i'm also sorry if my initial comment seemed to dismiss those awful things she said, i'm honestly still kinda appalled by it all.  
i really hope you have a better rest of your day / night"
bipolar,fe6rk14,t1_fe6qdsw,1578902034.0,"as i read through your argument before posting i honestly felt very combative as someone with very different plans but also i understand it's not an attack.  
honestly it makes sense why your argument appeared to be the former, for example saying it's selfish to pass on shit genes, that's not cool. i hope some empathy can be extended both ways as neither family decision is more selfish than the other, in the end everyone is weighing the pros and cons and wants the best for their future / future children."
bipolar,fe6ptq6,t1_fe6oqvb,1578899796.0,"this topic is very emotional for a lot of people i think (myself included even), since planning a family is deeply personal and difficult enough without considering mental illness

bipolar,fdhiw4p,t3_elflmb,1578423594.0,"It’d be nice to know what prompted you to ask in order to give the best possible answer.
Perhaps you’re asking this out of concern for a loved one. People with bipolar disorder may have increased impulsivity, poor judgment, and racing thoughts. If it’s an extreme case, those symptoms could be bad enough to reflect what you described in your question. This would likely be happening in a very high manic state."

actuallesbians,fccqtxd,t3_eh0bac,1577601550.0,"for the past few yrs i've remained anti-porn as the industry is unethical. i have very strong feelings about the way it normalizes abuse, fetishizes minorities, and presents unrealistic depictions of sex that become the expectations for the teens who end up watching (not to mention how destructive of an addiction it can be).  
lesbian porn feels misrepresentative because it isn't representation at all. it's fetishization that twists the lesbian label into a mere act for men's viewing. it makes my blood absolutely boil tbh."

bipolar,fc7nfk4,t3_eglvgj,1577513298.0,you did a gorgeous job and it's such a cute pattern! i cross-stich as well and i find it to be a great hobby for staving off some of my worst bipolar symptoms. it's kept me busy while manic and helped me feel like i've accomplished something while depressed.
bipolar,fc4p3k6,t3_efszac,1577423428.0,"i haven’t explained it to many people (just my parents, my grandma, and my gf) but what i’ve done is first explain the basics of the disorder. i made sure to correct the common misconception that it simply makes me “moody” and instead briefly educate on mania and depression. then i go deeper into how the disorder affects me personally (ie my meds and what they do, how to tell if i’m severely manic / depressed, my common symptoms and how they can help, etc). i make sure they understand that this disorder affects many areas of my life.
it’s never easy to talk about because it’s very difficult to get people to comprehend what it’s like, but they don’t have to understand it to support you. if they care they will listen."
