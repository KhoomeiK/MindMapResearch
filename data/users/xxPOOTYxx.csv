I've had another that always like to have us on certain calls with the sales team, these calls had no value to me, but i always made it a point to always be on that call, and make at least one comment so he knew I was on the call. 

These types of things are what gets you the good review, the pay raise, the promotion, and the reputation of being a good employee/engineer and imo are just as important as being a good engineer. Pleasing the bosses is just as important and have gotten me a long way.
