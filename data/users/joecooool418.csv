Military,fgggpxx,t1_fggdvnf,1580761518.0,"You must be using GSA incorrectly then. Advantage is a great tool and is easily searched. You see pricing all over the place because GSA has contracts with manufacturers and then many vendors that meet certain socioeconomic standards. 

Say you want to buy a pneumatic tool. You look that up and see multiple vendors. https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advantage/catalog/product_detail.do?gsin=11000005104096 The cheapest one may be the manufacturer but they are a large business. GSA then allows vendors that are small businesses, woman owned businesses, minority owned businesses, HUB zone businesses, veteran owned businesses, or service disabled veteran owned businesses to also list the product. They now all have to use the same part number so those prices show up all under the same listing. You as the customer are supposed to do business with all of these groups and GSA by identifying these vendors, allows you the buyer to choose the item that meets your socioeconomic goals. 

Walmart and Amazon are not set up to identify the business class of their vendors. Actually only Amazon has vendors, Walmart is just Walmart. Amazon also allows Chinese goods which are not TAA compliant which is mandatory for DoD buyers. And as a study was done by the US Naval Academy shows, about 80% of the time items ordered through Amazon are both more expensive and take longer to get than the same items ordered through GSA. https://federalnewsnetwork.com/commentary/2018/01/urban-myths-are-gsas-prices-fair-and-reasonable/

GSA contracts are negotiated off of most favored customer pricing (MFC). If you want to sell on GSA you have to sell at or below your MFC pricing. No such guarantee exists with Amazon. 

Then there is the price reduction clause that is in GSA schedule contracts. If your MFC pricing is reduced, then the government then gets that new lower pricing automatically. 

There are laws and regulations that prevent abuse in the GSA system. Violators can lose their contract, be debarred from federal business, pay hefty fines and actually go to jail. Grainger for example, recently paid a $70 million fine for not giving GSA customers the best prices. No such guarantees or  protections exist with Amazon. 

And finally there is no competition with Amazon. That is a requirement with the federal acquisition regulations. Because of the way GSA contracts are negotiated, buying from GSA satisfies the requirements of a competitive bid. 

GSA is working to consolidate all the schedules this year into one schedule and when that is done, GSA Advantage is going to look and act just like Amazon but with all the guarantees and protections that the FAR require."

If you want something, be very specific with the requirements. I'm a contractor and I see bids go out every day that were either written by a lazy contracting officer or by someone who didn't really know what they wanted. 

I sell the best, most expensive industrial equipment in the world, and the DoD buys millions of dollars worth of product from me every year. But thats because I learned early on that I had to provide an in depth specification with my quotes if I had any hope of them actually buying my stuff. 

The lesson here is if you want quality, you have to specify quality. Otherwise you end up with the cheapest shit that meets the limited scope of the solicitation.

Oh and you can always buy from GSA with your GPC. Every high quality item is there and purchasing from GSA satisfies the requirements of competitive bidding."
