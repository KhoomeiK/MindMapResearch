childfree,feb1ule,t1_fdfn3uu,1578954640.0,Hey cool. I’m relocated here from someone else too. I was mainly asking for couples because I didn’t want to make it seem like I’m just looking to bang! Message?

A beagle will eat anything and basset hounds can easily become overweight enough to do damage, you are right to be concerned. I have been unable to exercise my guy very much over the last few months because I injured my knee, and I’m side-eyeing his belly right now wondering if I’m just seeing things or he’s a bit thicker. I know I’m not overfeeding him, but I’ll feel better when I can walk him again regularly.

Also, mine is nearly 12... and very healthy. And I’ve kept him trim since he was a pup. He’s in way better shape than I am, probably since one of my steps is like 16 weenie steps, but yeah"
fatlogic,fc6v0ju,t1_fc6uwlj,1577490208.0,"He has a dog that’s even worse than mine. His beagle once ate her own shit, then woke him up at 3 am puking at the foot of his bed. He gets it."
fatlogic,fc61zk4,t1_fc5qhiy,1577470460.0,"Yep. Mine’s a mix, half dachshund, half basset hound, but it goes for any dwarf breed. Corgis as well. Dachshund spines are particularly sensitive, and all those breeds are prone to hip dysplasia as well. Keeping them trim is very important, because with extra weight, they become highly prone to injuries. And I don’t have five grand to spend on laser spinal surgery for a weenie. Much easier to just keep him in shape."
fatlogic,fc61pyj,t1_fc61hp5,1577470288.0,"Thankfully, he laughed and helped me clean it up. But we’re still absolutely confused as to where he found the tampon. Nobody in the house at the time had been using them..."
fatlogic,fc4z4j7,t3_eg5oao,1577434837.0,"My dog once intuitively ate an entire used tampon and then vomited it up on my bed while I was trying to get laid. I’m pretty sure I need to monitor his fucking diet.

And all jokes aside, becoming overweight is literally lethal to his breed. It’s the one of the most likely complaints linked to early death in tube dogs."
