Gong hei fat choy!"
insanepeoplefacebook,ffnrghu,t1_ffnn1tz,1580069771.0,Nice opinion articles.  Nothing I haven’t heard before.  Good luck on getting the oil to the coast for your future Chinese overlords.  I hope it happens for you.
insanepeoplefacebook,ffnm2bu,t1_ffnkb41,1580067690.0,"Why should we have a pipeline thru the US for you to sell your oil elsewhere.  Fuck that!  Send it to the coast in BC or East to whatever province.  I’m a bit familiar with the issue and I support the indigenous people for not allowing oil companies to pipe thru their ancestral lands.  If you think selling oil to China is a better option than to the US you’re nuts.

I’ll gladly support the “environmental activists” 

Also, we get less than 8% of our oil from the Middle East, hardly proving your point.  Oil is a commodity that must be paid for at market prices. Nobody is getting oil for free regardless of what orange man says."

Last I checked, the US has been picking up the check for everybody.  Like I stated earlier, I wish the US would have went isolationist before WW1."
insanepeoplefacebook,ffnivgw,t1_ffnhxg3,1580066492.0,Your a good man Lian Coubert.
insanepeoplefacebook,ffnif0o,t1_ffn6hsy,1580066338.0,Lol.  Good stuff.  Makes me wish sometimes that the US would’ve stuck with the isolationist path before WW1 and let the world burn.

madlads,ffjdac1,t1_ffj96su,1579995858.0,Naw.   I just found on some random post.  I don’t know where this crazy man is from.  Could be either Georgia.
madlads,ffj8d7b,t1_ffipf9c,1579992887.0,"Maybe he’s from Georgia SSR, former commie CCCP land, home of Stalin.

If so, then by your logic, all non-Americans are like this."
