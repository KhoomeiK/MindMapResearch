college,fefu2w7,t1_feez6lr,1579065228.0,"I would do something like: 
Hey Prof,

I’m applying to ~insert internship/company here~ and think you would be a great person to speak on my ~relevant skills here~.  I realize you’ve written a similar letter for me in the past, so if you would be willing to just update that letter, please let me know! I look forward to hearing from you."
college,fee3nh9,t3_eon0ru,1579025720.0,When you ask for the letter just remind her that she has written one for you before and that she could just update that one with the most recent info.
college,fdw3f11,t3_en82r8,1578754685.0,"As stupid as it sounds, self-plagiarism is a very real thing.  Ask your professor if they care before you do this, you don’t want to risk getting in trouble with your school in your last semester."
college,fdj4bci,t1_fdiiqzo,1578458078.0,"I mentioned that it’s for a letter of rec so they would be able to tell me over email if they immediately didn’t feel comfortable/didn’t have time to write it (again, very unlikely, but it just gave me confidence when going in to meet them!)"
college,fdihkx2,t3_elk78h,1578443084.0,"Just finished doing all this for grad school apps.  Going straight to their office intimidated me a ton so I emailed to set up a meeting.  Whatever you choose, remember that professors are typically very understanding and just consider it a part of their job (aka I stressed myself out for nothing haha)"
GRE,fcnarao,t3_efk3ee,1577807573.0,"I got 162Q/154V on PP1, 156Q/159V on PP2, and 160Q/157V on the real thing.  These were all taken within 4 days of each other (I had to cram all my studying into one week, would not recommend lol).  Take those PowerPreps seriously (don't take extra breaks, don't look at study material during, etc), and the real thing will be very comfortable.  I got experimental verbal and still have no idea which one it was, all of mine seemed pretty average."
AreYouTheOne,fc9xvla,t3_egumsw,1577559835.0,The app makes everyone’s conversations public so you can essentially creep on anyone you want. SUCH a weird concept.
DavidDobrik,fc8rhze,t3_egkdc3,1577540680.0,"I remember when David spoke at my university he very casually mentioned a story about a guy visiting his house. He said the dude told Taylor he was there for David’s help editing a video, and she was super new at the time so she thought the guy was someone David actually knew. David comes out to see who the guy is and turns out the video he wants advice on is a tutorial on “how to find David Dobrik’s house” and a vlog of him traveling there...literally in WHAT WORLD would that conversation go well???"
FrankOcean,f91sf4c,t3_e3996d,1574999781.0,You would probably really like the Endless album then. Try U-N-I-T-Y and Slide on Me
