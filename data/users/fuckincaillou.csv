AskReddit,ffbs3x6,t3_esjj44,1579780618.0,"I don't have much of a story compared to some, but here's my (mini) experience so far:

* The gist: I went to school 1000+ miles away hoping to get some distance from less-than-great family, my mother invited herself along ""because she was worried about me"" but really because she had some idea of a whole new life? IDK, but I guess it worked out because I got sick enough to miss school for 2-3 weeks and puke blood at one point. I get a check from sallie mae that was originally intended to pay for the student apartments I had been intending to live in instead, my mother mentions me getting a check to her Nmother (a raging narcissist whereas my mom was def. the scapegoat), and Ngrandma immediately demands to know how much the check was for. I ended up having to give that stupid check to my mom anyways to help pay for the apartment cuz my dad was having trouble paying for it on top of the mortgage, and she got a parent loan later to help me pay for school, so I guess it worked out kinda? Eh.

My BFF also had an experience too, so I guess I'll share that here to keep the popcorn going:

* She's always been ridiculously good with math, so when it came time to pick a major in college she decided on Comp Sci. (mostly because her boyfriend was going into it too--I warned her about making that big of a decision solely based on romantic partners but she insisted that it wouldn't end up badly and I was just all ""mkay ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"". I guess it worked out okay since they're getting married this year! He's a good guy and they make great catparents). Both BFF and her boything end up getting hired before graduation by tech giants and I think they're making around $200k a year combined at least. BFF's mom is really sweet and I have a lot of good memories with her, when she wasn't on the bottle, but money gets tight and BFF's mom asks her for some money to help cover mortgage payments. BFF goes, ""Sure, but I need to make it a loan because I don't feel good about lending out that much money when I need to cover my own payments. It'll be no-interest, though, and just make sure to pay it back on a semi-reasonable timeline."" Her mom got *pissed*, and I'm not currently sure how their relationship is doing.

So even just seeing that tiny bit of how much money changes the people around you is kind of terrifying. I don't feel good at knowing I'm only seeing one side of people and not the entirety of themselves when I interact with them. Like, I always knew that, but it's uncomfortable seeing people that are supposed to love you turn into sociopaths over only a couple thousand dollars. 

I'm not even sure if these will be the last stories I have on the topic. I've been talking with this one guy I met at work last year that I was interested in and I just found out that his dad has a brand new rolls royce and a private jet. The dad is currently planning another multimillion renovation on one of his properties that I will probably be expected to assist in (my dad is what I'd call a white-collar tradesman and I've helped him in the past), which will mean seeing this dude almost every day. I know he's interested in me right back. I'm considering not pursuing any relationships with him mostly because I'm terrified of it going anywhere significant and watching my family turn into sociopaths as a result of that kind of money (though there are a few other reasons, that is the most significant)."
