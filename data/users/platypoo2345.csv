Some general thoughts: RPE is hard as fuck to gauge if you've never done it before and benching after front squatting is rough on my wrists. Program seems like fun so far"

So fucking tired of getting sick from everything on campus, happened twice during this run making me take weeks off in addition to me straining a muscle in my low back that led to serious pain when squatting.

Here's hoping for health next cycle, I'm thinking of maybe doing DUP Submaximal twelve week as maybe my last cycle before I go to Asia and have very limited gym access"

3x int bench (high)

2x beg squats (for front squat)

1x int deadlift

Trying to set it up so I can do it in four days, probably will double up on squat d1/bench d3 and squat d2/deadlifts"
weightroom,fehfvhl,t1_fehde6f,1579115689.0,"No, I'm currently running it with embrace the pain for deadlifts. Took a break from squats because I strained a muscle and only back squatting was agitating it, so after I test my 1rm on this bench cycle I'll be probably running 2x beg squat for front squats. Not sure what the plan for deadlifts is yet"
weightroom,fehb6y5,t1_feh8wqz,1579112955.0,It was technically an e1rm because I genuinely had no idea what my max was. I call it a TM though because it was a number I knew I could hit and I didn't want to retest
weightroom,fegzpmn,t1_fefyqjh,1579106097.0,"Yeah honestly I set my TM at 200lbs during my first cycle and I doubt my tested 1rm is gonna be over 215, so if it isn't 3x intermediate looks like a nice increase in volume"
