BabyBumps,fcor1id,t1_fcoql70,1577839254.0,"Same here, would be nice but I just don’t think 33% is doable for us now unfortunately"
BabyBumps,fconlwa,t1_fco9ajl,1577836739.0,"If you’re Canadian and working, shouldn’t you be eligible for 55% from the government?  Not a top up but still better than nothing..."
BabyBumps,fcomuka,t1_fcncyrf,1577836197.0,"When they announced 18 months as an option I figured it was a given I’d do it, obviously!  But now I’m looking at the situation right in front of me and adding the numbers and I’m not so sure"
BabyBumps,fcoavy2,t1_fco8daq,1577827764.0,"Yep, my partners contract unfortunately doesn’t have language for 18 month leave so our plans for him being off were scuttled, but still able to rearrange and very fortunate he gets the top up he does anyway!"

PersonalFinanceCanada,fclttjv,t3_ehnc2b,1577756304.0,"Extremely flexible work schedule -could work 8 days one month, 25 the next if I need more money.  Pick and choose days off, can get a month off straight without using any vacation time.

24 days paid vacation - goes up over time.  I think I’m at 30 days starting in 2021.

Travel benefits - only pay taxes for flights taken on own time.  Travel for work and get per diems anytime you’re away.

Employee shares - company matches.  They just lowered it to match 33% of yearly contributions, but it’s still something."
bujo,fc9tjpz,t3_egtuhf,1577558012.0,Honestly I needed this
BabyBumps,fc7aeh4,t1_fc6meng,1577501785.0,"I’m picky about clothing and so is my sister.  She has two baby girls, I have a boy on the way, but because we both like gender neutral, higher-quality local companies, we are already passing clothes back and forth and hopefully will for years to come as more LOs are born!  

I don’t mind hand-me-downs at all, but a lot of people just give you their garbage that they don’t want to sort and throw themselves."
BabyBumps,fc79v29,t1_fc6xq57,1577501368.0,I already know this is going to happen to me and I’m only due in January.  Putting away clothes all last week wondering if I should set a phone reminder to check the boxes before he grows too much
BabyBumps,fc79rlv,t1_fc6m78b,1577501295.0,"NONE. OF. IT. IS NEWBORN!

My only newborn clothing is hand me downs from my sisters kids (thank god for those) literally every gift we’ve gotten is 3-6 months at least."

AskReddit,fc1vm55,t3_efaqo0,1577331110.0,"Girl, mid-20s, walks to the back mid-takeoff to go to the lav, and when she’s told to sit back down, says she’s gotta go.  Squats outside the lavatory door and pees.

Since we’re still very much climbing, her pee runs across the floor onto the other FAs feet.  When I talk to her to see if she’s drunk or sick (do we need to turn the plane around/how serious is this?) she asks “does this happen to people a lot?”

Literally no like what??  Then she didn’t want to take gravol or any meds we had to help her nausea because she wanted to drink on the flight, which I actually accidentally laughed in her face and said “you’re not drinking.”

Turn to get her water, turn back and she’s gone.  She’s gone back to her seat.  But she hadn’t pulled down her pants to go pee, so she was sitting in her pee pants for the next 6 hours..."
AmItheAsshole,fbu5q8g,t1_fbty6hf,1577108231.0,Glad to hear!  You’re a good dude.
