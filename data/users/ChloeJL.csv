Awwducational,ff1omcb,t1_ff17asw,1579482738.0,"how are they interfering? the shrews don’t interact with any humans during the video, OP is simply filming them doing their little shrew thing"
holdmyfeedingtube,feu7t8w,t1_feu2hxc,1579383944.0,"i mean, i get it the complaint, but this IS r/holdmyfeedingtube where the expected posts are seeing people either get seriously injured or die. shouldn’t really be browsing the subreddit at work anyways haha"
wholesomememes,fejtode,t1_fejtjfl,1579185595.0,"how so? i work with animals and have had many in the past. i believe they should be euthanized when the owner knows they’re not acting themself anymore to the point where they’re getting no enjoyment out of their life. they can be on medications for pain, but the priority is that they are comfortable"
wholesomememes,fejk713,t1_fejiipw,1579177620.0,"i got the impression the fish were fake and this looks like an aquarium for real fish

BodyDysmorphia,feiq23q,t1_feiq0zx,1579144375.0,i did. they said they bet you’re cuter than you think you are :)
BodyDysmorphia,feihtk7,t1_fegkd3h,1579138861.0,agreed! i have the same insecurities to the exact wording and my boyfriend told me the majority of men actually prefer a rounder face as it’s more feminine
AskReddit,fedrf7n,t3_eolcgu,1579018276.0,my boyfriend (aka “sexual partner”) has shelves full of them in his room and i think it’s cute. at least he has hobbies haha

relationship_advice,fdkws16,t1_fdkmy35,1578512764.0,"woman here, pads are 100x more gross in my opinion. the blood rubs against you all day and you feel it. it smells too because, ya know, it’s still blood. tampons, however, have no feeling whatsoever when they’re inside of you and it’s a quick clean up. this is just a (likely fake) horror story and the actual experience is nothing like it.
“why don’t women just not bleed for chrissake?!”"
hamstercare,fdiffsn,t1_fdhluo0,1578441689.0,"you sound like you care so much. you’re exactly the kind of person who should be taking on pets like these. keep doing what you’re doing! sure, bigger is always better with hamsters, but know that you’ve got your heart in the right place and she’ll benefit from it :)"
BodyDysmorphia,fdhog88,t1_fdhmris,1578426953.0,"this. ugh when someone takes a surprise picture of me and sends it to me and goes “check your phone” and watches my reaction. because of this, i had to tell my friends about my body disorder and beg them to just avoid pictures of me altogether"
BodyDysmorphia,fdeb8qw,t3_ekvi0e,1578335235.0,"my bdd worsens as my social anxiety worsens and my psychiatrist confirmed that general anxiety has a relationship with bdd. she said that if you find the right treatment for anxiety then the bdd will lighten up as well. maybe the bpd is correlated as well or anxiety springs from the symptoms of bpd that worsen bdd? i’m no doctor, but it kinda makes sense"
BodyDysmorphia,fdcsqy8,t3_eklnvd,1578283264.0,"it doesn’t have to be all positive. i see your point, but sometimes people want to use this subreddit as a place to vent to people who suffer from the same ailment. no one else understands. i’ve seen treatment discussed as well here, so it’s not like people never post with positivity. i just feel like a subreddit like this needs to help people at their worst as well"
