AskReddit,fent0h8,t3_eq1wzh,1579290327.0,"No one thing would make me 100% happy right now.  What would help though is enough money I can live comfortably without having to work, answers for my never ending pain and a partner."
personalfinance,fdsgjd8,t1_fdqnvri,1578702291.0,"Midwest for the win on that one.  I can't imagine I'd be able to survive out there with how expensive everything is (then again, I'd probably get paid more too)."
personalfinance,fdqlcw3,t1_fdqgxc5,1578669439.0,"I can't imagine my kids will ever be able to afford having their own kids. My kids are 16 and 18. When they were both in daycare it cost over $1k a month, I know it's only higher now.

My house payment is only $420 a month for comparison (bought 2.5 years ago)."
bipolar,fdpf18n,t1_fdp9jpj,1578626945.0,"I don't think anything has been released from that one yet.  23andme does have a blog they post their research papers to though.

My original pdoc did the genesight thing, I think it really helped with nailing the right meds.

She gave me a copy and said here, next time you go to a doctor about anything involving pain show them this and say see none of them work, I'm not lieing."
bipolar,fdpelg4,t1_fdowtpp,1578626633.0,"No idea in general, this one I heard about from someone else I know... as a bonus they gave access to all the genetic data."
bipolar,fdowi4p,t1_fdo5nu5,1578614471.0,"From other comments, the data for this is from before latuda was out"
bipolar,fdoweko,t1_fdo9jbd,1578614407.0,"Tell me about it... had to switch doctors and my new one refuses to prescribe it because she doesnt want to do a prior authorization... my old one is good until 2099.

It's how about geodon... umm, as already discussed I'm very allergic to it hence why I had no problem getting the prior authorization for latuda.

I wish there wasnt such a shortage of pdocs."
bipolar,fdovxyn,t1_fdoo9pz,1578614106.0,"They did do a survey where they took DNA samples from people with bipolar disorder and depression, then once a month had them play either some cognitive games or answer med and lifestyle questions about how they were feeling.  For a year.

They did this around 2017/2018 though.  This seems to be older data"
bipolar,fdoulo1,t1_fdoqgs7,1578613231.0,"Never taken seroquel but lamictal with topamax works great for me (topamax really only needed to take care of the migraines lamictal gives me).  Add in some latuda to get my brain to shut up now and then and I'm golden.

But of course I had to switch doctors and my new one has backed my lamictal and topamax off to 50mg a day and refuses to prescribe me latuda so I'm having a great time."
IDontWorkHereLady,fdnpqp1,t1_fdnnrhu,1578590552.0,"In my years of retail I had that happen once.  Amish lady at a hardware store.  She was at least nice.

I have had it happen multiple times that someone found me again before the next item they were looking for."
AskReddit,fditioz,t1_fdh4s94,1578450697.0,"Somewhat similar experience.  I get migraines, back when I was a kid it was thought they weren't a thing kids could get.  Teacher can tell I'm feeling awful sends me to the office to go home.  They take my temperature... no fever so I have to stay.  Custodian makes some snide comment about me trying to skip out of school.

I come back teacher is like uhh... well just put your head down and rest then.  20 minutes later I puke all over the damn place.  I got to go home, custodian got to clean up after me."
AskReddit,fc1lif3,t1_fc1bpkb,1577322359.0,"It is excellent, I highly recommend it."
