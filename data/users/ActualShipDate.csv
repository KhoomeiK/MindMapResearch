stopdrinking,ffgwig1,t3_etcy4o,1579916849.0,"False confidence. The week I landed in rehab, I had a few sober days under my belt. I went out, literally had the two drinks, and nothing happened. I had it under control!!!!!! The next day after those two drinks, an unexpected work event came up. I thought it was so easy last night, this time I got it. I figured it out! I had two drinks, and as I got tipsy, I forgot that I was supposed to stop drinking.  

That night was so bad, so fucking heartbreaking and humiliating that it was my breaking point and checked myself into rehab for the first time in my life. 

False confidence and the idea that you can keep it under control is a one track way into deepening alcoholism. Please be careful."
stopdrinking,ffgw0ph,t3_etbdxe,1579916491.0,"It's been over a year since I've been out of rehab, and I have slipped and fell various times since. I thought that quitting drinking was going to be some miraculous magic bullet that will solve all of my problems and make me happy.   

My current happiness is the joy of no longer doing suicidal self harm to myself while drunk. I'll take bored and depressed any day, at least I know that I'm not going to do some fucked up destructive shit and end up hating myself.  

It used to be that I would rather feel guilty and suicidal and commit self harm than to be bored. I would rather hate myself and hurt myself than face a minute of boredom. Because apparently the fucked up destructive shit and isolation and crumbling relationships and life is more fun than being bored. Having constant bruises all over my body so that I have to wear pants and long sleeves in the summer was a real scream. At least I was having fun!

Why do any of us want to stop drinking? So many reasons, but one of them is because it's just not fun anymore. Drinking is not fun for alcoholics. It hasn't been fun for a very, very, very long time. Otherwise, why would we even think about quitting? Turns out that destroying your life, destroying your family's life, and eventually dying in the worst painful way... delirium tremens, wet brain, liver failure...  none of that is very fun at all.

Think about it this way: maybe quitting will never make you feel better. but at least it won't make you feel worse."

C_S_T,ffgtsew,t3_etehj9,1579914867.0,"Few points: 

\- We tend to think of Humanity vs The Earth in a dualistic way, as if we were somehow separate entities. That is illogical. We are not separate from the Earth. We did not \*take\* Earth and suck it dry. We are not space invaders, we are the natural result of the Earth's evolution. We have a parasitic quality about us... but parasites are part of the Earth as well. You cannot separate these concepts and maintain logical consistency.

But if you want to break it down to dualism... sure.

\- Nature has died and taken down all the living things with it countless times in the history of the Earth. The dinosaurs is a sterling example. But Nature has recreated itself each and every time, and advanced further each time.... which means Nature never really died to begin with.  It also means that Humanity cannot kill nature. We can alter it, fill it with pestilence, and seriously fuck up the aesthetics, but we cannot kill it.  The force of Nature is so unfathomably great and grand, it has stood up and surpassed literally every event ever. Like meteors and comets and shifting tectonic plates and whatnot. These are so much stronger than the force of Humanity. 

\- The idea that ""we can kill nature and the earth"" is one of complete arrogance. And ignorance. No offense. To say that we can kill nature is saying that we are bigger and more grand than Nature, and it's like lol no. Man cannot, and will not ever, be able to control Nature. Nature is omniscient and omnipotent. It is everywhere at once.  We are none of these things. Nature created us, and eventually nature will destroy us. Not the other way around. 

\- Nothing made by Humanity is permanent. The fate of every empire is to eventually fall and wither and die until there's nothing left but artifacts. No matter how big, great, grand, Nature always wins. One day our civilization and our technology and pestilence will become oil a mile underfoot. 

\- Up until the 19th century industrial revolution, humanity has lived in relative peace with nature.  I think your beef is with the generations that advanced the industrial revolution, not humanity at large. Because if you want to call it ""humanity"", then  you're including native peoples who continue to live in perfect harmony with the earth.  

\- The guilt you feel about it all is demotivating, demoralizing, and a big cause of depression. If you are unmotivated and demoralized and depressed you cannot ACT. The enemy isn't this huge long list of cognitive distortions you've convinced yourself of, the enemy is the guilt you feel. The guilt is paralyzing.  A depressed and paralyzed you is an ineffective you. And if your calling is environmentalism, it is paralyzing guilt that's stopping you from doing anything about the problems that you see.  You working on your emotional complexes, guilt, and depression IS LITERALLY THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO FOR NATURE AND THE EARTH. Because when you are empowered, you are unstoppable. And you may very well be the counteractive force that the world needs in order to conserve the present state for future generations. 

\- Heal the world by healing yourself. Cognitive distortions, logical fallacies and inconsistencies, and a worldview informed by media bullshit will destroy your mind. Turn off the news, turn off the TV, go smell a flower, and get therapy for the massive guilt complex you have. You did not create the problems. It's like a toddler feeling guilt for its parents mistakes. It makes no sense. 

\- I do not care about drama entertainment or politics. Neither does my social group or my friends. I don't associate with people like that, they are dead between the eyes. We care about environmentalism, philosophy, art, human nature, and advancing ourselves to be fit and fully capable of realizing our dreams. There are millions and millions and millions and millions of people like this. They just don't get the media spotlight. You will find your people. Stop listening to media fearmongering, I really think that this is the cause of your depression, the media uses guilt tactics to control people. You are being manipulated."

getdisciplined,fet1inp,t1_fep9a62,1579370932.0,"I’m on my mobile I may have previously replied to wrong thread. Here are some thoughts about that. 

I’m really interested that you mentioned this. I was getting into some pretty heavy deep esoteric archetypes and ancient religions and cultures and practices across time - I came upon a concept. A demon is vanished by identifying it, then immediately smiting it with ones mightiest power. There can be no hesitation. One must be absolute SURE that the demon can be vanquished. That’s the only way the demon can be vanquished.

If you are ambivalent, if you don’t know how you feel, if you’re too tired or this or that - the moment you think “I may actually not have to...” THATS the moment the demon wins. The texts are very clear on something- you give that negative unseen shadow self power (the demon) the demon whenever you have to consider whether you should do it or not. If you do it immediately, the negative guilt complex literally cannot affect you emotionally. It has no power over you. You cannot logically feel guilty for something That has already been done. The drill sergeant has nothing to yell about.

But the moment you say “should I” you open a line of communication with the shadow self, the mythic demon. You cannot defeat your own shadow self, you can only learn how to make it truly happy. That means one thing - learn how to make yourself happy, learn how to use those urges for good.

That’s always done by followings ones inner calling of art and passion. In other words, you make the shadow self happy by actually doing creative things instead of agonizing about not doing them."

JordanPeterson,fepttwo,t1_fek6trl,1579331064.0,"I agree. A person should make a decision to minimize damage. It’s the most rational option in any situation, the avoidance of danger. But what are you really saying there? At what point does it make it morally and okay for a some dick to penetrate someone else’s body, because she chose to drink alcohol?  

People that are blacked out act like this - the ether in the alcohol turns off the frontal lobe of the brain, which is for “rationality and intelligence”. A person who ingests alcohol over a certain level is physically incapable of making rational choices after having a couple of drinks. 

So to keep vital systems alive, the mammal and reptile brain activate. The body stays animated, but nobody is home. The person acts like a child. The chaotic actions and drama of a 5 year old - the motherfucking mammal brain. All they want is food, sex, safety, and the drama of a chaos beast. After 2 - 3 drinks, the woman starts acting like a seductive child, trying to be smooth but hahaha accidentally sloppy. If a woman is acting fucking stupid and dramatic OR they’re just wanting to get massssssively deeeeeepppp into feelings (usually results in hella fighting). These are indicators that a person is blackout drunk. They’re soooooooooo affectionate and like you’re the most amazing person in the world and wanna fuck you right now, but you realize that their vision is off and they have a hard time stabilizing and they’re being loud... that person is either blacked out or browned out (partial memory). 

If a woman is like this, she is legally unable to consent. She is not able to function basis her frontal lobe rational brain so she’s sloppy as hell and chaotic. This woman is alive and animated, but you look in her eyes and she’s zoning out here and there and you wonder how much she’s had to drink - that is the legal point of consent. People that are blacked out are perfectly capable of using their body to walk around, eat, and have sex. They’re not *passed* out. 

In which cases is it morally okay to push a dick in that woman and rationalize it as “we were having fun and she seemed okay with it”. ? Why is it a right to unlawfully steal that woman’s property rights to her personal sovereignty. 

In the most rational sense how does her decision to drink alcohol and black out justify the ~potential~ of raping her? 

In other words, if men want to drink and have sex, why can’t they watch a fucking 10 min YouTube video about the signs a person is blacked out. If a person seems too drunk - do not have sex with her. Because according to the law, to do so is considered rape, and thus punishable by law? Why?? Because *not knowing that a person is blacked out is not a rational justification for rape*.  

I’m specifically proposing this- the BAC required for the person to black out varies person by person. A simple blood test can provide evidence that a person is not able to consent. And I say “person“ because I am not being gender specific, and I support the mental health and strong emotional support and community for male survivors as well. That being said, what I want you to understand here is how **fucking tricky** this shit is. However, it’s the reality. 

If two people are blacked out - I’ll come back to that one. Requires way more thought. If one person is blacked out and then other pushes themselves onto and rapes the other - a crime has been committed.

I support fucking. But I only support Healthy Consensual Fucking. Do yourself a favor and educate yourself on how to navigate in case you’re in doubt. The signs of blackout at rape level BAC can be distinguished if you know what to Look out for. Why not if you’re going to drink and have sex with people not educate yourself on the signs of being black out drunk and if you’re ever in fucking doubt whether a person is blacked out or not think of the horrible repercussions of what might happen if that person were blacked out and give it the benefit of the doubt.

Why risk Your life instead of taking 10 minutes to educate yourself with the truth, the signs of a person who is black out drunk? And if you doubt whether a person is blacked out... just don’t stick your dick in them. If you had a BAC measure and could take a reading the moment of fucking and prove she’s not blacked out, by all means shes telling lies and regret. If she can prove physical signs of blackout at the time of event, there may be a case for rape. Individual cases may vary.

The easiest solution: don’t have sex with people you suspect may be too drunk to consent sexually. If you suspect a brown or blackout, don’t have sex with them no matter how much they seem to want to. Are you spending your time and energy drinking alcohol and having sex with people? Educate yourself on the signs of blackout, ignorance is not an excuse for a crime."

getdisciplined,fencs8s,t3_epzxm2,1579281920.0,"I'm currently in dialectical behavioral therapy, I struggle with your exact same problem. The game-changer for me is constantly asking myself this question: ""What if my emotions were not in the way? What if my emotions were not a factor in the situation? What could I do in my life, what could I achieve, what kind of experiences do I have the potential to have - if my emotions weren't in the way?""

In corollary, Currently I'm working on stopping the judgment of my emotions. WHen I procrastinate or avoid or get into my unhealthy patterns, I beat myself up. Really hard. Like, I think of myself as a failure, I can't reach my goals, I'm incapable of XYZ ""simple"" task, why am I so deficient and incapable that I can't JUST DO THE DAMN TASK. I learned that when I procrastinate or avoid, this narrative reel starts playing in my head, so judgmental about my character and capability as a person.  These thoughts are paralyzing. Somewhere deep inside of myself, my tender feelings are getting their ass kicked by Judgmental Thought me.  It's like, imagine you're trying to do a productive task, and you have this negative drill sergeant right behind you yelling in your ear that you suck as a person and you're a failure and you're broken. Like, who the fuck could get anything done?? This inner drill sergeant is upsetting me, being verbally abusive and unfairly judgmental, and it's compromising my mood. So how do I get rid of the drill sergeant?  I check out... check out of myself, check out of my mind, check out of the task, procrastinate.  All while Drill Sergeant never really went away. It just gets louder like SEE!! YOU CHECKING OUT AND AVOID IS LITERALLY PROOF OF YOUR FAILURE. So then I get racked with guilt, I get so upset. The fucking drill sergeant seems to never go away. Some people check out by relying on alcohol, drugs, workaholic, shopping, food, etc. It's like it's the only relief. 

So I go back to my first question - what if there was no drill sergeant? What if I didn't have to do the emotional labor of taking the verbal abuse? What if I didn't have to avoid the drill sergeant (therefore avoiding the task at hand)? What if the drill Sargent turned into a cheerleader who supports me? WHAT IF MY EMOTIONS DID NOT GET IN THE WAY OF MY PROGRESS? 

So now... 

1. Look at the task at hand
2. Do not THINK about the task. Do not think about ""whether you should do it or not"".  Go immediately from sight to action - no internal questioning and battling against the drill sergeant. 
   1. By avoiding thinking about whether the task should be done or not, you avoid  the inner turmoil of ambivalence. By avoiding ambivalence, you avoid the Sergeant.  And by avoiding the Sergeant, you avoid the verbal abuse, the feelings of failure, the character attacks about what I can and cannot do, and the ensuing anxiety and depression for having to go through this fucking ENTIRE EMOTIONALLY DRAINING AND HURTFUL DRAMA - just because you have some laundry to do that you don't feel like doing. 
   2. Think about it this way: when I indulge in ""Thoughts About Whether I Should Do This Thing Or Not"", I invite the Sargeant in and it's verbal abuse. It's like this is the name of the Sargent.  Instead of it's name being Sargent Smith, his name is ""Sargent Should I Do This Task or Not"".  
   3. Recap: By entertaining the question about how you can avoid a task or whether it should even be done, you entertain the Sergeant and invite in the character judgment and abuse. ""I can't do this. I'm incapable. Why am I always failing?"" 
   4. DO NOT THINK: DO
3. Say FUCK YOU DRILL SEARGENT - I can make you go away. If i just do the task and finish as quick as possible, i don't have to hear your abusive fucking voice degrading me and filling me with guilt and anguish. REBEL AGAINST THE SARGENT. 

Yes. The ultimate act of rebellion is to rise against the fucking drill sargeant. Not rebel against the task, not rebel against authority, not rebel against the outside world. Abandon the drill sargent and abuse - AVOID HIM - by just doing the task. 

So now perhaps your ULTIMATE act of avoidance is avoidance of guilt, self-verbal abuse, and inner turmoil. You can avoid this horrible bullshit by just doing the task. 

Who could I be without the emotional abuse I put myself through? WHAT COULD I DO IF MY EMOTIONS WEREN'T AN OBSTACLE?  What could I do if I didn't have a constant oppressor on my back abusing me and judging me, being my worst enemy, and instead my inner voice supported me?  How can I avoid unhealthy avoidance by avoiding the source of pain, the Sargeant and his fucking abuse, by just doing the task?  

I don't feel like spellchecking all of my Sargeants so please excuse."
JordanPeterson,fein8uf,t1_fef7ozi,1579142494.0,"As opposed to ignoring trauma, anxiety, and depression and just hoping they go away? When a person goes sees a doctor or therapist, the protocol is to identify the issue, determine if there is a diagnosis to make, and then prescribe a solution, whether it be pharmacological or therapeutically.  

You wonder if our society is creating more trauma by focusing so much on it. If a friend or loved one came to you saying they're depressed or afraid of hurting themselves, would your response be ""you'll be creating more trauma for yourself if you try to find solutions for your condition, stop focusing on it because you'll just make it worse""?"

In corollary, Currently I'm working on stopping the judgment of my emotions. WHen I procrastinate or avoid or get into my unhealthy patterns, I beat myself up. Really hard. Like, I think of myself as a failure, I can't reach my goals, I'm incapable of XYZ ""simple"" task, why am I so deficient and incapable that I can't JUST DO THE DAMN TASK. I learned that when I procrastinate or avoid, this narrative reel starts playing in my head, so judgmental about my character and capability as a person.  These thoughts are paralyzing. Somewhere deep inside of myself, my tender feelings are getting their ass kicked by Judgmental Thought me.  It's like, imagine you're trying to do a productive task, and you have this negative drill sergeant right behind you yelling in your ear that you suck as a person and you're a failure and you're broken. Like, who the fuck could get anything done?? This inner drill sergeant is upsetting me, being verbally abusive and unfairly judgmental, and it's compromising my mood. So how do I get rid of the drill sergeant?  I check out... check out of myself, check out of my mind, check out of the task, procrastinate.  All while Drill Sergeant never really went away. It just gets louder like SEE!! YOU CHECKING OUT AND AVOID IS LITERALLY PROOF OF YOUR FAILURE. So then I get racked with guilt, I get so upset. The fucking drill sergeant seems to never go away. Some people check out by relying on alcohol, drugs, workaholic, shopping, food, etc. It's like it's the only relief. 

So I go back to my first question - what if there was no drill sergeant? What if I didn't have to do the emotional labor of taking the verbal abuse? What if I didn't have to avoid the drill sergeant (therefore avoiding the task at hand)? What if the drill Sargent turned into a cheerleader who supports me? WHAT IF MY EMOTIONS DID NOT GET IN THE WAY OF MY PROGRESS? 

So now... 

1. Look at the task at hand
2. Do not THINK about the task. Do not think about ""whether you should do it or not"".  Go immediately from sight to action - no internal questioning and battling against the drill sergeant. 
   1. By avoiding thinking about whether the task should be done or not, you avoid  the inner turmoil of ambivalence. By avoiding ambivalence, you avoid the Sergeant.  And by avoiding the Sergeant, you avoid the verbal abuse, the feelings of failure, the character attacks about what I can and cannot do, and the ensuing anxiety and depression for having to go through this fucking ENTIRE EMOTIONALLY DRAINING AND HURTFUL DRAMA - just because you have some laundry to do that you don't feel like doing. 
   2. Think about it this way: when I indulge in ""Thoughts About Whether I Should Do This Thing Or Not"", I invite the Sargeant in and it's verbal abuse. It's like this is the name of the Sargent.  Instead of it's name being Sargent Smith, his name is ""Sargent Should I Do This Task or Not"".  
   3. Recap: By entertaining the question about how you can avoid a task or whether it should even be done, you entertain the Sergeant and invite in the character judgment and abuse. ""I can't do this. I'm incapable. Why am I always failing?"" 
   4. DO NOT THINK: DO
3. Say FUCK YOU DRILL SEARGENT - I can make you go away. If i just do the task and finish as quick as possible, i don't have to hear your abusive fucking voice degrading me and filling me with guilt and anguish. REBEL AGAINST THE SARGENT. 

Yes. The ultimate act of rebellion is to rise against the fucking drill sargeant. Not rebel against the task, not rebel against authority, not rebel against the outside world. Abandon the drill sargent and abuse - AVOID HIM - by just doing the task. 

So now perhaps your ULTIMATE act of avoidance is avoidance of guilt, self-verbal abuse, and inner turmoil. You can avoid this horrible bullshit by just doing the task. 

Who could I be without the emotional abuse I put myself through? WHAT COULD I DO IF MY EMOTIONS WEREN'T AN OBSTACLE?  What could I do if I didn't have a constant oppressor on my back abusing me and judging me, being my worst enemy, and instead my inner voice supported me?  How can I avoid unhealthy avoidance by avoiding the source of pain, the Sargeant and his fucking abuse, by just doing the task?  

I don't feel like spellchecking all of my Sargeants so please excuse."

When a person goes sees a doctor or therapist, the protocol is to identify the issue, determine if there is a diagnosis to make, and then prescribe a solution, whether it be pharmacological or therapeutically.  

You wonder if our society is creating more trauma by focusing so much on it. If a friend or loved one came to you saying they're depressed or afraid of hurting themselves, would your response be ""you'll be creating more trauma for yourself if you try to find solutions for your condition, stop focusing on it because you'll just make it worse""?"

I appreciate it when people stop to compliment anything on me or about me. Always makes me smile, I don't take it as a creepy thing.  But that's just me. I've never been harassed nor abused. I know most women don't feel this way, this is just my own personal experience and perspective."
