schizophrenia,fgtu2zs,t1_fgtth5l,1581109333.0,"that's exactly what i did and it worked out. i had to hire a lawyer to get out, but once i did, everything was chillin. 

not saying that would work for everyone, i guess it depends on the severity of one's illness"
schizophrenia,fgtshcz,t1_fgtqjk9,1581108719.0,"you think just because someone experiences delusions, that automatically means they're a danger..? one of my closest friends who experiences full on auditory and visual hallucinations has NEVER taken medication, and they work a full-time career with no trouble managing the symptoms of their schizophrenia.

another study at harvard indicated that estrogen patches worked 35.6% (if i remember correctly) better than antipsychotics at reducing positive symptoms, yet we don't schizophrenia being treated with estrogen due to what.. probably pharma reps? psych wards exist to make money. they can def help people in crisis, but their main purpose is business in the end, it's naive to think otherwise, given the healthcare system currently in place.

also i have no problem with my current meds lol

i'm not suggesting OP shouldn't seek recovery, i'm just saying it's possible to lead a productive and happy life without medications, because i've literally witnessed it happen"
schizophrenia,fgtp8mn,t1_fgto7op,1581107601.0,"i was involuntarily committed due to an alleged psychotic episode (never got diagnosed with anything specific) and from what i can tell, schizophrenia affects everyone differently. fundamentally i don't think anyone should be forced to take medication they don't want for ANY reason as a human right - unless they are a legitimate danger to themself or others. 

i know damn well that SOME of my friends who are schizophrenic or schizoaffective are way better off without their medication, while others absolutely 100% need to take it in order to function. i really do think it depends on the individual & that doctors are wrong a lot; it can be a total crap shoot"
self,fgto5l1,t3_f0e22n,1581107193.0,how did this make me feel so warm inside yet utterly distraught :(
bipolar,fgtnr95,t1_fgt1gs9,1581106966.0,oh my god i hate that i can say i relate to this but HELL YEAHHH
bipolar,fgtllhg,t1_fgtc7yg,1581106164.0,"what medium do you practice with?? i love monochromatic drawing with a pen, but i suck at painting, collaging, sculpting, etc. if you haven't already, i would try to branch out in terms of the type of art you're making! usually at least one will stick out to you :-)"
schizophrenia,fgtl831,t3_f0ekyh,1581105937.0,"fuck em' and get out of there lol

as long as you're not gonna hurt yourself or anyone else, then no one should be forcing you to do anything you don't want to do.

i'm not schizophrenic but i lurk here frequently and from what i've seen on this sub & in real life, antipsychotics usually do way more harm than good. 

i know this is an unpopular opinion, but i believe everyone experiences reality in a different way, and just because you happen to be in a minority group doesn't mean you have to conform to everyone else's experience. 

being ""normal,"" and living a ""normal life,"" are vastly overrated. do what makes YOU happy"
schizophrenia,fgtjxd1,t1_fgt8a1v,1581105412.0,"underrated comment ^ 

very valuable input here. my parents are both undoubtably mentally ill (i'm not sure of the exact diagnosis so i won't try to guess) and between them they've made a couple million dollars over the course of my 24 years of life. 

i also know a lot of people in med school and a couple in medical departments of the gov (CDC FDA etc) who pretty much echo the sentiment of your comment: that contemporary western medicine is absolutely not the be all-end all of wellness, due to it being a billion dollar capitalistic industry. 

i also have a theory that wealthy people tend to describe their mild schizoaffective symptoms as ""synesthesia,"" which is undoubtably portrayed as a positive trait, while less fortunate people with the same exact symptoms get diagnosed as ""schizophrenic."" 

it's refreshing to see someone who shares some of these views !"
