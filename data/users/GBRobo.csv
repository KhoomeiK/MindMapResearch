Fulfillment comes from yourself, not other people or university course completion. As an engineer and an artist, I find creation is the best source of fulfillment. University simply gives you resources to create a career at great monetary and mental costs. Anxiety, depression, ADHD, and loneliness are common mental costs of University. (All IMO and experience)"

college,fdfspru,t3_el2mmt,1578369258.0,"Is it your intention to make an impression on the professor? Or are you thankful to specific professors for specific things? 

If you wish to make an impression, think a little more about what they did for you and, more importantly, what you can do for them as an engaged student. That way you can build a relationship with shared interests you can work together on. (This is how I landed a research opportunity as an undergraduate)

If you are writing from the heart for the sole purpose of thanking them, be specific so your details are useful for them.

Either way, just about anyone will appreciate a kind letter written to them."
