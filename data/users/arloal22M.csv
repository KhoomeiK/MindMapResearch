My dad routinely left a bucket of water outside for the roos to drink at night, one night my small Jack Russel X started barking & I let her out thinking it was a neighbourhood dog trespassing.  No, it was a red kangaroo bigger than me! She started chasing it, I freaked out knowing what they did to small animals, so I‚Äôm running after the both of them screaming at her to stop.  The Kangaroo turned & looked at me as if to say ‚Äúreally?‚Äù & bounded away."

AnimalsBeingBros,fd7cpen,t1_fd75yw2,1578202442.0,"The experts say that animals have ‚Äúsentience‚Äù

Sentience is the capacity to feel, perceive, or experience subjectively. ... In modern Western philosophy, sentience is the ability to experience sensations (known in philosophy of mind as ""qualia""). In Eastern philosophy, sentience is a metaphysical quality of all things that require respect and care.

So I‚Äôd say yes it‚Äôs showing concern, but also I see fear in those beautiful eyes.   We‚Äôve lost hundreds of thousands if not millions of these amazing animals during these catastrophic fires.  Yesterday alone in the Kangaroo Island fires (off South Australia) they estimate 50,000 koalas perished. The Island is famous for its pristine environment & unique wallabies."
