My advice to any man with any woman, don't set the precedent that you apologize for things that aren't transgressions.  You'll train a woman to walk all over you and  worse for both of you, she won't like you at all romantically once you've been turned into a simpering pet.

MensRights,fecosjr,t1_febvdsh,1578979388.0,"I don't get hung up on speculation as to shades of whiteness in antiquity.  Still, it's worth noting that when you're talking about the ""great Roman Empire"" you're talking about a white elite for the most part and most of the citizens too.  The impression today of Italians as darker or not as white stems from impressions of Sicilians and the south of Italy, especially after massive waves of rapes from Muslims bent on conquest.   Same goes for the Greeks of the golden period marked by figures like Archimedes and Aristotle and his student Alexander the Great.  France largely managed to keep Muslims out whereas Spain did succumb and centuries later expelled the Moors.  

For me the entire issue is culture really.  Genetics according to experts do play a big role in intelligence, but they don't determine necessarily anything about what a society values and strives to accomplish.  ""Western Culture"" has been different for thousands of years.  I'd say in broad strokes that the West has been first and foremost about pushing the physical boundaries and mental and spiritual ones.  Many other cultures, for good and bad, have sought harmony with the forces of nature and other cultures.  We also have examples of cultures which value a hyper militaristic society where the main path to glory is conquest.

Now, as of this year, I think the West is so decadent, so ignorant of its history, so confused about really basic things, that this century will probably see the end of it unless a real revival takes place.  And while some will cheer this development, it will actually be a great loss for everybody.

I used to talk to students about how ideas about science can vary in different cultures.  I gave the example of the Navajo people, the Dine, who believe that the souls of the elders reside in the beautiful and sacred stars above.  Since this is an eternal resting home it made perfect sense to them that nobody should stare, respect and honor their privacy.  This also meant almost nobody would ever look through a telescope or pursue such a course of study.

Now some things will just be speculative for now, but others are fairly obvious.  We don't have incredible viticulture from Muslim lands because Islam forbids intoxicating drink.  So they won't be openly tending vineyards risking the anger of imams or rulers.  It's forbidden.  End of story."

Tip1: Immediately set up an appointment with an academic advisor/guidance counselor.  Discuss your goals and plan your semesters/quarters accordingly. Use a planner or calendar to stay on top of important dates (add classes!).

Tip2: I only found out about this far too late, but I recommend you reach out immediately: the offices for disabled students (or however they phrase it).  Once they know you have a significant condition they can be your advocate if the need arises and sometimes they can make it less stressful for you in school.

Tip3:  Know what you want to study and why (sort of goes back to Tip 1).  Yes, I did graduate with honors and Phi Beta Kappa from a really well regarded university, but my strange resume (gaps due to hospitalizations and such) and background check issues makes me think I should probably have focused on the more practical parts of my education, i.e. more computer skills (have  some, but good jobs expect a lot usually).

Tip4:  Personally, I would not share my diagnosis with anybody until there was a clear reason why.  People can be so cruel and malicious.

Tip5:  I know a lot of the college experience is socializing with peers and networking.  I won't say be a loner and just focus on studies, but a friendly reminder that we should really not drink much ever and that it's crucial to keep our sleep schedules steady.

Tip6:  Try to plan your week.  I find that many of us are more easily distracted than the average person.  So block out time for studying and papers before you do things not related to your goals.

A state of  the art Navy cruiser entered the Gulf to help protect the ships there from any threats.  One fateful day the ship was dealing with smaller Iranian attacker, think speed boats with machine guns mostly and one  bigger vessel.
