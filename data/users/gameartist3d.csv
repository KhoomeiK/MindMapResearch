niceguys,fd4gmto,t1_fd26kzt,1578167335.0,The only issue i see with this tactic is that many girls will flirt once and then ghost. When I had tinder I would just delete the people who wouldnt respond after three days or so. This one time i matched with a girl who I had unmatched for this reason and she explained to me that she was at a family vacation or something but she was cool so I decided she'd be nice to talk to again. Unfortunately the date I had that day snatched me up so I had to ghost in the end.
