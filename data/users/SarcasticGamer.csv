He thought it was going to be non-stop action since that's how the trailer showed it. It's not to say it's a boring film, just very slow paced. There's a scene remonescent of a scene from SPR that happens less than halfway through but no blood is shown again until towards the end. There are no large scale battles with body parts flying around or people getting shot in the head or anything crazy."

PS4,ff3i89n,t1_ff2li82,1579541592.0,I enjoyed the new one but 3 was insanely epic. 3 did things never before seen on a damn PS3 10 years ago. The newer game didn't really bring anything new to the table or that hasn't been done before already.

Not close of business the next day like any other sane rental place. And if someone lost the movie then it cost a ridiculous amount to replace. Like 50 bucks or something. Everyone gets all nostalgic about going to a video store but if a new one opened up I doubt anyone would go to it.

Ben should have known his plan and there should have been an epic duel of the Emperor vs Rey and having her get angrier and angrier so she can strike him down full of rage for the plan to work. Then at the last moment before she does it Ben intervenens and gets killed instead or something. Who the hell wrote this movie?

DeathStranding,fehra04,t1_fegsv9i,1579122301.0,"It's biggest thing going against it is being a 1st party Sony game so there's a certain expectation that many people have when going in. It's a great game and I had a blast playing it but too many people were expecting a 10/10 and then being disappointing when it's a 7/10 as if that's a failure.
