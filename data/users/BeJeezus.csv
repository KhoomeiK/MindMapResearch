If that’s true it’s just *two* bad decisions: (1) they didn’t need a deal because we had evidence on tape and could have coerced any necessary testimony case by case, and (2) if the union fought the punishments and got them reduced or even overturned, the union would clearly be the bad guy and public support would be strongly on MLB’s side, which would be handy going into contract negotiations."

I’m afraid to wipe it, though, because none of the (few) third party apps are supported by developers anymore.

But even if they were, the ten year old apps are pretty primitive now, and it’d hurt to try to use daily.
