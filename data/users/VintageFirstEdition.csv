I just read the story and saw the picture and instead of laughing or saying “she’s crazy” right away, I asked myself “what could drive someone to this behavior?”"
trashy,ffd55cx,t3_eswbnt,1579813618.0,"I hope she’s not being abused at home by someone. Like some sociopathic narcissist who is trying to control her every move- but you can’t make someone not poop. Maybe she found that parking lot one day and went back because she didn’t get caught-maybe she’s crying in the picture because she knows she’s going to get a beating when she gets home. 
*This is all speculation- I watch a lot of true crime."

WaltDisneyWorld,ff5xshn,t3_erfurx,1579613747.0,I’m so sorry for your loss. I went after I had three surgeries and before I started chemo last August. I was there 8 days and I didn’t think about being sick once. Taking her to Disney was the greatest gift.
Ovariancancer,ff4rjmr,t3_er9f2b,1579570721.0,"Hi. I had Just turned 37 when I had my hysterectomy last summer. Recovery is as simple as remaining in bed for one month. The worst part is the hot flashes. They are horrible. But they told me they would be gone after 6 months. It’s been six months and they are less intense and happen infrequently. 
The biggest thing for me is loss of reproduction organs. I always wanted children, always. I know it’s not the cancers fault that I cant have children, I waited a long time. 
I wish you well, ultimately you’re fighting for your life, you just have to give up control of your body and let the doctors save you."
AskReddit,fev8kig,t3_eqies2,1579394415.0,"My first year of college (2000) I brought a little TV to the dorms. The remote went missing after winter break which was a pain in the ass, but you could change the channel and volume with the buttons on the tv. In the late spring I was walking to school on the other side of the road about five blocks away when the remote fell from the sky and smashed into my knee. 

This happened in Boston on Commonwealth Ave. It wasn’t the only freaky thing that happened there. 

Right before I went on winter break one of my teachers (art school) assigned a sheet of a block of blown up pixels for the class to repaint on canvases. When we returned from break he would put all the paintings together and we would have a big picture and we’d see an image. The teacher stressed how important the assignment was because we all had a different section to paint and if one person didn’t do the assignment it would be ruined for everyone. When I went to do the assignment I couldn’t find my sheet anywhere I spent all break looking and freaking out. When my parents brought me back to school there was no place to park or pull over near my dorm so I had them pull around the block. When I stepped out of the car I stepped into an ice covered puddle and my foot went right through and sitting at the bottom of the frozen puddle was my assignment sheet."

You know what makes a great planchet in a pinch is the glass top of a yankee candle. One of those flew off a coffee table and smashed right into my sternum."

todayilearned,fdffdse,t1_fdfebij,1578360406.0,"Her attitude was outstanding, you could tell she was beloved by every member of staff. She had a booming laugh. It’s probably incredibly selfish but as a person who is going through treatments and will survive my cancer it’s so scary to start a relationship with someone who will probably die from it. But I still might have time. Like I said I’ve been going through it the last few months and had my last chemo a week ago. My second life is just starting."

todayilearned,fdfchp4,t1_fdf6jdy,1578358448.0,"I just wanted to connect with someone! Cancer makes you feel so alone. I went out to the car and cried and cried. She said she was an inspirational speaker, so I figured she had her safety net. I suffered from PTSD FROM 9/11 and I know I would just not be able to handle that friendship. But I still think about attending her speeches."
todayilearned,fdf4dkw,t3_el02z0,1578353032.0,"I was at lunch a few months ago, and the waitress started talking about bringing her mother to chemo. I told her I have cancer and was going through treatments too. She then said she had cancer too! She was so upbeat about it. She described having at least five different cancers. I looked at her confused, and she said “I was a first responder on 9/11, homeland security”. She gave me a hug, and her phone number but I never called her.

Edit: Yikes, you guys are a bunch of hyenas. I was just telling the story as I heard it. I pulled out her name and number and googled her. She has a very unique name. It came up as 

Firstname Lastname: Homeland Security Verizon
TownILiveNear, StateILiveIn

I have NO IDEA what that means but I didn’t make up the story I have way more interesting 9/11 stories for you guys to call me a liar about."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdf3nzd,t1_fdf26pd,1578352572.0,"How about wishing he would die instead of thousands of young people who get drafted into a war they don’t want to fight? Or wishing he would die, instead of innocent people in a terrorist attack? I’m not arguing, it’s just a couple of thoughts that popped into my head, he is the one that gave the order to kill that guy right? That guy was a bad guy, so is Donald Trump. An eye for an eye?

Edit. What’s a neverTrumper?
Edit edit. I googled it. That’s the dumbest phrase for someone who doesn’t like Trump. 

Something you need to learn is that two people can have the same thought or thoughts. 
The brain is a magical place."

TwoXChromosomes,fc91klk,t3_egkqnk,1577545540.0,"I am so proud of you. I work in retail management and if this had ever happened in my store I would have called the police, then gone in there and grabbed the camera myself. I have proven to be fight instead of flight in past traumatic situations especially when it comes to the safety of customers and employees in my stores. When you walk into my store I feel like I’m in charge of your safety. I’m ashamed, but not surprised by the actions of the employees of the forever 21. A lot of mall stores have a very toxic work environment and they looked at you and your problem and said “not my problem”. I’m sorry."
