NoStupidQuestions,ff31xi6,t3_er1vm8,1579531532.0,"I used to be a property manager. My voicemails were forwarded as voice-detected texts.  I saw immediately if there was an issue that needed prompt attention. 

But often it was stuff like wanting to get a fifth dog. Or whether or not they could move out 5 months early. Or if their friend’s family could move in for 2 months. Or if I would please put screens on the windows so they could open the windows for the three weeks in Texas that allows for that...

I don’t want to take that call on the fly because I have difficulty saying “no.”  If I do say “no,” then I ramble on about random stuff because i feel bad. 

So if I read the message, I can take a moment to establish a position, call right back and just say “no.” Or that it’s ok with additional $200 deposit. That often helps people figure out how much of a priority the pet is in a building shared by 8 units."

online_tefl,feaohll,t3_enspca,1578950847.0,"Thank you all for the input. I am a licensed real estate agent. I have always helped new agents develop their skills to get their business growing. The more I help, the better things work out for me somehow. 
When I signed on with Keller Williams, they offers profit share for agents that I referred to KW (or vice versa). But their was no bonus right away. 
My monthly profit share came with two conditions: 1- the whole office had to be profitable. And 2- the referred agent had to be producing (successfully producing). 
So I had an incentive to do what I was already doing, and it encouraged me to get more systematic about helping and checking in. Plus, it encouraged me to assist all the other new or experienced agents in the office, since we had to be profitable. 
Leaky faucet? That’s my concern. 
Someone leaves the AC on- my concern. 
It really was rewarding in more ways than just money. 
It seems wholesome. 
That’s what i was hoping for. It really could be a win-win-win for the recruiter, the referred and the company (and the students!)"
