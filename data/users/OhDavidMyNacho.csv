exmormon,ff7p43j,t3_es00f2,1579654920.0,"I'm going to go against the grain here. 

She's your mom. It seems like you love her, and you want to know what you can do to help. 

My advice is to talk to your siblings. Get them to at least calm enough of their shit, that it isn't in your mom's face all the time. 

Think back to how you felt as a child. Knowing nothing, getting confused when seeing others perform complex tasks easily. Life has no handbook. I'm sure you can look around at your peers and see many of them more and less ""successful"" than you. 

Think about your mom in that same frame. She also had no handbook, she is also blindly going through life trying to do the best she can. Yeah, she joined a religion that you ended up leaving. Maybe you're seen as a disappointment because of this. I was in the same boat. Though I left the church at 19 and moved out at 21. 


As an example, at 22-23, I was young, dumb, a college dropout, and loving my simple life. My mother, at that same age, was a few months shy of being pregnant with her second child. If I was on her timeline, at 29, I'd be on my 7th kid, pregnant with the 8th. She once talked with me about an issue I was having, and tried giving me some advice. And that's when I realized I had more real-world experience then my mom. And I was looking for her help. So imagine how life must have been for her growing up and knowing even less than that?

This is why you need to cut your mom some slack and tell your siblings to scale it back a little. Life is too short to allow the mistakes of a young adult, decide that you have no relationship with your mom."

The bishops changed at one point. And the new bishop did not want to keep giving us orders for the storehouse. And effectively cut us off because of it. Not due to unworthiness, but simply because in his eyes, it had gone on long enough. It didn't matter that she was recently divorced, worked 3 jobs and spoke poor English.

Simply reading Nietzche, and ascribing to his moral philosophy isn't enough. Because as much good as can be found within his writings, there is also quite a lot of bad that comes with it. 

I'm also coming from the perspective of typical Utah counter culture. Where generally people go to extremes after leaving the church. For example, in Utah, if you go to a party and not drink, everyone jokingly asks if you're Mormon. Just about anywhere else, people will instead offer you something else. The inverse is also true, when living outside of Utah, no one cared that I had non-member friends. But in Utah, it was something to gossip about.
