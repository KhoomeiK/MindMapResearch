First, she is taking you home to meet her fam. So she isn't hiding anything. 

Second, this is SIX MONTHS AWAY and you are giving her a rough time about this now? 

More than controlling this is simply emotionally abusive. Is the plan to badger her for several months with your judgement and insecurity? Is this something you have a history of doing? This behavior is sure to drive anyone away.
