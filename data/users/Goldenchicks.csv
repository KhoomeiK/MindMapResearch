MeatRabbitry,ffjdgay,t1_ffjc5ca,1579995953.0, She seems to more often than not kindle on day 31 or 32. If I give her the nest box on day 27 I always have to fix it up again arou d day 30 because she kicks most of the hay out and pees in it. This is her smallest litter yet. I'm not sure if it's just her or our buck.

AskReddit,ffddid8,t3_eszstl,1579818596.0,"I think it depends on the person and the situation. Inwas going through a separation with my husband, couldn't afford rent and bills and my car had just broken down. I was freaking out, depressed, feeling pretty hopeless. I called a friend of mine and cried to him on the phone. He was sympathetic for sure but said crying isn't going to fix any of those problems so I needed to pick myself up and figure out my next step. It was the words I needed. He would have flown to my city and hugged me and all that if he could but honestly that wasn't going to really help either. I needed to get my shit together and so I did."
explainlikeimfive,ffd2pql,t1_ffc1fd1,1579812247.0,I think so. The idea is that the potential to spread a possible disease or illness to the officer is dangerous for the officer. All of the cases we had involved spitting but Last Podcast On The Left was just talking about a different fluid that a man was able to produce while fighting off a bunch of officers. I would think if any got on them that would add to his charges as well.
AskReddit,ffbypy3,t1_ffbxww2,1579786982.0,"A friend of mine tells how her husband peed in her purse once and in the dishwasher once. I think his ""sleepwalking"" happens after heavy drinking."
AskReddit,ffbyaz8,t3_est2yy,1579786634.0,As long as you don't stick your tongue out or have your mouth open. I have a couple of FB friends that can't seem to close their mouths when taking a selfie.
AskReddit,ffby5nu,t3_est36g,1579786508.0,I enjoy making pine needle baskets. I'm not in an area with the right kind of pine trees and the closest park that I know of that has the right trees is 45 min away. It's not that big of a deal but I do have to drive over there to collect them when I run out.
explainlikeimfive,ffbxw0g,t3_est3a6,1579786281.0,I don't have a good answer but don't ever spit at an officer either! I did grand jury once and we had several instances where someone spit on a police officer and that was a felony.

AskReddit,ff50y0b,t3_erobkn,1579577277.0,Latex. Luckily it's a fairly mild allergy unless it's in an area of higher blood flow. Then I swell wherever I have come in contact with it otherwise it's just a rash. Doctors have said that one day I might just go into anaphylactic shock when coming in contact with it. They always give me examples of people they work with that also have a minor reaction and then one day just go into anaphylactic shock.

AskReddit,ff3jk2n,t3_erg7vg,1579542408.0,I woke up one morning and told my husband that I felt I needed to go sed my grandfather immediately. I had to load up and get the oil changed before driving the 6 hours one way to see him. Unfortunately I didn't make it in time to see him. He had been suck so it wasn't a huge surprise though.
cats,ff3if4w,t3_erg92o,1579541710.0,If keeping all 3 is an option I'd do that. If the older one is an indoor/outdoor cat then that may make it a little easier for them to all live happily in the space. I have indoor and outdoor cats but currently none that do both. Back when I did though the ones that were both indoor and outdoor got along okay. They didn't fight but they didn't hang out either. Cats can usually live in a space without fighting much. In the past when introducing cats they might have one little scrap and then they were fine with each other.
AskReddit,ff2zz5g,t1_ff2ztqh,1579529945.0,Haha! That made me actually lol. Now I have to share this with my husband.

AskReddit,ff2wdql,t1_ff2vg3r,1579526664.0,I associate the taste of the toothepaste with a clean and fresh mouth so that is the best starting point.
AskReddit,ff2utzg,t1_ff2ufoq,1579525039.0,Well maybe if they are showed regularly and so bathed regularly or something they might not mind so much. I don't raise show rabbits so I'm not usually bathing them. They tend to take care of cleaning themselves pretty well like cats.
AskReddit,ff2ui5a,t3_ercouc,1579524671.0,I always brush before coffee or anything. I want to have a clean mouth before drinking coffee or anything so I have a nice clear flavor not contaminated by gross morning breath or anything. I don't usually brush after because I usually don't eat till already on our way to a job.

AskReddit,ff2u3f1,t3_ercp3d,1579524214.0,Well my day is just getting started but yesterday I had to give one of our rabbits a bath because she had managed to make a mess of herself. Rabbits don't care to get wet. They probably like the hair dryer even less and it takes forever to get their fur dry.

homestead,ff0zn19,t1_ff0yp8t,1579473796.0,The goats have always wanted to be with the chickens. Even when we first got the goats as babies and they had a house on the opposite side of the pasture they would sleep right beside the coop door. The goats even get very upset when we forget to open the chicken coop. They will yell at us till we go do it.
homestead,ff0yzus,t1_ff0r6w8,1579473679.0,Thank you! I'm not sure. If I fell dead right there they would definitely eat all the treats before feeling bad about it.

mildlyinteresting,fezpiqw,t3_er09m2,1579460040.0,I still have a sealed vhs of Titanic somewhere. I think I told my mom it was a good movie so she bought it for me. I didn't need or want to see it again.

homestead,fezm5jj,t1_fezk9e3,1579458893.0,Where we used to live it used to just be the chickens and we didn't have the seperate fenced pasture so the chickens eventually just camped out on the patio in the evenings when I usually came out. They could tell time really well. Lol

mildlyinfuriating,feynhnc,t3_eqx7nz,1579447977.0,We did a puzzle last year that had a missing piece. I just assume if fell off the table and the dog ate it. This is much more confusing though.

AskReddit,fesh96f,t3_eqi5sp,1579365084.0,"My bf at the time (now husband) and I were friends with another bf/gf couple in high school. We hung out nearly daily. The girl and I used to volunteer and play conasta at a senior center. We were there when they had their baby. I even moved in with her while her husband was in the army to help out with the new baby which meant moving to a different city away from my bf. Anyway, obviously really close friends. So after I moved back home to my bf she freaking turned into another person. She found religion again and told her bf (at this point husband who was a Taoist and had been since before she met him) while he was in Korea that he had to accept Jesus Christ as his savior and give her power of attorney or she was filing for divorce and taking their kid. He was a medic in Korea so I can't imagine the crap he dealt with and then had this on top of it. 
She did thousands of dollars of damage to their apartment and wrote hot checks to everyone in their name. She then took some info she had on another friend and opened an account at a jewelry store in another state and ran up a bill there which he found out when he went to buy a car and bad credit popped up. 
She also told her now exs family that we helped her kidnap their kid and run off to another state which we never did and hadn't even talked to her in years when we found that out."
