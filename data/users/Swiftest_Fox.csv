aww,ff66qn1,t1_ff5qvmc,1579620461.0,"I didn't know this was a common trait for certain breeds. My Husky does this. Different gifts can have meanings too. Shoes mean he needs to potty, but socks he gives us for attention and napkins/paper when he wants treats. He brings us other random stuff too. Never had a dog that gave gifts before. He does give them too, he brings the gift directly to a person and tries to put it in their hands.

My Aussie is the no-take-only-throw type so I was really surprised by my huskies behavior."

worldnews,ff3o9dp,t3_erfcm7,1579545308.0,"Work life balance is a big deal in corporations now. It's supposed to be a perk for hiring and with corporations getting attacked for a lack of that balance I'm not surprised that a truly hard worker, who is more willing to give up that balance would not be as valuable as they once were.

If those people threaten other people's balance then they really get hell. So they end up doing a lot of work themselves because they can't let it go."
atlassian,fenanon,t3_cy0mw1,1579280606.0,"They do have an official Confluence Admin class now at Summit, last April was the very first time they offered it. I took it because my company uses Confluence without Jira as an intranet for our 5000+ employee company, and we couldn't find any Atlassian partners who were Confluence Certified to help us support it. When I first started working with confluence 3 years ago there was almost no support because Confluence was viewed as a companion for Jira. That's getting better now, people don't just assume we use Confluence with a Jira environment. Within the last 2 years they have started Enterprise support as well, so even though Confluence has been around a long time it is just now starting to break out on its own. You could be one of the few people that have a Confluence Cert when people start using it for more then Jira Documentation. :)"
