offmychest,fffq3gs,t1_fffoh9h,1579889350.0,"Okay. So you walking away isn't running away. You walking away is acknowledging that you need time to process what's being said and work past your anger. Whatever emotions that come first arent one's you should act or speak on. Some people cry or get scared, if you need time to let that pass theres nothing wrong with it and other people should give you space to do that. Also, effective communication is not about blame. I would never just tell my bf he did something wrong. I would explain for example that he had hurt my feelings with whatever he said, we would discuss why that hurt me. We would work through together if what he said was actually bad or if it had just triggered something. We all have baggage and damage that follows us. 

You cant make someone better by just telling them they did wrong. You can't expect someone to just change their coping mechanisms because you think they should. 

You weren't asking him to bottle his emotions, you're not telling him to stop feeling you're asking him to give you space to understand and process. You're human, you need an explanation for what happened so that you can change your behaviour. If the person doesn't speak right away then you give them time. If they dont understand, you change how you explain. I've worked with and helped a lot of abuse survivors, they all just accept when someone tells them they're bad or they get angry because they dont understand why they're bad. 

It doesn't sound like a healthy dynamic to me, more like he wanted you to just be different and that's not how people work. You have to accept someone before you can help them to change."
offmychest,fffmsm3,t1_fffl8ks,1579887331.0,"So I hate being told I'm wrong, my boyfriend gives me space, let's me calm down and then tries again. He tells me how what I did made him feel rather than that I was wrong. If anger is your defensive mechanism then you need to learn to let it pass before you react. It that means leaving to calm down, do that. If it means someone leaving you so you can chill then do that. It's fine wanting someone to be better but you have to give them the tools to do that."

offmychest,ffezrnt,t3_eta0sm,1579871613.0,"It sounds like you have a lot of issues. I know a little of what's it's like to feel your only value is as an object. It started when I was 18, I'm pretty and my power was in the way I looked. You have to accept it will always be part of you, you'll always be part that. It's okay to be desired and good at sex, it's okay to own that. Humans are physical creatures but you can find true affection, you just have to know yourself. Develop yourself, feel as strong about your non sexual self as you do about the sexual side. Whether positive or negative you have strong feeling, maybe you even hate it. Acceptance of that side and improving the other will help. My value isnt just in the way I look, it's an enclosure to my amazing mind. I'm smart, funny, caring and have the ability to help people. Those things are as important, more so for a relationship. You have to be reslilient in dating, hard with people sometimes. You have to make them see you by being honest about who you are from day one, learn to see who people really are and dont accept second best."

They just see you as a person, not a beloved child and you wont matter until you they want something. You're allowed to feel like you feel but I think for your own emotional health you should start to reframe them in your mind and emotions. r/raisedbynarcissists might help"

If something makes you happy and the person you're with doesn't do that, there are 7.7 billion people on the planet, go find a new one. We're forced by society into this delusion that there is one true love and that love can only be had with this one person. 

I've dated a lot, I've been married and divorced. I'm now happy, why? because I didn't compromise on my deal breakers. When I got married I settled for the guy, I figured it was love right? It was special. Nope, you can love anyone really as long as there is something to love but adoration, companionship and friendship are so important and for those you need compatibility. I trawled through the dating sites for someone who liked as many of the things I liked as possible, for someone who agreed with as much of my politics, opinions and topics of interest as possible. Someone who wanted the same things in life, someone who was different in interesting ways, not incompatible ways.  Someone who was open emotionally and communicational. 

People think love is special, it's not. Trust is special, a fluid conversation is special, taking interest in the same things is special. Don't spend your life half-arsed in a relationship you have to work at like it's a job you hate."

They may be terrified of failing the thing they love or scared that they made the wrong choices, people change so much over time. Things you want now might not be things you want later. You're 19, your life is literally just starting and the stress young people put on themselves to be a cog in the machine is nuts. 

You are free, you could find a job in travel and go partying for a few years, you could work in a store and just save money, you could change majors a few times and try things out. You dont have to decide, there isn't a checklist and no one will pat you on the back at the end of your life for it. Be happy, follow what you love, that's all life is."

Sometimes you feel like you cant draw boundaries.  sometimes you feel helpless in life and push that onto something else so you control what you can. Guilt is a useless emotion, either accept what you did and move on or fix it."
offmychest,fe0z0i4,t3_enl828,1578820566.0,Maybe try and figure why you feel this way?
sex,fe0ypy5,t3_enl9ur,1578820431.0,Trying to make it go away isnt exactly a healthy step in a relationship. You might feel sad or insecure but forcing it away and making her hide her feelings will just lead to bad things later. If you dont trust her not to act on it then break up.
offmychest,fdy7mbg,t3_end5bh,1578776907.0,"Yeah you probably shouldn't have been a parent. I'm not being a dick lol some people, most actually just shouldn't raise other humans. I'm I'm r/childfree, one reason is all the things you just mentioned. I have a lot of experience with kids, just to reassure you shes not doing ""toddler things "" to annoy you  she just a toddler and they are annoying. They needs constant, consistent correction and its exhausting. You dont have to like it, you probably never will. Is there any way your partner could stay at home with her? You work? 

My advice is to try and take time for you as much as you can, be honest with your kid and teach her quiet time where she does her own thing, speaks in a low voice etc, they do learn, it's just needs to be consistent and repetitive. Try to learn skills to help yourself, breathing techniques, positive thinking and find a community that accepts you. The childfree reddit is open and there is a Facebook page about regretting your kids. It's okay to regret it, you're only human. You're not a monster, you just made a mistake that sadly you cant undo. 

Lastly, if you want to leave her and the life you have that's okay too. Maybe one day she'll understand but you only get one life and while she is yours and your responsibility but you only get one life. Use it well."

childfree,fdxqpgm,t3_enakbx,1578771920.0,"Yep! I learned being selfless makes you miserable. You're always doing things because others want you to and most people don't appreciate it, they always want more. I've slowly removed people like that. I only have friends now who are kind and caring but are also a little selfish. I have decided it's the best way to be, only be selfless if you really care and if not it doesn't mean anything, so I'm only selfless when I really care for the person. The rest of my life is for me."

Could she not stay with you, does she absolutely have to go back? Could she not pretend she was sick or something and can't travel? Are there no abuse charities in your country? There might be a specific reddit for your country. There are reddits for r/abuse or r/domesticviolence, r/Iwantout is dedicated to leaving countries, it may help. I wish you luck."
DeadBedrooms,fdxkwma,t3_enantr,1578769951.0,Try what you can but remember after a point its cruel to ask someone for something they're incapable of giving you and some people really just dont have it in them to be sexually spontaneous.

offmychest,fdxikdc,t3_enb2pb,1578769040.0,"Take some time. The worst thing you can do is rush into a decision. Tell him if he really wants you, he needs to give you space and time but you're not sure how long that will be. Take a month, tell him you'll contact him when you are ready to talk but not to contact you before then. The biggest issue I have with breaching trust is that people rush back in because they miss the person, sure you're going miss them, of course you love them emotions aren't switches they're streams. They flow and course through you and only time will give you the perspective you need."

That its not fair to put that responsibility on others. I think of the people I love and I try to treat myself as good as I treat them.
