modernwarfare,ffcizvx,t3_esj50a,1579800484.0,Similar results can be achieved with an fmj pkm. Launchers just suck tbh.
modernwarfare,ffciefm,t3_estpy2,1579800123.0,Only on shipment. Pretty easy to avoid otherwise. If you die to a gas on a normal map then the person could have just as easily killed you with a stun or flash since battle hardened doesn't do much against those and if you rush into a room after gassing you are affected by your own gas as well.
modernwarfare,ffb1igk,t1_ff9qo77,1579749460.0,I wonder if getting 5 kills and quitting out counts. Might be quicker. Kinda wish it was just total kills based or headshots based or something.
forhonor,ff3p35g,t1_ff3n3bg,1579545808.0,What do you mean? New to Jiang Jun.
forhonor,fet6so6,t3_eqj34v,1579372298.0,Single pick is necessary for read based combat to be at its best.
forhonor,fekxqiy,t3_epo378,1579209780.0,Her kick not having forward movement at all is the most annoying thing. That attack whiffs more than any other attack even if they fail to dodge and are just backpedaling sometimes. I'd like to see something done too because she's fun when she works but against people that just block all her lights I feel like I don't exist in the match.
forhonor,fekwz33,t1_fei4zeq,1579209329.0,"Considering his guard stance was in the wrong direction, no he was just randomly zoning for damage like many wardens do. He saw the highlander ""miss"" with the backstep light and decided to attack, as a lot of people often do when not expecting the fast HA chain heavy."
forhonor,fekvho5,t3_epm4j2,1579208447.0,"I'm excited for single pick to be hitting breach. My biggest gripe is that a read based combat system gets a lot more annoying when you can't remember which of 3 people playing the same character have a tendency to.

I have like 2-3 characters that I enjoy anyways so I'm super cool with this."
forhonor,fegrlvu,t1_feg7tsf,1579100910.0,His side bash is gb safe before and after. If he side dodges on red your gb will bounce off like most dodge attacks and his recovery is very low so if you dodge attack on reaction to his bash he can still parry you and can even cgb.
modernwarfare,fefob51,t1_fee4zfc,1579060741.0,I say the same thing about camo challenges and just all cosmetic challenges in general. I used to grind that stuff years ago but now I just play to have fun and am a much happier person as a result. Trying to stress over silly luck based or badly designed challenges just isn't worth the toll it takes on your limited time to have fun.
modernwarfare,fefnzxt,t1_fee1py1,1579060532.0,I've been killed by my own trophy system sometimes though and lost a flag over it. I wish you didn't take damage from it blocking the explosive.
forhonor,fefboqt,t3_eorjho,1579052794.0,"Yeah I also got it during the psplus release and chilling at 33 days.

It's been a long painful journey grinding to learn how to play this efficiently compared to other multiplayer games. Especially with the character differences to keep in mind as you fight them. I have zero background in fighting games so maybe that doesn't help since I am more used to the simplicity of shooters.

There were so many times over the year where I felt like I had finally gotten good at the game only to be thrust into a higher bracket and realize I know nothing as I got my butt kicked."
forhonor,fefat6l,t3_eomvnv,1579052217.0,Man that cent pin woulda killed you if you were most other characters. Gosh I hate cent in ganks when he just makes your revenge obsolete but I also hate rocksteady.
forhonor,fefaap8,t1_fedoiau,1579051880.0,It's also his bash which isn't punishable and he can just side dodge bash your attacks on red to get into his mixup or avoid damage.
CompetitiveForHonor,feee0qi,t1_feeamcc,1579031816.0,Glads side dodge shield bash always messes up my day since you can't punish it like you would a normal dodge attack and then the stun from it usually makes me take a toe stab or feint gb. Nets him like 25-35 damage for dodging an attack.
modernwarfare,fedmo0i,t3_eokqjz,1579015259.0,"Yeah this is completely normal. Shields on back block shotguns from front somehow, it's really annoying."
forhonor,fe9d52h,t1_fe96dbg,1578936485.0,"Understandable. I see both sides here though because it's very easy to be sabotaged by teammates doing silly things like throwing lights at external guard and feeding revenge or not playing the objective and dying somewhere in no mans land, leading to a loss(big problem in breach)and then you feel punished for what your teammate did when you probably should have won the fight/match in the given scenario. I've really seen some people throw games hard when we had a huge lead and had the win in the bag. It's depressing.

And on the other hand some mistakes are very easy to make and For Honor isn't exactly easy to be well and efficient at for most players compared to a lot of other more casual multiplayer games."
forhonor,fe960m6,t1_fe8vgcl,1578934650.0,I see you are unfamiliar with the nightmare that is solo queueing. Especially when you go against coordinated partied up people.
technology,fe4dpx0,t1_fe4apsx,1578858196.0,"It was also focused on why white rice is bad and you came in saying ""believe it or not you can eat rice and be healthy"" which was really condescending considering that was exactly what I had already said. Gmo stuff aside, golden rice very well still could be worse than other rices assuming you don't have a vitamin A deficiency because as I said before the article gives no information on if it goes through the same process as white rice. Not to mention if it's just white rice with vitamin A added in then it would certainly be lacking in some of the powerful antioxidants and nutrients found in other rice types.

The person I replied to was asking how to get it in America, which told me he was seeking healthier alternatives so I gave him some extra options with a short educational comment on the different types of rice. I only went into slight detail on why the other ones are better in case he doesn't want an information overload while still pointing in the right direction so he knows what to research if he does end up having a genuine interest he wants to pursue."
technology,fe46ynl,t1_fe454ck,1578856355.0,"I understand what it's for hence I referenced the article but even if it is for the vitamin A that that doesn't give any guarantee that it isn't also genetically modified to resist pesticides so you have no knowledge on what was used on it. Going non gmo entirely is the only way to be completely sure if you want to be extra safe.

And yes you can be healthy with rice but white rice is just as bad as white flour since the bran and germ is removed so it has less fiber and protein, you are essentially eating it in an unnatural state and if you want to eat healthier you most certainly should seek more nutrient dense whole rices such as brown, black, and red.

Also I already suggested how to be healthy while still eating rice so I'm not sure why you are repeating what I already said. It's almost like you didn't actually read my comment or understand that the purpose was to inform those who have better options.

In no way did I recommend against using it for those that don't have other options, in fact I clarified that in the very beginning."
PSNow,fe45of7,t3_eelumg,1578856057.0,Do you have Amazon there? I usually buy cards online using Amazon and they just send you the code rather than a solid card.
CompetitiveForHonor,fe3bmmc,t3_eniy27,1578847820.0,I thought last stand was bad since it's only active when in critical health. I'd rather run vengeful barrier/Bastion or vengeful barrier/bulk up.
CompetitiveForHonor,fe32j4s,t1_fe2ugvn,1578845270.0,I thought his dragon dodge had a fair amount of gb vulnerability in the beginning though so I didn't expect it to be that reliable. Kind of want to see one of these play out now.
technology,fe2vvtc,t1_fe0jki9,1578843387.0,"It doesn't sound like something that should be sought after if you have better options but I understand in some places you have to take what you can get.

Firstly the article doesn't mention if the bran and germ is removed which is one thing that makes traditional white rice so bad for you but since it's implied to be a substitute I assume it is, which problematically leads to blood sugar imbalances due to the worse fiber to carb ratio.

Secondly the fact it's gmo means you will likely be eating toxic pesticides since part of the point of gmo is to make plants not die from these things but our bodies aren't able to survive without consequences to these chemicals unlike the plants that had to be modified to be able to.

If you live in the US avoiding rice in general is a good idea since it tends to have traces of arsenic, but if you really want rice try to find black rice if you can as it is the most nutrient dense variety, followed by red and brown rice, not to be confused with fried rice and mexican rice which are both just white rice made differently.

But if you *really* want to keep gmo products in your diet, which is difficult to avoid in America even if you want to, then at least put cruciferous vegetables in your diet since those specifically cleanse toxins from your liver that you would be getting from these products. And adding more fiber to supplement for the lesser fiber content of common varieties of white rice would be a good idea as well."
todayilearned,fdtn689,t1_fdsjxvy,1578719193.0,"With youtube premium you can do background listening and it's pretty cheap. I just make playlists of music on there and never have to worry about downloading so if I get a new phone all my songs are still there and there's the plus of no more ads on any videos.

Also YT will have a lot of musics that aren't on spotify but I suppose the reverse would also be true.

YT has radio stations too like the lofi channel."
CompetitiveForHonor,fdr1aua,t1_fdiz2hw,1578678144.0,From what I remember it was a very small change that made the side deflect window go from 30something ms to 66ms. Still way too small and inconsistent. End up dodging attacks still so I just don't bother using the mechanic at all.
CompetitiveForHonor,fdr0wxp,t1_fdki2vu,1578677987.0,How do you tell if it will activate on death before they are dead?
CompetitiveForHonor,fdr0tmz,t1_fdkesa8,1578677930.0,How do you anti-gank as Tiandi? Is his zone just good or something?
modernwarfare,fdp98mj,t3_emcpjn,1578622973.0,There just needs to be spawn protection for a few seconds against it. Shipment is the only map it's a problem and Battle Hardened being a sucky perk isn't a good excuse to nerf it.
todayilearned,fdnt4vy,t1_fdnmggm,1578592307.0,That didn't seem too weird aside from the woman laying on the ground but I know of the stereotype you are referring to with the rolling on the ground and involuntary falling over and stuff but Assemblies of God Pentecostals don't do any of that stuff. It's a completely different denomination when you see this kind of stuff.
todayilearned,fdnsnle,t1_fdnsm8h,1578592031.0,Why do you say that?
todayilearned,fdnfk5t,t1_fdnezl1,1578584737.0,Assemblies of God Pentecostals are the nicest bunch of people you'll ever meet too. They have great youth groups that try to treat you like family. Been to a couple in different cities and never had a bad experience.
modernwarfare,fdmf977,t1_fdmew9u,1578547949.0,O yeh.
modernwarfare,fdmex1r,t3_elxd9g,1578547643.0,I believe the 12 tic rate servers are part of the reason for this and other problems.
modernwarfare,fdmetfs,t1_fdlz90z,1578547552.0,Having the whole map smoke so you can't see the enemy until they are 2 feet in front of you sounds really fun and scary actually. Haven't managed to get a smoke heavy lobby on shipment yet.
modernwarfare,fdmek1k,t3_em2njw,1578547319.0,"Honestly the nade is actually completely fine except in shipment but that's not the nades fault, shipment is just a crappy map that forces you to take nades whereas in a normal map gas is going to have less use outside of zoning. 

It's not even good for dealing with campers in a lot of cases since as soon as you run into the room you will start coughing too.

They could just disable gas nades in shipment or give spawn protection against it and everyone would be gucci."
modernwarfare,fdmegi9,t3_em0gjv,1578547231.0,"Bro just play core, the ttk is so quick that it's basically HC anyways."
modernwarfare,fdme6et,t1_fdlg0dx,1578546986.0,It's stupid fast weapon xp though. I was always super excited to see that map during double weapon xp times. Made grinds go by so much faster.
modernwarfare,fdipjkg,t1_fdiowl5,1578448153.0,Dang I thought so. That actually makes it a bit better imo.
modernwarfare,fdip35o,t3_elkkbe,1578447864.0,Dang just make a paintball themed map and make it look like this.
modernwarfare,fdip07n,t1_fdiomlx,1578447812.0,Shoot all the more reason for maxing out that ads I guess so you spend less time in that half ads zone where bullets are worthless.
modernwarfare,fdioour,t3_elesb6,1578447609.0,Is kilo more of a laser than M4? Always seems super accurate.
modernwarfare,fdio2pb,t1_fdi75u5,1578447216.0,Yeah I could believe that because honestly if I'm like 75% adsed and shoot with the model I always get hitmarkers from short distance as if I was hipfiring but when full ads it will kill twice as far.
modernwarfare,fdinwgc,t1_fdi9dsy,1578447104.0,Has someone done a video on this? I just saw this same thing in a youtube comment today and wondering where it started.
forhonor,fdi3k7m,t3_eld15t,1578435109.0,There's some $30 paddles you can buy for PS4 controllers that let you map zone to one button. Works well but I stopped using it because getting used to new additional buttons was confusing me.
forhonor,fdi35c7,t3_eleivl,1578434891.0,"I hope more characters that can counter bashes become available. Got tired of side dodge bash characters like conq and am playing bp to flip them but oddly he's a bash character himself.

I think bash dodges would be less frustrating if they didn't also protect from gb feints since you already can't parry them."
modernwarfare,fdcupzn,t3_ekmcuq,1578284857.0,Akimbo M19s would be pretty fun. That gun is better than people give it credit for. The spammy fire rate feels pretty fun up close.
modernwarfare,fdcswjf,t3_ekn5uc,1578283390.0,I noticed when you spawn your screen shows some blood as if slightly hurt just from the smoke alone even if nowhere near the flares. Does anyone know if this is just visual? I was thinking it might make guns kill in one less bullet or something which would give it some use in core since it would function like giving stopping power to your whole team.
modernwarfare,fdcsou1,t1_fd9wkm0,1578283216.0,"C flag in vacant you can also call in care package through the window on the roof. The railings aren't solid and it will fall right through. 

Probably intentional so you aren't stuck being unable to use a streak due to what side you are spawning on."
modernwarfare,fdcrmze,t1_fdae3tc,1578282359.0,"Or y'know the fact that controller is just harder, but yeah I'm not meaning to deligitimize entirely what was done on the clip. I'm aware pc has many players that wouldn't be able to do something like this."
modernwarfare,fd4v7fk,t1_fd4nrnw,1578171394.0,"A sniper is much different from a pistol but even so it would be significantly easier to do consistently with a mouse since the tool is capable of so much precision whereas on console it's sometimes just luck like when someone gets 360 no scope.

This man was using an iron sighted deagle though which is hard to aim with. But people like Drift0r who play on both platforms will openly say snapping headshots with the revolver and deagle is easier on pc but inconsistent with a controller and recommends just aiming for the 2 tap if on console."
modernwarfare,fd3gkk1,t1_fd2krq7,1578158156.0,"He didn't say it was easy, just that having the mouse enables plays like this."
modernwarfare,fd3gbla,t1_fd2cz1w,1578158071.0,PC still has a higher skill ceiling though. If the pc player and console player are bad it can go either way but a really good pc player will usually beat a really good console player. The way this guy was snapping perfect deagle headshots with a high sensitivity is something you are much less likely to see on console.
FinalFantasy,fcwevjy,t1_fcvwcsy,1578023846.0,Halflife has antlions too so I was pretty confused at first. Also your username offends me.
CompetitiveForHonor,fcsysjc,t1_fcpa7va,1577928504.0,Not really free. If you make the read that someone will feint their unblockable into a gb instead of fallimg for the parry and choose to go for a backdodge instead of damage then good for you. You. You earned it. Better that way so people think before randomly guardbreaking from neutral.
CompetitiveForHonor,fcsyk5l,t1_fcsxw6c,1577928342.0,Oh. So it does. That's weird maybe I clicked on the wrong character by accident.
modernwarfare,fcsv1do,t3_eehk1u,1577925821.0,"Uninterrupted quad feed is a dumb challenge anyways. I hate things that are luck based because they depend on the enemies but even if you have perfect accuracy you can't force people to be clustered up all in one spot. This challenge has me salty because having it active means you can't to other challenges.

It wouldn't be a big deal if you didn't need to have it active and could let it come naturally."
CompetitiveForHonor,fcslb7l,t1_fcpa3id,1577918933.0,Too many dodge attacks and undodgeables nowadays making his kick to cabertoss useless and offensive stance in general much harder to use.
CompetitiveForHonor,fcp2vud,t3_ei5mzk,1577848799.0,And the low gb vuln means you have to hard feint and parry him instead but if he also is able to feint when you feint you have to make an additional read if you think he will feint making the gb safe to go for and risk taking 40 damage if he doesn't. And even if you do manage to parry him into an oos state it doesn't do anything anyways since rocksteady makes him immune to max punishes. I'd love to just see rocksteady removed.
CompetitiveForHonor,fcomevz,t3_eh3g4a,1577835891.0,"Input lag screws the console playerbase far more than frame rate does. Still though really good players can consistently parry 500ms attacks and most 400ms stuff is either chain prediction or block a certain direction when in neutral so console works at the highest level of play but mid and low level the game is just kinda garbage.

So yeah I think a competitive scene could work since by definition it should have the better players that can handle the disadvantages but the console version definitely needs work and while nothing can be done about the input delay having the 60fps would still be a nice help."
CompetitiveForHonor,fcok4kw,t1_fcnbzji,1577834247.0,Exercise increases reaction time and eating healthy too. I wasn't able to parry lights until I switched up my lifestyle after hearing there's a lot of mental benefits to living healthy in terms of cognitive efficiency. Bought a cheap treadmill that I do 15 minutes a day on and stick to 3 meals a day with no processed or fast food.
CompetitiveForHonor,fcojzbn,t1_fcnvtna,1577834141.0,I hear gb has a small gb vulnerability window in a sense but im situations where this happens I believe you can sitll cgb you just gotta be quick because it can happen at any time even if it isn't super common.
modernwarfare,fcfr5mh,t3_eh1ggq,1577632923.0,Dang. Noticed this g7n being horribly imaccurate the whole painful journey of levelling it and assumed it was the absurdly high idle sway screwing me but nope guess it sucks for artificial reasons as well.
modernwarfare,fcfprke,t1_fcc57mq,1577632581.0,Nah it aint. Battlefront 2 was also something like 110 gigs last I checked and I'd love to have both but will be deleting cod when the new updates come out because it looks fire and cod remains pretty bland and unchanged whereas if it was smaller I would have kept both. If you're gonna be big gigs then it can just as easily be incentive to not keep if the game is bad since you are painfully aware of the other games it holds you back from enjoying.
starwarsrebels,fcciz5w,t1_fc6426b,1577598936.0,"Hah, just googled frame rate drops in rebels and found this thread. That is the main issue I noticed as well that when the inquisitor is spinning his saber it gets choppy or something.
