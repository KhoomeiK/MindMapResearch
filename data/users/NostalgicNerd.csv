AskReddit,ff4od35,t1_ff451ub,1579568517.0,"Growing up, my mom would very often take me with her to mall as she was a bit of a fashionista. These frequent trips manifested into being common settings in my dreams. If I were to dream about school, the school is in a mall with classrooms being inside stores. If I were dreaming I forgot to wear pants that day—Oh hey, I’m running around Macy’s desperately trying to find a pair. These “dream malls” would have unique layouts but I would sometimes have reoccurring dreams in malls I’ve dreamt before. 

Now that I’m a young adult I don’t have these kinds of dreams as often. But when I do, I dream about the same reoccurring “dream mall,” a compact yet almost labyrinthian five-story mall. The lobbies are dark but are lit by the lights inside the stores. Since the mall is so large, there’s a large main section of  stores that in one area, has a beautiful natural waterfall pouring from the exposed roof to the bottom floor but following the corridors of stores will start to lead to more dingier stores and the mall begins to look like the walled city of Kowloon if it were a mall. 

Apologies for the ramble as I’ve never had the opportunity to share this and I haven’t put much thought into these dreams until I began more invested in writing this comment out."

I remember being super hyped for Su/Mo, had fun with it but had a “Is that it...?” disappointed feeling because it felt too linear and not the same feeling I expect from older pokemon games. I wasn’t hyped for SwSh at all but still bought it day one for my little brother—I haven’t touched it since, other than glances of my little bro play it. 

I guess I’m getting too old for the series (not knocking on those who still do!) since I enjoy traditional JRPGs like Dragon Quest more these days."
