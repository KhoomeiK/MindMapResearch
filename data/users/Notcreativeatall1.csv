NoahGetTheBoat,ffbod63,t3_esqa7r,1579775555.0,"A man is feeling down, so he goes and finds himself a prostitute as a bit of a pick me up. 

Prostitute says he can either get the $30 handjob, $50 blow job, or the $100 special. The guy, intrigued, asks what the special entails. The prostitute says that she will give him the $50 blowjob, but will also sing the national anthem at the same time, the only catch is, the lights have to be off during. The man can’t believe that is even possible, so he agrees. They go to a motel and do the deed. 

It was the best blowjob the man has ever had, and the national anthem was sang perfectly. He was shocked. So he went to her the next day and requested the special again. Same exact outcome. So he goes and tells his buddy about it, and they spent some time trying to puzzle out how that feat is even possible. Finally the buddy tells him to hire her again, and in the middle of it, he will jump out of the closet and flip the lights on. 

So, the guy goes and finds the prostitute again, asked for the special, and away the go. Half way through, his buddy runs out and turns the lights on. Prostitute screams, throws her glass eye back in and runs out the door."
