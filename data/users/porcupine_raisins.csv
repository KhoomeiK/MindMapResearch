I would say the not pooping outside is the real issue and she doesn’t know that outside is where that activity should be taking place. Maybe she is pooping in her sleep, but if she pooped before bed, that probably wouldn’t happen. Maybe kind of like a kid peeing the bed?"

She doesn’t chew my stuff anymore because she’s growing up and has learned better (also has plushies to chew if she really gets a hankering for cloth), but I think mostly it was me learning to pick up after my dang self and push in the chairs at the table, lest I want to lose half a shepherds pie.

From my experience (I’m a teacher who’s had my own class and subbed), most of us don’t plan super intensive classes (in elementary) when these days happen - at least the first day or two. Last year when it was cold for all of February, it would’ve been crazy not to teach new material because it would be impossible to catch up.

dogs,fek3pew,t3_epi99u,1579191952.0,I don’t understand why your parents got another dog/puppy when they know yours is not socialized... I just want to extend my condolences - I can’t imagine being in your position.
unpopularopinion,fejoj6w,t1_feiqf5v,1579181688.0,"I’m so sorry for your loss. My brother also developed weed-induced schizophrenia four years ago at age 20. We think he was probably smoking it since around 14. I agree that it’s also related to genetics and your likelihood to develop schizophrenia (or similar mental illnesses). Mental illness runs in my family, and he always had some issues, looking back. He didn’t get well until he completely stopped weed. It was a really scary time for all of us... of course he doesn’t remember the things he did. Sometimes I wish he could. 

He just got cut back on a bunch of his meds and now only receives a monthly shot, in addition to taking Ritalin to focus, which is awesome. After four years, he has finally got a job and seems super happy to “have a purpose” again. Unfortunately, one of his coworkers and he have become good friends.... and they smoke weed together at the friend’s place after closing. So I’m just waiting for the other shoe to drop. 

I was just talking to my mom this weekend on the phone (he lives with my parents), who told me he was smoking again. I just don’t understand why he would choose to do this when he 100% knows what it did to him. He says “he’s read up on it” and with his certain med he’s unlikely to experience psychosis. Like, sweet.

saskatoon,feaf4kc,t3_eo9sb7,1578947874.0,"I haven’t checked it out yet, but Furbaby Pet Care is $5 after daycare hours and weekends, with up to date vaccinations and whatnot. Sounds like they separate the large and small dogs. I think we’re going to try it out tonight since we haven’t been exercising much. Daycare twice a week just isn’t enough with this weather.

Edit: We went tonight and had a decent experience. The artificial turf takes some getting used to. Dogs can also go outside to a fenced yard, which is nice. No shame for peeing or pooping inside. There are bags, mops, and disinfecting spray. The turf has drainage, as well. There are lots of couches and other things to play on. I would recommend bringing a toy to play tug if your dog needs extra encouragement to play. Also, it is $5 per hour (I think the website just says $5, so this wasn’t clear). 

My pooch didn’t do a whole lot of running around, but just being there and being “on” has her tuckered out on the couch for the rest of the evening; I’d say it was a successful visit.

dogs,fea597m,t1_fea2zwq,1578944520.0,"Legit! Sounds like you have a similar situation. I have bird shit on my balcony ALL THE DAMN TIME, yet I don’t complain about the tree out front or demand someone else clean it. Many people who live here are also terrible for littering and throwing partially eaten food and bones on the ground. Can’t count the number of times I’ve had to fish something out of my dog’s mouth. It’s gross and scary. One time she had an entire chocolate brownie in her mouth! Another time, it was a hotdog WITH THE BUN! She should feel lucky, I guess, since that’s the only “people food” she gets haha. I’m not saying it’s the same people doing this as are complaining, but the litter is an actual danger and eyesore, unlike some yellow snow that gets covered in no time. 

The people I’ve had complain to me are Muslim, which I’ve learned from my students (I teach English as a second language) often doesn’t mesh with dogs as they may be viewed as being unclean. Many of my students have told me they aren’t allowed to touch a dog. I really respect this, so if someone seems uncertain around Callie, I pick her up so she doesn’t inadvertently touch them and it also keeps her less likely to bark. So I kinda wonder if that’s why it’s such a big deal to some of my neighbours... but again, choose any other building to live in if it’s a real concern."

dogs,fe9wuan,t1_fe9vg9v,1578942182.0,"I saw that it’s not off-leash after commenting - sorry! 

I honestly got lucky with my dog being good off-leash. I got her when she was 9 months and avoided going to the dog park for about three months out of fear she wouldn’t listen to me. I had another terrier with horrible recall growing up. She’s a Jack Russell, so has that hunting instinct, so maybe the colour of dog reminds her of a rabbit? I only notice she’s really bad about those specific dogs when she’s inside looking out the window, in the car, or on leash (confined). Otherwise, they’re just another dog to her. A real mystery. Actually, about a month ago, Callie got away from me on a walk in the morning when she surprised me by taking off after a rabbit. She chased it across the street and a bit further, but when I called her, told her I had a treat, and motioned like I was gonna leave her, she came running. Truly not what I was expecting. 

Your pup is still young, but they’re so nice to train and smart! She’ll be a great off-leash dog some day!"
dogs,fe9vhz6,t1_fe9kp52,1578941800.0,"OP said their dog does fine at daycare, which would be very similar to a dog park. My dog is the same way: totally fine off-leash, but reactive on.

dogs,fe9ua06,t1_fe93rn3,1578941489.0,"My dog sounds just like yours - leash-reactive and doesn’t like white/gray fluffs. She is also very good at daycare; actually is kind of a wuss and tends to stick around the sidelines of the action, rather than play. At the park, she’ll stick with me and play with other dogs, but she’s picky about who she plays with. She loves to run, but 99% of the time will come back when I call and also check in with me. This was a fluke and I think can be attributed to her being a one-person chicken dog. When I’m at my parent’s place and she gets let outside without confinement, her recall is a different story. What I learned from this is that dogs can surprise us with what they’ll do at the park. 

Callie will literally be a jerk all the way to the off-leash area if I’m not super on top of things (“look” and make her sit for a treat as the person or dog goes by), and sometimes will be when we get there before I take off her leash. I also find she will be okay on the way back to the car, as long as she’s good and tired and feels like she had enough of a play (I guess). I would love for her not to be so reactive, but sometimes people or dogs seemingly come out of nowhere and freak her out. When she’s loose, she’s like a different dog - I think the feeling of security knowing she can escape if need be. 

Is there a reason you walk your dog on a leash in an off-leash area? I assume it doesn’t stick with you? That might be something to work on to get your pup more socialized with you around. I know they can act like totally different dogs at daycare compared to when their parent is around lol. I have found that socializing more at the park off-leash has made the leash reactivity a lot better in predictable situations."
dogs,fe7xdkq,t1_fe764gb,1578920201.0,"Oh, I know all of this and I do see his point; maybe I didn’t make that clear. I just don’t agree with how extreme this has gotten. The place has now become dog minded only in that we are allowed to have dogs in our apartment suite and that there are garbage cans at a couple doors with doggy bags. When I moved in and signed/renewed my lease, none of this was an issue. Also, the grass, when it isn’t covered in several feet of snow, is ugly and dead anyway from people using their patio doors as their main entrances instead of the sidewalk and cutting the corners when walking to the bus stop and vehicles. I’d argue they are more responsible for the grass dying than dog pee, especially since I haven’t seen any randomized spots of dead grass. Thanks for the comment :)"

It wasn’t even this neighbour’s kid, but a totally different family! But conveniently just days after the first incident. I’m 99% sure they’re in cahoots. 

This weather is such a bummer. I hear it’s here for about a month, much like last year’s lovely February. I’m sure your dog isn’t a huge fan of going on the deck, either, but a dog’s gotta do what a dog’s gotta do, I guess."

My childhood dog has been gone for four years and I still get emotional thinking about him. I often think about how he and my current dog would get along so well, and how his spirit seems to find my current dog when I go back home. She only runs away from me when I go home, and he was notorious for his escaping skills lol. Being around other dogs helped me, as well as talking about him. I also just thought about how great he made life and I often thank him for the brightness and loyalty he gave. He lived a long life and was suffering, so it helps to know he isn’t in pain anymore."
