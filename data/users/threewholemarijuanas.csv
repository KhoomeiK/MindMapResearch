I would love to see wheelchairs added to the game, but I think the reality of how difficult life is as a wheelchair user would make it complicated to code for."

Edited to add: and yes, I do have both in the fridge at all times. Butter is serious business. 

If you haven’t made a Kerrygold grilled cheese, do so ASAP."

If you’ve got an extra 50-100 bucks lying around, you could do one of those DNA tests! You can do them through the Vet or get them online. I’m going to do them with my rescue pups because I’m so curious as to how they could be so stinking cute."

She wants to make sure she knows if you get up, so she can go on the next adventure right alongside you."

OopsDidntMeanTo,ff5jm73,t1_ff5i5fx,1579595965.0,"I didn’t call her tone deaf, that was someone else. She has a minimal grasp on pitch. But she’s not great stylistically, varies from flat to sharp, and ultimately needs a lot more depth to her voice, shift it down from being so nasal. The run on “night” was clunky and awkward. Cringey to listen to ill-practiced runs. 

Singing along to a backing track without an in-ear can indeed make it hard to find your pitch, but she doesn’t even sound like she’s had any vocal training. Not tone deaf, but definitely not a good tone.

Edited to add: I’m a firm believer in “there’s no *bad* singers, just ones who need more practice. She would benefit from lots of practice and a good vocal coach."

It works better than any pain killer or pill I’ve tried, but I have no way to get it. My state is so corrupt we’ll be the last to legalize."
nextfuckinglevel,fey0zav,t1_fexuulk,1579439339.0,Only in some places! My city isn’t wheelchair friendly in the slightest.
ChronicPain,fetqg9q,t1_fet5kvz,1579378390.0,"Yep. Have been doing great on Tramadol for years. Never once ran out of pills before my next script became due, never once had any problem with them. 

Now, my doctor doesn’t want to prescribe them. I’ve been cut down to a third of what I once took. 

Since this cut, I now can no longer go to the gym, laundry is a lot harder to do so it piles up, my hands constantly hurt, so my crafty hobbies are painful to do now. I has no problem on Tramadol, but because I “don’t need it” my quality of life is now suffering."
cursedimages,fes0ptp,t1_fepfy28,1579360217.0,Birmingham is the least rural part of the state. The stereotypes comes from the rural areas. Birmingham is actually a nice up and coming city.

I’m the fattest I’ve ever been in my life, and just this year found someone who loves me for me, loves my body, loves the whole package! There’s wonderful people out there, it just takes a lot of searching to find them. I’ve been single for 3 years and almost gave up trying to find anyone. If I had, I wouldn’t have met the amazing person in my life now!"
