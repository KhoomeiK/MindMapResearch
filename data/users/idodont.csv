booksuggestions,fctujd7,t3_eiqx82,1577960244.0,"If you like fantasy try -
1. Mistborn
2. Cruel prince ( slow initially )
3. The night circus
4. Mystic and the rider
5. Urban fantasy series - Kate Daniels (not for everyone)
6. Way of the kings
7. Howl's moving castle Graceling

These are in no specific order but all of them are different kind of fantasy novels. Once you get a book you like in these 7 you can easily get similar such novels."
52book,fctuaoy,t1_fcteelo,1577959888.0,"I just loved this book a lot and wanted to tell someone about it. It has a great storyline. Very strong characters and the way the author describes the magic, the feelings and the circus are so alluring. It has that hot chocolate with marshmallows feel to it. The best part about this book is every character has a strong personality. No character is introduced just to support another or get the story going. It takes a while to get you hooked on but it's great once you are into it. Enjoy the read. Happy New year!

Wishing you and OP a lot of marshmallows!"
