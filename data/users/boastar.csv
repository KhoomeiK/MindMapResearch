GrandMountainAdv,ffgpftc,t1_ffgon2d,1579911727.0,"That part yes. The parts that I mentioned not so much in my opinion. One is just realistic skiing. And the controls. They have a certain purpose. They try to simulate skiing a bit. If you changed them to simple button presses it would change the game completely. I just don’t seem to have the problems you describe. For example, swiping down to stop always works. And i miss a rail maybe 1-2 times in 10 tries. All in all feedback like yours is good yes. I just thought it was a bit too much, as the game works pretty flawless for me. I’ve been playing it different though I think. Didn’t try to see everything fast, but instead concentrated on perfecting controls, all the jumping tricks etc, and progressing slower."
GrandMountainAdv,ffg4msp,t3_et29an,1579898359.0,"Hm, so you want them to basically reprogram half the game to better fit your needs? Some of the things you mention about the controls get better with practice and precise timing. As for the „hitting the gate“ thing: did you ever ski in such an environment? The gates with two poles and a flag slow you down considerably, and you also miss the whole gate if one ski is on the wrong side of the inner pole. So that’s just the game being realistic, even if it bothers you."

aww,ff8eax2,t1_ff8d6pv,1579674852.0,"I always wonder why that happens? Almost any time I see a dog related post on the frontage of r/all it is a pitbull. And it happens a lot, like 2-3 times a week. Ist that an American thing? Or is it some sort of campaign? In Europe pitbulls are absolutely detested, for how violent they still can be (and yes I know it isn’t really their fault, but it’s still a fact the race was bread to be violent, at least in europe). So what’s up with all those cutie pitbull posts? Are they just seen differently in the US?

To add: in some parts of germany, and also in other european countries, pitbull terriers are basically outlawed dogs, meaning normal people can’t hold them, and no one is allowed to breed them."
videos,ff3cue4,t1_ff30lo9,1579538610.0,"In the context here „the real shit“ meant the good stuff. „Literal shit“ meant it tastes like the shit that is coming out of ones behind. It’s not easy though because something can also have ie „a real shit taste“ which means it tastes bad. I’m not a native speaker either, and it took me a while to get all the subtleties of the english language down."
nfl,ff1n9mf,t3_er41w0,1579482006.0,What a heavenly first half!
nfl,ff16muc,t3_er422y,1579475743.0,Not only did the Chiefs get a lot of close and meaningful calls go their way. But most importantly their oline held almost every play in the 2nd half and it was never called. Unfortunately that ruined what could have been a great game.
nfl,ff0ved9,t1_ff0v6yo,1579472665.0,It was just too obvious. They could have probably thrown 10-15 flags in that drive.
nfl,ff0v080,t3_er1075,1579472530.0,I think I’ve never seen so many uncalled holds in a row on one drive. Some plays the Chiefs committed 2 or even 3 holds.
nfl,ff0tzwc,t3_er1075,1579472292.0,Chiefs commit a hold on every play this drive. None called.
nfl,ff0rk1f,t3_er1075,1579471647.0,Nice acting by the chiefs there.
Mavericks,fetypm4,t1_felikvd,1579381391.0,"No I don’t think so. It is pretty unlikely that anything is going on at all anyways. But if the NBA does indeed manipulate the results then it would be 100% about LeBron. If LeBron was hurt the NBA doesn’t care if it’s Harden, Kawhi, Luka or AD. Anyone of those guys means a financial loss compared to LeBron being captain. So this is not at all about keeping Luka out of the captain spot, it is all about keeping LeBron in."
Mavericks,fel763u,t3_epnz0q,1579215519.0,"I am not saying it is a conspiracy but it is at least noteworthy I think. I looked into the voting the Last 4 years. LeBron always gets just the 100000-300000 votes more he needs to place first.

-	When Giannis had 1,6 mio LeBron got 1,8.
-	Next year Giannis jumped to 2,53 mio. But sure thing LeBron had just enough at 2,63.
-	Then Luka got an incredible 4,2 mio. But of course LeBron was even more incredible at 4,6 mio.
-	And this year Luka has reached these same 4,6 mio 4 days before the end of voting. But, OF COURSE, LeBron is even better at 4,74.

So 4 years in a row LeBron will have just enough votes to be captain. I wonder what would happen if China adopted Luka and pushed him to 10 mio next year. The incentive is really big for the NBA to have LeBron as captain. On the other hand it is pretty obvious that Lakers fans are going crazy, given where some of their trash players stand."

aww,febsn36,t1_febo20j,1578962234.0,"Im trying to explain it to you very simple. Dogs were once wolves. Dogs still posses a lot of the dna, instincts and traits of wolves. A deeply rooted instinct in dogs is: when a dog feels cornered it will fight or flight. This dog is cornered, and since it sits in a bag has no chance at fleeing (probably the biggest reason for his stress). So if the situation becomes too stressful the dog will fight, eg bite one of the kids. These are the situations where clueless people like you later say „I don’t know what went into my dog. He’s so well behaved. And he had so much fun. It came out of the blue“, when in reality it was easy as day to see what’s happening. There are tons of videos where the started to show his teeth, starts to ruffle the nose, and people still continue to „pet“. And: I didn’t say not to pet, I said they should pet one at a time. That would be a much better way to introduce the dog to these kids. 

YOU are the one who is treating the dog like a person by saying it’s intelligent, it will get used to it. That is not how dogs function though. You can make a dog tolerate such a situation but he will always show his stress level. And there is allways a chance he might snap. Even a dog that has been a „good boy“ for 10 years."
aww,feb5ekv,t1_feb0lnn,1578955599.0,"Why not? The girls seem to be careful and polite. If the owner just asked them to pet one at a time I’m sure the would understand. Also, the corgi is in a bag, so the owner could always just walk away (not the best solution though, just talking to the girls instead of taking a video of the whole thing would be best)."
aww,feaztle,t1_feav5af,1578953979.0,"Uh, I’m talking about the owner obviously, not the girls. I put zero blame on the girls here, they are happy and genuine. But the owner shouldn’t put his dog under this much stress."
aww,fea77qx,t3_eo6njp,1578945163.0,"Why can people not learn to read their dogs? This dog is very uncomfortable. The eyes, ears, mlem all say the exact same thing. He’d very much prefer for it to stop and get some space and quiet! „But it’s so cute!“ No it’s not, if you have a dog please educate yourself about the species.

Edit: edited out a curse word. I just get very upset when I see these kind of videos here. They are living beings who trust us 100%. Show some respect."
AppleMusic,fe9ktsv,t3_crt7rl,1578938764.0,"Is there any solution to the split album problem on Apple Music?? It is so ridiculous. Some longer albums are split into three to four parts in my library, with some parts being only 1-2 songs. And I have it everywhere in the library now. Like a virus that spreads. It is really really embarrassing for Apple and made me try others finally even though I’m fully Apple integrated. Registered for Tidal today."

nfl,fdyzsz5,t1_fdyz00w,1578785282.0,I‘m not debating that here. It seems though as if NBC won’t show Bosas cheap shot even once more. While Clowneys was shown over and over and over and a campaign against him was startet instantly on Twitter. Seems pretty hypocritical.
nfl,fdyy39j,t3_end9mc,1578784715.0,"For sure there will be a campaign against Bosa now right? Just like Clowney.

And NBC will show the play another 20 times right?"

PinballFX3,fdq123z,t1_fdndrx5,1578649578.0,"I have unlocked all tables without paying. I paid to get the physics and fx for all tables feature. For the rest I grinded. Right now I have 5 tables where I’m missing the 4th star, but I will get there. The f2p model is actually ok now. It can’t be too cheap or easy, then no one would be paying. My big complaint though is that their „special“ sales for money only give you half the table (for the highest prices on any platform), meaning 2 stars. That is completely rediculous, as you then have to pay a fuckton to get them to 4 stars (which is actually nothing special or extra, it’s just a complete table with all features), or you have to grind a long time. This structure is the reason this app will see absolutely no money at all from me, even though I like the app a lot."
nba,fdgas5k,t1_fdfsqn5,1578387596.0,After watching the game just now I think your team has lots of potential. I’ve seen you play 3 times now this season and always felt that you are an incredibly bad coached team. Also why the frick wouldn’t you use Markkanen more?

nfl,fdc2l7z,t1_fdc28rw,1578265858.0,"Come on now don’t be so partisan. It was rtp clear as day. Russel stood there for a couple seconds, the tackler took at least 3 steps. He tried to play it down after contact. Overall the Seahawks got called against more than twice as much.

Im not even rooting for one of the teams. I’m not one of the „hate the Eagles“ cowboy fans."
nfl,fdc1cs4,t1_fdbzho3,1578265196.0,"Like I said unfortunate and unnecessary. But he was a runner, so I don’t think what Clowney did was illegal. Or at least it wasn’t clear cut. If it had been against Dak I’d probably think about it differently, everybody is a bit biased, so I understand Eagles fans frustration."
nfl,fdbyj12,t1_fdby4pv,1578263881.0,"No like the bullshit Opi, the missed offside, the missed catch. Clowney led with the shoulder, Wentz was a runner. An unfortunate play but not illegal.
