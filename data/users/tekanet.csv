sonos,ffc4c3n,t1_ffc1gyu,1579791210.0,"You're placing a device where hardware and software are made by the same company, using external APIs (which are software contracts, not implementations) to connect to services at the same level of smartphones which are manufactured by a company, running an OS made by another and using apps made by a multitude of other companies. 

Sonos has everything it needs to decide the fate of its products in its hands. Adapting for API changes is usually no big deal, especially when an API is published by a large company which usually don't break backward compatibility.

The other thing that's very different is that that Windows Phone didn't stopped the updates on a Windows laptop in the same network. You can continue upgrading the laptop and connect the phone to it. 

So I'm ok if some features are not added or updated on older devices. But don't force me to choose between keeping everything in legacy mode or trash some of my devices."

sonos,ffbn8p8,t1_ffbh6xf,1579773855.0,"I'm 99% this will not work. 

Say you have one legacy product: from my understanding, to work grouped together (as in ""playing the same source at the same time"") with your newer products they must have the same software version. The software version will be dictated by your legacy component. So, and this is one of the worst things about this whole mess, your new speaker can't install upgrades if you wish to group with older ones. 

At some stage (this is natural and to be clear doesn't require any more computational power than what we have now) Spotify will change something in its API. Sonos will implement this change in their software and distribute the update. But your speakers can't install the update, because otherwise they'll break backward compatibility. So, from that moment your entire system will be cut out from Spotify. 

They'll eventually provide some sort of segregation system; but from that moment on, you either play Spotify only on your newer speakers or play grouped. Not both.

(also /u/imol who said he's interested)

EDIT: oh, and my suggestion in your case is to expand with that one more One if you want (if everyone here is really going to do what they say they want to do, eBay will be flooded with second hand Play:1) but stop there."

sonos,ffbl4z5,t1_ffaxlr9,1579770628.0,"> All good, but why should Sonos keep updating your speakers for free for a hundred years, like you mentioned?

Because by keeping me happy with that I a) expand my system and b) encourage others to adopt that product. These are expensive speakers, I'm sure there are people who can buy them all at once but from my understanding a lot of us built up their system along the years."
sonos,ffbkxjk,t1_ff9x4q9,1579770306.0,"I wonder why. Maybe they think they can gain more from new customers looking for features that old components are keeping back? I mean, I can lose 100 customers if I gain 1000 new ones. 

If that's the case, but I'm not a marketing person, they seem to ignore the fact that the 100 customers they're going to lose will have a huge impact on new potential customers by discouraging them at all costs. After all, the most hardcore of us are those who believed and feel more betrayed; moreover, they're the ones that were at the beginning of the adoption curve, that have the power and connection to spread the word to encourage others to buy something and surely have an even stronger power to discourage our family and friends, the people who look at us for an advice. 

It is as simple as ""Sure, you can buy a Sonos, sounds great, very easy to setup. But keep in mind that you're buying a 500€ speaker that could stop working after 5 years like my old one, so you're basically paying it 100€ per year""."

One knows beforehand that a non replaceable battery is going to render useless a device. Your iPhone 6 didn't stop working and even if Apple stop updating it, it doesn't prevent your MacBook and iPad to be up-to-date. And they continue to work together.

I understand that things are moving faster. Thing is, they're a tech company that operates in a market where things work in a different, slower way (if we can agree that they sell speakers). 

And if you enter a market and disrupt that market, you have to add things without removing what was there before you. A ""dumb"" speaker stops working when it's broken, same goes with an ampli. You MUST take this into account. And I'm pretty sure that the requirements for playing Spotify aren't going to increase in the future. New services can't be implemented? That's ok to me, I understand. Not adding something new is different from removing something that works."
sonos,ff8xoa9,t1_ff8mhbz,1579699437.0,"You're comparing cheap products to a 500€ speakers: they're not in the same league. And sorry, but software is not something that magically evolves on his own: they control both hardware and software, so they decide to create new software that has larger requirements in terms of hardware. It is deliberate.

As it is deliberate not to think of a different strategy: a couple of clever ideas I've read are a new component that can master those old speakers or a differentiation of the firmware in two branches, one with newest capabilities and one with long term support.

You don't seem to understand that most of us long-term Sonos users like to be milked. Sonos is a system you don't usually buy all at once, you gradually expand it. And I was well ok with that, up until the latest announcements: because now my entire setup is rendered obsolete if I can't upgrade any firmware and because now I know that the destiny of all my speakers is doomed. 

All of this because what? Because they want to add more powerful voice assistance? Or should we expect some AI gibberish? You made it clear, we stuck with Sonos because of their flawless wireless multiroom capabilities in playing music. That's all. I don't give a fuck about all the accessory features, I need them to play music. If they need to add stuff to keep up with the market or attract new customers, that's ok, I just don't use Alexa or whatever. 

I don't expect lifetime support, I expect a more sensible way to manage a fade-out while keeping your (up until now) loyal customers happy. Also, they made the terrible mistake of flagging products obsolete without showing anything that actually renders them obsolete: I'm the first to ditch old stuff when needed; new games require new hardware, I actually can see this requirement because a game runs slower and I switch to a newer console or graphics card or whatever. New laws require my car to pollute less, otherwise I can't enter city centers. Can you tell me what is the feature that pushes me to abandon a fully functional Play:5? Can Sonos? If they can, they messed up with the timings. If they can't, it's poor development. 

Or maybe they want to run Slack on our speakers, that would explain a lot."
