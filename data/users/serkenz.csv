weddingshaming,ffa818k,t3_esfb1c,1579729684.0,"So I had a small ceremony and dinner with just immediate family and friends (30) which was early and then we had a reception immediately afterwards where the rest of our friends came (another 50 odd) it was the best!! We had the intimacy of the ceremony and dinner and speeches that we wanted and we got the party and the dancing with our friends that we wanted.

A lot of our guests loved it because instead of having their entire day be about the wedding they just got to show up at 7 for an awesome party which is what I always look forward to at a wedding for someone I’m not very very close to. We also had an open bar and said no gifts which I think helped people appreciate it. 

I also know lots of people who have been doing similar things lately.

The only thing I would keep in mind is that people likely won’t want to sit through a bunch of speeches if they aren’t also getting dinner. I’d structure it more like a cocktail party with dancing"

One of my biggest vices in life is that if I have a cocktail I like to have a cigarette. I’m not a huge drinker but enough that I was smoking a few evenings a month and I hated it.

Yesterday (day 10) was the hardest day so far. I just couldn’t be satisfied with the food I had prepared. Last night I had nightmares all night that I was drinking and smoking! I woke up feeling terrible this morning until I realized it didn’t happen.

So maybe we dream about what we feel the most guilty about?!"

AskReddit,fdsq5er,t1_fdsa1xn,1578706500.0,"I’m a smaller woman, only 5’1, and for some reason whenever I’m in a long line the person behind me feels the need to give me about 2 inches of personal space. I have certain ways of dealing with it but mostly I let it go even though it can be intimidating when 90% of the world is bigger than I am.

A few months ago I was waiting to check in at the airport in Tokyo and the line was bonkers. I’m still like 200 people back and this woman behind me seemed to think that the closer she was to me the faster the line would move. After discretely trying to shuffle away from her but having her edge closer each time I decided enough was enough.
I waited for the next time the line moved - usually 2-3 steps at once. I moved up but I twisted my torso to the right like I was looking at something down the terminal. As expected this woman moves up and she’s closer to me than my husband is. That’s what I enact my revenge. Without moving my feet or backing up at all I turn my torso back to the center and my large 25L travel backpack knocks her from shoulder to hip. She gasps and falls back, clutching her pearls.

I just gave her an annoyed look for being in my backpack space and carried on waiting."
whole30,fdrsn0t,t1_fdrke9p,1578689077.0,Try using the leaves from the romaine heart and use them like a taco shell almost. For some reason hand food satisfies my crunch craving more than another salad does!
whole30,fdrdzgv,t1_fdrbryp,1578683086.0,"Celery! Make some delicious dip or almond butter. It totally works for me.

Also I made lettuce boats of our romaine yesterday to shovel tuna salad into my mouth and the crunch was super satisfying"
IDOWORKHERELADY,fdqksoq,t3_elyxil,1578669062.0,"Many years ago when we were young and fun my husband woke up with a brutal hangover. We had a great take out pizza spot down the road from us so he threw on some shorts, an old hockey jersey, and a toque to go get us food. He had ordered the pizza and was waiting in the parking lot hoping that the fresh air would make him feel better. As he stood there slowly turning green a young boy and his mom walked by going to the shop next door. The boy turned to his mom and asked ‘why is that man so sad?’ And the mom, turning to look at my husband holding his face in his hands, said to her son ‘well it’s because some people don’t have a home’"

New Years resolution is to read more!

As far as fantasy recommendations go - I’m sure you’ve read the Locke lamora series which I really liked as well as the king killer chronicles. I’m actually reading the His Dark Materials trilogy right now which is YA but I never picked up as a kid. The first book was amazing, the second was so-so and I’m hoping the 3rd pulls it all together. If you haven’t read Kings of the Wyld and it’s sequel Bloody Rose they should be top of your list for sure. And absolutely anything by Guy Gavriel Kay with my personal favourite being Lions of Al-Rassan or the Sarantine Mosaic or the Fionavar Tapestry or or or ... haha man I could keep going for a while"
