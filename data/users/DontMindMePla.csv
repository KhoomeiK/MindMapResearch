todayilearned,fcbibbb,t1_fcb13zj,1577587211.0,"Hey, thanks for the insight. Puts things into perspective. Sometimes people take things too seriously here and some put sources as evidence to their claims, which is a one up compared to facebook. I guess it allowed my subconscious to believe that people posting sources are more knowledgeable, even if it may be from wikipedia, hence my question. Thank you for the well put answer!"
todayilearned,fcbfmph,t1_fcb8gro,1577586270.0,yup i do see the sources below. the page. It's the paraphrasing or the summary of said articles that is the one taught to us to be wary about. I agree though that it can be a good start to researching.
todayilearned,fcazcgc,t1_fcaways,1577579599.0,"I'm curious, has Wikipedia always been cited this much on reddit? I haven't signed up to reddit since after college (not even a year ago) and all my life I've tried not to rely on wikipedia and actually search the specific articles on my own to make up the summary for myself. It's how I've been taught to act using the internet. Did sonething change about wikipedia or has it been cited this much since before? 

not a diss in wikipedia. please be kind to me"

CrackWatch,fc2a46a,t1_fc1bp3h,1577348021.0,"you know, I actually did check steam and the negative reviews are still because people have tehnical issues with the game, even in the latter half of december, suggesting that the game is still in need of big patches and optimizations. ""no more annoying bugs"" would be believable if the reviews it has right now werent mostly negative and said negative reviews talk about technical rather than subjective reasons. 

My argument stands amid yours. Its possible they dont want or cant crack it yet now, its also possible that theyve decided that they *dont* want to crack it because of the reasons i stated above(hassle to update, game still unplayable or has gamebreaking bugs still that its not worth it to crack it now)."

CrackWatch,fbzk4tc,t1_fbyrllw,1577249406.0,"I put my mind at ease early on by looking at it this way: Cracking it early would probably not be a good use of their time since it would be buggy as hell and a bitch to play on. Esp if most people pirating it would be those without the high end rig(im badly generalizing that most with high end rig that could healthily play the game would probs be the ones being the early adopters of the game anyway.), meaning they cant actually play ot well ON TOP of the buggy mess that it is. Probably, they decided to take it slow and wait a bit for updates so when they do release a cracked version it'll be with less issues on the game itself on top of the people who arent able to make it work bc of insrall issues."

Thank you very much though for suggesting :)"
