Atlanta,ffii7kf,t1_ffi34l1,1579974471.0,"We had 3 of these kind of units replaced a couple years ago on our 3-floor building, so we used a crane. It was kind of unreal seeing these 10-ton units carefully being carried over people and cars to be placed on the roof."
AskReddit,fcuyh4p,t3_eixc75,1577991047.0,"Met a woman on Bumble. She was from Brazil, been in the country 2 weeks (I'm in the US). We spoke for a week and then met for our first date. Pretty room, stereotypically curvy. 

I should add that I did not speak Portuguese, she did not speak English. We used translators the entire time of this date.

Went to a steakhouse, then to Piedmont Park in Atlanta to walk at night, almost got arrested by police because she climbed on top of me as we sat on a bench and they were waiting in the darkness. I tried to explain to her that they wanted to see our IDs and one of the cops was just like ""the hell with it, get out of here over by that exit.""

She recommended we go to her friend's place not too far away. Went there, they had a gathering going on, we went up to the master bedroom, the hosts made us a plate of food and set it beside the bedroom door.

Had a wild night. It was amusing for us to roll over to grab our phones to translate flirting and desires and general whatnots.

Woke up together, more sex, then she sat me down at the dining table and made me breakfast. Then we went our separate ways.

That was a good, interesting one."
GetMotivated,fcoudrc,t1_fcogt6w,1577841813.0,"Every single person I once considered a friend, including my two roommates, all of them are at a NYE party right now that I never knew about, was told about, was invited to. I've basically been shoved as a back burner and ostracized.

At first I was hurt and burned, but I re-framed it. Why am I trying so hard to be friends with these people who don't even consider me or want my company? So, I turned the negative thinking into a positive.

Going to involve myself in activities that interest me to meet people with similar desires, seeking fellow ambitious people, involving myself in circles and experiences that I adhere to.

Fuck the people that weigh you to the bottom of the ocean, cut them free and rise."
AdviceAnimals,fau8i3x,t1_fat581p,1576345627.0,"The W Midtown in Atlanta only does valet parking, it's $40/night.

There is a parking garage right next to it, but if you're going to be there a while, I believe it is still somewhere between $30-40 for overnight parking."
