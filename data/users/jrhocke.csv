funny,ff8wshm,t1_ff8tr6a,1579698655.0,"UPS driver. Whenever I deliver super big and heavy stuff I always try to get it as close to the door as feasibly possible if nobody is home. If I have trouble moving it, then the customer is sure as hell gonna have trouble. And I would feel bad if I put someone through that."
CFB,feddx57,t1_fecpwk0,1579008811.0,No no. Do it anyway.
CFB,feddurv,t1_fecra33,1579008754.0,Hello fellow NSU fan!
nfl,fdjxmzu,t3_elmemp,1578490731.0,Man this is a great post. You should 100% make these a weekly thing haha.
todayilearned,fd9x2fn,t1_fd80kpw,1578239019.0,This is already a thing. A pre-school.
TellMeAFact,fd7lpnv,t1_fd7ldn7,1578206420.0,"I think you could easy say that any of them from 4-7 was very crucial plot wise:


4 had the return of Voldemort

5 had the PUBLIC return

6 had the death of AD as well as the revelations of the deathly hallows

7 was the conclusion of the entire plot so obviously it’s important"
aww,fcxv9lk,t1_fcxv8b6,1578070954.0,Hell yeah! Cheers from Iraq!
aww,fcxoqiz,t1_fcxodx5,1578067937.0,Had a buddy that swore he was gonna get “I don’t know that your dog doesn’t bite” tattooed on his arm.
aww,fcxn1ve,t1_fcxmvjl,1578066848.0,I’ve never thought of squeaky shocks as the issue tbh although it makes more sense than my theory of the hollowness of the back of the truck making a unique noise that only dogs can hear.
videos,fcxmr9o,t1_fcwewce,1578066657.0,Or parked closer
videos,fcxmi02,t1_fcwznol,1578066488.0,"Current UPS driver here. Yeah this shit is inexcusable. If nothing else the dude should have parked way closer if he knew he had a big ass box for that house. When I was in training at my center, the motto was take as few steps as possible at every stop. Less opportunity for things to happen. Less possibility of getting hurt, messing up people packages, and you won’t tire as quickly."
aww,fcxjqgv,t1_fcxgupu,1578064629.0,UPS guy here. Dogs hear us from a VERY long distance.
Whatcouldgowrong,fcwjqya,t1_fcv78kj,1578027509.0,I didn’t even know that winter tires were a thing until I got on reddit.
AskReddit,fcv9zi0,t1_fcv012m,1577997735.0,"I work outside in Louisiana. During the summertime, I drink about half a case of water a day. The inside of my truck gets as high as 150 degrees plus that humidity. It’s rough."
GreenBayPackers,fcuslm4,t1_fcuscqh,1577987691.0,You. I like you.
GreenBayPackers,fcus0o5,t1_fcuqpei,1577987328.0,A couple?
UPS,fcunbok,t3_eivyr3,1577984664.0,Looks like it was meant to be sent to Germany but accidentally got mixed in with stuff going somewhere else. So they sent it back to the first huh and then sent it to the correct place.
FiftyFifty,fcumisk,t1_fctpxv7,1577984202.0,"Ya know, I went and did a bit of digging after seeing this because I had never heard of him. He lived a quite tragic life. But at least in his final years he was mostly comfortable and happy. Seemingly anyway. He lived in a hospital for several years thanks to generous donations from many of England’s upper class. Even got a visit from the Prince and Princess at one point. And after they met, every year she sent him a Christmas card. Interesting person."
AskReddit,fcfo1x1,t1_fcdyw0r,1577632121.0,Bruh. Read both the original and the update and the entire time I was thinking to myself “where the hell do these people live??? That would never happen where I live. The police would for sure do something etc.” Then I see the update on the original post and they’re from Louisiana which is where I live! Crazy!
