IAmA,ff6bmod,t1_ff36ffu,1579623644.0,"My son did OIT but had to stop because his stomach couldn't handle it.  Very frustrating since we were sailing along in updoses  (stepping the amount of peanut up every 2 weeks) and as the doctors mention, the success rate in their practice is high.  But a few things to remember when doing OIT:

1) Every day you are dosing your child has to be calm for a period of time after the dose is given.  No strenuous activity during the two hour window after the dose. 
2) You as a parent have to be strong mentally since every random sneeze or itch after that dose you need to think to yourself, is that a reaction?!  Note that with my son is that the reaction wasn't always in the 2 hour window but might occur after 3 hours or even the next morning.  
3) There are studies coming out that this kind of treatment could make the next reaction more severe (I will defer to the doctors on this comment).

And yes, it is difficult to manage.  I can truly sympathize with you!"
