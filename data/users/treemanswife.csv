CrossStitch,fead9o0,t3_enzrdd,1578947207.0,"You're not doing anything 'wrong', you're just a beginner and it takes time to get tidier.  

Two things cause messy backs: knots/loops forming that you don't catch and end up up getting stitched over.  You'll have to get in the habit of checking the back either with your fingertips or by flipping the piece over once in a while.  Also you eventually develop a sense of how long your thread is and it will feel 'short' if a knot forms.  The second cause of messiness is long jumps between crosses.  Again, over time your brain will start to think strategically about where to make your jumps to keep them short.  Sometimes you can place them strategically so they will be buried by another color.

Depending on the type of hoard, they may be able to sell enough of the stuff to pay their fee - even if there's nothing particularly valuable, if furniture and such is in saleable condition they can do it.

Of course, if your father suffers from both hoarding and squalor, they may not be able to salvage anything, in which case it would cost money.  But you shouldn't be on the hook for that legally."

With Thread Magic I did notice more benefit and no residue, but I decided that since the long-term effects were unknown it wasn't worth it.  I gave it to my daughter who isn't making heirloom quality stuff yet (she's 6).

Second, how about cleaning with your boyfriend?  You can have a positive dialogue going while you clean, and since he's right there you don't have to worry that he will come home and flip.

Third, how about a 'chore chart'?  Not in a little kid way, but in a 'these are the things I'm going to clean on X day' way.

My story is similar, though not so extreme.  My mom was always messy, but after she divorced my dad and became a single working mom, she also stopped cleaning.  Or, I should say, stopped clearing.  She would move stuff, clean under it, and move the stuff back.  We ate dinner every night by moving stuff off the table onto the couch, ate like normal people, and then put the stuff back.
