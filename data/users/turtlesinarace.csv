NoStupidQuestions,fc0l870,t3_efiua0,1577293563.0,It’s a weird meme in real life too because people think that depression is just like being sad. Which obviously is not the case.
offmychest,fbxkdtq,t3_ef0dva,1577191570.0,"There are still so many people who don’t understand depression and think it is just like being sad. 

I’m sorry you don’t have the support of your mom, especially around Christmas.

Just know you aren’t alone and you shouldn’t be ashamed. You will not ruin anything."
offmychest,fbxk6ei,t3_ef0iuh,1577191322.0,"First off, Happy Birthday!

I’m sorry you’re going through this. I struggle with major depression and anxiety and have dealt with some of the issues you have, ESPECIALLY the rejecting help part. I’m lucky enough to have met my boyfriend who helps me through it and helps even when I am an asshole to him and tell him not to help me. 

Mental illness is so real and not a lot of people realize it. There is nothing wrong with you, but medicine from a psychiatrist can help. It may take some experiments to find the right one but eventually you’ll be on the right track. 

I had the same issue with not being able to trust people. My insurance covers this app called Teladoc. You can talk to a therapist over the phone (makes it so much easier to talk and say personal things). You can also video chat a psychiatrist and they can help you try different medicines. 

You are not a waste of space and suicide is not the answer. Don’t be ashamed for having these thoughts but do recognize that something needs to be done about it. I would love to talk more or help, feel free to reach out because I feel like our experiences are pretty similar."
offmychest,fbxjn86,t3_ef0nng,1577190654.0,"I don’t think that is socially awkward at all. In fact that is so normal my friends do it all the time, especially while drinking. 

Try to relax, whoever is giving you shit is being an asshole."
offmychest,fbxjjvn,t3_ef0nq0,1577190537.0,"I really think it is a coincidence, not an HIV. 

Or it could have been all the drinking, 

The one time I blacked out from drinking I had the same symptoms as you and it lasted for weeks, turns out I had mono. That can be gotten through kissing but you just have to let it play it’s course and then you never have to worry about it again. It’s very common and some people have it a lot worse than others but it eventually goes away! 

Also, it took me 2 visits to the doctor for them to finally realize it was mono. That is why I hate doctors. If you don’t feel better soon go again and ask about mono and they can test specifically for that and maybe can help it go away faster. 

Either way, good luck. I doubt it is an HIV!"
weed,fbc7ors,t3_eclm0x,1576717648.0,"Definitely take it afterwards. You will be plenty enough drugged up during. I had my wisdom teeth out and procedure was fine it was afterwards or day after. 

My advice? Crush it up so you can eat if right after or the day after. Maybe even make a smoothie, it would taste awful but be worth it."
