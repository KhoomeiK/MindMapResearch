Anxiety,fdj4x5b,t1_fdj29a0,1578458545.0,I understand but it’s not real it’s just ridiculous memes.
Anxiety,fdiz0nl,t1_fdirgs3,1578454314.0,Exactly this isn’t an issue at all it’s just a bunch of “edgy” people making memes how that is “news” is beyond me it’s not news or a real concern it’s BS
Anxiety,fdiytaj,t3_ellziw,1578454172.0,This isn’t news it’s a bunch of “edgy” people making memes don’t worry yourself over this over nothing.  Anyone pushing this is either trying to be “edgy” or a fear monger don’t listen it’s not real
depression,fdiqe6v,t3_ellb6u,1578448698.0,Yep better little steps than nothing good job
Anxiety,fdiml82,t3_elgpe2,1578446268.0,Good song too
depression,fdiexbv,t3_elk19q,1578441359.0,You got to fight everyday that feeling don’t ever let it sink in you got to push yourself and never stop pushing to win that fight it’s a nightmare I know
nihilism,fdidqkg,t1_fdi8t2u,1578440586.0,"No choices you make lead to that lifestyle it’s not one day you wake up and say “I’m gay” it’s choices you make over time add up to that lifestyle.   It’s a lifestyle of many choices whether you think they are good or bad is up to your view/opinion but that’s basically what it is.    

And you might actually be right my wife might not want to come back because of poor choices I made idk maybe my suffering is my fault actually but I will have to live with this regardless and keep going.  Idk the answer I just know how it goes.  Life isn’t fair but I will be damned if I am going to sit here and say I’m just a “victim” of circumstances I have to fight that BS and I won’t ever stop fighting that false narrative.  Because we do have Free Will and it was given to us the answers aren’t always clear but the foundation is."
nihilism,fdi7cq2,t1_fdi6a8r,1578437032.0,"You could be right maybe I’m just an idiot and my suffering is my fault.  Maybe I just don’t know how to use my Free Will to stop the suffering idk or maybe my choices led me here but either way we all have Free Will that’s not really even the question.

And yes being gay is a choice, it doesn’t just all of a sudden happen and you aren’t born that way."
nihilism,fdi64t0,t1_fdi5z9m,1578436404.0,"I just said I don’t think it’s edgy it’s just boring and stupid to ME personally, but you are right it’s mainstream and “edgy” today"
nihilism,fdi5wa7,t1_fdhsa12,1578436286.0,"So you are saying  being depressed and gay is a mental illness is basically what you said I have no experience in mental illnesses such as these well you can believe whatever nonsense you want but being gay is a choice/many choices I couldn’t care less about the “popular” opinion/view today you won’t push that sht on me I, like everyone else has a right to my view/opinion and I go towards facts/logic not BS that is popular opinion just to fit into some BS"
nihilism,fdi5h7p,t1_fdhuhvd,1578436079.0,"It is basically in the mainstream now of course people still get married and have kids and most people have jobs but I’m saying all the mainstream this is the “cool” like you said “edgy” thing being pushed when in fact it’s not at all, it’s just stupid"
nihilism,fdhrzzm,t1_fdhrlmv,1578429042.0,"Idk if you can choose to be depressed or not but you can be depressed and NOT lazy that’s for sure they aren’t mutually exclusive at all, no one forces you to give into the depression and just lie there.  And yes being gay is a choice as well idk why people choose most things they choose but they do.  I have wondered that question for a long time"
nihilism,fdhr89r,t1_fdhjhlp,1578428595.0,Free Will exists it’s usually people who don’t want to take Personal Responsibility that believe free will doesn’t exist so they don’t have to take any responsibility for their actions/choices/circumstances.   Yea life isn’t fair but that has nothing to do with Free Will and your choices in life.   It’s like being gay/bi it’s a choice whether you think those choices you made to get to that point are good or bad is up to your view/opinion but they are still Free Will choices you made to get to that point.  No one forced you to be that way Personal Responsibility exists as well.
nihilism,fdhqh39,t1_fdgymz1,1578428158.0,Actually this is becoming mainstream these days people are having less kids and it’s not as big of a deal if you don’t check off and do these things like get married and have kids and many people think it’s fine to just take a free ride off welfare as well and are doing it so actually this is NOT counter culture it is becoming the mainstream it’s not “edgy” at all or thought provoking
depression,fdftpyk,t3_el52cn,1578369973.0,I definitely understand that but maybe you won’t lose that person don’t give up.  It’s hard being distant with someone who brightens your world but you just have to keep pushing and hopefully you can reconnect.  And you said you had other good friends that’s something isn’t it.  I literally don’t believe in genuine good friends at this point so for you to have them must be a blessing.
depression,fdft4s0,t3_ekxlzx,1578369550.0,"Sounds like you’ve been through a lot.  First don’t let anyone take advantage of you like that, that’s not right at all you got to confront people calmly but openly  like that or they believe they can just keep doing it.  You need to get that figured out so you can use some of your disability to help you out.  But like someone else said you are definitely a fighter don’t give up there’s always hope I know it doesn’t feel like it I haven’t seen all that but I’ve been isolated for about a decade and it’s gotten to me a lot so I can relate to the feeling like it’s pointless a lot but you have to just keep getting up and fighting don’t let the world win"
depression,fdfb6ze,t1_fdet6nx,1578357581.0,"I hear you OP I’ve been mostly alone for a Decade sucks and than met my soulmate and I don’t even know anymore because here I am alone again with no one.   

And that’s not an upside when you don’t care to do anything especially Alone everything SUCKS. Everything is better with a partner so I don’t really see the upside anymore to being alone other than you aren’t nagged by a bunch of people but even than my own head does that enough anyway"
depression,fdfa5rb,t1_fdf6olo,1578356890.0,It’s not really the over thinking which sucks too it’s the fact that every day is on repeat it’s the same BS over and over and OP I don’t know the answer other than I feel the same way it seems to never end but have to keep going for what I don’t know most days
depression,fdcq3xk,t3_eknr43,1578281220.0,"That weird feeling of is it all real is not something you should listen to of course it’s real to you.  I’ve seen a lot of fake BS and most people with depression aren’t faking it what would be the point it’s a living hell to be here your feelings are valid don’t let anyone make you feel worse because of that weird feeling.

I’ve been where games/hobbies/etc  just get boring after 5-10 mins idk I don’t like playing games anymore really but when I do lately I have been able to play more than 10 mins it’s probably a phase because I have been there than I just moved on from games mostly idk to what lol."
depression,fdcpkr4,t3_eknu8u,1578280830.0,Yep I completely understand that.  Hope just feels like a light that never comes but I keep going for the “maybe someday” hope has given me idk I’m tired really tired
depression,fdcomdn,t3_eknfcv,1578280126.0,Both it’s a little of both I would say.
depression,fdcofod,t3_eklr3t,1578279989.0,"My life is like an extra in some shitty movie falling flat on my face apparently that’s a comedy or something idk.  

So I understand that feeling but don’t get to down on yourself I feel the same way when I get a bad haircut it will grow back."
depression,fdcnz2t,t1_fdccl5b,1578279649.0,Yep idleness sucks but what can you do really just the same BS and “networking” is so fake I don’t really care to do that all the small talk fake BS makes me sick
depression,fdcnqqd,t3_ekkp3f,1578279480.0,"But what is a genuine friend?? Idk I think friends are for kids to have fun with and than you grow up, because like you I haven’t really had any genuine friends and I believe they are Fair Weather in nature.  When sht hits the fan they won’t be around"
depression,fdbu4vg,t3_ekfzdg,1578262101.0,Way of the world these days.  Just have to learn you got to take care of yourself because no one else will and it’s at a point where people don’t care it’s just “what can you do for me” it’s why I stay away from people these days I don’t want to play their silly games
depression,fdbf6ku,t3_ekdmkm,1578256801.0,"You didn’t find that out because it is just a meme by “edgy” people on reddit,  it’s nonsense why people are taking it seriously is beyond me."
depression,fdbes31,t3_ekceuw,1578256648.0,No because what else would I do?? I would find some way to screw things up who knows can’t change it anyway that’s just life
depression,fdazojb,t3_ekdk18,1578252115.0,It’s never going to happen but I wouldn’t care about myself personally but not fair to people who are happy and want to live
depression,fd7fymd,t3_ek8apf,1578203881.0,Yea I hear that I feel the same way most times. There is nothing personally I enjoy much anymore.   You just have to find a reason and it might not be about you anymore.
depression,fd7751h,t3_ek6ok8,1578200303.0,Yes it’s the culture mostly today it’s gotten pretty bad.  And yes that’s just an excuse to make people feel better I never bought it
depression,fd76osp,t3_ek5haq,1578200133.0,Money doesn’t buy happiness though. The best things in life cost nothing it’s just hard to get there regardless of wealth.
Anxiety,fd6qb30,t3_ek6axv,1578194423.0,It’s all BS memes from “edgy” people don’t believe any of it LoL
depression,fd68w0q,t3_ek5npr,1578187306.0,"I hear you I really do I spend all my time alone and yet feels like I’m constantly judged it’s ridiculous.   But you have to realize people in general are selfish and have their own lives and problems it’s hard to face but it’s the truth of the world we are in today.  

I find that friends in general as well are fair weather and when sht goes wrong poof they vanish so fast it will make your head spin.  I really have no interest in that anymore I have learned to take care of myself and not listen to people’s judgements and BS because really if you aren’t in my life what right do you have to comment on anything about it?? I these days just stick to myself"
Anxiety,fd684kg,t1_fd65n3h,1578186942.0,Because it’s not a real threat at all it’s being used as memes by “edgy” people it’s not real.
depression,fd53kuq,t1_fd52143,1578173870.0,I agree this BS tries to tear apart who you really are and turn you into something you aren’t it’s a nightmare but you can’t stop and can’t let it get the best of you it blurs the lines constantly telling you who you are it’s not fair but have to fight it and sometimes literally find that negative voice and yell at it tell it to go to hell.
depression,fd52nmf,t3_ek2o0x,1578173677.0,I’ve felt like that a lot. I understand it feels like you are just going and going and going and for what? Everyday seems like it’s the same or worse nothing seems to grow or get better no matter how hard you try.  But you have to try to keep getting back up otherwise the world wins don’t let this world win you are better than that
depression,fd4tjk2,t3_ejzrj0,1578170949.0,I hope you aren’t taking the WW3 memes seriously because it’s the furthest thing from reality couldn’t be further from the truth.  But otherwise yes the world is going to sht
depression,fd3gpvn,t3_ejv3bh,1578158200.0,Time to get out of the big city it sounds like it’s not been good
depression,fd3gb4i,t3_ejxop1,1578158066.0,That’s life welcome to adulthood
depression,fd3fwe6,t3_ejykrh,1578157913.0,Sometimes resilience is all you have
depression,fd3fmwy,t3_ejwm6m,1578157819.0,Yes those nagging voices are annoying and I completely understand they seem to never go away and just nag nag nag nag it’s ridiculous
depression,fd2lich,t3_ejuob1,1578148922.0,Hard to even see the good things in life but I guess have to try to push the clouds and BS away.  But yes being alone all the time sometimes gets to me but at this point I just want to be left alone mostly
relationship_advice,fd0k6xd,t3_ejrnf6,1578119991.0,Idk I like them.   it’s her body talk to her maybe though as it’s her choice but you can always voice how you feel respectfully even though I would say if it’s that big an issue and she really wants them and you don’t you might need to move on.  Other than big face tattoos I am all for them so I can’t really help you there.
relationship_advice,fd0ek7i,t3_ejslgn,1578117700.0,Being gay/bi is a choice people choose to be gay through choices so you can talk to him about it but sounds like he’s just depressed.
depression,fd0eddu,t3_ejsmvk,1578117624.0,That’s just the nature of friends it’s not a romantic relationship you can’t just count on them like they are your partner/SO because they are Not so probably should realize now they have serious bfs they will not be around as much just how it works.
depression,fd0d9ps,t3_ejskgt,1578117185.0,"Your still in school it’s probably not that hard to make friends still once you are out it gets worse but nothing wrong with having no friends.  I have no friends and I couldn’t care less.  If you want them you can still find them but personally I think friends are a hassle and fair weather I would rather not have them.  I don’t need them

College and work though are good places to meet friends, that is where I would start if you really need friends,  so I would try those as you still are young and school works quite well with that."
relationship_advice,fd0cw9b,t3_ejrtfz,1578117034.0,Probably not a big deal especially that you are no longer in the class but I would still tread lightly on this but sure go for it what have you got to lose?
depression,fd0cb6p,t3_ejs9ve,1578116799.0,When you get like that just drive and maybe listen to music just let it go and it doesn’t matter where you drive just go and you might feel better or maybe not but it can be a way to clear your head.
Anxiety,fczsy4g,t1_fczp6of,1578108077.0,Wasn’t sure what you meant but yes it’s hard though to know what’s in your control
Anxiety,fczm34j,t3_ejpx7o,1578104202.0,You have to realize a lot of things in this world you can’t control.  I hate when things go wrong and have some of those tendencies but I realize unless it’s my choices I can’t really control much and trying will just make you want to pull your hair out.  Especially when other people are involved that’s always a losing battle people are going to do what they do
depression,fczkdls,t3_ejpczs,1578103143.0,Eh I sometimes get pissed off when little things go wrong too because it’s like all the bigger things go wrong it’s just another thing on top of everything that goes wrong so you feel like wtf.
depression,fczk43v,t3_ejpdag,1578102980.0,Probably true and if someone does help it’s usually “what can you do for me”  Not worth it.   Or them playing some kind of game acting like they are a “great” person for helping had that happen before the person was just fucking around playing “Good Samaritan”  you want something done best do it yourself people can’t be trusted.
depression,fczjreb,t3_ejnao7,1578102763.0,Depends.  on here no because you choose to come on depression or anxiety and know what you are getting otherwise yes.
depression,fcystfo,t3_ejls5r,1578086320.0,"It’s good to find productive ways to let off that steam and stress and anxiety.  It’s hard sometimes I know I do that a lot and than I break down and do stupid sht but you need to find an outlet for all of that. I find exercise helps a Little it doesn’t solve everything but it gives me time to let out frustration and try to take back control when everything seems wrong.

And feeling alone I know that well it’s hard when you feel like it’s just you in this alone idk the answer to that because I struggle all the time with it it’s hard but you just have to push yourself through it and not let the BS drag you down."
depression,fcyscn6,t3_ejlpmz,1578086039.0,You can try it again though no one is perfect we are all imperfect trying to get it right. Idk I’ve fallen down more times than I can count yet I have to get back up Fight and try again or what’s the point??  It’s hard to keep going when everything feels like it goes wrong and you feel you can’t get it right I know that feeling but if you don’t stand back up after falling down you just stay there and it’s not going to help anything.  You have to fight that voice telling you to just give up and accept it that is not real it feels sometimes like it is and people may want to push it on you so they can fit you in a neat little box but you have to shout at the voice NO because it’s Wrong.  You can try again nothing is wrong with trying again
depression,fcyqixo,t3_ejlglm,1578085019.0,It’s hard when you don’t have things to look forward to but you have to just keep pushing yourself 99% of the time idk for what but I keep pushing and trying to keep the BS away you can’t win all the battles but you can win the war.
Anxiety,fcykcna,t1_fcyk07l,1578081576.0,"O I don’t listen to BS Just because people babble about it constantly making it seem to some people that it’s real because of some worthless public opinion or more accurately an echo chamber, that isn’t reality.  

What I’m more concerned about is people actually follow and believe this sht that’s the scary part is anyone takes it seriously like wtf."
Anxiety,fcyjua8,t3_ejkn3f,1578081289.0,Yea that’s not even “news” it’s a bunch of pointless ridiculous memes and BS. Why people believe it is beyond me I don’t get how people just listen to whatever popular opinions at the time are it’s really gotten bizarre.
nihilism,fcyhqfe,t1_fcyfrxo,1578080368.0,And yes “people lived for hundreds of thousands of years without technology” that was a DIFFERENT time it’s not today I was obviously born in the wrong generation because I don’t want this sht but it’s like anything once it’s here it’s here.  It’s like fucking idiots trying to say banning guns and Gun Control will solve anything they already exist you can’t get rid of them now banning or trying to control them does NOTHING.  Same for technology I understand very well it’s here to stay you can’t go back you can only go forward.
nihilism,fcygrhv,t1_fcyfrxo,1578079834.0,Now now now smug condescending jackass in today’s age technology is necessary.  I don’t need it personally you are right I could go off and live in the middle of no where and survive just fine alone but to communicate with basically anyone these days and Live in SOCIETY it’s necessary.   If you live in society you are stuck with this technology that’s just the way it is today.   Technology isn’t essential I agree I wish we didn’t have all this BS and could go back to times that were simpler but if you live in today’s society it becomes essential. I have thought long and hard about saying fuck it and just going somewhere without any technology but as long as I’m in society it’s necessary
depression,fcyek1w,t3_ejfnst,1578078959.0,I feel the same way most the time I feel like I keep going and going and going and falling down and falling down and getting back up and falling down but it doesn’t ever seem to get better or go anywhere it’s the same struggle everyday alone in this world struggling in the dark.  Idk I’m just tired and don’t even know how to feel anymore it’s like this world has beat me senseless than says fuck you everytime I try to get back up.  Idk what to think half the time anymore
depression,fcydmiv,t3_ejjx1q,1578078457.0,Yes life is much scarier than death. I don’t fear death much anymore it’s life that is becoming the nightmare.  It’s existing that is hard not so much death.  Hope seems to be the light you keep chasing and you just keep chasing it never catching it idk I’m just tired of chasing a light that never comes
depression,fcy77ea,t1_fcxtlzm,1578075811.0,Exactly why do people believe this nonsense in the first place???? Really WW3??? lol give me a break
depression,fcy7266,t3_ejhv9u,1578075750.0,You are worrying over NOTHING.  There is not going to be a WW3 and further more why people are believing a bunch of “edgy” memes is beyond me no one who knows politics is taking this WW3 nonsense seriously go find Bigfoot and the lochness monster and a unicorn and aliens all first than we can talk about the likelihood of WW3
Anxiety,fcy6iqg,t3_ejj88t,1578075492.0,Please try to put it out of your head it’s NOT Real no serious person who knows politics is taking this seriously.  WW3 is no where near reality it’s a bunch of bored “edgy” people making memes that’s it not news at all so just let it go

You need to realize that’s completely Fake News and just some bored people making memes for what reason idk but it’s not real at all.  So just relax it isn’t real no serious person in politics believes truly WW3 is here
depression,fcy36sy,t1_fcy1g01,1578074123.0,“You need to be connected to things and people around you” LOL good luck with that people are impossible these days to connect with so full of themselves and BS I can’t be bothered with 99% of people so that actually .001% of people I tolerate is pretty rare most people I can’t connect with at all
depression,fcy2dxr,t3_eji660,1578073877.0,I don’t really think you need friends to help with depression personally I don’t believe friends are anything but fair weather so they might make you more depressed having them when they just up and poof abandon you out of the blue.   You can’t really count on friends like that especially if you have depression they will be gone in a second like you allude to in your Original Post.  I no longer ever want to have a friend again period for what???
depression,fcy0dbt,t3_ejft23,1578072937.0,What do you do when you usually do eat right and work out and all that and it’s still a nightmare??

nihilism,fcxw3ao,t1_fcpo6of,1578071330.0,Technology mostly is a disease but we live in a world you have to have it unless you want to abandon everyone and go live off the land in like Alaska or somewhere  is the only way you can get rid of this BS technology so no cognitive dissonance I’m stuck in this stupid technological world.
nihilism,fcxvn46,t1_fcnkfv9,1578071181.0,It does we live in a technology world jackass. You can’t just get rid of it when people need you and they aren’t in the same household  or for your job or a thousand other reasons you need to have this technology doesn’t mean you want it.
depression,fcwinwv,t1_fcwiap2,1578026650.0,Depends how much you drank.  Could be days if it’s a bad lingering hang over as well

EDIT:  also what kind of friend are you to come in here and call your supposed “friend” out instead of backing him up when he was called such things??? Loyalty over stupid ass “social PC” nonsense in my book"
depression,fcwbheq,t3_ej99js,1578021557.0,Well I feel that way all the time it sucks having to keep going and asking for what??? But we just keep going idk why most the time part of it is just plain stubbornness I’m really tired though and every day seems harder than the last.   I have these hopes that idk if they are real anymore but it’s all I have left.
depression,fcw80lc,t3_ej6s27,1578019254.0,No I think it exists it’s just about impossible to hold onto and yes some of it relies on delusion
depression,fcw69f8,t1_fcw5dh2,1578018114.0,That’s life people only care what you can do for them and than they will abandon you that’s life just got to look out for yourself.

Anxiety,fcvhlcn,t3_ej3wqu,1578002251.0,Yea that was the most retarded part of school/ especially college was introducing yourself to a bunch of Random people you will probably never even talk to trying to find something stupid to say to fill it out like no one cares anyway.
depression,fcuoel6,t3_eitqvt,1577985280.0,Yea I feel the same way it’s a never ending cycle of saying how you feel and it taken the wrong way and you feel like a burden because she shuts down and you feel worse like you are a worthless burden to her and on and on it goes
depression,fcunptp,t3_eiw1n0,1577984895.0,I guess that’s life idk I feel like that 24/7 and spend 24/7 alone so I guess I mostly am alone but it’s like o well it doesn’t really matter in the end.
relationship_advice,fcumwc6,t1_fcub2d7,1577984422.0,That’s today’s world we live in it’s always but what’s around the corner maybe it’s better.
