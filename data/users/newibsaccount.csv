Imodium works fantastically well for me. I can be reasonably sure I won't need to poop about 6-18 hours after taking it. However I find it difficult to get the dosing right over multiple days, which makes extended trips extremely stressful. So, no vacations, no overnight trips.

Despite that limitation, I manage to live a pretty full life. I manage to go running with friends once a week (thanks Imodium!) and hiking about once a week in summer (also Imodium). Exercise helps a lot with switching off background anxiety so I don't obsess too much about situations in advance. I'm very lucky to be able to access beautiful countryside with a journey of an hour or less.

>i do my research on restaurants and peoples houses before i go to determine how many bathrooms are there and if there's somewhere near by to escape to in order to go the bathroom if necessary.

I do this too to some extent. I enjoy going to restaurants and people's houses that I already know or in areas of town that I know well.

Recently I've gone vegan and started eating a lot more fibre and a lot less fat, which has reduced urgency for me. That helps. I still poop multiple times a day but now I can normally wait 20 minutes for the bathroom rather than going from nothing to agonising cramps in 30 seconds."

She might be upset, she might not. The non-pregnant woman would likely also feel violated by the attack. I'd expect a judge to take both their victim impact statements into account when sentencing."
