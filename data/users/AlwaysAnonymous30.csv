depression,fft8joi,t3_ev42ty,1580212243.0,"Heard and read. My ex was the same, no help none whatsoever when I needed help with my depression. But still I don't think your gf has any right to say things like that to you. Don't know her but she doesn't sound very supportive. If you feel like you want to talk to a professional then do it! At least you are trying."
depression,fft4nnz,t3_ev35w5,1580206906.0,"Read your post and I care. Your life matters just as much as the next. I know how it feels to be so alone and not being able to trust anyone. It sucks. I'm not going to say it will get better because no one knows for sure. Wish you all the best and if you need to vent, you have every right to do so."
depression,fft47kn,t3_ev2oox,1580206216.0,"Cheating sucks. Long or short distance, a relationship is still a relationship. Wish you all the best."

depression,ffsyxb2,t3_ev2gol,1580198399.0,You are not a coward. Try to stay strong and just remember that your life matters too. You are stronger than you know.
depression,ffsxlg7,t3_ev1f1z,1580196684.0,I'm sorry you are going through sucj difficult times. Vent more if needed and just remember that your life matters too.
depression,ffsna6i,t3_euwzq5,1580186099.0,"I read your post, not a waste of my time. Sometimes it's good to just vent and let it all out. I saw a lot of myself in this so I guess at least to a certain point I know how you feel. At least you were able to tell us how you feel, I can't even do that because depression = complaining, heard it all my life. I'm not going to say it gets better because nothing is certain but your life matters too. If you want to change you have to be brave enough to take the first step and it's not going to be easy.

And keep on playing those videogames! I have zero passion to play anymore and it really sucks because playing was the only good thing in my life."

AskWomen,ffpszhx,t1_ffp1141,1580104584.0,"Whoa, that's some serious shit!! Unbelievable. Yeah, I'm the same, I don't believe in the 'best friend' idea anymore and I sure as hell don't want to get hurt like that again."
AskWomen,ffpss1w,t1_ffor05i,1580104371.0,That sucks! I can't even imagine how you must've felt. Being a friend is too much asked.

AskWomen,ffnk6vv,t3_eu8p6k,1580067058.0,My best friend stabbed me in the back when I needed her the most. She always blamed me for everything. So in the end it was very easy to let her go.
