college,ffiz1n0,t1_ffilz1v,1579986239.0,"Lmao, attendance is mandatory at the uni I'm studying at in Poland; you miss more than 3 classes and you get dropped from that class

One of the many reasons why I'm transferring back to the states next year tbh, European education isn't all that it's made out to be"

UpliftingNews,ffbph6r,t1_ffbp07k,1579777195.0,"I dunno if I'd say it's to keep democrats in office, but it's definitely pretty strange to say the least. Just goes to prove that people in power will generally find ways to abuse that power"
UpliftingNews,ffbpfht,t1_ffbnskq,1579777126.0,"Kinda behind a soft paywall tho, but I get the point; it can lead to less voters, but there's still methods to be able to vote even without it; you just need proof of assembly constituency, and something like a job card, passport, health insurance smart card, etc to get a voter slip from the ECI and can act as a voter card"
UpliftingNews,ffbp935,t1_ffbnio9,1579776864.0,"I mean, there's quite a few:

It's a reliable form of identification, acknowledgement that the voter is duly registered, has a photograph, signature, or fingerprints to prove that the voter is who they claim to be, can prevent multiple voting, can be designed in response to low literacy rates, can be used when you have no fixed address, and more."

poland,ffbjerj,t1_ff9yk3r,1579768108.0,"Maybe, but people hype up European universities so much and the uni I'm studying at right now is basically aids"
UpliftingNews,ffbdcgx,t3_eslgi8,1579760548.0,"That's pretty good, but let's not forget they are in the process of passing SJ29, SB65, and SJ6 - eliminating photo IDs for voting, making it so the governor is elected by majority of votes in congressional districts instead of statewide majority, and increasing the term limit for the governor to 8 years is questionable."
college,ff36my2,t3_er72ir,1579534941.0,"Honestly yes; I'm in a kinda mediocre situation where I thought I'd like studying in Europe, but now looking if I can transfer back to the states for next year at a reasonable cost - classes are tough at my uni because alot of the teachers are reaaally mediocre so not only am I studying in a different language but I also gotta teach alot of material to myself that the professor should be.

It's alot of stress personally especially because it wasn't entirely my decision to study here, but that's another matter"
AskReddit,fc2up8j,t3_efqzp6,1577374553.0,"The fact that I have to go back to Europe to a college I don't really like and a dorm that sucks tbh

Can't wait to transfer next year."
