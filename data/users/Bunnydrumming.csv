LoveIslandTV,fei0p9s,t1_fegtsz9,1579127748.0,I was not involved but I work for a different council who added to their critical incident plan following this incident. What we were told was that emails went out asking for ‘volunteers’ across local councils - only aimed at employees who could be released from their usual role so council employees were released from whatever job they were doing for as long as their manager could spare them.  They received their normal wages.  Most councils give workers 3 paid days to volunteer in any chosen charity each year  anyway - they time they were doing the volunteering role wasn’t limited to just those 3 days but as king as they could be spared.  We were told that 100’s of council employees played various roles on the day and in the weeks following - many volunteers worked longer days and weekends along side 100’s of volunteers ewho supported local charities each day.  It was a huge response.

Yrs there is a conservation element but it’s not what’s at the heart of animals being shot for sport. I have a friend who runs a rescue farm in S Africa and another who owns a safari park there and their view is there is a lot of corruption and money making is at the centre of trophy hunting.  True conservationists constantly come up with other ways to stop over-population in some areas of animals, including transporting them to other areas or countries but this costs money and so isn’t popular.  The friend who owns the safari park says he has a lot of pressure put on him to allow shooting on the land he owns. He has considered selling up because of that pressure but knows the people who buy it would turn it into another shooting lodge. He also says that most locals hate that foreigners come to their country to shoot their wildlife."

Baking,fcamm5t,t3_egdpsl,1577572250.0,"This is the recipe from janespatisserie.com.  After saving 16 pieces of the chocolate orange for cookies there wasn’t much left to chop up so I added galaxy chocolate instead and an extra 1/2 teaspoon of orange extract.  I have an aga which bakes hot so they only needed 8-10 minutes and I put the orange on when they came out and didn’t bother putting them back in the oven. Everyone says they are their favourite cookie. 

IngredientS
125 g Unsalted Butter
100 g Granulated Sugar
100 g Light Brown Sugar
1 Medium Egg
1 tsp Vanilla Extract (optional)
25 g Cocoa Powder
175 g Self Raising Flour
1/2 tsp Bicarbonate of Soda
1/2 tsp Baking Powder
1/2 tsp Salt
Zest of 1 Large Orange (or 1tsp orange extract)
250 g Terry's Chocolate Orange (chopped)
16 Segments Terry's Chocolate Orange


Instructions
Preheat your oven to 190C/180C Fan/375F and line three baking trays with parchment paper
Mix together the butter and sugars until light and fluffy and thoroughly combined – I often use an electric mixer for this bit as it makes it so much easier and combines the ingredients very well – but good ol’ manpower will work too!
Add the vanilla essence and the beaten egg, and mix again briefly. 
Add the cocoa powder, flour, bicarbonate of soda, baking powder, salt and orange and mix until a thick paste/cookie dough is formed. (Or add it all in together!)
Chop the chocolate orange pieces and add to the mixture and fold through
Spoon the mixture onto the trays and make sure they are suitable spread out so they stay separate! (I usually fit 6 on each tray to be safe) I also use a cookie dropper/ice cream scoop to make them identical sizes.
Bake in the oven for 10 minutes – remove quickly and add a segment to each cookie, and then bake for another 1-2 minutes. 
Once baked, remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly before gobbling up otherwise you might burn yourself on molten chocolate!"
