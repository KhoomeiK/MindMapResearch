“Can quitting smoking during pregnancy reduce a baby's health risks?

Absolutely. If you smoke, quitting is the best way to give your baby a healthy start. Quitting smoking at any point during pregnancy can help. Your baby will begin to receive more oxygen even just one day after you quit. But quitting before week 15 of pregnancy provides the greatest benefits for your baby, and quitting before your third trimester can eliminate much of the potential impact on your baby's birth weight.”
