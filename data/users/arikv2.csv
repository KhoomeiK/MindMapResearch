It's very easy for it to get away from you, and additionally making sure every possible string has a consistent experience and makes sense is a lot of work. I'll be honest it was very challenging.  Okay as for advice: have crazy options, and have crazy payoffs for those options. Don't police the story, if they want to push someone off a building, write the most interesting thing that would happen from that choice.
