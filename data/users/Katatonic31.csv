dogs,ffpm4y4,t1_ffpaeid,1580098470.0,You really should cause I'd be interested to know! My girls only raises between her shoulder blades. A pittie in our complex gets it between her shoulder blades and right above her tail.
Dogtraining,ffpi2iv,t1_ffp1bw6,1580095566.0,"Just be careful in that using this method you arent going to teach him that he has to pee on that object. Dogs arent like people and really dont care so much about aim.

So they wouldn't understand the praise is about their aim, but more likely what they're peeing on rather than how they pee on it, lol. What your describing is a lot like how people train dogs to use pee pads inside. 

So just be mindful and careful that you dont retrain potty breaks. Humans are one of the only animals that care about location and aim."
Dogtraining,ffopn5e,t3_eudz8c,1580080236.0,"Learning to pee like that for males isnt just instinctual. Most Male puppies squat to pee till a certain age (some never stop) and then they learn how to pee lifting a leg. It will take some practice on their part to figure out how to do it right. My Male corgi peed on himself for the better part of three months before he finally got the hang of it, lol."
dogs,ffo02dj,t3_euchyq,1580072837.0,"I agree with what everyone else has said. I would look into a behavorlist specialist first. The methods this board and train trainer uses can actually make the fear based reactions worse as they add the element of pain and shock to whatever reaction the dog is having. Now, not only are they scared of it, but the have the association of pain along with the fear. 

I would also recommend against board and train for fear aggressive dogs. Part of helping them get over fears is building a bond and trust with you. A dog that doesnt feel like its need to be afraid will react less. You cant get this by sending them away and hoping someone else will fix the issue. You have to put in the time and energy with him yourselves or you're likely to have a relapse every time he comes home. Training with a dog is one of the best ways to build a strong and lasting bond. Find a behavorlist that will either come to your house (most do) or has a private and safe facility."
dogs,ffncqnl,t1_ffn7pot,1580064359.0,"Dogs with no tails also often run into trouble at dog parks because other dogs have a harder time reading their posture and body language. It's one on the reasons I wish my girls breeder hadn't docked her tail, but cest la vie."
dogs,ffn8ucq,t1_ffn0qck,1580063173.0,"Those are some adorable ears! My girl has the corgi ears and shes very expressive with them too, lol. When shes really happy and wants attention, they're in a backwards relaxed position. When shes scared though they are pressed back tight against the side of her head. 

When shes nervous or confused they drop down straight from the side. 

When shes hyper aware they are tensely forward."
dogs,ffmue4p,t3_eu972i,1580059031.0,"Raised hackles can mean anything from excitment to fear. The reason so many people equate it to aggression is because q dog that will attack is exhibiting one of these emotions and the owner likely misread the cue. My little girl is terrified of only ONE dog in my apartment complex and any time we have to wall by their door her hackles go up, but I know it's because shes scared. There is also a Boston terrier that is probably the only dog I know that has more energy than her. When he comes around the hackles go up cause shes super excited and after the greeting and play, they're back to normal. 

The tail wag is often misread in breeds with docked tails. And most commonly then in breeds like the boxer. People like me, with a docked tail dog, need to learn the difference between and wag and the ""twitch"". Unless my girls whole butt is wiggling, we proceed with caution. 

Another big one I see is ears. People misread ear position and think forward and alert is happy and back is angry. My girl has some huge ears and they are always back and relaxed when shes happy, but when they're forward and super alert when approaching a person or new dog, we are vigilant because super focus could be an indication of discomfort or too super focus. 

These are some good tips you're pointing out ;) I always recommend that new or inexperienced dogs owners research doggie body language before hand."
Dogtraining,fffxdb0,t3_etev25,1579893873.0,"Ouch and redirect never worked with my girl, but what did was ignoring and time outs. When she bit, I'd get up and walk to the other side if the room and ignore her. Or I'd put her in her play pen for about 3 to five minutes. She soon began to associate the act of biting with play stopping and it worked rather quickly for her.

You can also teach the ""leave it"" command that worked best when she tried to land shark my slippers."
puppy101,ffedk50,t1_ffec9bk,1579844081.0,"The OP has worked with a vet that tried anti-anxiety medication and admitted they doubted it would have any effect and went to euthanasia as the second option when there are so many other things that could be tried, rather than an admittedly poor choice, by the vet.

Yes, she had the opinion of a vet and a trainer. But not all professionals in these fields are of the same caliber. In the same way not all human doctors are of the same caliber. I have dealt with some absolutely amazing vets in my time as a pet owner, and yet I have also dealt with some really awful ones. I had a vet tell me once that my dog was likely limping after a fall because it was sore and they didnt feel xrays were needed. To just bring him home and let him rest. A day later and a still severely hurt dog lead to me going back and getting the same advice and being given anti inflammatory medication. Two days later, and it was worse, so this time I went to a different vet that did an xray immediately and found a fracture in the dogs leg. 

The same goes for trainers. I worked with a certified trainer once that told me my dogs resource gaurding would never get better and to just learn to manage it. Two sessions with a different trainer and his resource guarding was gone and never came back. 

And please dont think I'm telling you off or putting you down. You do make valid points, and I fully agree that rehoming to another normal home is not a good choice. I suppose I shouldn't be using that term in what I mean, as that sounds like what I'm saying. Surrendering to a reactive dog rescue or shelter is more what I'm getting at. A place that is equipped to deal with the issues while the dog grows up and can put forward the financial means to exhaust all the medical avenues, rather than prescribing the wrong type of medication and then simply throwing hands up.

And it's also hard to tell exactly what avenues where exhausted as the details were that prosaic was prescribed and didnt work so the vet suggested euthanasia. Were proper allergy tests run? Hormonal boards? Cat scans or the likes? 

It is a highly emotional situation, and my whole heart goes out to the OP for having to deal with this and face this. It is a completely heartbreaking situation and which her all the best and support in this time. But she wanted advice on other options and people that have expierenced this before in young puppies are doing that and all they can to offer choices (responsible ones) and shared experiences to help alleviate some of the stress and heartache."
puppy101,ffeby46,t1_ffe9j0x,1579842569.0,"The people saying rehome are advising to rehome the dog to someone with expierence with reactive dogs and can work with such a young pup to give it a full chance at life. 

Yes, rehoming an aggressive dog to just anyone is highly irresposible and likely would not be an advised option for an older dog. But at 6 months old it's far too young to pull the plug after the only thing the vet tries is a medication not even designed for the presented issue. 

There are many rescues and shelters that will take in young puppoes with behavioral issues, such as aggression, in order to ensure that every Avenue is exhausted. This means medically and training wise.

Yes, genetics could be an issue. That is absolutely true. But without clear knowledge of the parents disposition it's hard and unfair to the puppy to rule it as such without trying everything else. As stated before, certain allergies, especially to foods, can cause this aggressive behavior in dogs and is highly treatable with clears up the issues. 

That is why people are suggesting to rehome the pup to someone expierenced or a rescue (in the case the owner cant or wont go this avenue). Every young pup deserves all the chances before just ending it."
puppy101,ffeawx5,t1_ffeai1l,1579841638.0,"Exactly! Such levels of aggression in a such a young dog is usually a sign that something *is* medically wrong. Be it an allergy or one of the dozens of other things. 

My family had a dog when I was younger that had much the same issue. As a puppy she was so aggressive that our parents kept us separate while they did tests. Turns out it was an allergy (cant remember to what because I was like six) and with the proper treatment she turned into the sweetest thing in the world. I bawled when she dinallyvhad to be put down at 15. But she was the dog that started my whole family's love of dogs. Now between the six of us, we have nine dogs at all family events, lol. 

Never accept euthanasia as a second option to one admittedly dodgy attempt at health care, especially not for a six month old."
puppy101,ffe9zoy,t1_ffe8rmw,1579840831.0,"Absolutely. Euthanasia should only be considered for an adult dog that extensive health tests and expierence has shown without a shadow of a doubt is living a miserable life. I have known so many people that have had aggressive seeming puppies that turned into sweet loving dogs with proper behavioral training combined with *proper* vet care. Not ""here is a pill that i will admit isnt really meant for this situation. Didnt work? Ah well, put it down then!""

I'm also disturbed by a trainer that would recommend euthanizing a 6 month old puppy before recommending more extensive medical research. Just because *you* could not fix it does not make the dog a lost cause.

Honestly, I think the OP has leaned on some poor professional help. And not all by her fault. You *want* to trust your vet and your trainer. It's so sad when they let you down. I truly think the OP needs to seek another vet, a specialist perhaps, and an aggressive/reactive training specialist. A 6 months old there so, so many options and steps that come between trying an anti anxiety pill for aggression (honestly, what was that vet thinking?) And euthanasia."
puppy101,ffe8c5r,t1_ffe6r9d,1579839457.0,"I 100npercent agree with this. At her age, it's very hard to determine that you are dealing with an actually aggressive dog and that its nor causes by any number of health issues. 

Rehoming to a place/person that specializes in these sort of things would be a much less stressful choice on you and a choice at getting the puppy a happy life. This is not to say you wouldn't, but some dogs require a lot of expierence to deal with their issues. 

I might also suggest going to another vet for a second opinion. I find it a little disturbing that your vet simply threw prosaic at it and then determined the only other option was to put down a six month old puppy."
dogs,ffe2eo4,t3_et3wyq,1579834924.0,"I'm sorry, but I dislike behavior like this. There is nothing wrong with getting a shelter dog *or* a purebred from a reputable breeder. It comes down to personal preference and no one should feel guilted or shamed for choosing to go with a breeder. 

Price alone is not always an honest factor either. I almost rescued a puppy once, until the shelter said the adoption fee was going to be $550 because they were under two years old and not considered an adult dog. So I backed out because I couldn't see spending that amount on a dog that, after a visit, was clearly a dog with behavioral issues and would cost me more money later down the road. However my father got his purebred from a reputable breeder for 400 because he was already 6-7 months old. 

My sister and brother have both been harrassed by people out in public with their dogs because of people with this view point to the point they no longer go to dog parks, which is sad cause their dogs loved it. What is even more sad, my brothers pure bred IS a rescue dog. Hed been removed from a home where he was locked in a crate outside all day every day, and got a second chance at life when my brother found him in a shelter.

Shelter dog does not mean a mutt. Many shelters are also filled with purebred dogs. My dog is a mutt, and came from a breeder. My brothers is pure breed and came from a shelter.

All dogs need a loving home. No matter where they started in life."

dogs,ffdkteb,t3_et1huk,1579822994.0,"Most dogs dont like smoke or the smell of it AMD will avoid smokey areas. It's a built in animal instinct of ""fire! Run!"" Even humans have it, we just believe our own instinct is more sophisticated, lol."
dogs,ffdj57m,t3_esznn5,1579821972.0,"As many have said, go to your vet for medical care. The majority of the over the counter medical supplies for dogs is just full of junk that sound impressive but dont really do anything. You think you're saving money, but that's only because your buying a cheap product."
puppy101,ffdigh8,t3_et1bf9,1579821555.0,"Enforced naps.

When puppies get over tired they can become super demons, so make sure you are enforcing a nap time. Most people I've seen, myself included, do for one hour of play or activity, two hours nap time. This means crate or play pen away from activity."
Dogtraining,ffd3fum,t1_ffd3cjf,1579812662.0,My vet told me that's actually a very good indicator of them having that issue.
Dogtraining,ffcuju4,t3_eswp8b,1579807549.0,"Have you tried baby wipes? 

My girl had a similar issue and I thought uti as well. However my vet took the time to explain to me that young females, when they squat, tend to press right up against the ground. This can cause a build up of dirt and grime that is super irritating and can cause a sort of vaginitis. They then spot pee frequently to relieve the irritation of the grime.

I had to wipe her down with a unscented baby wipe when I brought her back inside from a regular pee break, and it really, really helped. The spot peeing is almost completely gone. 

Hope it helps!"
puppy101,ffctub9,t3_eswpol,1579807138.0,"Is she going a lot? And I mean peeing like every 15 20 minutes? 

I went through a similar problem with my little girl, and it turns out it wasnt a training problem but a health problem. Because females squat to pee, the rub against the ground and can collect dirt and grime in the vagina that causes irritation and a type of puppy vaginitis. 

She was constantly having accidents in her crate and in the house. I'd take her out, praise, and 15 minutes later she was peeing in the house. It drove me nuts. However I talked to my vet and ended up getting an unscented baby wipe. After she went outside, I wiped her down. It has helped tremendously. The accidents in the crate stopped in a day or two and the spot peeing is way way down. 

Also, how much room does she have in the crate? She should only have enough to turn around and lay down comfortably. Too much more than that will give her the ability to go to the bathroom and then not lay in it. Also try feeding her her meals in the crate. Dogs dont like to eliminate where they eat and sleep. 

If you dont catch her in the act, dont yell at her and bring her outside with her potty. This could actually be enforcing the idea that going in the house is getting her brought outside. It's only showing her that potty in the house means going outside. If you find it in the house simply clean it up while ignoring her. When she goes outside, make it the most exciting event ever. This will show her that going inside creates no reaction while going outside created the best reaction!

Good luck!"
dogs,ffc5wb6,t3_estwz6,1579792266.0,"My little girl does it with sneezing, lol. She could be dead asleep on the other side of the room, but if I sneeze she pops up and comes running over throwing herself at me and licking my face like shes trying to make sure I'm not dying. Once she realizes I'm fine, she goes and lays back down. But it's only when I sneeze. I actually have found it adorable. Like I have a little nurse."
dogs,ffc5h5l,t1_ffc2phu,1579791981.0,"Exactly this. Never physically abuse a dog for doing what is natural to them. You could go from teaching them the overall behavior is not wanted to not only teaching them that particular behavior (growling) is not acceptable so they by pass it altogether. 

It will also form a negative association between the dog and son. Kid comes in the room, I get hurt. So they escalate the behavior to keep the kid away to avoid pain.

Physical punishment is never a good option when training negative behavioral responses as *we* see them in regards to no other people and other dogs."
Dogtraining,ffb92iy,t1_ffb8jww,1579755653.0,"It really is! It also works wonders on curbing demand barking which is a huge hurdle with herding breeds. Teaching this behavior without needing the command just makes things so easy and pleasant. My girl had started cycling through all her known tricks, and I would respond when she performed the wanted behavior.

She will sit and wait for the ""go ahead"" to dive into her bowl, no matter how excited she is for it. When shes hungry, she will walk over and lay down in front of the door to the pantry her food is in and remain there until her bowl is full. When she needs to go out, she goes and sits beneath her leash on the hook. 

Behavior training creates such a good bond and I recommend it to anyone."
dogs,ffb8mcl,t1_ffb814s,1579755146.0,"If separation works best for your life style, by all means stick to that. It's your household so you'll know what method works best for you! 

And trust me, right there with you on the father front, lol. Mine lives with me part time as well, and when I first got my girl it was a struggle to get him to listen to me and what I wanted for training. I'm far more structured and hes more ""live and let live"" which simply does not work for the level of energy and intelligence my little cowboy corgi (half corgi, half australian cattle dog) has in her. He thinks I'm ""too strict"" but he finally listened when he saw how well behaved and happy she was and how she was flourishing.  

But do not believe the cliche that you cant teach an old dog new tricks. You absolutely can! Corrective behavior training has no age limit. Granted it maybe more work to retrain ingrained behaviors, but it can be done! Especially with herding breeds that are known for being highly intelligent.  

If need be, you can even speak to your vet about your concerns with behavior. Some vets are or have behavioralists on staff or can recommend things or places to go to help.

Best of luck hun, I'm sure you will all be just fine with patience, calm, and work."
Dogtraining,ffb7xv3,t1_ffb7qat,1579754426.0,"I did this with my little treat snapper and it worked like a charm. So I def second this method.

I also taught her the wait command/behavior for anything ediable. Treats, food, water, chews. She now will sit patiently and wait for the okay before taking anything. It amazed my father the first time he put down her water bowl and she simply sat down and looked up to him for the okay as she was only 3 months old at the time and his 7 month old puppy still nearly knocked the bowl out if his hand. Lol."
dogs,ffb784c,t1_ffb6715,1579753682.0,"Dont lose hope! With patience and proper training changes may be possible.

At 2, your son is still at an age where understanding doggie manners is not solid. Even my niece that has grown up with two dogs her whole life needs to be reminded of them. (Especially around my puppy, who is luckily good natured and puts up no fuss at being toted around by a 3 year old like a stuffed animal until we stop her). Young children often need to be reminded what is acceptable around a dog. 2 is still a baby! Lol. When he gets older, the understanding will be more firm. 

Also remember how off the wall your dog likely was as a puppy. That was their toddler stage. And often times, their puppy energy was too much for older dogs. This could be a clear case of what's going on. Your son is reaching a new stage in energy and your senior dog could be going ""wtf, it *walks* now too?!""

Keeping them separated is a great idea, and any time they're near each other it should be under close observation. You can even go so far as to tether the dog to yourself so that you can catch and correct negative behavior much quicker. 

I would honestly suggest a behavioralist to help you with the situation since a child is involved. You can find some affordable ones that will come right to your home in order to help you to the best effects. 

Dont lose heart hun! Therw could very easily be a light at the end of this tunnel!"
