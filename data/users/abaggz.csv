PlanetFitnessMembers,ff65xi5,t3_erokpc,1579619915.0,"Hi! I go to PF, and to be honest, I'm probably one of the people there who may intimidate others. I have dabbled on and off in bodybuilding, so I'd say I dont ""belong"" there. BUT what i will also say is that i know where i go to the gym, and i know how other people feel when there. To get to the point, DO NOT be afraid to ask for help. See a girl whos arms you like? Ask what she does. Need help with a machine you're not sure how to use? Ask someone nearby!!! I have had many women approach me asking various things, and every single time, my heart melts. PF is a mentality - we all want to be our best selves, and as far as I have experienced, no one is above helping other achieve that!!"

IIFYM,fdqsbxx,t1_fdqmyij,1578673825.0,"To be 100% honest, with that low of calories, I would have assumed you were female!! The macro split kind of gave it away though. I guess it depends why you're keeping them so low. My only warning for you is that it is very possible that your weightloss will stall out before you get down to 193 and you'll have to cut your calories more or add in cardio. I'm a female, around 151 pounds right now eating at 2100 a day, slowly losing weight and I can tell you I dont have half of the muscle you do! I've done bikini comps and it wasn't until about a month out that my calories would be where yours are currently. I'll just say, tread lightly & listen to your body!"
