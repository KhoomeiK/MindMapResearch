Thanks for your support."
netflixwitcher,fd03sp1,t1_fd02gsc,1578113211.0,Yes. We werent convinced by anything - just told that it's a thing and that's one of my pet peeves in movies and tv.
offmychest,fd01c49,t1_fd00esp,1578112161.0,Thanks for that. Yeah that's similar. I guess I just get anxiety over what people think of me and since I dont talk very much or express those kinds of opinions I feel weird about it.
offmychest,fczzpxj,t1_fczzgah,1578111429.0,"I guess it's just my anxiety talking and how much I had invested in it when in retrospect it's not that good. 

But thanks. I appreciate it."
witcher,fczyblj,t3_ej2qyy,1578110728.0,"I agree. I am disappointed by the lack of cohesion of the world feeling real.  I've only played the witcher 3 game for about an hour or so and it felt more complete. A lot of things in the show was fun because they were kind of from the game like the potions and magic that he has (which I wish they explained).

I wish they had explained some of the world a bit more instead of it being so rushed. Game of Thrones did an excellent job of this. Even with me knowing some things, I don't really care about the magical forest Ciri is in or the Nilfgaardians because...why would I? I care about Geralt and Yennifer, but not really anyone else...

I watched 3 episodes and raved about it to my coworker who also had started watching it and I was so excited about Henry Cavill's Geralt being so game-like I didn't even realize how it wasn't good (my coworker only said that she had to forget he was superman lol) but she didn't tell me waht she thought about it and she probably thought it was cringe fantasy and didn't want to tell me.

ugh, I wish it were better. I'm going to try to finish the game since it feel more complete and I'm just more invested. Geralt even feels more multidimensional as a game character..."
witcher,fczwev6,t1_fcv2srf,1578109769.0,"Yeah I wish destiny was explained more as ""the gods"" or something instead of just repeating the word over and over...it reminds me of the lord of light or something in Game of Thrones who chooses who gets to come back to life until they serve their purpose, but that was easier to swallow than destiny for some reason. I guess maybe because there was no mention of any superstitions or higher powers until that moment and it came off as really cringe. The idea didn't marinate enough."
witcher,fczu2fh,t1_fczt43b,1578108619.0,"Yeah I wish it was explained more but instead all I heard was ""your destiny, my destiny, our destiny, don't mess with destiny"" ...wish it was written a bit better and some evidence provided outside of the hedgehog guy and the wedding."
witcher,fczpstj,t1_fcu2v35,1578106461.0,"I feel like ""destiny"" could be replaced by ""the gods"" or some other magic...kind of like the lord of light in GoT bringing certain people back from the dead for purposes. I'm guessing it sounds better in polish or something..."

I read an awful review of it and i get the problems people have with it if they're not paying attention or think it's too ""video game-y"" when I don't think it is. I also dont know all the source material but I do feel it is rushed but knowing it's based on short stories makes sense."
freefolk,fcx0rum,t1_fcx0an0,1578046082.0,"Thanks you too!!

With the witcher by ep 3 I was so into it and raved about it to my coworkers but now in ep 4 I'm seeing the cracks and not so sure. I almost done with ep 4 of the witcher and I cant say the quality is anywhere near as good as early GoT and I dont expect it to be but I am having a ball with the memes. It makes my mild disappointments with the show tolerable."
witcher,fcwwqxp,t1_fcwwfo3,1578040895.0,Yeah like why couldn't they do dark yellow CGI?? If they made purple look natural then why not the yellow...so frustrating. The first ep I was fine with it but now it's starting to get to me.

socialskills,fcvujsw,t1_fcvtgvo,1578010424.0,"I had one, but she was asking a lot more from me (emotional vampire style) than I could give due to work and school and other commitments even tho I have known her for a long time, so she decided to accuse me of being distant even tho I would see her every weekend. it was pretty disrespectful and insulting on her part. I'm currently best friend-less but am trying to find a better close friend.

I've been posting a lot on reddit for now to get my thoughts out since I dont have that friend anymore :/ I didnt want to continue the friendship with someone as clingy who blames others for their issues.

Oh well. It's a new year. Thanks for the tips."
AskReddit,fcvbiy8,t1_fcu1roc,1577998640.0,How did you both decide it wasnt working out? I'm frequently met with extreme disappointment if I politely declined a 2nd or 3rd date so friends is off the table :/
depression,fcv99ix,t1_fcv6yyx,1577997304.0,"Yeah...when I asked them why they were being distant they told me it was because they felt ""bummed out that I was uncomfortable sharing genuine feelings and only giving excuses"" ...but I did tell her how I was feeling but it wasnt enough for her.

I had told her I was hormonal and experiencing mild seasonal depression and she took that personally for some reason because I didnt go at length about it so her reaction was to ignore me. I dont know what else she wanted from me especially since I was spending almost all of my free time with her.

Really silly and I dont want a friend who would ignore me when they knew I needed support. I told her as much as I wanted to and she couldn't understand my boundaries. I always ask people if they want to talk or just cheering up, but she made it all about her. 

And yeah I lost friends when I've opened up to people so I just give cliff notes and try to get better. That's just how I deal and the emotional intimacy she wanted from me was just so odd and disrespectful of my needs.

I always understood her, but she never tried to understand me. I dont want a friend like that.

Thanks for reading. Hope you are well, internet friend."
NoStupidQuestions,fcv6t4j,t1_fcprtrc,1577995837.0,Yeah. I guess it's the intimacy of doing it with someone you like.

Even when I seemed perfectly happy a friend accused me of ""emotional distance"" because I didnt go into detail about the bard time I was having when I mentioned it...even when you spare people your misery you cant win.

witcher,fctszr8,t1_fbsrdxw,1577957938.0,yeah it's somehow more noticeable in ep 2 and 3...they could have just made them a tad bit darker so they're not bright  yellow at night...
witcher,fctsvoh,t3_edt7cl,1577957769.0,"Yeah I'm getting annoyed by them too. At first they looked great (oddly hot even), but the bright yellow in the dark looks strange...they should have digitally darkened them a bit like auburn in the dark.

offmychest,fcti4j5,t3_eit3wn,1577944053.0,"I'm in the exact same boat as you. My mom always tells me to try to get off of them, but when I have, I only see the faults in the world and instead of being motivated to try to fix them, I become discouraged and sometimes indifferent and just can't function day to day. It's hard to get through life when your two moods are apathy and sadness.

The switch of sorrow turning off is such an accurate description. It makes me feel like everyone else.

I always get a bit sad whenever people boast saying ""I don't take medication for anything, not even ibuprofen"" and I can't help but think they can't see out of their privileged bubble. Glad to know that their pain doesn't make them non-functioning, but some of us need something.

Without the invention meds, I would have probably died. But because I was born in the era of modern medicine, there is a way for me to make meaningful contributions to the world and I can only do that on antidepressants. 

I know they're not meant to be long term, but I don't know what else to do other than keep taking them. Hopefully they don't find out something terrible about them in the future.

Anyway, good luck to you. I hope you can find some peace. It's a daily battle for people like us."

I watched Rachel Getting Married recently and everyone was a token minority attending this white/black wedding that had an indian theme. So uncomfortable."
unpopularopinion,fctdkde,t1_fctd4f9,1577939881.0,"Yeah, that's exactly what I mean. And the showrunner said it's because it 's a show for ""many different countries"" ok but...it has to make sense? Just mixing up the races isn't changing anything but making it weird. It's ignoring ethnicity and genetics. 

Instead of just having black people take on these roles as if their race doesn't matter, there should be good stories written with black characters and their perspectives and stories. I'm just tired of hearing that ""race blind is bad because blackness is good"" and then also ""we're race blind and it doesn't matter for the story"" when at it's core it's still a white story...

I feel the same way for Hamilton...just because you made it rap and cast minorities, doesn't change the fact that these were slave owning white people. Why not write a play about Frederick Douglass or Harriet Tubman or other great black people? It's just another way to tell a white story without being accused of racism.

Here's my unpopular opinion for you lol"
unpopularopinion,fctcc8v,t1_fctc6ha,1577938834.0,"The Witcher is exactly what prompted this :( just having one random black guard felt so ""token black guy"" to me :/ I'm only on ep 2...and haven't read the books.

There isn't enough black people in the show to say that they exist in that world, it's a random scattering of humans and one elf so far. But if elves are one race, then how does that work? It feels off. I wish they made a specific ""race"" in the show black or something...

It's like pretending ethnic background doesn't exist and we all just originated together in one area. As a child of immigrants with a strong connection to my homeland, it just feels weird to me. Especially when the showrunner of the Witcher said "" Polish culture not being synonymous with whiteness"" but Polish people are a specific ethnicity?? It feels offensive to both minorities and others."

After another ride on the stationary bike, I think maybe the instability I'm feeling is from my left knee and ankle for some reason. Every since I was a kid when I would ride a bike I felt something catching or moving in that knee.  Not painful, just weird. No problems with my right one. Primary doctor looked at it and said nothing seems to be wrong. It only does it on the bike and she couldn't hear or detect any clicking or swelling. 

I suspect it might be a tracking issue and depending on how my ankle is, I feel it less, so I figured if I keep it that way with no float it would help. I might see a physical therapist to see if any athletic tape might help. It's not painful, but because of that weird feeling, I think I automatically put less weight on it without realizing and it makes me feel unstable.

It's hard for me to push myself when I feel it. It's worse when I sit up and am hands free so maybe my quad is pulling it too or something. I want to get it fixed so that I can keep cycling indoors and then outdoors as well once I get fitter."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fc7h9cp,t3_egg4vz,1577507388.0,Reading this currently sitting alone at the movies...one can hope. Tho the entire row of seats next to me were marked as sold no one is here lolol
introvert,fc756lr,t1_fc6mon8,1577497830.0,"my friend who I saw every single weekend even multiple days in a row became snappy with me via text and when I asked what's wrong she said I had been ""emotionally distant"" and it ""bummed her out"" since she ""needs it to cultivate something close to someone"" and I realized she was sucking the life out of me and not understanding that if I was distracted or delayed a text by an hour, I was busy with family and grad school and full time work. She accused me of being a bad friend when I was giving her all the free time I had...pretty insulting.

Now that I'm not hanging out with her or obligated to cater to her needs I'm realizing how much work it was just to be her friend. I'm so relaxed and happy."
introvert,fc6ksxa,t1_fc6ilti,1577482933.0,"I would always go see movies with my one closest friend who loves movies, but after a recent falling out in which I realized I was constantly overwhelmed by her, I feel so free now."
offmychest,fc55glp,t1_fc55a1y,1577444161.0,"truly. 

sometimes when I bring it up people say it was pedophile-y or manipulative and I don't really get that... It was about youth and innocence and how people experiences these things and learn from them, even if they hurt really bad and there is nothing you can do. even if you felt a strong connection to someone, it may not have been the right time or place and life isn't fair. It just is.

anyway, thanks for reading. hope you are having a good night."
cycling,fc553mx,t1_fc4l1me,1577443615.0,"ugh I am also unhappy with the bike...the iFit app is garbage. I tried a  trail ride and it only takes the resistance from 4 to 6 for hills and you don't even feel the difference so I had to manually adjust it from 8 to 12. there is almost no difference in the lower resistances at least for me. most of the rides are designed for the bike that has the ""incline"" feature so it's pretty useless...and you can't search or change difficulty.

my bike is also making this sound: https://youtu.be/LTvjNfhw-uM and I don't know if that's typical for spin bikes or not...I emailed and messaged them but no response :/ they seem to have horrendous reviews for their customer service and are now ""giving"" a bike for ""free"" if you sign up for a multi year membership for their app which is so expensive and essentially you're paying for the bike. I changed my credit card so they can't automatically charge me after my free year since I heard it's really hard to cancel.

I did change my pedals to SPD clipless ones because the quality of the cages seemed flimsy and I have SPD cleat shoes. 

I heard a lot about the sunny health ones on amazon, but if this bike is functioning fine and the noise is normal, I'll suck it up and just manually change the resistances myself :/ hope you get a response"
NoStupidQuestions,fc3g7zz,t1_fc3e3ei,1577389107.0,"good idea thank you! I'm leaning towards this or maybe also some kind of skincare or makeup kit (they're all ladies that seem to use a lot of makeup), but the cooking stuff seems like a safer bet! Thank you!!"
relationship_advice,fc24wly,t1_fc23y0z,1577340563.0,"Yeah she always had a bad habit of blaming others for her feelings (""the professor GAVE me a D"" instead of I earned a D) and I guess it was only a matter of time before I was the target...

I just feel sad because I have so many memories with her and never thought we would part, but it was entirely her doing and I'm done being played."
relationship_advice,fc23nc6,t1_fc229so,1577339089.0,"Yeah I'm generally pretty easy going, but once I got that text I was pretty hurt and offended at how she interpreted things. The demand for emotional closeness was so WEIRD and she made my mental health about her?! It's my boundary! And she said ""it's not a boundary it's a wall and I need that to feel close to someone"" GIRL, I can only give you so much of my time and now you want my emotions?

Thanks for this. It's been about a week I haven't talked to her. She was the one that started this ""distancing"" thing over regular adult life things that happen and made it all about her. Even when she ""asked"" how I was doing it was ""you posted a seasonal depression meme on twitter and it's hard for me to see that"" IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUUUU.

ok sorry, thank you for this. I feel a bit free, but just needed confirmation. And she's friends with this guy I kind of like and want to get to know better...oh well."
relationship_advice,fc23hzq,t1_fc22snh,1577338916.0,"Yeah. I honestly do not understand what she means by I was ""emotionally distant"" ...and who is she to say that my explanation of ""I'm just hormonal and a getting a bit of seasonal depression"" is just an excuse?! As if I owe her...and also she made my mental health about how she felt? How does someone even do that...

Yeah it was manipulative. I felt guilt tripped by a few of her comments like ""ok but you have to be 100% committed if you say something otherwise I get sad"" ...ok but we're adults?

It just makes me sad because we did so much together the past 6 years or so. I hope I can find new friends."
relationship_advice,fc23ea5,t1_fc22d3a,1577338799.0,"Yeah...I had imagined that if I were distant, busy, overwhelmed, or having a ""hard time"" a friend would understand and be there for me and check in when we had time and support me in the way that I need. 

Instead she took my response which was ""I'm just hormonal and overwhelmed and having a bit of seasonal depression"" as I was ""too uncomfortable with her to share and it was hard to digest because it was just excuses and not genuine feelings"" WHAT ELSE WAS I SUPPOSED TO SAY?! Also, it's not about YOU?!

And she sent that text right AFTER I sent her a job posting because I knew she was unhappy with her job...I realized I was always understanding of her but she was never understanding of me. I never really expected her too because she's never had a full time job and only just finished undergrad at 27 still living off of her parents...but at this point because when her insecurities about her life are projected onto me I don't have the bandwidth to deal with it anymore. She essentially made everything I did about her and I'm like...I am SO busy I don't even have time to talk to my parents and I was hanging out with you every weekend?

Thanks. Yeah she called me a bad friend when in reality she is the one who is unreliable and selfish."
offmychest,fbyd6vt,t1_fbtv9do,1577213944.0,"Yeah...I think that's the core of it whether she knows it or not. I know if I respond I'll have to take some losses in the discussion...like I wont be able to say that what she did was unwarranted, immature, and unfriend-like because it won't work and she always said ""I distanced myself because of your actions"" but then in another text ""I didnt actively plan to distance myself from you"" when I said that what she did wasnt what a friend does. And tbh I absolutely do not understand what she means by ""emotional distance""...does she not understand that when someone is distracted or has other responsibilities that it's not personal? I can't be put in that much pressure to keep her happy.

I cant fix her insecurities with how she felt she was ""bothering me and others as well""...I cant be held accountable for her internal problems she blames others for. I even said ""I saw you every weekend..."" and she said ""I dont keep tabs on how often I see you"" but maybe if she did she could refer back to it to see in reality that I am not distant.

Anyway thanks. I dont know what to do because I really dont have time or energy to deal with this over the holidays. Hope you have a nice holiday season."
