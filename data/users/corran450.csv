Naturally, it will go faster if we get more active seasoned players... I realize this is a hard sale to most players, but if you don’t have a fleet already, why not hop on? We’ve got some decent perks (who wouldn’t want to replicate twice more per day?)... it could be more, if anyone is interested. Every one of our players is a daily player, and we’re scrappy! Lol."
