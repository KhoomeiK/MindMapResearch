I went up on the roof, there were plenty of places he could have jumped from to hit the ground, but this spot was next to the chimney & was the easiest place to get over the 3’ parapet wall.

He ended up surviving for another decade.

People are often at their absolute worst when committing suicide. They aren’t thinking straight, are in crisis, are often intoxicated etc. you really can’t assume someone trying to mill themselves will be calm and rational."
news,fe9u6aj,t1_fe9qrwm,1578941455.0,"I trust the person with time behind the wheel to make that call, maybe it’s just not on their way home. You want to optimize your time working to make the most money possible, location is a big part of that as are tell return fairs.

But whatever their rational or reason, it’s their choice to make. If you don’t like the choices someone makes, the solution isn’t to take away their ability to choose.

I saw an analysis of uber driver data looking for gender discrepancy & it was pretty large. It wasn’t an issue of bias tho (tips were the only place to introduce bias), but of driver strategy.

Let these people control their time & their cars as much as possible. The people who need to work gig economy need protection, not punishment for being of the oppressor class.

Allowing some percentage of drivers to not take fares for reasons you don’t agree with is the lesser evil. The drivers are the vulnerable population, not the passengers.

It’s like worrying miss daisy is being taken advantage of."

I make no comment on this case whatsoever, but people often aren’t thinking clearly or rationally in their final moments."
HongKong,fe9pf0j,t1_fe9ek84,1578940311.0,">	It just makes no sense to choose to jump out there.

... people aren’t known for being rational & pragmatic in their final moments before suicide.

I make no comment whatsoever on this particular case, but a suicide not making sense doesn’t tell you anything."
news,fe9jvvm,t1_fe9c4as,1578938426.0,"There are a whole host of legitimate & rational reasons a driver might not want to take a certain ride at a given time. Some of those reasons might track with the class or race of riders in such a way you can argue racism, but I am much more worried about the rights and welfare of the drivers than those who can afford to be the riders.

The working class people need protection much more than the people who can afford to use their services. 

Drivers are already struggling enough that no one should feel good about taking away the information they need to decide where & when they drive their cars & themselves. Most drivers are optimizing for $$ first, safety second & bias last if at all. Any information covered under who, what, where, when, why should be available A.S.A.P & that should be covered under a workers bill of rights.

Investors and shareholders can take the hit & pay the cost  to protect their investments common carrier status.  It’s better to reward the good drivers who take the fares you care about, or make those fares more attractive to all drivers until all demographics are adequately served."
news,fe91dvl,t1_fe8z8vl,1578933156.0,"If drivers are making the rational choice to not take certain rides, then make those rides more attractive. Don’t hide the information & try to trick drivers into behaving irrationally.

Charge more for those rides, waive Ubers fee for the rides, enter them into a lotto, triple weight good reviews so drivers on the edge will go after these rides...

When you intentionally make the system less efficient it responds in kind. Drivers waste their time & yours canceling rides at the last minute."
askscience,fe8wl7y,t1_fe8dv7b,1578931883.0,"Don’t devalue your sympathy.

Just being recognized as a person deserving of consideration can be a big deal. There was a period of about 18 months where I didn’t have access to any kind of kindness like a smile or a pat on the back & that alone will make a person sick.

It’s relatively easy for most people to contextualize the presence of something bad in life, but it’s much harder for people to imagine the effects of the absence of good. 

You are doing well & you are doing good. I bet it’s worth more to people than you realize.

People who need just a little bit more care and consideration end up getting less. Men are especially vulnerable to this, my sister r.i.p. was in the same boat & about as similar to me as you can get. I’ve always been surprised at just how differently the same struggle & issue is viewed, cared for, or cared about.

I’m just complaining, but I think we would see tremendous benefits to society at large  if we started doing better by this population."
askscience,fe86t8h,t1_fe7cv8h,1578923204.0,"I think a lot of abused kids end up as very empathetic adults.

The stakes are so high when you are a powerless kid dealing with an abuser that you invest a lot in theory of mind in order to understand your abuser & thus how to keep yourself safe.

Those skills don’t disappear & it’s harder to be callous or cruel to a person you understand.

I only bring this up because so many people see the damaged goods, but not the silver lining."

It’s like a romcom with 90 minutes of stupidity based on a misunderstanding. 

You couldn’t explain you didn’t take a close look at the picture?
