Also, multiple religions argue that the Christian God is a false God considering every religion has a God or Gods of their own to worship and don‚Äôt believe in Jesus. Why is THIS God the one we should believe when other religions preceded Christianity and spoke of other Gods?

If all is already planned by God the idea of choice is an illusion. So this being makes me believe I have choice, yet has already predetermined the outcome of my life and every other person on the planet, only to bait and switch. What the actual fuck? Sounds like an asshole to me, not a God.
